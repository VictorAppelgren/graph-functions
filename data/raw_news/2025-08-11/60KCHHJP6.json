  "title": "Picking Leeds United\u2019s 2025-26 breakout player: Harry Gray",
  "description": "Harry Gray is likely to be fourth-choice striker for Leeds United this season, but he's ready to take his chance when it comes...",
  "content": "It\u2019s a tale people will be bored of hearing when they speak to me about Harry Gray. If you read The Athletic\u2019s March feature on the teenager, you will know this one, too, but the context it provides is important.\n\nDarren Arnott, a former youth coach at Leeds United, told me about one occasion he was speaking with Aaron Lennon in 2024 at Thorp Arch, the club\u2019s training ground. Lennon, who was coaching the under-18s at the time, played with the likes of Jermain Defoe, Robbie Keane, Gareth Bale and Dimitar Berbatov during his career.\n\nBear those names in mind when Arnott said: \u201cI remember Aaron coming in from doing some finishing with him (Gray) and he was just shaking his head, laughing, saying, \u2018He finishes off his left foot as good as any senior pro I\u2019ve seen\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a neat story that summarises the kind of comments that have followed Gray since he first started playing in United\u2019s academy. Despite the best efforts of everyone around him to manage the public narrative about his rise, there is only so much they can do once he\u2019s in the first-team spotlight.\n\nPeople are always going to talk about exciting and talented young footballers, especially when they come from the most successful and beloved family in Leeds United history. Gray turns 17 in October and will undoubtedly play in the Premier League next season.\n\nThe striker and his family will know there is no stopping the buzz on the biggest domestic stage in world football. If Gray dazzles in a cameo, scores or assists, the media attention will be immense. That will not be a surprise to father Andy, grandfather Frank, great uncle Eddie, or brother Archie.\n\nSources at Leeds, speaking anonymously to protect relationships, as well as coaches like Arnott, have underlined Gray\u2019s confidence. If he gets chances under Daniel Farke next season, he will back himself to make a difference on the pitch.\n\nFarke himself commented on Gray\u2019s keenness to be at the front of May\u2019s title celebrations, despite having contributed only five minutes on the pitch for the senior side.\n\nIf he is set to be one of England\u2019s best strikers over the next 15 years, goals at 17 years old in the top flight may not be out of the question. Everyone develops at different rates.\n\nHarry Kane, England\u2019s record goalscorer, did not make his Premier League debut until he was 19 and did not score until he was 20. Wayne Rooney, an extreme example as one of the country\u2019s finest footballers of all time, made his debut in August 2002 and scored that free kick against Arsenal two months later, before he turned 17.\n\nMichael Owen was 17 when he scored on his Premier League debut for Liverpool in May 1997. Alan Shearer made his top-flight debut at 17 before scoring a hat-trick two weeks later against Arsenal in 1988.\n\nClearly, those are four of the greatest English centre-forwards to play the game. It\u2019s a high bar and their feats should not mean Gray will mimic them, but it\u2019s laid out as an example of why it\u2019s feasible this coming season could be his breakthrough.\n\nThe fact is, going into the new season, for all of the hype, Gray has very little experience in the first team. Earlier introductions from the bench will be the next step for him.\n\nJoel Piroe and Lukas Nmecha are ahead of him in the pecking order, but it is no secret Leeds want another addition good enough to start regularly at the tip of their attack. The loan exit of Mateo Joseph and the exclusion of Patrick Bamford will only aid Gray\u2019s hopes of getting on the field.\n\nIf we assume he is going to be the fourth-choice striker in a one-striker system, it does manage expectations. Injuries and poor form will be needed from the three ahead of Gray to give him that chance, but if he impresses on the field, he will ask that question of Farke.\n\nMost likely, Gray will play the majority of his football with the under-21s in Premier League 2 next term. First-team minutes in the cups could be where he catches the eye.\n\nIt could be that 2026-27, when Gray turns 18, proves to be the striker\u2019s real push for senior minutes. Farke, evidently, wants to aid that process. He took Gray to Germany for 2024\u2019s pre-season camp, where a back injury halted his progress for several months.\n\nHe went with the team to Sweden and Germany again this summer. He already has a tall frame, which will probably grow another inch or two before he starts to bulk out properly. His versatility as a No 9 or No 10 will help him, too, though the former is his more natural role.\n\nHe has scored all kinds of goals in the youth ranks, where the only challenge coaches could find was pitting him against opponents two or three years older.\n\nYou will not catch Farke pumping Gray\u2019s tyres up publicly, but he knows what kind of talent he has on his hands. He has to manage him carefully and unleash him at the right moment.",

      "text": "\u201cYou\u2019re Harry\u2019s brother, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nWhen you ask people who have watched Harry Gray\u2019s development at Leeds United\u2019s training ground over the years, an anecdote keeps cropping up \u2014 one given weight by his elder brother Archie\u2019s meteoric rise.\nMultiple sources, who like others in this article spoke under the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, said Archie, as good as he was, would be described as \u201cHarry\u2019s brother\u201d as he rose through the age groups at Leeds, despite being the older sibling. Furthermore, people meeting Archie for the first time would sometimes ask him if he was Harry\u2019s brother.\nAdvertisement\nWhen you now consider Archie, 18, is about to complete a maiden Premier League campaign with Tottenham Hotspur after a \u00a340million move from Leeds last summer, it says a lot about Harry\u2019s reputation.\nHarry, 16, is making waves with Leeds\u2019 under-21 side while he trains with a first-team squad currently leading the race for automatic promotion from the Championship.\nHe\u2019s a talent who might not be a secret for much longer.\nLast summer, Leeds fans suffered a devastating loss when Archie Gray moved on.\nThe Grays are synonymous with the club, with several members of the family having played for them since the 1960s, but the blow of that transfer to Spurs was softened by the emergence of his younger brother in pre-season.\nHarry Gray, then 15, made a non-competitive senior debut in a July friendly at Yorkshire neighbours Harrogate Town and was one of five outfield youngsters chosen by manager Daniel Farke to be part of a subsequent pre-season training camp in Germany.\nWhispers about Gray had been leaking from Leeds\u2019 training ground Thorp Arch for years, about mythical 10-goals-a-game splurges, but his inclusion in the party travelling to Germany was the first public admission of the quality of player Leeds had on their hands.\nGray returned from that trip with a back problem caused by his age and growing. It was nothing major and he was managed through the subsequent months before returning to match action in Premier League 2 in mid-January. Regular minutes with the under-21s in that competition are expected over the rest of the season, but all eyes will be on when Farke gives him that senior debut.\nAndy Wright was in the Leeds squad that won the 1996-97 FA Youth Cup and is now lead coach with the Yorkshire-based i2i International Soccer Academy. His professional coaching experience stretches to 12 years, but he spent six of them at the heart of Leeds\u2019 academy. He first came across Gray in the under-10s at Thorp Arch, then watched his development more closely from under-12s to under-14s.\nAdvertisement\nOf all the young talents Wright has worked with, he was asked what makes Gray stand out: \u201cIt\u2019s his mentality. His desire to win certainly set him apart. The standards he expected for himself were always absolutely above and beyond anything else.\n\u201cHow could I describe him as a player? He was just doing things you wouldn\u2019t expect. He could win a match on his own when you probably wouldn\u2019t expect him to do that. He would do things you\u2019d just think, \u2018Wow\u2019. His finishing stood out, with both feet. He could beat you one-on-one, he could hold up the ball, back to goal, spin you and chip the goalkeeper. He could run in behind.\n\u201cAs a coach, you try not to get too excited, you\u2019re wondering where they\u2019re going to end up, but this kid\u2019s really, really special. That\u2019s the only way I could describe him.\u201d\nDarren Arnott is currently head coach of Hong Kong\u2019s under-20 and under-23 teams, having previously had three spells working in Leeds\u2019 academy. Most recently, he was there from January 2023 until May last year, coaching across the under-15, under-16 and under-18 sides. He was part of the coaching staff for last season\u2019s run to the FA Youth Cup final.\nThe comparison of Gray with his older brother was a natural starting point.\nArnott says: \u201cI was fortunate to work a little bit in the past with Archie when he was younger. The boys have a very similar kind of mindset. They\u2019re really good problem-solvers.\n\u201c(Harry) is hyper in everything. His learning style is interesting because he would be the one at the back of the group juggling a football while you make a group intervention. It could be perceived as lacking focus, but you ask him what you\u2019ve said and he could recite it with his eyes closed. He\u2019s hyper-intelligent. His thinking frequency is buzzing at a much higher level. He just loves challenges.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe Gray name could be a burden for weaker minds.\nFor those who aren\u2019t aware, Gray\u2019s great-uncle, Eddie, is a Leeds United legend, having made 579 appearances and helped win numerous trophies in the 1960s and 1970s, including two domestic titles and an FA Cup. His grandfather, Frank, was a part of the club\u2019s 1970s successes, too, playing 396 times across two spells. Harry\u2019s father, Andy, clocked up 38 Leeds games, also in two stints. Archie got to 52 before that switch to Tottenham.\nWright says: \u201cEven though he\u2019ll have the pressure of the family name, that never bothers Harry. I\u2019ve never seen a kid play with such belief and absolutely no fear. I still speak with people at the club, so I know he\u2019s training with the first team. That won\u2019t phase him one bit. He\u2019ll embrace it, he\u2019ll enjoy the challenge and he\u2019ll really back himself as well. That self-belief is really big in Harry.\u201d\nGray has been surrounded by football his whole life but does not seem to shy away from that.\nArnott tells an insightful story about one analysis session at Thorp Arch last season: \u201cI remember one time he came in early for the analysis session and the analyst put the TV on to try to set the laptop up and there\u2019s a Scottish Premiership game on.\n\u201cAs the analyst was about to change the input to the HDMI, Harry went, \u2018Oh, wait, they\u2019ll score in a second. Wait, wait, wait\u2019. They scored. I went, \u2018How did you know that?\u2019. He said, \u2018I watched it seven days ago. He scores, then he gets a free kick, puts it here and he does this, does that\u2019. It\u2019s like an encyclopedia of football in his brain. He has a pure love for the game.\u201d\nGray needs a challenge, his former coaches say. Not only was he pushed up the age groups to play against older opponents, but coaches had to delve deeper into their toolboxes to tap into his potential.\nAdvertisement\nBespoke training programmes were devised for him that utilised him in different ways across the under-15, under-16 and under-18 teams. With the under-18s, for example, Gray would be deployed as a single striker and asked to play off the shoulder \u2014 see less of the ball but score a hatful of goals.\nWith the under-15s, he may have been playing against his own age group, but the coaches wanted to make it harder for him. In last season\u2019s Under-15 Premier League Floodlit Super Cup final, Gray was given the responsibility of the captaincy and asked to play as a No 10, dictating play as the heartbeat of the team. He was described as \u201cexceptional\u201d in the game by one source, though Leeds lost 5-3 to Chelsea.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not someone you would show a specific technique to,\u201d Arnott says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t try to teach him that way.\n\u201cYou would challenge him by saying, \u2018Hey, Harry. I saw the other day a player did this on this angle and lifted it over the \u2019keeper, or put it through his legs from this tight angle, or put it in the near top corner with his weak foot. That\u2019s a great finish\u2019.\n\u201cIn half an hour, he\u2019s trying to work it out and figure it out for himself. He does it quickly. He adapts.\n\u201cWhen you move him from under-15s and up, he adapts super-fast. You put him with the under-18s, he scores goals, but maybe his overall game isn\u2019t brilliant in the first phase. Then, after a couple of games, he understands the game and it\u2019s easy for him. You put him with the under-21s, the same thing happens. You put him in the first team, I hope and pray, the same thing happens and I imagine it will.\u201d\nThe Leeds first team is where this is all ultimately leading.\nGray and his family understand the talk around him is just hype unless he delivers. His drive to succeed is evident and Thorp Arch sources say he has always been conscious of his brother Archie\u2019s benchmarks and wants to surpass them.\nThe family dynamic is central to all of this. Those spoken to about the brothers can only wax lyrical about them as human beings. They have had their feet kept on the ground.\nOf the boys\u2019 father, Wright says: \u201cHow he supports them, supports their development, as a dad, that really helped the pair of them. The family behind them as well, supporting them on the journey. Andy was brilliant for them.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cAndy\u2019s kept them grounded and (made them) good people. Harry has some brilliant traits as a person and as a player. It was great to get to know him, but Andy really kept their feet on the ground and when they did get a little bit ahead of themselves, he would knock them down a peg or two. I\u2019ve certainly seen that, first-hand. The family\u2019s got to take a lot of praise. It\u2019s the whole Gray family, but they\u2019ve been there and done it, really good people.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThere is a natural inclination, across youth football, to manage expectations. Experienced coaches know they are talking about impressionable teenagers. And yet, those who have worked with Gray felt it would have done the young striker a disservice to not describe him as they have done in this article. They know he\u2019d brush off any praise.\nThe former Leeds, Spurs and England winger Aaron Lennon was a part of the club\u2019s under-18 coaching staff last season. In October, Lennon told UK radio station talkSPORT of Gray: \u201cHe is ridiculous. He\u2019s frightening. He\u2019s a No 10, No 9. I don\u2019t want to talk about him too much because I think everyone will want him, he\u2019s that good. He\u2019s probably the best I\u2019ve seen in years.\u201d\nLennon has played with the likes of Jermain Defoe, Robbie Keane, Gareth Bale and Dimitar Berbatov, yet Arnott recalls: \u201cI remember Aaron coming in from doing some finishing with him and he was just shaking his head, laughing, saying, \u2018He finishes off his left foot as good as any senior pro I\u2019ve seen\u2019.\u201d\nDuring his aforementioned FA Youth Cup win in 1997, Wright played with and against the best young footballers in the country. He thinks Gray is on a par with those talents. \u201cIt\u2019s the finishing that wasn\u2019t normal for me,\u201d he said. \u201cHis right foot\u2019s unbelievable, but you put him on his left and he hits the ball so cleanly and it\u2019s gone; it\u2019s like a bullet and it\u2019s in the back of the net.\n\u201cWhen I was a younger player, I played with some very, very good players. He\u2019s better than them. The Michael Owens I\u2019ve played with. For finishing, he\u2019s as good as I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n(Top photo: Richard Sellers/PA Images via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Patrick Bamford has been told by Daniel Farke he will not be a part of his Leeds United plans next season.\nThe England international was absent from Saturday\u2019s friendly against Manchester United in Stockholm and Farke revealed his decision post-match.\nThe striker arrived seven years ago from Middlesbrough and has played 205 times for Leeds since, scoring 60 goals. However, injuries have hindered his ability to string starts together since September 2021.\nAdvertisement\nThat injury record ultimately proved to be too much for Farke to gamble on as he takes the team back to the top flight.\n\u201cWith Patrick, I had a really open and honest conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have preferred a completely fit Patrick Bamford in the last two seasons.\n\u201cHe knows how much I rate him as a person. It was the second day of pre-season when I told him in my office he wasn\u2019t part of my plans for the upcoming Premier League season, due to the fact he\u2019s had really difficult years over the past years.\u201d\nBamford has one year remaining on the contract he signed four years ago, after scoring 17 goals in United\u2019s run to ninth in the top flight, and he is understood to be one of the highest earners at Elland Road.\nFarke believes the 31-year-old has done too much in his career to now be a back-up option at Elland Road and he expects him to flourish as a first-choice striker elsewhere.\n\u201cFor me, Patrick is someone who needs to be the main man,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he gets this, he will score goals at every level because he\u2019s a top player, but after the last few seasons, I wasn\u2019t willing to do this and say he was our main man at Premier League level.\n\u201cWith the CV he\u2019s had at Leeds United, he shouldn\u2019t be a back-up option. This is not what you should be when you are the main man for so many years.\n\u201cHe has trained really professionally and his reaction was top class, as expected. He liked the openness and honesty.\n\u201cPatrick has done so much for this club over the last seven years, winning two promotions. He trained with us over the first two weeks, but I told him, once we go to the training camp, I will reduce the striker group, so that\u2019s why I made this cut right now.\u201d\nLeeds travel to Germany now for a one-week training camp. Brenden Aaronson will join the team there to begin his pre-season, which was delayed by his USMNT commitments this summer.\nAdvertisement\nJack Harrison made his first Leeds appearance since May 2023 in Saturday\u2019s draw with Manchester United. Farke has said the winger\u2019s future will depend on how he grasps the opportunity which has been given to him, citing the way Junior Firpo and Aaronson managed to turn the tide of public opinion with hard work and consistency.\nMateo Joseph was another striker missing from Saturday\u2019s squad. Farke said the forward did not feel ready to play after a slightly delayed start to pre-season following Spain under-21 duty.\nThe manager did not guarantee Joseph would still be with the squad for the start of next season, but made it clear how highly he rated the youngster and wanted to retain the club\u2019s best players this summer.\n(Ryan Hiscott/Getty Images)"
