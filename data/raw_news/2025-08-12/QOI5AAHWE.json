  "description": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug.  06, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) \u2014 Taseko Mines Limited (TSX: TKO; NYSE American: TGB; LSE: TKO) (\u201cTaseko\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) reports se\u2026",
  "content": "In the second quarter, Gibraltar completed the refurbishment and successfully restarted its solvent extraction and electrowinning (\u201cSX/EW\u201d) plant which had been idle since 2015 and produced 395 thousand pounds of copper cathode. Capitalized stripping costs totaling $30.8 million remained higher in the second quarter attributable to a higher than normal strip ratio for sulphide ore tons in the Connector pit. Total site costs* including capitalized stripping was $116.8 million in the quarter, higher than the prior quarter primarily due to higher mining rates. Total site costs were also higher than the prior year quarter due to mill downtime in 2024 related to a labour strike and crusher relocation project. Molybdenum production was 180 thousand pounds in the second quarter, comparable to 185 thousand pounds in the comparative prior year quarter. At an average molybdenum price of US$20.71 per pound for the quarter, molybdenum contributed a by-product credit of US$0.19 per pound of copper produced. Off-property costs of US$0.18 per pound of copper produced were consistent with the prior quarter and reflect Gibraltar\u2019s 2025 offtake agreements with average treatment and refining charges (\u201cTCRC\u201d) of $nil for the year. Total operating (C1) costs* were US$3.14 per pound of copper produced in the second quarter compared to US$2.99 per pound of copper produced in the comparative prior year quarter. The increase in total operating (C1) costs was attributable to low site operating costs in the prior year from mill downtime, as well as lower copper production and lower molybdenum by-product credits in the current quarter, partially offset by higher capitalized stripping costs and lower off-property costs as outlined in the bridge graph below: Mining activity will continue to advance in the Connector pit, which will be the primary source of mill feed for the remainder of 2025 and the years ahead. Significant increases in head grades and recoveries, and higher mill throughput from processing the softer Connector pit ore, are expected in the second half of 2025 and continuing into 2026. Copper production for the year is expected to be 110 to 120 million pounds, including cathode production. Molybdenum production is also forecast to increase in the second half of 2025 as molybdenum grades are expected to be notably higher in Connector pit ore. The Company has offtake agreements covering Gibraltar concentrate production in 2025 and 2026, which contain significantly lower and in certain cases negative (premium) TCRC rates reflecting the tight copper smelting market. Offtake agreements are in place for substantially all of Gibraltar\u2019s copper concentrate production in 2025 and 2026, and, based on the contract terms, the Company expects average TCRCs to be to around $nil in 2025 and 2026. The Company has a prudent hedging program in place to protect a minimum copper price and Gibraltar cash flow during the Florence Copper construction period. Currently, the Company has copper collar contracts in place that secure a minimum copper price of US$4.00 per pound for 54 million pounds of copper production for the remainder of 2025 (refer to \u201cFinancial Condition Review\u2014Hedging Strategy\u201d for details).\n\nThe Company has all the key permits in place for the commercial production facility at Florence and construction continues to advance on schedule. Over 900,000 project hours have been worked with no reportable injuries or environmental incidents. The Company has a fixed-price contract with the general contractor for construction of the SX/EW plant and associated surface infrastructure and activities are beginning to wind down from peak spend in the first quarter. All injection and recovery wells planned to be drilled during the construction phase were completed as of June 30, 2025. Remaining construction activities are advancing on plan and project areas will soon start transitioning to commissioning. Operational readiness remains a key focus for site management. Site activities are focused on hiring additional personnel and developing detailed operating plans for the ramp up of production, which is expected to begin before the end of this year. Florence Copper commercial facility construction costs were US$33.0 million in the second quarter and US$239.3 million has been incurred on the Florence Copper commercial facility construction as of June 30, 2025. The Company has a technical report titled \u201cNI 43-101 Technical Report Florence Copper Project, Pinal County, Arizona\u201d dated March 30, 2023 (the \u201cFlorence 2023 Technical Report\u201d) on SEDAR+. The Florence 2023 Technical Report was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43\u2011101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) and incorporated the results of test work from the production test facility (\u201cPTF\u201d) as well as updated capital and operating costs (Q3 2022 basis) for the commercial production facility. Project highlights based on the Florence 2023 Technical Report are detailed below:\n\u2022 Net present value of US$930 million (at US$3.75 copper price, 8% after-tax discount rate);\n\u2022 Operating costs (C1) of US$1.11 per pound of copper produced;\n\u2022 Total life of mine production of 1.5 billion pounds of copper; and Based on the Florence 2023 Technical Report, the estimated construction costs for the Florence Copper commercial production facility were US$232 million and management continues to expect that total construction costs will be within 10% to 15% of this estimate. Taseko\u2019s strategy has been to grow the company by acquiring and developing a pipeline of projects focused on copper in North America. We continue to believe this will generate long-term returns for shareholders. Our other development projects are located in BC, Canada. The Yellowhead copper project (\u201cYellowhead\u201d) is expected to produce 4.4 billion pounds of copper over a 25-year mine life at an average C1 cost, net of by-product credit, of US$1.90 per pound of copper produced. During the first 5 years of operation, Yellowhead is expected to produce an average of 206 million pounds of copper per year at an average C1 cost, net of by-product credit, of US$1.62 per pound of copper produced. Yellowhead also contains valuable precious metal by-products with 282,000 ounces of gold production and 19.4 million ounces of silver production over the life of mine.\n\nThe converter pilot test is ongoing to provide additional process data to support the design of commercial process facilities, and final product samples to support product marketing initiatives. The Company is also conducting a scoping study to investigate the potential for Aley niobium oxide production to supply the growing market for niobium-based batteries. The Company\u2019s Annual General Meeting was held on June 12, 2025 and shareholders voted in favor of all items of business before the meeting, including the continuation of the Company\u2019s amended and restated shareholders rights plan for a 3-year period and the advisory resolution on executive compensation (Say-on-Pay), and the election of all director nominees. Detailed voting results for the 2025 Annual General Meeting are available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. In June 2025, the Company published its annual Sustainability Report titled C2 (Copper x Community) (the \u201cReport\u201d). The Report highlights Taseko\u2019s operational and sustainability achievements, with an emphasis on the connection between copper production and the people, communities, and social environments that support and benefit from our operations and projects. With 20 years of successful operations under Taseko\u2019s stewardship, 2024 marked a milestone year for the Company\u2019s flagship operation, the Gibraltar mine. As Canada\u2019s second-largest copper mine, Gibraltar continues to reflect Taseko\u2019s commitment to operational excellence, health and safety, and delivering \u2018360\u00b0 of Value\u2019 for all stakeholders. Florence Copper will soon become one of the lowest carbon and energy-intensive copper producers in the world, offering domestically produced, traceable and high-purity copper metal to support North American manufacturing and economic security. While profitable operations and return on investment are critical drivers for Taseko\u2019s success, the Company also delivers value to its employees and operating communities, business partners, Indigenous Nations and governments. The Report is an opportunity to showcase the important benefits that the Company generates through its operations, investments and people. The full report can be viewed and downloaded at www.tasekomines.com/sustainability/overview. Conference Call and Webcast The Company will host a telephone conference call and live webcast on Thursday August 7, 2025 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Pacific) to discuss these results. After opening remarks by management, there will be a question and answer session open to analysts and investors. The conference call may be accessed by dialing 800-715-9871 toll free or 646-307-1963, using the access code 2521595.

For further information on Taseko, see the Company\u2019s website at tasekomines.com or contact: No regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of the information contained in this news release This MD&A includes certain non-GAAP performance measures that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. These measures may differ from those used by, and may not be comparable to such measures as reported by, other issuers. The Company believes that these measures are commonly used by certain investors, in conjunction with conventional IFRS measures, to enhance their understanding of the Company\u2019s performance. These measures have been derived from the Company\u2019s financial statements and applied on a consistent basis. The following tables below provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures.\n\nTotal operating cost includes all costs absorbed into inventory, as well as transportation costs and insurance recoverable. Site operating cost is calculated by removing net changes in inventory, depletion and amortization, insurance recoverable, and transportation costs from cost of sales. Site operating cost, net of by-product credit is calculated by subtracting by-product credits from site operating cost. Site operating cost, net of by-product credit per pound is calculated by dividing the aggregate of the applicable costs by pounds of copper produced. Total operating cost per pound is the sum of site operating costs, net of by-product credits and off-property costs divided by pounds of copper produced. By-product credit is calculated based on actual sales of molybdenum (net of treating costs) and silver during the period divided by the total pounds of copper produced during the period. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented. Average exchange rate for the period (Cdn$ / US$) Total site costs include site operating costs charged to cost of sales and mining costs capitalized to property, plant and equipment in the period. This measure is intended to capture total site operating costs incurred during the period calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented. Adjusted net income (loss) removes the effect of the following transactions from net income (loss) as reported under IFRS:\n\u2022 Loss on settlement of debt, net of capitalized interest;\n\u2022 Gain on acquisition of control of Gibraltar;\n\u2022 Inventory write-ups to fair value that was sold or processed;\n\u2022 Tax effect of sale of non-recurring interest; and Management believes these transactions do not reflect the underlying operating performance of the Company\u2019s core mining business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Furthermore, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, changes in the fair value of financial instruments, and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses are not necessarily reflective of the underlying operating results for the periods presented. Adjusted earnings per share (\u201cAdjusted EPS\u201d) is Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Inventory write-ups to fair value that was sold or processed2 1 Other operating costs relate to the in-pit crusher relocation project and care and maintenance costs due to the June 2024 labour strike. 2 Inventory write-ups to net realizable value that was sold or processed relates to stockpile inventories that were written-up to fair value as part of the acquisition of control of Gibraltar. These write-ups have been included in Adjusted net (loss) income in the period when the inventories were sold or processed.\n\nLoss on settlement of debt, net of capitalized interest Gain on acquisition of control of Gibraltar2 Inventory write-ups to fair value that was sold or processed4 1 Other operating costs relate to the in-pit crusher relocation project and care and maintenance costs due to the June 2024 labour strike. 2 Gain on acquisition of control of Gibraltar relates to the write-up of copper concentrate inventory to fair value for Taseko\u2019s 87.5% interest in Gibraltar at March 25, 2024. 3 Realized gain on sale of inventory relates to copper concentrate inventory held at March 25, 2024 that was written-up to fair value as part of the acquisition of control of Gibraltar, and subsequently sold. The realized portion of these gains have been added back to Adjusted net income in the period the inventory was sold. 4 Inventory write-ups to fair value that was sold or processed relates to stockpile inventories that were written-up to fair value as part of the acquisition of control of Gibraltar. These write-ups have been included in Adjusted net income in the period the inventories were sold or processed. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d) is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company\u2019s performance and ability to service debt. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry, many of which present adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Issuers of \u201chigh yield\u201d securities also present adjusted EBITDA because investors, analysts and rating agencies considering it useful in measuring the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also eliminates the impact of a number of transactions that are not considered indicative of ongoing operating performance. Certain items of expense are added back and certain items of income are deducted from net income that are not likely to recur or are not indicative of the Company\u2019s underlying operating results for the reporting periods presented or for future operating performance and consist of:\n\u2022 Gain on acquisition of control of Gibraltar;\n\u2022 Inventory write-ups to net realizable value that was sold or processed; and Inventory write-ups to fair value that was sold or processed1 1 Inventory write-ups to fair value that was sold or processed relates to stockpile inventories that were written-up to fair value as part of the acquisition of control of Gibraltar.

  "summary": "Taseko has reported its second quarter financial and operational results, with Gibraltar completing the refurbishment and restarting its solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) plant, which had been idle since 2015 and produced 395 thousand pounds of copper cathode. Capitalized stripping costs remained higher at $30.8 million due to a higher than normal strip ratio for sulphide ore tons in the Connector pit. Total site costs including capitalized stripping increased to $116.8m, higher than the prior quarter due to higher mining rates and mill downtime in 2024 due to labour strike and crusher relocation project. Molybdenum production was 180 thousand pounds in the second quarter, comparable to 185 thousand pounds the previous year. The Company expects copper production for the year to be 110 to 120 million pounds, including cathode production, and expects molybondum production to increase in the future. The company also has offtake agreements in place for substantially all of Gibraltar\u2019s copper concentrate production in 2025 and 2026. Construction costs for Florence Copper Project have been incurred at US$33.0m and US239239m as of June 2025. Over 900,000 project hours have been worked with no reportable injuries or environmental incidents. The firm has all the key permits in place and construction continues to progress on schedule.",

      "text": "IMF warns of rising risks in Canada's financial system despite bank resilience\nRising household debt, mortgage renewals and gaps in oversight could expose vulnerabilities in the years ahead, report says\nCanada\u2019s financial system remains broadly resilient despite mounting economic uncertainty, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in its latest assessment \u2014 but warned that rising household debt, mortgage renewals and gaps in cyber and pension oversight could expose vulnerabilities in the years ahead.\nIn its 2025 Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA), the IMF said Canada\u2019s big banks, insurers and pension funds are well-capitalized and capable of withstanding major economic shocks.\nHowever, the report flagged growing risks tied to a wave of upcoming mortgage renewals, high household debt levels and a lack of coordination among financial regulators \u2014 including the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), the Bank of Canada and provincial authorities \u2014 in responding to systemic threats such as cyberattacks, housing market shocks and climate-related disruptions.\nFor the banking and financial sector, the report said \u201ctotal assets of financial institutions reached 756 per cent of GDP in 2024, increasing by 43.3 per cent since 2019.\u201d Non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) have become a dominant force in the sector, now accounting for 65 per cent of total assets.\nSince the last IMF review in 2019, the NBFI sector has expanded significantly, with investment fund assets growing from $2.6 trillion in 2020 to $3 trillion in 2023 \u2014 roughly 110 per cent of GDP. Canada\u2019s insurance market ranked ninth globally in terms of written premiums, according to the report.\nPension funds continue to play an outsized role, holding $2.2 trillion in assets in 2023, or about 75 per cent of GDP \u2014 one of the largest pension sectors in the G7.\nThe IMF notes that while NBFIs remained resilient, data gaps and inconsistent oversight remain concerns, particularly for large pension plans. The sector has grown in size and importance since the 2019 assessment but regulatory coordination has not kept pace.\n- Cuts to Canada's growth 'stand out' in latest IMF economic outlook\n- Canada set to be fastest growing economy in G7 in 2025, IMF forecasts\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nThe report said the banking sector\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is 13 per cent. The CET1 ratio measures a bank\u2019s core capital relative to its risk-weighted assets, indicating its ability to absorb losses. A higher ratio signals strong financial health and compliance with global regulatory standards.\nA 13 per cent CET1 ratio indicates that Canadian banks are well-capitalized \u2014 significantly above the international regulatory minimum of 4.5 per cent, and even above the commonly recommended levels of around 10\u201311 per cent. This gives them a strong buffer to absorb losses in times of economic stress.\nThe report raised concerns about the real estate market in Canada. \u201cAs of December 2024, approximately 60 per cent of mortgages will renew by 2026 at likely higher rates, which could increase payment burdens and delinquencies if economic conditions deteriorate,\u201d it said.\nCanada has the highest household debt-to-GDP ratio among G7 countries, a key vulnerability flagged by the IMF. While it reflects strong credit access and homeownership, it also leaves households \u2014 and the broader economy \u2014 more exposed to rising interest rates, job losses or housing market downturns.\nOn the positive side, the report noted Canada\u2019s mortgage delinquency rate stood at just 0.2 per cent in December 2024 \u2014 well below historical norms \u2014 suggesting most homeowners still managed to keep up with their payments despite rising rates in the last cycle.\nUnder the IMF\u2019s 2025 adverse scenario, mortgage default rates are projected to rise to 0.9 per cent for uninsured loans and 1.4 per cent for insured loans, while corporate defaults could climb from 0.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent by 2027 \u2014 posing sharper risks than anticipated in 2019.\nThe report also warned that broader geoeconomic tensions \u2014 global conflict, shifting trade policies, reduced labour mobility and weak financial systems \u2014 posed a high risk to Canada\u2019s economic outlook.\nOther emerging threats include cyber-attacks, climate change and a potential housing market correction. The IMF flags cyber risks as high, noting they could disrupt payment systems and undermine financial institutions\u2019 ability to function.\nClimate-related disasters, such as wildfires and floods, carry medium-level risk, potentially triggering credit and liquidity stress. A sharp decline in home prices could drive up loan-to-value ratios, raise unemployment and curb household spending and investor confidence.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "\u2018We've got concerns\u2019: Steel import restrictions spark fear of shortages in Western Canada\nMoves to shore up domestic steel mills risk creating price spikes and shortfalls that could reverberate through the economy\nTim McMenamin spent last week holding his breath: a vessel from the Philippines, carrying thousands of tonnes of steel rebar, was scheduled to land in the Port of Vancouver, and he didn\u2019t know if he was going to owe millions of dollars in duties when it did.\nSince the U.S. trade war began, the federal government has repeatedly introduced new restrictions on steel imports \u2014 adding new risks for importers such as McMenamin, who is president of Jebsen & Jessen Hamburg GmbH.\nThe curbs on steel imports are designed to help Canada\u2019s steel mills sell more products inside the country, and also to offset the losses they have suffered since the United States raised tariffs on foreign steel to 50 per cent earlier this year, which has essentially closed off their largest market.\nBut by Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s own estimates, given at a July press conference, foreign-made steel accounts for two-thirds of all steel used in Canada \u2014 \u201ca disproportionately high\u201d amount compared to other countries, he said. Now, as Carney tries to shore up domestic steel mills, he runs the risk of creating price spikes and even steel shortages that could reverberate through the economy as importers pull back in the face of new policies that could saddle them with high duties.\n\u201cOur customers are calling every week asking for our offers,\u201d said McMenamin. \u201cAnd we say we can\u2019t because the government\u2019s contemplating new trade measures, and we don\u2019t know the rules.\u201d\nThe situation cuts to the heart of a major policy dilemma that Carney must navigate: By restricting steel imports, he risks damaging the economy in parts of Canada that have historically relied on foreign steel for use in everything from new residential towers to bridges and other infrastructure projects.\nNot all steel is the same. There is rebar, the long steel rods that help prop up residential condo towers. There are also wide flange beams used in bridges and other projects. There are lampposts, and rails for trains and many other products \u2014 not all of which are produced or can be produced by Canada\u2019s few remaining steel mills and fabricators.\n- Carney says Canada to curb steel imports to protect industry\n- Alcoa CEO says Trump tariffs force a pause for Canada growth projects\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nAlthough Ottawa has taken a flexible approach, and continues to modify the steel restrictions, there is already concern that the latest wave of policies are too restrictive, particularly in Western Canada.\nRavi Kahlon, British Columbia\u2019s minister of jobs and economic development, said his province imports about $4 billion worth of steel every year and he is concerned about shortages.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got concerns,\u201d Kahlon said. \u201cAnd we are having conversations with the federal government just to say, \u2018We understand where you want to go. We understand why. But there has to be ways for us to get there without hurting ourselves along the way.\u2019\u201d\nB.C. and Western Canada may be at more risk than Eastern Canada, including Ontario and Quebec where there are more steel mills.\nThe challenge of matching steel demand to steel supply is that no one knows exactly how much steel is in the country: Construction companies typically bid on projects years in advance and keep inventory in lots. Some companies may also have stockpiled inventory at the first signs of the trade war.\nBut a lobbying group for the domestic steel production industry \u2014 which would be the biggest beneficiary of a reduction in foreign imports \u2014 continue to push for more restrictions, and so far Carney has gradually moved in their direction.\nIn June, for example, the federal government announced \u201ctariff rate quotas\u201d that limit countries that do not have a free trade agreement with Canada to importing no more steel than they imported last year.\nThen in mid-July, he announced a tightening of those policies. Non-free trade countries are now limited to importing half of the volume they imported in 2024 and free trade countries can only import the volume they sent to Canada in 2024. Any steel in excess of that quota triggers a 50 per cent tariff.\nCatherine Cobden, president of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, said the industry was hoping that non-free trade countries would be limited to 20 per cent of what they sent to Canada in 2024.\n\u201cWe are relieved to see some help,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a step in the right direction, but it won\u2019t close the losses.\u201d\nCobden said that Canada\u2019s market is way too open: She noted that Carney said the U.S. relies on foreign steel for less than one third of its demand and foreign steel supplies one-sixth of the European Union\u2019s demand, whereas in Canada that ratio is closer to two-thirds.\nEven many countries that signed free trade agreements with Canada have dumped steel here \u2014 a technical term for selling it below the cost of production, or less than what it sells for in their home market, Cobden added.\n\u201cThe world has a significant overcapacity in steel production,\u201d she said. \u201cMetal flows all over the world, and if it ends up in Canada, that\u2019s the problem we need to address.\u201d\nStill there is the issue of Canadian geography. While Cobden said the country\u2019s domestic mills are capable of shipping products to Western Canada, builders and others in British Columbia and elsewhere say in practice it is often prohibitively expensive to ship steel by rail across the country.\nAs a result, British Columbia has repeatedly requested that Carney carve out their province from steel import restrictions because of the harmful effect it could have on its economy.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re not convinced at this point that we have the (domestic steel) capacity to meet the demand we have,\u201d Kahlon said.\nMeanwhile, McMenamin and other steel importers say they understand why Ottawa would impose restrictions on certain types of steel, such as flat-rolled steel, which is primarily what domestic steel mills produce for the U.S. market.\nBut he and others argue that the measures announced in mid-July and formalized in a customs notice on Aug. 1 are actually more restrictive than anticipated because there are multiple layers.\nFor example, steel rebar had been subject to import quotas within the broader category of what is known as \u201clong steel\u201d products, but the new order creates a specific quota for rebar. It also says that no country can account for more than 29 per cent of the import quota.\nMcMenamin said his order from the Philippines contained 28,800 tonnes of steel rebar. But under the federal policy, no more than 33,613 tonnes of rebar can be imported per quarter from all non-free trade countries, of which the Philippines is only one of many. In addition, no more than 29 per cent of that can come from a single country, which amounts to about 9,700 tonnes.\nThat meant that while the ship was in transit, the federal government adjusted its policy such that he might have faced a 50 per cent tariff on about 19,000 tonnes, which he estimated would have added around $7 million to the total cost, if he did not already have an existing import licence for the shipment.\n\u201cWe would have (had) no choice but to increase the price in the market,\u201d he said, adding that who would ultimately foot the bill would be a messy dispute between importers, distributors and developers.\nIn the end, the ship landed and cleared customs without having to pay the new duty, but McMenamin said he has paused making any new import deals because there\u2019s too much uncertainty about how federal restrictions will evolve.\nMcMenamin said the current federal policy was \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cpunitive,\u201d and predicted that as steel prices rise, housing projects will be delayed, perhaps even cancelled.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the big pain is \u2014 when projects get cancelled,\u201d he said.\n\u2022 Email: gfriedman@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Berkshire shares tumble as Warren Buffett prepares to step down\nConglomerate's stock underperforms market by second widest margin since 1990\nShares of Warren Buffett\u2018s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. have underperformed the wider market by one of the biggest margins in decades, as his retirement as chief executive nears and some investors head for the exits.\nBerkshire\u2019s class A shares have tumbled 14 per cent since May 2, the last trading day before 94-year-old Buffett said he would hand control of Berkshire to top executive Greg Abel.\nBerkshire\u2019s slide contrasts with a rally in the S&P 500 of 11 per cent, including dividends.\nBuffett is in the home stretch of a six-decade tour de force atop Berkshire, transforming a struggling textile mill into a financial conglomerate spanning sectors from insurance to natural gas pipelines. His returns, built on a buy-and-hold, value-driven strategy since he took over Berkshire in 1965, have outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 by more than five million percentage points.\nThat has created what CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert described as the \u201cBuffett premium\u201d on Berkshire shares \u2014 but one that may not immediately pass to his successor.\nThe lag to the S&P 500 is among the largest Berkshire has suffered over any three-month period stretching back to 1990, according to an analysis by the Financial Times. The company only trailed the index more on a three-month basis early in the pandemic, when investors slashed their equity positions, with insurers and financial services companies \u2014 core Berkshire holdings \u2014 particularly hard hit.\nIt is not yet known who has been selling class A shares, Berkshire\u2019s original high-vote stock, which in May changed hands at a record US$812,855 apiece. The A shares have long been held by families who invested with Buffett earlier in his career, and passed down through generations. Quarterly reports from large institutional investors and hedge funds will not be disclosed until later this month.\nThe selling over the past three months has materialized even as Berkshire continued to report healthy operating results across its businesses, with the BNSF railroad, its handful of utilities and manufacturing, service and retailing divisions all reporting profit growth in the second quarter.\n- Can Bill Ackman create a 'modern-day' Berkshire Hathaway?\n- Warren Buffett's Canadian successor is a billionaire without many Berkshire shares\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nOperating profits across the company were hit by currency moves, but excluding those shifts, Berkshire generated an eight per cent rise in earnings from a year earlier.\nBerkshire did not respond to a request for comment.\nBuffett\u2019s investment horizon stretches over decades, and Berkshire shareholders said a three-month window was not a fair measure of the company\u2019s performance.\nBerkshire shares had also surged in the months leading up to this year\u2019s annual meeting in May, rising 18.9 per cent. Investors bought as markets whipsawed on United States President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war, turning to Berkshire as a haven.\n\u201cAs the worries about tariffs started to build\u2026there were people rotating into the safety of Berkshire,\u201d said Bill Stone, the chief investment officer of Berkshire investor Glenview Trust.\nThe Monday following Buffett\u2019s May announcement, shares fell nearly five per cent.\nStone, who likened Berkshire\u2019s US$344 billion cash and Treasury investment pile to Fort Knox, said investors have jumped back into fast-growing technology stocks in the ensuing months, as investor fears over a recession moderated.\n\u201cWhat is really moving in this market is technology, and we know that\u2019s not really his thing,\u201d he added.\nThe rally in Berkshire shares earlier this year also pushed its valuation to heights it has rarely achieved since the global financial crisis. Berkshire\u2019s price-to-book ratio, a measure of how its market capitalization compares to the value of its net assets, climbed to almost 1.8 times, its highest level since October 2008.\nBuffett, who oversees the company\u2019s share repurchase program, stopped buying back Berkshire shares in May 2024. He repurchases stock when he \u201cbelieves that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value,\u201d according to company filings.\n\u201cThe stock was overvalued,\u201d said Christopher Bloomstran, the president of Berkshire shareholder Semper Augustus Investments. Bloomstran added that he believed the recent pullback might entice Buffett to start buying again soon.\nBuffett has also been taking chips off the table. Last year he sold a large portion of the company\u2019s investment in iPhone maker Apple Inc., and Berkshire has now been a net seller of stocks for 11 consecutive quarters, pushing its cash levels to 30 per cent of total assets at the end of June.\nIn other periods of market exuberance, notably the dotcom bubble in 1999, Buffett sat on the sidelines. While that generated opprobrium from critics at the time, with Berkshire shares lagging the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite, the ensuing correction underscored his investment bona fides.\n\u00a9 2025 The Financial Times Ltd\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

In response, developers built more, and supply boomed, eroding the price premium on suburban condos, said the report.\nSince Canada\u2019s housing market peaked in mid-2022, the performance of multifamily housing markets and that of single-family homes has diverged sharply, said Moody\u2019s.\nBoth markets plunged when mortgage rates began to rise, but after bottoming out a year later, the single-family home market has made steady gains, while the multi-family market has suffered further declines.\nBy the first quarter of 2025, condo sales in the Toronto area had dropped 75 per cent from their peak in mid-2022, said Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation in a separate report.\nMonths of inventory for pre-construction condominiums here hit a record high, 14 times higher than in 2022.\n- Why Canada's job market might be too good to be true\n- Canadian businesses cautiously optimistic as they absorb tariff challenges\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nMoody\u2019s said the outlook in the short run depends on how well the condo market can absorb the new inventory. Pre-construction sales were driven by low interest rates, but as these are reset at a higher rate, distressed borrowers could be forced to sell, putting more pressure on prices.\n\u201cWith a wave of new supply poised to hit the market and interest rates remaining elevated, the downward trend in condo prices is likely to endure,\u201d said LaCerda.\nSign up here to get Posthaste delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe almighty American consumer seems to be taking a breather, and tariff price hikes may be to blame.\nAfter shrinking in May, U.S. real personal spending rose just 0.1 per cent in June, said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist with BMO Capital Markets.\n\u201cServices spending was soft, but the real standout was a 0.5 per cent drop in durables even after a previous large decline,\u201d he said.\nDurable goods have been hit by new duties, and as BMO\u2019s chart shows, prices have climbed 3.2 per cent annualized over the past five months, the biggest increase in nearly three years.\nHousehold appliances spiked 16 per cent, computing equipment 14 per cent and home furnishings 5 per cent.\n\u201cFurther price increases are expected, which could depress consumption in the second half of the year,\u201d said Guatieri.\n- The voting period for unionized Air Canada flight attendants on a strike mandate ends today.\n- Greater Vancouver realtors are expected to release July housing data today, followed by the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board Wednesday.\n- Today\u2019s Data: Canada International merchandise trade, United States trade balance\n- Earnings: Suncor Energy Inc., Pfizer Inc., Great-West Lifeco Inc., Pet Valu Holdings Ltd., Molson Coors Beverage Co.\nIt\u2019s mid-summer, and the markets \u2014 and the business world \u2014 just get weirder and weirder.

And while it was the first new pipeline to the west coast in 70 years, it was finished six years behind schedule.\nStill, economists like St-Arnaud and the University of Calgary\u2019s Trevor Tombe have argued it was worth every penny.\nTrans Mountain has increased Canadian oil shipments to refineries in the United States and more than tripled the share of exports to countries abroad, including China. This expanded market access has allowed Canadian oil producers to fetch higher prices.\nThe country\u2019s heavy oil trades at a discount partly because the costs of refining it are higher. In recent years, the discount against North American prices expanded even more because there weren\u2019t enough pipelines, leading to an oversupply.\n- Ottawa may not want to get out of the pipeline business just yet: Trans Mountain CEO\n- 'Northern Leg' to Trans Mountain pipeline attracts interest amid brewing trade war\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nThe Trans Mountain expansion, which nearly tripled the pipeline\u2019s capacity, has helped to ease that pressure and shave the discount to levels that are well below historical norms. As a result, the Alberta Central report suggests the pipeline boosted overall oilpatch revenues by $12.6 billion, an estimate that does not account for increased production made possible by the expansion.\nThe lift in prices is also expected to boost tax and royalty windfalls for the federal and provincial governments. Alberta could bring in $5.4 billion in additional funds, which would account for almost seven per cent of the province\u2019s revenues for the 2024-25 fiscal year, according to the report.\nWhile the Trudeau government approved the pipeline project, the Liberals had also ushered in a spate of new policies that expanded environmental regulations and were widely seen in Alberta and Saskatchewan as hostile to the energy sector.\nThe Carney government is promising a change in tone with an agenda that favours oil and gas development. The prime minister has said a new oil export pipeline is \u201chighly likely\u201d to make a list of so-called nation-building projects that would receive much faster approvals from the federal government.\nStill, any new pipe may not bring the same kinds of financial benefits as Trans Mountain. A theoretical project \u2014 no private-sector proponent has come forward with a proposal \u2014 would not likely lead to even higher prices, according to the Alberta Central report. Instead, it would prevent Canadian prices from falling as companies produce more oil.\nAlready, there are signs that the country\u2019s pipeline capacity may not be keeping pace with a rise in crude production. The energy analytics firm RBN Energy said in a recent note that the oilpatch could face bottlenecks within the next three years.\n\u201cThings only get harder from here, because we don\u2019t have additional pipeline capacity coming on now, and the pipeline capacity that we do have, we\u2019re only going to keep filling it,\u201d said Rory Johnston, publisher of oil market research report Commodity Context.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to run into pricing pressure earlier than you\u2019d think.\u201d\n\u2022 Email: rsouthwick@postmedia.com\nWith files from Meghan Potkins\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.
