  "description": "Ted Scott addressed his absence in an Instagram post on Sunday.",
  "content": "Ted Scott, Scottie Scheffler\u2019s caddie, took some time Sunday to address his recent absence from the FedEx Cup playoffs.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Scott told his followers that he briefly stepped away from golf due to a family emergency. With Scott back home in Louisiana, Brad Payne stepped in as Scheffler\u2019s caddie.\n\n\u201cMany of you know that I left the St. Jude Classic early and didn\u2019t caddie on Sunday. Why? Because we had a devastating family emergency,\u201d Scott said in a video recorded at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta. \u201cProbably the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever walked through in my entire life.\u201d\n\nScott added that he has started to find peace through the situation after receiving support from others in the golfing community. According to the PGA Tour, Scott\u2019s nephew, Joel, is currently recovering from an injury.\n\nWhile no other details have emerged on the injury, golfers and caddies honored Joel during Sunday\u2019s final round at the Tour Championship. Competitors were seen wearing neon yellow ribbons throughout the round.\n\nScott has been a key part of Scheffler\u2019s success throughout his dominant golfing career. Scheffler closed out the Tour Championship at 14-under to secure another top-five finish.\n\nFind more golf coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.",

      "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Tommy Fleetwood of England ended a summer of heartache with the richest prize on the PGA Tour, winning the Tour Championship on Sunday for his first tour title to capture the FedEx Cup and its $10 million reward.\nFleetwood got plenty of help at the start when Patrick Cantlay began bogey-double bogey and could never catch up. Scottie Scheffler hit his opening tee shot out of bounds and still was a threat until a tee shot into the water ended his hopes on the 15th.\nThrough it all, Fleetwood held his nerve. He closed with a 2-under 68 for a three-shot victory over Cantlay (71) and Russell Henley (69).\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a PGA Tour winner for a long time, it\u2019s just always been in my mind,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cA lot of close calls, but I\u2019ve always enjoyed the challenge.\u201d\nHis first PGA Tour victory came with two trophies \u2014 the FedEx Cup and the \u201cCalamity Jane\u201d replica putter for the Tour Championship.\nRyder Cup captain Keegan Bradley was within one shot of the lead on the front nine but wound up with a 70 to tie for seventh. He said he was \u201cdead tired,\u201d and now has to decide whether to use one of his six captain\u2019s picks on himself. He announces his picks Wednesday.\n\u201cThe only thing I care about is on Sunday of the Ryder Cup, that we win the Ryder Cup. Then I\u2019ll know I made the right decision,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil then, I won\u2019t know. It\u2019s going to be pretty wild.\u201d\nBut this day, this moment, belonged to Fleetwood, enormously popular around the world for coping with so many close calls with a refreshing perspective and joy for those who beat him.\nAn eight-time winner around the world, no stranger to big stages at the Ryder Cup or his silver medal at the Olympics last summer, Fleetwood was constantly reminded about his failure to win on golf\u2019s strongest circuit.\nHe saw a one-shot lead turn into a one-shot loss at the Travelers when he took three putts from the front of the green and Bradley made birdie. Fleetwood let a two-shot lead with three holes left get away from him at the FedEx St. Jude Championship to start the postseason.\nFor all the hurt, he never lost hope.\n\u201cTomorrow might be my time, it might not,\u201d he said Saturday evening before his third try going into the final round with no one in front him. \u201cBut I\u2019ll still have a great time doing it.\u201d\nIt was his time, and he had a blast.\nThousands of fans surrounded the 18th green at East Lake to watch the 34-year-old from England, all of them chanting, \u201cTommy! Tommy! Tommy!\u201d Justin Rose, who rallied past him to win two weeks ago, and Shane Lowry stuck around to share in his big moment.\nFleetwood removed his cap when he tapped in for par, looked to the cloudy sky and let those long locks flow as he let out a yell.\nFinally, Fleetwood.\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the most comfortable I\u2019ve been,\u201d Fleetwood said with a smile. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had a great attitude throughout it all. ... I\u2019m so happy I got it done.\u201d\nHe started the final round tied for the lead with Cantlay, the FedEx Cup champion from 2021 searching for his first win in three years. Cantlay made bogey on the first, three-putted for double bogey on the second and suddenly was four behind.\nCantlay never went away, however, and a two-shot swing on the 10th \u2014 Fleetwood made bogey from the left rough, Cantlay made a 5-foot birdie \u2014 narrowed the gap to one shot. The next three holes were pivotal.\nCantlay failed to get on the green from a bunker on the par-3 11th and made bogey. Fleetwood birdied the next two holes with wedges to the 6-foot range, and Cantlay could only match one of them.\nThe last big hurdle was the 218-yard 15th to a peninsula green, where Fleetwood went in the water Saturday and made double bogey. This time he managed a bogey and didn\u2019t miss a step the rest of the way in finishing at 18-under 262.\nCantlay was two back with three to play when he missed the 16th fairway and made bogey.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have a chance on Sunday and to be right there. I\u2019ve been there plenty of times, and any time you get in that spot, it\u2019s a real pleasure,\u201d he said.\nHenley went 13 straight holes without a birdie and couldn\u2019t put any serious pressure on him.\nScheffler\u2019s start was even more shocking. His tee shot went left and disappeared under a fence, out-of-bounds. Then, he got up-and-down from 201 yards to salvage a bogey. He ran off three birdies in four holes to finish the turn, making a 40-foot birdie putt on the par-3 ninth.\nBut he missed a 5-foot birdie on the 10th, and his hopes ended with a 5-iron that went into the water on the 15th for double bogey. He closed with a 68.\nThere\u2019s no doubting the best this year. Scheffler won five times, including two majors. He finished the season with 21 consecutive rounds in the 60s, and he has gone five straight months finishing no worse than fifth. He was trying to become the first back-to-back FedEx Cup champion.\n\u201cI battled all week to give myself a chance. I wasn\u2019t as sharp as I would have hoped to have,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI had a good first round, but outside of that didn\u2019t really play my best the first few days. Still gave myself a shot. Just needed a few better swings.\u201d\nCameron Young also lingered for much of the final round and shot 66 to tie for fourth with Scheffler and Corey Conners (62), strengthening his bid to make his first Ryder Cup team before home fans in New York.\nYoung won, and two top 5s in the FedEx Cup playoffs and tied for 11th in the last month."

      "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Russell Henley hardly missed a putt. Scottie Scheffler hardly missed a fairway. They led a parade of players who seized on the soft conditions at East Lake to begin the race for the Tour Championship and the season-ending FedEx Cup title.\nHenley one-putted six of his last seven holes and made three birdie putts from 40 feet or longer and, with three straight birdies at the end, had a 9-under 61 to build a two-shot lead over the world\u2019s No. 1 player.\nScheffler didn\u2019t miss a beat from last week \u2014 really the last five months \u2014 and finished with a 25-foot par save on the 16th and two birdies for a 63. That\u2019s his lowest round by two shots in his six appearances at East Lake.\nThe entertainment came from Rory McIlroy, who bladed a bunker shot on the par-5 18th hole over the green and off the grandstands, and then back onto the green. He made an 18-foot putt for a most unlikely birdie.\nScheffler was rooting hard for McIlroy, not so much for the birdie but so they could avoid a length ruling to finish. Seconds after Scheffler holed his 4-foot birdie putt, the horn sounded to stop play because of approaching storms that led to East Lake being evacuated.\nLeft behind was a leaderboard filled with red numbers in a tournament that has a $40 million purse in official money for the top 30 players, all of them with an equal chance. Only two players were over par.\nRain hammered East Lake on Wednesday \u2014 and again after the first round ended \u2014 leaving the course soft enough that players could lift, clean and place their golf balls in the short grass.\n\u201cI felt like with it being lift, clean and place and somewhat soft compared to last year when the greens were brand new, it was a little bit softer, so it was just a little bit more gettable,\u201d Henley said.\nThere was also that no-so-small matter of putting. Henley already has a great reputation with the putter, and on this day he holed some 207 feet worth of putts.\n\u201cProbably the most I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d he said.\nThree of the five players who got in at 64 was enough to wonder which cup was on their minds. Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa and Patrick Cantlay all finished outside the top six who qualified for the Ryder Cup and have to wait on being one of six captain\u2019s picks.\nAll three are seen as likely picks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever comfortable until you get that call and you\u2019re on the team,\u201d Morikawa said. \u201cLook, I hope I\u2019ve done enough. We\u2019ll have to wait and see. But I think, yeah, my focus right now is to try and go out and win this golf tournament. I think if I do that, then hopefully that\u2019s enough, and we\u2019ll see how everything plays out.\u201d\nScheffler is coming off his fifth victory of the season last week at the BMW Championship and didn\u2019t miss a step. All that slowed him was some swirling wind as the storm approached, making it a little tougher to get close for birdie chances with a wedge in hand.\nThe only fairway he missed \u2014 except for No. 18, in which the ball rolled through the middle into the first cut \u2014 was at the 16th, and that left him in his biggest predicament. From the rough he went down a deep swale to the right, the one place he knew to avoid.\n\u201cI knew going down there right of 16 was a huge penalty. We had talked about it in the practice rounds,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd our job was just to get the ball back on the green, which I did, and it was nice to hole that long putt.\nBut it was a reminder of how key it was to keep the ball in play.\n\u201cI missed one (fairway) on 16 and all of a sudden I\u2019m almost playing for bogey,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty important around this place.\u201d\nTexas Tech product Ludvig Aberg was inside the top 10 after a first round 4-under 66. Tommy Fleetwood, who keeps giving himself chances at his first win on the PGA Tour, also was at 66, along with BMW Championship runner-up Robert MacIntyre, who is ready for a return to Scotland given how hot has been in Memphis, Baltimore and Atlanta.\n\u201cI wear as much sun cream as I possibly can. I look like Casper the Ghost out there, to be honest. I get a lot of shouts about my sun cream,\u201d MacIntyre said.\nIt beats the shouts he got last week at Caves Valley when he lost a four-shot lead to Scheffler in the final round and was hearing from the pro-American crowd along the way. MacIntyre was as upset about how he handled the crowd as he was his golf, but figures it will be a great teaching moment for him at Bethpage Black for the Ryder Cup next month.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a couple of things that I know that I\u2019m going to change, but do you know what it\u2019s really going to help me for? Bethpage,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always going to be fiery, I\u2019m always going to yell, swear, yell, get angry.\n\u201cBut just the way I interacted with the crowd, I was trying to keep them out of the way, but instead of doing what I did on Saturday and bringing them into it.\u201d"

      "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 One swing cost Tommy Fleetwood the lead Saturday in the Tour Championship. Another great closing stretch gave Patrick Cantlay a shot at the ideal ending to three years without winning.\nCantlay birdied four of the last five holes on a rain-soaked course at East Lake for a 6-under 64 and a share of the lead with Fleetwood, who rebounded from his double bogey on the par-3 15th hole with a pair of birdies for a 67.\nAnd still the most compelling name of all is Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley, who has until Wednesday to decide if he should pick himself for the U.S. team and made a compelling case with a 63 that left him very much in the mix.\nBradley is consumed with the Ryder Cup, and it didn\u2019t help that when he registered for the Tour Championship, he saw the Ryder Cup bag of Arnold Palmer from the 1963 matches at East Lake. He was the last playing captain in the Ryder Cup.\n\u201cIt was really weird looking at it,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cLike really strange. Because I\u2019m nowhere in the world of Arnold Palmer and somehow I\u2019m in this with him right now.\u201d\nThrow in Russell Henley and Scottie Scheffler, and Sunday is shaping up as a thriller to conclude the PGA Tour season with more than one cup in the conversation.\nIn a FedEx Cup finale in which no one started with an edge in points or shots, it comes down to those five players separated by four shots, with Cameron Young (71) six behind.\nFleetwood ran off four straight birdies on the front nine, and he appeared to be in control after a wedge into 6 feet for birdie on the 13th. Then came the 15th, 220 yards to a peninsula green. From a shorter tee, only one tee shot went into the water each of the first two rounds.\nFleetwood was the 10th player to hit into the water Saturday, a 6-iron he knew was wet when it left his club. Even so, the congenial Englishman didn\u2019t let that ruin his round, answered with a pitching wedge from the bunker to 12 feet for birdie on the 16th.\nHe failed to birdie the par-5 18th, leaving him in a tie with Cantlay at 16-under 194.\nCantlay won the FedEx Cup in 2021. He hasn\u2019t won since the BMW Championship in 2022, though he never looks too far off his game. One change was working with putting guru Phil Kenyon two weeks ago on his setup, and perhaps that\u2019s the spark.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to close the way I did, especially the last two days,\u201d Cantlay said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with where I\u2019m at.\u201d\nCantlay might have assured his spot at Bethpage Black. Even at 15th in the Ryder Cup standings, he was seen as a logical choice given how he performed under pressure in Rome and at the Presidents Cup last year in Montreal.\nNow he has a chance to win the FedEx Cup for the second time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have your game shape up at the end of the year, but like I said, I\u2019m focused 100% on this week, and we\u2019ll worry about the Ryder Cup a little later,\u201d he said.\nFor Fleetwood, it\u2019s another shot at his first PGA Tour title after gut-punching losses at the Travelers Championship and the FedEx St. Jude Championship two weeks ago. All he wanted was another chance, and this is another great one.\nHenley went quiet on the back nine until a birdie on the final hole for a 69, leaving him two shots behind.\nScheffler was so frustrated with putts he felt he slightly misread that he tossed his putter at his bag after missing an 8-foot birdie try on the 16th. He had missed two other birdie chances from slightly closer. He still shot 66, his 20th consecutive round under par.\nScottie Scheffler birdies No. 7 to move to -8 and T3 @TOURChamp\n\u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) August 22, 2025\n\ud83d\udcfa Golf Channel pic.twitter.com/sjkhMezfIG\n\u201cFelt like another frustrating day,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI felt like I did some things well out there. I was just a little bit off on my reads most of the day. I hit some good putts that just didn\u2019t fall. Overall, I didn\u2019t shoot myself out of the tournament, which making bogeys around this place can very easily do that.\n\u201cProud of the turnaround,\u201d he said. \u201cBut man, I wish I could have gotten a little bit more out of the round.\u201d\nSunday is for the FedEx Cup and the $10 million prize, a chance for Scheffler to become the first repeat FedEx Cup champion, for Fleetwood to finally get that first PGA Tour title, for Bradley to make it virtually impossible not to pick himself.\nHe already has two wins in the last 13 months, as many as any American this side of Scheffler.\n\u201cI\u2019m either going to win or I\u2019m not and we\u2019re going to know the picks,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident with the picks that we have. One more day of golf to kind of finalize this whole thing, and I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m done with this whole process. I want it over with either way.\u201d"

      "text": "ATLANTA \u2014 Tommy Fleetwood is a familiar story hopeful of a different ending, posting eight birdies in his round of 7-under 63 to share the lead Friday at the Tour Championship with Russell Henley in what was shaping up as a tight race for the $10 million prize.\nFleetwood, increasingly popular for his grace in handling so many tough losses, is searching for his first PGA Tour win to go along with a collection of strong European tour titles. But he has been down this road before, quite often this year. The questions are getting old.\nMaybe it ends with the Englishman winning two trophies for his first win \u2014 the FedEx Cup and the \u201cCalamity Jane\u201d replica putter that serves as the Tour Championship trophy.\n\u201cAll I can do is keep learning,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cI actually feel like I\u2019ve played very, very well when I have led the tournaments and been in contention. It\u2019s just I might have not got things right right at the end. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve crashed and burned. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve not quite finished things off. The people that win the most are the guys that are in contention the most.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I want to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep going. I love the buzz when I am in contention, and I\u2019m just excited for the opportunity again.\u201d\nThe only buzz he got wrong was the setting on his clippers when he went to trim his beard, prompting questions about whether he shaved. It beats the alternative question of when he will win or whether this will be the week.\nBut it won\u2019t be easy. Russell Henley had another birdie-birdie finish for a 66 to join him in a share of the lead at 13-under 127, extraordinarily low scoring except for spells of heavy rain the previous two days at East Lake and more expected Friday \u2014 they moved the tee times forward to avoid a stoppage in play. Greens are soft, they run true and preferred lies are in place.\nIt\u2019s a recipe for low scoring and that\u2019s what the Tour Championship has provided. Add to that the new format where the top 30 players start at even, instead of the top seed getting a two-shot lead and the bottom five players starting 10 shots behind.\nCameron Young bolstered his Ryder Cup hopes with a 62, which included a par save from the 17th fairway when he wisely pitched out from a most awkward lie. He was two shots behind.\nPatrick Cantlay, the FedEx Cup champion from 2021, was on the verge of taking himself out of the tournament until he shot 30 on the back nine, capped off by a birdie-birdie-eagle finish, the last one a 7-wood from 249 yards to 6 feet. He shot 66 and was three behind, along with BMW Championship runner-up Robert MacIntyre.\nScottie Scheffler hit a wedge to a foot on the final hole for a 69, not his cleanest round but extending his streak of 19 consecutive rounds under par. He was five back.\n\u201cJust one of those days where it seemed like I wasn\u2019t getting rewarded for the stuff that I was doing,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cJust a touch off all day.\u201d\nHenley opened the round by holing out from a bunker for birdie, and he played the slope on the green from the bunker on the 18th for a closing birdie.\nThe course is playing to an average score of 67 through two rounds.\nLudvig Aberg, the Texas Tech product, is tied for 14th, seven shots off the lead.\n\u201cWhen conditions are soft and there\u2019s been rain, I think that leads to a bunched leaderboard, so no surprise there,\u201d Cantlay said. \u201cThese 30 guys have played well all year, so not a surprise to see them playing well here this week.\u201d\nThat\u2019s especially true for Fleetwood. He was gutted when he took a one-shot lead into the final hole at the Travelers Championship, only to take three putts from 50 feet from short of the green and lose by one shot to a Keegan Bradley birdie.\nTwo weeks ago in Memphis, he was two ahead with three to play when he played one chip too firm, failed to get up-and-down on the 17th and wound up one shot out of a playoff.\nThere is still plenty of work ahead, with 13 players at 7-under 133 or lower.\n\u201cI know this weekend scoring is obviously going to be very good,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cThe scoring is really good, but the course actually isn\u2019t easy. You\u2019ve got to play well. I know that I need to just go out for the next 36 holes \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m not even thinking about 36, I\u2019ve got to start tomorrow first \u2014 keep committing to my golf shots, keep hitting them, and hopefully play well.\n\u201cBut the more you\u2019re there, the more you are comfortable in those situations and comfortable in that scenario. I\u2019m just really excited to go again.\u201d"

      "text": "After dominating much of the season, Scottie Scheffler just narrowly missed out on a second consecutive FedEx Cup victory this weekend.\nThe Highland Park product tied for fourth in the Tour Championship, finishing four shots behind winner Tommy Fleetwood. As the result set in, golf fans on social media shared their thoughts on the FedEx Cup\u2019s format and whether the right golfer came away with a title win.\nHere\u2019s a look at the nation\u2019s reaction to Scheffler\u2019s Tour Championship finish:\nScottie Scheffler going into the final tournament with twice as many points as 2nd place and won\u2019t win the tour championship is the dumbest thing ever.\n\u2014 Zahn Brooks (@ZahnBrooks) August 24, 2025\nLet's see:\n\u2014 Brad Townsend (@townbrad) August 24, 2025\n1. Entering this week Scottie Scheffler had more than twice as many FedEx Cup points as 2nd place Rory McIlroy.\n2. Scheffler just tied for 4th in the Tour Championship. He won 5 times this season, including the PGA Championship and British Open. He made 19 of 19\u2026\nScottie Scheffler, world No. 1, made some of the wildest worst swings today I've ever seen a Tour player make. Yet: he has such extraordinary hand-eye feel and touch that he still shot 68, will tie for 4th in the Championship and still has a chance to challenge Tiger's career.\n\u2014 Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) August 24, 2025\nOn the bright side Scottie Scheffler is a four-time back to back to back to back Player of the Year on the PGA Tour if you want some positive\n\u2014 TrackingScheffler (@SchefflerLegion) August 24, 2025\n\"Consolation prize:\"\n\u2014 Brad Townsend (@townbrad) August 24, 2025\nWith the $2.6M he earned today by tying for fourth, Dallas' Scottie Scheffler inches closer to joining the PGA Tour's extremely exclusive career $100M earnings club:\n1. Tiger Woods $120,999,166\n2. Rory McIlroy $107,586,766\n3. Scottie Scheffler $98,373,136\nHow is Scottie Scheffler not the FedEx Cup Champion\u2026.. they messed up with this new format \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u2642\ufe0f\n\u2014 Ian McGarvey (@Just4kicks26) August 24, 2025\nThe #FedEx cup is basically a 4 day horse race. Don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s season long. So stupid. Scottie has dominated the entire year and damn near pulled it off this weekend for another Top 5 finish. @PGATOUR\n\u2014 Bret Hoovler (@BretHoovler) August 24, 2025\nI like Tommy Fleetwood but the FedEx Cup means less than nothing when a guy with zero wins is about to claim it over a guy with five wins and two majors. So desperate to make it exciting that you succeeded in making it a title of zero significance except for $$$. Nice job, guys.\n\u2014 Super 70s Sports (@Super70sSports) August 24, 2025\nAbsolute poetry. Tommy Fleetwood's long-awaited maiden PGA Tour win comes in the year the Tour Championship reverts to a normal 72-hole stroke play format and his first PGA Tour win makes him the FedEx Cup champion. Just awesome\n\u2014 Evin Priest (@EvinPriest) August 24, 2025\nScottie Scheffler's T4 finish at the Tour Championship moves him past Phil Mickelson and into third place on the PGA Tour's official career earnings list with $98,373,136. https://t.co/nHFHkRoAGF\n\u2014 David Rumsey (@_DavidRumsey) August 24, 2025\nTour Championship results\n\u2014 Jamie Kennedy (@jamierkennedy) August 24, 2025\n(with the old starting strokes format)\n-24 Scheffler\n-23 Fleetwood\n-19 Henley\n-17 Cantlay\n-17 Young\n-16 Conners\n-16 Thomas\n-16 Griffin\nThis new FedEx cup final format sucks!!! What\u2019s the point of finishing high up on the rankings if you don\u2019t win it!\n\u2014 Bill Ranson, PGA (@BillRansonGolf) August 24, 2025\nThe format should be a match play and have the top 36 players get into the finals and seed it based on points won. @PGATOUR #FedExCup\nCongrats to Fleetwood, but finally winning your first tour tourney should not make you the FedEx Cup champion. He was nowhere near close in points to Scheffler. Absolutely ridiculous format - change it or get rid of it. Give it to the player of the year-the one who won 6+ times.\n\u2014 torgman (@jttorg) August 24, 2025"

Scott returned for the TOUR Championship this week. The Scott family has requested prayers for Joel at this time.\nScottie Scheffler and caddie Ted Scott are seen wearing yellow ribbons during the final round of the 2025 TOUR Championship. (Tracy Wilcox/PGA TOUR)\nThe ribbons were visible on the hats of much of the field on Sunday at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta.\nScott and Scheffler began the final round at 12-under, four strokes back of 54-hole leaders Tommy Fleetwood and Patrick Cantlay. With a victory at the TOUR Championship, Scheffler would become the first player to win the FedExCup back-to-back, after capturing golf's ultimate prize in 2024."
