      "title": "Trump Revokes Biden’s Competition Executive Order",
      "summary": "Donald Trump has revoked President Biden's 2021 Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy, which critics argue expanded government control rather than fostering true competition. The Biden order established a Competition Council and aimed to regulate various sectors, but was seen as a means to centralize authority rather than promote free market principles. Trump's new directive emphasizes deregulation and aims to eliminate more regulations than are introduced, while concerns remain about potential future regulatory overreach from both parties.",
