  "description": "ARM or x86? Let's find out.",
  "content": "Most Windows computers use x86 processors from Intel or AMD, but some models also use ARM-based processors. That hardware comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, so it\u2019s important to know what architecture is being used. Here\u2019s how you can do it.\n\nBefore getting started, it\u2019s worth pointing out ARM PCs are not the same as Copilot+ PCs. The first wave of Copilot+ PCs all used ARM-based Snapdragon chipsets, but since then, many models with Intel and AMD x86 processors have been released. Some Copilot+ PCs are also ARM PCs, but not all of them, and not all ARM PCs are necessarily Copilot+ PCs.\n\nThere are a few ways to check if a PC has ARM hardware and Windows 11 on ARM before you buy it. You can look for \u201cSnapdragon\u201d in the product name or specifications, which is the brand Qualcomm is using for all its ARM-based PC chipsets.\n\nFor example, the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x uses Windows 11 on ARM. You can tell because it has \u201cSnapdragon\u201d in the product name, and \u201cSnapdragon X Elite\u201d is listed as the processor. MediaTek is also supposed to enter the Windows PC market at some point, so that would be another brand that indicates an ARM chipset.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking at the box for a computer in a store, or a display unit, you can also check for a \u201cSnapdragon\u201d sticker. It\u2019s usually somewhere on the box, or in the lower corner of the bottom lid when the laptop is opened. That\u2019s another indicator that the PC uses an ARM processor.\n\nThe features list and specifications for some ARM-based Windows computers will also say \u201cWindows 11 on ARM,\u201d or some variation of that. Lenovo was kind enough to include \u201cWindows 11 Home 64 ARM\u201d as the operating system on that Yoga laptop\u2019s product listing, but not all stores and manufacturers are upfront about that detail.\n\nYou can check the Settings app in Windows to check if a PC has an ARM processor or not. Press the Windows key and X key at the same time, then select \u2018System\u2019 in the popup menu. You can also search for the Settings app, then navigate to System > About.\n\nThe About page lists some of the computer\u2019s specifications. If you see \u201cARM-based processor\u201d under \u201cSystem type,\u201d then you have an ARM Windows PC. Other PCs usually say \u201cx64-based processor.\u201d\n\nYou can also use the Windows Terminal or PowerShell to check the current CPU architecture. First, open the Start menu, search for Terminal or \u201cWindows PowerShell\u201d (it doesn\u2019t matter which one), and open it. Type this command, then press Enter/Return:\n\nThis will return \u201cARM64\u201d if the current PC is using ARM hardware, or possibly \u201cARM\u201d if the PC has an older 32-bit ARM processor. Other types of computers will display values like \u201cx64\u201d (for 64-bit x86), \u201cx86\u201d (for 32-bit x86), or other values.\n\nYou can also run the gwmi command to display more information about the your CPU, including the exact model and clock speed:\n\nThere are a few other system tools and commands that show similar information, but those are more than enough for checking if the current PC has an ARM chip or not.\n\nWindows computers with Snapdragon chipsets or other ARM hardware, or Apple Silicon-based Macs running Windows in a virtual machine, have to use Windows 11 on ARM. That version looks the same as regular Windows, but it has to run many applications and games through an x86 emulation compatibility layer, because Windows software designed for ARM is still somewhat rare. That compatibility layer can make some software run slowly, or cause them to break entirely.\n\nThe good news is that the list of ARM-native applications is slowly expanding. Most web browsers are built for ARM now, in addition to popular apps like Zoom, VLC Media Player, Signal, Slack, Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, Microsoft Office, Affinity Photo, LibreOffice, and Google Drive. Some other apps and games are still broken, though, like most (but not all) games using anti-cheat technology.\n\nIf you need the absolute best compatibility with games and applications, you should probably stay away from ARM Windows PCs for the moment. With these steps, you can quickly identify if a PC is using ARM hardware, and make an informed decision about which tradeoffs you\u2019re willing to accept.",

      "text": "MediaTek executives reiterated their plans to eventually enter the PC market with an Arm processor, challenging Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon in the Windows on Arm market. Unfortunately, the details of its plans are still skimpy.\nAt an executive summit hosted by the company, MediaTek executives said that they see a $40 billion opportunity for the PC market, which the company will address with a version of its Kompanio mobile processor. MediaTek, which claims to be the fourth-largest fabless company in the world, also plans to build in 5G radios for connectivity, Bluetooth, WiFi, and display ICs for the notebook.\nCorporate vice president Vince Hu said that MediaTek planned to move from the \u201clow-power space to the high-power space,\u201d taking some of the Arm technology it has applied to smartphone chips like its Dimensity processor line and applying it to PCs. He referred to a \u201crecognition that we have to support higher-performance applications.\u201d\n\u201cIn CPU and GPU we are having to make some bigger investments as a foundational capability,\u201d Hu added.\nThat seems to imply that MediaTek will design any improved CPUs and GPUs in house, rather than acquire or work with external third parties. That would be a different approach than Qualcomm, which has marketed several generations of Arm chips for laptops, but whose performance has struggled to keep up with X86 chips from AMD and Arm. Qualcomm acquired Nuvia as a source of Arm design talent to improve its capabilities, but is currently involved in a lawsuit with Arm, which has argued that Qualcomm\u2019s existing licensing terms to do not include the Nuvia designs.\nMediaTek\u2019s plans to attack the PC market stem from its current position on Chromebooks \u2014 which, according to company executives, include a position as the top Arm chip supplier to that Chromebook market. MediaTek on Thursday launched the new Kompanio 520 and 528, entry-level chipsets for Chromebooks.\nMediaTek\u2019s attack on the PC will be led by Adam King, the vice president and general manager of client computing for MediaTek. King spent six years planning Intel\u2019s client platforms, and four more as director of notebook product marketing overseeing the 4th-gen through 6th-gen mobile Core chips.\nUnfortunately, King stayed mum as well. \u201cWe absolutely believe in the long term potential of Windows on ARM,\u201d King said. \u201cWe think that the market will over the long term transition to ARM based processors. Because of the power and area efficiency that I described. It\u2019s not inevitable \u2014 it requires lots of work and lots of barriers to be overcome. But the benefit is clearly there. I can say that we\u2019re working on plans today. I just can\u2019t share them with you yet.\u201d\nMediaTek executives first tipped their plans to enter the PC market last year, though without any details. The company had previously said that it would skip the Windows 10 generation of the PC market, describing it as a limited opportunity."

      "text": "The Copilot+ PC is a new category of Windows computers, spanning across laptops, desktops, and tablets. Here\u2019s how they work, and how they\u2019re different than a typical PC.\nWhat Is a Copilot+ PC?\nMicrosoft introduced the Copilot+ PC category in March 2024, announcing the computers as \u201cthe fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built.\u201d The main distinction is that every Copilot+ PC has a dedicated neural processing unit, or NPU, which can run local machine learning or generative artificial intelligence workloads without eating up CPU or GPU resources.\nCopilot+ PCs have additional Windows system features powered by the NPU. Live Captions, which can add real-time captions to any video content (including calls), has an additional real-time translation mode on Copilot+ PCs. Paint and other Windows applications have a \u2018Cocreator\u2019 feature for generating AI images as well.\nCopilot+ PCs also have Windows Studio Effects, which allow you to apply effects to your camera and microphone like a background blur, portrait light, automatic video framing, and voice isolation. Some video chat services have built-in versions of these features, but the Windows Studio Effects run locally on your own PC, so they should work better and be more responsive. They\u2019re a lot like the video effects and Center Stage feature available on most Mac computers.\nThe most controversial feature on Copilot+ PCs is Recall, which creates a searchable and scrollable timeline of your PC\u2019s screen activity by periodically capturing screenshots. For example, if you forgot what you were working on a few hours ago, you can jump back a few hours and see a snapshot from that time. Windows also scans the text and context of each snapshot to make them searchable. You could enter \u201cNew York City\u201d to quickly jump to a WhatsApp chat where you were talking about a trip, or it can find articles about NYC you were reading in your web browser a few days ago.\nRecall is a bit like Spotlight on macOS and the now-defunct Timeline feature from Windows 10, but the way it works is completely different. Instead of applications filling out a database of your activity (like Timeline), or your computer scanning your local files and connected cloud documents (like Spotlight), Recall scans what\u2019s on your screen and uses on-device AI models to figure out the context.\nMicrosoft delayed the rollout of Recall after the initial version was found to have many security issues. The database of screenshots was readable by third-party applications, Recall was seemingly enabled by default, and it gave anyone with physical access to the computer a full timeline of everything you did on the PC. Microsoft went back to the drawing board, promising the database would be encrypted, accessing Recall would require authentication with Windows Hello, and Recall wouldn\u2019t be enabled by default. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if Microsoft sticks to those promises\u2014as of February 2024, Recall is still limited to the public testing branches of Windows 11.\nThe NPU can also be used by third-party applications. Qualcomm announced last year that Affinity Photo 2 can use the NPU on Snapdragon laptops for better object selection, and the Moises audio editor can do real-time instrument and voice isolation. These integrations are still rare, though, and may not work the same across Snapdragon and x86-based PCs.\nCopilot+ PCs are also supposed to have a dedicated Copilot key for opening the Copilot chatbot. However, if you buy a tablet or desktop PC without a built-in keyboard, you might not have one. Also, some PCs might have the Copilot key but aren\u2019t Copilot+ PCs. That\u2019s not confusing at all.\nYou can always check Microsoft\u2019s website for an updated and complete list of all features unique to Copilot+ PCs.\nCopilot+ PCs vs. ARM PCs\nThe first Copilot+ PCs were laptops with Qualcomm\u2019s ARM-based Snapdragon X chipsets, so reviews and impressions about Windows 11 for ARM and the performance of Snapdragon chips was mixed in with discussions about Copilot+ PCs. However, they are not the same thing. Some ARM Windows PCs are Copilot+ PCs, but not all Copilot+ PCs have ARM processors.\nYou can now buy Copilot+ PCs with Intel and AMD x86 processors, in addition to many models using ARM-based Snapdragon chips. Qualcomm was just the first company that had chipsets with high-performance TPUs. Now that Intel and AMD have caught up, you can get a Copilot+ PC without the software compatibility issues on ARM Windows 11.\nWhy Are Some PCs Not a Copilot+ PC?\nThe main requirement for a computer to be a Copilot+ PC is having an NPU capable of performing 40 or more TOPS (40 trillion operations per second), according to Microsoft\u2019s documentation. That includes PCs with many Snapdragon X chipsets, some Intel Core Ultra (Lunar Lake) processors, AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI Max chips, and others.\nImportantly, that requirement is based on the TOPS performance of the processor or system-on-a-chip. Dedicated graphics cards can add more performance, but they won\u2019t turn an old PC into a Copilot+ PC with all features available. Presumably, Microsoft wants to avoid eating up GPU resources for background tasks that are constantly running, and that\u2019s only possibly by offloading the processes to a dedicated TPU. Maybe there will be some official way of enabling Copilot+ features on older PCs with hardware upgrades, but nothing has been announced about that yet. Microsoft would prefer if you bought a new computer.\nEach Copilot+ PC is also required to have at 16GB of DDR5/LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of SSD storage. The base requirements for Windows 11 is 4GB RAM and 64GB of solid state or hard drive storage, so the benchmark for Copilot+ PCs is a bit higher. In this respect, the Copilot+ PC label is a bit like the Intel Evo Platform or Google\u2019s Chromebook Plus label\u2014it\u2019s telling you \u201cthis computer will be at least okay.\u201d"

      "text": "Summary\n- Windows on Arm is a modified version of Windows that runs on computers with Arm processors.\n- Most Windows applications are primarily compiled for x86 processors, so running them on Arm Windows requires emulation, resulting in slower performance.\n- Arm Windows PCs with Qualcomm chips are not as impressive in terms of performance compared to traditional x86 PCs, and app compatibility remains an issue.\nWindows PCs with Arm chips are slowly gaining traction, promising better battery life and cellular connectivity, and Microsoft has a special version of Windows just for those computers. Windows on Arm might look and feel exactly like regular Windows 11, but there are some catches.\nWindows on Arm: What Is It?\nWindows on Arm is a modified version of Microsoft Windows that runs on computers with Arm processors, instead of the x86-based processors (mostly from Intel and AMD) that use regular Microsoft Windows. It works best with software built specifically for Arm chips, but it can run many 32-bit and 64-bit x86 applications in emulation at slower speeds.\nWindows on Arm dates back to 2012, when Windows RT arrived alongside the original Microsoft Surface tablet. Windows RT was a modified version of Windows 8 for Arm PCs, but it didn't have a backwards compatibility layer, so it could only run software rebuilt for Arm. Most applications didn't do that, since the Surface tablet and other Windows RT devices didn't sell well.\nMicrosoft later revealed Windows 10 on Arm in 2017, which took some lessons from the failure of Windows RT. It was based on the then-new Windows 10 instead of Windows 8, and Microsoft had a closer partnership with Arm chipset manufacturer Qualcomm. Unlike Windows RT, the initial version could run some x86 applications and games in emulation, so the lack of software was less of a problem. Microsoft started testing 64-bit x86 emulation in 2020, allowing 64-bit Arm PCs to run even more non-Arm software. That functionality eventually arrived in 2021, but only for Arm PCs updated to Windows 11.\nWindows on Arm can also run as a virtual machine on some other Arm-based computers. For example, if you set up Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion, UTM, or another virtualization application on a Mac with an Apple Silicon chip, you'll use Windows on Arm.\nHow to Check if a PC Has Arm Windows\nYou can check if you are running Windows on Arm through the Windows Settings application. First, open the Settings application by searching for it in the Start menu, or by right-clicking on the Start button and selecting the \"Settings\" menu item. Then select the \"System\" menu and click \"About\".\nThe Device Specifications section in the Settings page will tell you what kind of computer you have. If you see \"Arm-based Processor,\" your PC is running Windows on Arm.\nYou can also check from the System Information panel in Windows. Type the shortcut Win + R (or right-click the Start button and choose \"Run\"), then type msinfo32 in the text field and click OK. This will open the System Information application.\nThe main System Summary page will show what type of computer you have. If it says \"Arm64-based PC\" or something else with \"Arm,\" you have Windows on Arm.\nWindows on x86 vs. Windows on Arm\nWindows on Arm works about the same as the regular x86 edition of Windows. It has the same interface, the same File Explorer, the same system applications, and most of the same features. If you sat down in front of an Arm Windows PC, and you didn't know it had different hardware under the hood, you probably wouldn't be able to tell a difference.\nThe benefits and disadvantages of Windows on Atm are more about the specific chip being used in the computer. Most Windows on Arm PCs are low or mid-range laptops, with Qualcomm chips that are slower than the mainstream laptop processors from Intel and AMD. As a result, Windows on Arm might feel slower if you're used to a higher-end PC, but that's not necessarily the operating system's fault. Most Arm Windows devices also have cellular connectivity, while most x86 Windows PCs do not, so LTE and 5G support is usually a selling point for Arm on Windows.\nThe main difference with Windows on Arm is software compatibility. Most Windows applications and games are primarily compiled for x86 processors, not Arm processors. Windows has a built-in compatibility layer that translates x86 instructions to Arm instructions, but it's not perfect\u2014more on that in the next section. There's also some Windows software that can't run through the compatibility layer, like hardware drivers.\nDo X86 Applications Work in Windows on Arm?\nWindows 11 on Arm has a built-in compatibility layer for running 32-bit and 64-bit x86 Windows applications. In most cases, you can just double-click on an application like normal (or select it in the Start Menu) and it will run as you would expect. However, it's not a perfect solution, especially compared to Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon Mac computers.\nFirst, x86 emulation is slow, so non-native software will run worse on Arm Windows than they would on regular x86 Windows PCs. This isn't a big deal for simple applications or old games, but it's especially noticable in CPU-heavy software, like Electron applications, the Steam launcher, and modern PC games. The compatibility layer also can't work for hardware drivers or low-level system components. For example, most anti-cheat solutions in PC games won't work\u2014Fallout 76, VRChat, and many other games fail for that reason. Hardware drivers and applications that rely on File Explorer extensions also won't work unless they add Arm support. For example, Dropbox wouldn't run on Arm Windows at all until Arm support was added in 2023, because it hooks into the File Manager to handle file sync.\nSecond, the compatibility layer has a few different emulation settings, which you might need to manually change if an application doesn't work. You can change the settings by right-clicking on an executable file, selecting \"Properties,\" and opening the Compatibility tab. If the application is in your Start Menu, you'll have to select \"Open File Location\" on it first, which will reveal its location in the File Explorer.\nThe Compatibility tab in Windows on Arm has a \"Change emulation settings\" button that reveals some additional options. You can try switching to \"Strict Emulation\" or \"Very Strict Emulation\" if an application doesn't work, though performance will be affected. I've also found that older applications and games sometimes work better if you check the \"Run this program in compatibility mode for\" box and select Windows 7 or Windows 8.\nEven with those limitations, the compatibility layer is impressive. I've played a lot of Civilization VI, Fallout 3, Civilization V, and SimCity 2000 in Arm Windows on my MacBook Air, all of which are 32-bit or 64-bit x86 software.\nUnfortunately, there's not an easy way to check if a given application or game will work on Arm Windows. If software has an official Arm version, it should be listed in the official system requirements, or the download page will have an Arm Windows version. However, some other software may still be able to run in the compatibility layer without official support.\nShould you get an Arm PC with Windows?\nEven though Windows on Arm is much more impressive today than it was a few years ago, it's still at a software disadvantage compared to traditional Windows. Most applications and nearly all games are not Arm-native, so they will run in a slower compatibility layer, if they work at all. That tradeoff might be worth it if you absolutely need built-in 5G connectivity, which is common in Qualcomm-based Arm Windows laptops and not x86-based Windows laptops, but that's about it.\nThe current batch of Arm Windows PCs with Qualcomm chips also aren't that impressive in the performance department. A mid-range laptop with an Intel or AMD processor will likely perform better and not leave you guessing about application compatibility. The first laptops with Snapdragon X Elite chips are expected to arrive sometime in 2024, which should be a significant performance improvement, but app compatibility will remain an issue for at least the next few years. Google Chrome finally added native Arm Windows support, at least."

Users can identify ARM PCs by looking for \u201cSnapdragon\u201d in the model name, checking the Windows Settings \u201cAbout\u201d page for an ARM\u2011based processor, or running PowerShell commands that return \u201cARM64.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s new Copilot+ PCs, which may use ARM or x86 chips, feature a dedicated neural processing unit for AI workloads and additional system features like Recall and Studio Effects, but they require high\u2011performance NPUs and at least 16\u202fGB of RAM. Despite growing support for ARM\u2011native software, compatibility remains limited, and performance on current ARM laptops lags behind comparable Intel and AMD models, making them best suited for users who need built\u2011in 5G or other ARM\u2011specific features.",
