  "content": "131% Growth Over Three Years Highlights Sustained Industry Leadership Since 2009\n\nMIAMI, FL / ACCESS Newswire / August 12, 2025 / Erase.com, a trusted leader in online reputation management, has been named to the 2025 Inc. 5000 list of America's fastest-growing private companies, ranking No. 3,085 with an impressive 131% revenue growth from 2021 to 2024.\n\nThis recognition marks another milestone in the company's long history of industry leadership. Under its previous brand, Guaranteed Removals, the company was ranked No. 46 on Canadian Business and Maclean's 2019 Startup 50 list of Canada's Top New Growth Companies, celebrating a 370% two-year growth rate and positioning it among the fastest-growing startups in the country.\n\nThe company was also named one of Canada's Top B2B Companies by Clutch in 2021 for its proven expertise and client satisfaction. In addition, Erase.com has been recognized as a Great Place to Work\u00ae for four consecutive years (2021-2024), underscoring its commitment to employee well-being, workplace culture, and long-term team growth. Together, these honors highlight a sustained pattern of high performance, innovation, and trust from both clients and employees.\n\nNow operating as Erase and headquartered in Miami, the company has expanded its reach and scale to become one of the highest-revenue players in the online reputation management industry.\n\n\"Making the Inc. 5000 is not just about growth,\" said Cenk Uzunkaya, CEO of Erase.com. \"It's about sustained results, operational excellence, and client trust built over 15 years. We've proven we can grow through changing markets, shifting algorithms, global disruptions and still deliver for our clients.\"\n\nFounded in 2009, Erase specializes in the permanent removal of harmful online content and negative reviews from major platforms. The company serves businesses, public figures, and individuals worldwide, helping them protect their names, brands, and livelihoods.\n\nErase.com's place on the 2025 Inc. 5000 reflects sustained, high-revenue growth built over more than 15 years, a rare accomplishment in the fast-paced marketing and PR sector of online reputation management, where lasting scale is far less common than short-term spikes.\n\nInc.'s 2025 list celebrates companies that have achieved extraordinary growth despite economic uncertainty and evolving business landscapes. Erase.com's inclusion underscores its ability to remain a high-revenue leader in one of the most competitive and rapidly changing industries.",
