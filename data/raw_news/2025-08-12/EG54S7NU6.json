  "title": "Sam Altman, OpenAI will reportedly back a startup that takes on Musk\u2019s Neuralink",
  "description": "Neuralink has been making serious progress. Soon Sam Altman and OpenAI could be backing a challenger.",
  "content": "Sam Altman is in the process of co-founding a new brain-to-computer interface startup called Merge Labs, and raising funds for it with the capital expected to largely come from OpenAI\u2019s ventures team, unnamed sources told the Financial Times.\n\nThe startup is expected to be valued at $850 million. Merge Labs is also reportedly working with Alex Blania, who runs Tools for Humanity (formerly World) \u2014 Altman\u2019s eye-scanning digital ID project that \u201callows anyone to verify their humanness,\u201d as the company describes.\n\nMerge Labs will compete with Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink, which is developing computer interface chips designed to be implanted in the brain. Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 (although its existence wasn\u2019t known until 2017) and the company has made serious progress.\n\nNeuralink is currently in trials with people who suffer from severe paralysis. It aims to allow them to control devices with their thoughts. It raised a $600 million Series E at a $9 billion valuation in June.\n\nNeuralink (and perhaps, Merge Labs) could revolutionize how humans interact with technology. Some might even say their tech could take humanity towards \u201cthe singularity.\u201d\n\nLong before Silicon Valley became obsessed with the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI), it was enamored with \u201cthe singularity.\u201d Musk has used the term to describe a time when AI surpasses human intelligence. The more classic definition (after a 1960\u2019s novella of the same name by Dino Buzzati), means the merging of tech with humans.\n\nAltman blogged about \u201cThe Merge\u201d in 2017. \u201cAlthough the merge has already begun, it\u2019s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants,\u201d he postulated at the time citing research work he saw at OpenAI, where Musk was still a co-founder.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018 and the relationship between the two tech leaders has since disintegrated. Just this week, Altman and Musk were bickering on X after Altman accused Musk of manipulating X and Musk called Altman a liar.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see when and if Merge Labs becomes formally announced. But it stands to reason that Altman wasn\u2019t going to let Musk work on something as important as the singularity without a challenger.\n\nOpenAI could not be immediately reached for comment and declined to comment on FT\u2019s report.",

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

      "text": "A popular topic in Silicon Valley is talking about what year humans and machines will merge (or, if not, what year humans will get surpassed by rapidly improving AI or a genetically enhanced species). Most guesses seem to be between 2025 and 2075.\nPeople used to call this the singularity; now it feels uncomfortable and real enough that many seem to avoid naming it at all.\nPerhaps another reason people stopped using the word \u201csingularity\u201d is that it implies a single moment in time, and it now looks like the merge is going to be a gradual process. And gradual processes are hard to notice.\nI believe the merge has already started, and we are a few years in. Our phones control us and tell us what to do when; social media feeds determine how we feel; search engines decide what we think.\nThe algorithms that make all this happen are no longer understood by any one person. They optimize for what their creators tell them to optimize for, but in ways that no human could figure out \u2014 they are what today seems like sophisticated AI, and tomorrow will seem like child\u2019s play. And they\u2019re extremely effective \u2014 at least speaking for myself, I have a very hard time resisting what the algorithms want me to do. Until I made a real effort to combat it, I found myself getting extremely addicted to the internet. [1]\nWe are already in the phase of co-evolution \u2014 the AIs affect, effect, and infect us, and then we improve the AI. We build more computing power and run the AI on it, and it figures out how to build even better chips.\nThis probably cannot be stopped. As we have learned, scientific advancement eventually happens if the laws of physics do not prevent it.\nMore important than that, unless we destroy ourselves first, superhuman AI is going to happen, genetic enhancement is going to happen, and brain-machine interfaces are going to happen. It is a failure of human imagination and human arrogance to assume that we will never build things smarter than ourselves.\nOur self-worth is so based on our intelligence that we believe it must be singular and not slightly higher than all the other animals on a continuum. Perhaps the AI will feel the same way and note that differences between us and bonobos are barely worth discussing.\nThe merge can take a lot of forms: We could plug electrodes into our brains, or we could all just become really close friends with a chatbot. But I think a merge is probably our best-case scenario. If two different species both want the same thing and only one can have it\u2014in this case, to be the dominant species on the planet and beyond\u2014they are going to have conflict. We should all want one team where all members care about the well-being of everyone else.\nAlthough the merge has already begun, it\u2019s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like.\nIt\u2019s probably going to happen sooner than most people think. Hardware is improving at an exponential rate\u2014the most surprising thing I\u2019ve learned working on OpenAI is just how correlated increasing computing power and AI breakthroughs are\u2014and the number of smart people working on AI is increasing exponentially as well. Double exponential functions get away from you fast.\nIt would be good for the entire world to start taking this a lot more seriously now. Worldwide coordination doesn\u2019t happen quickly, and we need it for this.\n[1] I believe attention hacking is going to be the sugar epidemic of this generation. I can feel the changes in my own life \u2014 I can still wistfully remember when I had an attention span. My friends\u2019 young children don\u2019t even know that\u2019s something they should miss. I am angry and unhappy more often, but I channel it into productive change less often, instead chasing the dual dopamine hits of likes and outrage.\n(Cross-posted from https://medium.com/wordsthatmatter/merge-now-430c6d89d1fe to here for consistency; thanks to Medium for inviting me to write this!)"
