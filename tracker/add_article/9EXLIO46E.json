      "summary": "The hearing over President Trump's attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook concluded without a ruling, leaving the governor’s status unresolved. Analysts warn that a politically driven Fed could erode the central bank’s independence, potentially spurring higher long‑term rates and dampening investment. The outcome may influence short‑term rate expectations, with some Fed officials still calling for cuts, while others caution against the administration’s aggressive rate‑cut agenda. The case underscores the importance of maintaining the Fed’s institutional credibility to preserve the U.S. safe‑harbor premium.",
