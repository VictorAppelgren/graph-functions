  "content": "iOS 26 might be best remembered for its Liquid Glass redesign, but the update will also add two brand new apps to your iPhone\u2019s Home Screen. Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming.\n\nGaming on the iPhone is getting a new central hub in iOS 26.\n\n\u2019Apple Games\u2019 is a brand new app that joins the ranks of other media-focused iPhone apps such as:\n\nThe new Games app includes a Home view where you\u2019ll spend most of your time. Here\u2019s Apple\u2019s description:\n\nJoining Home are tabs for Arcade, Play Together, and Library.\n\u2022 Arcade largely replicates the type of content you\u2019d see inside the App Store\u2019s Arcade tab.\n\u2022 Play Together shows challenges, multiplayer options, and Game Center data from your friends.\n\u2022 Library contains all the games installed on your iPhone, plus your achievements and more.\n\nApple Games is launching not only on iPhone, but also iPad and Mac this fall.\n\nPreview might sound familiar\u2014it\u2019s the name of Apple\u2019s long-time Mac utility for viewing and editing PDFs and images.\n\nIn iOS 26, Preview is coming to the iPhone (and iPad) for the very first time.\n\nPreview offers a dedicated app for viewing PDFs and images saved in iCloud, on your device, or other Files app sources.\n\u2022 Editing PDFs and images with tools like resize, rotate, and more\n\u2022 Creating new images, whether from scratch or the clipboard\n\nJust like the Mac\u2019s Finder launches PDFs and images in the Preview app by default, now your iPhone and iPad\u2019s Files app will launch those document types inside Preview too.\n\nPreview uses the new document browser UI first introduced in iPadOS 18 and seen in other apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. So it won\u2019t look quite like the Mac app does, but the functionality is very similar.\n\nWith Apple Games and Preview, Apple is once again expanding the number of built-in apps on an iPhone.\n\nGames seeks to capitalize on the iPhone already being a popular gaming platform for many, while Preview looks like a valuable added utility. Both apps replicate a lot of functionality previously found elsewhere, but add new features too and seem like natural candidates for new standalone apps.\n\nAre you interested in the new Games or Preview apps in iOS 26? Let us know in the comments.\n\u2022 AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)",

      "text": "Apple has a new Liquid Glass design coming to iOS 26, macOS 26, and every other software platform. And whether you love it, hate it, or are indifferent, Apple\u2019s new design seems like a major win in several key ways.\nSoftware redesigns are risky, but Apple accepted the challenge\nWhenever software gets redesigned, it\u2019s a risky move.\nApple knows that from last year\u2019s big Photos app revamp, which many users were not a fan of.\nBecause of the risks associated with big changes, I wasn\u2019t sure we would ever see the arrival of a new iOS overhaul.\nYet Apple saw fit to tackle not only iOS, but also macOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS with this year\u2019s Liquid Glass redesign.\nTalk about a tall task.\nSomehow though, based on what Apple has shown publicly, I think Liquid Glass could be a huge win for the company and its users.\nWith iOS 26 and its companion releases, Apple has managed to craft a new design that checks four important boxes.\nFour ways iOS 26\u2019s Liquid Glass design succeeds\niOS 26 is still in beta and will no doubt change before its release date. However, just based on what Apple has shown publicly, I\u2019m calling it a win.\nApple\u2019s new Liquid Glass design achieves four things. It\u2019s simultaneously:\n- Fresh and fun, giving Apple\u2019s products a \u2018new\u2019 shine\n- Still very familiar, not too jarring for users\n- Unifying of various products for a better cross-platform experience\n- And it preps for future hardware in the works\nThat\u2019s a lot to pull off with one redesign, but I think Apple\u2019s done it.\nWhether or not Liquid Glass is an objective improvement over prior designs, I\u2019ll leave others to answer. Everyone has their own opinion.\nBut undoubtedly the new design provides a fresh, new look and feel for Apple products that\u2019s nice to have.\nYet at the same time, everything still works similarly to how it did before. There\u2019s little about the new design that requires a fresh learning curve, unlike iOS 18\u2019s Photos app.\nTop comment by avr91\nA lot of what was shown at WW is going to be toned down, and probably quite a bit. A lot of what they showed, if actually delivered would be very off-putting for a system-wide UI. Everybody is loving the animations when they zoom in, but too many of those flares will make it noisy and distracting. It's no surprise that they've already been toning some of them down as they move through betas and feedback. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like their designers looked at much beyond cool factor.\nApple has also unified its various platforms in a big way. Ecosystem has long been a strength for Apple, and with the Liquid Glass design, moving between different products will feel more seamless than ever.\nFinally, this design was no doubt crafted with future hardware in mind, too. What better match for Liquid Glass than a pair of Apple Glasses? Or an iPhone that\u2019s all screen?\nIn one impressive swing, Apple looks to pull off a huge win with its new design. Let\u2019s check back in September to see how the masses really respond.\nWhat are your thoughts on Apple\u2019s new Liquid Glass design in iOS 26? Let us know in the comments.\nBest iPhone accessories\n- AirPods Pro 2 (now only $199, down from $249)\n- MagSafe Car Mount for iPhone\n- HomeKit smart plug 4-pack\n- 10-year AirTag battery case 2-pack\n- 100W USB-C power adapter for fast charging\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
