  "content": "President Trump said declassified documents show \u201cabsolute proof of guilt\u201d that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former FBI Director James Comey conspired to sabotage his 2016 campaign.\n\nThe president called the newly revealed documents \u201cincredible\u201d evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sick people, and they\u2019re criminals, and they should be taken care of,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. But Clapper and Comey and that whole group of criminals. They\u2019re criminals.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThey did the fake Russia, Russia, Russia witch hunt that lasted for two years, and I got totally exonerated. \u2026 It was a whole scheme to try and demean Trump so that I couldn\u2019t win an election.\u201d\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard this week declassified documents showing a Dec. 22, 2016, email exchange between Mr. Clapper and former National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers discussing the \u201cjoint product related to Russian attribution and intent for the DNC/DCCC hacks.\u201d\n\nMr. Clapper was resolute about \u201cstickin\u2019 to\u201d the narrative that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Mr. Trump, despite a former top intelligence official saying otherwise in e-mail exchanges.\n\nIt is the latest trove of declassified documents that has shed new light on how Mr. Clapper and other Obama administration officials manipulated intelligence about Mr. Trump\u2019s links to Moscow.\n\nMr. Clapper said last month that he \u201clawyered up\u201d after Ms. Gabbard made a criminal referral to the Justice Department about the Trump-Russia hoax.\n\nIn the newly declassified documents, Mr. Clapper discussed the Obama administration\u2019s endeavor to overhaul an intelligence community assessment on Russian interference as a \u201cteam sport\u201d and said they may need to \u201ccompromise\u201d their standards, Ms. Gabbard said Wednesday.\n\nMr. Rogers cautioned that his team raised concerns about pushing the report out too fast and their lack of time to review the intelligence and weigh in on the matter.\n\n\u201cI know that this activity is on a fast track and that folks have been working very hard to put together a product that can be provided to the President,\u201d Mr. Rogers wrote in the email. \u201cHowever, I wanted to reach out to you directly to let you know of some concerns I have with what I am hearing from my folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked my team if they had sufficient access to the underlying intelligence and sufficient time to review that intelligence. On both points, my team raised concerns,\u201d Mr. Rogers wrote to Mr. Clapper.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that given the expedited nature of this activity, my folks aren\u2019t fully comfortable saying that they have had enough time to review all of the intelligence to be absolutely confident in their assessments,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I am not saying that we disagree substantively, but I do want to make sure that when we are asked in the future whether we can absolutely stand behind the paper, that we don\u2019t have any reason to hesitate because of the process.\u201d\n\nMr. Clapper pressured the former NSA director, though, to push forward.\n\n\u201cUnderstand your concern. It is essential that we (CIA/NSA/FBI/ODNI) be on the same page, and are all supportive of the report \u2014 in the highest tradition of \u2018that\u2019s OUR story, and we\u2019re stickin\u2019 to it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Clapper wrote back.\n\nHe rejected any talk that any additional time was necessary to review the intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will facilitate as much mutual transparency as possible as we complete the report \u2026 but, more time is not negotiable,\u201d Mr. Clapper said.\n\n\u201cWe may have to compromise on our \u2018normal\u2019 modalities, since we must do this on such a compressed schedule,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThis is one project that has to be a team sport.\u201d\n\nThe e-mail exchange happened within days of a Dec. 9, 2016, meeting between President Obama, Mr. Clapper, CIA Director James Brennan and other top administration officials. At the meeting, Mr. Obama called for a report that described the \u201ctools Moscow used and actions it took to influence the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Times reached out to Mr. Clapper for comment.",

  "summary": "President Trump has accused former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former FBI Director James Comey of creating the \"Trump-Russia hoax\" scandal, claiming they conspired to undermine his 2016 campaign. The president called the newly revealed documents \"incredible\" evidence of wrongdoing. The documents also reveal a Dec. 22, 2016, email exchange between Clapper and ex-NSA Director Mike Rogers discussing the \"joint product related to Russian attribution and intent for the DNC/DCCC hacks\" and that Clapper was adamant about maintaining the narrative that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Mr. Trump. The new documents shed new light on how the Obama administration manipulated intelligence about Mr. Donald Trump's links to Moscow and how the intelligence community was manipulated.",
