  "content": "TV STAR Maya Jama has shown off Man City defender Ruben Dias' glittering trophy room in a behind-the-scenes Instagram upload.\n\nMaya, 30, and Dias, 27, have been dating for months and are always giving their fans little glimpses behind the curtain.\n\nThis time the Love Island presenter showed her 3.2million Instagram followers Dias' impressive collection of awards in a selfie on her story.\n\nMaya posed in front of a wall of accolades that Dias has earned throughout his career, giving fans a reminder of just how good her boyfriend is on the pitch.\n\nTrophies behind the TV personality included replicas of Dias' four Premier Leagues and replicas of the Champions League, Community Shield and FA Cup he has won with City.\n\nMasses of Player of the Match awards, Team of the Season trophies and bottles of champagne also adorned the wall.\n\nWhile Premier League winners medals were also hanging from the display.\n\nLast season was the first year since Dias' \u00a365m move to the Etihad in 2020 that the centre-back hasn't won a trophy with the club.\n\nDias has just returned to training with City after an extended break away from the pitch following the Cityzens' exploits at the Fifa Club World Cup this summer.\n\nHe and Maya enjoyed their time off together, jetting away to Ibiza to rest up and catch some sun.\n\nThe pair appeared loved-up in a picture that showed them enjoying each other's company at an Ibiza beach club.\n\nThe couple also spent some time in Italy, sharing their first ever picture together on a yacht on the Amalfi Coast.\n\nIt's thought that the pair met when they attended the European Music Awards (EMAs) in November.\n\nSince then they have been unable to keep apart and are regularly seen getting cosy with each other.",
