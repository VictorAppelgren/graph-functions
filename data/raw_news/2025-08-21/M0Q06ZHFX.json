  "content": "From childhood road trips to cozy hotel mornings, Comfort Hotels finds waffles aren't just breakfast \u2013 they're pure travel nostalgia. But when it comes to the perfect waffle, vacationers are charmingly divided.\n\nNORTH BETHESDA, Md., Aug. 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In celebration of National Waffle Day, Choice Hotels International (NYSE: CHH), one of the world's largest and most successful lodging franchisors, and its flagship hotel brand, Comfort Hotels, is spotlighting America's love for waffles and the breakfast moments that make vacations unforgettable. A new nationwide survey commissioned by Choice Hotels* reveals that waffles are far more than a morning meal \u2013 they're a cherished symbol of travel, connection, joy and the Comfort brand.\n\nWaffles as the Heart of the Vacation Morning\n\nNearly three in four travelers in the U.S. (74%) say a relaxing breakfast is essential to a great vacation, and 66% rank breakfast among their favorite family travel memories. While only 18% typically sit down for breakfast on a weekday, that number soars to 63% when on vacation \u2013 proof that waffles aren't just food, they're a vacation breakfast staple.\n\nBut this affection runs deeper than just enjoyment. More than three in four respondents (78%) say sharing food is their favorite way to connect with others and 57% associate waffles with cozy, relaxing mornings.\n\nFor decades, Comfort Hotels has been part of these moments with more than 30 million waffles made at its properties annually, each one contributing to a guest's cherished vacation memory. Travelers of all generations know and love the free, hot breakfast, inclusive of waffles and more, they receive while staying at Comfort properties.\n\nThe Great Waffle Debate: Crispy vs. Fluffy and Full-Size vs. Mini\n\nAmerica's love for waffles is undeniable but when it comes to the perfect bite, the nation is split. 41% percent of respondents say crispiness is a make-or-break factor when it comes to the perfect waffle, while the rest prefer a softer, fluffier bite.\n\nFor toppings, tradition reigns supreme with 74% remaining loyal to the classic pairing of butter and syrup.\n\nMini-sized products are trending across brands and industries, but waffles represent one area where Americans aren't willing to compromise contentment for cuteness as 67% prefer full-size waffles.\n\n\"Waffles aren't just something we serve, they're a symbol of Comfort, connection and the joy of travel,\" said Noha Abdalla, Chief Marketing Officer, Choice Hotels International. \"We know breakfast, especially waffles, is part of the emotional foundation of a hotel stay. Whether you're Team Crispy or Team Fluffy, we're proud to deliver the perfect start to the day for all our guests \u2013 one waffle at a time.\"",
