  "title": "5 of the best new Android apps you need to try this September",
  "description": "This month's best Android apps roundup includes a space news app, two brilliant and proven games, and a Google Pixel 10 app.",
  "content": "Keeping up with the latest and greatest apps and games can be difficult, but I\u2019m here to help. Each month, I draft a detailed list of the best new Android apps and games, and the September 2025 edition is here.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing I love more than a well-designed, single-purpose app, and Quasar is the latest example. This app is dedicated to providing the user with news about space, including details about upcoming missions to the cosmos, a dedicated AI platform to answer space-related questions, and direct access to NASA\u2019s Picture of the Day catalogue.\n\nEven if you aren\u2019t a moonwalker, Quasar is beautifully designed. With clean lines, an easy theme switcher, and swift performance, I find it hard to fault. However, the Space Wiki feature \u2014 a search tunnel for space-related Wikipedia pages \u2014 regularly yielded no results for core topics like Mars, Uranus, and the Moon.\n\nNevertheless, Quasar is a great little app for enthusiasts or kids learning about the world beyond their world. I\u2019m excited to see how this app progresses in the future.\n\nMachinarium is a gorgeously grungy and charming adventure puzzler in which you play a robot trying to save his beloved from a gang that kidnapped her. The story isn\u2019t integral to the enjoyment of the title, but the rich world, cute characters, and relatively tricky puzzle mechanics are.\n\nCinematique is a really great app for cinephiles and couch potatoes. It doubles up as a database for shows and movies and a personal catalogue that allows users to keep track of the content they\u2019re watching, want to watch, and probably should watch.\n\nIt includes a robust feature set, including a news breakdown, a personal tracking library, an excellent exploration feature that makes it easy to find new shows and movies, and a handful of AI recommendation smarts (if you\u2019re willing to pay for them).\n\nI haven\u2019t used Cinematique nearly as much as I would want. It only just launched this weekend. However, the app shows plenty of promise and polish.\n\nLaunched on the Pixel 10 series, Google Journal also functions on other Android devices if you\u2019re willing to jump through a few hoops. I think it\u2019s worth it, as the smart diary app offers a great experience if you\u2019re looking to catalog your days.\n\nAgain, when installed on anything other than the Pixel 10, Journal lacks several features, including scant AI insight smarts. Nevertheless, you still get a decent number of pre-determined writing suggestions which I do appreciate.\n\nChants of Sennaar has an \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d rating on Steam, and now, two years after its launch on PC and console, it\u2019s available on Android.\n\nThe adventure puzzle game takes place in a rich, colorful world based on the story of Babel. Your goal, as you play as the Traveler, is to unite the various in-world factions who cannot seem to understand each other.\n\nNaturally, the game is driven by its central narrative, and many of the puzzles hinge on your learned understanding of the various languages and writings in the game. You will encounter some physics challenges here and there, though.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nI installed Google Journal on my Samsung, and you should too\n24 hours ago\nGoogle rolled out many new software features and apps with the Pixel 10, including a new diary app called Journal. While it\u2019s believed to be exclusive to the new phone line, that\u2019s not entirely true. I downloaded the APK and installed it on my Samsung Galaxy phone without much trouble. If you\u2019re looking for a simple, immediate journal app, I suggest you try it on your phone too.\nDo you plan on using Pixel Journal?\nHow to install Google Journal on a non-Pixel phone\nFor many, Google Journal isn\u2019t visible on the Play Store, but it comes preinstalled on Pixel 10 devices. However, it\u2019s not locked to Google devices even if it uses on-device Gemini Nano to unleash its full potential. It can therefore run on phones from other manufacturers. To install it, follow these steps:\n- Before you can install Google Journal, you\u2019ll need a split APK installer. Since we\u2019re grabbing the APK file from APK Mirror, you may as well use APKMirror Installer. Download it from the Play Store at the link.\n- Next, open your web browser. Visit the Google Journal listing on APK Mirror and hit the orange Download APK bundle icon.\n- Now, open APKMirror Installer > Browse files, go to your Download folder, and you\u2019ll find the Journal installation file with a green APKM logo beneath it. Select it, then tap Install package.\n- APKMirror Installer does have ads, unfortunately. So you can either subscribe to remove the ads or Watch ad and install app. I recommend the latter.\n- After the ad completes, a pop-up will appear asking if you want to install Journal. Choose Install.\n- Once the app is installed, tap Open app to get journaling.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nWithout the AI, Google Journal nails the basics\nIf there\u2019s one thing Google Journal does well, it\u2019s the basics. That might not sound positive, but let me explain. Google emphasizes the app\u2019s AI features, but many are limited to the Pixel 10. On other phones, the absence of these features is actually beneficial.\nMy colleague Joe mentioned in a recent opinion that this AI feature, which creates writing prompts based on past entries, activity data, and photos, is why he won\u2019t use the app. This feature uses Gemini Nano on-device and currently only works on the Pixel 10. You don\u2019t have this AI issue on non-Pixel devices.\nUsing Google Journal on a Samsung phone is an AI-free experience.\nSure, Google Journal is as simple as a pigeon nest, but I see this as a positive. While more powerful diary apps have habit-tracking, multi-journals, and universal availability, these features can be overwhelming. Even Notion and Obsidian can feel excessive when I want to jot down a few thoughts. Journal\u2019s simplicity allows me to clear my head and just write.\nOf course, you can use Journal as a journal, but it has other potential uses. It could be a useful travel log, allowing you to include multiple photos and maps in an entry quickly. It could also work as a brain dump tool, a food log, or a more focused project record tool.\nOverall, I think Google did a good job with Journal. It\u2019s a fledgling app, but it looks great in its Material 3 Expressive design and offers pretty much everything I could want in a quick-fire journal app.\nThere are still better options for journaling on Android\nI might like Journal\u2019s simplicity, but you might not. There are more established journaling options on Android if you need more features. For instance, Journal doesn\u2019t have a voice note feature, which seems strange. It also lacks habit tracking, a feature many bullet journal enthusiasts consider essential.\nHere are a few Google Journal alternatives (or useful partners) you might want to check out:\n- Habitica: Gamifying chores and tasks, Habitica encourages users to perform tasks and develop habits. It\u2019s not strictly a journaling app, but complements an app like Journal really well.\n- Daylio: With a colorful interface and a focus on moods, Daylio helps connect daily activities with mental health. Like Journal, you can upload photos, select a mood, and write a brief entry.\n- Journey: Journey is like Journal all grown up, with more organizational features like tagging, a built-in mood tracker, and platform availability beyond Pixel devices.\n- Day One: If you need a collaborative journal shared with family or friends, Day One is a great option. It includes custom writing templates and a clean interface.\n- Notion: Not strictly a journaling app, Notion is highly adaptable and customizable. It offers dedicated journal templates with habit tracking options, or you can build your own.\nIf you don\u2019t own a Pixel 10 phone, I suggest installing Journal. The app works well without its built-in AI features and gets to the core of journaling. This might be my way back into journaling, and I\u2019m excited to see how Google develops and hopefully broadens the app\u2019s availability in the coming years.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro is technically cheaper than the Pixel 10, at least for me\nAugust 31, 2025\nI\u2019m in the market for a new phone, and while I told myself I wouldn\u2019t spend more than $500 on it, I\u2019m a tech nerd and have to say that the latest Pixels look very appealing. I prefer smaller phones, and the entry-level Pixel 10 has all the features I want and need, and then some. I don\u2019t see myself spending an extra $200 on the similarly sized Pro model, as the price difference isn\u2019t worth it for me.\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: The Pixel 10 Pro is actually cheaper for me in the long run. So, if I were to buy one of Google\u2019s new phones, the Pixel 10 Pro makes the most financial sense.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more. Find out more here.\nWait, what?\nYou\u2019re probably thinking this doesn\u2019t make sense, but it does for my personal situation. I\u2019m subscribed to the Google AI Pro plan, which gives me 2TB of cloud storage, access to Gemini 2.5, and a bunch of other benefits. I\u2019ve been on this plan for almost a year because I need the extra space in Drive and use Gemini daily for both work and personal tasks.\nIf I buy the Pixel 10 Pro, I get a yearly subscription to this plan for free. The plan costs $20 per month, which means this included perk is valued at $240. This same perk is not included with the standard Pixel 10, which only comes with a six-month subscription to Google\u2019s One 2TB plan, which doesn\u2019t provide me with the value I need.\nThe price difference between the two phones is $200, and the value of the included yearly plan is $240 if paid on a monthly basis. This means that, technically speaking, I\u2019m better off buying the Pro model when you factor in the cost of the Google AI Pro plan. While the Pixel 10 Pro costs more upfront, I\u2019d actually spend more in the first year with the Pixel 10 since I would have to pay $240 for the subscription.\nTo break it down with numbers, here is a simple comparison of the first-year costs:\n| Pixel 10 | Pixel 10 Pro | |\n|---|---|---|\nUpfront cost | Pixel 10 $799 | Pixel 10 Pro $999 |\nGoogle One AI Pro (yearly subscription) | Pixel 10 +$240 | Pixel 10 Pro +$0 |\nTotal cost (after 1 year) | Pixel 10 $1,039 | Pixel 10 Pro $999 |\nThis means I\u2019m saving $40 over the course of one year while getting a better phone at the same time. The Pro comes with a brighter display, more RAM, and improved cameras compared to the Pixel 10, making it a more suitable option for demanding users.\nSo, should everyone get the Pro?\nWell, not really. This logic only applies to people like me who are already subscribed to the Google AI Pro plan and will keep the subscription active for at least a year. If you don\u2019t have a subscription and didn\u2019t plan on getting one, then this calculation doesn\u2019t apply to you. You\u2019re better off with the Pixel 10 if that\u2019s the one you truly want, as there are no real savings if you buy the Pro and don\u2019t genuinely care about the free subscription. But if you want the Pro just for the extra features you\u2019re getting and don\u2019t care about money, that\u2019s another story.\nI'm still considering the Pixel 9 or the 9a, though.\nFor me, the Pixel 10 Pro makes more sense to buy than the Pixel 10 from a financial standpoint, although I am still looking at something like the Pixel 9 or even the 9a for the savings alone. I could get the Pixel 9 for around $500 in my part of the world at the moment, saving $260 compared to the Pixel 10 Pro when taking the value of Google\u2019s AI Pro plan into account.\nHonestly, the phone has everything I need, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be happy with it. Common sense tells me this is the way to go, but the tech lover in me that likes to play with all the latest features, even though I may not use some of them on a regular basis, is nudging me towards the Pixel 10 Pro.\nWhat do you think I should do? Get the latest Pixel 10 Pro, opt for the Pixel 9 or even the cheaper 9a for the savings, or buy something else completely? Let me know via the poll below and explain your reasoning in the comments. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.\nWhich phone should I buy?\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
