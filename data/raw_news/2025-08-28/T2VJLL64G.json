  "content": "Daniil Medvedev has been fined $42,500 for unsportsmanlike misconduct and racket abuse following his outburst at the US Open on Sunday.\n\nMedvedev\u2019s fine is almost 40% of the $110,000 in prize money he earned for appearing in the first round of the grand slam at Flushing Meadows.\n\nThe 29-year-old was fined $30,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and $12,500 for racket abuse.\n\nDuring the Russian\u2019s first round defeat to Benjamin Bonzi in New York, the Frenchman was serving for the match and, as he prepared to play his second serve, a photographer stepped onto the court surface.\n\nThe disruption led chair umpire Greg Allensworth to put Bonzi back onto his first serve, sparking an astonishing outburst from Medvedev.\n\n\u201cAre you a man? Are you a man? Why are you shaking?\u201d the 2021 US Open winner shouted as he stormed towards the chair.\n\n\u201cHe wants to go home, guys, he doesn\u2019t like it here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour.\u201d\n\nMedvedev also repeatedly shouted, \u201cWhat did Reilly Opelka say?\u201d at the official in reference to the US player\u2019s call for Allensworth to be suspended after receiving a code violation at the Dallas Open for confronting a spectator.\n\nThe match was halted for about six minutes as jeers, whistles and boos rang out around Louis Armstrong Stadium, with fans refusing to stay quiet so Bonzi could serve.\n\nThe United States Tennis Association said the photographer was escorted from the court by US Open security and that his credentials had been revoked.\n\nBonzi threatened to walk off the court at one point and called for the Russian to be disqualified. Although Medvedev was able to rally after the incident, Bonzi would go onto win in five sets.\n\nAt the end of the match, Medvedev repeatedly hit his racket against his bench.\n\nAfter Medvedev\u2019s outburst, his longtime friend Andrey Rublev offered to support him if he wants to address his emotions.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to change and needs help, he has me, a lot of other friends and family that will help him,\u201d Rublev told reporters after his first round victory at the US Open. \u201cBut it\u2019s his life and his decision what he needs to do.\u201d\n\nThe Russian added: \u201cOnly he knows what is happening.\n\n\u201cI think he needs to take some time because it was a tough loss, but I will text him. The year he\u2019s had in the grand slams hasn\u2019t been easy.\u201d\n\nUS star Frances Tiafoe said that Medvedev\u2019s frustrations likely stem from his early exits at grand slams \u2013 in the four majors this year, Medvedev exited in the first round in three except the Australian Open where he reached the second round.\n\n\u201cHe holds himself to a super high standard,\u201d the American said. \u201cHe\u2019s been struggling and he\u2019s struggling to face the music, right? He\u2019s struggling to face losing early and to guys he feels he should be beating.\n\n\u201cAnother side comes out. I hope to see him play to the level that he\u2019s capable of playing. It\u2019s been a super tough stretch.\u201d",

      "text": "The US Open descended into chaos on Sunday when a photographer came onto the court as Daniil Medvedev faced match point, bringing the first-round match to a standstill and sparking a spectacular meltdown from the Russian.\nFormer champion Medvedev was eventually knocked out 6-3 7-5 6-7(5) 0-6 6-4 by Frenchman Benjamin Bonzi, who threatened to walk off the court at one point and called for the Russian to be disqualified.\nServing for the match at 6-3 7-5 5-4, Bonzi was preparing to play his second serve when the photographer stepped onto the court surface.\nThe disruption led chair umpire Greg Allensworth to put Bonzi back onto his first serve, sparking an astonishing outburst from Medvedev.\n\u201cAre you a man? Are you a man? Why are you shaking?\u201d the Russian shouted as he stormed towards the chair.\n\u201cHe wants to go home, guys, he doesn\u2019t like it here.

I may have got some new fans, but also some new non-fans,\u201d said world number 51 Bonzi, who has now beaten Medvedev in all three of their Grand Slam encounters, each time in the first round.\n\u201cThe energy was crazy. Thanks to all who were booing. Thanks for the energy.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced something like that. We waited maybe five minutes before the match point and it was crazy. There was so much noise.\u201d\nMedvedev becomes the first former champion to exit this year\u2019s tournament, leaving Flushing Meadows after a horrible year at the majors where he managed to get to the second round just once."

      "text": "While her tennis shone in her first-round US Open victory on Tuesday, it was Naomi Osaka\u2019s outfit \u2013 and Labubu accoutrement \u2013 which really sparkled in New York.\nFor her match against Greet Minnen in Louis Armstrong Stadium, Osaka walked onto the court with sparkly red roses in her hair, matching her shimmering red headphones and a jacket which was studded with crystals.\nThe two-time US Open champion removed the majority of the red roses from her hair and the red jacket for the match, but her playing outfit matched her sparkling form on the court, where she easily dispatched Minnen 6-3, 6-4.\nAfter the victory, Osaka explained that she had been planning the outfit for years, but the idea for the hair \u2013 which she described as a \u201clittle chaotic\u201d \u2013 came about a few weeks ago after discussions with her stylist.\n\u201cI was like: \u2018Do you think this is possible?\u2019 Maybe it was two weeks ago,\u201d the 27-year-old told reporters after her victory. \u201cYeah, we kind of just toss ideas around. Obviously, the outcome is way better than I could have imagined.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIt was really elaborate because the crystals are really hard to do on a performance outfit.\n\u201cI just thought it would be really fun to do at New York under the lights. I\u2019m glad that my first match was a night match because this outfit was really fun to play. This is my night outfit, so hopefully, I\u2019ll wear my day outfit next time. But yeah, it definitely was really elaborate.\u201d\nOsaka also said that the lengthy process of creating bespoke outfits makes her excited for the future.\n\u201c(The process is) not hard, but it always makes me excited for what\u2019s coming up that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we always have fittings months and months in advance, and I know what next year is going to look like. That just kind of makes me excited to obviously do well so I can have a good court to wear these outfits on.\u201d\nOn top of that, Osaka also came onto court with her own mascot in the form of a customized Labubu.\nOsaka\u2019s Labubu \u2013 the fluffy, sharp-toothed figurines which have shot to prominence in recent years \u2013 was attached to her bag and was covered in red and gold crystals as well as holding a sparkly blue tennis racket.\nWhen asked about her accessories on court afterwards, she held up her Labubu to the camera and explained that: \u201cShe\u2019s named Billie Jean Bling. Not Billie Jean King. Billie Jean Bling.\u201d\nWhen speaking to reporters after her win, Osaka said her favorite part of Tuesday\u2019s match was the reaction to Bille Jean Bling, saying: \u201cI\u2019m glad she made people laugh today.\u201d\nOsaka\u2019s first-round victory comes after she reached the final of the Canadian Open earlier this month, her best result since returning from maternity leave.\nShe also arrives at Flushing Meadows with a new coach added to her staff in the form of Tomasz Wiktorowski, who has previously worked closely with six-time grand slam winner Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\nOsaka, the No. 23 seed at the US Open, will face American Hailey Baptiste in the second round."

      "text": "It seems almost every time Alex Eala steps onto the court, she writes a piece of tennis history for the Philippines.\nEala made her breakthrough as a wild card at the Miami Open in March, where she defeated three grand slam champions en route to reaching her first WTA Tour semifinal.\nIn doing so, she became the first Filipina to reach a WTA semifinal, the first to record a win over a top-10 player and the first to break into the world\u2019s top 100.\nEala\u2019s wins through the first three rounds of the Miami Open were more than every player from the Philippines combined had managed at the tournament in the Open Era.\nNow, she\u2019s at it again.\nOn Sunday, the 20-year-old battled past No. 14 seed Clara Tauson 6-3, 2-6, 7-6(11) in the first round of the US Open to record her \u2013 and the Philippines\u2019 \u2013 first ever win in the main draw of a grand slam.\nAfter fighting back from 1-5 down in the final set, Eala fell to the ground and covered her face in disbelief as Tauson hit her forehand long on match point.\n\u201cI\u2019m so blessed to be the first to do this,\u201d she told reporters after the win. \u201cLike I said, I take so much pride in representing my country. It makes what I do bigger than myself, and it adds meaning to what I do.\u201d\nThere was a raucous crowd cheering Eala on at the Grandstand arena as she made her comeback in the deciding set.\nFlushing Meadows, the park where the US Open is held, is close to Little Manila in Queens, where there is a large Filipino community \u2013 and they brought the noise.\nThe roar that went up inside the stands when Eala secured match point was befitting of Arthur Ashe Stadium on the final weekend of the tournament.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so special,\u201d she said of the support in her on-court interview. \u201cThey make me more and more special. To be Filipino is something I take so much pride in.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a home tournament, so to be able to have this community here at the US Open, I\u2019m so grateful they made me feel like I\u2019m home.\u201d\nEala began training at the Rafael Nadal Academy in Spain when she was 13 years old and has long been one of tennis\u2019 most exciting prospects, winning the girls\u2019 doubles titles at the 2020 Australian Open and 2021 French Open.\nIn 2022, she became the first player from the Philippines to win a junior grand slam singles trophy when she won the US Open girls\u2019 singles title.\nThat victory vaulted her to stardom back home and led to her gracing the cover of Vogue Philippines soon after.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think that you\u2019re the first to do so, you know, because this is my first time going through the journey as well,\u201d Eala said when asked about the importance of her breakthrough for tennis in Southeast Asia.\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy to see the progress of tennis in Southeast Asia in general. I know that a girl from Indonesia also won her match today.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known her for a long time, so I\u2019m happy for her. I\u2019m happy that players from this region are coming up and starting to be successful.\u201d\nThat girl from Indonesia is 23-year-old Janice Tjen, who defeated No. 25 seed Veronika Kudermetova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 on Sunday to become the first Indonesian player to win a main draw grand slam match since Angelique Widjaja at Wimbledon in 2003.\nTjen will next face Emma Raducanu, who she has looked up to since the Brit stunned the tennis world by winning the 2021 US Open as an 18-year-old qualifier.\nTjen, who represented Pepperdine University in the US and was runner-up in the 2024 NCAA doubles, is now aiming to become the first Indonesian player to reach the third round of a grand slam since Yayuk Basuki reached the round of 32 at Wimbledon in 2000.\n\u201cJanice is super nice, I\u2019ve known her for quite a long time,\u201d Eala said. \u201cGrowing up in the same region, we would run into each other a lot in the same tournaments.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to spend a lot of time with her recently. I know she was in college and now she\u2019s playing pro and doing super well.\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for her, and it\u2019s nice to see someone that you grew up with in the biggest stages in the world.\u201d\nIn another boost for Asian tennis, 21-year-old Coleman Wong became the first men\u2019s player from Hong Kong to record a win at a grand slam in the Open Era after he defeated Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-4, 7-5, 7-6(4) in the opening round of the US Open.\nEala says her day-to-day hasn\u2019t changed much since bursting onto the scene in Miami, aside from more people recognizing her.\nHer work ethic has remained the same since she was a kid, plus she credits the \u201cgreat team\u201d around her for keeping her grounded and hungry.\nEala recently reached her first WTA Tour final at June\u2019s Eastbourne Open, where she was beaten by Maya Joint.\n\u201cJust being in these tournaments, in these slams, all the 1000s, it just motivates me so much more knowing that the same time last year, there\u2019s no way I could have gotten into the main draw with my ranking,\u201d she said.\nAnd Eala\u2019s message to Asian women who now look up to her after a whirlwhind five months? \u201cAnything is possible and dream big.\u201d"
