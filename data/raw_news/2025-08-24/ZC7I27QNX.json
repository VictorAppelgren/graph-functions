  "content": "America\u2019s next big showdown is brewing over Donald Trump\u2019s zeal to impose unusual presidential power as he eyes big, Democratic-run cities to expand a crime crackdown that sent troops flocking onto the streets of Washington, DC.\n\nTrump\u2019s torrid rhetoric claiming that crime is out of control, which is often misleading, is a classic page from the playbook of strongman leaders. It could precipitate high tensions between the federal government and states over the limits of his constitutional and legal authority.\n\nThe president\u2019s threats prompted alarmed Democrats on Sunday to warn that there would be no justification for him to dispatch troops to a city such as Chicago over local opposition.\n\n\u201cWe should continue to support local law enforcement and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he\u2019s deeply unpopular,\u201d House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Trump told reporters that \u201cChicago will be our next\u201d target while he would \u201chelp\u201d New York after that. Trump last week also name-checked Baltimore and Oakland, California, where he argued crime is \u201cvery bad.\u201d\n\nCNN reported Saturday that the Trump administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to Chicago, according to two officials. It is not yet clear how many troops would be sent to Chicago, or when those deployments would start.\n\nTrump on Sunday lashed out at Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a potential Democratic presidential hopeful in 2028, who had suggested the president walk with him through Baltimore to view local attempts to stem violent crime. The president slammed the city as \u201cout of control (and) crime ridden\u201d and said he wouldn\u2019t go there until the \u201cCrime Disaster\u201d was cleaned up.\n\nTrump\u2019s critics argue his deployment of National Guard forces in the US capital and in Los Angeles in response to demonstrations earlier this year against his immigration policies are prototype operations for wider national crackdowns.\n\nBut the president has smaller legal leeway to surge federal troops into cities and to dictate law enforcement policies in the states than in Washington, a federal district.\n\nThe consequences are huge if Trump turns from Washington to other big cities\n\nSending troops or dedicating federal agents to police work into a major city such as Chicago or Baltimore against the will of Democratic state and city officials would create a new test of the presidential powers Trump incessantly seeks to expand and would threaten state sovereignty \u2014 which Republicans have historically sought to preserve.\n\nDeclaring yet another national emergency to federalize National Guard reserve troops normally commanded by a state governor would trigger legal showdowns over Trump\u2019s preferred method of unlocking new and questionable executive authority. He suggested last week he might declare a national emergency in Washington, to get around a 30-day limit on troop deployments.\n\nA crackdown in a place like Chicago would also offer Trump the chance to ramp up his mass deportation effort with a surge force at a time when it is increasingly appearing that this is his key goal in Washington. A CNN analysis of government data found that in the first week after the administration took control of the capital\u2019s police force and deployed federal agents and troops on the streets, there was a moderate dip in reported crime while arrests of immigrants were up tenfold from typical ICE arrest tallies.\n\nChoosing a big, Democratic city would also allow Trump to choreograph a new political extravaganza in a performative presidency built on televised spectacles from summits to bill signings and dealmaking. The substance often lags the political symbolism.\n\nThe risk would be that such moves could disrupt chains of command between local elected officials and police chiefs and upset community policing initiatives designed to stem violent crime. And it would reinforce a growing impression that Trump is seeking to normalize the anomalous use of soldiers in domestic settings to purse his political priorities.\n\nAs was the case in Washington, a Chicago crackdown would give Trump another opening to impose his conservative power and autocratic tendencies on a population that voted overwhelmingly for his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in 2024.\n\nAnd it would enable him to put Democrats in a political vise, forcing them to walk a tightrope between rejecting federal takeovers and his hardline tactics while risking alienating voters who are concerned about violent crime and the impact of past lax border policies.\n\nThen there is the question of paying for all this.\n\nTrump\u2019s growing zeal for using federal troops and agents will sooner or later raise the question of resources. Prolonged National Guard deployments are expensive. Redeploying federal agents from other duties could affect the FBI\u2019s ability to target transnational crime or anti-terrorism investigations. The resource issue raises questions about the administration\u2019s capacity to enact long-term reductions in crime since open-ended deployments are unsustainable.\n\nTrump\u2019s warnings about supposedly lawless inner cities do not necessarily reflect the true picture of public order. For example, crime in Washington fell in 2024, and again so far this year. In Chicago, the police said Friday that homicides were down 31% this year, and shootings fell 36%. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean people who live in big cities feel safe. Many would welcome seeing more police on the streets, and cities and states have been calling on the federal government for more partnerships and resources \u2014 but balk at Trump\u2019s imposed solutions.\n\nThe president\u2019s dystopian descriptions increasingly resemble an attempt to create a rhetorical crime emergency that he could then use to justify draconian methods that satisfy his desire to look strong and his attempts to push up deportations.\n\nAs Trump stokes a sense of crisis, Democrats are resisting\n\nFormer Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel told Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, \u201cI think everybody should take a step back and realize that, as a commander in chief over his two terms, he\u2019s only deployed and put boots on the ground in American cities, never overseas. And just think about what that means as a country.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel, a CNN senior political and global affairs commentator, suggested that Trump\u2019s true purpose was to redouble immigration enforcement in cities \u2014 like Chicago \u2014 that do not cooperate with federal authorities in crackdowns against undocumented migrants. \u201cThis will not be about fighting crime,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Emmanuel, a former senior member of Democratic House leadership, White House chief of staff and ambassador to Japan, offered some advice for his party, which has sometimes struggled to connect with voters on crime. \u201cWe have a strategy for fighting crime: more police on the beat and getting kids, gangs and guns off the street.\u201d\n\nJeffries, from New York, said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that Democrats, like all Americans, want safer communities, but opposed Trump\u2019s power grabs. \u201cWe should make sure that the flood of guns into these communities is cut off. We should make sure that we\u2019re dealing with the mental health crisis that exists all across the United States of America, and, by the way, which Donald Trump is exacerbating by cutting funds to actually help people who are dealing with emotional distress.\u201d\n\nDemocratic local leaders are trying to discredit the president\u2019s claim that crime is so out of control in cities as to merit such a crackdown.\n\nOn Saturday, JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, issued a statement pointing out that his state had received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking whether it needs help, after Trump named Chicago as a future venue for his surge of military and federal personnel. \u201cThere is no emergency that warrants the President of the United States federalizing the Illinois National Guard, deploying the National Guard from other states, or sending active-duty military within our own borders,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Pritzker signaled that he\u2019d do everything he could to push back against outside, federal power. \u201cWe will continue to follow the law, stand up for the sovereignty of our state, and protect the people of Illinois,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sunday, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul told CNN\u2019s Isabel Rosales that his office sought to work with federal entities including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Secret Service. He said those agencies were trained to combat crime, while the National Guard is not.\n\nTrump is \u201coperating as a dictator,\u201d Raoul said. \u201cTurning the military against these American citizens in cities on American land is unprecedented.\u201d",

      "text": "In the first week after the White House effectively seized control of Washington, DC\u2019s police force and deployed federal agents and troops to the district, the city saw a moderate drop in reported crime \u2014 and a far larger surge in arrests of immigrants, a CNN analysis of government data found.\nIn the week beginning August 12, the first full day the Trump administration had control of the Metropolitan Police Department, property crimes dropped roughly 19% compared to the week before, and violent crime dipped by about 17%, according to the most recent public data published by the MPD.\nThose trends vary widely by types of crimes, however. While robberies and car break-ins were down by more than 40%, other thefts were flat week-to-week and there was a 6% increase in burglary cases and a 14% increase in cases of assault with a dangerous weapon, the data shows. There have been two murders since President Donald Trump signed his executive order taking control of the department, which is consistent with recent weeks in DC, though none since August 13.\nThe drop in overall crime comes as federal agencies have embedded themselves with local officers, assisting in arrests, searches, warrant executions and other local police work as they drive around the district in vehicles only marked by their occasional flashing blue and red lights.\nAt the same time, the wave of ICE agents deployed to the district have fueled a much more dramatic increase in arrests of immigrants.\nSince August 7, federal officials have arrested 300 people in DC who don\u2019t have legal immigration status, the administration said \u2014 a more than tenfold increase over the typical ICE arrest numbers for the district, CNN\u2019s review found.\nOver the first six months of Trump\u2019s term, the agency arrested about 12 immigrants in DC per week on average, according to data published by the Deportation Data Project, a research group associated with the University of California, Berkeley law school.\nICE agents trail MPD officers, ready to respond if anyone pulled over or questioned has overstayed their visa or otherwise is in the country unlawfully, one law enforcement official told CNN.\nIn response to CNN\u2019s findings, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the media was trying to dismiss the \u201cexceptional results\u201d of Trump\u2019s efforts in DC.\n\u201cThe drops in crime are not \u2018moderate,\u2019 they are life-changing for the countless of DC residents and visitors who have not been murdered, robbed, carjacked, or victims of overall violent crime in the last week,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe priority of this operation remains getting violent criminals off the streets \u2014 regardless of immigration status.\u201d\nAccording to the administration, the immigrants arrested include people who have been arrested for committing crimes or have outstanding warrants, including for some serious offenses. CNN couldn\u2019t independently verify the details of those arrests or what percentage of arrestees have been accused of non-immigration offenses.\nThe noticeable spike in immigration numbers also echoes concerns by some DC leaders, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, that the true purpose of Trump\u2019s local takeover is to pursue undocumented immigrants.\nWhen asked Thursday whether Trump\u2019s crime emergency was a pretext to enforce the administration\u2019s immigration efforts, Bowser told reporters that a recent order from Attorney General Pam Bondi \u201calmost exclusively focused on immigration enforcement and homeless encampment enforcement.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll let you draw your own conclusion,\u201d Bowser said.\nDC\u2019s attorney general has filed a lawsuit challenging Bondi\u2019s order to ignore sanctuary laws on the books in DC, which previously limited the police force\u2019s ability to cooperate with ICE on immigration cases. During a hearing last week, however, the federal judge presiding over the case indicated that Trump\u2019s authority under the Home Rule Act likely allows him to order police to assist ICE.\nViral videos have circulated in DC this week of ICE agents \u2014 donning their now-signature masks \u2014 tackling immigrants, including some food delivery workers, and in one instance breaking car windows to arrest two men.\nDuring one evening of the heightened police presence this week, CNN tracked officers responding to reports of shootings, drug and firearm possessions and one stolen vehicle. Federal agents communicated over local police channels as they stopped and searched vehicles and responded to reports of crime, warning each other about DC\u2019s speed cameras.\nMPD and federal partners have also established traffic checkpoints in the past week \u2014 a law enforcement tool that\u2019s not common in the district \u2014 including a large checkpoint with dozens of officers and agents on a highway leading out of the city.\nOfficers were seen pulling over certain vehicles and conducting searches, though it was unclear how law enforcement were determining who to pull over and who to allow through.\nAs night fell, police chatter picked up, with local and federal officers weaving through the streets together in long lines of flashing lights and speeding unmarked cars.\nBut some incidents, like a shooting in one of the higher crime areas in the Southeast area of the city, were handled solely by MPD officers.\n\u201cThey only come when bad sh*t happens,\u201d one resident standing outside of the police tape following the shooting told CNN.\nOn Wednesday night, there appeared to be relatively few federal agents patrolling the streets of DC on foot, something that was commonly seen in the first few days of Trump\u2019s federal response. Instead, agents remained in their nondescript vehicles, waiting for calls to blip in through the radio.\n\u201cIt just feels like overkill,\u201d another DC resident told CNN during a night out on the popular U-Street corridor in the city, lined with restaurants, clubs and vape shops.\nRoughly eight in 10 DC residents oppose Trump\u2019s police takeover and his deployment of the National Guard and FBI to the city, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. Vice President JD Vance and other administration figures have dismissed that survey finding, claiming without citing evidence that the federal surge is popular with local residents.\nThe full picture of crime in DC under Trump\u2019s control is likely to keep evolving. The numbers analyzed by CNN are based on the preliminary data available Friday morning and could change over time, as some crimes take longer to be entered into the department\u2019s database. And the data does not cover all crimes in the city; only some types of offenses are reported daily by the department.\nThe statistics have also become a political pressure point in Trump\u2019s takeover. On Friday, the president on social media threatened \u201ca complete and total Federal takeover of the City,\u201d accusing Bowser of promoting \u201cfalse and highly inaccurate crime figures.\u201d\nWhile local officials have pointed to a decline in DC crime in 2024 and 2025 after a spike in 2023, the Trump Justice Department is now investigating whether MPD manipulated crime data.\nThe investigation comes following reports that an MPD commander was placed on administrative leave amid accusations that the department was falsifying crime data in one district, marking offenses as lower-level crimes than they might actually be. The MPD\u2019s own probe into the issue is ongoing.\nBut Trump has also overstated the impact of the federal takeover, proclaiming on Friday that it had caused a public safety \u201cmiracle\u201d unseen in recent memory \u2014 the nation\u2019s capital going a week without a single reported homicide.\n\u201cDC was a hellhole, and now it\u2019s safe,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday. \u201cI hate to say this, because it doesn\u2019t sound very good, but there have been no murders in DC in the last week. That\u2019s the first time in anybody\u2019s memory that you haven\u2019t had a murder in a week.\u201d\nIt\u2019s correct that there have been no murders in DC over the last week, according to the public MPD data. Two murders have taken place since Trump signed his executive order wresting control of the police department \u2013 one on the evening of August 11, the same day the order was signed, and another on August 13.\nThis is not the first recent week without homicides, as Trump claimed. There were no murders reported from May 4 through May 11, April 11 to 17, and a more than two-week-long period from February 25 through March 12.\nThere have been a total of 89 homicides committed so far in 2025, according to the district\u2019s data. In some cases, murders are confirmed and added into the public MPD database weeks or months after they occur, so it\u2019s possible that additional cases will be added.\nProtests against the crackdown have been sporadic, with residents in some neighborhoods taking to the streets after ICE or other federal agents are spotted, sometimes forming crowds around the officers and chanting for them to leave.\nIn court, Justice Department attorneys said Trump\u2019s authority over the MPD will expire at the end of the 30-day period set out in the Home Rule Act \u2014 which the president has cited for his authority.\nBut neither the DOJ nor the White House have said whether Trump will continue to use federal agents and the hundreds of National Guard members he has deployed after his month of control over the police department expires. The president himself has said he could keep them there \u201cas long as I want.\u201d\nThis article has been updated with additional information."

      "text": "President Donald Trump said Thursday he would expand the law enforcement and National Guard crackdown he ordered in Washington, DC, this month to other jurisdictions as he appeared at a US Park Police facility to promote the initiative.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make it safe, and we\u2019re going to then go on to other places, but we\u2019re going to stay here for a while,\u201d he said to dozens of law enforcement agents and National Guard members gathered outside the facility to hear him speak.\nEarlier this month, Trump ordered the federal government to take control of DC\u2019s police department and deployed National Guard troops \u2013 a broad federal effort that has drawn the ire of many city residents.\nTrump had teased earlier in the day that he planned to join law enforcement in the streets of DC, though he appeared to scrap those plans for a more standard meet-and-greet with those he has deployed. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that some members of the Secret Service\u2019s Washington Field Office, who would handle a presidential movement like this one, had been caught off guard by the president\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be going out tonight, I think, with the police, and with the military, of course,\u201d the president told radio host Todd Starnes earlier Thursday.\nTrump would not likely be able to duplicate the DC initiative exactly if he were to try it in other areas of the country. DC, which is not a part of any state, has restrictions on its ability to govern its own affairs, and the president has the ability to effectively federalize its police force. The city also has a far more robust regular federal law enforcement presence than other US cities.\nTrump arrived at the US Park Police facility in Southeast Washington, DC, a little after 5:20 p.m. Joining him for the visit were Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Emil Bove, a controversial former Justice Department official who was recently confirmed as a federal appeals court judge, also attended.\nTrump spent a little more than a half an hour there, bringing hamburgers from the White House and pizza from Wiseguy Pizza.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s safe now. Everybody feels safe,\u201d Trump said.\nHis appearance follows another staged event centered on the DC takeover on Wednesday, when Vice President JD Vance visited a Shake Shack at Union Station at lunchtime to thank National Guard members who have been deployed to the city.\nDuring that event, Vance was frequently drowned out by protesters as he appeared alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Miller. Blocked from the second-floor area where the guardsmen lunch was taking place, the protesters loudly chanted \u201cshame,\u201d \u201cthis is our city,\u201d and \u201cwe want the military out of our streets.\u201d\nTrump has repeatedly decried crime in DC, though overall reported crime numbers are lower this year than in 2024, and cast his moves in the city as an effort to make the nation\u2019s capital safer and more beautiful. More than 1,900 National Guard troops from multiple states \u2014 including the DC, West Virginia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Ohio, Louisiana and Tennessee guards \u2014 have been mobilized in DC as of Thursday, according to Joint Task Force-DC.\nIn a post on Truth Social early Friday, Trump hailed law enforcement and the National Guard, writing \u201cWashington, D.C. is SAFE AGAIN! The crowds are coming back, the spirit is high, and our D.C. National Guard and Police are doing a fantastic job.\u201d\nThe campaign also involves clearing homeless encampments. Vance on Thursday declined to say where law enforcement officials are sending people once their tents are cleared, replying that \u201cthe question betrays a certain misunderstanding of what we\u2019re trying to do and what is the nature of real compassion.\u201d\nHe then recounted a story about his family being yelled during a trip to DC years ago, arguing that the administration is focused on keeping those with mental health issues off the streets.\n\u201cWhy have we convinced ourselves that it\u2019s compassionate to allow a person who\u2019s obviously a schizophrenic, or suffering from some other mental illness, why is it compassionate to let that person fester in the streets?\u201d Vance said.\nVance, who was in Georgia to tout Republicans\u2019 domestic policy law, also demurred when asked if the White House plans to deploy troops to other cities, but he did not rule it out.\n\u201cWe have focused on Washington, DC, because it\u2019s a federal city under our jurisdiction. But we certainly hope that, whether it\u2019s Atlanta or anywhere else, people are going to look around and say, \u2018We don\u2019t have to live like this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope that people see what we\u2019re doing in Washington, DC, and follow our example all across the country.\u201d\nAmong those who live in DC, Trump\u2019s police takeover is unpopular. A 79% majority of DC residents oppose the president ordering the federal government to take control of the city\u2019s police department and ordering the National Guard and FBI to patrol the city, a new Washington Post-Schar School poll finds.\nThis headline and story have been updated."

      "text": "The Trump administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to Chicago, two officials told CNN, as President Donald Trump looks to expand his anti-crime agenda and crackdown on immigration in major cities across the United States.\nIt is not yet clear how many troops would be sent to Chicago, or when those deployments would start.\nTrump seemed to preview those plans in the Oval Office on Friday, saying, \u201cI think Chicago will be our next, and then we\u2019ll help with New York.\u201d\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, said Friday that the city has not heard from the White House about the deployment or any increased law enforcement presence, adding that such a move would be \u201cuncalled for\u201d and \u201cunlawful.\u201d\n\u201cThere are many things the federal government could do to help us reduce crime and violence in Chicago, but sending in the military is not one of them,\u201d Johnson said in a statement.\nJohnson told MSNBC on Sunday the city would take legal action if Trump sent troops into the city, adding that \u201cthe people of this city are accustomed to rising up against tyranny.\u201d\n\u201cWhat he is proposing at this point would be the most flagrant violation of our Constitution in the 21st century. The city of Chicago does not need a military occupation,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we need. In fact, we\u2019ve been very clear about what we need. We need to invest in people to ensure that we can build safe and affordable communities.\u201d\nWhen asked for comment, the White House on Saturday referred CNN to Trump\u2019s remarks in the Oval Office a day earlier. The president said Friday he hadn\u2019t spoken to the Chicago mayor when asked by a reporter whether he had taken any \u201cconcrete steps\u201d toward a crackdown in the city.\nA spokesperson for the Pentagon told CNN, \u201cWe won\u2019t speculate on further operations. The Department is a planning organization and is continuously working with other agency partners on plans to protect federal assets and personnel.\u201d\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement Saturday that he has not heard from the federal government and that Illinois has not made requests to the federal government for help.\n\u201cThe safety of the people of Illinois is always my top priority. There is no emergency that warrants the President of the United States federalizing the Illinois National Guard, deploying the National Guard from other states, or sending active duty military within our own borders,\u201d Pritzker said.\nThe plans align with the Trump administration\u2019s unusual efforts to use the military for law enforcement and immigration actions within the US\u2019 borders.\nThe administration\u2019s potential moves in Chicago, first reported by the Washington Post, would be different from the law enforcement crackdown in Washington, DC, where Trump \u2014 and in turn the federal government \u2014 has more leeway in directing troops and a range of federal authorities.\nInstead, the administration\u2019s future plans, including in Chicago, are expected to look like Trump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard earlier this summer to Los Angeles to quell immigration protests, sources told CNN.\nIn June, Trump evoked Title 10 of the US Code to send about 700 active-duty Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles over the objection of California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. Title 10 allows the president to deploy the National Guard as necessary to repel invasion, suppress rebellion or execute laws, which means the National Guard reports to the president rather than the governor.\nCalifornia immediately challenged the legality of Trump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard in a lawsuit that is making its way through the court system.\nStill, Trump touted the move as an unmitigated success. \u201cWithout the Military, Los Angeles would be a crime scene like we haven\u2019t seen in years,\u201d he wrote on social media in June.\nIt is not uncommon for federal authorities, like the National Guard, to assist in emergency situations across the country in cases of disaster relief or civil unrest. But experts say that sending in the National Guard in a blanket order to crack down on crime and implement Trump\u2019s immigration policies is unprecedented.\nAs the administration looks to expand its immigration agenda inside the US, rather than just on the southern border, it has tried to augment Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s capacity by pulling personnel from multiple agencies, including the US military.\nCNN has previously reported that internal discussions have included how to mobilize active-duty troops from consenting states as force protection for federal agents and whether National Guard units from Republican-led states could be used in non-consenting states.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has also made clear that cities and states across the country with so-called sanctuary policies, which limit local officials from assisting in federal immigration enforcement, could be a target for the National Guard.\nHowever, Democratic governors and city mayors are pushing back.\n\u201cStop attacking our cities to hide your administration\u2019s failures,\u201d Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat, said earlier this week in response to a letter from Bondi.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nCNN\u2019s Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report."

      "text": "Elsewhere, there has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts \u2014 but little concrete progress \u2014 since US President Donald Trump\u2019s recent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nWe\u2019ve rounded up the latest lines on the conflict for you, below:\n\u2022 Trump\u2019s letter: The US president sent a letter of support to Ukraine as the country marks the anniversary of declaring itself free of Soviet rule. Zelensky shared the letter on X and delivered his own message on the country\u2019s 34th Independence Day: We will not lose. US envoy Keith Kellogg also attended a ceremony marking the occasion in Kyiv today.\n\u2022 Zelensky on security guarantees: Zelensky said Saturday that a plan for US and European security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace deal \u201cwill be ready in the coming days,\u201d following calls with several world leaders.\nSecurity guarantees have become the focal point of recent talks, with Kyiv\u2019s western allies pledging they would provide backup for Ukraine to deter any future attacks by Russia.\n\u2022 Putin on restoring US relations: Putin said Friday that the US and Russia are discussing the possibility of joint projects in Alaska and that he views recent talks as a step toward \u201cfull-scale restoration\u201d of the countries\u2019 relationship.\nIn comments reported by Russia state media TASS, Putin described his meeting with Trump in Alaska as \u201cvery good\u201d and said Russia sought an end to the fighting in Ukraine, but did not mention whether he would attend bilateral talks with Zelensky.\n\u2022 Trump\u2019s deadline extended \u2014 again: The US president said Friday he will give Putin \u201ca couple of weeks,\u201d further extending his deadline for potential consequences against Moscow after urging the Russian leader to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart.\nAsked by CNN\u2019s Alayna Treene if there\u2019s a possibility he does nothing if Putin doesn\u2019t come to the table, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll see whose fault it is.\u201d"

      "text": "President Donald Trump is moving systematically to tighten his grip on Democratic-leaning big cities \u2014 the geographic center of resistance to his agenda \u2014 by undermining their autonomy and eroding their political strength.\nThose militant goals are the common thread that links the high-profile initiatives Trump has launched in recent days to seize control of law enforcement in Washington, DC; pressure red states to draw new congressional district lines; and potentially pursue an unprecedented \u201credo\u201d of the 2020 census.\nThese new efforts compound the pressure Trump is already placing on major cities with an agenda that includes aggressive immigration enforcement; cuts in federal research funding to universities central to the economy of many large metros; and threats to rescind federal funding for jurisdictions that resist his demands to impose conservative policies on immigration, education, homelessness and policing.\nTrump is pursuing this confrontational approach at a time when major metropolitan areas have become the undisputed engines of the nation\u2019s economic growth \u2014 and the nexus of research breakthroughs in technologies such as artificial intelligence, which Trump has identified as key to the nation\u2019s competitiveness. The 100 largest metropolitan areas now account for about three-fourths of the nation\u2019s economic output, according to research by Brookings Metro, a center-left think tank. Yet Trump is treating the largest cities less as an economic asset to be nourished than as a political threat to be subdued.\nMark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro, said Trump\u2019s approach to the nation\u2019s largest cities is \u201ccolonial\u201d in that he wants to benefit from their prodigious economic output while suppressing their independence and political clout. This administration is \u201ctreating America\u2019s great economic engines as weak and problematic colonial outposts,\u201d Muro said. \u201cThey view them as the problem, when (in reality) they are the absolute base of American competitiveness in the battle against China or whoever (else).\u201d\nAntagonism toward major cities has long been central to Trump\u2019s message. Several times he has described American cities with mayors who are Democrats, members of racial minorities, or both, as dystopian \u201crodent-infested\u201d \u201chellholes.\u201d Trump in 2024 nonetheless ran better in most large cities than in his earlier races, amid widespread disenchantment about then-President Joe Biden\u2019s record on inflation, immigration and crime.\nStill, as Trump himself has noted, large cities, and often their inner suburbs, remain the foundation of Democratic political strength and the cornerstone of opposition to his agenda. A series of dramatic actions just in the past few days shows how systematically Trump is moving to debilitate those cities\u2019 ability to oppose him.\nNormalizing \u2018militarized cities\u2019\nThe most visible way Trump is pressuring big cities is by deploying federal law enforcement and military personnel into them over the objections of local officials. In his first term, Trump sent federal law enforcement personnel into Portland, Oregon, and Washington, DC, in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s 2020 murder.\nBut after he left office, Trump, who does not often publicly second-guess himself, frequently said that one of his greatest regrets was that he did not dispatch more federal forces into cities. In his 2024 campaign, he explicitly pledged to deploy the National Guard, and potentially active-duty military, into major cities for multiple purposes: combating crime, clearing homeless encampments and supporting his mass deportation program.\nIn office, Trump has steadily fulfilled those promises. When protests erupted in Los Angeles in June over an intense Immigration and Custom Enforcement deportation push, Trump deployed not only the National Guard (which he federalized over the objection of California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom), but also active-duty Marines. Then, the administration used those forces not only to guard federal buildings, but also to accompany ICE (and other agencies) on enforcement missions \u2014 including a striking deployment of armored vehicles and soldiers in tactical gear to a public park in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood.\nThe underlying immigration enforcement that precipitated the LA protests constituted a different show of force. As a recent CNN investigation showed, ICE is relying much more on street apprehensions in cities in blue states than in red states, where it is removing more people from jails and prisons. The administration says that imbalance is a result of \u201csanctuary\u201d policies in blue states and cities limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. But civil rights groups see the administration\u2019s confrontational blue-state approach as an attempt to intimidate both local officials and immigrant communities. (The fact that ICE last week conducted an immigration sweep directly outside a Newsom press conference bolstered the latter interpretation.)\nWhatever the rationale, research by the University of California at Merced suggests the administration\u2019s enforcement approach is hurting blue cities. Using census data, the school\u2019s Community and Labor Center recently found that from May to July the number of California workers holding a private-sector job fell by about 750,000 \u2014 proportionally an even greater decline than during the 2008 Great Recession. Hispanic people and Asian Americans accounted for almost all the falloff.\nSociology professor Ed Flores, the center\u2019s faculty director, said he believes the decline is \u201cabsolutely\u201d tied to economic disruption flowing from \u201cthe presence of ICE and the way that (people) are being apprehended\u201d on the street.\nNew York City, too, has seen a notable drop in the labor force participation rate among Hispanic men.\nNow, with the military (if not ICE) presence in LA winding down, Trump has sent hundreds of National Guard troops into Washington, DC, while also utilizing a section of federal law that allows him to temporarily seize control of the city\u2019s police department.\nIn his news conference last week announcing the DC moves, Trump repeatedly said he would supplement the National Guard forces, as he did in LA, with active-duty troops if he deems it necessary. And he repeatedly signaled that he is considering deploying military forces into other cities that he described as overrun by crime, including Chicago, New York, Baltimore and Oakland, California \u2014 all jurisdictions with Black mayors. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose our cities over this, and this will go further,\u201d Trump declared.\nMost experts agree that Trump will confront substantial legal hurdles if he tries to replicate the DC deployment in other places. \u201cWhat they are doing in DC is not repeatable elsewhere for a number of reasons,\u201d said Joseph Nunn, a counsel in the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\nNunn said Trump can order this mission because of the DC National Guard\u2019s unique legal status. On the one hand, Nunn noted, the DC Guard is under the president\u2019s direct control, rather than the jurisdiction of a state governor. On the other, he said, the Justice Department has ruled that even when the president utilizes the DC Guard, its actions qualify as a state, not federal, deployment. That\u2019s critical because state guard deployments are not subject to the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act\u2019s ban on federal military forces engaging in domestic law enforcement.\nIf Trump tries to deploy the National Guard to address crime in the big cities of blue states, such as Chicago or New York, Nunn argued, he would face a catch-22. Since there\u2019s virtually no chance Democratic governors would agree to participate, Trump could only put troops on those streets by federalizing their states\u2019 National Guard or using active-duty military, Nunn said. But, he added, \u201conce they are working with federalized National Guard or active-duty military forces, the Posse Comitatus Act applies\u201d \u2014 barring the use of those forces for domestic law enforcement.\nTrump could seek to override the Posse Comitatus Act\u2019s ban on military involvement by invoking the Insurrection Act. The Insurrection Act has not been used to combat street crime, but the statute allows the president to domestically deploy the military against \u201cany insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy.\u201d\nRichard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor who specializes in the relationships among different levels of government, agreed that invoking the Insurrection Act to justify sending the National Guard into cities over mayors\u2019 objections would shatter the generally understood limits on the law\u2019s application.\nBut he also believes that precedent provides no firm assurance that this Supreme Court, which has proved extremely receptive to Trump\u2019s expansive claims of presidential authority, would stop him. Trump \u201ccould try\u201d to win court approval of military deployments to fight crime by citing the Insurrection Act\u2019s language about \u201c\u2018domestic violence\u2019 and \u2018unlawful combinations\u2019\u201d and then claiming that is \u201cdepriving the people of their right to security,\u201d Briffault said.\nWhatever the legal hurdles, more widely deploying the military on domestic missions would bring substantial consequences. Mayor Jerry Dyer of Fresno, California, who spent 18 years as the city\u2019s police commissioner, says that putting military forces onto the streets of more cities would create problems of coordination with local officials and trust with local communities. \u201cWhenever you start sending federal resources into local jurisdictions and actually take over the policing of that jurisdiction, it can become very disturbing to that community and quite frankly can create some neighborhood issues and ultimately a lack of trust,\u201d said Dyer, who co-chairs the Mayors and Police Chiefs Task Force for the US Conference of Mayors.\nEven more profound may be the implications of numbing Americans to the sight of heavily armored military forces routinely patrolling the streets of domestic cities \u2014 an image that historically has been common only in authoritarian countries. New York University historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a leading scholar of authoritarian regimes, wrote last week that the ultimate aim of Trump\u2019s domestic deployments \u201cis to habituate Americans to see militarized cities and crackdowns against public dissent in cities as normal and justified.\u201d Step by step, she argued, Trump is seeking \u201cto disempower and delegitimize all Democratic municipal and state authorities.\u201d\nHow the redistricting war is marginalizing cities\nIn less obvious ways, the battle that has erupted over redistricting \u2014 and the likely fight approaching over the census \u2014 constitutes another Trump-backed effort to \u201cdisempower\u201d large metropolitan areas.\nThe unusual mid-decade congressional redistricting that Texas Republicans are pursuing at Trump\u2019s behest would increase the number of Republican-leaning US House seats largely by reducing the number of districts representing the state\u2019s biggest metropolitan areas, including Dallas, Houston and Austin, which all lean Democratic.\nThe new map would further dilute the political influence of Texas\u2019 major metro areas, even as they have accounted for about four-fifths of the state\u2019s population and economic growth over recent years, said Steven Pedigo, director of the LBJ Urban Lab at the University of Texas\u2019 Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs.\n\u201cThe growth in Texas has been driven by urban communities, but those communities are not going to be represented in these additional maps,\u201d Pedigo said.\nIn that way, the new Texas map extends the strategy that Republicans there, and in other growing Sun Belt states, used in the maps they drew after the 2020 census, said John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.\nStates such as Texas and Florida that added the most House seats and electoral votes after the 2020 census \u2014 and are poised to gain the most again after 2030 \u2014 are adding population primarily among non-White people and in Democratic-leaning metro areas, Bisognano noted in a recent memo. Yet both of those groups will be denied the additional House representation generated by that population growth if the Republicans controlling Sun Belt state governments continue to draw district lines that splinter metro populations and favor rural ones. \u201cThey are subjugating (metro voters) to produce a partisan outcome that is not reflective of the people of those cities,\u201d Bisognano said.\nThe calls from Trump and Vice President JD Vance to \u201credo\u201d the 2020 census, partly to exclude undocumented immigrants, could marginalize cities even more.\nEven if Trump could surmount the many legal and logistical obstacles to conducting a mid-decade census, a reapportionment of House seats and electoral votes that excluded undocumented immigrants would not result in the shift of influence from blue to red states that many conservatives envision. John Robert Warren, a University of Minnesota sociologist, concluded in a 2025 paper that if unauthorized immigrants were excluded from the 2020 census, California and Texas would each lose a House seat and New York and Ohio would each gain one. \u201cIt would make literally zero difference,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIf you assume Texas and Ohio go red and California and New York go blue, then it\u2019s just a wash.\u201d\nExcluding undocumented immigrants from the count, though, could offer Trump another way to squeeze urban centers. Many agricultural communities have substantial undocumented immigrant populations, but half of all undocumented immigrants live in just 37 large counties, according to estimates by the Migration Policy Institute. \u201cWithin a state that Republicans control, by not including (undocumented people), it would be much easier to draw Republican districts because you would have a smaller minority population base to work with,\u201d said Jeffrey Wice, a redistricting expert at New York Law School. Not only congressional representation but also the many federal funding sources tied to population would shift toward rural areas if the census undercounts the urban population, he noted.\nWice, who formerly consulted for Democrats on redistricting, says blue states and cities can\u2019t assume Trump won\u2019t pursue any of these possibilities, no matter how far-fetched they now seem. The same is surely true on the deployment of federal force into blue places. The New Republic\u2019s Greg Sargent recently published an internal Department of Homeland Security memo that described the joint ICE-National Guard mission in Los Angeles as \u201cthe type of operations (and resistance) we\u2019re going to be working through for years to come.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nDuring World War II, the German siege of Leningrad famously lasted nearly 900 days. Big blue American cities may be counting down the hours as anxiously for the 1252 days remaining in Trump\u2019s second term."

US envoy Keith Kellogg also attended a ceremony marking the occasion in Kyiv today.\n\u2022 Zelensky on security guarantees: Zelensky said Saturday that a plan for US and European security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace deal \u201cwill be ready in the coming days,\u201d following calls with several world leaders.\nSecurity guarantees have become the focal point of recent talks, with Kyiv\u2019s western allies pledging they would provide backup for Ukraine to deter any future attacks by Russia.\n\u2022 Putin on restoring US relations: Putin said Friday that the US and Russia are discussing the possibility of joint projects in Alaska and that he views recent talks as a step toward \u201cfull-scale restoration\u201d of the countries\u2019 relationship.\nIn comments reported by Russia state media TASS, Putin described his meeting with Trump in Alaska as \u201cvery good\u201d and said Russia sought an end to the fighting in Ukraine, but did not mention whether he would attend bilateral talks with Zelensky.\n\u2022 Trump\u2019s deadline extended \u2014 again: The US president said Friday he will give Putin \u201ca couple of weeks,\u201d further extending his deadline for potential consequences against Moscow after urging the Russian leader to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart.\nAsked by CNN\u2019s Alayna Treene if there\u2019s a possibility he does nothing if Putin doesn\u2019t come to the table, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll see whose fault it is.\u201d"

      "text": "President Donald Trump said Friday that Chicago will be the next city that his administration targets for a federal crackdown on crime and suggested a longer and more intense campaign in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll straighten that one out, probably next, that will be our next one after this,\u201d Trump said from the Oval Office. \u201cI think Chicago will be our next and then we\u2019ll help with New York.\u201d\nThe president has credited his federal takeover of Washington, DC\u2019s police force and deployment of the National Guard there with driving down crime in the city \u2014 touting a weeklong stretch without any murders as a \u201cmiracle\u201d despite the fact that such weeks have occurred in DC multiple times so far this year.\nHe said he could keep National Guard members in the city \u201cas long as I want\u201d by declaring a national emergency, a prospect likely to unnerve city residents. More than 1,900 National Guard troops from multiple states \u2014 including DC, West Virginia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Ohio, Louisiana and Tennessee guards \u2014 have been mobilized in DC as of Thursday, according to Joint Task Force-DC.\nTrump also took aim at DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and threatened to do more than just seize control of the police force if she didn\u2019t \u201cget her act straight.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of listening to these people say how safe it was before we got here. It was unsafe. It was horrible. And Mayor Bowser better get her act straight, or she won\u2019t be mayor very long because we\u2019ll take it over with the federal government running like it\u2019s supposed to be run,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump dismissed polling that showed most city residents disapprove of the deployment of federal troops, calling it \u201cfake news\u201d and claiming that residents of Chicago and cities are clamoring for a similar law enforcement crackdown where they live.\n\u201cThey\u2019re wearing red hats, African American ladies, beautiful ladies, are saying, \u2018Please, President Trump, come to Chicago,\u2019\u201d Trump said.\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement: \u201cWe take President Trump\u2019s statements seriously, but to be clear the City has not received any formal communication from the Trump administration regarding additional federal law enforcement or military deployments to Chicago.\u201d He said homicides, robberies and shootings have dropped significantly in the past year.\n\u201cCertainly, we have grave concerns about the impact of any unlawful deployment of National Guard troops to the City of Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem with the President\u2019s approach is that it is uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound. Unlawfully deploying the National Guard to Chicago has the potential to inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement when we know that trust between police and residents is foundational to building safer communities.\u201d\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker said on X that Trump had used Los Angeles and Washington, DC, as \u201chis testing ground for authoritarian overreach\u201d and he was now trying \u201cto incite fear in our communities and destabilize existing public safety efforts \u2014 all to create a justification to further abuse his power.\u201d\nFor his part, Trump attacked Johnson as \u201cincompetent,\u201d claiming the city has grown dangerous on his watch and vowing to use the federal government to intervene.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re ready, we\u2019ll go in and we\u2019ll straighten out Chicago just like we did DC,\u201d he said.\nIt was not immediately clear how a federal crackdown in Chicago would work and how closely it would resemble what has happened in DC. The district is not a part of any state and has restrictions on its ability to govern its own affairs, so the president has the ability to effectively federalize its police force.\nIn his comments Friday, Trump seemed to conflate keeping the National Guard deployed in DC with his takeover of the local police department. He said he could subvert a provision under the District of Columbia\u2019s Home Rule Act, which says the federal government can seize control of the city\u2019s police force for up to 30 days during emergencies. After that, he would need congressional approval to continue controlling the Metropolitan Police Department.\nIn a hearing last week, Justice Department attorneys told a federal judge that unless Congress extended Trump\u2019s ability to effectively control Washington, DC\u2019s police department, Trump\u2019s order would expire.\nBut Trump, who pledged to eliminate crime when he deployed federal law enforcement earlier this month, has now suggested on multiple occasions that he\u2019ll need to maintain his influence over the city\u2019s policing for far longer to cut down on crime long-term.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to get them out, it\u2019s another thing to keep them out for a long period of time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take more than 30 days.\u201d\nThe president also said he\u2019s already talked with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune about a planned request for $2 billion to funnel toward beautifying DC. He said that would be \u201cvery easy to get.\u201d\nAs CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale has reported, violent crime in DC declined in 2024 and 2025 after a spike in 2023. The Justice Department is investigating whether the DC Metropolitan Police Department manipulated crime dated.\nBrad Parks contributed to this report.\nThis developing story has been updated."

  "argos_summary": "President Trump has announced plans to deploy the National Guard and federal law\u2011enforcement forces to Chicago, following a similar takeover of Washington, DC\u2019s police department, citing a crime crisis that he claims has been reduced by federal intervention. Democratic city officials, state governors, and civil\u2011rights groups warn that such moves would violate constitutional limits, undermine local sovereignty, and risk inflaming tensions. Trump\u2019s rhetoric frames the deployments as a necessary response to rising crime, while critics argue the data shows crime is falling and the actions serve political and immigration\u2011enforcement agendas. The potential use of federal troops in major cities would trigger legal challenges under the Posse Comitatus Act and could set a precedent for future domestic military involvement in policing. The controversy highlights a broader strategy by the Trump administration to assert federal authority over Democratic\u2011leaning urban centers, raising concerns about civil liberties and state\u2011federal power balances.",
