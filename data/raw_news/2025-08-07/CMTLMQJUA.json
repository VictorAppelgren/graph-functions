  "title": "With \u2018Freakier Friday,\u2019 Manny Jacinto Becomes a Reluctant Leading Man",
  "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s still not easy to see people who look like me who are leading men,\u201d says Jacinto, who stars as Lindsay Lohan\u2019s love interest in the legacy sequel. \u201cThere\u2019s this negative talk that\u2019s constantly in my head like, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t be doing this. This isn\u2019t worth fighting for.\u2019\u201d",
  "content": "When asked to list a few of his favorite leading men, Manny Jacinto has no problem rattling off names: Dev Patel, Pedro Pascal, Steven Yeun, his childhood favorite, Keanu Reeves. \u201cGuys who have not only done great work, but have created work for themselves\u2014those are the guys that I aspire to be,\u201d says Jacinto, looking summery in a white T-shirt and baseball cap while sitting in front of a sunny window in his California home.\n\nFor a long time, Jacinto\u2014a Canadian actor born in the Philippines\u2014didn\u2019t consider himself a part of this coalition. Why? \u201cI mean, the lack of people that looked like me when I was growing up,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cEven to this day, it\u2019s still not that easy to see people who look like me who are leading men.\u201d\n\nAfter playing lovable, dim-witted Jason Mendoza on NBC\u2019s The Good Place from 2016 to 2020, Jacinto did more supporting work in the first season of Hulu\u2019s Nine Perfect Strangers, as well as comedic indies like I Want You Back and Cora Bora. He was largely cut from 2022\u2019s Top Gun: Maverick, a move that rankled legions of Jacinto fans. \u201cEspecially within the Filipino community, so many families go into the Navy and are super proud,\u201d he says now. \u201cAnd I think they want to be represented as well.\u201d\n\nBoth successes and setbacks reinforced Jacinto\u2019s idea that he\u2019d never quite be cast as the main character. \u201cYou start to ingrain ideas of what the world is supposed to be. So when there aren\u2019t that many guys who look like me in media,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s this innate feeling\u2014this negative talk that\u2019s constantly in my head like, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t be doing this. This is stupid. This isn\u2019t worth fighting for.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat all changes in Freakier Friday, a sequel to 2003\u2019s Freaky Friday that reunites Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan as body-swapping mother Tess and daughter Anna. Jacinto plays Eric, the widowed British chef Anna falls for\u2014and, as luck would have it, the father of Lily (Sophia Hammons), the teenage archnemesis of Anna\u2019s daughter Harper (Julia Butters). \u201cMan, am I that old now?\u201d the 37-year-old actor thought upon receiving the role. \u201cI was having a bit of a midlife crisis. But I have gotten to that point where I can play a young dad, so it was eye-opening. I\u2019m not a father in real life yet, but it was good practice. It could take a couple more years.\u201d\n\nLike millions of millennials, Jacinto grew up watching Lohan\u2019s movies. But when he revisited Freaky Friday as an adult, he realized something: \u201cThis did not age well,\u201d says Jacinto. Alongside director Nisha Ganatra, he saw Freakier Friday as an opportunity to right \u201churtful stereotypes\u201d of the Asian community that appear in the 2003 movie. \u201cThat was the first thing that we talked about. We wanted to make sure that we don\u2019t follow those same tropes and have some cultural respect,\u201d he says. \u201cI had nothing but trust that we would stay away from those stereotypes.\u201d\n\nThe sequel ups the ante by conjuring a four-way body switch involving Anna, Tess, Harper, and Lily. Jacinto\u2019s Eric is meant to be the calm in that storm. \u201cYou just wanted to find a husband character that felt grounded, that has heart, with those small moments of comedy sprinkled in,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a huge compliment that [Ganatra] would trust me, because I didn\u2019t know if I believed that myself.\u201d",

      "text": "She has yet to reach high school, but 13-year-old Julia Butters is already building the career of any actor\u2019s dreams. At the age of 10, she stole scenes opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time\u2026in Hollywood. It was on that set where Butters would first meet Steven Spielberg, who cast her as a proxy for his eldest sister in his memoir film, The Fablemans.\n\u201cI saw Steven walking around the valet [at Universal Studios]. I waved to him through the window, he waved to me, and I was freaking out,\u201d Butters tells Vanity Fair during a recent Zoom. \u201cThat was my only interaction with Steven Spielberg ever, and I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, that\u2019s the closest I\u2019m ever going to get to him.\u2019\u201d\nHer prediction didn\u2019t age well. Just a handful of years later, Spielberg and Tony Kushner\u2019s script, emblazoned with the Amblin Entertainment logo, came her way. \u201cI was so excited,\u201d Butters says. \u201cI remember just being like, \u2018Don\u2019t blow it. You gotta try your best. You gotta try your hardest. We have to make this worth it.\u2019 And it turned out to be worth it.\u201d\nAfter securing the role of Reggie, inspired by Spielberg\u2019s real-life sister Anne, Butters had just one question: \u201cIs there a monkey in this movie?\u201d The actor had watched Spielberg, a 2017 HBO documentary about the legendary filmmaker, which recounts the time his mother spontaneously brought a pet monkey home. \u201cI had this joke on set where that was what made me want to do the movie,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the deal\u2014if there was a monkey, I would work on it.\u201d And how was it sharing the screen with a capuchin monkey? Says Butters, \u201cCrystal was such an incredible actress.\u201d\nSpielberg\u2019s love of his sister is clear throughout The Fabelmans, shown through details and observations too specific to be made up\u2014including her likening the family\u2019s Northern California move to being \u201cparachuted into the land of the giant sequoia people.\u201d Although often in the periphery, Reggie\u2019s protectiveness over her mother, Mitzi (played by Michelle Williams), breaks through. During a camping trip, she shields her inebriated mother, dancing by the fire in a transparent nightgown, from prying eyes. And after learning of her parents\u2019 split, she observes that it must be difficult for their mother to be \u201cloved by someone who worships\u201d her as their father does.\n\u201cShe feels a responsibility to be kind of the mother of the family while her mom is out playing and dancing and having fun and living life,\u201d Butters tells me of Reggie. \u201cHer mother has such a way about her\u2014this innocence, it\u2019s like a breath of fresh air. She feels youthful and young and happy. She just radiates such a glow. Reggie really wants to protect that and keep that fire lit.\u201d\nButters, who plays Reggie from ages 13 to 16, grew similarly attached to her onscreen Fabelmans family\u2014Williams as free-spirited mother Mitzi, Paul Dano as by-the-numbers father Arnold, fellow sisters Natalie (Keeley Karsten) and Lisa (Sophia Kopera), and Gabriel LaBelle, who plays the Spielberg-inspired character of Sammy. \u201cWe all built a safe space where you can say what\u2019s on your mind if you\u2019re feeling anxious or sad or happy,\u201d Butters says. \u201cAnd I think that was really important with such an intense set,\u201d adding of her younger costars, \u201cWe were all geeking out over the fact that we had made our dreams come true, working with Steven.\u201d\nWhen I ask Butters if she had jitters about meeting the real-life Anne, who would, after the period depicted in the movie, go on to cowrite and produce Big, starring Tom Hanks, she pauses. \u201cI get nervous about everything, so that\u2019s kind of a funny question.\u201d Butters, who played a kid with obsessive-compulsive disorder on the ABC sitcom American Housewife, says she struggles with her own anxieties, which made their own appearance on the set of The Fabelmans.\nOne day, a scene involving Reggie and Sammy quickly bantering while washing dishes was placed in front of Butters, who was in the thick of schoolwork, just 30 minutes before it was meant to be filmed. \u201cI was having trouble getting it out on set,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI got super anxious because I was on a Steven Spielberg set and I really wanted to do the best I could. So of course when I couldn\u2019t get it, I got frustrated with myself. And I beat myself up to the point of shaking.\u201d\nHer scene partner, LaBelle, pulled her aside. \u201cTell me what I can do to help,\u201d he said. After a long conversation, LaBelle offered Butters Michael Caine\u2019s Acting in Film: An Actor\u2019s Take on Movie Making to help ease her racing mind. \u201cI definitely cherished that day for a while,\u201d she remembers. \u201cHe was able to get [my anxiety] away from me, and make me feel safe on set, and cared for.\u201d That scene was eventually cut, but she now looks back on that day not with embarrassment, but as the time \u201cI established a bond with my brother.\u201d\nButters keeps that book in her \u201cSpielberg bin\u201d alongside a drawing the director made while coloring on set with the kids, and a pine cone she found mid-filming. (She wasn\u2019t allowed to keep her character\u2019s period-accurate eyewear.) Butters stores away mementos from all of her movies, including this year\u2019s big-budget Netflix thriller The Gray Man and her upcoming project, Queen of Bones, in which she stars alongside Martin Freeman and Jacob Tremblay.\nHaving worked with two of cinema\u2019s most celebrated directors before getting her driver\u2019s license (or permit, for that matter), one can\u2019t help but sneak a few Tarantino-versus-Spielberg questions into the conversation. Of the Once Upon a Time\u2026in Hollywood set, Butters says, \u201cThere were food fights at lunch, and it was a lot of fun. It was an environment that felt like a lot of high school buddies reuniting,\u201d as opposed to The Fabelmans, where the cast had more of a \u201cquiet, tender relationship.\u201d She adds of the two auteurs: \u201cThey\u2019re very similar in the way that they have such a clear vision of what they would like, and they don\u2019t give up.\u201d\nButters hasn\u2019t reached the MPAA-mandated age to actually see Tarantino flicks, although she was allowed to watch most of her own film with him, which she calls \u201ca masterpiece.\u201d The actor has, however, delved deep into Spielberg\u2019s filmography. \u201cI love Jaws, for sure,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I would say Jurassic Park. I think those are my top two.\u201d\nBeing a child actor in the era of social media can be tricky, Butters says. But the key is to differentiate between both identities. \u201cI really try to let it be known that being a child [and] actor are two different things,\u201d she explains with the polish of someone decades older. \u201cWhen I\u2019m a child, I\u2019m a child. I have friends. I\u2019m able to go outside and touch some grass. I\u2019m not always busy. I\u2019m able to have little moments to myself, and with my friends, and with my family. But I\u2019m still an actor. And while I\u2019m still a minor, I like to be treated like a professional and not a kid.\u201d\nFor Butters, The Fabelmans\u2019 most lasting legacy may be her relationship with the real-life Anne. They first met in the woods, while shooting the family\u2019s fateful camping trip. \u201cI remember she just hugged me for almost a minute. We didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d says Butters. \u201cIt was a very beautiful moment.\u201d Months later, at the Toronto International Film Festival premiere, where the film would win the highly coveted People\u2019s Choice Award, they held hands during specific scenes.\nAnd in between those milestones, Anne gifted the actor with what has become her most treasured trinket. \u201cOn the wrap day, she gave me her high school ring from 1967,\u201d Butters recalls. \u201cShe told me that she was wearing this ring when everything went down in real life. I guard it with my life. And I wear it all the time. It\u2019s such an honor.\u201d\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\nGeorge Clooney and Adam Sandler, Together at Last\nParamount\u2019s Fiery Backlash\nAmanda Knox Even Shocked Amanda Knox\nThe Demise of a Hamptons Dream\nWhen Hollywood Almost Killed James Baldwin\nHow Princess Diana Became a Fashion Icon\nThe Photo Shoot That Changed Grace Kelly Forever\nWhat I Witnessed Inside an ICE Women\u2019s Prison\nWhat Queen Elizabeth Really Thought of Harry and Meghan\nFrom the Archive: Dating Jeffrey Epstein"

      "text": "To his friends and family, he is Pepelo, Pipi, Pedders, and Peds. Years ago, on a movie set, someone started calling him Pepsi, which he loved. Fans on the internet famously refer to him as Daddy or Zaddy, meaning he\u2019s a handsome, stylish older man they can imagine dominating them in a way they would not object to. In a 2022 video for Vanity Fair, part of the magazine\u2019s Lie Detector series, he laughed off the nickname. \u201cDaddy is a state of mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m your daddy.\u201d He was being playful, but his eye contact with the camera was so transfixing that some observers only heard the second sentence of that statement. Bella Ramsey\u2014his young costar on The Last of Us, the show that truly catapulted him to stardom\u2014disliked the \u201cdaddy\u201d label the minute it was affixed to their friend: \u201cI felt worried for him. I want to protect him from that whole joke of becoming the internet\u2019s daddy. I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want everyone to refer to you as that and see you as that. You\u2019re so much more.\u2019\u201d Ramsay calls him Pedge.\nFor simplicity\u2019s sake, I am going to call him Pedro Pascal.\nOver lunch in London, Pascal is a grand raconteur who tells stories with his hands and uses funny voices and loves to swear and drink cocktails and murder a cheese plate. He doesn\u2019t take himself too seriously. At the same time, he\u2019ll press right up against the sad and raw and confusing parts of being alive. His insides are on his outsides. He cries easily. He laughs loudly.\nPascal tells me about his \u201cgive up\u201d years, when he was a struggling actor in New York decimated by the sudden death of his beloved mother, Ver\u00f3nica. At night he\u2019d return from whatever restaurant or bar job he hadn\u2019t yet been fired from to the apartment in Brooklyn he couldn\u2019t afford. However depressing his life, his pit-bull-mix rescue, Gretta, would meet him excitedly at the door. Gretta\u2019s silhouette was intimidating enough that Pascal could walk her at 3 a.m. to deposit his crumpled wad of tips into a Chase ATM without fear. \u201cShe saved my life, that dog, because she gave me someone to go home to,\u201d Pascal says, searching through the Gretta album on his phone to show me pictures.\n\u201cIn my 30s I was supposed to have a career,\u201d he says. \u201cPast 29 without a career meant that it was over, definitely.\u201d Feeling hopeless, Pascal started researching other professions. But whenever he came close to bailing on his dream, friends and family would step in. \u201cWhen Pedro would say, \u2018I\u2019m going to nursing school\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to be a theater teacher,\u2019 it was just like \u2018No, no, no, no! You\u2019re too good!\u2019\u201d says his older sister, Javiera Balmaceda, now a producer at Amazon Studios. \u201cHe\u2019s wanted to be an actor since he was four years old. The one thing we\u2019d never allow Pedro to do was give up.\u201d\nSo Balmaceda would lend him $40 to make it through the weekend when he stopped by her office. Friends bought him groceries and took him to dinner. Neighbors helped take care of Gretta. His close friend Sarah Paulson gave him her per diem money from acting gigs and let him use her sister\u2019s car.\n\u201cBasically, everybody took care of me, well into my 30s,\u201d he says. \u201cI had angels around me the whole time.\u201d\nToday is Pascal\u2019s first day off in ages. Last week he was in Tokyo at the semiannual Star Wars Celebration, promoting next summer\u2019s release of Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu. He recently completed The Fantastic Four: First Steps and, in the morning, goes into production on the new Avengers: Doomsday. Besides the Fantastic Four reboot, he\u2019s in two other summer movies showing off interesting new angles\u2014playing the ultimate bachelor in Celine Song\u2019s romance Materialists and a small-town mayor in Ari Aster\u2019s American nightmare Eddington. Meanwhile, on the day we meet, the internet is still soggy with the grief of The Last of Us fans processing the fate of Pascal\u2019s character, Joel, a good, broken man with the saddest eyes in the world.\nThe Fantastic Four\u2019s Vanessa Kirby\u2014who plays Sue Storm to Pascal\u2019s stretchy genius, Reed Richards\u2014tells me that her friend\u2019s allure is \u201chis immense vulnerability\u201d: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much armor, so he shows himself to you straight away, and you trust that person because he\u2019s revealing himself to you in this very brave way.\u201d Spike Jonze, who directed Pascal in an exuberant Apple ad that showcases the actor\u2019s joyful dance skills, has a unified field theory about why so many people are connecting with the 50-year-old actor who struggled to get hired for decades: \u201cI think that he\u2019s what we want in masculinity.\u201d It\u2019s not just about how rugged and alive Pascal is onscreen. It\u2019s also his cheeky fun with fashion\u2014chic black shorts and lipstick-red Valentino to the Met Gala in 2023, Saint Laurent thigh-high boots to the Last of Us season-two premiere. It\u2019s how he bopped to Devo at the SNL50 concert. It\u2019s how he publicly celebrated his younger sister, Lux Pascal, when she came out as transgender in 2021 and remains a passionate advocate of the community.\nJust how smitten is the world with this actor? While hosting the Critics Choice Awards, Chelsea Handler cited 2023 as \u201cthe year everyone became horny for Pedro Pascal.\u201d A New Yorker cartoon featured a therapist reassuring his client, \u201cIt\u2019s not strange at all\u2014lately, a lot of people are reporting that their faith in humanity is riding entirely on whether or not Pedro Pascal is as nice as he seems.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d Ramsey tells me, \u201cI\u2019m relieved for humanity.\u201d\nWhen I first meet Pascal, it\u2019s in the lobby of his swanky hotel. I go in for a handshake, and he wraps me in a hug instead. On our way outside we pass a bar, and he offers to make me a cocktail, then whisks me out the front door into a waiting black BMW. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m taking you on a date!\u201d he says.\nPascal is happiest and most comfortable when the people around him are happy and comfortable, and because he is naturally so curious and warm, there\u2019s a sense of immediate safety with him. You\u2019re grateful to be in his light.\nAs we\u2019re getting in the car, Pascal mentions his mother: He was 24 when she died by suicide. My own mother died by suicide when I was 18, a fact I wasn\u2019t sure would be comfortable or appropriate to share. But then Pascal mentions that his mother got her PhD at San Antonio\u2019s Trinity University, where I was a college freshman when my mother died. The coincidence is so uncanny that I find myself spilling. Pascal immediately takes my hand. \u201cWhether we like it or not, we\u2019re bonded,\u201d he says.\nWe sit down at a Palestinian restaurant in Notting Hill. Pascal says he picked the restaurant because the last time he was here he admired the booth and the afternoon light, and thought it would be fun for us to share small plates of food. But he\u2019s posted more than once on Instagram about what\u2019s unfolding in Gaza, so I suspect he\u2019s also making a statement of support by doing an interview here. He removes his leather jacket and his green sweatshirt, stripping down to a simple white T-shirt, and lays his thick-frame glasses on the table.\nPascal turned 50 in April, a milestone he approached with irritation and dread. He cites the movie Another Woman, which made an enormous impression on him when he saw it as a porous 13-year-old. In it, Gena Rowlands delivers a bleak report on the emotional wind tunnel of finding herself in her 50s.\n\u201cStepping into my 40s felt adult and empowered,\u201d Pascal says. \u201cFifty felt more vulnerable\u2014much more vulnerable.\u201d Even when he\u2019s on top of the world? \u201cMore so, more so. What a silly thing for a 50-year-old man\u2014to have all this attention! This is such shadow-voice shit, you know what I mean?\u201d\nSo here we are, two motherless 50-year-olds drinking tequila at lunch.\n\u201cDare I say, \u2018To 50,\u2019 \u201d I say, raising my drink.\nPascal\u2019s face is so open and so game. He leans over the table and gives my glass a merry clink. \u201cAbso-fucking-lutely,\u201d he says. And off we go.\nHe was nine months old when his parents fled Chile to escape General Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship and eventually settled in San Antonio. Pascal\u2019s mother was a 22-year-old political refugee, with two children, studying child psychology. (\u201cSo, yeah, I became kind of a guinea pig,\u201d says Pascal.) On days when she didn\u2019t have a babysitter, she\u2019d drop him off at the movie theater. He remembers being seven and in heaven, able to squeeze in two and a half showings of Poltergeist before his mom returned for him. At home he\u2019d reenact scenes of being sucked into the closet or slide across the kitchen floor. Balmaceda tells me, \u201cWhen our parents got cable, the HBO song would come on and Pedro would run around the house yelling, \u2018A movie is coming! A movie is coming!\u2019\u201d\nPascal\u2019s preferred home base in life is the fourth row of a movie theater. He remembers a family film night dedicated to Steven Spielberg\u2019s The Color Purple. He sat at a distance from his family as usual, preferring to be close to the screen. But then he started crying so loudly when Whoopi Goldberg\u2019s Celie was being separated from her sister that his mother had to collect him and help him catch his breath outside. For the rest of fifth grade, he carried a copy of Alice Walker\u2019s novel around like it was the Bible.\nIf his parents recognized the artistic sensitivities of their son, it didn\u2019t affect their expectations. \u201cBeing immigrant parents, they were always kind of like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever, as long as you go to a good college,\u2019\u201d says Balmaceda with a laugh. She describes their father, a fertility doctor, as very demanding. \u201cYou had to have great grades, great manners, great taste, always.\u201d\nIn middle school, Pascal\u2019s family relocated to a wealthy and conservative Orange County, California, enclave, where \u201call the palm trees are the same height.\u201d He still can\u2019t stomach going back to visit: Middle school was a horror. He was bullied \u201cfor being a weird, sensitive kid. For being an attention-hungry kid. For being in love with the movies and theater and art.\u201d He remembers the movie Gorillas in the Mist being a lifeline. He saw it again and again in the theater, patched back together by Sigourney Weaver\u2019s performance and Maurice Jarre\u2019s dreamlike score.\nPascal honestly doesn\u2019t know if he would\u2019ve survived the bullying and abuse if his mother hadn\u2019t pulled him out of his local school system and found him a school for the arts. He got his license and the keys to Ver\u00f3nica\u2019s Volvo. He and his new best friend, Grace, would drive into LA and dance their faces off at raves. Drugs were everywhere. Pascal remembers being 16 and taking acid and calling his mother to check in and let her know he was going to spend the night out. \u201cAnd she sighs and goes, \u2018Oh.\u2019 And that was not normal. And I was like \u2018Wh-why?\u2019 and she said, \u2018Oh, no, I was just hoping that we would all go to a movie.\u2019 I was just so drawn to that kind of maternal attention, so I said, \u2018I\u2019m coming!\u2019\u201d He rushed home and sat mute and paralyzed, tripping in the back seat as they drove to see John Sayles\u2019s City of Hope.\nPascal moved to New York City to study acting at NYU, where he immediately fell into a crowd of former LaGuardia High School performing arts students that included Paulson. \u201cNo one was more fun,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBut he was also\u2026sad. There\u2019s a well of pain that lives right behind his eyes that he\u2019s never tried to hide from, and I think it\u2019s what makes him so translucent as an actor. It was just magnetic for me as a young person and still is today.\u201d\n\u201cI was having a really hard time when I was 18, 19, 20,\u201d Pascal tells me. \u201cI was struggling really badly with insomnia. I was reading James Baldwin and watching movies like Once Were Warriors and Muriel\u2019s Wedding. I just was like an open wound to the reality of life.\u201d He pauses to smack the table with his hand, groaning and laughing at himself. \u201cIt sounds so fucking pretentious, but I felt at this crossroads of coming into an understanding of what an unjust world we live in. This world, and its lack of equanimity, is just too painful to bear. How do you live in it?\u201d\nWhen we first ordered, Pascal told our server he was trying to stay off bread because\u2014well, because he\u2019s an actor. It\u2019s still hard to accept that he can\u2019t order Shake Shack every night at 10 p.m. for dinner. The server lays a plate stacked with warm pita on the table. \u201cHey, you put the bread right in front of me!\u201d he teases. He takes a big forkful of Nabulsi cheese. He won\u2019t give up cheese. At night he dreams about Gorgonzola. Pascal asks me about where I live. What my 16-year-old loved about the movie Sinners, which he adored. What I\u2019m reading. The circumstances of my mother\u2019s death.\nPascal was 24 and living in Los Angeles when he got the phone call about his own mom. He took the first flight to Santiago. His parents had returned in 1995 with his younger brother, Nicol\u00e1s, and Lux. After the services for his mother, Pascal returned a hollowed man to pilot season, stupefied that he\u2019d once considered landing a role in a new Dark Angel series of any consequence. \u201cYou think not getting a job can break me? You can\u2019t break me, I\u2019m already broken.\u201d\nSix months after his mother\u2019s death, Pascal agreed to foster a puppy to help out a friend. The first night in his apartment, the dog jumped into bed with him. Through the thin walls, Pascal could hear his neighbors watching the indie movie High Art. He listened to the scene of Ally Sheedy\u2019s character panicking over her overdosing girlfriend, played by Patricia Clarkson, and felt the warmth of this creature next to him. He knew he was going to keep this puppy and name her after a fictional German heroin addict.\nHis grief had no place in Los Angeles, with its isolating highways and traffic and sprawl. So he went home to New York City, where he\u2019d made some headway as an actor after college, only to find that his early luck had run out. He lived in a seventh-floor apartment of an East Village walk-up. Every night he\u2019d have a cigarette on his fire escape and watch the moon rise between the Twin Towers. After 9/11, he moved to Red Hook with Gretta. Of his nursing-school plan B, he now insists he would\u2019ve made a terrible nurse: \u201cI\u2019d be a selective nurse, like I was as a waiter. I\u2019d fall in love with some patients and hate others. And that poor patient that I hated!\u201d\nThe LAByrinth Theater Company, where he started to write and direct, became an artistic lifeline. He broke into regional theater, shipping off to Oregon or Washington, DC, or Boston or Cape Cod or Lowell, Massachusetts. In 2013, Paulson, chief among the \u201cangels\u201d looking out for him, passed his audition tape for Game of Thrones along to her best friend Amanda Peet, whose husband, David Benioff, co-ran the show. And a star was born. Pascal\u2019s blisteringly charismatic turn as Oberyn Martell led him to three seasons on the DEA drama Narcos. Which led him to The Last of Us and beyond.\nPascal\u2019s beloved dog was at his side right up until that big break in Game of Thrones, when she died of old age. \u201cI think about how poor I was when I had Gretta,\u201d Pascal says. \u201cI think about when I had double shifts and I couldn\u2019t find anybody to let her out and we were living in this shithole apartment in Red Hook, and I think about the bougie life she would be leading with me now as opposed to then and I grieve, I really do.\u201d\nHe chokes back a sob, then laughs at himself for being once more overcome.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been making me cry since we fucking started talking!\u201d he tells me, shaking his fist in mock anger. \u201cDon\u2019t let me order a third drink.\u201d\nPascal wants to make sure I get dessert and suggests we walk around the block looking for something sweet. But he\u2019s also due at Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s house, which is a 45-minute drive away, for an Avengers cast \u201chomework\u201d day, and then he has evening theater plans, so he\u2019s nervous about the time and trying not to show it. He is a people pleaser. He\u2019s working on it, he tells me. I tell him I can go without dessert and suggest that he let me tag along on the ride to Downey\u2019s house so we can finish our conversation. His relief is enormous.\nAs we wait for the check, we talk about some of the realities of fame. For instance, the internet\u2019s real-time dissection of his coffee order, his vacation reading, and\u2014since, as Handler said, people of every kind are horny for him\u2014why he doesn\u2019t talk about his own personal life in the press. \u201cI always feel perplexed when I\u2019m identified in whatever form of media as a \u2018highly private person,\u2019 because that\u2019s the opposite of me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m very unprivate in my private life. I just know that personal relationships are such a complex thing to navigate even without having this enormous lens on them.\u201d As for having kids, Pascal tells me that he hasn\u2019t longed to do it, except in a very particular way: \u201cI\u2019ve had dreams of taking my kids to the movies the way my parents took me. So I guess I want a shortcut to an interesting human being who is my child who will go see something that I want to see.\u201d\nOn Instagram, Pascal is forthright about his progressive values, posting about his horror over political headlines as well as sending love to his siblings and championing his and others\u2019 projects. The week before our meeting, the UK Supreme Court has released a landmark anti-trans ruling limiting the legal definition of a woman to the basis of biological sex. J.K. Rowling, who has largely funded the UK\u2019s war on the trans community, celebrated the ruling in a cruelly glib Instagram post. Pascal, ferociously protective of his baby sister, Lux, called out Rowling\u2019s rotten glee on Instagram as \u201cheinous LOSER behavior.\u201d\nSome tried to frame it as a man trying to bully a woman into silence. \u201cBut it is heinous loser behavior,\u201d Balmaceda says. \u201cAnd he said that as the older brother to someone saying that our little sister doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d As it grew into a larger story, Pascal felt briefly like \u201cthat kid that got sent to the principal\u2019s office a lot for behavioral issues in public schools in Texas feeling scared and thinking, What\u2019d I do?\u201d But something else worried him more. \u201cThe one thing that I would say I agonized over a little bit was just, \u2018Am I helping? Am I fucking helping?\u2019 It\u2019s a situation that deserves the utmost elegance so that something can actually happen, and people will actually be protected. Listen, I want to protect the people I love. But it goes beyond that. Bullies make me fucking sick.\u201d\nIn an epic bad-faith argument, some Rowling defenders tried to turn a viral clip of Pascal taking Kirby\u2019s hand at last year\u2019s Fantastic Four panel at Comic-Con into evidence that he\u2019s presumptuous with women. \u201cWhat happened is we were both incredibly nervous going out in front of thousands of people who love this comic,\u201d says Kirby. \u201cHe wanted me to know that we were in this together, and I found it a lovely gesture and was very glad to squeeze his hand back.\u201d\nIn the movie, the superpower couple is married with a baby en route. Pascal hasn\u2019t seen the finished movie yet but says, \u201cI\u2019m getting an inkling of excitement because it seems to reflect what our common goal was, and what we want to share, which is all of our fucking hearts on a platter within this genre. You just never know if people are going to be disgusted by your heart or not.\u201d He admits that entering the Marvel universe has not been without jitters: \u201cI\u2019m more aware of disgruntlement around my casting than anything I\u2019ve ever done. \u2018He\u2019s too old. He\u2019s not right. He needs to shave.\u2019\u201d Pascal takes succor from his new Avenger friend Downey: \u201cHe\u2019s just so immediately generous and inviting that you feel like you can be afraid, you can be hungry, you can be ambivalent.\u201d And Downey speaks for many of us when he tells me, \u201cPascal\u2019s slow trajectory to becoming a household name who is on a wildly hot streak kind of reaffirms my faith in our industry.\u201d\nOn our way out of the restaurant, I ask Pascal what today\u2019s Avengers \u201chomework day\u201d will entail.\n\u201cVery good question,\u201d he says, coyly.\n\u201cWhich of the Avengers will be there?\u201d\n\u201cGood question.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now you\u2019re an Avenger?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Pascal says, laughing. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to talking about death and suicide again and not the Avengers!\u201d\nIn the car, Pascal gasps and points out the window. \u201cLook at that cemetery, isn\u2019t it gorgeous?\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t want to be buried\u2014just throw him in the ocean. \u201cFish food, fish food, fish food,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd yet, I find sometimes cemeteries are so beautiful.\u201d\nSo, yes, now we\u2019re back to talking about death.\nOn February 4, 2023, the anniversary of his mother\u2019s passing, Pascal hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time. It was a triumph. In his monologue, he choked up while honoring his parents for their courage fleeing Chile when he was a baby. Musical guest Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin dedicated \u201cFix You\u201d to Pascal and Ver\u00f3nica. Pascal\u2019s childhood hero Steven Spielberg watched the show from the wings and, a month later at the Oscars, would congratulate him on a stellar job. Paulson, who\u2019d flown in that morning to appear as the Mother to Pascal\u2019s Daddy in a sketch, stayed with him at the after-party until the sun came up.\n\u201cIt was just a night we didn\u2019t want to end,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there had been a camera on me when it was happening\u2014and there\u2019d been a slow push in\u2014it would\u2019ve shown me watching his life begin. Because he was so, so present, and having this wild time. And he had no idea that it was going so well, and with the timing of his mother and this moment in his career, it was like a rebirth.\u201d\nPascal cries talking to me about it: \u201cI just felt like my mother was there. And\u2014and I don\u2019t know what else to say. It was a complete transformation of an anniversary.\u201d\nHe also reclaimed his birthday this year. Two months after his mother died, Pascal tried celebrating his 25th birthday, but the whole night was horrible and sideways and wrong. Without making a conscious decision, he stopped acknowledging his birthday to any real extent. Friends over the years would try to cajole him into a night on the town, but the most he\u2019d agree to was being taken out for a martini or \u201cgetting high and going to see How to Train Your Dragon.\u201d\nBy the time he was 49, he felt like his body was starting to turn on him. He\u2019d injured his back on the set of Gladiator II. Then he fell down some stairs at his dad\u2019s house in Chile and dislocated his shoulder. When Handler called out his universal sex appeal at the Critics Choice Awards, he remembers with a wince, \u201cI was in a sling, I was overweight, and when the camera cut to me, I didn\u2019t think anything could be further from the truth.\u201d\nWhen Pascal started filming Materialists last spring, in which he woos Dakota Johnson\u2019s matchmaker character, he was out of the sling but still couldn\u2019t do a push-up or lift weights. \u201cIt was the oldest I\u2019d ever felt in life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the weakest I\u2019d ever felt. It was such a scary, fraudulent thing to feel like I could play somebody who was the catch of Manhattan.\u201d He seems genuinely relieved when I tell him how dashing he is in the movie\u2014and what a natural romantic lead. \u201cYou think I\u2019m hot in it? Thank God!\u201d This was his first shot at a romance, and he\u2019s curious about doing it again.\nPascal has only played a true lead once, in a 2003 stage production of Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s Lobby Hero for a small theater in Cape Cod. What would it be like, he wonders, to carry a film like one of his favorite actors, Daniel Kaluuya, did in Get Out? \u201cBut again, stepping into it at my age, it\u2019s hard for me to\u2014\u201d Pascal says, then breaks off. \u201cI ask myself, Is that realistic?\u201d He cringes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how ageist my interview is going to be, but it\u2019s what I\u2019m living!\u201d\nPascal needed to make peace with \u201ccrossing this bullshit milestone of 50,\u201d so he decided to lean in headlong, planning a multiday celebration he compares to a wedding. On April 2 he hosted an intimate dinner for family and friends at a London restaurant whose martini he knew to be a winner. All three of his siblings were there, along with his father. Lux surprised him with a slideshow of pictures of Pascal and his friends and family over the years\u2014even Gretta!\u2014that finished to the song \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Mel\u00f3n.\u201d Three separate times he tries to explain how moved he was by his sister\u2019s gift without crying. \u201cI\u2019m not like this every day, I swear to God,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cBut when you feel seen like I did that night, you feel touched by magic.\u201d\nA couple nights later the celebration continued with a banger of a party at Stone Nest, the former Limelight club in London. Pascal hired Honey Dijon, a trans woman and divine Grammy-winning DJ and fashion icon. He wore a black nylon 4sdesigns overcoat over a Protect the Dolls T-shirt, and his friends spun him around the dance floor on their shoulders. His family was there. His high school bestie, Grace. Paulson and the LaGuardia gang from New York. His best friends from college who are now doctors, lawyers, and professors. The Fantastic Four cast and other actor friends. Paulson remembers looking around the adoring, eclectic crowd and thinking, \u201cWe were once teenage nutballs running around New York and now Tom Cruise is dancing at your party. What has happened to your life?\u201d\nIn the car to Downey\u2019s house, Pascal points at the word \u201cFAITH,\u201d which someone has spray-painted on a wall. He scrunches up his face in mock disgust. He\u2019s agnostic, practically an atheist\u2014and yet. \u201cI still feel like I\u2019m being mothered sometimes. I feel her witness all around me. I don\u2019t feel like any of this right now would be happening if it weren\u2019t for her.\u201d\nThere was something magical about Mar\u00eda Ver\u00f3nica Pascal Ureta. Her firstborn son misses everything about her. Her beauty. Her smell. How funny she was, and how funny she found farts. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t get past a fart of any kind without it absolutely destabilizing her into hysterics,\u201d says Pascal. \u201cShe thought they were the most brilliant, hilarious, wonderful thing in the world.\u201d She was also \u201cvery deep-feeling, very complex, very, very out of reach in a way,\u201d he adds.\nPascal\u2019s mother tried as best she could to know her son. She read To Kill a Mockingbird after seeing the profound effect it had on Pascal in grade school. She pored over For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf, which consumed Pascal after his high school English teacher read the Lady in Red monologue. She let her 17-year-old son skip school to see a pre-Broadway production of Angels in America. When Pascal came home awestruck\u2014emotionally reorganized by what he\u2019d seen\u2014she bought herself a ticket so she could experience some of what her son felt.\nPascal has a tattoo of his mother\u2019s signature on the inside of his right wrist. I have a tattoo in honor of my mother on the inside of my left. As a goodbye outside of Downey\u2019s house, we touch our griefs against each other for a moment. Which is maybe what the movies, or literature, or theater allows us to do.\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, Pascal wrote down his wish for 2025: \u201cHeal. For real.\u201d\nWhen I next speak with Pascal, he\u2019s flush from an energizing weekend in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, where he met with the Canadian poet Anne Carson after being put in touch by the artistic director at The Shed theater in New York. Over Zoom, he says that they\u2019re in early talks to collaborate on a piece she\u2019s writing that he\u2019d perform. The stage kept his dreams of being an artist alive for so long; he wants to go home to it. He\u2019s not sure about his next film project: \u201cSee, it\u2019s over!\u201d\nAs for his literal home, Pascal rents a modest loft in Los Angeles. He\u2019d tried owning a fancy house in the Hollywood Hills for a while. But his neighbors were awful, and the claustrophobic nature of the neighborhood made him feel lonely and depressed. When COVID hit, he looked up Airbnbs and found a listing for a back house near the water where he pictured taking walks and buying a bike. He didn\u2019t expect to fall so in love with the airy little artist\u2019s den, or the owners of the front property who\u2019ve come to treat him like family. He\u2019s kept it for five years now, even though there\u2019s no real door to the bathroom, and it can feel a little like a storage unit since he travels so much.\nWhen The Fantastic Four wrapped in London, he was able to return to LA for the briefest of spells. On his desk somewhere he\u2019s got a framed print of that New Yorker cartoon, about everything riding on whether or not Pedro Pascal is really that nice. A dear friend whose mother owns a framing shop gave it to him as a gift, and her workmanship is why he kept it. I ask him whether the caption makes him nervous\u2014this semiserious idea of us needing him to be as dear in real life as his public image. \u201cI was just excited that I was a fucking illustration in The New Yorker!\u201d he tells me with a laugh. \u201cI lived in New York for 20 years! I have an instinct not to take it further than that because then I would get scared.\u201d\nOf all the performances in Pascal\u2019s now formidable career, Balmaceda singles out the monologue she saw him deliver as a sophomore in high school. It was a piece Pascal had written about a bike path near their house in Corona del Mar, a neighborhood he couldn\u2019t wait to escape. Onstage, he described how, at first, he\u2019d cross this narrow path that went over a bridge on foot, then progressed to riding over it gingerly on his bike, then with just one hand on his handlebars, and then, finally, being able to cross over with his hands in the air.\nPASCAL\u2019S GROOMING, COCO ULLRICH; MANICURE, ABENA ROBINSON; TAILOR, BEN DUFORT; SET DESIGN, MAX BELLHOUSE.

      "text": "Three years ago Tom Cruise set out to cast a new generation of magnetic, and chiseled, pilots for Top Gun: Maverick, the highly anticipated sequel scheduled to land on Memorial Day weekend next year. After scouring young Hollywood, he found his squad: Glen Powell, Jay Ellis, Lewis Pullman, Danny Ramirez, Monica Barbaro (playing the first female pilot featured in the franchise), and Miles Teller.\nCruise and director Joseph Kosinski wanted real stunts with cameras capturing actual flight patterns, so the star curated the training he wished he\u2019d had back in 1986. \u201cIn anyone else\u2019s hands, Top Gun is a CGI movie,\u201d says Powell. \u201cOnly Tom puts real actors in real planes.\u201d The aircraft were flown by pilots, but the cast were in the cockpit for such long, intense stretches that sometimes they had to do what they had to do: \u201cI peed in the plane a few times,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cI peed in the plane almost every time,\u201d says Pullman. The actors trained for three months in a progression of aircraft, then did maintenance flights for g-force tolerance. \u201cTom would go first,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cAnd then we\u2019d have to go up there and try to keep up with what he just did.\u201d\nFans of the original Top Gun\u2019s immortal beach volleyball scene will be relieved to hear that our new heroes find time to play shirtless football on the sand. The younger actors worked out and skipped carbs for months to prep\u2014and did some last-second moisturizing so their muscles would glisten. \u201cI was eventually cut off from the baby oil,\u201d says Powell. After sunset, the cast celebrated with wings, tater tots, and beer, but later learned they had to shoot the scene again. \u201cWe were devastated,\u201d Ellis says with a laugh.\nMoviegoers everywhere will thank them for their service.\nHAIR, CAILE NOBLE (BARBARO); MAKEUP, KATE LEE; MANICURE, ALEX JACHNO; GROOMING, KRISTEN SHAW (PULLMAN, RAMIREZ), SYDNEY SOLLOD (ELLIS, POWELL); SET DESIGN, COLIN PHELAN.

      "text": "Steven Yeun would have deep phone conversations with his friend Lee Sung Jin from time to time, when one day Lee brought up a theme that made Yeun\u2019s ears perk up: road rage.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just something about road rage,\u201d Yeun tells Little Gold Men, \u201cand when we got into it, it was that Spider-Man meme of a Spider-Man pointing at another Spider-Man.\u201d\nYeun and Lee (who goes by Sonny) spent about a year talking about this project, with deep conversations that roamed all the way from road rage to God. Eventually, it became Beef, Netflix\u2019s pressure cooker of a dark comedy-drama that centers on a man named Danny Cho (Yeun) who gets into a road rage incident with a stranger (Ali Wong), and the two engage in a dangerously escalating game of revenge.\nYeun and Wong were also executive producers on the series along with the creator, Lee, imbuing the story with personal touches from their own histories, like Lee\u2019s and Yeun\u2019s experiences at the Korean church. The critically acclaimed series is already garnering Emmy buzz (it\u2019s competing as a limited series), especially for Yeun and Wong\u2019s explosive performances. Here, Yeun talks about how playing Danny forced him to explore shame, if there\u2019s more of Danny\u2019s story to tell, and what has led him to a string of phenomenal onscreen performances in Nope, Minari, Burning, and more.\nVanity Fair: The chemistry between you and Ali Wong is key in this story working. Did the two of you know each other well before filming this?\nSteven Yeun: We knew each other, I guess just being Asian Americans in the business. I was on Walking Dead when her first special came out, and I remember watching it in my trailer and being so blown away. I immediately DMed her on Twitter and was like, \u201cYou're so great. Thank you for holding it down.\u201d Then we just kind of briefly met here and there. We worked on Tuca and Birdie together, but we never really got to see each other consistently. So when we were building up to do this show, it just kind of felt right from the very get and we didn't have to do a lot of chemistry things. If anything, we just had to remind each other, not explicitly but like through hanging out on set, that we actually like each other so that when we got on set and had to say the words that were written, we could just go there because we felt safe.\nThe character that was going to be opposite Danny was originally supposed to be a Stanley Tucci-kind of character before Ali came on. How did it being Ali change how you approached Danny?\nIt made Danny a little bit more flawed. For me personally, it became more difficult in a way to reason with someone like Danny, who would just go at it with Ali like that. When you're punching up, it's very clear, you feel justified. But with Ali there's so many aspects \u2014 especially between men and women \u2014 that feel like you could be punching up, you could be punching down, you could be misunderstanding each other. There's so many complex things at work that everybody just kind of becomes more gnarly.\nSince you were a part of this project before scripts were even written, what was most difficult about creating Danny?\nThis reflects a lot of my larger process as an actor is you're usually trying to deduce who someone outside of yourself, which usually leaves them in a lot of judgment. You've kind of made an archetype or an understanding of who you think this person is. You've said, \u201cOh, this is this guy. He's broken, he's fucked up, he's kind of shitty. He does reprehensible things. He's not evolved.\u201d And then you have to say, \u201coh, I'm gonna play that guy.\u201d I think the difficulty was facing the inherent shame of someone like that and in turn then having to face your own shame about whether you can really empathize with someone like this and really understand their position. That was tough at first, and it continues to be tough. That's the difficulty of shame.\nFor me, I felt like we were playing with aspects of ourselves, not explicitly Ali and me, but more as human beings. Who are we and what are we on a daily basis? Are we just like a performance every day or are we being honest and truthful about how we feel, and how we feel wronged or how we feel unsupported by society or reality?\nWas this character at all inspired by people in your real life or did you take inspiration from things you observe?\nPart of it was the Venn diagram that Sonny and I share of our experience growing up. We're both non-coastal Korean Americans who grew up in the Korean church and so there were a lot of archetypes to mine. But then, you look at your old friends or your family that you've kind of left in judgment and there's also that feeling of tender, warm love that you have for them too, in their broken humanity. We were just kind of mining from all aspects of people we know, parts of ourselves.\nSpeaking of being raised in the Korean church, I've seen lots of people posting on social media and saying that that scene where Danny breaks down in the church is such a specific experience they\u2019ve never seen so accurately captured before. What was that like filming for you?\nIt was all the feelings. I relate to that experience. We shot all the band, and the background actors \u2014 they were also people from the Korean church too, who resonated with that experience. I remember I was supposed to cry and I remember coming in to watch them do this praise song, and I was like, \u201cOoh, I feel it. I think it's gonna be a good scene. I think we're gonna get it.\u201d And they turned the cameras onto me, and asked everybody else to be quiet because we need it for sound. So everybody isolated me and I tried to get there, and I couldn't. A younger me would've panicked and just blasted through it and come with up with something, but I realized that something was wrong, so I asked for a break.\nI came back and I realized that it's because everybody stopped singing. The inherent purpose of praise or the group experience of singing, whether it be praise music or live concert, is that you can lose yourself. You don't have to hang on to your identity so hard. Danny's personal story is bleak, the one he tells himself, and I think in being able to let that go for a second, there's gotta be such a deep catharsis to that. So when I asked the background actors if they could all sing, then it was like, boom.\nTheir story ends at such an interesting place. Did you, Sonny and Ali talk about what happens to them after this show? I know Sonny has talked about a three season arc.\nWe haven't talked about it too extensively. I think from the very get, the way we pitched this was as an anthology limited series. So we did want to close that loop at the end. Certainly there's more that Danny could go through. I think there's so many places it could go that it almost feels impossible to narrow it down to one.\nThey went through so much in one season.\nYea, and on a human level, the journey doesn't stop there because you've come to some understanding. It is a continual practice to be alive. Maybe this is an origin story, who knows?\nThe three of you released a statement after hearing the reaction to David Choe being a part of the series. What was that process like for you?\nPersonally for me, I don't really care to go too much into that aspect of the show. Talking about the show is most important, but I think for us, we didn't want to leave people in mystery. We wanted to say what we wanted to say and the statement was pretty complete for us.\nI think you have incredible taste. In just the past few years you\u2019ve been in Sorry To Bother You, Okja, Burning, __Nope __and now Beef. What is your secret to saying yes to a script?\nI don't have any secrets. I am incredibly fortunate that I find myself being in positions where scripts that I didn't know existed, or stories that I didn't know existed, or directors that I didn't know knew me approach me. So, I have to lead with that I\u2019ve had a lot of luck. But for me, the thing that I always gravitate towards is \u201cis the story trying to say something?\u201d I don't even mean like, is it trying to teach something? I don't really care to teach anything. Is it trying to reflect something off of our society or off of something that I believe. I think every script thus far that I've said yes to had something that deeply resonated with me.\nYou're mentioning how people are coming to you now with their stories. When did it feel like that opportunity really opened up for you?\nI think for me it was director Bong [Joon-ho]. He really took a chance on me with [his character in Okja] K and I feel so grateful to him because he saw me when a lot of people didn't see me. Even myself, really.\nI think there were people that maybe were open to me, but I had to also have space and openness for them by saying no to a couple of the things that came right after Walking Dead. Let's be honest here: it wasn't like 10, 15, 20 things. It was like, \u201cdo you want to play like a tech CIA agent on the run?\u201d And I was like, \u201cno. I don't.\u201d If anything, The Walking Dead afforded me the ultimate privilege in feeling financially secure, amongst many other things. I'm very grateful for that experience for sure.\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\nExclusive: Inside the Celebrity Boat Trip That Was All Over Your Feeds\nThe Heartbreaking Love Story of Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson\nWhat\u2019s Going On With Marjorie Taylor Greene?\nThe Demise of a Hamptons Dream\nGeorge Clooney and Adam Sandler, Together at Last\nParamount\u2019s Fiery Backlash\nWhen Hollywood Almost Killed James Baldwin\nWhat I Witnessed Inside an ICE Women\u2019s Prison\nHow Princess Diana Became a Fashion Icon\nFrom the Archive: Dating Jeffrey Epstein"

      "text": "Spoilers follow for Top Gun: Maverick.\nOne cannot take brief snippets of red-carpet interviews with celebrities as the end all, be all of how they feel about a certain subject. But perhaps it\u2019s slightly telling that Manny Jacinto, when asked at the Top Gun: Maverick world premiere what fans should expect from the movie, answered thusly: \u201cThey can expect a lot of action, a lot of tears \u2026 a lot of nostalgia coming back and hitting them straight in the face.\u201d He\u2019s right on all that! But notably, Jacinto did not list himself, and maybe that is because \u2014 I regret to inform you \u2014 The Good Place and Nine Perfect Strangers star does not seem to have even one line of dialogue in this whole movie. Jacinto is apparently a humble dude, so let me be indignant on his behalf: Why does Tom Cruise hate Jake Jortles?\nI exaggerate, but only a tiny bit. (Note that in that same interview, Jacinto refers to the movie as \u201cthe Tom Cruise show,\u201d which could be taken as jest \u2026 or not.) Top Gun: Maverick brings back Cruise\u2019s reckless, flawless Navy pilot, Captain Pete Mitchell, for one last mission: teaching a group of 12 new pilots how to attack a uranium-refinement facility in an unnamed country (cough, Iran, cough) while evading enemy detection, missiles, and combatants. At the end of their extremely brief training, Mitchell \u2014 excuse me, Maverick \u2014 will select 6 of the 12 pilots for the apparent suicide mission based on their speed, precision, and teamwork.\nTwelve pilots demand a lot of new character development, especially when only half of those characters are going to matter in the final act \u2014 and especially when 2 of the 12 are more narratively significant than the rest. Miles Teller\u2019s Rooster is the son of Maverick\u2019s former flying partner and best friend Goose (Anthony Edwards), whose death in the first Top Gun was that film\u2019s emotional climax. In another echo, Glen Powell\u2019s Hangman is Rooster\u2019s rival, paralleling the dynamic between frenemies Iceman (Val Kilmer) and Maverick. Rooster and Hangman were always going to have more to do and say than anyone else, and Teller and Powell get some solid material. But this sequel does then take the time to develop five more pilots fairly significantly, giving them personalities, quirks, and even their own character posters as part of the film\u2019s promotion. They are Monica Barbaro\u2019s Phoenix, Lewis Pullman\u2019s Bob, Jay Ellis\u2019s Payback, Danny Ramirez\u2019s Fanboy, and Greg Tarzan Davis\u2019s Coyote. Plus Rooster and Hangman, that\u2019s seven pilots Top Gun: Maverick weaves into the story line and uses for reaction shots \u2014 and yet none is our beloved Jason Mendoza.\nThe extent of Jacinto\u2019s role in Top Gun: Maverick is basically this: You briefly see his character\u2019s military ID picture onscreen, along with those of the 11 other pilots, when Jon Hamm\u2019s Cyclone tells Maverick about his teaching gig. Then you see him walk into the bar owned by Maverick\u2019s love interest, Jennifer Connelly\u2019s Penny. And then \u2026 nothing else, really. If Jacinto has even one line or stand-alone frame, I don\u2019t remember it.\nJacinto\u2019s credited character name on IMDb is Fritz, though I don\u2019t think anyone actually uses it in the movie. The names of the other four pilots \u2014 played by Jake Picking, Raymond Lee, Kara Wang, and Jack Schumacher \u2014 aren\u2019t really mentioned out loud either. If you fall into a YouTube rabbit hole, as I did, you can learn that Picking\u2019s character name is Harvard and Schumacher\u2019s is Omaha. Wang, meanwhile, abstained from revealing hers in a recent interview, and the reporter who interviewed Lee didn\u2019t ask. An early version of the characters\u2019 call signs obtained by The Hollywood Reporter doesn\u2019t help much there, since the \u201cSlayer\u201d it describes seems to have been refashioned into Powell\u2019s Hangman, \u201cLardo\u201d might be Bashir Salahuddin\u2019s Hondo, and no one syncs up with the \u201cNordic ancestry\u201d of the character \u201cViking.\u201d All of this is to say that I want to know why screenwriters Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher McQuarrie gave Jacinto\u2019s character a name that I didn\u2019t need to spend a half-hour Googling to find but didn\u2019t give him something to actually do?\nIt\u2019s not that Jacinto was an unknown during filming, which stretched from May 2018 to June 2019. He\u2019d already broken out on The Good Place, which premiered in September 2016, and appeared alongside future Top Gun: Maverick co-stars Hamm and Pullman in Bad Times at the El Royale, which was filmed in spring 2018. But maybe how little Top Gun: Maverick is mentioned in recent profiles of Jacinto is a kind of clue; a September 2021 W magazine piece doesn\u2019t describe anything Jacinto does in the \u201cintense\u201d film. And while Jacinto\u2019s Instagram is admittedly pretty sparse, most of its 19 posts are in support of his projects, including the Prime Video romantic comedy I Want You Back, the animated TV series Hailey\u2019s On It!, Nine Perfect Strangers, and The Good Place \u2014 but no Top Gun: Maverick.\nIs there drama here? Maybe. Has Jacinto\u2019s star simply risen higher in the past four years, making him now a bigger deal than he was when he played a glorified extra? Also maybe. Either way, if you hoped to see Jacinto\u2019s charming grin, fine-tuned comedic timing, or gleaming shirtlessness during beach football in Top Gun: Maverick, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint, but none of this comes to fruition. Instead, here is a collection of screengrabs of Jacinto from every trailer or promotional clip Paramount Pictures has released in support of this film, including a scene that I think was deleted from the final cut entirely.\nIs there more Manny on the cutting-room floor somewhere? Restore those moments in the inevitable Top Gun: Maverick director\u2019s cut, damn it! For now, these will have to do.\nRelated\n- Why Are So Many Movies Suddenly About Math?\n- Manny Jacinto Didn\u2019t Find His Top Gun: Maverick Fate \u2018Shocking\u2019\n- Glen Powell\u2019s Charm Offensive Is Working"

      "text": "It\u2019s time to dust off that old electric guitar. Disney has confirmed that Freaky Friday 2 is officially in production, reuniting stars Lindsay Lohan and Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis as mother and daughter Anna and Tess Coleman. The sequel is due to hit theaters in 2025.\nX content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nFreaky Friday 2 comes over 20 years after Lohan and Curtis first swapped bodies in 2003\u2019s Freaky Friday. Directed by Late Night director Nisha Ganatra, Freaky Friday 2 gives the beloved formula \u201ca multigenerational twist,\u201d according to its official synopsis. A teen no longer, Anna now has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. \u201cAs they navigate the myriad challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might indeed strike twice,\u201d reads the logline.\nLohan and Curtis aren\u2019t the only Freaky Friday stars returning for the sequel. One Tree Hill\u2019s Chad Michael Murray will reprise his role as Jake (once a love interest for Lohan\u2019s Anna) and Mark Harmon will return as Ryan (Tess\u2019s fianc\u00e9, then new husband) in Freaky Friday 2. They\u2019re joined by Christina Vidal Mitchell, Haley Hudson, Lucille Soong, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Rosalind Chao. New faces are also getting freaky in the sequel, including The Good Place\u2019s Manny Jacinto, Never Have I Ever\u2019s Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Once Upon a Time\u2026in Hollywood\u2019s Julia Butters, and Sophia Hammons.\nLohan and Curtis\u2019s Freaky Friday was the third film adaptation of Mary Rodgers\u2019s original 1972 novel. The 2003 version grossed over $160 million at the global box office. It was adapted into a musical by Next to Normal\u2019s Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, which was filmed and released on the Disney channel in 2018. A direct Freaky Friday sequel has been rumored for years, ever since Curtis appeared on The View in October 2022 and said that she had \u201cwritten to Disney\u201d about wanting to make it.\nCurtis eventually got her wish. The Everything Everywhere All at Once star took to Instagram to post behind-the-scenes footage of herself and Lindsay. \u201cWe are freaking out because the Colemans are getting freaky again,\u201d wrote Curtis on Instagram.

      "text": "It\u2019s been 16 years since Dev Patel vaulted into the global public consciousness with his star turn in Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle\u2019s 2008 Oscar magnet. The intervening years have found Patel demonstrating virtuosic range in roles that include an Arthurian knight, a zealously earnest hotelier, and the David Copperfield. Off the screen, he\u2019s developed range too, with a curriculum vitae that now includes writer, producer, and director.\nAnd for a decade, one project has loomed largest for Patel, who appears on the cover of our 2025 Hollywood Issue: Monkey Man, his ambitious directorial debut, in which he stars as an underground fighter in rural India dead-set on avenging his mother\u2019s death at the hands of a corrupt police chief. Patel thought the film might never find its way onto screens; it languished in the Netflix queue until Jordan Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw Productions and Universal eventually acquired distribution rights.\nOn a call from Los Angeles, Patel discusses this career crescendo and what comes next.\nVanity Fair: You cowrote Monkey Man; you directed it; you starred in it. Over the course of shooting, did anything still surprise you about inhabiting the character or, more largely, about making the film?\nDev Patel: What\u2019s interesting is the age-old thing of how, as an actor, you come in quite late in the game on the process. It\u2019s more of a myopic view. You\u2019re focused on your character, your accent, your costume, your lines for the day. But it was so astonishing watching it change and evolve as this piece of writing was processed through so many different hands, and mine, whether it was a costume designer, or my DP, Sharone Meir, or via restraints in a pandemic\u2014how we shifted the entire production from India to Indonesia. Everything was surprising, I guess is what I was going to say.\nYou were a producer dealing with budget issues, a director getting scenes made. How did that change the way you worked as an actor?\nWe would get everyone else\u2019s coverage, and then the last half an hour of whatever the setup was, or at the end of the day, we\u2019d quickly flip the camera around, and I\u2019d run it cold a few times\u2014which is not the ideal scenario. The sheer physical demands of trying to maintain a physique and keep that amount of choreography crammed in your brain\u2014these are things where if you\u2019re caught not concentrating for a moment, you\u2019re going to get a whack in the face. So it was just pure adrenaline for about nine months. I felt like a man possessed.\nAnd you did accrue some broken bones on set.\nI wasn\u2019t quite Jackie Chan, but broken hands, some broken toes, and torn ligaments.\nOur first big fight scene was in this bathroom sequence. My hand broke on the first or second day of that shoot. I found a doctor online that was putting screws into bones in Jakarta. We managed to get a [medical] jet so that the insurance company wouldn\u2019t red flag it as breaking our [COVID] bubble. I came back to work the next day and we carried on. It was a way to avoid having this cast put on my hand because we wouldn\u2019t be able to afford painting it out. A baptism by fire.\nYou\u2019ve worked with brilliant directors over the course of your career. Did you phone a friend for any pointers, or were there specific techniques that you\u2019d picked up?\nI think by osmosis, naturally, I\u2019ve been really influenced by these amazing directors that I\u2019ve worked with. Danny Boyle is an absolute force of nature, and you probably feel a lot of his influence in this film. David Lowery\u2014when you get to the latter, more spiritual, slightly tangential sections, my experience on Green Knight with David seeped in there. Garth Davis, who directed Lion, is a very dear friend. He came to the rescue in my edit period because we\u2019d been picked up by a studio, and they were trying to turn the movie into something that it wasn\u2019t. He was instrumental in watching the cut and really helping me out when I was absolutely pulling my hair out.\nIt\u2019s a political movie; it deals with religion\u2014how did you deal with making sure that it remained the film that you were trying to make?\nI always knew, from day one, that I was using the genre of action as a Trojan horse to expose an audience to a world that they never would\u2019ve really experienced before. I wanted to access that John Wick audience, or the guys that watch the Raid movies.\nThe central villains of the film are political, religious figures. This is happening around the world as we speak, conflicts regarding religion and land. I started the process with a Gandhi-like approach, and by the end of it, I was more Malcolm X.\nYou\u2019ve called the film an anthem for underdogs.\nIt\u2019s in its DNA, from the stories of the process\u2014from being a movie that got dropped by a studio, and the financier was bankrupt mid-shoot, to winning South by Southwest.\nRepresentation is such a loaded word, but I wanted to make a film for young Dev, the kid that grew up watching Bruce Lee films and yearned to exist in a certain film that I never had the opportunity to. And I wanted to fill it with other actors from India that don\u2019t even get a shot out there because maybe their skin\u2019s too dark and they\u2019re not considered the typical leading men and ladies, but are incredible thespians. So to have Universal and Jordan swoop in, it was really an incredible moment.\nTrans people are often underrepresented in film; was India\u2019s hijra community always central to the idea of what the film would be?\nI\u2019ve always been struck by the hijra community. You\u2019ll sit in a rickshaw and you\u2019ll meet them walking the streets, begging between cars. With a film that\u2019s talking about religion too, there\u2019s such beautiful iconography that is so open-minded and ahead of its time in terms of talking about the duality of self\u2014that we all possess a masculine energy and a feminine energy, and that those things can coexist beautifully.\nEnter the Dragon was a gateway into acting for you. What other films, action and otherwise, fed Monkey Man?\nI\u2019m a huge Jim Carrey, Rowan Atkinson fan\u2014so those more physical comedy moments, like bouncing off the window or escaping on a three-wheeler tuk-tuk. It\u2019s like, what\u2019s the equivalent of Mr. Bean\u2019s car meets the Batmobile? That\u2019s what the tuk-tuk is. Another big influence on the film is Wong Kar-wai\u2019s work, particularly In the Mood for Love and Chungking Express, if you see the kitchens and wok fire. There\u2019s a heavy element of voyeurism in the movie, and I think Wong Kar-wai does loaded looks better than anyone in cinema.\nFirework content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nSpeaking of the little getaway car, you yourself are a fan of tiny vehicles.\nI have a Mini Cooper in Australia, and then I have a 1970s Fiat 500, an old Cinquecento, which I converted into an electric vehicle. The aesthetics of old motor vehicles\u2014the shapes, the color, even the paint\u2014they\u2019re beautiful, and they feel more unique than the stuff that\u2019s on the road right now. It makes you smile when you see it, especially when you see a six-foot-two Indian guy origamied inside.\nAre there genres besides action that you feel pulled toward in the future?\nI have a little development first-look deal, and we are spinning a lot of plates at the moment. I have a lot of projects in deep development, a few that are ready to go, one that I\u2019ll potentially direct next year. It\u2019s tonally very different. But for me it\u2019s less about the genre and more about what I\u2019m trying to say with it. All of these things are an extension of myself, in a way. People are going to be like, \u201cWait, we expected another bonkers action movie, and he\u2019s doing\u2026\u201d\nYou semi-recently made a short film called Roborovski, about the littlest hamster in the world.\nI was bored in Australia, and we came across an animation company there, so I quickly cowrote the script with my [romantic] partner, Tilda [Cobham-Hervey], and John Collee, who cowrote Monkey Man. It was about a hamster in a pet shop that doesn\u2019t get chosen. It\u2019s a Jekyll-and-Hyde thing; at night he goes on these little action missions to take out the more appealing alpha predators, the other animals in cages and fish tanks, in the hopes of being chosen. It was very silly.\nIt\u2019s all feeding into trying to acquire the vocabulary and mental tool kit to be able to do Monkey Man. The animation was the idea of framing and understanding rhythm and editing, and you get more control and you get to shot-list with an animation. In a weird way, doing a little, tiny, budget 2D-animation action sequence can really inform you when you get to the big leagues and you\u2019ve got a dozen testosterone-fueled stuntmen charging at you. How do you cover that in the right way?\nDo you think Hollywood is open to risk-taking? There\u2019s always hand-wringing about the reliance on IP, the reliance on sequels. How do you think about that?\nI\u2019ve happily been oblivious to all of those politics. Monkey Man was something where I made something outside of the system and just marched along with it and didn\u2019t accept no for an answer. The idealist in me likes to think that there\u2019s always room for fresh perspectives and new stories.\nMy teenage self would beat me over the head if I didn\u2019t ask you about Skins. Looking back, do you feel like that experience prepared you for the career to come?\nWell, Keziah\u2026! Skins was like\u2014oh boy, it\u2019s kind of like the little rash that won\u2019t go away. No, no, no. Look, man, it was amazing. You look at the guys that have come out of that\u2014Nick Hoult, Kaya Scodelario\u2014[and] it\u2019s really amazing. I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was doing when I was plucked off of the street to be in that thing. We all stay in touch. And without it, there would be no me in Slumdog, without Danny Boyle\u2019s daughter being a fan of Skins. All of these things, even up until Monkey Man, they\u2019re lily pads.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. For fashion and beauty details, go to VF.com/credits."

By Joey Nolfi Joey Nolfi Entertainment Weekly's Oscars expert, 'RuPaul's Drag Race' beat reporter, host of 'Quick Drag' Twitter Spaces, and cohost of 'EW's BINGE' podcast. Almost all of the drag content on this site is my fault (you're welcome). EW's editorial guidelines Published on April 30, 2025 10:00AM EDT 1 Comment Lindsay Lohan, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Rosalind Chao in 'Freaky Friday'. Credit: Disney+ Director Nisha Ganatra, star Manny Jacinto tell EW how the Freaky Friday sequel addresses past representation.\"There were some stereotypes that were hurtful,\" Ganatra says.\"I felt very well taken care of,\" adds Jacinto. Translating Disney's Freaky Friday for a new generation was always going to be a monumental task, but sequel director Nisha Ganatra tells Entertainment Weekly that she added one more thing to her Freakier Friday checklist: Fixi the 2003 film's \"hurtful\" representation of its Asian characters. In an interview for EW's latest cover story on the Lindsay Lohan- and Jamie Lee Curtis-starring sequel, Ganatra says the question of addressing the Disney hit's past portrayal of two integral Asian characters is \"a complicated\" one \u2014 mainly \"because the first movie is so beloved,\" but \"there were some stereotypes that were hurtful\" overall. Particularly, the early aughts comedy classic follows mother-daughter duo Anna (Lohan) and Tess (Curtis), whose squabbling catches the attention of a Chinese restaurant owner, Pei-Pei (Rosalind Chao), and her mother (Lucille Soong) \u2014 the latter of whom intervenes by serving the bickering pair a magic fortune cookie that swaps their souls into the other's body. \"I remember watching it and feeling torn, mostly about the Asian representation, and also the soundtrack that was being used\" in the scenes at the restaurant, Ganatra says. \"It was something I brought up right away when I had my first meetings with the producers. I had a moment of the presentation that was like, 'problematic Asian representation!'\" Jodie Foster turned down 'Freakier Friday' cameo: 'She's not going to do it' (exclusive) Jamie Lee Curtis reveals 1 thing that would've stopped her from doing 'Freaky Friday' (exclusive) Manny Jacinto, who plays Anna's soon-to-be husband, Eric, in the sequel, says he initially had \"concerns\" over joining the project because of how the past film represented its Asian characters in those moments. \"When I considered hopping on board, I remember watching the first Freaky Friday and being like, this did not age very well, regarding the diverse characters,\" he tells EW. \"Knowing Nisha and speaking to other people within our circles, I knew we had a captain who was very much aware of those archetypes, or those issues presented in the first one. I felt very well taken care of.\" Ganatra adds that she felt like \"we owed audiences to make it right on this one,\" so the production invited Chao and Soong back to reprise their roles, albeit in completely different fashion. Rosalind Chao in 'Freaky Friday'. Disney+ For starters, the body-swapping (which amplifies in the second film, with Anna and Tess switching bodies with Anna's daughter, Harper, and soon-to-be-stepdaughter, Lily) doesn't result from a fortune cookie; this time, Ganatra's film sets the spell in motion by the hands of a bumbling psychic played by Saturday Night Live alum Vanessa Bayer. Ganatra and writer Jordan Weiss added \"some really fun moments in there,\" including one where Pei-Pei and her mother comedically communicate, \"Do you think I have nothing better to do than solve your problems?\" as Ganatra summarizes. There's also a line about Anna wanting to braid hair \"in a non-culturally appropriative way.\" The Late Night and High Note helmer calls these \"little moments that don't betray this movie, but were satisfying for people who found hurtful moments in the last one.\" Vanessa Bayer in 'Freakier Friday'. Andrew Eccles/Disney \"It was a different time and wasn\u2019t done intentionally [in the 2003 film], but it\u2019s a real thing,\" Ganatra finishes. \"It's something I, being Asian, was super conscious of.\" Jacinto agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it would have been the same or had the same heart and charm if it was a different director,\u201d the Acolyte actor says. \u201cShe keeps it very grounded and real, but also charming and fun. That\u2019s a fine line to play, and she walks it really well.\u201d Want more movie news?

In a 20th-anniversary oral history interview on the making of the film, Chao previously resisted the thought of playing Pei-Pei. \"At first I thought, 'Oh God, I don\u2019t want to do you know, the whole Chinese [thing],'\" she told The Hollywood Reporter in 2023, later adding: \"I always try and flip the script, and I thought, 'Wait, what am I talking about?' I grew up in a Chinese restaurant. My dad really was that guy. 'Oh, look. You so handsome. I haven\u2019t seen you for a long time. You so big.'

      "text": "The news that the upcoming season of The Good Place will be its last is only a few days old, but the tributes are already flowing in for the Mike Schur-created comedy\u2014which has woven a ludicrously complex story of ethics, the afterlife, and love over its three seasons on NBC. Ending after its fourth season will allow Schur and his team to craft the finale they\u2019ve wanted all along\u2014a privilege not every show gets\u2014but also gives fans precious few remaining adventures with Michael, Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, Janet, and the most lovable Floridian of all time, Jason Mendoza.\nManny Jacinto, who plays Jason, kept mum about the imminent finale when he began talking to Joanna Robinson on this week\u2019s episode of Little Gold Men. But after news that the show was ending went public, they caught up again so the actor could talk about the \u201cgreater family-like vibe\u201d on set as the cast films their final episodes. He and Joanna also talk about the roles Jacinto might play that are worlds away from Jason\u2014from a role in the upcoming Top Gun sequel to a rom-com\u2014and how Jason Mantzoukas brings an element of chaos to the set when he appears as Derek.\nThis week\u2019s episode also includes a dispatch from Joanna from the ATX television festival in Austin, a dispatch from Richard Lawson about the Tony Awards and their after-parties, and a deep dive from Mike Hogan into the new Bob Dylan documentary Rolling Thunder Revue. Or is it a documentary? Dylan and director Martin Scorsese aren\u2019t making it all that easy to tell.\nTake a listen to the episode above, and find a transcript of the Manny Jacinto interview below. You can subscribe to Little Gold Men on Apple Podcasts, Radio.com, or anywhere else you get your podcasts.\nLet me start by asking you something that I like to ask Good Place actors, which is how much of an expert are you now in moral philosophy? And if not an expert, what is something that you\u2019ve learned from the show?\nI am definitely not an expert in moral philosophy. We\u2019ve gone through like, yeah, almost four seasons now and you think I\u2019d be teaching a class on philosophy, but no, it\u2019s so difficult. I guess I get to kind of get away with not having to know as much because of my character, if that makes any sense. I\u2019m the guy that has to bring in the fart jokes or just the jokes in general, just to make everybody laugh and take their minds off of the heavy stuff in the show. And whether it be in the show or just talking to Mike and the actors, maybe the question about what makes a truly good act, what makes a truly good person. I\u2019ve come to believe that if you can really do something good for somebody, be it a good action or you know, volunteer or something and without having to try and look good, that makes you a truly good person. Ted talks about going to Starbucks and tipping the barista and then not actually waiting for the barista to look at you before you tip them. What makes a truly good person is not seeking any reward when you do something good for other people.\nYou mentioned Jason\u2019s role on the show as sort of bringing this lightness, this adorable immaturity to a sometimes heavy sitcom. But so much of this show is about the progression of these characters, this emotional growth of these characters. What are the challenges of keeping Jason sort of like pure and childlike and fun, which we love for him to be, and see him grow along with the other characters?\nI mean, the biggest thing from the beginning has always been trying to stick to the truth. That could be interpreted in many ways, but I guess the point I\u2019m trying to get across is trying to stick toward the truth that Jason feels. To not play toward the good joke or to try and be funny, but really dig deep into what Jason really feels and, and his truth, whatever that may be. And kind of figure that out and stick to that because that way it won\u2019t come off as fake. I remember when I first started on the show, I kind of do all these crazy things and I\u2019d say the joke in a way that wouldn\u2019t really make sense, but I remember Mike coming up to me like that\u2019s great and everything, but let\u2019s just make sure that it\u2019s, it\u2019s truthful in the way you say it, because people can tell right away when you\u2019re trying to be funny or when you\u2019re trying to make them laugh. The emotion behind like the words and even within the joke, that makes it just so much more impactful. And in terms of trying to make Jason continuously grow emotionally, a big part of that is, is, is the writers. They\u2019re constantly giving me different challenges and just kind of studying how Jason went from season one to now in season four and the things that I\u2019m doing, I can see that the writers have been mindful.\nI was reading an older interview. You were talking about how maybe contrary to what it might seem onscreen, you\u2019re the most serious person on set. The reason you gave us that you are sort of afraid of losing your job, that you wanted to focus on that. Is that something that\u2019s gone away now that you\u2019re in season four and if so, when did you stop worrying that any second this opportunity might go away from you?\nOh, no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever gonna go away. It\u2019s always going to be in the back of my mind, I swear they have like a backup Jason Mendoza ready to go sometimes.\nMaybe D\u2019Arcy can just play Jason.\nI knew they shouldn\u2019t have done that episode. I hoped she didn\u2019t do that that well. She might end up taking all our jobs by the end of the day. But I think that fear itself is good, because it pushes me to do better and to be ready and to not make a fool of myself, even though my job is to make a fool of myself, which is really ironic and weird. Yeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever go away in that sense, which is a good thing\nFor you in season three, what was your favorite story line or episode for you personally to work on?\nWhen we get to go back to Florida, that\u2019s always, that\u2019s always a fun time. Last season you got to meet my dad, Donkey Doug. And then we got to play not only with Mitch Narito, who plays Donkey Doug, but also with one of my favorite human beings, Eugene Cordero, who plays Pillboi. Oh man, that day went by so fast. We just had so much fun and yeah, like I keep saying the producers keep joking that we should have our own little sitcom or spin-off or something, like the Florida Men\u2019s Project.\nI know you\u2019ve talked about how your role and Eugene\u2019s role really subvert the stereotype of a lot of the Asian characters that we\u2019ve seen on television up until The Good Place. And you\u2019ve also talked about the kind of roles you would be offered before The Good Place and how different they were from Jason. Now you\u2019re going to be in the next Top Gun movie. Are you seeing a difference in the kind of roles that are coming at you in this post-Good Place experience?\nThere is definitely this shift that\u2019s happening. I think it was yesterday that I just watched Always Be My Maybe with Randall Park and Ali Wong. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually seen a rom-com with two Asian leads, I mean other than Crazy Rich Asians, but that was just last year. There\u2019s this emergence of a diverse talent, whether it be Asian or not. It\u2019s a great time to have these diverse stories. And I am so lucky. I\u2019m so lucky to be doing this at this time because it wasn\u2019t easy for my heroes and the people that I looked up to to go through the industry during their time. There\u2019s definitely a lot more opportunities out there. It\u2019s just a matter of all these things coming together from diverse talents wanting to tell their stories to so many different outlets willing to produce these stories. I feel like everybody has either like a program or a streaming service. It\u2019s so much easier to bring stuff out there. It\u2019s the combination of things coming together that has allowed that shift to happen, and I\u2019m just so lucky and grateful to be, kind of in the middle of it all.\nI know you\u2019ve talked about not really being a comedy guy. Is there, you know, beyond, I don\u2019t know, getting to be in a Tom Cruise Top Gun movie\u2014is there an opportunity, a role, something that you'd love to do in the future that maybe people wouldn't think of as a natural fit for you from watching you in The Good Place, but something that you would like to flex into?\nAlmost anything and everything at this point. Just talking about Always Be My Maybe, I would love to do a rom-com, or a serious drama, or serious love story, like The Notebook or something. I love Jason Mendoza, he\u2019s always going to be in my heart, but I definitely want to be able to flex some different skills and use some different muscles other being the innocent, lovable dummy that he is.\nI\u2019m going to start my online campaign for you to be in the next Nicholas Sparks movie. It\u2019s going to be starring you.\nWell I\u2019ll give you 5%.\nOkay. Deal. All right. So you get to work with all these great comedians. I\u2019ve heard Jason Mantzoukas talk about how he likes to try to make people break when he works opposite them on The Good Place. Who is the hardest for you to work with and get through a scene with a straight face?\nProbably Jason! I was just listening to him on the podcast as well. When he comes into a show, he doesn\u2019t necessarily have to abide by the same rules. The producers and the writers kind of know what he\u2019s all about. With Mantzoukas, he\u2019ll come in and sometimes they mainly just hire him to just to be nuts and to come up with all these different things and not to necessarily stick to the script. So he\u2019s always coming at us with different alt lines or just different ways of saying things. And there\u2019s an unlimited supply of it because of his improvisational abilities because he\u2019s a freaking legend in that area. So when we have scenes with with Derek, we don\u2019t know what to expect. It\u2019s always a whirlwind.\nYou mentioned elsewhere that this season four is maybe a bit more emotional. The Good Place has always been an emotional show, but maybe even leaning more into the emotion than previously. I know you can\u2019t tell me anything about it and I\u2019m not here to like try to have whatever the season four surprise is spoiled for me. But I\u2019m wondering if working on something like that, working on a season four being a little bit more emotional, satisfies any of that need that you have to be in a Nicholas Sparks movie or a rom-com. Are you getting to do some of that in this season?\nOh man, maybe that\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from to be honest. Who knows? Maybe that\u2019s the reason why I wanted to consider the Nicholas Sparks world. I am so thankful to Mike and the writers. With this character in the wrong hands, you can just be super flat and go the wrong way really fast. But with these writers and with Mike and with the people that we get to work with, they\u2019ve made sure that they\u2019ve given Jason more layers. I also try to do my best to give him more layers and, and not just make him the Florida idiot, but really try and sympathize and empathize with what he\u2019s going through. And they\u2019ve been a major proponent of that, to help me kind of bring that out out of Jason Mendoza. Looking at this, using what we've done so far, I think maybe toward the middle and end, it can kind of tickle that Nicholas Sparks bone a little bit. That\u2019s funny you should mention that\u2019s where all these feelings of wanting to be, um, the next Ryan Gosling comes from.\nOr maybe the next Mandy Moore, someone dying from cancer or something. I know that you and William Jackson Harper and D\u2019Arcy and Jameela, who didn\u2019t do a ton of this like level of work before the show started, I know you referred to yourselves as like babies of the show. What has working with Ted Danson, working with Kristen Bell, working with Michael Shur, these people who have been through the wringer a bit more\u2014what\u2019s the number one thing you\u2019ve learned from these veterans?\nBe kind. That kind of just reigns throughout, that\u2019s kind of a theme, it kind of resonates throughout this whole show. There\u2019s a reason why people love working on shows by Mike Shur. The writers and the crew people and the people that have worked with him for years. Mike creates an environment that\u2019s so easy and familial. There is no ego and no divas, and you can just do your best work and you\u2019re allowed to have fun. Because of the fact that Mike is just so grounded and genuine and kind, it passes on to the leads that he chooses. With Kristen and Ted, they constantly remind themselves how lucky we are to be able to just come to work and play, and like we get fed, we get told what to do, and we get to play pretend for work. That kind of mind-set of being kind to people and you know, to be humble and genuine has has always resonated throughout these four years. It\u2019s going to be the biggest thing that I take away from the whole experience, no matter how long we go for. That\u2019s probably the biggest thing that I\u2019ve learned and continue to try and, and exemplify, be kind to others.\nThank you so much for chatting with me. I really appreciate it.\nOf course. No, thank you, Joanna. This is super fun.\nQuick note from Joanna here. Between the time that we recorded that interview and now it was announced that The Good Place would be ending, it\u2019s run after four seasons. They are currently shooting that final season now. So we were able to grab Manny really quickly between shooting scenes to give us his impressions of what it meant to have the show coming to an end and how all of that emotion around it will inform the final season. So here are his answers to those questions.\nWell, we were told like sometime last year actually, I don\u2019t know if it was in November or possibly even December, a nice little Christmas gift from Mike telling us it would be over. I think when I first got the email, we all kind of knew that it wasn\u2019t gonna go on for forever. It wasn\u2019t the type of show like The Office or Parks and Rec because there\u2019s just so much story and we burn through so much of it each episode. There is definitely a bit of heartbreak for sure. Now on set think a lot of people are definitely taking it all in and cherishing the moments with each other. There\u2019s definitely a greater family-like vibe, even more so than before because we know that it\u2019s, possibly the last time that we\u2019re going to all work together. People are definitely taking a lot more photos to try and cherish these moments and remember them. I definitely know that when, when Mike announced it as well during the FYC panel, I remember going home and being like, oh man, this is actually coming to an end. It's reminder that this is finite for all that it was worth, it was definitely a story that had an ending. And I think Mike and all of us agree that it's the best way to go out. To go out on our own terms.\nI actually really like watching, not in a morbid way, but like watching a final season of a show that is really decided it\u2019s going to end. It just feels so much more purposeful headed toward that ending. You also mentioned, you know, when you talked to me before that this was a very emotional season. How much of that emotion is tied to your own personal emotion or is it baked into the story of sort of where Mike wants to bring this all to a head?\nYeah. Like when something\u2019s coming to an end, naturally your character or the actor personally will always feel some sort of heartache some type of sadness. Especially when you love the show so much and you love working with all these people so much. I think we can\u2019t help but leak some of that sadness or heartbreak into our characters when we do it. But it\u2019ll also inform the scenes. Yeah. It\u2019s a good one! I hope it will get a better assessment than season eight of Game of Thrones. But we\u2019ll see. You can\u2019t please everybody. But I think what Mike has come up with and from what we\u2019ve heard, the general consensus is that it\u2019s definitely a great ending and a good way to go."

In a new Elle cover story, Lohan shared that she was \u201cmanifesting\u201d her comeback during the pandemic: \u201cI was like, I want to work with Netflix. I kept writing it in my journal and saying it. And then that\u2019s what happened. I was like, Oh, it\u2019d be nice to do three films with them, and then see where that goes.\u201d\nBut while the 38-year-old actor always wants to front films \u201cthat make people happy and bring people together,\u201d she is finally through with Netflix romantic comedies, at least for the moment. \u201cI love making movies for that reason\u2014for people to escape and find something that they can take into their own life and realize everything\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Lohan told the publication. \u201cBut with Netflix, I was like, Okay, now we need to be thinking about other stuff. I can\u2019t do movies like these forever.\u201d\nNext up, Lohan stars in Freakier Friday\u2014out August 8\u2014a sequel to 2003\u2019s Freaky Friday that reunites her with costar Jamie Lee Curtis. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot bringing me to the movie theaters personally right now. [Freakier Friday] is a feel-good movie, which is what I want to give people,\u201d said Lohan, who also relished getting to share the experience with her husband, financier Bader Shammas, and her son, Luai. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s the most important thing\u2014my husband, my son, and me. It\u2019s all about balance and, as I said, routine,\u201d she told Saturday Night Live\u2019s Chloe Fineman in the Elle interview. \u201cEspecially when you have a kid, routine is the most important thing. And whatever their routine is, I\u2019ve got to live by that.\u201d\nLohan said she\u2019s now ready to switch up her day-to-day by welcoming a second child. \u201cOnce you have one kid, you\u2019re like, Oh, my kid needs a kid to play with. I\u2019m like, He needs a friend\u2026. Also, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s selfish\u2014but I\u2019m like, I need more than one kid to take care of me when I\u2019m older.\u201d\nSpeaking of aging, Lohan also revealed that she\u2019s developing her own beauty line and shared some of her own secrets to looking fresh-faced\u2014from drinking lemon juice and using daily eye patches to undergoing skin care treatments like Morpheus8 (Lohan only tried it once) and injections: \u201cEveryone does Botox.\u201d\nAs for the next phase of her career, Lohan will be starring in a Hulu adaptation of Sophie Stava\u2019s debut novel, Count My Lies, Elle reports, and has some ideas for what might follow. \u201cI would love to find a dark comedy like Mean Girls. That kind of meaty, good, funny movie\u2014a smart comedy. Not a rom-com, just a straightforward funny movie,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d love to work with some dream directors. Maybe Quentin Tarantino. Also, I\u2019d love to work with Julianne Moore\u2014I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve never played her daughter. Maybe now I\u2019d be her younger sister. I\u2019d also love to work with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Maybe something Sopranos-y, since I am Italian.\u201d\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\nExclusive: Inside the Celebrity Boat Trip That Was All Over Your Feeds\nThe Heartbreaking Love Story of Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson\nWhat\u2019s Going On With Marjorie Taylor Greene?\nThe Demise of a Hamptons Dream\nGeorge Clooney and Adam Sandler, Together at Last\nParamount\u2019s Fiery Backlash\nWhen Hollywood Almost Killed James Baldwin\nWhat I Witnessed Inside an ICE Women\u2019s Prison\nHow Princess Diana Became a Fashion Icon\nFrom the Archive: Dating Jeffrey Epstein"

      "text": "In perhaps the most unpredictable race of a season chock-full of them, Jamie Lee Curtis won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Deirdre Beaubeirdre in Everything Everywhere All at Once, moments after her costar Ke Huy Quan won his own supporting-actor statue.\n\u201cI know it looks like I\u2019m standing up here by myself, but I\u2019m not, I am hundreds of people,\u201d a visibly emotional Curtis said, acknowledging the vast team behind her film. She even made mention of her long career as a scream queen and the moviegoers who supported her over the years, and emphasized, \u201cWe just won an Oscar together!\u201d\nCurtis faced stiff competition from The Banshees of Inisherin\u2019s Kerry Condon, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\u2019s Angela Bassett, The Whale\u2019s Hong Chau, and her Everything Everywhere All at Once costar Stephanie Hsu, and for weeks it was anyone\u2019s guess who would emerge victorious. Curtis thanked her Everything Everywhere collaborators and emphasized the group effort that went into her victory: \u201cWe just won an Oscar!\u201d\nCurtis mounted one of the more traditional yet unconventional campaigns. The industry vet made her way into the best-supporting-actress category for her comedic turn as Deirdre the IRS agent in Everything Everywhere All at Once, most likely buoyed by the outpouring of industry love for the best-picture front-runner. Once she nabbed the nomination, Curtis went to work, homing in on her decades-long career in Hollywood and also embracing her status as the \u201cOG nepo baby,\u201d highlighting her Hollywood lineage as the youngest daughter of Oscar nominees Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis in interviews and award speeches. At the SAG Awards, Curtis triumphed over the same lineup of competitors that she faced this evening in her category\u2014the first major sign that she was a serious threat to take home Oscar gold. Still, it was anyone\u2019s guess whether the onetime scream queen would triumph come Oscar night.\nCurtis invoked her nepo-baby status in her acceptance speech, mentioning her parents and their own Oscar nominations, and shouted to the heavens the news of her win. Despite her four decades in the industry, Everything Everywhere All at Once marks Curtis\u2019s first Oscar nomination and win.\nMore Great Oscar Season Stories\nInside the Vanity Fair Oscar Party With Everyone, All at Once\nSee Every Highlight From the Vanity Fair Oscar Party Red Carpet\nSee All the Looks From the Oscars 2023 Red Carpet\nSee the Full List of This Year\u2019s Oscar Winners\nMichelle Yeoh Makes History With Best Actress Win\nKe Huy Quan\u2019s True Hollywood Comeback\nSarah Polley\u2019s Radical Vision for Women Talking\nSee Every Photo From Mark Seliger\u2019s 2023 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Portrait Studio"
