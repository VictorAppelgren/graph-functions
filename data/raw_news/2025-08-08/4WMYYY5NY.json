Generate Key Takeaways\n\nIn an increasingly-saturated music festival market, there\u2019s still no other festival quite like Outside Lands.\n\nSynonymous with San Francisco, for the last 17 years, Outside Lands has taken over the city\u2019s Golden Gate Park and hosted iconic performances from the likes of Kendrick Lamar, The Strokes, Green Day and Chappell Roan, while injecting more Bay Area DNA into the event each year. In 2018, it became one of the first major music festivals to offer the sale of marijuana, while last year, Outside Lands added a \u201cCity Hall\u201d where festivalgoers can get legally married, an homage to the 2004 \u201cWinter of Love\u201d where San Francisco offered the first same-sex marriage licenses in U.S. history.\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\u2022 None How Republic Nabbed the Soundtrack of the Year With 'KPop Demon Hunters'\n\u2022 None Live Nation Posts Strong Second Quarter as Revenues Rise to $7 Billion\n\n\u201cThis is a like never ending art project for us is how we think about it,\u201d Rick Farman, who co-founded the festival with Bay Area concert promoter Another Planet Entertainment through his promotion company Superfly. \u201cIt\u2019s always constantly evolving. We\u2019re always looking for opportunities that make sense with culture and with our mission, which is to make a festival for the Bay Area.\u201d\n\nIn a festival landscape that faces a challenging global economy, consistent rising costs and industry consolidation, Outside Lands continues to weather the storm as one of the biggest independent music festivals in the country, a notable distinction given that most festivals of its size such as Coachella or Lollapalooza are owned and operated by corporate giants like Live Nation and AEG Presents.\n\nThe 17th edition of Outside Lands kicks off Friday, with a lineup that includes Doja Cat; Tyler, the Creator; Hozier; Gracie Abrams; John Summit; Doechii; Vampire Weekend and Beck among many others throughout the weekend. Ahead of the fest, Farman and fellow Outside Lands co-founder Allen Scott of Another Planet spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about keeping the festival new, staying independent and what a festival booking means for an artist in 2025.\n\nWhat has been the main driver in what\u2019s kept outside lands to its indie roots over all this time?\n\nScott: We started in 2008. There were five festivals that came out that year; it was the beginning of the recession. Those other festivals didn\u2019t make it past a few years; we were fortunate to come out of that class still standing 17 years later. We\u2019re in San Francisco, one of the great live music markets in the world. We punch above our weight in terms of people going to concerts. And Golden Gate Park couldn\u2019t be a better location for a festival, which adds to the draw. And a lot of festivals cater to the high school and college crowd, but we book a very multi-generational lineup, which I think helps people grow with the festival since there\u2019s always going to be something for them here.\n\nFarman: We have a lot of industry muscle on our own too. Between Another Planet and Superfly, plus with my partner Coran Capshaw [the music manager behind Red Light management], the types of people that are working on this on a daily basis are always trying to think about how we can make this better, unique, not resting on our laurels. Every year\u2019s a fresh and new festival, we don\u2019t have any sacred cows.\n\nWe\u2019re a year shy of 18 here, how has the festival changed?\n\nFarman: I think the big factor is that we\u2019ve gone deeper and deeper into what our mission is, which is making a festival that\u2019s reflective of Bay Area culture. That started with food and beverages, we\u2019ve got 50 different types of wine from all over the region. And then we were early with cannabis; we\u2019re still the only major music festival that has legal sales and consumption of cannabis. Then we launched the Dolores area a couple years ago, which expresses what\u2019s special about the LGBTQ community and history in the Bay Area. Last year we launched \u201cCity Hall.\u201d All of that helps make a really hyper-local feel.\n\nScott: I don\u2019t think you can put Outside Lands anywhere else in the world because it\u2019s so much about San Francisco and the Bay Area. That keeps it unique, we can\u2019t do this anywhere else but here.\n\nHow would you describe the state of the festival business in 2025?\n\nFarman: I\u2019d say it\u2019s still going through phases of innovation and success and failure, but it\u2019s getting more mature. This modern U.S. festival market has now been around for over 20 years and it shows. We\u2019ve seen things with lasting power and others that have come and gone. You look at the landscape and there\u2019s still new independent promoters trying to create new things. I think it\u2019s large when you look from a macro perspective; it\u2019s strong.\n\nScott: Certainly the costs. Since COVID, costs have gone up over 50 percent, and ticket prices have not been able to keep up with that. So we\u2019ve had to be creative with sponsorships, more premium experiences so that we could keep the GA price down. And as we\u2019ve gotten bigger, it\u2019s also about keeping a unique lineup in the festival landscape. But cost is the biggest obstacle.\n\nHave your costs been more from production or the rising cost of booking talent?\n\nScott: It\u2019s both. It\u2019s more expensive for artists to tour, so their fees go up. Since we started, platinum tickets on tours are more common. When they use platinum tickets, they make more on their touring shows, and therefore they want more on the festival. But really the biggest bump has been the production costs, whether that\u2019s security, fencing, bathrooms, it\u2019s across the board.\n\nIf the top-tier artists that help draw audiences can get more from platinum tickets on a tour, what\u2019s the value add for them at festivals now?\n\nScott: Let\u2019s be clear, artists are still making more money at a festival than on routed dates. There\u2019s a lot of costs they save for a festival date in addition to getting paid substantially more. That said, when we\u2019re at that level, we\u2019re at an interesting place in an artist\u2019s career. They might be an arena artist, but they\u2019re not quite a stadium artist. And the fact that they can go and play in front of 60,000 people is something that\u2019s enticing to them.\n\nFarman: Beyond that, I think the value prop of playing a festival is the same, maybe even more so than it\u2019s ever been, because of the ability to break through in some capacity with audiences. We saw that last year with some of these pop artists, these festival dates are important for building audiences for these young stars who are rising up.\n\nHow do you think Outside Lands will continue to evolve?\n\nFarman: I think you see every year that we\u2019re always trying to find new things. \u201cCity Hall\u201d was a huge success last year. We added a new stage this year, the Duboce Triangle, because we had an opportunity to put more programming into the festival. There are always new things that people are engaging with, especially in a dynamic city like San Francisco. And so it\u2019s always going to give us an opportunity to speak to our audience in a way that\u2019s current and progressive.\n\nScott: We\u2019re doing it as much for ourselves as for the audience. We want to curate the most interesting and dynamic lineup that we could put together each year. We want to keep things fresh and not get complacent.\n\nBest of The Hollywood Reporter\n\u2022 None From 'Party in the U.S.A.' to 'Born in the U.S.A.': 20 of America's Most Patriotic (and Un-Patriotic) Musical Offerings\n\u2022 None Most Anticipated Concert Tours of 2025: Beyonc\u00e9, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar & SZA, Sabrina Carpenter and More\n\nSign up for THR's Newsletter.

      "text": "Like many music festivals \u2014 Lollapalooza and Coachella among them \u2014 last weekend\u2019s Outside Lands, held in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate park, adopts the now standard three-day schedule: 100-plus established and up-and-coming bands (ranging from the Queen-lite rock of Muse to the ecstatic dance-happiness of Girl Talk), loads of outsider art, and a billowy cloud of familiar smelling smoke and sweat coming off a field full of youthful revelers which numbered in the tens of thousands.\nBut what sets Outside Lands apart is its food: not content with the typical festiness of do-it-yourself burritos and greasy pizza, the organizers bring a slew of the Bay Area\u2019s best restaurants to serve up menu selections curated specifically for the music gathering, making Outside Lands not just a must-go destination for rockers, but gourmands and gluttons too. Of course, with the upswing in quality comes an urge for pretension (especially among an already snooty indie rock crowd), so we\u2019ve paired some of Outside Lands\u2019 best dishes with a few of the festival\u2019s most notable performances.\nThe restaurant: Andalu, a Mission tapaseria voted best in its district by Citysearch and praised by the New York Times, San Francisco Magazine, and Bon Appetit.\nThe dish: A succulent, salty crispy mac & cheese, gooey like cheese sticks but dippable into a sweet sauce via their crunchy breaded exterior.\nBest paired with: John Fogerty, whose nostalgic song selection (including Creedence Clearwater Revival classics like \u201cBorn On The Bayou\u201d and \u201cFortunate Son\u201d) and hey-there-look-at-me cheese charmingly transported the polo field from the heart of San Francisco to somewhere in the middle of the Kansas state fair.\n|\nNamu\u2019s Korean Tacos |\nThe restaurant: Namu, a family operated, Eastern-leaning wood-lined ode to California cuisine.\nThe dish: Korean tacos, wrapped not in tortillas but in crispy nori, and stuffed with a perfect combo of rice, a spicy, miso-tasting sauce, and your choice of chicken or short rib.\nBest paired with: Little Dragon; not only are the two options small and Asian, but both are capable of a big punch \u2014 the tacos via their salty, briny seaweed exterior and the band through singer Yukimi Nagano\u2019s relentless onstage energy.\nNext: Corn and pequillo peppers\n|\nSalumeria\u2019s corn and pequillo peppers |\nThe restaurant: Salumeria by Flour and Water, whose Italian specialties are revered for their perfect bread-and-pizza dough.\nThe dish: Corn and pequillo peppers \u2014 a simple-sounding, spot-hitting, alarmingly buttery midday snack.\nBest paired with: SF\u2019s rootsy Vetiver, whose Sutro Stage set in the waning part of Saturday afternoon was both comfortable and zesty, although if you were to catch any part of frontman Andy Cabic\u2019s excellent beard in your food, it wouldn\u2019t seem quite so tasty.\n|\nAsqew Grill\u2019s chicken skewer |\nThe restaurant: Asqew Grill, a four-location chain that couples skewers of meat with appropriate starches.\nThe dish: A doused-in-sauce BBQ chicken skewer, with what seemed to be a pound of garlic mashed potatoes.\nBest paired with: Surprisingly, the psychedelic rockers MGMT, who could have used a little pep in their step; though songs like \u201cElectric Feel\u201d sounded great, they seemed to be missing something \u2014 just like the too-dry chicken, which unfortunately didn\u2019t come with the roasted corn it\u2019s skewered with in-stores.\n|\n4505 Meats\u2019 cheeseburger |\nThe restaurant: 4505 Meats, an insanely revered burger-and-dog stand in the San Francisco Ferry building that offers butcher classes and to-go fried chicharrones.\nThe dish: The cheeseburger, a thin, fatty patty between two nearly over-grilled buns, with creamy gruyere cheese and a Thousand Island-meets-tahini special sauce.\nBest paired with: Arcade Fire. It\u2019s easy to be skeptical when everyone loves something. It\u2019s nice to admit they\u2019re all right.\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"

      "text": "Throwing a big bash for the Fourth of July and need a themed playlist?\nThe Hollywood Reporter has rounded up a list of songs about the good ole U.S.A., from Woody Guthrie\u2019s \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d to Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the USA.\u201d\nHowever, not all of them are exactly patriotic or positive in their view of America and its citizens. Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d is often misunderstood as a nationalistic anthem (it actually was intended to draw attention to the negative effects of the Vietnam War), while Green Day\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d is a criticism of the American media.\nRead on for more, and click here to see a list of Hollywood\u2019s most patriotic movies.\nThis list was originally published in 2015.\n-\n\u2018God Bless the USA\u2019\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m proud to be an American/ Where at least I know I\u2019m free/ And I won\u2019t forget the men who died/ Who gave that right to me/ And I gladly stand up/ Next to you and defend her still today/ \u2018Cause there ain\u2019t no doubt I love this land/ God bless the USA\u201d\nPerhaps the most patriotic song on this list, \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d is a staple at fireworks shows on the Fourth of July. It also continues to be performed by Lee Greenwood himself on a national level at various events, including at the 2017 and 2025 presidential inaugurations of Donald Trump, the Republican National Convention and various Trump rallies.\nTrump and Greenwood also have become friends, with the two teaming up to sell the \u201cGod Bless the USA Bible\u201d last year.\n-\n\u2018Back in the U.S.A.\u2019\n\u201cWhere hamburgers sizzle on an open grill night and day/ Yeah, and a juke-box jumping with records like in the U.S.A.\u201d\nThe song\u2019s lyrics were reportedly based on Chuck Berry\u2019s return to America following a trip to Australia, where he witnessed the poor living standards of Australian Aborigines.\n-\n\u2018Surfin U.S.A\u2019\n\u201cYou\u2019d see \u2019em wearing their baggies/ Huarachi sandals too/ A bushy bushy blonde hairdo/ Surfin\u2018 U. S. A.\u201d\nThe summer song makes reference to multiple American surf spots, including Del Mar, Swami\u2019s and Trestles. Interestingly, only one member of The Beach Boys, Dennis Wilson, actually surfed.\n-\n\u2018This Land Is Your Land\u2019\n\u201cFrom California, to the New York Island/ From the Redwood forest, to the Gulf Stream waters/ This land was made for you and me\u201d\nWoody Guthrie wrote the song to combat what he believed to be an unrealistic and overly romanticized interpretation of the United States in Irving Berlin\u2019s \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d\n-\n\u2018America\u2019\n\u201cSo we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies/ And we walked off to look for America\u201d\nSimon & Garfunkel\u2019s song describes the cross-country trip of two hitchhikers, whose initial hope gives way to sadness as they attempt to find \u201cthemselves\u201d as they discover the country. The \u201cKathy\u201d referred to in the song was Kathy Chitty, Paul Simon\u2019s onetime love-interest.\n-\n\u2018American Woman\u2019\n\u201cAmerican woman, get away from me/ American woman, mama, let me be\u201d\nThe Guess Who song was conceived from a live jam during a Kitchener, Ontario, concert with the studio recording featuring the original improvised lyrics in their entirety. Though the song often is thought of as anti-American and chauvinistic, Jim Kale, the group\u2019s bassist, has said: \u201cThe popular misconception was that it was a chauvinistic tune, which was anything but the case. The fact was, we came from a very strait-laced, conservative, laid-back country, and all of a sudden, there we were in Chicago, Detroit, New York \u2014 all these horrendously large places with their big city problems. After that one particularly grinding tour, it was just a real treat to go home and see the girls we had grown up with. Also, the war was going on, and that was terribly unpopular. We didn\u2019t have a draft system in Canada, and we were grateful for that. A lot of people called in anti-American, but it wasn\u2019t really. We weren\u2019t anti-anything. John Lennon once said that the meanings of all songs come after they are recorded. Someone else has to interpret them.\u201d\nLenny Kravitz famously covered the song for the Mike Myers film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.\n-\n\u2018Born in the U.S.A.\u2019\n\u201cI was born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A./ Got in a little hometown jam/ So they put a rifle in my hand\u201d\nThough it is often misunderstood as a nationalistic anthem, Bruce Springsteen intended the song to call attention to the negative effects of the Vietnam War and how veterans were treated after they returned home.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody could imagine what [Vietnam War veterans\u2019] particular experience is like,\u201d Springsteen told Rolling Stone in 1984. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could, you know? I think you had to live through it. But when you think about all the young men and women that died in Vietnam, and how many died since they\u2019ve been back \u2014 surviving the war and coming back and not surviving \u2014 you have to think that, at the time, the country took advantage of their selflessness. There was a moment when they were just really generous with their lives.\u201d\nThe song ranked 275th on the Rolling Stone\u2019s \u201c500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\u201d\n-\n\u2018American Girl\u2019\n\u201cWell, she was an American girl/ Raised on promises/ She couldn\u2019t help thinkin\u2018/ That there was a little more to life somewhere else\u201d\nThe song was rumored to be written about a girl who died by suicide after jumping from a residence hall at the University of Florida in Gainesville, where Tom Petty grew up. The singer rebuffed those allegations.\n-\n\u2018American Pie\u2019\n\u201cWe were singin\u2018 bye-bye, Miss American Pie/ Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry.\u201d\nThis song is best known for its cryptic lyrics that have led to much speculation and a slew of interpretations. It is believed to be about the late singer Buddy Holly, who died in a plane crash and to whom Don McLean dedicated his American Pie album.\n-\n\u2018Kids in America\u2019\n\u201cNew York to East California. /There\u2019s a new wave coming I warn you. /We\u2019re the kids in America.\u201d\nThough the song says different, Kim Wilde was not actually a kid in America. She grew up in west London, the daughter of rocker Marty Wilde, who wrote the song with son Ricky.\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s head went into a fantasy, this idea of everything being better in America,\u201d Kim once said of the meaning behind the tune. \u201cOf course for his generation, that was very true. Everyone was going to drive in movies and drinking milkshakes and having hamburgers in America. We weren\u2019t doing things like that in the U.K. I think a lot of that got caught up in the lyrics \u2014 all the kids in America are having a better, more interesting, more dangerous time than we were here.\u201d\n-\n\u2018Fortunate Son\u2019\n\u201cSome folks are born made to wave the flag/ Ooh, they\u2019re red, white and blue/ And when the band plays \u2018Hail to the chief\u2019/ Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord\u201d\nCreedence Clearwater Revival lead singer John Fogerty told Rolling Stone that the song was inspired by David Eisenhower, grandson of President Eisenhower, and Julie Nixon, the daughter of President Nixon, saying, \u201cyou just had the feeling that none of these people were going to be involved with the [Vietnam] war.\u201d\n-\n\u2018American Idiot\u2019\n\u201cDon\u2019t wanna be an American idiot./ Don\u2019t want a nation under the new media.\u201d\nThe song title is a pretty good giveaway that this isn\u2019t a rousing patriotic anthem. With its scathing criticism of the American media and national values, Green Day lead vocalist Billy Joe Armstrong never intended the song to be another \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d Armstrong was inspired to write \u201cAmerican Idiot\u201d after hearing the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \u201cThat\u2019s How I Like It\u201d on his car radio and strongly disagreeing with its pro-redneck sentimentalities.\n-\n\u2018Jack & Diane\u2019\n\u201cLittle ditty about Jack and Diane/ Two American kids growin\u2018 up in the heartland\u201d\nAccording to John Mellencamp (then performing as John Cougar), \u201cJack & Diane\u201d was written about a relationship he had with a girl who lived near his hometown of Seymour, Indiana.\n-\n\u2018Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue\u2019\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s gonna be hell/ When you hear Mother Freedom/ Start ringin\u2019 her bell\u201d\nToby Keith\u2019s father\u2019s death in a car accident and the tragedy of the 9/11 terrorist attacks prompted Keith to write a song about his father\u2019s faith in the United States. Keith initially refused to record the song and only sang it live at his concerts for military personnel.\nKeith would go on to write another patriotic song about his father, 2011\u2019s \u201cMade in America.\u201d\n-\n\u2018White America\u2019\n\u201cCountry of ours, the stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect/ The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the United States\u201d\nEminem wrote the song to combat allegations from parents and politicians, including Second Ladies Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore, that he had influenced criminal behavior in young white Americans.\n-\n\u2018Party in the U.S.A.\u2019\n\u201cSo I put my hands up/ They\u2019re playin\u2018 my song/ I know I\u2019m gonna be OK/ Yeah, it\u2019s a party in the U.S.A.\u201d\nMiley Cyrus has stated that she feels that the song does not properly reflect her musical capabilities and background, citing that when the song was recorded, she had never actually listened to a Jay-Z song \u2014 an artist who is referenced in the lyrics. Still, it\u2019s become a Fourth of July staple.\n-\n\u2018Made in America\u2019\n\u201cI pledge allegiance to my Grandma/ For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana/ Our apple pie was supplied through Arm and Hammer\u201d\nOff of Jay-Z and Kanye West\u2019s Watch the Throne album, the inspirational ballad deals with themes of family, childhood and the American Dream. R&B singer Frank Ocean wrote the vocals for the track.\n-\n\u2018Pink Houses\u2019\n\u201cOh, but ain\u2019t that America/ For you and me/ Ain\u2019t that America/ Something to see, baby/ Ain\u2019t that America /Home of the free, yeah/ Little pink houses/ For you and me.\u201d\nJohn Mellencamp (then performing as John Cougar Mellencamp) has said the song is actually a critique on American life, not a celebration. The chorus (above) is meant to be sarcastic.\n\u201cThis one has been misconstrued over the years because of the chorus \u2014 it sounds very rah-rah. But it\u2019s really an anti-American song,\u201d Mellencamp has said. \u201cThe American Dream had pretty much proven itself as not working anymore. It was another way for me to sneak something in.\u201d\n-\n\u2018Independence Day\u2019\n\u201cLet freedom ring, let the white dove sing/ Let the whole world know that today/ Is a day of reckoning/ Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong/ Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay/ It\u2019s Independence Day\u201d\nIt sounds like a patriotic anthem, but it\u2019s more of an empowering message of how an a woman escaped her abusive husband after setting her house on fire \u2014 thereby getting her own \u201cindependence day.\u201d However, after it was released, many folks didn\u2019t get the meaning of the song.\n\u201cSome people just don\u2019t understand what the song is about at all,\u201d singer Martina McBride has said.\nHowever, the song has had an impact on victims of domestic violence. \u201cI started getting all these letters \u2014 handwritten letters, back in the day \u2014 from women saying, \u2018This is my song,\u2019\u201d McBride said. \u201cI got a few letters that said, \u2019I heard this song on the radio, I\u2019ve been battered for 10 years, and I left. This was the thing that made me realize that it\u2019s not my fault, that I need to make a change.\u2019\u201d\n-\n\u2018The Star Spangled Banner\u2019\n\u201cAnd the rocket\u2019s red glare, the bombs bursting in air/ Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there/ O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave/ O\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\u201d\nFrancis Scott Key\u2019s tune is, for obvious reasons, as patriotic as you can get. America\u2019s National Anthem has been sung by scores and scores and scores of famous faces at sporting events, military celebrations, graduations and much more.\nBut the most famous rendition might belong to Whitney Houston, who performed it in January 1991 \u2014 just days after the Persian Gulf War started \u2014 at Super Bowl XXV in Tampa, Florida. Due to public demand, Arista Records then released a single of her performance, with proceeds donated to the American Red Cross Gulf Crisis Fund.\nHouston said of her performance at the Super Bowl: \u201cIf you were there, you could feel the intensity. You know, we were in the Gulf War at the time. It was an intense time for a country. A lot of our daughters and sons were overseas fighting. I could see, in the stadium, I could see the fear, the hope, the intensity, the prayers going up, you know, and I just felt like this is the moment. And it was hope, we needed hope, you know, to bring our babies home and that\u2019s what it was about for me, that what I felt when I sang that song, and the overwhelming love coming out of the stands was incredible.\u201d\nAfter the September 11 attacks, Arista rereleased the song, with proceeds donated to firefighters and victims of the terrorist attacks.\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day"

Concert revenue itself reached a record-high, Live Nation said, rising 19 percent to about $6 billion year over year, while ticketing revenue for Ticketmaster rose a much more modest 2 percent to $742 million.

The annual event at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds last December generated more than $4.2 million in tax revenue for Sonoma County, supporting more than 200 jobs with $7.1 million in labor income.\nThe city of Santa Rosa had to pass a \u201ccannabis ordinance as a way to \u2018normalize\u2019 the industry within our economy,\u201d explained the city\u2019s Mayor Tom Schwedhelm in a statement to Billboard provided by Emerald Cup organizers. In September 2018, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation making it easier for counties to provide temporary permits for events with recreational use and in May, the Northern Nights festival became one of the first music fests to legally allow cannabis sales and consumption in its 21+ Tree Lounge area.\nBringing cannabis to Outside Lands, the highest-grossing festival in the U.S. reported to Billboard Boxscore in 2018, is a major milestone and was approved by regulators just two days before the opening of the event, which is being produced by Another Planet Entertainment.\nCannabis company Moxie will sell single-use cannabis dabs for sale for $10 at Grass Lands, Outside Lands\u2019 fenced-off cannabis section, while KIVA will be offering enhanced chocolates, gummies and mints. In total, 28 cannabis companies will participate in Grass Lands, which will have its own curated stage for comedy, music and cooking.
