      "feedback": "This draft has solid cross‑source anchoring and useful numeric anchors, but to reach world‑class quality it needs a tighter, 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, invalidations, and timing windows, plus a sharper causal chain from policy/market signals to portfolios and valuations; it should also reconcile conflicting macro figures and keep a laser focus on the horizon. Actionable edits in one paragraph (compact, but comprehensive): (1) Build a formal 3–6 month scenario tree (Base, 1–2 Alternatives, plus a watch-list) with precise timing: T0–2 months for fiscal/ debt-news cadence and Medicaid work‑requirement signaling; 2–4 months for AI/automation productivity prints and Pacaso expansion milestones; 4–6 months for Medicare/Medicaid changes to constrain or validate policy offsets; (2) articulate a clear causal chain: GOP policy timing and debt dynamics affect rates and inflation, which shape equity/credit risk and flows into AI/wealth platforms (Range), co‑ownership platforms (Pacaso/mogul/Gameflip), and health‑tech/DAR monetization (HeartSciences); (3) quantify the macro/micro levers with source-backed ranges and reconciliations: debt impact estimates vary (Range’s $2.4T over 10 years vs Fox/Whatley framing of roughly $4T; present a band and cite both); downstream impacts on growth, tax receipts, and deficits; AI productivity claims (Range: 1–1.5% annual GDP uplift) should be treated as scenario inputs, not baselines; Pacaso: $1.3T US vacation-home market baseline and 21% annual co‑ownership growth, with 10 new destinations and global expansion to 1.8T in vacation‑home markets; HeartSciences: $32B ECG market by 2034 and Medicare reimbursement starting 2025; UAS jobs rising 97% (712 in 2015 to 1,400 in 2025) with $105,912 average pay; Douglas tires: 40k–60k miles typical lifespans, 50k warranty, and 36 ft stopping-distance gap vs premium—use these as conditioning inputs for consumer expenditure signals; (4) add explicit invalidation triggers: Medicaid work‑requirement rules blocked or delayed; debt trajectory surprises (range of ±0.5–1.5 percentage points in GDP growth); AI productivity prints weaker than 0.5% or vertical sector lag; Pacaso/HeartSciences regulatory setbacks; (5) tighten integration and coherence: show how a positive policy shock or AI productivity surprise could lift equities via growth/discount-rate channels while a debt‑surge‑driven shock could widen credit spreads; (6) sharpen watch‑list signals and confidence: debt path revisions (CBO), Medicaid rule outcomes, AI productivity data releases, Pacaso international expansion milestones, HeartSciences FDA/coverage progress, and UAS data collection improvements; (7) ensure source discipline: attribute each data point to its IDs (EPJYXB7DX for RNC/policy, UPV3X2MQ6 for Pacaso/Range, ILYC1M41F for Barista FIRE / investment angles, FOM34PUWA for UAS, V8TEZOR8R for tires) and explicitly acknowledge any cross‑source conflicts with a bracketed reconciled range or conditional language (e.g., range-bound debt impact; Range’s productivity scenario vs CBO baseline); (8) trim any overly generic statements and replace with concrete, sourced numbers and ranges, and (9) present the final line‑up as Base case with 1–2 clearly defined alts, a short list of risks, watch‑list signals, and a quantified confidence level.",
