  "title": "China\u2019s DeepSeek Develops Advanced AI Agents",
  "description": "China\u2019s DeepSeek is developing a model that includes more advanced AI agent features. Bloomberg\u2019s Seth Fiegerman explains how this will help DeepSeek compete with OpenAI. He joins Caroline Hyde and Ed Ludlow on \"Bloomberg Tech.\u201d (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Deep sea, actually, despite the sort of volatility of April, which deep sea cause in markets, it moves slower than some of the other Chinese names working on models. But the whole point is that this is a genetic. They want something that goes beyond the chapel. Yeah, that's right. And I think we've all been a little bit surprised at how little we've heard from Deep Sea in the last eight months since it upended the markets. We've seen a glut of products from Chinese and US rivals. And there's a lot of speculation about what's going on behind the scenes there and other that might be facing. But what we've heard and reported today is that it's focus is really in trying to make a splash in the Asian market. And, you know, for viewers here, this has really been where the tech industry has shifted to in the last six months or so. Openai anthropic, Google and others are all pushing out Asian products. I think what Deep Sea is trying to do is basically build a new model that has a gentle capabilities embedded within it so that it can field more complex, multi-step tasks on your behalf with minimal intervention. Now, again, a lot of companies are trying to do this, and we are seeing very mixed range of execution here. And it seems like deep sea probably wants to make sure they put out something that will move the needle in this potentially crowded market. But the crowding really for deep sea is its popularity in China at the moment. It is still the most popular chat bot tool, but as we say, Alibaba, Tencent, they've just had a rapid rate of innovations in their models. When do we anticipate all two will come out? Yeah, so again, we don't know if this one is R2, but this model is supposed to come out before the end of the year. What's interesting though is that Alibaba, Tencent, the ones you mentioned, haven't been as active, I think, in the Asian marketplace. I mean, they're doing a lot of emerging video generation technology, a lot of more sophisticated chat bots, manners, which we and others have cover, which is originally from Chinese origin, but now they're moving to Singapore. They have made a bigger splash with Asian product. So there might be a bigger market within China and globally if Pepsi can do something competitive on the Asian front. But it's hard to say right now how much it'll be different from what's out there.",
