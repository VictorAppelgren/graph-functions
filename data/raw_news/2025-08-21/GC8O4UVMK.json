  "title": "Sorry, But Higher Education Enrollments Are Up Again",
  "description": "Despite claims that higher education was headed for doom, enrollments are up. Again.",
  "content": "To even the most casual observer, these must feel like belligerent times in higher education \u2013 surrounded by fires, besieged, and under crushing market pressures all at once.\n\nBut I bring good news, reason for hope and optimism.\n\nThose market pressures \u2013 the droning cadence of return-on-investment posturing and supposed shrinking value propositions \u2013 they were never real. Many people absolutely wanted them to be. It\u2019s become highly fashionable, and occasionally quite profitable, to make \u201cThe End is Near\u201d signs around anything and everything about traditional higher education. But unlike the current enemies at the gates, the doomsday sign-holders won\u2019t go away. In fact, most of them have been clinging to their cardboard and magic marker proclamations for going on 15 years now.\n\nBut unfortunately, the recent smoke and chaos around higher education\u2019s ivory towers have obscured what\u2019s happening in them \u2013 they are becoming more crowded.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Despite all the wrangling, chaos, and doomsplaining, enrollments in higher education have increased. Again.\n\nAccording to a new report by higher education research and marketing firm Validated Insights, \u201cAs of Spring 2025, total enrollment in higher education in the United States was up 3.2%\u201d over 2024. And, \u201cUndergraduate programs lead enrollment growth, as enrollment grew 3.5% year-over-year.\u201d Enrollment in graduate programs grew 1.5% year-over-year, the report says.\n\nGrowth was concentrated, the report found, among 2-year degrees and non-degree programs, but even enrollment in the much-maligned bachelor\u2019s degree was up \u2013 1.1%. Further, it says, \u201cPublic institutions continue to dominate the aggregate enrollment landscape,\u201d posting a robust 3.7% enrollment increase from Spring 2024 \u2013 even though overall enrollment in this sector remains 1.8% below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nFor private schools, the ones that are supposed to be under breaking point strain, the report found that their enrollments were up too \u2013 gaining 1.8% over last year. More importantly, private schools have rebounded from the pandemic more quickly and are now a full 3% above their 2020 enrollment benchmarks.\n\nIt\u2019s not just enrollees who are showing up. According to the report, applications are up too. \u201cFirst-time [undergraduate] applications in the 2024-25 Academic Year [were] 4.3% above 2023-24 levels.\u201d The report adds that, \u201cApplication volumes have grown every year since the 2020-21 Academic Year.\u201d\n\nIn any normal environment, these types of sustained enrollment gains across nearly all sectors would be big news, even celebrated. But, as mentioned, this is nowhere near a normal environment in higher education. To switch metaphors, our attention is so focused on the dangerous mudslide that we\u2019re missing the mountain. We\u2019re even confusing one for the other. The mudslide is real, the mountain is good \u2013 thank you very much.\n\nIt's not all wine and roses. The report shows another troubling increase in enrollments at for-profit institutions. \u201cEnrollment at for-profit institutions grew 3.7% year-over-year in Spring 2025. As of Spring 2025, for-profit enrollment is 18.3% higher than it was in Spring 2020.\u201d Even for a mountain, it\u2019s a condition that forecasts a problem.\n\nThe report from Validated Insights isn\u2019t new data, it\u2019s a convenient compilation of enrollment information from multiple sources. But it paints a compelling picture and includes some interesting points beyond the higher enrollment trends.\n\nThere is a perception that online college offerings are growing so much as to become the new normal, and, as a result, that they will crowd out traditional, in-class, on-campus education. But one interesting point from the report shows that maybe that\u2019s not quite accurate.\n\nYes, online higher education programs are growing. That\u2019s no surprise. But these online programs are heavily, nearly entirely, concentrated among adult students and at open-access institutions, and in non-degree programs. Long-term, that\u2019s probably not great. Right now, the concentration of online delivery is so strong that, according to the report, just 4% of traditional undergrads (aged 18-21) were studying exclusively online, while nearly two-thirds (63%) of adult students were.\n\nAnother no-surprise, but no surprise in the report related to online programs is that online enrollments are growing in health fields. Eleven percent of students in health programs were studying online in 2021. That percentage is now 17%. No surprise. Meanwhile, it is a surprise that online enrollments in STEM fields \u2013 science, technology, engineering, and math \u2013 are down in that time. In 2021, 35% of STEM students were in online programs. By 2024, it had dropped below one in four (24%).\n\nBut the growing enrollment is the key finding. Or at least it ought to be, especially for those who have been predicting massive, even existential market swings in higher education. Listen to the market, they say.\n\nWell, in higher ed, the market is definitely speaking. Quoting the report\u2019s author Brady Colby, Head of Market Research at Validated Insights, \u201cThe biggest takeaway from our report is that, if you believe people shop with their feet, more and more people are finding their way to higher education opportunities, clearly seeing value in those choices. And not just in workforce or online career training either. Public university enrollments and traditional degree program enrollments are growing too.\"\n\nThat\u2019s right. Despite wildfires, mudslides, and every conceivable type of manufactured and intentional threat, students are finding their way past all that, to the gates of higher education, even traditional colleges, asking to be let in. The fires and flare-ups are hard to ignore. But increasing applications and increasing enrollments tell us that, at least in the eyes of the buyers, very little has happened to the value of college.",

  "summary": "A report by higher education research and marketing firm Validated Insights has found that enrollment in higher education in the US has increased again, with a 3.2% rise over 2024. The report found that undergraduate programs led the growth, with graduate programs seeing a 1.5% increase year-over-year. The growth was mainly concentrated among 2-year degrees and non-degree programs, while public institutions saw a 3-7% increase from Spring 2024. For-profit institutions also saw a significant increase in enrollment, with for-profit enrollment increasing by 18.3% from Spring 2020. However, the report highlighted a worrying increase in enrollments at for-profits, indicating a potential issue for the future of higher education. There are also concerns that online college offerings are becoming more prevalent due to their growing popularity.",
  "shortSummary": "Despite the challenges and market pressures of higher education, growth rates are steady, driven by intense competition among online and on-demand programs.",

      "text": "Ten years ago this past July, former Harvard Business School professor and notable author Clayton Christensen, the father of the idea of disruptive innovation, published a very influential book in higher education, \u201cThe Innovative University.\u201d\nNo one really seemed to notice it had been ten years.\nIt should have been an important higher education milestone though because, just about two years after his book came out, about seven and a half years ago now, Christensen started to draw additional headlines with his predictions of massive college closures. He later refined the prediction to say that half of colleges would be disrupted out of business in ten or 15 years. He later said it would be closer to nine years than ten.\nAnd although that timeline of nine years or ten years is not specifically in his book, the foundation of the prediction is. Christensen and his co-author, Henry J. Eyring, believed that a very large number of colleges were running on unstainable business models and poised for \u201cdisruption\u201d \u2013 mostly by the technology savvy for-profit colleges. In the book\u2019s final pages Christensen and Eyring refer to colleges as if taking a line from the popular \u201cPurge\u201d movie series. \u201cThe time for pruning has come,\u201d they wrote.\nAbout three years ago, about halfway to Christensen\u2019s decade mark, I checked in on the numbers to see if we were on track to the Christensen prediction that half our schools would be gone. We weren\u2019t. Then, we were not really anywhere close.\nSo, now ten years on from publication of book and about three quarters of the way to Christensen\u2019s ten year prediction, it\u2019s time to revisit \u2013 to see where we are. Is there any evidence that online learning and the supposedly cheaper and faster for-profit colleges will force old-guard colleges to close?\nNo.\nThere is about a year\u2019s lag in the data from the Department of Education (ED), so we can only look at the numbers through 2019-2020. But according to ED, there were 3,026 degree-granting, four-year institutions in 2012-2013, at about the time Christensen started his decade doom clock. ED says that in 2019-20, there were 2,679 \u2013 a difference of 347, or a drop of about 11% over those seven years.\nSome of that stability is sneaky. In those seven years, some two-year schools have reclassified as four year schools, upsetting the numbers. If you take all the degree-granting institutions at all levels, there were 744 fewer of them last year than there were in 2012.\nThat may feel like a ton and 744 seems like a big number.\nBut again, as was the case three years ago, the story is not the what, it\u2019s the who.\nAs was the case in 2018, the closures are almost entirely contained in the for-profit college sector. In the seven years of data in the Christensen window, the number of for-profit institutions has dropped from 1,451 to 697 \u2013 a massive decline of 754.\nIn other words, statistically, the totality of college closures we\u2019ve seen in the past seven years have been for-profit colleges \u2013 there are 754 fewer for-profits and just 744 closures of institutions of all kinds.\nAnd that means, as you statistics majors have already deduced, the number of public and non-profit colleges has actually gone up since Christensen said half would close. Public institutions, two and four-year, have gone from 1,623 to 1,625. The number of private non-profit schools went from 1,652 to 1,660.\nThere\u2019s still a little time left in that decade prediction that shook higher education but, to be clear, what we see so far is not at all what Christensen predicted.\nIn fact, in his book, he predicted precisely the opposite \u2013 that online, largely for-profit colleges would disrupt and bankrupt the others. Looking back, there\u2019s no question he thought the online, for-profit schools would be the winners, the disruptors in the great pruning to come. \u201cInvestigations of student-recruiting abuses and proposals to tighten regulatory standards slowed the for-profits, but it would be unwise to dismiss the disruptive power of their educational model, especially the use of online technology.\u201d\nHe was clear about what institutions he was talking about. \u201cThe schools most at risk are the more than 700 public and not-for-profit universities that grant graduate degrees but are not among the 200 elite research institutions,\u201d Christensen wrote.\n\u201cMany for-profit online universities,\u201d he also wrote, \u201ccan now boast of regional accreditation and federal aid access.\u201d He added that in technology and wealth, \u201ccurrent trends likewise favor online educators, particularly the for-profit ones.\u201d\n\u201cThe Innovative University\u201d cites the ability of online and for-profit colleges to hire part-time faculty, dismissible at will, as a helpful feature that would put further cost and market pressures on schools that used the more costly tenure-research professor model.\nIn the book, Christensen and Eyring also favorably examine the market successes of for-profit colleges such as the University of Phoenix and DeVry University. DeVry, they wrote, \u201coperated more than 90 campuses and served more than 90,000 students, many of them via online technology.\u201d Today, DeVry\u2019s enrollment is about 17,000. Of the University of Phoenix, they wrote that as of 2009, \u201cit enrolled 355,800 new students, roughly 150,000 more than the total enrollment of the ten campuses of the University of California.\u201d Today, its total enrollment is less than 75,000.\nTen years on, it\u2019s surprising no one has mentioned how completely backwards those predictions were \u2013 that the market actually devoured the would-be disruptors. If the trends hold for another two years \u2013 that non-profit and public schools are just fine, notably undisrupted \u2013 it will be as interesting to see if anyone else notices."

      "text": "August 2025\nHigher Ed Insights\nA review of the latest, most actionable data for higher education leaders.\nEnrollment grew 3.2% year-over-year in Spring 2025, a slight deceleration from the 4.5% growth in Fall 2024. Spring 2025 enrollment came in 1.9% above Spring 2021 enrollment.\nInternational enrollment grew 3.0% in AY 2023-24. Both HolonIQ and the Institute of International Education (IIE) project a decline in the coming years, however.\nThe list of largest programs remains relatively unchanged as the BBA is the largest bachelor's, and the MBA is the largest master's as of Spring 2025.\nWhat does the most recent higher education research tell us?\nThe stability and future of colleges and universities in the United States has been a frequent topic in public discourse. Many have been quick to declare that the rise in competition from non-institutional education providers and broader demographic trends spell doom for colleges and universities. Against these headwinds, however, total enrollment continues to grow.\nSpring 2025 enrollment data from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) Research Center's Current Term Enrollment Estimates show that aggregate enrollment in higher education grew 3.2% year-over-year to 18.4 million (an increase of 562,000 students). As of Spring 2025, aggregate enrollment sits 1.9% above Spring 2020 enrollment of 18.0 million.Enrollment growth is not evenly concentrated. From Spring 2021 to Spring 2025, undergraduate enrollment grew 1.8%. In Spring 2025 alone, however, undergraduate enrollment grew 3.5% year-over-year. At the graduate level, enrollment grew 2.6% from Spring 2021 to Spring 2025, but year-over-year growth in Spring 2025 was slightly more modest at just 1.5%.Public institutions continue to dominate the enrollment landscape, enrolling 71.2% of all students in Spring 2025. Enrollment at these institutions grew 3.7% year-over-year in Spring 2025, but Spring enrollment at these institutions has not yet surpassed Spring 2020 levels. At private institutions (both for-profit and not-for-profit), enrollment grew 1.8% year-over-year in Spring 2025. While enrollment at private institutions remains 3.0% higher than in Spring 2020, substantial financial pressure remains on these institutions, in particular. The credit rating firm, Fitch Ratings, has recently noted that the median adjusted operating margin for private institutions fell 2.0% in 2024 to the lowest level observed in a decade.Enrollment growth in Spring 2025 was also unevenly distributed across student levels.\nUndergraduate enrollment sat at 15.26 million in Spring 2025, 3.5% above Spring 2024. Graduate enrollment in Spring 2025 sat at 3.11 million, just 1.5% above Spring 2024. At the undergraduate level, volume continues to be led by the bachelor's degree, however growth is led by associate's degrees. Associate's degree enrollment sat at 4.44 million in Spring 2025, 6.3% above Spring 2024. Associate's degree enrollment has yet to fully recover from the tectonic shifts that occurred during, and immediately after the pandemic, and as of Spring 2025, this enrollment remains 7.8% below Spring 2020 levels. At the graduate level, master's enrollment sat at 1.83 million in Spring 2025, up a modest 1.1% from Spring 2024. Master's enrollment has been on a strong trajectory since the pandemic, however, and Spring 2025 enrollment in these programs sat 6.9% above Spring 2020 levels.Enrollment growth continues to be strong in non-degree programming. From Spring 2020 to Spring 2025, enrollment in graduate certificate programs grew 26.5% (the fastest observed growth), and enrollment in undergraduate certificates grew 20.1%.Similar trends can be observed in the most recent data about online students as reported by BestColleges. In their recently released report titled the 2025 Online Education Trends Report, BestCollege's reports that the percentage of online students that are enrolling in associate's degree programs grew from 18% in 2021 to 28% in 2025, and that the percentage enrolling in non-degree programs doubled from 9% in 2021 to 18% in 2025.All told, while the future of higher education remains somewhat uncertain, the most recent data paints a relatively positive picture of what has occurred recently, and points to key opportunities for higher education institutions.
