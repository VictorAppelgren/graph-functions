  "title": "Jealous of Duolingo\u2019s Social Media? The Strategist Behind It Just Shared Advice for Brands",
  "description": "Zaria Parvez, the social media manager behind the infamous green owl, explains what it takes to craft an enviable social-first brand.",
  "content": "At some point, many founders have probably said to their teams, \u201cWe need to be more like Duolingo.\u201c Over the past five years, the language education app has become the it brand on social media. The company\u2019s green owl mascot became one of the internet\u2019s main characters, reaching another stratosphere of cultural ubiquity as it starred in increasingly comical, even bizarre, videos. The content had little\u2014if anything\u2014to do with Duolingo\u2019s actual business of encouraging people to learn a foreign language, but struck a chord, becoming the model for a whole new school of thought: unhinged marketing.\n\nThat strategy all came from a single employee: Zaria Parvez. After graduating from college in 2020, Parvez joined Duolingo as its sole social media manager and remained a one-woman team until last year. Parvez, who publicly revealed herself as the social mind behind the owl a year into the schtick, announced on LinkedIn earlier this week that she was leaving Duolingo, just after the company reported 41 percent revenue growth and record profits in the second quarter. During her tenure, the company\u2019s footprint grew from 300,000 Instagram followers to 4.6 million. Twitter went from 370,000 followers to 1 million. Perhaps most impressive and enviable, the brand\u2019s TikTok catapulted from a mere 35,000 followers to 16.7 million, a growth rate of more than 45,600 percent. Business leaders admire those results, but getting there requires ample strategy. \u201cWanting to be like Duolingo is meaningless if you don\u2019t have a destination,\u201d Parvez told social media strategist Rachel Karten, who writes the popular social media and marketing strategy newsletter, Link In Bio. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, distractions will look like opportunities.\u201d\n\nParvez told Karten that with so much brand saturation on consumers\u2019 social feeds, investing in a TikTok presence or commenting on posts in character is no longer enough to stand out. To emulate Duolingo\u2019s success, Parvez said companies should worry less about creating their own mascot or copying other brands and focus on the process behind the content. That means speeding up approvals, empowering social teams to take creative control, and normalizing failure, knowing that some ideas and posts will inevitably fall flat. People assume the Duolingo strategy came from an \u201cinsane strategy deck\u201d Parez said, but really, it was just her asking her bosses: Can I try this? \u201cThere\u2019s just no shortcut,\u201d she told Karten. \u201cIf you start trying to be like every other brand, at some point, you\u2019re just no, because-ing, instead of yes, and-ing.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf brands want to embrace that spirit of experimentation, Parvez recommended companies invest in \u201cslow burn\u201d content that is less concerned with algorithms and virality and more about building a sustained community through storytelling and serialized posts, which keep users coming back, such as \u201cRoomies,\u201d the short-form show that the rewards and loyalty platform Bilt produced. \u201cThere\u2019s really something powerful about reclaiming that ritual,\u201d said Parvez. \u201cThe next big brand will be the one that unlocks that.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Parvez warned brands: \u201cDo not use social as a crutch.\u201d Instead, chief marketing officers need to remember: \u201cYour community is your insurance policy, so invest in them. Curate them. Take care of them, because you don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll need them.\u201d",
