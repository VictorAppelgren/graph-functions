      "text": "President Trump approval rating: Latest numbers show nine-point drop in one poll\nPresident Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped to near-record lows, according to a national poll \u2014 the latest in a series of surveys released this month. The Pew Research Center poll, released Aug. 14, shows Trump with a 38% approval rating, down nine points since Pew\u2019s February survey at the start of his second term. Sixty percent of respondents said they disapprove of his job performance. Pew attributes the decline to falling support from his 2024 voters and adults who didn\u2019t vote in November.\nOther recent polls show less dramatic shifts. For example, The Economist\u2019s latest poll shows a slight increase in approval, suggesting mixed public sentiment.\nHere\u2019s how Trump\u2019s approval ratings stack up across several national polls:\nThe Economist\nTrump approval rating, according to the latest from The Economist (Aug. 15, 2025):\n- Favorable: 42%\n- Unfavorable: 54%\n- Not sure: 4%\nThe latest report shows that voters believe the top three most important issues Americans are facing are inflation/prices, jobs and the economy, followed by health care. This ranking has remained steady in the past few months.\nMorning Consult\nTrump approval rating, according to the latest Morning Consult poll (Aug. 15, 2025):\n- Favorable: 45%\n- Unfavorable: 51%\nSilver Bulletin\nTrump approval rating according to Pollster Nate Silver's \u201cSilver Bulletin\u201d newsletter (Aug. 15, 2025):\n- Favorable: 44%\n- Unfavorable: 53%\nRasmussen\nTrump approval rating, according to the latest Rasmussen poll (Aug. 15, 2025):\n- Favorable: 49%\n- Unfavorable: 49%\nThe figures include 33% of U.S. voters who \"strongly approve\" of the job Trump is doing as president as well as 40% of voters who \"strongly disapprove,\" according to the report.\nNew York Times\nTrump approval rating, according to the latest New York Times poll (Aug. 15, 2025):\n- Favorable: 44%\n- Unfavorable: 53%\nPew Research Center\nTrump approval rating, according to Pew Research Center. (Aug. 14, 2025)\n- Favorable: 38%\n- Unfavorable: 60%\nQuantus Insights\nTrump approval rating, according to the latest from Quantus Insights poll (Aug. 14, 2025):\n- Favorable: 47%\n- Unfavorable: 49%\n- Not sure: 4%\nCNBC\nTrump approval rating, according to CNBC (Aug. 7, 2025):\n- Favorable: 47%\n- Unfavorable: 51%\nReal Clear Politics\nTrump approval rating, according to the latest Real Clear Politics poll (July 28, 2025):\n- Favorable: 46%\n- Unfavorable: 52%\nReuters/Ipsos\nTrump approval rating, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll (July 25-27, 2025):\n- Favorable: 40%\n- Unfavorable: 56%\nNavigator Research\nTrump approval rating, specifically regarding the public's perception of President Trump, according to the latest Navigator Research poll (July 25, 2025):\n- Favorable: 43%\n- Unfavorable: 54%\nEmerson College\nTrump approval rating, according to the latest Emerson College poll (July 25, 2025):\n- Favorable: 46%\n- Unfavorable: 47%\nGallup\nTrump approval rating, according to the latest Gallup poll (July 7-21, 2025):\n- Favorable: 37%\n- Unfavorable: 59%\n- No opinion: 4%\nQuinnipiac University\nTrump approval rating, according to the latest Quinnipiac University poll (July 16, 2025):\n- Favorable: 40%\n- Unfavorable: 54%\nNote: Polls are constantly changing and different pollsters ask different varieties of the population. These numbers were reflected as of Wednesday, Aug. 15, 2025, at 11 a.m.\nPresident approval ratings: What they measure\nA president\u2019s approval rating reflects the percentage of Americans polled who approve of the president\u2019s performance. Anything can impact a president's rating, such as legislation passed, actions and elections. According to ABC News, an approval rating doesn't just represent how well the administration is faring for the general public but could factor into the outcome of an upcoming election or how much they accomplish while in office.\nPresidential approval ratings were first conducted by the founder of the American Institute of Public Opinion, George Gallup, around 1935 to gauge public support for the president of the United States during their term. While Gallup has tracked presidential approval for 70 years, other organizations also conduct and release their own polls. Among them, Ipsos and Morning Consult.\nHow does Trump's approval rating compare to previous presidents?\n- Joe Biden (June 2021) - 56% approve\n- Donald Trump (June 2017) - 38% approve\n- Barack Obama (June 2009) - 61% approve\n- George W. Bush (June 2001) - 54% approve\n- Bill Clinton (June 1993) - 41% approve\n- George H.W. Bush (June 1989) - 70% approve\n- Ronald Reagan (June 1981) - 59% approve\n- Jimmy Carter (June 1977) - 63% approve\n- Richard Nixon (June 1969) - 63% approve\n- John F. Kennedy (June 1961) - 73% approve\nContributing USA Today network"
