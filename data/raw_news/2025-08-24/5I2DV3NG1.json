  "title": "Powerball Jackpot Hits $750 Million\u2014Here\u2019s What the Winner Could Take Home After Taxes",
  "description": "The $750 million jackpot is one of the largest in the lottery\u2019s history.",
  "content": "The Powerball lottery jackpot climbed to $750 million\u2014the tenth-largest prize in the lottery\u2019s history\u2014after no winning tickets were sold in the latest drawing, but an eventual winner would take home substantially less after taxes. The $750 million jackpot is one of the largest in the lottery\u2019s history.\n\nNo tickets were sold matching Saturday night\u2019s winning numbers (11, 14, 34, 47, 51 and Powerball number 18), so the jackpot grew once again before the next drawing Monday night. If a single ticket is sold matching each number drawn Monday, the winner could receive a jackpot of $750 million paid out in 30 annualized payments, or elect to take the lump sum of $338.6 million immediately\u2014the much more popular option. If the winner takes the lump sum, federal withholding taxes of 24% would immediately bring their winnings down to $257.3 million. Winners would also likely face the highest federal marginal tax rate at 37%, bringing the cash sum down to $213.3 million. If the winner picks the annuity, that $750 million jackpot is paid out over 30 payments for an average of $25 million, but federal taxes would reduce these to just $15.7 million. They also might have to pay state taxes on their winnings, which range from a high of 10.9% in New York to 0% in California and Texas.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nThe next drawing is scheduled for Monday night at 10:59 p.m. EDT, and can be streamed on the Powerball website. If a winner isn\u2019t selected Monday night, the jackpot will grow again before the upcoming Wednesday drawing.\n\nAlthough no winner was selected Saturday night, three people matched the numbers on all five white balls. A winner in New York and a winner in Maine will take home a $1 million prize, while a third winner in South Dakota will take home $2 million since they bought a ticket with the Power Play option for $1 more than a standard ticket. The odds of matching the five white balls, without the Powerball, are about 1 in 11.7 million, according to the lottery organizers.\n\n$2.04 billion. That\u2019s the largest jackpot in Powerball history, which was claimed by a lucky winner in California in 2022. The jackpot has climbed above $1 billion multiple times over the course of the lottery\u2019s history, most recently in 2024 when an Oregon cancer patient won a massive $1.3 billion jackpot.",

      "text": "Topline\nA single winning ticket sold in California claimed the record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot on Tuesday, giving the lucky winner a choice of receiving 30 annual payments over 29 years or a smaller lump sum up front, the most common choice for lottery winners.\nKey Facts\nThe winning ticket was sold at Joe\u2019s Service Center in Altadena, California, 10 miles north of Los Angeles, with winning numbers 10, 33, 41, 47 and 56, with a Powerball of 10.\nIf the winner chooses the lump sum, they will walk away with $997.6 million before taxes, according to the Powerball, although they\u2019ll owe the IRS a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding of $239.4 million, leaving them with $758.2 million.\nAfter that, the winner faces a federal marginal rate up to 37%\u2014which would reduce the prize by another $129.7 million, if the winner had no additional income, dependents or itemized tax deductions such as charitable giving, leaving them with $628.5 million.\nThe winner can also opt to take the full $2.04 billion over 30 annual payments of roughly $68 million, on average\u2014although that would be chopped to $42.8 million per payment after federal taxes.\nKey Background\nThe Powerball jackpot jumped from a record $1.9 billion to over $2 billion by the Monday night drawing, after 41 straight drawings without an exact winner. Tuesday\u2019s jackpot broke the previous Powerball record of $1.586 billion, which was split between three winners in California, Florida and Tennessee in January 2016. The biggest Mega Millions jackpot ever was $1.537 billion, which was claimed in October 2018, followed by the $1.337 billion jackpot in July.\nContra\nCalifornia, where the winning ticket was sold, is one of 14 states that doesn\u2019t take a cut of the prize winnings for state taxes. The highest state taxes are in Washington D.C. (10.75%), Maryland (8.95%) and New York (8.82%). Several cities also impose local income taxes, including New York City, which takes out another 3.87% in addition to federal and state taxes.\nFurther Reading\n1 winner claims record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot (ABC News)\nThe $1.9 Billion Powerball Jackpot: Odds, Taxes, Value (Forbes)"

Saephan said he bought more than 20 tickets for the drawing and even joked with his friend Chao about becoming a billionaire before the drawing was carried out. After Saephan found out they had won, he called Chao while she was on her way to work and told her \u201cyou don\u2019t have to go anymore.\u201d Saephan told reporters he was born in Laos and first migrated to Thailand in 1987, and then to the U.S. in 1994. He also said despite being born in Laos, he was not Laotian but identified himself as Iu Mien\u2014an ethnic group from Southeast Asia who partnered with the U.S. during the Vietnam War. Iu Mien people were forced to flee to Thailand after the end of the Vietnam war to avoid retribution.\nSurprising Fact\nSaephan and Chao overcame abysmal odds of 1-in-292.2 million to score the Powerball jackpot. This is slightly better than the Mega Millions jackpot\u2019s even worse odds of 1-in-302.6 million."
