      "feedback": "The draft shows ambition and a credible macro–stock lens, but its Movers & Scenarios section must be tightened to discipline: four lines exactly (2 Up, 2 Down) with a single, testable driver per line, crisp “What to watch” triggers, and probabilities anchored to explicit, source-backed thresholds; currently the lines blend multiple drivers and run long, which blurs causality and weakens falsifiability. Actionable edits: (1) rewrite each line to the exact format: Up | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, ensuring only one core driver per line and a single auditable trigger. (2) Tie probabilities to concrete, evidence-based events (e.g., a 50–150bp rate path, a specific price level or earnings/Guidance milestone, or a SNAP event like a Jackson Hole signal) and attach the exact IDs after any factual claim used to justify the probability; avoid generic “macro tailwinds” without an event-based trigger. (3) Ground every claim in first principles and a clear regime map: define Regime A/B/C in one concise framework, specify the exact regime-transition signals that would invalidate a line, and ensure the causal chain runs from policy/inflation/wage dynamics through risk premia to equity leadership (cite with IDs like 37UZC9X8I, H7Q52FKDH, NL5YYTLF2, J99EM2TPZ, RHFWI02JT as appropriate). (4) Strengthen the Quantification: replace broad statements with numbers drawn from sources (e.g., policy path/target ranges, earnings, margin data, price levels) and place those numbers in the “What to watch” field, followed by a parenthetical ID. (5) Reconcile conflicts by stating explicit cross-source points of agreement/disagreement in a compact sentence or two within the plan, then ensure the 4 lines reflect a single, coherent, testable narrative rather than divergent impulses. (6) For the Swing Trade plan, ensure the plan line is a single, standards-compliant line with Entry/Stop/Target/Risk metrics drawn from the material (e.g., ACMR price/information around 30.5–30.6, consensus target 34.76, 3–6 month horizon) and include a strict Invalidation and Trigger along with Probability and Confidence; cite the exact IDs after the factual pieces. (7) Remove extraneous, non-sourced macro prose from the Movers block and keep all critical facts tied to IDs; this will improve citation density, reduce conflicts, and sharpen decision-making signals. In short, implement a clean, event-driven, source-backed four-line Movers & Scenarios with a single, fully specified Swing Trade plan (or one Outlook if not tradable) and tighten the formatting to strict five-field lines plus one plan line, all anchored to the IDs in the SOURCE MATERIAL.",
