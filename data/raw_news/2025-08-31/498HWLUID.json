  "content": "You\u2019ve seen it all over the headlines. AI is axing entry-level jobs. Computer science graduates who\u2019ve been sold the dream of completing university and walking straight into their dream role at a Big Tech employer, are seeing their dreams shattered right before their very eyes.\n\nThe job market is relentless, and AI is making it more difficult than ever for the class of 2025 to begin their careers.\n\nUnfortunately, it takes more than entry-level skill or merely a degree to survive the market right now. You need to know what skill sets employers are specifically needing the most in the talent market right now, so you can meet their demand, become irreplaceable by AI, and make yourself indispensable.\n\nEmployers are reporting significant skills shortages and skills gaps within different markets and industries, from software development to data analytics to design, product management, marketing, and even customer success.\n\nFor example, the most critical gap within the software development field is cloud platforms, with only 0.07% of developer resumes mentioning this skill, despite 3.98% of job posts requiring it, according to Huntr\u2019s recent Job Search Trends report of Q2 2025.\n\nSimilarly, within data analytics, cloud platforms again emerged as the most significant skills shortage, hindering employers from tapping into high-skilled talent and reducing innovation.\n\nIn this article, you\u2019ll learn the top skills gaps that Huntr\u2019s report highlights, and armed with these insights, you\u2019ll also discover how to upskill in these core areas for free, so you can gain a competitive edge and do what at least 90% of job search candidates are not doing right now.\n\nThese small tweaks could make all the difference between you landing on a thick \u201crejected\" resume pile, or securing an interview and final offer, and even being chased down by employers because of your rare expertise.\n\nThe Biggest Skills Gaps Right Now\n\nAccording to Huntr\u2019s report, these are the competencies with the most significant skills shortages in the labor market right now And they\u2019re high-income skills too, with most paying lucratively in roles with average salaries of $100,000 or more (like in UX design and product management). Employers are scrambling to fill these and related roles, but aren\u2019t able to adequately fill them due to lack of access or availability of talent skilled in these very areas:\n\u2022 Administrative--Microsoft Office (employers are looking for advanced-level proficiency, especially with Copilot on the scene, not just basic email typing and PowerPoint templates)\n\nWhat\u2019s worrying about this skills gap (and you should be alarmed too) is that all of these skills can be acquired easily and inexpensively\u2026meaning you don't even need a degree to acquire them.\n\nYou can undertake intense technical training, or learn via a specialised course or bootcamp, and gain the necessary expertise which will put you way ahead of the rest who haven\u2019t had such training. (More on that below.)\n\nOne thing that strikes me the most about this list of in-demand skills, is portfolio skills, which is essentially revealing that employers acknowledge that job search candidates within the design industry, i.e. fashion, graphic design, etc., are failing to create or design portfolios in a way that truly sells them.\n\nThis is a very simple error that can easily be solved, but something that many job seekers in this field unfortunately miss. Simply not having a portfolio, or one that clearly articulates your greatest strengths and the results that you\u2019ve delivered, can stand in the way of you landing your dream job, even if you match every skill on the job description to the \"T\" and already have the necessary skills and experience they require.\n\nAnother thing that's concerning is that many job seekers I've spoken to in my coaching experience actually have the necessary skills, but fail to show it on their resumes.\n\nThere\u2019s no point having specific technical skills and power skills, but not demonstrating them on your LinkedIn profile and in your resume. Your skills are your greatest asset, so failing to include them puts you at the back of the queue, while those who\u2019ve worked hard to specialise and acquire the very skills you have will win the role you wanted, not because they are skilled more than you are, but simply because they know how to show it.\n\nNow, to help you stand out from the crowd and impress employers and even prospective clients if you\u2019re a freelancer, here are some free courses and certifications you can take to upskill in the areas listed above, whether you\u2019re a software developer, UX designer, data analyst, or other professional in the industries included in Huntr\u2019s report.\n\nOracle\u2019s Oracle University is currently holding a \u201cRace to Certification\u201d which is a challenge anyone can participate in for free to upskill, gain badges and certificates, and have a chance to win some prizes and be featured on a leaderboard. Their free courses range from AI to cloud to data. Cloud courses and certificates include:\n\u2022 and so much more.\n\nBuild and display your portfolio for free on platforms like:\n\u2022 You can also learn on LinkedIn Learning\u2019s courses (free with a trial or free to Premium members) such as Building a Portfolio With Adobe Portfolio\n\nProduct School has a range of free micro-certifications such as:\n\nMicrosoft has tons of hands-on training videos and step-by-step tutorials across all its apps, suitable for different roles including developers, start-up founders, consultants, and AI engineers. A few include:\n\u2022 Explore Microsoft Teams (because to be honest, you\u2019re still stuck using the same familiar features every day at work)\n\u2022 Get Started With OneNote For Education (more niche, nuanced application)\n\nHow To Include These Skills/Certifications In Your Resume\n\u2022 Build a portfolio of projects you\u2019ve created while learning/past projects with results including any case studies, and include this link in your resume and LinkedIn profile.\n\u2022 List only the relevant certifications, in reverse chronological order on your resume in a dedicated section near the education section.\n\u2022 Where it makes sense and enables you to stand out due to your niche, include your certification by briefly mentioning it near the top of your resume, in the skills or professional summary sections.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t wait until you\u2019ve finished; if you\u2019re still working on completing your course, include it but write a note like \u201ccurrently studying\u201d or \u201cdue to complete by XYZ\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s time to add some \u201coomph\u201d to your resume and show employers exactly what your skills are worth.\n\nCheck out my recent article, 20 Courses & Certificates To Learn High-Income Skills In 2 Hours, for ways to learn and upskill even when you\u2019re short on time.",

      "text": "Huntr Research\nJob Search Trends Report Q2 2025\nHuntr\u2019s Q2 2025 Job Search Trends Report analyzes 461k applications, 285k job ads, 59k resumes and a 455-respondent survey to reveal slower hiring cycles, surging AI adoption, widening skills gaps and shifting pay + location expectations. Dive in for data-driven insights on where the market\u2019s cooling and where candidates still hold the leverage.\nIntroduction\nThe second quarter of 2025 marked a decisive turning point in the post-pandemic labor market. Drawing on 461,000 tracked applications, 284,623 de-duplicated job listings, 59,000 resumes, and a 455-respondent survey.\nHuntr\u2019s Q2-2025 dataset shows the median time to first offer increasing by 22 percent to 68.5 days, even as the busiest 10 percent of candidates fired off 19 applications a week. LinkedIn still captured nearly four-fifths of job saves, yet Google Jobs delivered triple its callback rate, underscoring a widening gap between reach and effectiveness. Remote and hybrid roles now account for 83 percent of worker preferences, but more than half of postings omit any location guidance; evidence of mounting employer uncertainty.\nMeanwhile AI has become a mainstream ally (93 percent of seekers deploy tools like ChatGPT to help with resumes/cover letters and more) yet seven in ten still reject one-way AI interviews, reaffirming the value of human connection. Layer in rising salary ambitions (43 percent now target $100k-plus), and the revelation that half of workers stay in disliked jobs for benefits or visas, and a picture emerges of a market simultaneously cooling, fragmenting, and reforming around new power centers of tech, transparency, and talent leverage.\nHighlights of This Report\nYour quick-scan overview of the standout findings from Q2 2025\nFrom Search Insights\n- Hiring Slowdown: Time to first offer has jumped 22% since April, now taking a median of 68.5 days.\n- Post-Interview Delay: Candidates wait nearly twice as long after interviews (11 days) as they do to get them (6 days).\n- Quality Versus Quantity of Applications: While the most common path to a job offer is a targeted search of 10-20 applications, a significant group of seekers must apply to over 100 jobs to achieve the same success.\nFrom Job Search Sites Section\n- LinkedIn Still Reigns: LinkedIn captured up to 80% of job saves in H1 2025, while Indeed\u2019s share surged 65% since January.\n- Response Rate Surprise: Google Jobs leads with a 9.3% response rate, nearly 3x higher than LinkedIn\u2019s 3.3%.\n- ATS Market Shift: Greenhouse grew its lead from 23% to 29%, while Lever fell sharply from 14% to 9% in H1 2025. AshbyHQ demonstrates consistent growth, rising from 11.15% to 14.56%, positioning itself as an up and coming ATS leader.\nFrom Job Market Analysis\n- C-Suite & Tech Leadership Dominate: CIOs top the charts at $286K, while principal engineers and architects now regularly earn over $200K.\n- Advanced Degrees Pay Off: Doctorate holders earn 35% above average, with master's degrees close behind at a 29% premium.\n- AI & Engineering Strategy Skills Command Premiums: Engineering leaders earn 112% more than average, with AI strategy and technical leadership close behind.\nFrom Resume Insights\n- Depth Over Length Wins: Interviewed resumes feature richer education blurbs, stronger LinkedIn presence, and fewer but more detailed work achievements.\n- Less Is More: Successful resumes list fewer certifications and fewer skills, emphasizing focus over quantity.\n- Experience Matters: Interviewed candidates show slightly longer tenures and more distinct roles, highlighting the value of sustained, varied experience.\nHighlights for Job Search Survey Insights\n- AI Acceptance Grows: 68% of job seekers say they\u2019d accept a job offer without ever speaking to a human.\n- Mental Health Matters: 1 in 3 workers have quit a job for mental health reasons, highlighting rising burnout.\n- Free Labor Problem: Nearly half of job seekers report completing unpaid projects during the interview process.\nHow We Gathered This Data\nData for Job Search Insights\nWe mined the anonymized activity logs from Huntr\u2019s Job Tracker\u2014every application, stage change, and offer recorded by users between April 2025 and June 2025. Covering 461k job entries created by 17,733 job seekers, giving us precise timestamps to measure time-to-interview, offer velocity, and weekly application cadence.\nData for Job Search Sites\nWhenever a user saves a posting, Huntr captures the source URL. For Q2 2025, that produced \u2248364k saved jobs, which we grouped by domain to rank boards like LinkedIn or Indeed, and by ATS domains to see which systems dominate. Response rates come from users moving a saved job into \u201cInterview\u201d or beyond, an on-platform action that signals an employer callback. Our metrics in this section key off the root domain of each saved posting (e.g., linkedin.com, indeed.com). This approach cleanly captures stand-alone boards but under-represents applicant-tracking systems (ATSs) that embed their pages inside a company\u2019s own URL; for example, a Greenhouse job served at careers.acme.com/\u2026 is attributed to Acme rather than to Greenhouse. As a result, site-level popularity and callback rates favor public boards and may understate the reach of ATS platforms embedded within corporate domains.\nData for Job Market Analysis\nTo avoid double-counting identical roles posted across multiple boards or refresh dates, we deduplicated every listing at the job-title \u00d7 company level. In Q2 2025, that yielded 284,623 unique job-company combinations from the original 461,000 saved jobs. All salary, degree, skill-premium, and location analyses start with this de-duped set, then narrow further. By basing every metric on one record per employer role, we ensure our pay and demand numbers reflect distinct openings rather than repeated advertisements.\nData for Resume Insights\nFrom 59,071 resumes created in Q2 (64.3% job-tailored, 35.7% base) by 15,405 unique authors, we extracted structured fields; sections used, bullet counts, character lengths, and social links. To link resume quality with outcomes, we focused on the 37,976 job-tailored files tied to tracked applications, comparing the 1,187 that led to a self-reported interview to the rest.\nData for Job Search Survey Insights\nFinally, we fielded a 28-question web survey in June 2025, collecting 455 complete responses across industries, seniorities, and geographies. The survey supplements platform telemetry with diversity, mental health, AI sentiment, layoffs, salary expectations, and more.\nDataset Composition\nBefore diving into the findings, it\u2019s important to understand who and what sits behind the numbers. Most headline metrics in this report focus on Q2 2025 (April 1 \u2013 June 31). Still, any quarter-over-quarter trendlines or \u201cgrowth since last quarter\u201d call-outs extend back to Jan 1, 2025 to give a consistent six-month comparison window. Data streams include platform telemetry (jobs, applications, resumes), parsed job ads, and a 455-respondent survey.\nGeographic Representation\nAmong the Q2 2025 records with location data, the platform exhibits a heavily North American-centric distribution. North America dominates with 69.2% of job postings and 65.5% of resume creations, with the United States alone accounting for 56.6% of located job postings and 53.5% of located resumes. Europe maintains a consistent second position, representing approximately 20% of both jobs and resumes across key markets including the UK, Germany, France, and Italy.\nImplication: Hiring and pay insights are most reliable for the U.S. and Canadian markets and may not generalize globally.\nIndustry and Job-Function Mix\nThe Q2 2025 job market data reveals a heavily tech-dominated landscape, with Internet Software & Services representing 22.4% of all postings, followed by Professional Services (10.9%) and Financial Services (3.5%). The job role distribution reflects this tech concentration: Engineering/Development positions comprise 27.4% of all listings, with Software Engineers, DevOps Engineers, and Front-End Developers among the most sought-after roles. Design positions form another significant category at 13.3%, led by Product Designers (1.9% of all jobs) and UX Designers. Data-related roles represent 12.6% of postings, highlighting the continued importance of analytics capabilities across industries.\nImplication: Trend signals are strongest for tech and industrial hiring; other fields should view the data as directional only.\nExperience-Level Distribution in Resumes\n- Entry-level: 39.2%\n- Senior-level: 32.4%\n- Mid-level: 21.6%\n- Unspecified: 6.8%\nImplication: Behaviors such as resume length or section usage may tilt toward early-career norms.\nSalary-Data Coverage\nOnly 29.3% of jobs include salary information, but those that do reveal competitive compensation with median annual salaries ranging from $100,624 to $143,750.\nCompany-Size Representation\nAmong jobs with known company sizes, enterprise companies (1000+ employees) dominate with 34.4% of postings. Medium-sized companies (51-250 employees) represent the second-largest segment at 20.7%, followed by small businesses (11-50 employees) at 18.6%.\nData Integrity and Disclaimer\nAll insights in this report are based on anonymized user activity and self-reported survey data from Huntr\u2019s platform. Metrics and examples involving employers or platforms reflect aggregate user trends and are not endorsements or critiques of those companies. While care has been taken to ensure data accuracy, all findings should be interpreted as indicative, not definitive.\nJob Search Insights\nTime to First Offer\nHiring Takes Longer: Time to First Offer Up 22% Since April\nThe hiring process is becoming increasingly protracted, with the median time from search initiation to first offer extending from 56 days in April to 68.5 days by June.\nThis represents a concerning 22% increase over just three months, suggesting that organizations are taking substantially longer to move candidates through their recruitment pipelines.\nThe steady month-over-month deterioration, jumping 11 days from April to May, then another 1.5 days into June, indicates a systematic slowdown rather than seasonal fluctuation.\nThis trend could reflect tighter hiring standards, more complex approval processes, or increased candidate evaluation requirements as companies become more selective in their recruitment decisions.\nIndividual Job Timeline\nInterview to Offer Takes Nearly Twice as Long as Application to Interview\nThe job search process reveals a telling pattern in timing expectations. Once an application is submitted, candidates typically wait six days before hearing back for an interview opportunity.\nHowever, the real test of patience comes afterward, the journey from completing interviews to receiving an offer stretches nearly twice as long at eleven days.\nThis extended decision-making period reflects the complexity of hiring processes, where companies often need time to evaluate multiple candidates, conduct internal discussions, and navigate approval workflows.\nFor job seekers, understanding these timelines can help manage expectations and reduce anxiety during what is often the most uncertain phase of career transitions.\nThe nearly two-week wait after interviewing represents a critical period where persistence and patience become essential virtues in the pursuit of new opportunities.\nTime to First Interview\nHalf of Job Seekers Receive their First Interview in 22 days or Less\nThe job interview process reveals a surprising reality for candidates seeking employment opportunities.\nWhile half of all applicants receive their first interview invitation within just over three weeks, the experience becomes increasingly challenging for those who must wait longer.\nCandidates in the 75th percentile face nearly two months of waiting before hearing back from potential employers.\nThe situation becomes particularly difficult for the unlucky few in the 90th percentile, who endure almost four months before receiving their first interview opportunity.\nThis disparity highlights the unpredictable nature of the hiring process, where timing and circumstances can dramatically impact a candidate's journey from application to that crucial first conversation with a prospective employer.\nNumber of Applications Per Week\nApplication Volume Varies Dramatically Across Job Seekers\nWhile half of all job seekers submit 4 or fewer applications per week, the most active quarter of applicants are submitting more than twice that number at 9 applications weekly.\nThe gap becomes even more pronounced at the highest activity levels, where the top 10% of job seekers are pushing out 19 applications per week - nearly five times the median rate.\nThis distribution suggests two distinct job search strategies in the market. The majority of job seekers appear to be taking a more selective, targeted approach with fewer applications, while a smaller segment is pursuing a high-volume strategy.\nThe dramatic increase from the 75th to 90th percentile indicates that the most aggressive job seekers are significantly outpacing their peers, potentially creating competitive pressure in the job market as these high-volume applicants compete for the same positions.\nApplications Created Before Offer Received\nHow Many Applications Job Seekers Need Before Getting an Offer\nFrom Targeted Search to High-Volume Strategy\nOur analysis of job seeker activity from Q2 2025 reveals a fascinating distribution in the number of applications required to secure a job offer.\nThe data indicates that the most common path to success involves submitting between 10 and 20 applications, which accounted for the largest single cohort of users at 20.8%. However, the distribution is not a simple bell curve.\nA significant and contrasting trend emerges at the higher end, with 14.3% of users submitting over 100 applications before receiving an offer.\nThis suggests that while a targeted, efficient search yields results for many, a substantial portion of the job-seeking population must engage in a high-volume, persistent strategy to achieve their goal.\nJob Search Sites\nWith nearly 460k jobs saved in Q2 through our job tracker, we\u2019ve gained unique, ground-level insight into how different job search sites are actually serving job seekers. Since our data is self-reported, you can consider the metrics below as lower bounds; not every user returns to update their progress, like whether they landed an interview.\nMost Popular Job Sites\nLinkedIn Dominates Job Market with Nearly 80% Share, While Indeed Shows Strong Growth\nLinkedIn continues to maintain its overwhelming dominance in the job market, consistently capturing between 77% and 80% of all job saves across the first half of 2025.\nThe professional networking platform's market share remains remarkably stable month-over-month, demonstrating its entrenched position as the go-to destination for job seekers.\nMeanwhile, Indeed emerges as the clear second player, showing impressive growth momentum by expanding its market share from 6.34% in January to 10.48% in June, a 65% increase that suggests it's successfully competing for LinkedIn's users.\nIn contrast, traditional job boards like Dice experienced significant decline, dropping from 4.13% to just 1.53% over the same period. The remaining players, including ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, Welcome to the Jungle, and Wellfound, collectively hold single-digit market shares, while other smaller sites maintain a steady 5-6% of the market.\nThis data reveals a increasingly concentrated job search landscape where LinkedIn's professional network effect continues to drive user preference, though Indeed's rapid growth indicates there's still room for competition in the evolving digital recruitment space.\nJob Search Sites Responsiveness\nGoogle Jobs Delivers Best Response Rates Among Major Platforms\nCertain job sites have higher response rates than others based on user self-reporting. We consider a 'response' as a user moving the job to the interview stage or further in their job search process. That means, if you applied for a job on a particular site, you've heard back from that site at a certain rate.\nWhen it comes to getting responses from job applications, not all popular platforms are created equal. Google Jobs stands out as the clear winner with an impressive 9.3% response rate, nearly three times higher than LinkedIn's 3.3% rate despite LinkedIn processing over 114,000 applications.\nThe most striking finding reveals a disconnect between platform popularity and effectiveness - while LinkedIn dominates application volume, specialized platforms like Glassdoor.com (7.3%) and Wellfound (6.4%) significantly outperform the networking giant in converting applications to interviews.\nAt the bottom end, tech-focused platforms struggle with Dice.com managing only 1.4% of applications receiving responses, suggesting that platform reputation doesn't always translate to hiring manager engagement.\nTop Companies Responsiveness\nTeksystems and Cisco Lead the Pack in Lightning-Fast Interview Scheduling\nTeksystems emerges as the speed champion, connecting with candidates in just 6.5 days on average, closely followed by Cisco at 6.7 days.\nThese tech staffing and networking giants demonstrate that rapid response times are achievable even at scale. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Pinterest takes over five weeks (37.5 days) to schedule interviews, suggesting a more deliberate\u2014or perhaps overwhelmed\u2014approach to candidate evaluation.\nCapital One and Canonical also lag significantly behind, requiring over a month each. The middle ground tells an interesting story too: Amazon, despite handling the highest volume of interviews, maintains a respectable 22-day turnaround.\nMeanwhile, Google keeps pace with industry leaders at just over 9 days, proving that even tech titans can move swiftly when motivated. These timing differences likely reflect varying company cultures, internal processes, and strategic priorities around talent acquisition speed versus thoroughness.\nPopular Applicant Tracking Systems\nGreenhouse Dominates ATS Market\nThe applicant tracking systems landscape shows clear market leaders and notable shifts in the first half of 2025. Greenhouse.io commands the largest market share, growing from 23.27% in January to 29.26% in June, solidifying its position as the dominant platform for job postings.\nMyWorkdayJobs maintains the second-largest share but shows some decline from 17.63% to 15.96% over the period. Meanwhile, AshbyHQ demonstrates consistent growth, rising from 11.15% to 14.56%, positioning itself as a strong third player.\nThe most significant decline comes from Lever, which dropped dramatically from 14.38% in January to just 8.99% by June, suggesting potential challenges in retaining market position.\nThe remaining smaller ATS platforms collectively represent about 20-23% of the market, indicating a fragmented landscape where the top three systems increasingly dominate job posting distribution.\nThis data suggests companies are consolidating around fewer, more established platforms, with Greenhouse.io emerging as the clear winner in the competitive ATS space.\n* Go here for more information on how this data was calculated\nResume Insights\nResume Success Factors\nA successful resume is one that led to an interview, as recorded by users in our job tracker system. Although the true number of interviews is likely underreported, since many users do not consistently update their interview status, the trends observed still offer meaningful insight into what makes a resume effective.\nOur findings indicate that the strength of a successful resume lies not in its length but in the depth of its content in key areas. Candidates who secured interviews typically included more detailed educational histories, had more years of experience, and were more likely to include a LinkedIn profile. In contrast, those who were not interviewed tended to emphasize a greater number of skills and certifications. This contrast suggests that employers prioritize strong professional storytelling over exhaustive lists of competencies, an approach that can significantly influence the likelihood of landing an interview.\nTailoring Resume to Job Descriptions\nTailored Resumes Drive 2.1x Higher Interview Conversion Rates\nOur analysis of self-reported job application data reveals a significant performance gap between tailored and generic resume approaches. Users who customized their resumes for specific positions achieved a 5.75% conversion rate from application to interview or offer stage, compared to just 2.68% for those who did not have a tailored resume, representing a 115% improvement in success rates.\nBased on over 1.39 million applications, since Q4 2024, the data shows tailored resumes generate approximately 6 interview opportunities per 100 applications, compared to fewer than 3 for generic submissions. Since these figures rely on user-reported outcomes for interviews, offers, and hiring decisions, they likely represent conservative floor estimates of the true impact. The findings underscore the critical importance of resume customization in today's competitive job market, where personalized applications demonstrably outperform generic submissions in advancing through hiring processes.\nEducation Section\nDetailed Education Descriptions Give Interview Edge\nResumes that led to interviews have slightly longer education descriptions (100 characters) compared to those who did not (86 characters), suggesting that providing more detailed educational background helps secure interviews.\nCertification Section\nMore Certifications Don't Equal More Interviews\nResumes that did not lead to interviews had more certifications on average (1.41 vs 1.32), indicating that simply accumulating credentials doesn't guarantee interview opportunities.\nSkills Section\nComprehensive Skills Lists Show Modest Interview Advantage\nInterviewed candidates listed slightly more skills (29.9 vs 29.3), though the small difference suggests that having a comprehensive skills section provides only modest advantages.\nAchievements\nQuality Over Quantity Wins in Achievement Writing\nInterviewed candidates wrote fewer but more detailed achievements (4.35 per job at 164 characters each) compared to those not interviewed (4.88 per job at 161 characters each), demonstrating that quality trumps quantity in achievement descriptions.\nWork Experience\nCareer Progression and Experience Drive Interview Success\nInterviewed candidates had both more roles (4.76 vs 4.52) and more total experience (10.5 vs 9.5 years), showing that career progression and tenure both contribute to interview success.\nResume Length by Page Count\nBusting the One-Page Resume Myth: A Data-Driven Answer\nFor decades, job seekers have been told to adhere to the strict \"one-page rule\" for resumes. However, a comprehensive analysis of 76,401 resumes shows that two-page resumes actually have the highest success rate, securing interviews 3.69% of the time. While this is only slightly higher than the 3.36% rate for one-page resumes, the key takeaway is that job seekers should not feel shackled by the one-page myth.\nIf you can effectively showcase your accomplishments on a single page, that's excellent. However, our data suggests it's perfectly acceptable to use a second or even third page (which still sees a strong 3.22% interview rate) if your experience and achievements warrant the space. For more details on our methodology and how we define a resume receiving an interview, please refer to the \"Data for Resume Insights\" section.\nSlightly Longer Resumes Get More Interview Attention\nInterviewed candidates had slightly longer resumes (1.71 vs 1.64 pages), suggesting that providing comprehensive information without being overly verbose is beneficial.\nSummary\nConcise Summaries Outperform Lengthy Ones\nWhile interviewed candidates were more likely to include summaries (94.0% vs 90.2%), they wrote shorter ones (524 vs 568 characters), indicating that concise, focused summaries outperform lengthy ones.\nProjects\nBrief Project Descriptions Work Better Than Detailed Ones\nInterviewed candidates wrote much shorter project descriptions (45 vs 103 characters), demonstrating that brevity and focus are more effective than detailed explanations.\nSocial Links\nPlatform-specific social links and interview success\nCandidates who were interviewed had significantly higher LinkedIn presence (69.4%) compared to those who weren't (61.0%), but surprisingly had lower GitHub presence, suggesting that professional networking trumps code portfolios for getting initial interviews.\nContact Info\nEmail Beats Phone for Professional Contact\nBoth groups had excellent contact information presence, with interviewed candidates having slightly higher email presence (98.9% vs 98.3%) but lower phone presence (91.6% vs 92.5%), suggesting email is more critical than phone for professional communication.\nResume Sections and Length\nResume Section Popularity Overall\nLinkedIn Creates 50% Divide Between Traditional and Modern Resume Approaches\nContact information dominates resume construction, with email addresses appearing in over 93% of base resumes, followed closely by work experience at 89% and education at nearly 89%.\nPhone numbers maintain strong adoption at 86%, while skills sections appear in 84% of resumes. Professional summaries show solid usage at 78%, creating a clear tier of essential resume components.\nA significant drop occurs with LinkedIn profiles at 51%, suggesting a divide between traditional and modern networking approaches. Specialized sections like certifications (40%), projects (27%), and volunteer experience (13%) reveal more selective usage patterns.\nTechnical elements such as GitHub profiles (11%) and custom links (9%) remain niche, while location information appears in fewer than 9% of resumes.\nSocial media presence beyond LinkedIn proves minimal, with Twitter and Dribbble representing less than 1% of resume inclusion.\nResume Section Popularity by Job Category\nEssential Resume Sections Drive Universal Adoption\nEssential resume sections reveal clear patterns across industries, with contact information and core credentials forming the universal foundation.\nEmail addresses appear on nearly every resume (96-99%), while education and work experience maintain similarly high adoption rates above 88%. Industry-specific variations emerge in specialized areas: Information Security professionals lead in certifications at 68%, Creative fields show highest portfolio link usage at 57%, and technical roles demonstrate stronger GitHub presence.\nProfessional networking through LinkedIn maintains moderate adoption between 30-67%, while platform-specific profiles like Twitter and Dribbble remain minimal below 1.4%, suggesting professionals strategically curate their digital presence based on career relevance rather than comprehensive social media representation.\nNumber and Length of Work Experience By Target Seniority\nSenior Professionals Accumulate 14 Years of Experience Across Just 5 Positions\nResume experience patterns reveal distinct career progression stages across seniority levels.\nEntry-level professionals typically accumulate 2 years of experience through 3 different positions, suggesting frequent job changes early in their careers as they explore opportunities and build foundational skills.\nMid-level professionals demonstrate more stability with 6 years of experience across 4 positions, indicating longer tenure per role as they develop specialized expertise.\nSenior professionals show the most dramatic jump to 14 years of experience with 5 positions, reflecting sustained career development and strategic role transitions.\nThe progression shows a clear pattern where years of experience grow exponentially while the number of positions increases more gradually, indicating that career advancement involves both breadth of exposure and depth of experience within each role.\nNumber and Length of Achievements By Target Seniority\nSenior Professionals Write 10% Longer Achievement Descriptions Despite Same Quantity\nResume achievement patterns reveal interesting progression trends across experience levels.\nEntry-level professionals maintain a median of 3 achievements per work experience, with an average character length of 111.8 per achievement. Mid-level professionals show a slight increase to 4 achievements while maintaining similar descriptive detail at 118 characters.\nSenior professionals also average 4 achievements per role, but demonstrate more comprehensive descriptions at 123.5 characters each. The most notable pattern emerges in the consistency of achievement quantity between mid-level and senior roles, suggesting that professionals plateau at around 4 key accomplishments per position, while the increasing character length indicates more detailed and complex responsibility descriptions as seniority advances.\nResume Page Count by Experience\nSenior Professionals Favor Longer Resumes While Entry-Level Workers Keep It Brief\nThe resume length preferences vary dramatically across experience levels, with a clear inverse relationship between career stage and single-page resumes.\nEntry-level professionals overwhelmingly prefer concise formats, with 31.1% using one page and 60.3% sticking to two pages. Mid-level professionals show an even stronger preference for two-page resumes at 65.7%, while only 18.5% opt for single pages.\nSenior professionals demonstrate the most diverse approach to resume length, with just 10.7% using one page and nearly a third (28.1%) extending to three pages.\nThis pattern suggests that as professionals accumulate experience, achievements, and responsibilities, they require more space to effectively communicate their value proposition.\nThe shift toward longer formats among senior professionals likely reflects the need to showcase extensive project portfolios, leadership experience, and technical expertise that can't be adequately captured in brief formats.\nNumber of Skills\nMedian number of skills listed in resumes is 9\nThis analysis examines the number of skills listed on resumes across our platform during Q2 2025. The data represents unique users who had at least one skill listed on their resume, with each user counted only once (using their most complete resume if multiple versions existed).\nThe metrics were calculated by analyzing the length of the skills section for each resume, capturing the 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile values to understand the typical distribution.\nIt reveals a clear distribution pattern, with most professionals clustering around 9 skills on their resumes. At the lower end, 25% of job seekers list 7 or fewer skills, while the top quartile showcases 12 or more competencies.\nWork Tenure and Experience Years\nWork Tenure by Job Title\nYour Frontend Developer Has Packed More Jobs Into Five Years Than Your Office Manager Has in a Decade\nGeneral managers emerge as the most tenured professionals, maintaining an average tenure of 6.8 years in their roles.\nTraditional management and consulting positions dominate the upper echelon of job stability, with managers, consultants, and senior consultants all exceeding six years of tenure.\nThis pattern suggests that leadership roles and advisory positions offer greater career satisfaction and stability compared to more technical or specialized functions.\nThe engineering landscape reveals an interesting hierarchy of tenure, where senior software engineers maintain longer tenures (5.2 years) than their non-senior counterparts (4.3 years), and both significantly outlast the newer development specializations.\nFull stack developers (3.7 years) and frontend developers (3.5 years) show notably shorter tenure periods, possibly reflecting the rapidly evolving nature of these specialized roles and the high demand for their skills in the job market.\nPerhaps most striking is the contrast between traditional business functions and emerging technology roles. While customer service representatives maintain solid 4.5-year tenures, newer disciplines like data science (3.2 years) and data engineering (3.1 years) show considerably shorter job retention.\nThis divergence highlights how established business functions offer more predictable career paths, while cutting-edge technology roles may encourage more frequent movement between organizations as professionals seek to maximize their rapidly appreciating skill sets.\nTotal Experience Years by Target Title\nTechnical Leadership Demands Significant Experience Investment\nThis chart presents the median years of total work experience found in resumes targeting specific job titles, based on data collected from tens of thousands of job seeker resumes in Q2 2025.\nThe analysis examines each resume's combined work history, calculating the total years of experience across all positions and grouping by the job title the resume is targeting. For users with multiple resumes targeting the same role, only their maximum experience value was counted to avoid duplication.\nThe path to executive leadership is longer than most professionals expect. Chief Operating Officers have spent nearly 22 years honing their skills before reaching the pinnacle of operational leadership, while General Managers and Executive Directors aren't far behind with over 20 years of experience each.\nThis isn't just about climbing the corporate ladder; it's about accumulating the deep institutional knowledge, crisis management skills, and strategic thinking that only comes from decades in the trenches.\nTechnical leadership roles demand an equally impressive commitment, with Directors of Engineering requiring nearly 18 years to master both the technical complexity and people management skills their roles demand.\nEven specialized positions like Solution Architects need almost 15 years to develop the systems thinking and client-facing expertise that makes them indispensable. Perhaps most telling is the clear progression pathway that emerges: professionals typically need over a decade to reach senior management roles, nearly two decades for director-level positions, and more than 20 years to qualify for C-suite responsibilities.\nThis timeline reflects the reality that true leadership expertise cannot be rushed\u2014it requires the patient accumulation of experience across multiple business cycles, technological shifts, and organizational challenges.\nEducation in Resume\nTop Fields of Study by Target Role\nComputer Science: The Universal Field of Study of Modern Tech Career Success\nComputer science emerges as the overwhelming educational powerhouse across job categories, claiming the top spot in Software & IT and making strong appearances in Product Management, Information Security, and even Creative & Design roles.\nThis technical education trend reflects how deeply technology has penetrated every corner of the modern workplace, with job seekers recognizing that programming and computational thinking skills have become essential currency.\nMeanwhile, business administration proves to be the versatile generalist degree, securing first place across Administrative & Clerical, Customer Support & Service, Human Resources & Recruiting, Operations & Logistics, and Sales & Business Development categories, demonstrating its enduring value as foundational training for management and operational roles.\nThe educational landscape reveals fascinating specialization patterns that mirror industry evolution.

Traditional Adobe products show interesting salary variations, while Creative Cloud commands $121,025, the older Creative Suite averages $109,173, and individual Adobe applications like Photoshop ($105,076) and InDesign ($93,619) fall toward the lower end of the spectrum. Canva offers a lower average salary at $81,862, likely reflecting its accessibility as a design platform and lower barrier to entry for users.\nSalaries by Company\nTop Paying Companies\nAI and Design Companies Outpace Traditional Tech Giants in Salary Competition\nNetflix dominates the compensation landscape with a median salary midpoint of $410,000, creating a substantial gap between itself and other tech companies. The streaming giant's compensation significantly outpaces even premium tech firms like Figma ($229,000) and NVIDIA ($217,750), which occupy the second and third positions respectively.\nEstablished tech giants present an interesting pattern, while Apple maintains a strong position at $200,300, other major players like Google ($165,000), Amazon ($165,300), and Meta ($157,000) cluster in the middle tier, suggesting that company size and market dominance don't always correlate with peak compensation levels.\nThe emerging fintech sector shows competitive positioning with Stripe at $200,000 and Coinbase at $165,853, while newer platforms like TikTok ($181,000) and DoorDash ($168,000) demonstrate how rapidly scaling companies are investing heavily in talent acquisition.\nNotable is the convergence around the $165,000-$200,000 range, where traditional enterprise companies like Salesforce ($197,050) compete directly with consumer-focused platforms like Airbnb ($198,000) and Pinterest ($183,655), indicating a mature market where talent commands premium rates across diverse business models.\nEducation Requirements\nDegree Requirements by Job Title\nTech Industry Maintains Bachelor's Degree Preference with 95% of Software Jobs Requiring Four-Year Credentials\nThe job market reveals striking disparities in degree requirements across different career paths, with traditional customer service roles bucking the trend toward higher education credentials.\nCustomer Support & Service positions stand out with 60.3% of jobs requiring less than a bachelor's degree, followed by Administrative & Clerical roles at 53.8%, making these the most accessible entry points for workers without four-year degrees.\nIn contrast, technical and specialized fields heavily favor bachelor's degree holders, with Product Management leading at 96.1%, Media & Communications at 96.5%, and Finance & Accounting at 96.8%.\nThe data spanning 62,939 job postings shows that Science & Research positions maintain the highest bar for advanced education, with 36.0% requiring graduate degrees\u2014nearly four times the rate of most other categories.\nSoftware & IT, despite its reputation for valuing skills over credentials, still requires bachelor's degrees for 94.7% of positions, while only 2.5% are accessible to those with high school or associate degrees.\nField of Study Requirements By Industry\nBefore you get started:\nThe data below is sourced from Huntr\u2019s user-submitted job postings. Because our user base leans heavily toward IT and tech roles, technical majors are probably over-represented compared to the overall job market. Consider these percentages as indicative trends, not absolute values.\nThe stacked bar chart highlights how frequently each field of study appears in job requirements, categorized by the hiring company\u2019s industry (not the candidate\u2019s current field).\nTech-focused industries dominate the field of study requirements landscape, with semiconductors and communications equipment leading the charge at 46% and 44% tech-related degree mentions respectively.\nHowever, the story becomes more nuanced when examining the full spectrum of educational backgrounds sought across sectors. While IT services and internet software companies predictably emphasize technical credentials, traditional industries reveal surprising patterns - airlines require one-third tech expertise, and even insurance companies seek nearly 31% tech-qualified candidates, suggesting digital transformation's pervasive impact.\nManufacturing sectors like automobile and electrical equipment balance technical needs with substantial engineering requirements (31% and 36% respectively), while service-oriented industries like professional services and transportation show more diversified educational preferences, blending business acumen with technical skills.\nThe data reveals that pure tech specialization is giving way to hybrid skill sets, with most industries requiring a mix of technical, business, and engineering backgrounds rather than single-discipline expertise.\nFields of Study Growing in Demand\nThis analysis explores shifting requirements for fields of study in tech job postings, comparing Q1 2025 to Q2 2025. The data highlights the relative growth percentage for fields that saw a meaningful percentage point increase (\u22650.25%) in job listings referencing these qualifications. Percentage point (pp) change is calculated by subtracting the Q1 percentage from the Q2 percentage. For instance, let's say Marketing was mentioned in 1.27% of job postings in Q1 2025 and increased to 1.84% in Q2 2025, resulting in a 0.57 percentage point rise. The relative change (44.88%) indicates how significant this increase is compared to the original value (0.57 \u00f7 1.27 = 44.88%).\nBusiness Fields Surge as Technical Disciplines Retreat in Job Market\nBusiness and communication fields captured significant market share gains during the first half of the year, presenting a sharp contrast to the widespread decline in technical fields. Mechanical Engineering emerged as the surprising leader with 37.93% growth in market share, followed by Communications at 25.97% and Finance at 25.00%.\nTraditional business disciplines dominated the growth rankings, with Business, Business Administration, and Accounting all posting gains above 20%. Marketing and Economics showed healthy increases of 17.93% and 14.19% respectively.\nNotably, only two technical fields appeared among the top growth areas\u2014Cybersecurity with a modest 7.69% increase and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with minimal growth of 1.96%.\nThis shift toward business-oriented fields suggests employers are prioritizing commercial and communication skills over pure technical expertise, marking a potential pivot in hiring strategies across industries.\nFields of Study with Declining Demand\nThis visualization highlights fields of study that saw significant drops in demand across tech job listings, comparing Q1 2025 to Q2 2025. The chart presents relative decline percentages for fields with decreases of at least 0.25 percentage points in job requirements. For example, if \"X Field of Study\" appeared in 10% of job listings in Q1 2025 but dropped to 5% in Q2 2025, reflecting a -5 percentage point change. The relative decline of -50% is calculated by dividing this change by the original percentage (-5 \u00f7 10 = -50%), indicating how substantial the decrease is relative to its initial value.\nComputer Engineering Leads Sharp Decline in Technical Field Job Requirements\nTechnical fields experienced notable declines in job market share during the first half of the year, with Computer Engineering suffering the steepest drop at 23.67%.\nDespite maintaining the highest volume with over 111,000 positions, Computer Science saw its market share decrease by 18.81%, while Information Technology declined by 19.82%. Traditional STEM fields like Mathematics and Statistics contracted by 14.08% and 16.11% respectively.\nAmong the high-volume fields analyzed, Design and Software Engineering showed the most resilience with relatively modest market share declines of 7.69% and 8.23%.\nThis broad-based contraction across technical disciplines suggests a significant shift in hiring priorities, with even the most in-demand fields losing ground relative to the overall job market.\nEquivalent Experience Acceptance\nEquivalent Experience Acceptance by Company Size\nEnterprise Companies Nearly Twice as Likely to Accept Experience Over Degrees\nLarger companies demonstrate significantly greater flexibility in their hiring practices when it comes to accepting equivalent experience in lieu of formal degree requirements.\nSmall companies with 1-10 employees show the lowest acceptance rate at just 5.83%, while this figure nearly doubles to 11.44% for organizations with 1000+ employees.\nThe trend is consistent across all company size categories, with mid-sized companies (51-250 employees) accepting equivalent experience 7.6% of the time, and larger firms (251-1000 employees) showing a 9.21% acceptance rate.\nThis progression suggests that enterprise-level organizations have more established processes for evaluating alternative qualifications and may be more willing to prioritize skills and experience over traditional educational credentials.\nThe substantial difference between the smallest and largest companies, a 96% increase in acceptance rates, indicates that company size plays a crucial role in determining hiring flexibility.\nTop Job Categories Accepting Equivalent Experience\nCybersecurity Employers Prioritize Hands-On Skills While Tech Industry Maintains Degree Requirements\nInformation Security leads the way as the most accommodating field for equivalent experience, with nearly one in five job postings (19.21%) accepting practical skills over formal degrees.\nThis suggests cybersecurity employers prioritize hands-on expertise and certifications over traditional academic credentials. Media & Communications follows at 11.11%, reflecting an industry where portfolio work and demonstrated creativity often outweigh educational background.\nCustomer Support & Service rounds out the top three at 10.97%, indicating service-oriented roles value communication skills and problem-solving abilities that can be developed through experience.\nInterestingly, while Software & IT represents the largest job category with over 43,000 positions, only 10.3% accept equivalent experience, suggesting this field maintains stronger degree requirements despite its technical nature.\nThe data reveals a clear divide between fields that embrace skills-based hiring and those that still favor formal education, with most categories hovering between 7-10% acceptance rates for equivalent experience.\nArtificial intelligence\nAI Skills\nAI Tools Surge to 1,499 Job Postings as Employers Prioritize Hands-On Implementation Skills\nThe AI job market reveals a clear hierarchy of in-demand skills, with general \"AI\" knowledge being the most sought-after competency, appearing in 3,349 unique job postings.\nThis is followed by more specific capabilities like \"AI tools\" (1,499 jobs) and \"Generative AI\" (1,340 jobs), indicating that employers are looking for both broad AI understanding and hands-on experience with practical AI applications.\nThe prominence of \"Artificial Intelligence\" as a foundational skill (1,078 jobs) alongside more specialized areas like \"AI technologies\" (556 jobs) and \"AI integration\" (501 jobs) suggests that the market values both theoretical knowledge and implementation expertise. Notably, emerging areas such as \"Conversational AI\" (108 jobs), \"AI ethics\" (69 jobs), and \"AI agents\" (79 jobs) are gaining traction, reflecting the industry's evolution toward more sophisticated and responsible AI applications.\nThe landscape underscores that while general AI literacy remains paramount, employers are increasingly seeking candidates who can navigate the practical challenges of deploying AI solutions, integrating AI into existing systems, and developing AI-powered products and services.\nIndustry\nIndustry Concentration in Our Top Cities\nHow we came up with our rankings\nWe introduce a novel approach to visualizing industry concentration across North American cities. Rather than relying solely on absolute job numbers, which can be skewed toward larger metropolitan areas, we've calculated the percentage of each city's total job listings that belong to specific industries.\nThe heatmap visualization ranks cities by their industry concentration, showing the top five locations where each industry represents the highest proportion of local job opportunities. This approach addresses several limitations in traditional job market data. First, it compensates for sampling biases in our user base, which may over-represent certain regions. Second, it normalizes for population differences, allowing smaller cities with strong industry presence to appear alongside major metropolitan areas.\nIt's important to note that high concentration doesn't necessarily indicate the highest number of available positions; rather, it signals where specific industries play a particularly significant role in the local economy.\nSilicon Valley's Grip Tightens: San Francisco, Seattle, and San Jose Command Top Three in Internet Software Jobs\nThe job market data reveals distinct geographic clustering patterns across North America's major tech and business hubs.\nSan Francisco claims the top spot in Internet Software, followed by Seattle in second and San Jose in third, highlighting Silicon Valley's continued supremacy in tech innovation. Interestingly, Winnipeg ranks first in Professional Services, outpacing traditional business centers like Washington DC (second) and Charlotte (third).\nFinancial services show a more distributed pattern, with Toronto leading the rankings but Charlotte, New York, and Dallas all securing positions in the top four. The data also reveals specialized industry clusters: Charlotte's first-place ranking in banking, Boston's leadership positions in both healthcare providers and pharmaceuticals, and San Jose's top rankings in both semiconductors and communications equipment.\nThese patterns suggest that while certain cities have established themselves as clear industry leaders, the job market shows both expected concentrations (tech cities dominating software rankings, finance in traditional hubs) and some surprising regional strengths, particularly in Canadian markets and emerging US business centers.\nThe concentration is so strong in some sectors that the same cities appear repeatedly in top rankings - San Jose holds first place in three different tech-related industries, while Boston leads in two healthcare sectors.\nLocation Requirements\nLocation Requirements by Company Size\nWork Location Transparency Declines as Company Size Grows\nThe relationship between company size and work arrangement transparency reveals a striking pattern across job postings.\nSmall companies with 1-10 employees demonstrate the highest commitment to remote work at 31.82%, yet this percentage steadily decreases as organizations grow larger, dropping to just 15.50% for companies with over 1,000 employees.\nWhat's most remarkable is the inverse trend in unspecified work arrangements, while smaller companies leave 39.51% of their postings ambiguous about location requirements, this figure climbs dramatically to 52.53% for the largest enterprises.\nThis suggests that major corporations are increasingly reluctant to commit to specific work arrangements in their job advertisements, perhaps maintaining flexibility for case-by-case negotiations.\nMeanwhile, hybrid and onsite arrangements remain relatively stable across all company sizes, hovering between 12-16% each, indicating these models have found consistent adoption regardless of organizational scale.\nThe findings challenge assumptions about large companies being more structured in their communications, instead revealing that smaller organizations provide clearer expectations about where work will actually happen.\nLocation Requirements by Job Category\nRemote Work Dominates While Hybrid Struggles to Find Footing\nThe modern job market shows a clear preference for remote work opportunities, with most professional categories offering 13-32% of positions as fully remote, led by Customer Support & Service at 32.04% and Writing & Editing at 30.67%.\nHowever, hybrid arrangements consistently lag behind across all fields, rarely exceeding 19% in any category except Legal (19.09%), suggesting organizations favor decisive remote or onsite policies over flexible splitting arrangements.\nInterestingly, Science & Research bucks the remote trend entirely, showing the lowest remote adoption at just 9.86% while maintaining the highest onsite requirements at 19.97%, demonstrating that research-intensive roles requiring specialized equipment and collaborative lab work continue to favor in-person environments.\nMonthly Trends in Location Requirements\nJob Posting Ambiguity Reaches New High: 54% of Listings Fail to Mention Work Location by June 2025\nJob posting transparency has reached a troubling low point, with over half of all listings now failing to specify location requirements, a trend that has accelerated dramatically throughout early 2025. This growing ambiguity represents a fundamental shift in how employers communicate workplace expectations, leaving job seekers to guess whether positions are remote, hybrid, or onsite.\nWhile remote opportunities continue their gradual decline and hybrid arrangements hold steady, the real story is the erosion of clear communication in hiring practices.\nThis lack of transparency not only creates unnecessary friction in the job search process but also suggests many employers themselves may be uncertain about their long-term workplace policies, defaulting to vague language rather than making definitive commitments about work arrangements.\nSkills Requirements\nSkill Requirement Count By Job Category\nSkill Benchmarks: Decoding the Typical Range of Requirements in Job Postings\nWhile averages can be skewed by a few unusually demanding job posts, the real story of what employers expect is found in the middle ground. To understand this, we analyzed the \"middle 50%\" of job postings for each category. The chart below shows the median (the exact midpoint) alongside the 25th and 75th percentiles, revealing the most common range of required skills. For instance, a typical Software & IT role (median) lists 13 skills, but it's common to see postings asking for anywhere from 10 to 17. This data provides a clear benchmark for what's truly standard in your field, helping you move beyond averages and tailor your resume to the most likely expectations.\nTop Skills by Company Size\nHow Startup and Enterprise Skill Demands Paint Two Different Pictures of Software Development\nThere's a deep difference between the technical skills prioritized by startups versus enterprise organizations. Startup-focused skills cluster around modern web development technologies and cloud-native infrastructure.\nReact leads the startup preference with 6.02% representation compared to just 1.03% in enterprise roles, followed closely by TypeScript, Node.js, and JavaScript.\nThese companies gravitate toward lightweight, flexible technologies that enable rapid development cycles and quick iteration.\nThe startup ecosystem also shows a strong preference for containerization (Docker), cloud platforms (AWS), and modern databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis), reflecting their need for scalable, cost-effective solutions that can grow with their business.\nEnterprise organizations, conversely, demonstrate a clear preference for established, enterprise-grade technologies that prioritize stability, security, and long-term maintainability.\nJava and SQL dominate the enterprise landscape, with SQL appearing in 4.71% of enterprise postings versus 3.60% in startups. The enterprise preference extends to mature frameworks like Spring Boot, cloud platforms like Azure, and the entire Microsoft stack including C# and .NET.\nThis pattern reflects enterprise priorities around compliance, integration with existing systems, and technologies with robust vendor support and extensive documentation.\nWhile the technical skills divide is pronounced, it's worth noting that soft skills requirements likely show less variation between company types. Both startups and enterprises value communication, problem-solving, and collaboration abilities, though the context may differ.\nStartups might emphasize adaptability and wearing multiple hats, while enterprises may focus more on stakeholder management and working within established processes.\nThe ability to translate technical concepts to non-technical team members, mentor junior developers, and contribute to architectural decisions remains valuable across all company sizes, even as the specific technologies vary dramatically.\nTop Skills by Job Category\nCommunication Required in 50-72% of Jobs Across All Industries in 2025\nAn analysis reveals distinct skill requirements across seven major industries, with each field demanding a unique blend of technical expertise and soft skills. While technical competencies vary dramatically by sector\u2014from Python in Software & IT to Figma in Creative & Design\u2014communication skills emerge as a universal constant across all industries.\nSoftware & IT - Python (33.86%), JavaScript (29.83%), and React (25.17%) are the top three most in-demand skills in Software & IT, with Python appearing in over one-third of all job listings.\nData & Analytics - SQL (68.8%), Python (60.84%), and Communication (54.51%) round out the top three, with SQL being required in more than two-thirds of all job listings in this field.\nCreative & Design - Figma dominates the Creative & Design field at 61.03%, followed by Communication (53.02%) and Collaboration (47.94%) as the top three most in-demand skills.\nProduct Management - Product Management leads at 63.11%, followed closely by Communication (62.51%) and Data Analysis (30.88%) as the top three most in-demand skills in this field.\nSales & Business Development - Communication (72.12%), Sales (34.61%), and Negotiation (16.79%) lead the pack, with communication being required in nearly three-quarters of all job listings.\nInformation Security - Communication leads as the core competency at 50.56%, followed by Incident Response (29.22%) and Cybersecurity (26.81%) as the top three most in-demand skills in Information Security.\nMarketing & Advertising - Communication tops the list at 51.02%, showing that effective messaging is what's really required in marketing, followed by Project Management (32.05%) and Digital Marketing (24.14%).\nThe data underscores a fundamental shift in the modern workplace where technical proficiency alone is insufficient\u2014communication skills have become the universal currency of professional success. Across industries ranging from highly technical fields like Information Security to creative disciplines, the ability to effectively communicate ranks among the top three requirements, signaling that tomorrow's workforce must master both domain expertise and interpersonal skills.\nTop Growing Skills Overall\nAI Skills Explode in Job Market as Companies Rush to Automate, Leaving Soft Skills Behind\nWe compared unique job postings saved in Q1 2025 and Q2 2025, extracting skill requirements from each and calculating two normalized growth measures for every skill: job-market-adjusted growth, which reflects the percentage change in a skill\u2019s share of all postings, and company-adjusted growth, which captures the change in its share of distinct hiring companies over the same period.\nThe most striking finding is the explosive demand for AI tools, which experienced a 96.8% growth rate and expanded its market presence from 0.275% to 0.700% of all job postings. This dramatic surge far outpaces all other skills, with the next highest growth rates being systems thinking at 30.8%, contract negotiation at 26.1%, and site reliability engineering at 26.0%. What's particularly noteworthy is that while AI tools dominate the landscape, infrastructure and operational skills are experiencing robust growth, with observability growing 20.8%, operational excellence at 20.8%, and infrastructure-as-code expanding 14.0%. The data reveals a clear pattern where organizations are not just chasing AI trends but are thoughtfully building the operational maturity required to support these advanced technologies, suggesting that companies recognize the need for both cutting-edge AI capabilities and the foundational technical expertise to deploy and manage them reliably in production environments.\nSkills Gap\nTo map today's skills gap, we combined two sides of the Huntr platform:\n- Demand (jobs). We analyzed every public job posting created since April 1, 2025, mapping various job-title keywords into 9 broader role categories, then deduplicated by company + title. For each role, we counted how many of those distinct postings mention every hard skill (soft-skill keywords were excluded). Our analysis covered 171 distinct skills across roles, including Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, DevOps Engineer, Data Analyst, Mobile Developer, QA Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and Full Stack Developer.\n- Supply (resumes). On the same timeline, we examined \"base\" resumes that job-seekers built in Huntr, matched each resume's target job title to the same 9 role categories, and cataloged the hard skills users explicitly added to their profiles.\nFrom those two pools, we calculate three key metrics for every skill within each role:\n- Demand % measures how frequently employers request a given skill within a role category. We calculate it by dividing the number of job postings that mention the skill by the total number of postings for that role. For example, JavaScript appears in 100% of Frontend Developer job postings, while API skills are mentioned in 35.7% of Backend Developer positions.\n- Supply % captures how common that skill is among job-seekers. We compute it by dividing the number of resumes that list the skill by the total number of resumes targeting the same role. A higher value means a larger share of candidates claim the capability - for instance, 15.6% of Frontend Developer candidates list JavaScript skills.\n- Gap ratio puts the two together by dividing Demand % by Supply %. A ratio near 1 indicates balance; anything above 1 signals a shortage (employers want the skill more often than candidates offer it), while values below 1 suggest an oversupply. Our data reveals significant gaps, with API skills showing the highest ratio at 8.7x, meaning companies request this skill nearly 9 times more often than candidates list it.\nThe most in-demand skills with the largest gaps include API development (8.7x gap), React (8.5x gap), Java (8.2x gap), and AWS (8.0x gap), indicating critical talent shortages in these areas.\nSoftware Development Skills Gap Analysis\nData reveals specialized infrastructure skills face 60\u00d7 shortfalls in 2025, while core programming languages approach equilibrium\n- Cloud platforms emerge as the most critical gap at 59.86\u00d7, with only 0.07% of developer resumes mentioning this skill despite 3.98% of job posts requiring it.\n- Software development fundamentals show a 13.7\u00d7 gap (10.93% demand vs 0.8% supply), indicating employers seek deeper expertise than basic coding knowledge.\n- Infrastructure-oriented skills like relational databases (9.4\u00d7 gap) and software engineering (8.27\u00d7 gap) reveal significant shortages in backend specialization.\n- Core programming languages show better balance: JavaScript (1.32\u00d7 gap), SQL (1.3\u00d7 gap), and Python (1.2\u00d7 gap) demonstrate that fundamental coding skills have adequate supply.\n- DevOps-adjacent skills like microservices (3.01\u00d7 gap) and system design (3.14\u00d7 gap) sit in the middle tier, reflecting moderate infrastructure skill shortages. In essence, while basic programming competencies are well-supplied, specialized cloud and infrastructure expertise represents the field's most pressing talent shortage.\nData and Analytics Skills Gap Analysis\nAnalytics field shows 23\u00d7 cloud platform deficit while traditional skills maintain better balance\n- Cloud platforms again top the gap analysis at 23.32\u00d7 (4.8% demand vs 0.21% supply), highlighting infrastructure as the biggest bottleneck in data roles.\n- Data engineering shows a severe 12.01\u00d7 shortfall (13.35% demand vs 1.11% supply), revealing the scarcity of professionals who can build data infrastructure.\n- Core analytical skills demonstrate mixed results: data analysis leads demand at 37.96% but maintains reasonable supply (11.03%), creating a manageable 3.44\u00d7 gap.\n- Traditional data skills show better equilibrium: Spark (1.32\u00d7 gap), statistical modeling (1.42\u00d7 gap), and project management (1.42\u00d7 gap) indicate adequate talent pools.\n- Modern data stack tools like ETL (2.14\u00d7 gap) and data modeling (2.07\u00d7 gap) fall into moderate shortage territory. The data reveals a clear bifurcation: while fundamental analytical and visualization skills are reasonably supplied, engineering-heavy data infrastructure roles face acute talent shortages.\nDesign Skills Gap Analysis\nPortfolio presentation crisis hits 37\u00d7 gap while core UX/UI skills face significant shortages\n- Portfolio skills show the most extreme gap at 36.63\u00d7 (3.66% demand vs 0% supply), suggesting candidates fail to properly showcase their work rather than lacking design ability.\n- Core UX competencies face substantial shortages: UX design (3.49\u00d7 gap), user experience (3.83\u00d7 gap), and user-centered design (2.89\u00d7 gap) all indicate high employer demand exceeding talent supply.\n- Product design dominates demand at 34.6% but shows manageable supply (11.39%), creating a 3.04\u00d7 gap that reflects the field's evolution toward product-focused roles.\n- SaaS experience emerges as a critical specialization gap at 4.45\u00d7 (5.64% demand vs 1.27% supply), highlighting the industry's cloud-first direction.\n- Traditional design methodology skills show better balance: Agile (1.41\u00d7 gap) and user experience design (1.39\u00d7 gap) demonstrate adequate practitioner availability. The analysis reveals that while design fundamentals are moderately supplied, portfolio presentation skills and specialized product/SaaS experience represent the field's most critical gaps.\nProduct Management Skills Gap Analysis\nCore product management expertise faces 6\u00d7 shortfall while traditional project skills remain balanced\n- Product management itself shows a critical 6.21\u00d7 gap (74.84% demand vs 12.06% supply), indicating a fundamental shortage of qualified product managers across the industry.\n- B2B SaaS specialization presents the highest gap at 8.47\u00d7 (4.09% demand vs 0.48% supply), reflecting the specialized knowledge required for modern software products\n- Technical product management skills show significant shortages: AI (5\u00d7 gap), software development (4.19\u00d7 gap), and user experience (3.93\u00d7 gap) reveal demand for technically-savvy PMs.\n- Data-driven product management emerges strongly with 35.24% demand for data analysis skills, though supply (13.02%) creates a moderate 2.71\u00d7 gap.\n- Traditional project management skills demonstrate better balance at 1.51\u00d7 gap (21.09% demand vs 13.99% supply), showing transferable skills from other disciplines. The data exposes a critical shortage of modern product management expertise, particularly in technical and B2B domains, while traditional project coordination skills remain adequately supplied.\nAdministrative and Virtual Assistance Skills Gap Analysis\nSpecialized office skills show 4\u00d7 gaps while basic software proficiency approaches balance\n- MS Office specialization ties for the highest gap at 4.07\u00d7 (6.14% demand vs 1.51% supply), alongside administrative experience (4.07\u00d7 gap), indicating employers seek advanced proficiency beyond basic familiarity.\n- Travel coordination emerges as a specialized skill gap at 3.36\u00d7 (3.8% demand vs 1.13% supply), reflecting the complexity of modern business travel management.\n- Microsoft Outlook shows a 3.2\u00d7 gap (4.83% demand vs 1.51% supply), highlighting the importance of professional communication and calendar management skills.\n- Core Microsoft Office applications demonstrate better balance: Word (1.49\u00d7 gap) and PowerPoint (1.61\u00d7 gap) show adequate basic competency in the talent pool.\n- Event planning achieves the best balance at 1.34\u00d7 gap (5.05% demand vs 3.77% supply), indicating this skill transfers well from various backgrounds. The analysis reveals that while basic office software literacy is adequate, employers struggle to find candidates with advanced administrative specialization and proven experience.\nCustomer Success & Support Skills Gap Analysis\nCustomer success expertise faces 12\u00d7 shortage while traditional support skills remain balanced\n- Customer success skills show a critical 12.01\u00d7 gap (37.64% demand vs 3.13% supply), highlighting this emerging field's severe talent shortage as companies prioritize retention over acquisition.\n- Call center experience presents an extreme 37.68\u00d7 gap (3.77% demand vs 0% supply), suggesting a complete disconnect between traditional support backgrounds and modern customer success roles.\n- SaaS expertise shows significant gaps: general SaaS (8.58\u00d7 gap) and B2B SaaS (16.45\u00d7 gap) reflect the industry's cloud transformation outpacing talent development.\n- Account management demonstrates a significant but manageable 3.19\u00d7 gap (23.32% demand vs 7.31% supply), indicating this traditional skill partially transfers to customer success.\n- Traditional support competencies show good balance: CRM (1.57\u00d7 gap), sales (1.67\u00d7 gap), and customer engagement (1.56\u00d7 gap) demonstrate adequate foundational skills. The data reveals customer success as an emerging discipline with critical talent shortages, while traditional support and sales skills provide a foundation that companies can build upon.\nMarketing Skills Gap Analysis\nB2B SaaS marketing shows 59\u00d7 deficit while digital fundamentals achieve near-equilibrium\n- B2B SaaS marketing faces the most extreme gap at 58.57\u00d7 (5.86% demand vs 0% supply), with general B2B marketing also showing zero supply (47.99\u00d7 gap), indicating a complete absence of specialized B2B marketing talent.\n- Product marketing emerges as a critical specialization at 7.29\u00d7 gap (27.19% demand vs 3.73% supply), reflecting the shift toward product-led growth strategies.\n- Sales enablement shows a significant 6.26\u00d7 gap (9.34% demand vs 1.49% supply), highlighting the missing bridge between marketing and sales functions.\n- Data-driven marketing faces a 3.09\u00d7 gap (25.38% demand vs 8.21% supply), showing the field's evolution toward analytical decision-making.\n- Digital marketing fundamentals demonstrate strong balance: social media (1.35\u00d7 gap), content creation (1.45\u00d7 gap), and growth marketing (1.4\u00d7 gap) indicate adequate practitioner availability. The analysis exposes a bifurcated market where traditional digital marketing skills are well-supplied, but specialized B2B and product marketing expertise represents a critical industry bottleneck.\nJob Search Survey Insights\nSurvey\nJob Search Trends Survey\nAI and the Job Search\nAI Hiring\n68% of Candidates Would Take Jobs Where Humans Never Interview Them\nThe robots are taking over the hiring process, and most job seekers are surprisingly okay with it. In a striking revelation, 67.7% of respondents (308 out of 455) said they would accept a job offer from a company whose entire hiring process was conducted by AI, while only 32.3% (147 individuals) would refuse such an offer.\nThis roughly 2:1 ratio suggests that while AI-mediated hiring has gained substantial acceptance among job seekers, a notable minority, approximately one in three candidates, remains hesitant or opposed to fully automated recruitment processes.\nThe data reflect a workforce that is increasingly comfortable with technological innovation in hiring practices, although the persistence of a substantial skeptical cohort indicates that companies implementing AI-only hiring systems may still face resistance from a significant portion of the talent pool.\nThis divide could have important implications for organizations considering the adoption of fully automated recruitment systems, as they may risk excluding nearly a third of potential candidates who prefer human involvement in the hiring process.\nGen Z Outpaces Millennials in Embracing AI Hiring, 78% vs. 68% Acceptance Rate\nGen Z is leading the charge into the AI-powered future of hiring, with nearly 8 out of 10 young professionals ready to let algorithms decide their career fate.\nThis digital-native generation shows remarkable comfort with fully automated recruitment, 77.8% would accept a job offer without ever speaking to a human recruiter.\nMillennials follow closely behind at 68.4%, suggesting that those who grew up alongside technology's rise are largely embracing its role in shaping their careers.\nThe real surprise comes from Gen X, traditionally seen as the bridge between analog and digital worlds, who show the most skepticism with only 60.3% willing to trust AI with their job prospects.\nPerhaps most intriguing is the Baby Boomer response: despite stereotypes about older workers resisting technology, they're actually more open to AI hiring (66.7%) than Gen X, though their smaller sample size of just 18 respondents makes this finding more of a curious footnote than a definitive trend.\nWhat emerges is a workforce increasingly willing to trade human intuition for algorithmic efficiency, with only Gen X holding the line as cautious gatekeepers questioning whether machines should really be making such fundamentally human decisions.\nMale Job Seekers 6 Points More Likely Than Women to Accept Machine-Led Hiring\nA subtle but notable gender divide emerges in attitudes toward AI-driven hiring, with male job seekers showing distinctly more enthusiasm for algorithmic recruitment than their female counterparts.\nAt 70.8% acceptance, men lead the charge in embracing fully automated hiring processes, with 172 out of 243 male respondents willing to let machines make the final call on their career prospects.\nWomen demonstrate more caution, though still a solid majority\u201465% of the 197 female respondents would accept an AI-only job offer, suggesting that while they're generally open to the technology, they harbor slightly more reservations about removing human judgment from the hiring equation.\nThe 5.8 percentage point gap might reflect different experiences with bias in traditional hiring, varying comfort levels with technology, or distinct perspectives on the value of human interaction in assessing workplace fit.\nAmong non-binary respondents and those preferring not to disclose their gender, acceptance rates drop to 57.1% and 50% respectively, though these smaller sample sizes make it difficult to draw firm conclusions.\nWhat's clear is that while AI hiring has achieved mainstream acceptance across gender lines, the technology's appeal isn't entirely gender-neutral, with men appearing more ready to trust algorithms with their professional futures.\nThe Desperation Factor: 77% of Unemployed Accept AI Hiring vs. 55% of Passive Job Seekers\nDesperation breeds acceptance when it comes to AI-driven hiring, with unemployed job seekers showing the highest willingness to let algorithms decide their fate.\nA striking 77% of actively unemployed respondents would accept a job offer from an AI-only hiring process, suggesting that the urgency of finding work outweighs concerns about automated recruitment.\nThis pattern continues down the employment spectrum: those employed but actively hunting for new opportunities show 68.5% acceptance, while self-employed professionals seeking contracts land at 64.3%.\nThe real skepticism emerges among passive job seekers, those comfortably employed and merely open to opportunities, where acceptance drops to just 55.3%, indicating that job security affords the luxury of being choosier about hiring methods.\nPerhaps most intriguing are the recently laid-off workers, who despite their presumed urgency, show the lowest acceptance at 52.2%, split almost evenly between yes and no.\nThis unexpected resistance might reflect fresh wounds from being let go by human decision-makers, making them more cautious about trusting machines with their next career move.\nThe overall pattern suggests that AI hiring acceptance isn't just about technological comfort; it's deeply intertwined with economic necessity and the leverage job seekers feel they have in the market.\nThe Executive Rebellion: Only Career Level Where Majority Rejects AI Hiring\nThe corporate ladder reveals a striking pattern in AI hiring acceptance: the higher you climb, the less you trust machines to make recruitment decisions.\nAmong the 452 respondents who disclosed their career level (three participants skipped this question), entry-level job seekers lead the charge with 77.1% acceptance, eagerly embracing automated hiring as they seek to break into the workforce.\nThis enthusiasm gradually wanes as professionals advance in their careers\u2014mid-career workers drop to 66.2% acceptance, while senior-level professionals hover at 68.7%.\nBut the real story emerges at the executive level, where acceptance plummets to just 49%, making C-suite candidates the only group where more people reject AI hiring than accept it.\nThis dramatic 28-point gap between entry-level and executive acceptance suggests a fundamental disconnect: those just starting their careers see AI as a fair, efficient gateway to opportunity, while those who've reached the top believe that leadership qualities, strategic thinking, and executive presence simply can't be assessed by algorithms.\nThe pattern hints at a deeper truth about hiring, that as roles become more complex and nuanced, the human elements of judgment, intuition, and interpersonal assessment become increasingly irreplaceable.\nExecutives, who often make hiring decisions themselves, appear uniquely positioned to understand what machines might miss when evaluating top-tier talent.\nAI or Automation Job Loss\n90% of Job Seekers Haven't Lost Work to AI Despite Rising Fears\nDespite the doom and gloom headlines about AI taking over the workforce, a surprising 90.3% of job seekers report they've never actually lost a job to automation or artificial intelligence.\nAmong the 455 survey respondents, only 44 individuals (9.7%) have experienced the reality of being replaced by technology.\nThis contrast between public anxiety and actual experiences reveals an interesting disconnect - while the fear of AI-driven unemployment dominates career conversations and media narratives, the vast majority of workers haven't personally faced this disruption.\nThe data suggests that although AI-related job displacement is indeed happening and affecting nearly 1 in 10 respondents, the robot revolution hasn't quite arrived at the scale many predicted.\nOf course, these numbers capture past experiences rather than future possibilities, leaving open the question of whether this relatively low percentage represents the calm before the storm or evidence that humans and AI will find ways to coexist in the workplace.\nAI Doesn't Discriminate: Job Loss Hits Men (9.5%) and Women (9.1%) Equally\nGender appears to play a minimal role in who gets displaced by AI and automation, with male and female workers experiencing nearly identical rates of job loss, 9.5% and 9.1% respectively.\nThis remarkable similarity challenges assumptions about whether certain genders might be more vulnerable to technological unemployment. The data hints at a slightly different story for non-binary respondents, where 14.3% report losing work to AI, though with only 7 people in this category, it's hard to draw firm conclusions.\nPerhaps most intriguing is the \"prefer not to say\" group, where 25% report AI-related job loss, double the rate of other groups. While this could be statistical noise given the tiny sample of 8 people, it raises questions about whether those who've experienced AI displacement might be more reluctant to share demographic information, possibly due to stigma or privacy concerns around job loss.\nOverall, the data suggests that when it comes to being replaced by algorithms and automation, the playing field is surprisingly level across gender lines, at least for now.\nGen Z Reports Higher AI Displacement Than Millennials\nBaby Boomers and Gen Z find themselves in an unexpected alliance, both generations are more likely to lose their jobs to AI than the workers sandwiched between them.\nWhile 16.7% of Baby Boomers report being displaced by automation, this shocking figure comes with a caveat: only 18 Boomers participated, making this percentage more of a statistical whisper than a shout. Gen Z tells a clearer story at 11.1%, entering a workforce where AI isn't just a futuristic concept but an active competitor for entry-level positions.\nMeanwhile, Millennials (9.3%) and Gen X (8.4%) appear to occupy a sweet spot, experienced enough to avoid the automation of junior roles, yet not so senior as to be targets for cost-cutting technological replacements.\nThis generational pattern suggests that AI disruption isn't hitting workers uniformly across age groups; instead, it's creating a U-shaped curve where the youngest workers learning the ropes and the oldest workers nearing retirement face the highest risk of being automated away.\nAI Tools in Job Search\n93% of Job Seekers Now Use AI Tools for Their Job Search\nNearly half of today's job seekers are turning to AI tools like ChatGPT and AI resume builders like Huntr as their secret weapon in the competitive job market, finding them incredibly valuable for landing their next role.\nThe landscape of job hunting has dramatically shifted, with an overwhelming 93% of candidates now leveraging artificial intelligence in some capacity during their search.\nWhat's particularly striking is the satisfaction rate, among those who've experimented with AI assistance, the vast majority report positive results, with only a small fraction dismissing these tools as unhelpful.\nThis widespread adoption signals a fundamental transformation in how people approach career transitions, where AI has evolved from a novel experiment to an essential component of the modern job search toolkit.\nThe tiny percentage still holding out without AI assistance increasingly represents the exception rather than the rule, suggesting that mastery of these digital tools may soon become as crucial as the resume itself.\nUsing AI At Work\nOnly 2.6% of Job Seekers Fear AI Will Take Their Jobs\nJob seekers are embracing AI with remarkable enthusiasm, with more than half viewing it as a career-enhancing productivity booster that's transforming how they work.\nWhile excitement leads the sentiment, a substantial group maintains healthy skepticism; they're using AI but keeping their eyes open to potential pitfalls.\nThis cautious optimism reflects a mature approach to technological adoption, where professionals recognize both the opportunities and challenges AI presents.\nInterestingly, fears about job replacement barely register in the data, suggesting that job seekers see AI more as a powerful colleague than a competitor.\nThe tiny fraction who don't trust AI or worry about job security are vastly outnumbered by those who've integrated these tools into their daily workflows.\nEven more telling is that less than 2% report AI hasn't touched their industry yet, a clear signal that AI adoption has reached nearly every corner of the professional world.\nThis widespread acceptance marks a pivotal moment in workplace evolution, where AI has shifted from a futuristic concept to an everyday reality that most job seekers not only accept but actively champion.\nAI Interviews\n7 in 10 Job Seekers Reject AI Interviews, Demand Human Connection\nThe overwhelming rejection of one-way AI interviews reveals a fundamental truth about human nature: we crave connection, especially during vulnerable moments like job interviews.\nNearly 70% of job seekers would rather face the nervousness of speaking to a real person than record themselves talking to a blank screen, highlighting how these AI-driven formats strip away the very essence of what makes interviews valuable: the ability to read the room, build rapport, and engage in genuine dialogue.\nThe small minority who embrace these digital monologues perhaps see them as a chance to perfect their responses without the pressure of real-time interaction, while the quarter who remain indifferent have likely accepted this as just another hoop to jump through in an increasingly automated world.\nThis preference for human interaction suggests that companies rushing to automate their hiring processes may be solving for the wrong problem, saving time and money at the expense of attracting top talent who view these impersonal screenings as a red flag about company culture.\nThe message from job seekers is clear: in an era of increasing automation, the human touch in hiring isn't just preferred; it's overwhelmingly demanded.\nRemote Work\nWork Location Preferences\nThe Office Is Dead: Only 3% of Job Seekers Want Full-Time Cubicle Life\nThe future of work is undeniably flexible. An overwhelming 44% of job seekers are drawn to hybrid arrangements, craving the perfect blend of home comfort and office collaboration.\nClose behind, nearly 39% are all-in on remote work, ready to trade commutes for cozy home offices. Together, these flexibility-seekers make up a staggering 83% of the job market.\nMeanwhile, the traditional 9-to-5 office life? It's becoming an endangered species, with a mere 3% of candidates willing to commit to full-time cubicle dwelling. Even those with \"no strong preference\" outnumber the office devotees by more than four to one.\nThe message is crystal clear: companies clinging to pre-pandemic work models risk watching top talent slip through their fingers, while those embracing flexibility have their pick of the candidate pool.\nYour Office Mandate Just Eliminated 90% of Your Candidate Pool\nRemote work isn't just a perk anymore\u2014it's a dealbreaker. Nearly half of today's job seekers won't even consider a position without flexible work options, and another 40% see it as a significant factor in their decision.\nThis dramatic shift means that companies stubbornly clinging to traditional office-only policies are essentially removing themselves from consideration by 9 out of 10 potential candidates.\nThe message couldn't be clearer: flexibility has become the new competitive currency in talent acquisition.\nWhile a small fraction of workers (just over 10%) remain indifferent to where they work, they're increasingly becoming the exception rather than the rule.\nFor organizations serious about winning the war for talent, the question is no longer whether to offer remote work, but how to make their flexible arrangements stand out in a market where flexibility has become table stakes.\nSide Hustles\nIncome During Unemployment\nNo Freelance, No Benefits, No Income: 1 in 3 Job Seekers Survive on Nothing\nOver one-third of unemployed individuals have no income source whatsoever during their job search, creating a financial reality for millions navigating career transitions.\nWhile freelance work emerges as the most popular income strategy at 20%, followed closely by employment insurance benefits at 19%, these options combined still reach less than half of those seeking work.\nThe data reveals a troubling gap: even as the gig economy expands and government safety nets exist, a significant portion of job seekers face complete income loss.\nPassive income side hustles and part-time jobs round out the income options at 14% and 11% respectively, but their relatively small percentages underscore how difficult it is to maintain financial stability between full-time positions.\n41% of Unemployed Women Have Zero Income vs. 31% of Men: The Gender Gap Crisis\nWomen face a staggering unemployment income gap, with 41% reporting zero earnings compared to just 31% of men\u2014a disparity that translates to real financial hardship for thousands of job seekers.\nThe freelance economy appears to favor male workers dramatically, with men being 65% more likely to generate income through gig work during unemployment (25% vs 15%).\nWhile government safety nets reach both genders equally at around 19%, this leaves the vast majority to fend for themselves. The data exposes a troubling reality: when traditional employment disappears, women are significantly more likely to find themselves without any financial lifeline, while men more readily pivot to independent work.\nThis gender divide in unemployment survival strategies suggests deeper systemic barriers that prevent equal access to alternative income sources when they're needed most.\nMillennials Weather Unemployment Better Than Any Generation\nMillennials have cracked the unemployment income code while their generational neighbors struggle to stay afloat financially.\nNearly half of Gen Z and Boomers\u2014despite being at opposite ends of the career spectrum\u2014find themselves with absolutely no income during job loss, a crushing reality that defies conventional wisdom about experience and adaptability.\nThe data reveals Millennials as the gig economy champions, with one in four turning to freelance work compared to just 16% of Gen Z, who instead rely heavily on part-time jobs at rates that dwarf every other generation.\nMeanwhile, Gen X emerges as the unemployment insurance generation, claiming benefits at rates 28% higher than Gen Z, yet paradoxically rejecting part-time work almost entirely at just 4.6%.\nThis generational divide exposes how age shapes not just career prospects but survival strategies, with younger workers cobbling together multiple income streams while older generations bet heavily on single sources that may or may not materialize.\nInterview Take-Home Projects\nFree Labor Interview Projects\nInterview or Exploitation? Half of Job Seekers Report Doing Free Work to Get Hired\nNearly half of today's job seekers are essentially working for free during their interview process.\nPicture this: spending hours, sometimes days, crafting detailed marketing strategies, designing product mockups, or writing comprehensive business analyses\u2014all under the guise of \"assessment.\"\nThese aren't simple skills tests; they're full-fledged projects that companies could easily implement or profit from. The line between legitimate evaluation and unpaid consulting has become so blurred that candidates now joke about charging invoicing fees for their interview \"homework.\"\nWhat started as a way to assess practical skills has morphed into a system where desperate job seekers provide free labor, hoping their unpaid work might finally land them a paying position.\nHalf of Men and Women Work for Free in Interviews\nThe gender breakdown reveals a surprising twist in the free labor interview experience.\nWhile female and male job seekers report nearly identical rates of completing unpaid interview projects\u2014hovering right around the 50% mark\u2014non-binary candidates tell a strikingly different story.\nOnly 29% of non-binary respondents say they've been asked to complete work that felt like free labor, compared to their cisgender counterparts.\nThis dramatic difference raises intriguing questions:\n- Are non-binary individuals applying to different types of roles or companies with more ethical hiring practices?\n- Are they more selective about which interview processes they're willing to engage with?\n- Are they more likely to walk away when asked to complete extensive unpaid work?\nWhatever the reason, this data suggests that the interview experience varies significantly across gender identities, with non-binary job seekers somehow dodging the unpaid labor bullet that hits half of all other candidates.\nWhy Half of Workers Under 60 Do Free Labor to Get Jobs\nThe generational divide in unpaid interview work tells a story of changing workplace expectations.\nThree generations, Gen Z, Millennials, and Gen X, are locked in a near-perfect 50/50 split, with roughly half of each cohort reporting they've completed interview projects that felt like free labor.\nThis remarkable consistency across three decades of workers suggests that extensive unpaid assessments have become a standard gatekeeping mechanism in modern hiring.\nBut then there's the plot twist: Baby Boomers. Only one-third of Boomer respondents have experienced this practice, making them twice as likely as younger generations to escape unpaid interview assignments.\nWhether this reflects their seniority, their industries, or simply their power to say \"no\" to unreasonable requests, Boomers appear to operate in a different hiring universe, one where proving your worth doesn't require working for free.\nThe data paints a clear picture: if you were born after 1965, there's a coin-flip chance your next job interview will include an unpaid consulting gig.\n58% of Minimum Wage Seekers Do Free Labor for Interviews\nThe relationship between salary expectations and unpaid interview work defies conventional wisdom.\nYou might expect that higher-paying positions would demand more rigorous assessments, but the data tells a different story, one shaped like a U. Job seekers at the bottom of the salary ladder, those pursuing positions under $30,000, face the highest rate of free labor requests at nearly 58%.\nThe rate drops significantly for middle-income positions, bottoming out at 43% for the $30,000-$49,999 range. But then something unexpected happens: as salary expectations climb, so does the likelihood of doing unpaid work, reaching 55% for those seeking $150,000+ positions. This U-shaped pattern suggests two distinct exploitation dynamics at play.\nAt the low end, desperate job seekers competing for scarce opportunities may feel they have no choice but to complete whatever is asked. At the high end, companies may justify extensive unpaid projects as necessary to assess complex skills for senior roles.\nOnly in the middle, where workers have some leverage but positions aren't prestigious enough to justify elaborate assessments, do job seekers find relative refuge from the free labor trap.\nPay Transparency Response\nPay Transparency Application Rate\n77% of Candidates Still Apply When Employers Hide the Pay\nDespite the growing push for salary transparency in job postings, a striking 77.4% of job seekers still apply to positions even when compensation isn't disclosed.\nThis overwhelming majority suggests that candidates are willing to invest their time and effort in the application process despite the uncertainty around pay.\nOnly about 1 in 4 job seekers (22.6%) take a firm stance against this practice, choosing to skip opportunities that don't provide upfront salary information.\nThis behavior reveals an interesting dynamic: while candidates increasingly value transparency, most are still willing to engage with employers who keep their cards close to their chest regarding compensation.\nWhether driven by curiosity, necessity, or optimism about negotiating power, the vast majority of applicants aren't letting missing salary data stop them from throwing their hat in the ring.\nSocial Media and the Job Search\nSocial Media Hiring\n1 in 3 Job Seekers Credit Social Media for Getting Noticed or Hired\nSocial media's impact on job searching appears to be mixed but generally neutral to positive. The majority of job seekers (52.3%) report that social media has had no discernible impact on their job search efforts.\nHowever, a substantial portion (34.5%) found social media beneficial, reporting it helped them get noticed or hired.\nThis suggests that while social media isn't a game-changer for everyone, it can be a valuable tool for roughly one-third of job seekers. Notably, negative experiences are rare, with only 4.8% reporting that social media hurt their chances.\nAdditionally, 8.4% don't use social media at all, indicating that while most job seekers are on social platforms, it's still possible to conduct a job search without them.\nThese findings suggest that job seekers should view social media as a potentially helpful but not essential tool in their job search toolkit, with relatively low risk of negative consequences.\nMen Win at Social Media Job Hunting: 40% Report Success vs. 27% of Women\nMale job seekers are significantly more likely to leverage social media successfully in their job search, with 99 out of 243 men reporting it helped them get noticed or hired, a contrast to the 53 out of 197 women who experienced the same benefit.\nThis gender gap reveals a compelling story: while nearly 60% of female job seekers feel social media has no impact on their search, men appear to be cracking the code, with over 40% reporting positive outcomes.\nThe disparity suggests that either men are more effectively using platforms like LinkedIn to network and showcase their skills, or that recruiters and hiring managers may be responding differently to male versus female profiles.\nInterestingly, women are also more likely to avoid social media altogether in their job search, with 21 female respondents opting out entirely compared to just 16 men.\nDespite these differences, both genders overwhelmingly avoid negative consequences, with fewer than 6% from either group reporting that social media hurt their chances.\nJob Search Sentiment\nEmotional Toll of Job Search\n1 in 3 Job Seekers Feel Exhausted in Their Search\nEmotions run the full spectrum among job seekers, with 164 respondents (36%) maintaining a hopeful outlook despite the challenges they face.\nHowever, the majority tell a different story: 137 individuals (30.1%) report feeling exhausted from their search efforts, while another 113 people (24.8%) describe themselves as stuck, unable to gain traction in their pursuit of new opportunities.\nThe remaining 41 respondents (9%) feel overwhelmed by the process altogether. This emotional landscape reveals a job market where optimism persists for roughly one in three seekers, but the combined weight of exhaustion, stagnation, and overwhelm affects nearly two-thirds of those actively looking for work, painting a picture of a challenging environment where resilience is constantly tested.\nWomen Report Double the Rate of Feeling Overwhelmed in Job Search\nGender shapes the emotional landscape of job searching in striking ways. While male job seekers lead with optimism, 99 men (40.7%) report feeling hopeful compared to just 60 women (30.5%), female job seekers carry a heavier emotional burden, with 67 women (34%) describing themselves as exhausted versus 65 men (26.7%).\nThe gender gap becomes even more pronounced when examining feelings of being overwhelmed: 25 women (12.7%) struggle with this intense stress compared to only 13 men (5.3%), suggesting women face more than double the emotional pressure during their job search.\nAmong the 66 men and 45 women who feel stuck, both genders show similar frustration levels (27.2% and 22.8% respectively), indicating that the sensation of hitting a wall transcends gender lines.\nThe small cohort of non-binary respondents offers an intriguing contrast, 3 out of 7 (42.9%) maintain hope despite facing a job market that often lacks inclusive practices, while those who prefer not to disclose their gender identity show the highest exhaustion rate at 37.5%, hinting at additional barriers they may encounter in their search.\nGen Z Jobseekers Are Hopeful, Gen X Battle Exhaustion\nGeneration Z emerges as the most optimistic cohort, with 34 out of 81 young professionals (42%) maintaining hope despite entering one of the most challenging employment landscapes in decades.\nThis youthful optimism sharply contrasts with Generation X's experience, where exhaustion dominates, 48 of 131 Gen Xers (36.6%) report feeling drained, carrying the heaviest emotional burden of any generation. Millennials, who dominate the job-seeking population with 225 respondents, find themselves split between hope and hardship: while 83 (36.9%) remain hopeful, another 64 (28.4%) feel exhausted and 56 (24.9%) describe themselves as stuck.\nThe most striking finding emerges from Baby Boomers, where despite their smaller numbers, 8 out of 18 (44.4%) feel stuck, the highest percentage of any generation experiencing this particular frustration. This suggests that older workers face unique challenges in navigating modern hiring practices.\nAcross all generations, the feeling of being overwhelmed remains remarkably consistent at 8-10%, indicating that while each generation faces distinct challenges, the intensity of pressure remains relatively stable.\nThe data reveals a clear exhaustion trajectory that peaks with Gen X, suggesting that mid-career professionals bear the brunt of job search fatigue, caught between the optimism of youth and the resignation that can come with experience.\nLayoff Fears\nLayoff Anticipation Fears\nNearly Half of Job Seekers Fear Future Layoffs\nNearly half of job seekers are losing sleep over layoff fears. Out of 455 professionals surveyed, a striking 215 individuals (47.3%) admit they're worried about being laid off from their current or next job.\nThis anxiety isn't just a small pocket of pessimism, it represents almost half the workforce living with the constant fear that their next meeting might be their last. Meanwhile, 240 respondents (52.7%) say they're not worried, suggesting either remarkable job security or perhaps a touch of optimism in an increasingly uncertain market.\nThe near-even split reveals a workforce divided: for every person confidently planning their next career move, there's another nervously refreshing their email, dreading that automated \"Can we talk?\" message from HR.\nWomen Perfectly Divided on Layoff Fears While 55% of Men Feel Secure\nThe gender divide on job security reveals a striking contrast: while 55.1% of men (134 out of 243) sleep soundly without layoff fears, women are split right down the middle... literally.\nAmong 197 female professionals, the anxiety is perfectly balanced: 98 women worry about losing their jobs while 99 don't, creating an exact 49.7% to 50.3% split that couldn't be more evenly matched if it tried. Men show notably more confidence in their job security, with only 44.9% (109) expressing layoff concerns.\nBut the real anxiety spike appears in smaller demographics: those who prefer not to disclose their gender show the highest worry levels at 62.5% (5 out of 8), while non-binary respondents land closer to the male confidence levels with only 42.9% (3 out of 7) worried.\nThis data paints a picture where gender identity correlates with job security confidence, men feeling safest, women perfectly torn, and those keeping their identity private harboring the deepest concerns.\nGen X at 55% vs Gen Z at 40.7%: The Layoff Anxiety Gap Widens\nGen X is having a midlife crisis about job security. While 55% of Gen Xers (72 out of 131) lie awake worrying about pink slips, their younger counterparts are surprisingly chill, only 40.7% of Gen Z workers (33 out of 81) share those fears.\nThe generational anxiety ladder tells a compelling story: as workers age from their twenties into their forties, layoff worries steadily climb. Gen Z starts with relative confidence at 40.7% worried, Millennials inch up to 46.2% (104 out of 225 worried), then Gen X hits the anxiety peak at 55%. But here's the plot twist; Baby Boomers flip the script entirely.\nOnly 6 out of 18 Boomers (33.3%) worry about losing their jobs, making them the most secure-feeling generation of all. Perhaps it's the proximity to retirement, accumulated experience, or simply having survived enough economic downturns to know they'll weather another.\nMeanwhile, Gen X finds themselves in the precarious middle, too young to retire, too expensive to keep, watching as 72 of their peers nervously refresh LinkedIn while 59 try to convince themselves everything's fine.\nPost-Layoff Fears\nDespite AI Hype, Workers More Worried About Paying Bills Than Robot Replacements\nFinancial insecurity emerges as the overwhelming concern dominating the minds of today's workforce, with nearly 6 out of 10 professionals citing it as their primary layoff fear.\nThis reality reveals a workforce living paycheck to paycheck, where job loss doesn't just mean career disruption, it means potential financial ruin. The second greatest fear, supporting family members, affects more than 1 in 4 workers and underscores how employment anxiety extends far beyond personal concerns to encompass the wellbeing of loved ones.\nInterestingly, despite widespread media coverage about AI disruption, only a small fraction of workers actually fear being replaced by automation, suggesting that immediate financial pressures far outweigh futuristic technology concerns.\nThe data paints a picture of a workforce more worried about paying bills and maintaining health coverage than adapting to artificial intelligence, highlighting how traditional economic anxieties continue to shape modern career fears.\nHiring Discrimination Trends\nIdentity Discrimination\nNearly Half of Job Seekers Report Facing Hiring Discrimination Based on Identity\nNearly half of job seekers (47.9%, or 218 out of 455 respondents) believe their race, gender, sexual orientation, or background has negatively impacted their hiring chances.\nThis finding reveals a job market where perceived discrimination affects almost as many people as those who report no bias (45.9%, or 209 respondents).\nOnly a small fraction (6.2%, or 28 respondents) preferred not to disclose their experiences. The near-even split between those reporting discrimination and those who don't suggests that bias in hiring remains a pervasive issue, with marginalized candidates facing additional barriers beyond skills and qualifications when seeking employment.\nThe Further from Male Norms, the Steeper the Hiring Bias\nGender identity dramatically shapes experiences of hiring discrimination, with those who prefer not to disclose their gender facing the harshest reality,62.5% (5 out of 8) report their identity has blocked job opportunities.\nNon-binary job seekers face similar odds, with 57.1% (4 out of 7) believing they've been passed over due to who they are.\nWomen encounter discrimination at alarming rates, with 52.3% (103 out of 197) reporting bias, meaning more than half of female candidates believe their gender has cost them a job.\nEven men, traditionally viewed as less affected by gender bias, report significant discrimination at 43.6% (106 out of 243).\nThe pattern is unmistakable: the further someone's identity deviates from traditional male norms, the more likely they are to face barriers in the hiring process.\nWith 218 total respondents across all genders reporting discrimination, these numbers reveal a job market where identity often matters as much as, or more than, qualifications.\nJob Seekers Who Experience Discrimination Set Higher Salary Expectations\nAmong 416 job seekers surveyed, a striking pattern emerges: those who believe discrimination has hurt their hiring chances consistently aim for higher compensation targets.\nIt's important to note that 28 selected \"Prefer not to say\" to the discrimination question, while 13 chose \"Prefer not to say\" for the salary question, two people had selected the answer for both, so 39 were removed from this sample.\nOf the 212 respondents who reported experiencing discrimination, 69.3% expect salaries of $75,000 or above, compared to just 58.9% of the 204 respondents who haven't faced such barriers.\nThe gap is particularly pronounced at entry-level positions, where only 4.7% of discrimination-experienced job seekers expect under $30,000 annually, versus 11.3% of their counterparts.\nThis 10.4 percentage point difference suggests that those who perceive bias in hiring may be strategically positioning themselves for higher-paying roles, possibly viewing increased compensation as validation of their worth or as a buffer against workplace inequities.\nThe data reveals a complex dynamic where discrimination experience appears to fuel higher salary ambitions, with nearly a quarter (23.6%) of affected job seekers targeting the $75,000-$99,999 range compared to 17.2% of those without discrimination experiences.\nThis trend could reflect either a defensive career strategy, where marginalized workers demand premium compensation to offset perceived disadvantages, or an empowered approach where past discrimination motivates individuals to pursue roles that better recognize their value and expertise.\nMillennials and Gen X Bear the Brunt of Workplace Discrimination\nIn a striking revelation about generational experiences in the job market, over half of Millennials and Gen X workers report facing discrimination during their careers, painting a troubling picture of bias in hiring practices.\nAmong 225 Millennials surveyed, a staggering 50.7% (114 individuals) believe their race, gender, sexual orientation, or background has hindered their job prospects, while Gen X shows an even higher rate at 51.1% (67 of 131 respondents).\nThis stands in sharp contrast to the bookend generations: Gen Z workers report discrimination at just 37.0% (30 of 81 respondents), while Baby Boomers experience it at 38.9% (7 of 18 respondents).\nThe data reveals a concerning \"discrimination peak\" that strikes workers in their prime career years, those aged roughly 28-59, when professionals are typically competing for leadership roles, career advancement, and higher-stakes positions.\nInterestingly, Gen Z's lower discrimination rates may reflect their relative newcomer status in the workforce, while Baby Boomers' similar rates could indicate either genuine lower discrimination or the privilege of seniority.\nWhat's particularly notable is that 12.3% of Gen Z respondents (10 people) chose not to disclose their discrimination experiences, the highest \"prefer not to say\" rate among all generations, suggesting that workplace bias discussions may still feel risky for the youngest workers entering today's professional landscape.\nAge Discrimination\n47% of Job Seekers Report Ageism During Job Search Process\nNearly half of job seekers are encountering age discrimination in their pursuit of employment, with 215 out of 455 respondents (47.3%) reporting some form of ageism during their job search.\nThe most pervasive tactic employers use is telling candidates they're \"overqualified,\" affecting 93 people (20.4% of all job seekers), a euphemism that often masks age bias behind seemingly legitimate concerns.\nTech skills discrimination follows as the second most common form, with 43 job seekers (9.5%) having their ability to adapt or technical competence questioned based on age assumptions.\nBeyond these subtle approaches, 34 candidates (7.5%) faced the unfortunate reality of losing out to younger applicants, while 32 others (7.0%) were immediately dismissed after sharing salary expectations that likely reflected their years of experience.\nMost troubling, 13 job seekers (2.9%) endured direct comments about their age or retirement plans during interviews \u2013 a brazen violation that reveals how normalized ageism has become in hiring practices.\nWhile 240 job seekers (52.7%) haven't experienced age discrimination, the data exposes a hiring landscape where nearly every other experienced professional faces barriers that have nothing to do with their qualifications.\n72% of Gen X Job Seekers Face Age Discrimination \u2013 Nearly Double the Rate of Millennials\nThe brutal reality of age discrimination in the job market reveals a generational divide that hits like a wall at age 40. Generation X workers face the highest rates of age discrimination at 72.5%, with 95 out of 131 job seekers in this cohort reporting some form of ageism during their search.\nBaby Boomers experience virtually identical discrimination at 72.2% (13 out of 18 respondents), suggesting that once workers cross into their late 40s and beyond, age bias becomes an almost universal barrier regardless of their actual age within that range.\nThe contrast with younger generations is staggering: while Millennials face a concerning but more manageable 40.0% discrimination rate (90 out of 225 job seekers), Generation Z enjoys relative protection with only 21.0% experiencing age-related bias (17 out of 81 respondents).\nThis data exposes a career cliff where the likelihood of facing age discrimination more than triples between Millennials and Gen X, creating a hiring landscape where experience becomes a liability rather than an asset, and where workers over 40 must navigate a job market where nearly three-quarters of their peers encounter age-based barriers to employment.\nMen More Likely to Face Age Discrimination Than Women\nMale job seekers face a surprisingly higher burden of age discrimination than their female counterparts, with 51.9% of men (126 out of 243) experiencing some form of ageism compared to 42.6% of women (84 out of 197) \u2013 a gap of 9.3 percentage points that reveals men are 1.22 times more likely to encounter age-based bias during their job search.\nThis gender disparity challenges conventional assumptions about workplace discrimination, showing that while nearly half of all job seekers face age-related barriers, men bear a disproportionate share of the burden.\nThe data suggests that male workers may be particularly vulnerable to certain types of age discrimination, possibly due to different stereotypes and expectations placed on male versus female candidates, or varying perceptions about older men's adaptability, salary expectations, and career longevity.\nWith more than half of male job seekers reporting age discrimination experiences, this represents a significant obstacle for men navigating career transitions and job searches, particularly as they advance in their careers and face increasingly hostile hiring environments that seem to penalize male experience and seniority at higher rates than female experience.\nMental Health Resignations\nQuitting for Mental Health\n1 in 3 Workers Have Quit Their Job for Mental Health Reasons\nMental health has emerged as a critical factor in modern workplace decisions, with a striking 137 out of 455 professionals, nearly one in three (30.1%), having made the difficult choice to leave their job for mental health reasons. This significant proportion reveals that mental well-being isn't just a personal concern but a workplace reality that's driving major career decisions across industries.\nWhile the majority of 318 respondents (69.9%) haven't reached this breaking point, the substantial minority who have taken this step highlights the urgent need for employers to prioritize mental health support and create psychologically safe work environments.\nThe fact that 137 individuals were willing to sacrifice job security and income for their mental well-being underscores just how severe workplace mental health challenges have become.\nWomen 40% More Likely Than Men to Quit Jobs for Mental Health Reasons\nThe intersection of gender identity and mental health job departures reveals striking disparities in workplace experiences.\nAmong the 455 survey respondents, female professionals show a significantly higher likelihood of leaving jobs for mental health reasons, with 69 out of 197 women (35.0%) making this difficult decision compared to 61 out of 243 men (25.1%).\nThe pattern becomes even more pronounced among smaller gender identity groups, where non-binary respondents reported the highest rate at 42.9% (3 out of 7), and those who prefer not to disclose their gender identity showed an alarming 50% rate (4 out of 8 respondents).\nThis 10-percentage-point gap between female and male respondents, combined with the even higher rates among non-binary and non-disclosed gender identities, suggests that marginalized gender groups face disproportionate mental health challenges in the workplace, potentially due to discrimination, lack of inclusive policies, or additional stressors related to their identity in professional environments.\nMillennials More Than Twice as Likely as Gen Z to Quit Jobs for Mental Health\nThe generational divide in workplace mental health reveals a striking pattern that challenges assumptions about younger workers' resilience. Millennials lead the exodus from jobs for mental health reasons, with an alarming 85 out of 225 respondents (37.8%) making this difficult choice, more than double the rate of any other generation.\nGeneration X follows at 35 out of 131 (26.7%), while surprisingly, the youngest workers in Generation Z show the lowest rate at just 14 out of 81 (17.3%), and Baby Boomers at 3 out of 18 (16.7%).\nThis data suggests that Millennials, now in their prime working years, are bearing the brunt of workplace mental health challenges, possibly due to entering their careers during economic uncertainty, facing intense workplace demands, or having greater awareness and willingness to prioritize mental health over traditional job security.\nStaying for the Benefits\nGolden Handcuff Retention\nHalf of Workers Stay in Jobs They Hate to Keep Their Benefits, Equity, or Visa\nThe modern workplace presents a distinct reality: professionals are trapped in jobs they dislike, held hostage by the very benefits meant to support them.\nWhile nearly half of workers have the luxury of walking away from unsatisfying positions, the majority find themselves in a different predicament, trading daily fulfillment for long-term security.\nThe golden handcuffs of healthcare benefits, retirement plans, and insurance coverage keep the largest group of these reluctant employees tethered to their desks, unwilling to risk losing coverage that could cost thousands of dollars to replace.\nMeanwhile, a smaller but determined segment endures workplace misery for the promise of equity payouts, betting their present happiness against future financial freedom.\nAt the far end of this spectrum, visa-dependent workers face perhaps the most difficult choice of all, staying in jobs they despise because leaving could mean losing their legal right to remain in the country.\nThis reality exposes fundamental tension: the gap between what we need to survive and what we need to thrive, forcing millions to choose security over satisfaction in a system where having both feels increasingly out of reach.\nLower-Income Workers More Likely to Quit Bad Jobs Than High Earners\nThe American workplace reveals a cruel irony: those who earn the least possess the most freedom to escape toxic jobs, while high earners find themselves imprisoned by their own success.\nLower-income workers, earning under $75,000, demonstrate a remarkable willingness to walk away from positions that damage their wellbeing, with over half choosing to leave rather than endure misery for a paycheck. These workers, often living paycheck to paycheck, understand that no amount of money is worth sacrificing their mental health and dignity.\nIn contrast, six-figure earners become increasingly trapped as their salaries climb, with those earning over $150,000 being the most likely to remain in jobs they despise.\nThe cruel mathematics of modern employment means that premium health insurance, generous retirement matching, and stock options create golden handcuffs that tighten with every raise.\nWhat appears to be financial freedom actually becomes a prison, where the very benefits designed to improve quality of life end up destroying it by making escape financially impossible.\nJob Search Challenges\nJob Seeker Struggles\n1 in 5 Job Seekers Say Application Processes Are Their Biggest Career Obstacle\nThe Q2 2025 job search landscape reveals a challenging environment where job seekers face multiple systemic barriers. The top challenge is the Application Process (77 respondents), with candidates frustrated by repetitive form-filling on antiquated systems like Workday and Oracle, despite already providing comprehensive resumes.\nThis is closely followed by No Response/Ghosting (45 respondents), where employers fail to provide basic feedback or acknowledgment, leaving candidates in uncertainty after investing significant time and effort in applications and interviews.\nTechnology-related challenges are also prominent, with AI/Automation Issues affecting 31 respondents who struggle with impersonal, poorly implemented AI screening systems that often fail to properly evaluate candidates.\nThe Interview Process (50 respondents) presents additional hurdles through lengthy multi-round assessments and testing procedures that sometimes feel like unpaid labor. Perhaps most concerning is the emergence of Fake/Questionable Jobs (4 respondents), where job seekers question the legitimacy of postings, suspecting companies already have internal candidates or are using postings for data collection rather than genuine hiring.\nThese challenges collectively paint a picture of a hiring ecosystem that has become increasingly impersonal, inefficient, and sometimes deceptive, creating significant friction for job seekers trying to navigate an already competitive market.\nSalary Expectations\nJob Seeker Salary Expectations\nSix-Figure Dreams: 43% of Job Seekers Target $100K+ Salaries\nThe job market is witnessing a dramatic shift in salary expectations, with job seekers setting their sights remarkably high. Nearly half of all professionals are now targeting six-figure salaries, refusing to settle for anything less than $100,000 annually.\nThe most coveted salary bracket has become the $100,000-$149,999 range, attracting over one in five job seekers, while an equally ambitious group is pushing even further, demanding over $150,000. What's particularly striking is how few professionals are willing to accept lower-tier positions \u2013 only 33 respondents are considering roles under $30,000, signaling a fundamental transformation in how workers value their skills and time.\nThis isn't just optimism; it's a reflection of a job market where talent holds unprecedented leverage, and professionals are finally demanding compensation that matches their worth.\nGet More Interviews, Faster\nHuntr streamlines your job search.

      "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/11/26/13-skills-to-put-on-your-resume-for-remote-jobs-in-2025/",
      "text": "Have you ever applied for a remote job and noted it said something like, \"remote work proficiency,\" or \"previous experience working remotely preferred,\" or similar, and it left you scratching your head wondering what exactly the hiring manager was looking for?\nWell if you're in doubt, it simply means that they want candidates who are not only looking for remote work because of the benefits it can provide them, but the company wants candidates who genuinely thrive in remote work environments and can deliver their best work and collaborate meaningfully with their co-workers around the world (or across the country). To improve your chances of landing a remote job, you need to have the right mix of skills\u2014technical and non-technical\u2014to stand out in a competitive job market that is clamoring for remote work.\n13 Skills To Include In Your Resume For 2025\nLet's take a look at the top 13 skills that help your resume shine and demonstrate your capability for delivering high performance in a remote work setting:\n1. Communication Skills\nWe already know that communication skills are pivotal to an organization's success. But this impact is more keenly felt when said organization is operating remotely or on a hybrid-remote basis. Lack of clear, transparent, timely, and respectful communication using the right channels can be detrimental to a new project's success, for example.\n2. Time Management\nDo you have a method that you swear by that helps you to prioritize and manage tasks and deadlines and maintain productivity without being under direct supervision in the office? If you've found some effective techniques for project-managing your own work and schedule, be sure to reference it. This might even arise as a question in your job interview, so be prepared.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n3. Digital Collaboration Tools\nDigital collaboration tools such as Google Workspace, Teams and Microsoft Office, and Slack are good examples that you can use to show proficiency and experience in remote work. And if you're not familiar with these yet, undertake a crash course and play around with the different features until you're comfortable.\n4. Focus\nNow this is a really hard one for many professionals, even in the office, where we're accustomed to checking our phones or chatting every few minutes. But the temptation to lose focus intensifies when working from home as there are so many things that you can do during work time. The key is to find balance.\nWhile doing the laundry in between meetings might be innocent, endlessly browsing social media when in a meeting with your camera off, while relying on AI to fill you in on anything you've missed, is clearly not demonstrating engagement.\nOnce you've set your mind to engage in a task, give it your 100%. Anything less than this slows down your growth and productivity, and it can even cause you to lose out on key career-building opportunities.\n5. Problem-Solving Skills\nAs a remote worker, you'll often encounter difficulties and emergencies that require you to think and act on your feet to ensure the most effective and quickest possible solution. For example, what would you do in basic scenarios such as time zone conflicts, technical issues impeding your work, issues arising from a project you're collaborating on, or conflicts and misunderstandings with stakeholders? Do you have what it takes to get to the root cause and tackle the problem creatively?\nSome other remote work skills worth the mention in your resume include:\n- Adaptability\n- Tech savviness\n- Emotional intelligence\n- Writing skills (for emails, chats, and reports)\n- Project management skills\n- Leadership skills and mentoring (if you can demonstrate how you have been proactive in displaying leadership qualities and mentoring your team members in your last remote role, this is a huge bonus)\n- Data literacy\n- Customer-centric skills and focus\nNow that you know what skills are best to include for your applications for remote jobs, the question is, how do you include them? Do you list all or some of them? The best approach is to mention a few (especially your tech skills and proficiency in virtual collaboration tools) in your skills section of the resume, and scatter examples that demonstrate how you have displayed these traits, all throughout your resume.\nFor example, listing your non-mandatory certifications that you undertook while at work, or how you adapted to feedback and improved output by a certain percentage, demonstrates a growth mindset and points to emotional intelligence skills. You've got to think creatively, and intersperse these remote job skills as keywords throughout the document, while providing tangible examples.\nYour remote job is ready for you in 2025. So what are you doing to demonstrate that you're competent for it?"
