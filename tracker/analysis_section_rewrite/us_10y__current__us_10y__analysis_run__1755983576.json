      "feedback": "Your draft is too vague and lacks the rigor expected for a 0–3‑week horizon analysis. Rewrite it to start with a clear, data‑driven causal chain: Russia’s capture of Sredneye/Kleban‑Byk → closer to Kostiantynivka → pressure on Kyiv’s defensive line (cite ID 7YQN9WX3). Add the immediate trigger (U.S. Trump‑led mediation stalled, Lavrov’s “no meeting” statement) and the market reaction function (expect a 1–3 % dip in defense‑sector ETFs, a 0.5 % rise in Russian‑linked stocks). State precise thresholds: if Russia advances to Kostiantynivka, expect a 2 % sell‑off in U.S. defense funds; if a summit is announced, a 1 % rally. Include invalidation points (e.g., if Lavrov reverses stance, the sell‑off may reverse). Monitor next: Lavrov’s statements, U.S. Treasury sanctions announcements, and Ukrainian counter‑offensives. For the U.S. immigration story, quantify the impact: the preliminary injunction protects 30 jurisdictions (ID U1KRCQOYR) → potential $X billion in federal funding that could be withheld → a 0.3 % drag on the S&P 500. Specify catalysts: judge’s injunction, Trump’s appeal, potential reversal of the order. Add a short‑term reaction function: expect a 0.2 % dip in the S&P 500 and a 0.5 % rise in the “sanctuary” index. Ensure every claim is backed by a source ID, avoid generic statements, and reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., differing numbers on funding amounts). Finally, tighten the narrative: use bullet‑style key points, keep the paragraph under 200 words, and end with a clear “what to watch next” sentence.",
