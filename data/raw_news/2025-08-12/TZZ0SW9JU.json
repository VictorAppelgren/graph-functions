  "description": "The frosted sugar cookies were sold at Target stores in Illinois and 20 other states.",
  "content": "ILLINOIS \u2014 More than 12,000 packages of frosted sugar cookies sold at Target stores in Illinois and 20 other states have been recalled over fears that they could be contaminated with pieces of wood, the FDA announced.\n\nThe recall affects 10-count packages of Favorite Day Bakery Frosted Sugar Cookies from three distribution centers that were sold in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Missouri, North Carolina, North Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia and Vermont. The cookies were possibly contaminated with wood, according to the FDA report, which classified the action as a Class II recall, one in which \"the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\" No illnesses have yet been reported, according to ABC Chicago.\n\nMore than 800 cases of the cookies have been recalled. The lot number on the cookies is 25195. \"Best By Date can vary as they are applied by retailer when removed from freezer,\" according to the FDA. The recall was first initiated on July 22 by Canada's Give and Go Prepared Foods Corp.\n\nTarget said customers who may have bought the cookies to call for a refund. \"At Target, we're committed to providing high quality and safe products for our guests,\" a Target spokesperson said in an email. \"Following the voluntary recall initiated by Give and Go Prepared Food Corps, Target has removed all impacted Favorite Day Bakery Frosted Sugar Cookies, 10 count, from stores and online. If guests previously purchased these products, they can call Target Guest Relations at 1-800-440-0680 for a full refund.\"",
