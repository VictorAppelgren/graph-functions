  "content": "Ahead of its world premiere at this year\u2019s New York Film Festival, the first trailer for \u201cAnemone,\u201d actor Daniel Day-Lewis\u2019 first film in 8 years, has been unveiled.\n\nThe drama marks the feature directorial debut of Day-Lewis\u2019 son, Ronan, who also co-wrote the script for \u201cAnemone\u201d with his father. Details about the film have been kept under tight wraps in the months since it was originally announced that Day-Lewis would be coming out of retirement for the project.\n\u2022 None \u2018Anemone\u2019 Trailer Offers New Look at Daniel Day-Lewis\u2019 First Film in 8 Years\n\u2022 None UTA Signs John Legend and His Get Lifted Banner\n\nThe film follows a middle-aged man (Sean Bean) who reconnects with his estranged, hermit brother (Day-Lewis). Their reunion forces the two men to confront their complicated past, as well as the life-changing events decades prior that altered their bond forever. The first \u201cAnemone\u201d trailer features plenty of surreal imagery, as well as moments of maniacal intensity on Day-Lewis\u2019 part.\n\nYou can check out the trailer yourself below.\n\nIn addition to Day-Lewis and Bean, Samantha Morton (\u201cMinority Report\u201d) also stars in the film. Day-Lewis executive produced it alongside Brad Pitt.\n\n\u201cAnemone\u201d isn\u2019t the first time that Day-Lewis has come out of retirement for a film. In the late 1990s, he also went on a self-imposed hiatus before returning in 2002 to play the violent, charismatic Bill the Butcher in director Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cGangs of New York.\u201d That film was, at the time, Day-Lewis\u2019 first since director Jim Sheridan\u2019s 1997 sports drama \u201cThe Boxer.\u201d\n\nIn the 15 years that followed his return in \u201cGangs of New York,\u201d Day-Lewis appeared in just five movies. He won Oscars for his lead performances in 2007\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d and 2012\u2019s \u201cLincoln\u201d and was nominated again for his performance in 2017\u2019s \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d which marked a reunion between him and \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. In the lead-up to the release of \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Day-Lewis announced that he planned to again retire from acting.\n\nBy the time that \u201cAnemone\u201d makes its theatrical debut this fall, it will have been eight years since \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d was released, which marks the longest gap between projects of Day-Lewis\u2019 career.\n\n\u201cAnemone\u201d will be released in select theaters on Oct. 3, before expanding nationwide a week later on Oct. 10.\n\nThe post \u2018Anemone\u2019 Trailer Offers New Look at Daniel Day-Lewis\u2019 First Film in 8 Years appeared first on TheWrap.",
