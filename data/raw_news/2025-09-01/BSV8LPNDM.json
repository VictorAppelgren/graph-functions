  "title": "Global Economy 'Muddling Through,' Peel Hunt's Kallum Pickering Says",
  "description": "Jobs reports, a key inflation reading and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision all hit over the next 14 trading sessions, setting the tone for investors as they return from summer vacations. The events arrive with the stock market seemingly at a crossroads after the S&P 500 Index posted its smallest monthly gain since July 2024 and heads into September, historically its worst month of the year. Peel Hunt Chief Economist Kallum Pickering joins Caroline Hepker to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Looks like for your outlook, you're kind of broadly optimistic about everything by the U.S.. Why? Well, I think let's just be honest about the U.S. situation. It's not I'm not a pessimist on the U.S., actually. You know, I was I was not in the camp arguing for a recession in April when we had the liberation day. It's just after nearly 3% annualized growth for the best part of two years, slowing to a little bit below 2%. Is is significant weakness. I mean, my my view at the moment, you know, a series of reports I've sent I've called it The Art of Muddling Through, which I think actually is is roughly right. We've got a very significant shock to global demand and supply coming from U.S. trade policy. This is this is anti-growth and at least increases the risks of U.S. inflation. We have two very significant geopolitical events ongoing Israel-Palestine and Russia, Ukraine, with commensurate disruptions to global demand and supply. There's a great degree of policy uncertainty around advanced economies and China when it comes to fiscal. And we're in the U.K. and we highlight the issues in the U.K. gilt market and worries about fiscal policy. But actually, you can throw the U.S. in there with its fiscal problems France, Germany, Japan. We all have fiscal challenges and no one across the advanced world is properly addressing the long term challenges coming from an aging population at a time when deficits and debt are elevated. And you put all of this again. So this is pretty tough. But then when you actually look at the economic data, what you see is actually a story which is global trade and industrial production look set to gradually expand over the next couple of years. U.S. GDP in the last print was revised up. Japanese GDP, U.K. GDP, surprised to the upside in Q2. Actually, economies are withstanding these shocks. The mood is quite bad, but the facts on the ground are actually consistent with just okay growth when muddling through. We're complaining about it a little bit, but actually the risk of things going very badly wrong seems to be fairly low. Yeah, but muddling through is a term that we're so familiar with in the U.K. It's just kind of extraordinary to apply it to the U.S. And also, I think how reliable, for example, is the non-farm payroll data that's coming on Friday as we got that big shock revision recently off of NFP data? Yep. And also that there are such significant challenges to so many institutions from the from the Trump administration trying to reshape the global economy in the U.S. economy. Okay. So we have to distinguish between two things here, which is the cyclical and the structural consequences. So we in markets, I think my view would be the market overestimated the cyclical downside risks of the Trump administration's policies, especially in April and probably at least in the first instance, underestimated the long term consequences for supply potential. We've been here before. I'm sorry to just bring Brexit up, but on the day the UK voted to leave the EU, the consensus was the U.K. would fall into recession in the second half of 2016, which didn't happen. No one would have made the case that, say, U.K. focused funds would have had ten years of outflows. That's roughly what we see now in the U.S. where if you would have asked people on in April with deliberation, deterrence, what's more likely by the middle of the year, the U.S. is in recession or the dollar is depreciated by 15% and we'd be worried about long term institutional strength in America. Say, well, US recession, the dollar is probably going to go through the roof and we can just forget about some of these issues. Actually, that's exactly what we're seeing play out now. We're being surprised with the cyclical strength in America, but we're starting to understand actually what are the long term consequences of all of this. And I think that's actually where currency markets are the best read on the way people are thinking about some of these issues. And is it not so interesting that we were worried? A, for a long time after Brexit and Europeans were worried that maybe Brexit would be a blueprint for other European countries? And guess what? Maybe it's something that we are now applying to the U.S.. I think that's very interesting. In terms of what you're expecting then for the Federal Reserve and Interest, say again, it's a kind of 2026 question, How dovish does the Fed go, I think will get and is there an inflationary shock coming next year? So the Fed, I think it's just worth keeping in mind is a dual mandate. Central bank, the Bank of England, the ECB, the board here is squarely focused on inflation. With the Fed, it's inflation, unemployment, which means the Fed over summer and looking backwards here, has constantly been thinking, are we getting further away from our inflation mandate with these tariffs or are we getting further away from our employment mandate with these tariffs? And that dictates where you move on policy. In all likelihood, based on the evidence, the labour market costs seem to be larger than the inflation cost. So we can have a bit more inflation, maybe a three handle for a while, but actually it's the rest of the labor market which now seem more pronounced. And so the trade offs now incentivize the Fed actually to to start cutting rates. I think we probably get a cut in September. Then let's see what happens. I think most of the cuts will come into into next year. The problem with this is and this is one of the strange ironies with the Trump administration, clearly the administration wants the Fed to cut interest rates the way a central bank cuts interest rates when faced with inflation risks. If the market is to be absolutely convinced that in the end the inflation target will be hit by the central bank. So the way to get the Fed to cut is for Trump actually to say Powell was the best central banker in the world. I've never met such a genius in all my life. He's definitely had to get inflation back to 2% no matter what happens, strengthen the credibility of the Fed so that they can start cutting interest rates when inflation is high. In fact, actually, the moves undermine the Fed. The criticism of Powell, the criticism of the way Fed policy has been set, and that actually reduces the scope for the Fed to cut interest rates as inflation is above target. Yes, I mean, one could counter unless President Trump does do what he wants to do and has said that he wants to do, which is to sort of stack the Fed board and then the narrative. But anyway, that's all speculation. But that comes after I mean, that comes after like in the in the immediate instance, if you really want the Fed to cut interest rates a lot today, the way to do it is to strengthen the Fed. Yeah, let's say to the UK, please, even over the summer. Huge amounts of speculation about what the Labour government is going to do in the autumn budget is it would a windfall tax on banks wealth tax, i.e. housing, Is it about pensions? How do you see the the pressures on the government's budget. So there's, there's, there's, there's a big gap in the case of the UK between the general narrative and the facts on the ground in two respects. First, when it comes to the underlying economy and second, when it comes to the scale of the government's problems. 50 billion in tax increases, 1976 while IMF bail out massive black holes. All of this is just fun to read but is not consistent with the problems the government is facing. Much more likely and I think your economists in a great job as always, calculating this kind of stuff. They probably 20 billion is probably around what the government will have to raise. This is a 3 trillion economy. That's not a huge amount in the grand scheme of things. It's worth also keeping them up borrowing. So far this fiscal year is exactly in line with the Obama's estimates. The OBL will have to revise up its forecast for this year. You had a 1% in March, probably where close to 1.4, maybe from 1.5. And borrowing costs at the ten year horizon are roughly where they were in March, with the last forecast higher admittedly the 30 year, but not by a huge amount. And so when you start actually doing the math, you say you probably need to find probably 15, 20 billion. You will get that from, I think two places. One would be by freezing the income tax thresholds. I wouldn't be surprised actually, if they put fuel duty up this time. I think that probably makes sense. And then you say, what other taxes can you can you raise the challenges? The government unfortunately has lost so much credibility. It's lost control of the economic narrative that any tax increases now will be negative for confidence. And it's amplified by the fact that the government has painted itself into a corner by not properly addressing the welfare spending and the incentives around welfare in tune. And well, that's from close to half of the budget and then the other half of the budget itself. We really don't want to touch like education and health care and defence. And then two thirds of the tax base, which is income tax, VAT and employee national assurance as well, we're not going to raise those taxes. And so you're really limited. You have to look at small pools of tax and potentially large increases, which is why the headlines look so scary because if you start to dramatically increase taxes on things like wealth and other things, you really disturb incentives in the real economy. Okay. That all said, just look at the data for a second. Annualized growth in the first half of the year, 2.2%. Consumer confidence, a little bit below long run average, not a huge amount. PMI is at 53 business confidence up according to the survey. Right. This is not an economy which is stagnating or flatlining, but the mood is dire. We have self-esteem issues. Households are reluctant to spend. It's not that they like the cash. Just very briefly, I got to. Sorry, think there's going to be any taxes on business because that's the most important thing for business. I think there's a significant risk that there's an increase in business taxes. Yes. Just because of the political tradeoffs facing labour.",
