  "description": "",
  "content": "Stocks Kick Off September on a Down Note Amid Rise in Bond Yields\n\nU.S. stocks fell after renewed inflation and debt concerns sparked a global bond selloff. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shed 0.8%, and the S&P 500 fell 0.7%.\n\nGold Just Hit a Record High. These Mining Stocks Are Glistening, Too.\n\nRate-cut bets, tariff uncertainty, and a central bank buying spree have driven the precious metal higher this year.\n\nA 68% decline in shipping costs shows how retailers and manufacturers are pulling back on orders earlier than usual this year.\n\nTrump Tariffs Are Back in Limbo. What Comes Next for the White House, Trade Partners, Companies\n\nCourts have ruled against the legality of the president's tariff plan, raising new questions about trade deals, tariff refunds, and revenue.\n\nAs the cost of government debt spirals amid concerns over fiscal spending, the changing profile of bond investors looks set to further increase the likelihood of yield spikes going forward, according to analysts.\n\nRussia, China Close In on Pipeline Deal, Leaving Beijing With the Upper Hand\n\nThe two countries advanced plans for the long-delayed pipeline to funnel Russian fuel to China but left core terms unresolved, a sign of Beijing's growing leverage.\n\nA long-awaited trade agreement will be presented on Wednesday as Brussels races to secure trade deals while tensions with the U.S. mount.\n\nThirty-year gilt yields hit their highest level since 1998, German 30-year yields were at their highest since 2011 and French 30-year yields reached their highest since 2009.\n\nThe extra levy meant to punish New Delhi for buying cheap Russian crude isn't going as expected.\n\nAnnual inflation picked up pace a little in the eurozone last month, cementing expectations that the ECB will leave interest rates unchanged next week.\n\nMembers of OPEC+ are set to meet Sunday to discuss production policy as the market braces for a global supply glut that is expected to pressure prices.\n\nThe result comes despite weak economic growth, underpinning expectations that the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged next week.\n\nA private gauge of China's manufacturing activity rose to a five-month high, though questions linger over whether the rebound can be sustained.\n\nSouth Korea's headline inflation eased for the second consecutive month to a nine-month low in August, remaining below the central bank's 2% target and paving the way for more rate cuts to support the economy.",
