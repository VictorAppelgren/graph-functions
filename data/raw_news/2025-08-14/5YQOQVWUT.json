  "title": "Steelers offense a mixed bag in joint practice with Bucs; run game \u2018sloppy\u2019",
  "description": "With Aaron Rodgers possibly sitting out all three preseason games, Thursday might have been the best chance to evaluate the QB this summer.",
  "content": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 The 2-yard line is where every Steelers practice begins, with Mike Tomlin\u2019s classic Seven Shots drill. Thursday\u2019s joint practice with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was no different.\n\n\u201cI think we won like 7-0 or 6-1, something like that,\u201d tight end Pat Freiermuth said. \u201cIt was a great showing. I thought we built on that as well throughout the rest of the practice.\u201d\n\nTomlin said that quarterback Aaron Rodgers won\u2019t play in Saturday\u2019s preseason game and has hinted that the veteran may not play at all in the exhibition games. That made the joint practice one of the most game-like environments to evaluate the quarterback against an opposing defense that isn\u2019t the league\u2019s highest-paid. Unfortunately, Steelers policies prohibit media members from reporting anything they \u201csee and hear\u201d in settings that aren\u2019t open to fans, which significantly limits the level of detail that can be provided to fans hungry for intel. However, interviews with players confirmed Thursday was a mixed bag for the first-team offense.\n\n\u201cThere are some things that you\u2019re going to want to clean up, like every day out here,\u201d Freiermuth said. \u201cBut for the most part, I thought it was solid.\u201d\n\nWhile the start of practice was promising, the day ended with an unsuccessful two-minute drill. Freiermuth confirmed the Steelers failed to record a first down during the sequence. Throughout camp, the Steelers had a number of two-minute drills fizzle, including during the Friday Night Lights practice when they failed to pick up a first down. Their best performance to date came on one of the final practices of camp, when they drove into the red zone to put themselves in position to kick a \u201cgame-winning\u201d field goal.\n\n\u201cObviously, with the game on the line, the offense wants to go out there and capitalize,\u201d Freiermuth said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be stuff that we need to figure out on that. But (we have) a lot of confidence. It\u2019s earlier in the process, and so we\u2019ll watch film and get it down.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s success during Seven Shots and the shortcomings in the two-minute drill mirror camp. Rodgers\u2019 ability to fit the ball into tight windows should provide a level of confidence that they can be efficient in the red zone. However, situational football is still a work in progress.\n\nThe Steelers have more than three weeks before their first game. The more time Rodgers has to build a connection with his new receiving corps, the better things should look. The question is: Will the Steelers add another target before the season?\n\n\u201cWe always do our due diligence,\u201d assistant GM Andy Weidl said. \u201cThat\u2019s our job. Any player that becomes available at any position in the league, that\u2019s on us. We have to know the player. If it\u2019s right player, right price, you look at it.\u201d\n\nOften in camp, the Steelers offense had little room to run against the bolstered defensive front. Thursday presented a different kind of challenge. With Buccaneers veteran Vita Vea in the middle of a four-down front \u2014 to go along with 2023 first-round pick Calijah Kancey and edge rusher Yaya Diaby \u2014 the Buccaneers allowed the fourth-fewest rushing yards per game (97.8) and the ninth-fewest yards per carry (4.3) last year. They added free-agent edge rusher Haason Reddick to the mix this offseason.\n\nBased on center Zach Frazier\u2019s assessment, there\u2019s still plenty of room for improvement.\n\n\u201cThey brought a lot of blitzes and pressures and stuff today,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cToday, we were a little sloppy. I feel like we can definitely clean it up. I feel like it\u2019ll definitely even be cleaned up for the game.\u201d\n\nOffensive coordinator Arthur Smith has joked that the Steelers didn\u2019t sign receiver DK Metcalf and Rodgers to \u201crun the wishbone.\u201d A more balanced attack could be on the horizon. That said, the Steelers still want to be a team that uses the run game to take pressure off Rodgers\u2019 right arm and create off play-action.\n\n\u201cI think every day they go out there together, they get better,\u201d Weidl said before the practice. \u201cI think they have the right mindset. If you watch these guys in practice, they come off the field in team (periods), they start running wind sprints. It\u2019s a culture that they\u2019re developing.\n\n\u201cAs a young group, you want to watch them grow together. \u2026 As those guys come up and they gain that experience, they work together, it\u2019s only going to serve them well and serve our team well.\u201d\n\nAs early as Joey Porter Jr.\u2019s rookie year, he often was tasked with shadowing the opponent\u2019s top receiving threat. But when the Steelers revamped their secondary, they added two more alphas \u2014 Ramsey and Darius Slay \u2014 who built their resumes by shutting down WR1s. Ahead of the Steelers\u2019 joint practice, there was no debate about who would get Evans.\n\n\u201cJalen is going to get it,\u201d Tomlin said before practice. \u201cSome people may hate it, and I love that competitive spirit in the collective, but I think it\u2019s already been decided.\u201d\n\nBuccaneers rookie receiver Emeka Egbuka said that Ramsey defended him at times and that the Steelers played more zone coverage than man, which means that Ramsey didn\u2019t take every rep against Evans. However, Egbuka said Evans got the last word with a touchdown during the Buccaneers\u2019 two-minute sequence.\n\n\u201cThose are two All-Pros, two guys competing, wanting to be the best and wanting to get better,\u201d Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles said. \u201cJust as hungry as Jalen is, Mike is as well. So it was a good battle. It was good, friendly competition. Obviously, you got to see the tape. There were no winners. It was just good work.\u201d\n\nOverall, the Steelers defense has often been dominant against the first-team offense in camp. Based on Brandin Echols\u2019 assessment, the Buccaneers were more successful, especially early. Egbuka said the Bucs offense won Seven Shots 4-3.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t come out with the energy,\u201d Echols said. \u201cWe came out a little flatter than usual. We\u2019ve just got to fix that.\u201d\n\nTomlin rules out several veterans for Saturday\n\nTomlin said that the Steelers plan to approach Saturday\u2019s preseason game \u201cvery much like the last one,\u201d when about 20 players rested. He\u2019s already ruled out the following players: QB Rodgers, WR Metcalf, RB Jaylen Warren, TE Freiermuth, TE Jonnu Smith, LG Isaac Seumalo, OLB T.J. Watt, OLB Alex Highsmith, DT Cam Heyward, ILB Patrick Queen, Slay, Ramsey and Porter. Calvin Austin III is still recovering from an abdominal injury, and rookie Yahya Black was spotted with a large wrap on his right elbow during the final training camp practice.",
