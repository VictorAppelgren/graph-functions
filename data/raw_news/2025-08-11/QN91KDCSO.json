  "content": "Kristin Cavallari showed off her incredible figure while enjoying a sunny getaway to Cabo, Mexico over the weekend.\n\nThe Laguna Beach alum, 38, sizzled in a tiny brown bikini as she relaxed by the pool in sultry Instagram snaps she shared from her vacation.\n\nThe star's two-piece swimsuit drew attention to her recent boob job. Kristin had previously shared that she underwent the procedure due to a health issue.\n\nAnother photo captured the mom-of-three floating on her back in a beachfront pool.\n\nThere was also a striking photo of her posing with her back to the camera, her hand entwined in her wet hair.\n\n'Cabo made me do it,' she captioned the post.\n\nHer 4.9 million fans and followers were thrilled, with one writing, 'Kristin you still look as amazing as you did back in your Laguna Beach days.'\n\n'Ok girl you need to share your workout cuz you look amazing!!!!'\n\n'That pool!! The beach! That bod!' someone else chimed in.\n\nThe blonde beauty also took to her Instagram Stories, sharing a leggy snap of herself in a zebra print mini dress inside her hotel room.\n\nElsewhere on her Stories, Kristin gave a glowing endorsement for her beach read, The Compound by Aisling Rawle.\n\nShe shared a photo of the book cover with the caption, 'Can't put it down.'\n\nThe Compound is a dystopian thriller about a young woman named Lily who wakes up on a remote desert compound where she must complete against nineteen other contestants on a popular reality TV show.\n\nIn late May, the jewelry designer announced that she had to have her 'boobs redone' recently after an issue popped up.\n\n'My intuition was saying, redo your boobs. Go get your boobs checked out, at least a consultation,' the reality TV diva shared on her Let's Be Honest podcast.\n\nShe went to a plastic surgeon in Nashville who 'seemed a little concerned' about her right implant.\n\n'What we decided was, \"OK, well, you get in there and see what's going on,\" because we knew something was up,' Cavallari continued.\n\nShe said, 'My boobs were not laying how I wanted them to lay, but just chalked it up to having the implants for eight years. Getting in to see the surgeon confirmed it was much more.\n\n'He gets in there and I have a ruptured implant, and there is no way of knowing how long this implant was ruptured for,' she explained.\n\n'Because my implant was ruptured, my body then formed a huge piece of scar tissue around it, which is good because it, kind of, like, holds it all in place. It's your body's way of protecting itself.'\n\nCavallari added, 'That's why my right boob was definitely not laying right. And it was f***ed up.'\n\nIt was 'crazy' to have that scare.\n\n'I have no idea when that happened. I have no idea how long that's been going on for,' Cavallari continued.\n\nAside from the recent health scare, the star has also been busy with work. Last month Kristin described the type of man she'd like to date next on an episode of her podcast.\n\nThe former MTV personality chatted all things dating with matchmaker Patti Stanger.\n\nThe women were discussing NFL players when Cavallari suddenly had the idea: 'You know what would be great is like, a coach.'\n\nKristin \u2014 whose former NFL star ex-husband Jay Cutler just came under fire \u2014 said she's 'too old for athletes now.'\n\nShe then asked rhetorically: 'Where are the hot coaches?'\n\n'Some of them are hot,' she gushed. 'You'll see a photo and you're like, excuse me, who is that man?'\n\nPatti agreed, 'They're always in their 40s and really sexy, and they have scruff and nice hair.'\n\nWeighing the downside, Kristin added, 'The problem is they work a lot.'\n\nThe blonde bombshell mentioned that she's 'seen a couple coaches' on the exclusive dating app Raya, adding, 'Maybe I should start scrolling again, actually.'\n\nLast year she dated TikTok star Mark Estes for seven months, making headlines for their 13-year age gap.\n\nThe Uncommon James founder was previously married to ex-husband Jay from 2013 until she filed for divorce in 2020. It was finalized in 2022.\n\nThey share sons Camden, 12, Jaxon, 11, and daughter Saylor, nine.",
