  "title": "Why Trump's sweeping new tariffs are fueling stagflation concerns among economists",
  "description": "Economists caution new tariffs could pose economic risks, but the White House says growth is rebounding amid low inflation.",
  "content": "Some economists are cautioning that President Trump's sweeping new tariffs on U.S. trade partners, which took effect Thursday, increase the risks that the U.S. economy could enter a period of stagflation.\n\nA mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation,\" the term describes periods marked by high prices and low GDP growth, such as the economic doldrums of the 1970s. To be sure, U.S. economic growth, though slower so far this year than in 2024, remains relatively strong, and inflation remains far below its post-pandemic spike.\n\nBut economists are flagging the potential for fresh tariffs, which took effect Aug. 7,to fuel higher prices as businesses pass on the costs of the new import duties to consumers. With the latest round of import duties, the effective average tariff rate now stands at 18%, the highest since 1934, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.\n\nInflation likely rose 2.8% on an annual basis in July, inching higher from the 2.7% annual rate notched in the prior month, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet. July data for the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Aug. 12.\n\n\"The stagflation theme in markets is intensifying,\" Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok wrote in a research note Thursday.\n\nWhile prices likely crept higher last month, they're still nowhere near the post-pandemic price spike that financially hobbled many households. Yet an increase would represent a reversal of a downward trend earlier this year, and push the inflation rate farther from the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.\n\nThe economy could face another hit from tariffs if some U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the import duties to the federal government, scale back hiring or expansion plans to cope with those higher costs, economists added. Last week's disappointing employment report suggested the U.S. job market is starting to wobble from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs, they noted.\n\n\"To offset internal costs, you may look at reducing your workforce and curbing wage growth to offset part of the cost of goods increase,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nU.S. GDP is also forecast to slow throughout 2025, with economists polled by FactSet pegging this year's growth at 1.5%, down from 2.4% in 2024.\n\nThe White House took issue with concerns raised by some economists about the potential for stagflation. \"Inflation continuing to remain cool and growth rebounding in Q2 both suggest stagflation is simply the latest buzzword for panican paranoia,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\n\"Panican\" is a term coined by Mr. Trump earlier this year to refer to the fears expressed by some critics about his tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. economy is facing a challenging scenario from the combination of a weaker job market and higher inflation, Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, a monetary policy research institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\n\"The U.S. economy appears to be hitting a mild form of stagflation,\" Amarnath said. \"I'd call it stagflation lite.\"\n\nThe dangers of higher inflation and a weaker job market were highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last month when he discussed the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. Powell pointed out that job creation has slowed, adding risks to the labor market, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual goal.\n\nThe Fed has a dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low. Achieving those goals requires different strategies, however. Because high interest rates make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, the Fed tends to hike rates to fight inflation.\n\nBut when unemployment spikes, the Fed typically cuts its benchmark rate to make borrowing cheaper, which can encourage businesses to hire and expand.\n\n\"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" Powell said at a July 30 press conference.\n\nHe added that the Fed is \"trying to do the right thing in what is a challenging situation because you're being pulled in two directions and you have to decide which of those it took to go in.\"\n\nWith the job market now showing signs of stress, the challenge is whether the Fed should cut rates, or hold off because inflation remains higher than the central bank's goal \u2014 and is projected to inch higher, Slok noted.\n\nThe manufacturing, retail, wholesale and construction industries, which are sensitive to the impact of tariffs, all notched fewer job gains than were initially reported, with the July jobs report's revisions. Manufacturing jobs declined for three consecutive months from May through July, the data shows.\n\n\"That's consistent with a level of uncertainty on the trade side depressing the willingness to hire,\" Amarnath said.\n\nAt the same time, \"goods prices have picked up speed,\" he added. \"Household supplies and furniture, apparel and used cars are all starting to see upward momentum, and I think tariffs are an obvious reason for that.\"",

      "text": "With new tariffs in effect, economists see profit dips and price hikes up ahead\nPresident Trump's sweeping tariffs, which went into effect on Thursday, are likely to have a negative effect on companies' bottom lines and cause consumer prices to rise, trade experts say.\nWith the new duties on imports from dozens of U.S. trade partners now in place, Mr. Trump's foreign trade policy is expected to lead to even more dramatic cost increases for American companies and consumers, according to economists.\n\"Even if they might not raise prices immediately, it's unlikely that most businesses are just going to be willing to eat the extra costs forever,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, an online lending marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch.\nThe impact of tariffs on consumer prices was initially muted, explained Shulz, as firms can be reluctant to be the first among their competitors to institute price hikes. While some companies waited to see where tariff rates settled before adjusting retail prices, others took steps to absorb added costs to avoid turning off customers. But companies can't employ such measures forever, according to experts.\n\"You don't want to be the first to raise prices, even if you have a perfectly legitimate reason for doing so,\" Schulz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So, I suspect once we see businesses start raising their prices more, that might embolden others to do so as well.\"\nThat could mean a tsunami of price hike announcements from corporations, some of which have already warned of tariff impacts, or instituted \"tariff surcharges\" to cover their added costs.\nTo date, Mr. Trump's tariffs on the U.S.'s trade partners have generated billions of dollars in revenue for the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. government collected about $30 billion in tariff revenue in July, according to the Treasury Department. That reflects a 242% jump in revenue collected from duties since July 2024.\nIn addition to paying down the national debt, which currently stands at more than $36 trillion, those billions in new tariff revenue may be used to issue rebate checks for Americans, Mr. Trump suggested last month.\nProfit dips\nTariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.\n\"There is very little evidence that foreign exporters to the U.S. are reducing their prices,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're not seeing broad-based evidence of price cuts by countries, and that's an indication that foreign exporters realize that it's U.S. importers, U.S. businesses and eventually consumers that are bearing the brunt of this tariff-induced inflation acceleration.\"\nCompanies from personal electronics companies to automakers have already experienced the damaging effects of Mr. Trump's foreign trade policies on profits.\nOn Thursday Toyota, the world's largest auto maker, reported a 37% drop in profit in the April-June quarter and said it cut its full-year earnings forecast largely because of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Other auto makers have also said they expect to see profit drops as a result of the new levies.\nGM has projected a tariff hit of up to $5 billion for 2025, and Ford has said tariffs will cost the company $3 billion in revenue for the year.\nLiquor companies are in the tariff crosshairs, too. Guinness maker Diageo said it expects tariffs to cost it $200 million a year.\nWalmart in May warned that higher tariffs would force it to increase prices on a wide range of items at its stores, from bananas to children's car seats.\nPrice hikes\nSome companies have said outright that in order to bear the added costs from the new tariffs they'll have to pass along some of the pain to consumers in the form of price hikes.\nFor example, popular consumer electronics marker Sonos, which makes speakers, said on its third-quarter earnings call Wednesday that it would raise prices on its audio devices as a result of higher reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Malaysia, where Sonos devices for the U.S. market are made.\nOverall, as a result of the levies, Americans are expected to pay an average of 18.3% more for imported products, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research center.\nEY-Parthenon's Daco told CBS MoneyWatch that the higher costs being paid by companies because of tariffs is already starting to trickle down to product prices.\nCurrently, the average tariff rate stands at around 18% \u2014 the highest it's been in decades, according to Daco. As a result, \"the increase in the tariffs will only exacerbate inflationary pressure that [is] starting to emerge,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\"You're going to see more durable goods, and nondurable goods products with higher price tags,\" he said. \"That will feed into higher consumer price inflation and lead to a more pronounced erosion of consumer spending as more households struggle in the face of these higher prices.\"\nMr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing. He has also tried to assure the public that foreign producers will pay for the import taxes and has told retailers and automakers to absorb the additional expenses.\n\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS News.\n\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been four months since Liberation Day and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent CEA analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining.\""

      "text": "The labor market just hit a wall. Here's what experts say it means for the economy and your job.\nFriday's disappointing July employment report delivered a reality check on the U.S. economy, with the data suggesting the job market is wobbling from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs.\nWhat was surprising about the Friday report was that employers not only hired fewer people than expected last month, but the government revised its jobs data sharply downward for the prior two months. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June, reflecting \"paltry\" employment growth during those months, according to a research note from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco.\nThe latest jobs data is shedding new light on the U.S. economy as businesses absorb a multitude of changes \u2014 from President Trump's trade deals and fresh tariffs to the new GOP tax law, which provides tax breaks to many Americans but also cuts spending on health care and social programs like food stamps. The jobs data backs up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's most recent \"beige book\" \u2014 a report that compiles comments from local businesses \u2014 that many companies are delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"\n\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant jobs report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.\nShe added, \"We know the economy has ups and downs, and we're in a pretty stagnant place right now.\"\nIn other words, while the labor market isn't seeing massive layoffs, companies also aren't expanding their hiring plans. That can make it difficult for unemployed workers to find new jobs, with the number of people searching for work for more than 27 weeks jumping 11% to 1.8 million last month compared with a year earlier, government data shows.\nPockets of strength\nTo be sure, there were pockets of strength in the jobs report, with health care and social assistance adding a combined 73,300 jobs last month, the BLS reported. But many major U.S. employment sectors saw little or no hiring, including leisure and hospitality, transportation and construction, while others \u2014 including manufacturing \u2014 saw job losses last month, the July data shows.\nPresident Trump on Friday claimed without evidence that the jobs report was manipulated for \"political purposes,\" and fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.\nHe also asserted that the downward revisions were \"a major mistake,\" although the BLS revises its data each month to reflect new information, and the numbers frequently move both up and down.\n\"The president's belief that the BLS commissioner personally 'produced' the jobs numbers is preposterous and shows a complete misunderstanding of how government statistical agencies operate,\" noted Heidi Shierholz, the president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute and a former chief economist at the Department of Labor, in a post about McEntarfer's firing.\nShe added, \"These data are the product of careful work by hundreds of expert economists, statisticians and civil servants following transparent, well-established methodologies.\"\nTariff uncertainty\nBusinesses have been expressing hesitation given the uncertain impact of the Trump's tariffs, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.\n\"I'm hearing that uncertainty has really been weighing on businesses,\" Hammack said of her discussions with business owners in her district, which spans Eastern Kentucky, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania and part of West Virginia. \"They've been having a tough time to decide when to invest, how much to invest. Many of them have scaled back plans for investment.\"\nFor instance, one franchise owner said that they planned to refurbish their existing locations, rather than open new locations, she added.\nMr. Trump has said tariffs would revive U.S. manufacturing because companies will reshore or open new factories domestically, rather than pay the import duties.\nSome Trump officials portrayed the jobs report as a temporary setback as the administration seeks to revive American jobs through its trade policies.\n\"Obviously there were elements of [the jobs report] that we didn't love, but the trade deals are now in place that cover \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 almost 60% of the global economy,\" Stephen Miran, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters Friday.\nWith the setting of new tariff rates on Thursday for dozens of nations, uncertainty has also been resolved, he added. \"There probably were a lot of firms that, you know, sort of sitting there in May and June saying, 'Hey, you know, this tariff stuff's about to be resolved, this bill you know hopefully becomes law within a month or two \u2014 maybe I'm just going to hold off on this investment program.'\"\nAlso on Friday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement describing a flourishing economy under President Trump. \"Inflation has cooled, wages have increased, unemployment is stable, and the private sector is growing. President Trump's America First agenda has ensured new jobs go to American citizens, instead of illegals or foreign-born workers. The tariffs are raking in billions of dollars to make our country wealthy again,\" the statement read in part.\nA decline in manufacturing jobs\nThe U.S. lost 11,000 manufacturing jobs in July, and the revisions for May and June also show that the sector shed workers during those months. That's notable given Mr. Trump's promise to revive manufacturing jobs, which has led to new agreements from the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Apple to build new plants in the U.S.\nBut the Trump administration's tariffs have added to the challenges facing the manufacturing sector, especially those producing durable goods such as appliances and automobiles, noted Indeed's Ullrich. For instance, tariffs on imported metals such as steel and aluminum are making it pricier for many manufacturers to create their products, putting pressure on their margins and profits.\nThe downturn in manufacturing jobs \"is hardly surprising,\" said Scott Paul, president of the trade group the Alliance for American Manufacturing, in an email. \"It's another 'treading water' number, which has been the case more often than not for the past few years. But it is concerning that we're now 173,000 jobs below the most recent peak in February 2023,\" when total nonfarm payroll employment rose to 155.4 million.\nIt's possible that manufacturing jobs could reverse the trend now that the Trump administration's tariffs and tax policies are settled, Paul added.\nProgress on the Trump administration's goal of reshoring American manufacturing jobs may take years, given the cost and time required to build new factories, Ullrich noted. \"There are certain products that, even with the tariffs, are still cheaper to make overseas,\" she added.\n\"This is not a healthy job market,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"The economy needs certainty soon on tariffs. The longer this tariff whiplash lasts, the more likely this weak hiring environment turns into layoffs.\""

      "text": "GDP surged in the second quarter after sliding earlier this year\nThe U.S. economy surged between April and June after shrinking in the first three months of the year, driven by a large shift in imports tied to President Trump's trade policies.\nBy the numbers\nThe country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's higher than the 2% pace forecast for the April-to-June period, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.\nThe number represents a turnaround from the first three months of 2025, when GDP fell 0.5%, the worst quarterly performance for the economy since early 2022. The new data also shows consumers increased spending since the last quarter, with growth of 1.4%, up from 0.5% from January to March. The number is still down significantly from 4% in the final quarter of 2024.\nWhen it comes to assessing the strength of the economy, a more revealing number tucked into the GDP report is what is known as \"final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which excludes government spending, inventories and net exports. That number rose at only a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022 and a sign that demand is weakening.\nWhat the numbers mean\nGDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.\n\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.\nThomas Ryan, North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" because the growth spurt in the second quarter was largely driven by a 30% decline in imports after U.S. tariffs took effect.\nGDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.\nIn calculating GDP, imports are seen as reducing growth because they reflect purchases from overseas, rather than goods and services produced in the U.S. By contrast, exports boost a country's GDP because they reflect domestic goods and services that were sold abroad.\nThe upshot: Through the first half of 2025, the economy grew at an average rate of 1.25%. That's markedly slower than the pace of growth in 2024, when GDP for the full year rose 2.8%, noted Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research.\nWhere the economy is headed\nAlthough the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy remains solid and shows no signs of crumbling.\n\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.\nYaros added that consumers are slowing \u2014 but not switching off \u2014 their spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds economic activity.\nStill, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco notes that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter.\nAnother indicator of the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is again expected to hold rates steady. The Labor Department is also scheduled to release its monthly jobs report on Friday, offering a snapshot of how the labor market is faring."

      "text": "Federal Reserve holds its benchmark rate steady at today's FOMC meeting\nThe Federal Reserve said Wednesday it's keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook.\nThe decision to hold rates steady marks a continuation of the Fed's \"wait-and-see\" strategy this year, as it monitors the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices. But Wednesday's policy statement also underscored that the growth remains steady despite concerns about slowing economic activity.\n\"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"\nTwo voting FOMC members, Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, voted in favor of lowering the central bank's short-term rate \u2014 a rare show of dissent at the Fed, where monetary policy is generally set by consensus. It is the first time since 1993 that two member of the Fed's Board of Governors have voted against the chair, according to Capital Economics.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has faced pressure in recent months from President Trump to lower rates, with the president arguing that inflation remains relatively tame.\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said most FOMC members voted in favor of maintaining the current rate because inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual target, while also describing the economy as remaining in good shape.\n\"The economy is not performing as though restrictive policy were holding it back inappropriately,\" he said.\nPowell added, \"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" referring to the Fed's dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low.\nBy the numbers\nThe central bank on Wednesday said it would maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank cut interest rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.\nWall Street had anticipated the Fed's decision, with economists pegging the probability the central bank would hold rates steady at 96%, according to financial data firm FactSet.\nWhy is the Fed holding rates steady?\nThe Fed's Powell has signaled the Fed remains cautious about lowering rates given the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which he has said could dent economic growth and reignite inflation.\nNancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks the dissents by Bowman and Waller represent a minority opinion on the FOMC, with most of the rate-setting panel's voting members preferring to hold rates steady amid amid concern about inflation.\nInflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, with the Consumer Price Index rising in June to an annualized rate of 2.7%. At the same time, the economy remains solid. The economy grew at a stronger-than-expected 3% rate between April and June, according to data released Wednesday, with economists saying the rebound in growth from earlier this year supports the Fed's argument for keeping rates steady.\n\"This [GDP] report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's stance,\" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email prior to the Fed's decision. The central bank will \"wait for more consistent signals before considering rate cuts.\"\nWhen could the Fed cut rates?\nEconomists currently predict a 63% likelihood the Fed will cut rates at its two-day meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to FactSet. The FOMC, the central bank's rate-setting panel, doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.\nAlthough the economy has proved resilient despite concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs, some economists expect growth to lag and inflation to accelerate over the next few months. Following the latest Fed statement, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs forecast that the Fed will ease its benchmark rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points by year-end, starting in September.\nAsked whether the Fed could cut rates at the September meeting, Powell demurred, saying that the decision will be based on economic data that is released between now and the central bank's next meeting on Sept. 16-17. In the lead-up to that decision, the Fed will assess two monthly job reports from the Department of Labor and two additional months' of CPI data.\nMr. Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff rate on imports from India ahead of his administration's Aug. 1 deadline to strike trade deals with dozens of other countries. American importers such as Walmart are on the hook for paying the tariffs, although many companies stocked up on goods earlier this year to try to avoid hiking prices for inflation-weary customers.\n\"We know from surveys that companies have every intention of putting [the tariff costs] through to consumers,\" Powell said. \"A reasonable base case is these are one-time price effects.\"\nHe added, \"We will make sure this doesn't move from being a one-time price increase to serious inflation.\"\nPowell's remarks emphasizing the solid U.S. economy, as well as the risks from tariffs, signaled to some economists that a September rate cut might not be in the cards.\n\" For [a September rate cut] to happen, the rest of the FOMC will need to become either less concerned about the inflation outlook or more concerned about the economic and labor market outlook,\" said Capital Economics deputy chief North American economist Stephen Brown in a report."

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has large reserves to intervene, and the peg is a cornerstone of Hong Kong\u2019s success as a global financial center.\nBut there are pressures on the Hong Kong dollar peg. After Liberation Day, the US dollar depreciated significantly. As a result, capital started flowing into Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong dollar appreciated so much that it reached the strong limit of the trading band relative to the US dollar.\nIn response, a few weeks after Liberation Day, the HKMA lowered Hong Kong interest rates to zero. As a result, there is now a significant gap between interest rates in the US and in Hong Kong, which is putting pressure on the peg because investors can now borrow in Hong Kong dollars and invest in US dollars, earning a significant return as long as the peg holds.\nThis has increased discussion among macro investors about the Fleming-Mundell policy trilemma, which says that a country cannot simultaneously have 1) a fixed exchange rate, 2) free capital movement and 3) an independent monetary policy.\nThe bottom line is that we expect the Hong Kong dollar peg to hold.

  "argos_summary": "Economists are warning that President Trump's new tariffs, which have raised the average tariff rate to 18%, could lead the U.S. economy towards stagflation, characterized by high inflation and low growth. While inflation remains below post-pandemic levels, the tariffs are expected to increase consumer prices as businesses pass on costs, potentially impacting hiring and economic growth. The White House disputes these concerns, citing recent economic growth and low inflation, but experts caution that the combination of rising prices and a weakening job market poses significant risks.",
