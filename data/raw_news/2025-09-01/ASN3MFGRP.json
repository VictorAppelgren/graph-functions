  "title": "How AI will shape 4 investment banking careers, from ECM to trading",
  "description": "A report from the firm ThoughtLinks shows how careers in M&A, trading, equity, and debt will be transformed by AI over the coming five years.",
  "content": "Everyone says artificial intelligence will change the way we work. But on Wall Street, where investment banking jobs range from high-touch dealmaking to split-second trading, what will that actually look like? And who's most at risk?Each role in financial services will be impacted differently as AI spreads through the industry, a process that's well underway. JPMorgan and Citi have rolled out in-depth AI strategies; Goldman Sachs has made its AI chatbot sidekick available firmwide.Business Insider spoke to Sumeet Chabria, a former Bank of America executive turned founder of consultancy ThoughtLinks, whose firm recently produced a report forecasting precisely which tasks in the investment banking world will be overtaken by AI, and what humans will be doing.He offered detailed case studies covering four specific areas: M&A, sales and trading, equity underwriting, and debt underwriting \u2014 for each one, breaking down the roles AI will likely to overtake, and where humans will remain indispensable.Chabria's research predicts that AI could transform as much as 33% of IB workflows by 2030, meaning it will handle everything from data analysis and document drafting to simulating market scenarios. Here's a look at how the dynamic between people and the machines will play out for four specific Wall Street career tracks by 2030.M&A bankers will review potential risks, provide important context, and take the lead on final due diligence \u2014 especially in complex areas like tax, reputation, and integration planning, where human judgment is essential. They'll continue shaping deal strategy, advising clients, and leading negotiations.Lead ECM bankers will still oversee bookbuilding in real time, step in to adjust investor allocations when needed, and handle negotiations with key investors. They will also remain in charge of taking deals live, how a company's story is told, and getting sign-off from company leadership. Even with advanced models, understanding investor mood and managing tricky company situations will require human judgment and experience.DCM teams will keep evaluating the best time to issue debt based on the company's goals and their relationships with investors. While AI may draft documents, bankers \u2014 working together with legal counsel \u2014 must ensure they meet legal standards, align with rating agencies, and comply with regulations. Their judgment will be crucial in shaping language and guiding the market narrative.Traders will use AI recommendations to make trades on an even greater scale than they are doing now, intervening more heavily in disorderly conditions. They'll continue to manage inventory, client objectives, and risk appetite. Human oversight will be crucial in calibrating algorithmic boundaries, ensuring compliance, and preserving client trust in high-stakes environments.How is AI really showing up in your day-to-day? Is it living up to the hype? Take our quick, anonymous survey and tell us how \u2014 or if \u2014 AI is changing your job.",
