  "content": "KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip \u2014 The dead body of 2 1/2-year-old Ro\u2019a Mashi lay on the table in Gaza\u2019s Nasser Hospital, her arms and rib cage skeletal, her eyes sunken in her skull. Doctors say she had no preexisting conditions and wasted away over months as her family struggled to find food and treatment.\n\nHer family showed The Associated Press a photo of Ro\u2019a\u2019s body at the hospital, and it was confirmed by the doctor who received her remains. Several days after she died, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday told local media, \u201cThere is no hunger. There was no hunger. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.\u201d\n\nIn the face of international outcry, Netanyahu has pushed back, saying reports of starvation are \u201clies\u201d promoted by Hamas.\n\nHowever, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric this week warned that starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at the highest levels since the war began.\n\nThe U.N. says nearly 12,000 children under 5 were found to have acute malnutrition in July - including more than 2,500 with severe malnutrition, the most dangerous level. The World Health Organization says the numbers are likely an undercount.\n\nThe past two weeks, Israel has allowed around triple the amount of food into Gaza than had been entering since late May. That followed 2 1/2 months when Israel barred all food, medicine and other supplies, saying it was to pressure Hamas to release hostages taken during its 2023 attack that launched the war. The new influx has brought more food within reach for some of the population and lowered some prices in marketplaces, though it remains far more expensive than prewar levels and unaffordable for many.\n\nWhile better food access might help much of Gaza\u2019s population, \u201cit won\u2019t help the children who are severely malnourished,\u201d said Alex DeWaal, executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, who has worked on famine and humanitarian issues for more than 40 years.\n\nWhen a person is severely malnourished, vital micronutrients are depleted and bodily functions deteriorate. Simply feeding the person can cause harm, known as \u201crefeeding syndrome,\u201d potentially leading to seizures, coma or death. Instead, micronutrients must first be replenished with supplements and therapeutic milk in a hospital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about thousands of kids who need to be in hospital if they\u2019re going to have a chance of survival,\u201d DeWaal said. \u201cIf this approach of increasing the food supply had been undertaken two months ago, probably many of those kids would not have gotten into this situation.\u201d\n\nAny improvement is also threatened by a planned new Israeli offensive that Netanyahu says will capture Gaza City and the tent camps where most of the territory\u2019s population is located. That will prompt a huge new wave of displacement and disrupt food delivery, U.N. and aid officials warn.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry says 42 children died of malnutrition-related causes since July 1, along with 129 adults. It says 106 children have died of malnutrition during the entire war. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, is staffed by medical professionals and its figures on casualties are seen by the U.N. and other experts as the most reliable.\n\nThe Israeli military Tuesday pointed to the fact that some children who died had preexisting conditions, arguing their deaths were \u201cunrelated to their nutritional status.\u201d It said a review by its experts had concluded there are \u201cno signs of a widespread malnutrition phenomenon\u201d in Gaza.\n\nAt his press briefing Sunday, Netanyahu spoke in front of a screen reading \u201cFake Starving Children\u201d over photos of skeletal children with preexisting conditions. He accused Hamas of starving the remaining Israeli hostages and repeated claims the militant group is diverting large amounts of aid, a claim the U.N. denies.\n\nDoctors in Gaza acknowledge that some of those dying or starving have chronic conditions, including cerebral palsy, rickets or genetic disorders, some of which make children more vulnerable to malnutrition. However, those conditions are manageable when food and proper medical treatments are available, they say.\n\n\u201cThe worsening shortages of food led to these cases\u2019 swift deterioration,\u201d said Dr. Yasser Abu Ghali, head of Nasser\u2019s pediatrics unit. \u201cMalnutrition was the main factor in their deaths.\u201d\n\nOf 13 emaciated children whose cases the AP has seen since late July, five had no preexisting conditions - including three who died - according to doctors.\n\nAbu Ghali spoke next to the body of Jamal al-Najjar, a 5-year-old who died Tuesday of malnutrition and was born with rickets, which hinders the ability to metabolize vitamins, weakening bones.\n\nIn the past months, the boy\u2019s weight fell from 16 kilograms to 7 (35 pounds to 15), said his father, Fadi al-Najjar, whose lean face showed his own hunger.\n\nAsked about Netanyahu\u2019s claim there was no hunger in Gaza, he pointed at Jamal\u2019s protruding rib cage. \u201cOf course there\u2019s famine,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes a 5-year-old child\u2019s chest normally come to look like this?\u201d\n\nDr. Ahmed al-Farra, Nasser\u2019s general director of pediatrics, said the facility receives 10-20 children with severe malnutrition a day, and the numbers are rising.\n\nOn Sunday, a severely malnourished 2-year-old, Shamm Qudeih, cried in pain in her hospital bed. Her arms, legs and ribs were skeletal, her belly inflated.\n\n\u201cShe has lost all fat and muscle,\u201d al-Farra said. She weighed 4 kilograms (9 pounds), a third of a 2-year-old\u2019s normal weight.\n\nDoctors suspect Shamm suffers from a rare genetic condition called glycogen storage disease, which changes how the body uses and stores glycogen, a form of sugar, and can impact muscle and bone development. But they can\u2019t test for it in Gaza, al-Farra said.\n\nNormally, the condition can be managed through a high-carbohydrate diet.\n\nHer family applied a year ago for medical evacuation, joining a list of thousands the WHO says need urgent treatment abroad. For months, Israel slowed evacuations to a near standstill or halted them for long stretches. But it appears to be stepping up permissions, with more than 60 allowed to leave in the first week of August, according to the U.N.\n\nPermission for Shamm to leave Gaza finally came this week, and on Wednesday, she was heading to a hospital in Italy.\n\nRo\u2019a was one of four dead children who suffered from malnutrition brought to Nasser over the course of just over two weeks, doctors say.\n\nHer mother, Fatma Mashi, said she first noticed Ro\u2019a losing weight last year, but she thought it was because she was teething. When she took Ro\u2019a to Nasser Hospital in October, the child was severely malnourished, according to al-Farra, who said Ro\u2019a had no preexisting conditions.\n\nAt the time, in the last months of 2024, Israel had reduced aid entry to some of the lowest levels of the war.\n\nThe family was also displaced multiple times by Israeli military operations. Each move interrupted Ro\u2019a\u2019s treatment as it took time to find a clinic to get nutritional supplements, Mashi said. The family was reduced to one meal a day - often boiled macaroni - but \u201cwhatever she ate, it didn\u2019t change anything in her,\u201d Mashi said.\n\nTwo weeks ago, they moved into the tent camps of Muwasi on Gaza\u2019s southern coast. Ro\u2019a\u2019s decline accelerated.\n\n\u201cI could tell it was only a matter of two or three more days,\u201d Mashi said in the family\u2019s tent Friday, the day after she had died.\n\nMashi and her husband Amin both looked gaunt, their cheeks and eyes hollow. Their five surviving children \u2013 including a baby born this year \u2014 are thin, but not nearly as emaciated as Ro\u2019a.\n\nDeWaal said it\u2019s not unusual in famines for one family member to be far worse than others. \u201cMost often it will be a kid who is 18 months or 2 years\u201d who is most vulnerable, he said, while older siblings are \u201cmore robust.\u201d\n\nBut any number of things can set one child into a spiral of malnutrition, such as an infection or troubles after weaning.\n\n\u201cA very small thing can push them over.\u201d\n\nKeath reported from Cairo.
