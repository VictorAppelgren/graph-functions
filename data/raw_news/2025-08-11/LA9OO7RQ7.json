He said the company, now a subsidiary of Japan-based Nippon Steel Corp., is working with authorities.\n\nAllegheny Health Network said it treated seven patients from the plant and discharged five within a few hours. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said it is treating three patients at UPMC Mercy, the region\u2019s only level one trauma and burn center.\n\nIn a statement, the United Steelworkers, which represents many of the Clairton plant\u2019s workers, said it had representatives on the ground at the plant and would work to ensure there is a thorough investigation.\n\nDavid Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, an environmental group that has sued U.S. Steel over pollution, said there needed to be \u201ca full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first explosion at the plant. A maintenance worker was killed in a blast in September 2009. In July 2010, another explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors. According to online OSHA records of workplace fatalities, the last death at the plant was in 2014, when a worker was burned and died after falling into a trench.\n\nAfter the 2010 explosion, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined U.S. Steel and a subcontractor $175,000 for safety violations. U.S. Steel appealed its citations and fines, which were later reduced under a settlement agreement.\n\nIn February, a problem with a battery at the plant led to a \u201cbuildup of combustible material\u201d that ignited, causing an audible \u201cboom,\u201d officials said. Two workers received first aid treatment but were not seriously injured.",
