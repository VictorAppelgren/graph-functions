      "summary": "Indonesian protests over lawmakers’ housing allowance have escalated into widespread violence, with arson attacks on provincial and regional parliament buildings in Makassar, West Java, and Surabaya, resulting in at least three deaths and multiple injuries. The unrest, sparked by a $3,075 monthly allowance deemed excessive amid high living costs, intensified after the death of a ride‑hailing driver during a Jakarta rally, prompting nationwide demonstrations and police crackdowns. Authorities have detained hundreds, and foreign embassies have urged citizens to avoid protest zones. The turmoil underscores growing public frustration with perceived government excesses and the broader social‑economic tensions in Indonesia.",
