      "summary": "A U.S. judge ordered Google to curb its monopoly power by restricting contracts that lock its search engine as the default on devices, while allowing the multi‑billion‑dollar default deals to continue. The ruling also requires Google to share some of its search data with rivals but rejects a divestiture of Chrome. Investors viewed the decision as a mild blow, with Alphabet’s stock rising about 3% after the ruling. The judge’s order balances antitrust concerns with the potential harm of breaking up Google’s ecosystem, leaving further remedies to be decided later.",
