      "text": "A day after launching a new line of Roomba vacuum cleaners, iRobot Corp. has warned investors that it could shut down in the next 12 months unless it can refinance its debt or find a buyer. According to its latest financial filings, iRobot is heavily in debt.

      "text": "After a tumultuous 2024, in which iRobot lost its founder and CEO, Colin Angle, Amazon abandoned its acquisition plans, and the company laid off a large portion of its staff, iRobot is back with a major shake-up of its robotic vacuum line.\niRobot launches eight new Roombas and finally adds lidar mapping\nIf you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em.\nIf you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em.\nThis week, the company that invented the robot vacuum over 20 years ago announced eight new models that are definitely not the Roombas you\u2019re used to. Not only do they look totally different, but they also work differently, thanks to a new-to-Roomba feature: lidar navigation and mapping.\niRobot has started publishing suction power specs for its robots\nThe new lineup starts at $299 and goes up to $999. It features the entry-level 105 series of vacuums and vacuum mops with the option of an auto-empty dock, the 205 series with a new onboard dust compactor, and the higher-end 405 and 505 models that bring dual spinning mopping pads to the iRobot family for the first time. The new bots come in black and white and will be available to preorder on March 18th at iRobot.com in the US and select European markets.\nAccording to the company, this is the largest product launch in iRobot history. But that\u2019s not the biggest surprise. iRobot finally adding lidar navigation and room mapping \u2014 a technology used by most competitors \u2014 is a huge change that should bring faster mapping and more features to Roombas. The company is also launching a new iRobot app that adds a real-time cleaning view aided by lidar and it has started publishing suction power specs for its robots.\nAll the new models feature 7,000Pa and four suction levels, according to iRobot\u2019s product management lead, Warren Fernandez. While he points out it\u2019s not all about suction power, this is significantly lower than the competition. Roborock\u2019s newest model, the Saros 10, has 22,000Pa (but costs $1,600).\nFacing increasing competition from Chinese manufacturers, iRobot has gone back to the drawing board with this new line. Featuring a completely new industrial design, the Roombas have been redesigned from the ground up to accommodate the shift from camera-based vSLAM navigation to lidar.\nIn an interview with The Verge, Fernandez said that iRobot made the change now after evaluating the technology for some time because they believe lidar is finally mature enough and affordable enough to fit into their product roadmap.\nThe main benefit of lidar is smarter mapping for the lower-priced Roombas, including room-specific cleaning and the ability to create clean zones and keep-out zones in the app. For the higher-end models, it should mean faster mapping and more agile navigation.\nAlso new is an ultrasonic carpet detection sensor on all Roombas, so the robots can intelligently avoid carpets when mopping. The mopping models now all have three levels of water flow and iRobot\u2019s unique SmartScrub option. Previously, most of these features were reserved for higher-end Roombas, which started at $500.\nMost models now have a lidar tower on top, and the auto-empty docks have a whole new look. Overall, the new Roombas look a lot more like models from iRobot\u2019s major competitors: Roborock, Dreame, and Ecovacs.\nThe fanciest model in the new line is the $999 (\u20ac799) Roomba Plus 505 Combo Robot Plus AutoWash Dock (yes, the naming has gotten worse). This is the first Roomba with dual spinning mop pads for scrubbing hard floors. It can also extend its right mop outward to clean along edges and lift its mops 10mm to avoid low-pile carpets. Roborock and Dreame have had variations on these features for a while.\nThe 505 comes with a new multifunction dock that washes and dries the mop pads, refills the mop tank, and empties the bin. It also adds heated drying, something the Combo 10 Max, iRobot\u2019s top-of-the-line robot vacuum / mop that launched last summer, doesn\u2019t have. Like the 10 Max, the 505 has AI-powered obstacle detection, thanks to an onboard camera, so it should recognize and avoid things like cords, socks, and pet waste.\nFernandez says the 10 Max remains the current flagship model, as it has better cleaning power than the 505, but he declined to give suction specs for it. It uses a different mop \u2014 a retractable system that puts the mop on top of the bot to avoid carpets. According to Fernandez, the 505 is the only Roomba among the new models that will support the Matter smart home standard, which the 10 Max also does. All the new models will support existing integrations with Amazon Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri, and Google Home.\nThe Roomba Plus 405 Combo Robot Plus AutoWash Dock is a step down in price to $799 (\u20ac699). It keeps all the same basic functionality \u2014 a combo vacuum and mop with spinning mopping pads and a multifunctional dock \u2014 but it differs from the 505 in a few ways. It can\u2019t extend its mops, doesn\u2019t have AI-powered obstacle detection (as there\u2019s no camera), and lacks heated mop drying. It also has iRobot\u2019s standard ClearView Lidar navigation, whereas the 505 has a Pro version, which Fernandez says is more accurate and can see smaller objects.\nThe budget lineup is also getting a big bump up. The new Roomba 105 and 205 series have the same lidar-based mapping, 7,000Pa suction, virtual keep-out zones, automatic carpet detection and avoidance, and object sensing and avoidance capabilities as the 405, all features unavailable on the entry-level Roomba i5 and Combo Essential line.\nBoth new models come in a vacuum-only or a combo option that adds a removable flat microfiber mopping pad. The 105 works with an auto-empty dock, but the 205 uses the new dust compactor technology. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a miniaturized version of a trash compactor,\u201d says Fernandez. He says it can last two months before emptying, compared to 75 days on the auto-empty dock. You don\u2019t need to find space for an auto-empty dock, which means you can stick your robot under a couch or bed, and he added that there isn\u2019t a loud emptying noise or a need to buy bin bags.\nBoth series are priced the same: $449 for the 105 Vac Robot Plus AutoEmpty Dock; $469 (\u20ac449) for the 105 Combo Robot Plus AutoEmpty Dock; $449 for the 205 DustCompactor Vac Robot; and $469 (\u20ac449) for the 205 DustCompactor Combo Robot. (This is more expensive than Roomba\u2019s Combo Essential line with auto-empty dock, but those don\u2019t have lidar.) If you\u2019re fine with emptying a bin once a week or so, you can go for the 105 Vac Robot for $299 or the 105 Combo Robot for $319 (\u20ac299).\nThere are some innovations here; the dust compactor will appeal to those who don\u2019t like the extra clutter of those big auto-empty docks. I\u2019ve seen something similar on the Narwal Freo X Ultra and found it to be very good. But overall, this lineup represents iRobot capitulating to the competition.\nWhat people really want is spinning mop pads, lidar towers, and suction specs, so that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting\nFor years, under founder and CEO Colin Angle, the company stood firm in its belief that its superior cleaning ability and smarter robots were just better. It appears that the new CEO, Gary Cohen, took a look at the competitive landscape and decided that what people really want is spinning mop pads, lidar towers, and suction specs, so that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting. \u201cLast year, we reinvented our iRobot Research and Development Labs, and these robots are the result of our world-class engineers\u2019 and designers\u2019 brilliance,\u201d he said in a press release.\nThis \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em\u201d approach is clearly designed to save the struggling company. The pricing is competitive, and combined with the Roomba name, it\u2019s a strategy that could work well, assuming the products are as good and as reliable as Roombas have traditionally been.\nI\u2019m looking forward to testing the new robots to see how they stack up to the current Roombas, which have long been some of my favorite robot vacuums. But for today, I\u2019m slightly sad to see decades of innovation and enterprise at iRobot get trampled in what looks to be a boring race to the middle.\nMost Popular\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- GitHub is no longer independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs"

      "text": "Amazon backing out of its deal to buy iRobot due to regulatory issues may feel like a win for privacy advocates, but it could be a death knell for the Roomba robot vacuum as we know it.\nAmazon left Roomba with a huge mess to clean up\nBy abandoning its deal to buy iRobot, Amazon has left the robot vacuum maker stuck under the couch.\nAmazon left Roomba with a huge mess to clean up\nBy abandoning its deal to buy iRobot, Amazon has left the robot vacuum maker stuck under the couch.\nOn the face of it, the objection from the European Commission that the deal was anti-competitive is cruelly ironic for iRobot, a foundering market leader struggling against a giant wave of competition. It was relying on Amazon to bring it an injection of cash along with the resources it needed to stay afloat in today\u2019s insanely competitive robot vacuum market. But the deal is dead, and iRobot\u2019s competition is still very much there.\niRobot\u2019s dominant market share has been steadily eroding since 2014. According to data from Statista, it dropped from 64 percent in 2016 to 46 percent in 2020. As someone who has been reviewing robot vacuums for over five years, it\u2019s easy to see why.\nIn the last decade, Chinese companies like Ecovacs (Deebot / Yeedi), Anker (Eufy), Roborock (backed by Xiaomi), and Dreame Technology have burst onto the global market with cheaper, flashier options.\nSamsung and US-based SharkNinja are also taking bites out of the pie, and that\u2019s not to mention the dozens of no-name brands with bots available on Amazon for under $200 \u2014 a fraction of the price of flagships from Roborock ($1,600) and Roomba ($1,400).\nThe market was tough enough to take down one US-based robovac company last year, Neato Robotics. Now, iRobot is the one with problems. Reporting a net loss for 2022, it potentially needed a deal like Amazon\u2019s to survive.\nIf anyone was going to bring us a Rosey the Robot, it was iRobot\nA sale could have helped iRobot \u201cbetter compete in the global marketplace, particularly against companies, and from countries, that aren\u2019t subject to the same regulatory requirements in fast-moving technology segments like robotics,\u201d said Amazon SVP David Zapolsky when Amazon announced it was abandoning the deal.\nNow iRobot has lost its CEO and founder Colin Angle, is laying off staff, and facing an existential crisis, which is a huge shame because it\u2019s still our best bet for truly smart and innovative robovacs. Led by Angle, iRobot has been a major innovator in home robotics over the last three decades. The sum total of its advancements exceeds those of competitors like Roborock and Ecovacs. If anyone was going to bring us a Rosey the Robot, it was iRobot.\niRobot invented the first successful robot vacuum over 20 years ago, but if your last experience with a Roomba was pre-2013, things have changed. Today, all these floor cleaning droids are much, much better \u2014 in large part due to iRobot\u2019s innovations that have been adopted by the rest of the market.\nIt was the first to implement a viable auto-empty dock that sucks the dirt out of the robot\u2019s bin for you. (Others tried, but versions of iRobot\u2019s method are now standard). It was one of the first to bring effective room mapping to move bots on from their bump-and-roll randomness, and it has led the way in developing reliable AI algorithms for avoiding household objects like socks, phone cables, and pet waste. And, based on my extensive experience testing these bots, it\u2019s still the best at cleaning your floors. Its unique dual rubber roller brush system, which some have copied but none have surpassed, gets the job done.\nWhat also sets iRobot apart is its approach to software. On top of a robust and easy-to-use app, the company has built a robot OS with the goal of elevating floor-cleaning robots from basic remote control vacuuming to something smarter. \u201cThe barrier to the next level of AI in robotics isn\u2019t better AI. It\u2019s context,\u201d Angle told me in 2022, just prior to announcing the Amazon deal. iRobot was working on using its robots to better understand how we live in our homes to both improve how they clean and potentially expand further into the smart home. This, as I\u2019ve said before, is a big part of why Amazon wanted the company.\nPotentially, it was these efforts at making the robot floor cleaner smarter, plowing money into R&D around intelligence rather than churning out more mass-market products like its competitors, that put iRobot in its current precarious position.\nIts competitors are racing ahead, regularly launching new models at multiple price points with new, sometimes bizarre-seeming features (a vacuum with an arm, a robot that can cut hair, and another with mops that can do the splits).\nWhile iRobot has not been resting on its laurels, its decision not to pivot to lidar from vSLAM (visual simultaneous localization and mapping) when the technology became more affordable was a questionable one. As was its slow adoption of the popular combination mopping and vacuuming model. The company stuck for too long to its ethos that the tasks were better separate (it has a line of mopping-only robots) before only halfheartedly addressing the problem with the Combo j7 in 2022 and, more recently, launching more lower-cost bots.\nIn the meantime, Roborock, Ecovacs, and Dreame Technology have been furiously innovating on the all-in-one solution: a robot vacuum that can mop, vacuum, empty its bin, refill its mop, drain its dirty water, clean and blow dry its mop pads, and even hook into your plumbing so you barely need to lift a finger. A year later, iRobot responded with the Combo j9 Plus, which has an auto-fill dock for the mop but lacks many of the features its competitors tout.\nThe pandemic bump the company experienced when we were all frantically cleaning our homes turned into a catastrophic tumble\nWhile these multifunction robovacs may be more of a fad than a trend (time will tell, but few do both well and those docks are more work than they appear), its tardiness here puts iRobot on the back foot. Now, hurting for cash and with its founder Angle out, the money men are coming in.\nThe pandemic bump the company experienced when we were all frantically cleaning our homes turned into a catastrophic tumble as revenue dropped. The 2022 net loss has been compounded, and iRobot is estimating an operating loss of up to $285 million in 2023. Last year, it had to borrow $200 million until the Amazon deal closed, and with just a $94 million apology from Amazon for walking away from the deal, it\u2019s got to find the rest of that money elsewhere or risk being sold off for parts.\nThe plan includes cutting a third of its staff, shutting down offices, and reducing research and development by $20 million year over year through offshoring non-core engineering functions. It\u2019s also abandoning its line of air purifiers (it purchased Aeris in 2021) and its Terra robot lawnmower (which never launched in the US), which will once again put the competition ahead of it. Ecovacs and Dreame are both shipping robot lawnmowers to the US for the first time this year, and Ecovacs has a robot air purifier it says is coming to the US soon.\nWithout substantive R&D, innovative new products, and building on its (comparatively) excellent software, Roomba could quickly become an also-ran as Chinese companies move in and hoover up more market share. These companies make good robot vacuums and are innovating rapidly, but they come with their own issues, including a lack of user repairability (which iRobot excels at) and some privacy concerns.\nAngle said this week that he believes \u201ciRobot has an exciting future ahead of it.\u201d With basic robot vacuums fast becoming a commodity product, the next big thing in home robotics is a leap I\u2019m genuinely excited about. While iRobot was high on my list of companies to deliver that, I wish I could be as optimistic about its future.\nMost Popular\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes\n- GitHub is no longer independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- Ditching my phone for an LTE smartwatch was a humbling experience\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs"
