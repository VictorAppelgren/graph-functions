      "feedback": "The analysis draft presents a solid overview of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it could benefit from enhanced clarity and depth in several areas. First, strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking how Trump's tariffs are influencing inflation and labor market dynamics, and clarify the implications of these relationships for Fed policy. Second, ensure alignment with the multi-year horizon by discussing potential long-term structural changes in the economy, such as shifts in consumer behavior or corporate investment patterns due to tariffs. Third, incorporate specific quantitative data to support claims, such as the exact percentage changes in inflation or job growth, and avoid vague statements like \"mixed signals\" without elaboration. Fourth, increase citation density by referencing more sources to substantiate key points, particularly regarding historical precedents of economic downturns. Lastly, conclude with a more definitive base case scenario, including specific catalysts or triggers that could validate or invalidate this outlook, and articulate the confidence level more clearly.",
