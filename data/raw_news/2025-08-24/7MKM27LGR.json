  "content": "Aug 25 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.\n\nAsian markets have so far managed a cautious cheer for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's seemingly dovish turn last week, with the Nikkei up and Chinese stocks extending their recent rousing run.\n\nChinese blue chips have climbed almost 10% so far this month to reach ground not trod since mid-2022, even as domestic demand remains tepid and companies have no pricing power to speak of.\n\nThat's the power of momentum. Why are shares going up? Because people are buying them. Why are they buying? Because they're going up.\n\nEuropean and U.S. stock futures are in a more sober mood after Friday's euphoria, perhaps reflecting the realisation that things must be getting worse for the U.S. economy for the Fed to consider cutting rates even as inflation heads for 3% and above.\n\nThe \"why\" matters. It's one thing to ease policy because inflation is cooling, but another thing entirely to have to ease to support the economy and head off an unwelcome rise in unemployment. Powell argued the inflationary impact of tariffs was likely to be a one-off rise in the price level, but that risks sounding like the \"transitory\" tag given to the initial spike in prices post-COVID.\n\nThe Fed's favoured core PCE price index due on Friday is already expected to tick up to a 19-month high of 2.9%, and a 3.0% reading would cause some sticker shock for the long end of the Treasury curve. The Street also has to digest $183 billion in new supply this week, an outsized meal even for a market this big.\n\nTalking of outsized, Nvidia reports on Wednesday and needs to knock the lights out to justify its $4 trillion market cap - which is fast approaching the worth of the entire Nikkei index.\n\nExpectations are for a mere 48% rise in earnings per share on revenue of almost $46 billion, so the bar is high. Which could be why options imply the chance of a 6% move in the share price in either direction depending on the results.\n\nIt was notable last week that tech stumbled a little as some began to wonder how much of hundreds of billions of dollars going into AI investment will ever make a return, or is this another dot-com bubble.\n\nThere will be much interest in how exactly the proposed deal with President Trump works, where Nvidia pays the U.S. government 15% of its earnings on some chips sold to China in return for export permits. Details are scarce and analysts are not even sure that it's constitutional, but that's State Capitalism with American Characteristics for you.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Monday:\n\n- Ifo business survey for August. U.S. July new home sales, Chicago and Dallas Fed manufacturing surveys\n\n- Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams and Fed Bank of Dallas President Lorie Logan speak",

      "text": "The Trust Principles\nThomson Reuters is dedicated to upholding the Trust Principles and to preserving its independence, integrity, and freedom from bias in the gathering and dissemination of information and news.\nTrust Principles \u2013 the history\nThe Trust Principles were created in 1941, in the midst of World War II, in agreement with The Newspaper Proprietors Association Limited and The Press Association Limited (being the Reuters shareholders at that time). The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations. The charter documents of Thomson Reuters Corporation include provisions to safeguard the Trust Principles as they apply to the Thomson Reuters business and require Thomson Reuters Directors, in the performance of their duties, to have due regard to the Trust Principles, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their other duties as Directors.\nThe Trust Principles are:\n- That Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction;\n- That the integrity, independence, and freedom from bias of Thomson Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved;\n- That Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media subscribers and to businesses, governments, institutions, individuals, and others with whom Reuters has or may have contracts;\n- That Thomson Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in addition to those of the media; and\n- That no effort shall be spared to expand, develop, and adapt the news and other services and products of Thomson Reuters so as to maintain its leading position in the international news and information business\nThomson Reuters Founders Share Company was established in 1984 when Reuters became a public company. The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management. Through Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company's Chairman, regular contact is maintained with our company. The relationship is one of trust and confidence.\nIndependence of Thomson Reuters\nCustomers across the world depend on us to provide them with reliable and objective news and information.\nThis means that we have a special need to safeguard our independence and integrity and avoid any bias which may stem from control by specific individuals or interests.\nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles were adopted in 1941 and include the preservation of integrity, reliability of news, development of the news business, and related principles.\nToday, the Trust Principles are fundamental to our entire business.\nMore information\nContact us\nBrian Moss\nFor inquiries pertaining to Reuters reporting standards and the Trust Principles please email: brian.moss@thomsonreuters.com."

European and U.S. futures remain subdued after Friday\u2019s euphoria, reflecting concerns that the Fed may need to cut rates only if the economy deteriorates, even as inflation heads toward 3%+. Nvidia faces high expectations for earnings, and investors are watching how a proposed deal with President Trump might affect its export permits and earnings. Upcoming data releases\u2014including the Ifo business survey, U.S. home sales, and Fed officials\u2019 speeches\u2014could further influence market sentiment.
