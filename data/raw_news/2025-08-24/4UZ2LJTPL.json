  "description": "Archaeologists recently uncovered a 1,500-year-old baptistery in Vence, France, revealing insights into early Christian rituals and religious practices from the fifth century.",
  "content": "An ancient baptistery was recently unearthed in France \u2013 and archaeologists say the discovery sheds light on Christian rituals from over 1,500 years ago.\n\nThe baptistery, dating back to the fifth and sixth centuries A.D., was found next to an ancient cathedral in Vence, a commune less than 10 miles west of Nice. While the cathedral was discovered earlier this year, the baptistery was only uncovered this summer.\n\nFabien Blanc Garidel, the supervising archaeologist on the project, confirmed the discovery to Fox News Digital.\n\nITALIAN ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNVEIL RARE 2,600-YEAR-OLD TOMB UNTOUCHED BY LOOTERS: 'DOORWAY TO OUR ANCESTORS'\n\nIn an email translated from French to English, the historian described the baptistery as a \"circular building, likely surrounded by a colonnade and covered.\"\n\nBlanc Garidel noted that \"at the center, the baptismal font is octagonal on the outside and cross-shaped on the inside. It is bordered by a decorative coating made of b\u00e9ton de tuileau, a Roman concrete using crushed tile.\"\n\nBlanc Garidel estimated the baptistery to be 1,500 to 1,600 years old.\n\nIt is located in front of the forecourt of the cathedral, which was a common layout at the time.\n\nThe foundation of the baptistery, Blanc Garidel said, is the only relic that remains \u2013 but the font, or the baptism receptacle, is \"in very good condition.\"\n\nHe said the recent excavation helps show how early the diocese of Vence was established.\n\n\"This discovery confirms the antiquity of the bishopric of Vence and enhances our knowledge of early Christian religious practices in the Alpes-Maritimes and Provence,\" he said.\n\n\"However, much work and analysis remain to be done in the coming months to provide further details.\"\n\nSeveral burials were uncovered in the cathedral's nave, he also said.\n\nThe tombs were built using pitched Roman roof tiles, a method typical of the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"All of these burials are likely those of religious figures (bishops or canons) from the Carolingian period,\" he said.\n\n\"Radiocarbon dating will help clarify the timeline.\"\n\nOverall, the archaeologist said, the excavation sheds light on over six centuries of construction \u2013 and even revealed a Roman dwelling under the cathedral.\n\n\"One of the most significant aspects of this discovery is that the preserved archaeological structures offer insight into the history of this monument over six centuries (5th\u201311th centuries),\" he said.\n\n\"The cathedral was demolished in the 11th century to build a new one right next to it.\"\n\n\"After it was abandoned, two bell molds were installed in the nave of the old cathedral \u2013 likely to cast bells for the new one.\"\n\nThe discovery is among several recent finds offering new insight into early Christianity in Europe.\n\nLast year, historians unveiled a silver inscription representing the earliest-known north of the Alps.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMore recently, an ancient Christian warning was unearthed at the site of a fifth-century church in Turkey this summer.",

      "text": "The earliest known evidence of Christianity north of Italy was recently unveiled by archaeologists, who call the discovery one of the \"most important testimonies of early Christianity.\"\nThe artifact, publicized by the Frankfurt Archaeological Museum last week, is called the Frankfurt silver inscription. Discovered in 2018, the inscription has been analyzed and studied for years before finally being released to the public this month.\nThe Frankfurt silver inscription is an engraving on silver foil that consists of 18 lines written in Latin. It dates to between 230 and 260 A.D. and was discovered wrapped in a small silver amulet.\nIn a press release translated from German, the museum explained that the artifact was found in a third-century grave in Hesse, Germany, in what was once the former Roman city of Nida. The inscription begins, \"In the name of Saint Titus, Holy, holy, holy! In the name of Jesus Christ, God's Son!\"\nARTIFACT WITH STRANGE INSCRIPTION DUG UP AT HOLY SITE IN JERUSALEM: 'UNUSUAL LOCATION'\nSaint Titus was a first-century Christian missionary and disciple of Paul the Apostle. The inscription also calls for the amulet to protect \"the man who gives to the will the Lord Jesus Christ, God's Son.\"\n\"The heavenly, the earthly and the underground, and every tongue confess (to Jesus Christ),\" the text concludes.\nWritten in Latin, the inscription took several weeks to decipher due to its deteriorated condition. Archaeologists needed to \"digitally unroll\" the silver foil, which had been crumpled for around 1,800 years.\nUsing computed tomography and state-of-the-art technological equipment, the text was finally decrypted in May. It was then translated over an extended period of time.\nARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST CHRISTIAN CHURCHES\n\"Sometimes it took weeks, even months, for me to have the next idea,\" Goethe University professor Markus Scholz said of the translation process. \"I brought in experts from the history of theology, among other things, and piece by piece we have approached the text together and ultimately deciphered it.\"\nScholz added that the inscription was \"very sophisticated\" and called its author \"an elaborate writer.\"\n\"It is unusual that the inscription is completely in Latin,\" Scholz said. \"This is unusual for this time. Such inscriptions were usually written in amulets in Greek or Hebrew.\"\nNot only is the inscription not written in Hebrew, it doesn't reference Judaism at all, nor does it contain any pagan elements, which makes it even more unique.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\"It is unusual that there is no reference in the inscription to any other belief besides Christianity,\" the museum's press release added. \"Usually until the fifth century, a mixture of different faiths can always be expected with precious metal amulets of this kind. Often there are still elements from Judaism or pagan influences.\"\n\"But in this amulet neither Yahweh, the almighty God of Judaism, nor the archangels Raphael, Gabriel, Michael or Suriel are mentioned, no forefathers of Israel like Isaac or Jacob. And also no pagan elements like demons. The amulet is purely Christian.\"\nThe press release called the artifact \"one of the most important testimonies of early Christianity worldwide.\"\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle.\n\"So far, there has been no such early, authentic proof of pure Christianity north of the Alps,\" the statement explained. \"All [other] finds are at least around 50 years younger.\"\n\"There are references from historiography to the first Christian groups in Gaul and perhaps also in the province of Upper Germania in the late second century,\" the statement added. \"However, certain evidence of Christian life in the northern Alpine regions of the Roman Empire generally only comes from the fourth century AD.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"These 18 lines, experts agree, will enormously enrich previous research on the spread of Christianity and the late period of Roman rule on the right of the Rhine.\""

      "text": "An archaeologist recently uncovered the likely remains of a long-forgotten Byzantine settlement, offering new insights into the history of Christianity in the Middle East.\nMusallam R. Al-Rawahneh, an associate professor of archaeology at Mu\u2019tah University in Jordan, recently published his findings in the journal Gephyra in May.\nThe archaeologist believes he's uncovered the ancient site of Tharais, guided by the enigmatic Madaba Map \u2013 a remarkable mosaic that has puzzled historians for centuries.\nANCIENT ROMAN MILITARY FORTIFICATIONS FOUND IN 'STRATEGIC LOCATION' IN EGYPT\nSpeaking to Fox News Digital, Al-Rawahneh said he located the site near the Jordanian village of El-\u02bfIr\u0101q, in an area known as Ain Al-Qala\u2019a.\nThough the site was lost to obscurity, the historian said the once-thriving settlement was located \"strategically\" along trade routes to the southeastern Dead Sea region.\nAt the site, Al-Rawahneh and his team uncovered artifacts ranging from pottery shards and stone tools to glass remnants. He also uncovered fossils during his excavation.\nThe area was filled with architectural remains, including a Byzantine church. When asked what was the most interesting finding at the site, Al-Rawahneh pointed to several discoveries, including the Christian church and an olive oil press.\nARCHAEOLOGISTS MAKE GRIM DISCOVERY AFTER FINDING ANCIENT ROMAN BUILDINGS\nThe church, which the historian called \"basilica-style,\" retained fragments of mosaic floors typical of Byzantine Christian sites.\n\"[It] reflects Byzantine design, including a prominent entrance and possible remnants of decorative elements,\" he said.\nArchaeologists also found various inscriptions, which Al-Rawahneh said were linked to ancient funerary practices.\nWhile the inscriptions require further research, the professor said they \"may include Christian imagery and references,\" which will provide more insight into ancient religious practices.\nArchaeologists also found various inscriptions.\nSo what led to Tharais becoming \"lost\"? Al-Rawahneh said the site was abandoned by the 7th century A.D., based on what archaeologists have learned about activity in the area.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nThe expert pointed to changes in trade routes, earthquakes and environmental changes as possible reasons.\nAl-Rawahneh also noted that the area transitioned from Byzantine to Islamic control in the seventh century.\nMore research is in the works, including surveys of surrounding areas and additional analysis of the artifacts that were found, he said.\nIn the future, Al-Rawahneh said he hopes that upcoming research will \"enhance the understanding of Tharais and its significance within the broader context of Byzantine archaeology in Jordan.\"\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\nThe Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, lasted from 330 A.D. to the 15th century.\nThe empire began to take shape in 330 A.D., when Constantine the Great moved the Roman capital to Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople.\nMany fascinating finds from the Byzantine era still turn up in Asia Minor and the Middle East today.\nIn May, Israeli officials put a 1,600-year-old Byzantine-era mosaic from a Christian monastery on public display for the first time.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn Syria, a contractor recently stumbled across a Byzantine tomb complex while clearing rubble."

      "text": "Archaeologists in Turkey recently excavated the ruins of a millennia-old city, revealing a fifth-century Christian church with a message that hasn't been seen in over 1,000 years.\nThe excavation took place at Olympus, an ancient Lycian port city in Turkey\u2019s Antalya province, according to Anadolu Agency (AA), a state-run news outlet in Ankara.\nThe city has been excavated continuously since 2006, but during the recent season, archaeologists uncovered multiple mosaic floors, along with large storage jars called pithoi.\nARCHAEOLOGISTS EXCAVATE ANCIENT WORKSHOP WITH UNFINISHED SCULPTURES ON GREEK ISLAND\nExcavator Gokcen Kurtulus Oztaskin, an associate professor at Pamukkale University, told AA that the site \"continues to surprise us with its mosaics.\"\nThe professor noted that \"in 2017, 2022 and 2023, we discovered richly decorated mosaic floors at the sites we worked on. This year, we uncovered and restored the floor mosaics of Church No. 1.\"\nThe most striking discovery was an inscription found at Church No. 1's entrance.\nOztaskin translated the message as: \"Only those on the righteous path may enter here.\"\nANCIENT CHRISTIAN TOMB COMPLEX REVEALED BENEATH RUBBLE FROM SYRIA'S CIVIL WAR\nOlympus was abandoned by the 12th century \u2014 meaning the inscription has not been seen since.\nThe mosaics also featured vegetable motifs, a common artistic element of the era.\nThe names of benefactors were also visible on the mosaics, indicating that an affluent class once flourished in Olympus.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nExcavators also found a newly uncovered building that resembles a temple, though more work will be done to determine its age and function.\nOlympus was in use for several centuries. It still bears some remnants of Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine architecture.\nArchaeologists have uncovered multiple churches, a bridge and an entrance complex.\nThey also found the Bishop\u2019s Palace, the Antimakhos sarcophagus and the Lycian Marcus Aurelius Archepolis Monumental Tomb.\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\nThe discoveries come on the heels of several recent breakthroughs in early Christian archaeology.\nEarlier this spring, an archaeologist uncovered an ancient Christian settlement in Jordan known as Tharais.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nLast year, historians unveiled the earliest-known evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, in the form of a silver inscription."

  "argos_summary": "Archaeologists uncovered a 1,500\u2011year\u2011old baptistery beside the Vence cathedral in France, revealing a circular structure with a distinctive octagonal\u2011cross font and Roman\u2011style concrete. The find confirms the early establishment of the Vence bishopric and offers new insight into fifth\u2011century Christian baptismal practices. Excavations also uncovered Roman\u2011style burials and a Roman dwelling beneath the cathedral, illustrating six centuries of religious and architectural development in the region. The discovery adds to a series of recent early\u2011Christian finds across Europe, including a silver inscription in Germany and an untouched tomb in Italy.",
