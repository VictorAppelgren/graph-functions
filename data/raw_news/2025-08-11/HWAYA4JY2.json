  "content": "The sporting community was left reeling last month when the legendary Hulk Hogan died at the age of 71.\n\nAnd, on what would have been his 72nd birthday Monday, the world continued to mourn the WWE titan - none more so than the broken family he left behind.\n\nThe maverick had been larger than life in the ring, leaving behind a legacy that transcended the sport. Yet, in his final months, Hollywood Hogan had been left heartbroken.\n\nA bitter rift had torn the icon's family apart. At the time of his death, the man born as Terry Bollea had gone two years without speaking to his daughter Brooke, 37, while his ex-wife Linda had accused him of being behind the fractured family's bitter feud.\n\nNow, as he celebrated his dad's birthday at Hogan's forthcoming Slam Sports Bar, his son Nick, has remained tight-lipped on his own relationship with his older sister.\n\n'We've spoken,' was all the 35-year-old offered to the Daily Mail when asked if the tragic passing of their father had strengthened his sibling bond with the TV personality.\n\nNick, who Linda hailed as 'such a good boy' during her bombshell expose of the family's private life earlier this year, toasted his father's birthday outside Madison Square Garden, a significant landmark in Hogan's career.\n\nHe and Hogan's former business partner Rich Rosen gathered to unveil a banner on the corner of Eighth Avenue and 31st Street - the site of his dad's future $7million sports bar and final project before his death.\n\nLess than a week ago, Nick was saying goodbye to his father in an intimate funeral. Hogan's ex-wife Linda, whom he was married to from from 1983 to 2009, was even spotted exiting the private memorial service, despite their differences in the months before his death.\n\nIn contrast, Brooke and her husband, ex-NHL player Steven Oleksy, snubbed the family's arrangements to remember the late wrestler last week, opting against attending Hogan's funeral at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Largo, Florida.\n\nInstead, the couple, who tied the knot in 2022 without her father present, chose to honor him by taking their twin children, daughter Molly and son Oliver, to Hogan's 'favorite place': the beach.\n\nWithout his sister, Nick sought solace in his mom as well as his stepmother and Hogan's third wife, Sky Daily, as they joined the devastated mourners to say their final farewells to the 'Hulkster' at the touching ceremony last Tuesday.\n\n'Everybody comes together in these moments, and it's been incredibly difficult,' he told the Daily Mail. 'He was such a great family man. To lose him has just been devastating for all of us, but we've all really tried to come together and do what we feel would honor him best, and to honor his legacy. We know that he's looking over all of us.'\n\nFamous WWE faces Triple H and former co-CEO Stephanie McMahon as well as musician Kid Rock and comedian Theon Von were among the grieving attendees. However, one particular sporting star had a surprisingly emotional reaction to the loss.\n\nA heartbroken Dennis Rodman, the former NBA bad boy renowned for his bold personality, on-court tenacity and wild lifestyle, was reduced to tears as he said goodbye to his good friend, the Daily Mail has learned.\n\nThe five-time NBA champion formed a close friendship with Hogan after making his professional wrestling debut as a member of the 'New World Order' with him.\n\n'It was the most beautiful Memorial I've ever been at in my life,' Hogan's business partner Rosen, who was preparing to open Slam Sport Bar with the wrestler before his death, said.\n\n'Very sad, but touching. Incredible to see all his contemporaries and his beautiful wife, Sky, and his son, Nick, and his manager, all the people who loved him truly loved him.\n\n'Even Dennis Rodman was crying on top of his coffin at the memorial. It was just very touching.'\n\n'He's gone, but he's still here. His spirit is thriving. Everywhere I go, I see red and yellow,' he added.\n\nNick has played a central role in the tributes to his father. He was caught trying to fight back tears during the 10-bell salute at WWE SummerSlam 2025. His wife Tana Lea was also seen wiping away tears after joining her husband on stage for the event.\n\nThe WWE's tribute to Hogan was just one of many that flooded in following his death. Yet the most notable came from the White House.\n\n'My dad and the President were friends for a really long time, and he would have been so excited about that and so proud of that moment,' Nick said of Donald Trump's message. 'And we thank the President very much for the tribute and the kind words that he shared about my father.'\n\nIn the months before his death, Hogan and Rosen had planned to open Slam, a bar in the heart of Manhattan, overlooking Madison Square Garden where he made his WWE debut in 1979.\n\nAnd while the wrestling titan is no longer around to see the sports bar open its doors, it intends to honor Hogan by pushing forward with its opening later this year with Nick touchingly stepping into his father's shoes.\n\nWorking closely with Hogan throughout his final months, Rosen insisted the former wrestler had shown no signs of slowing down, despite the fears surrounding his rumored decline in health.\n\n'His final week I received a call from him, and before he passed, he said, \"I'm making a big comeback, brother,\"' Rosen revealed. 'He sounded tired, but he didn't sound terrible. He sounded pretty good.\n\n'I believed every inch that he would be making a big comeback. I just said, just stay home for three months and Hulk up and come back and we'll be ready for you.'\n\nHogan poured his heart into the project and while he tragically won't see out its completion, both Nick and Rosen insist the bar will be a living tribute to 'Hulkmania.'\n\n'Hogan's death has actually intensified it greatly,' Rosen said of the importance of cementing his legacy through the bar.\n\n'We actually had a kick off meeting the morning he passed. But now, it changed everything. Everything is much more significant now. Now it's a tribute to him, and it's a tribute to his fans. It intensified the significance of the project immensely.'\n\nHogan's life in the public eye wasn't without controversy. He survived many a scandal in the years before his death.\n\nThere was a leaked sex-tape including a racist rant, an affair with his daughter's best friend, and political stances which turned even some the Hulksters' most avid fans against him.\n\nAnd while have some have tried to tarnish his father's legacy in the weeks since his death, Nick insisted he had no retort, choosing instead to reflect on the highs, rather than the lows.\n\n'His legacy is so broad,' he said. 'There's so many great moments, and I think that's what we want everyone to focus on, especially through Slam Sports Bar, is to celebrate those iconic moments, the WrestleMania moments, all the birth of Hulkamania, the WWE, everything that was so iconic about his career, that's the legacy that we want all the fans to remember and to celebrate forever.'",

      "text": "How Hulk Hogan's family life fell apart: From hit reality TV show with his children to cheating scandals, leaked sex tapes and a bitter divorce - with third wife set to take staggering share of WWE icon's fortune after death\nA larger-than-life character who became an undisputed legend of wrestling as a young man, Hulk Hogan captured the attention of the public in his later years for far different reasons.\nThe maverick, who transcended his sport and became a household name across the globe, died last week at his home in Clearwater, Florida, after suffering cardiac arrest aged 71.\nHe'd survived many a scandal in the years before his death and was arguably one of the most controversial figures in sporting history.\nThere was a leaked sex-tape including a racist rant, an affair with his daughter's best friend, and political stances which turned even some the Hulksters' most avid fans against him.\nWhat left Hollywood Hogan 'heartbroken' in his final months, however, was a rift which tore him away from his family. At the time of his death, he hadn't spoken to his daughter Brooke for more than two years, with his ex-wife Linda accusing him of tearing his own family apart.\n'We're in the worst mess,' she claimed in an astonishing video in March. But how did a family so close-knit, who once starred in their own reality show, become so fractured?\nHulk Hogan died after suffering cardiac arrest at his Clearwater, Florida, last week (pictured in October 2024)\nThe wrestling icon is thought to have been 'heartbroken' in the months before his death after a feud tore his family apart (pictured L-R: Hulk, Brooke, Lisa and Nick Hogan in 2005)\nSix foot 8in Hogan, born Terry Bollea, began his journey into wrestling in 1976 when he was scouted to enter the sport after idolising Dusty Rhodes and 'Superstar' Billy Graham during his youth.\nIt wasn't until eight years later that the muscle mountain earned himself a full-time spot in the WWF, a platform which would shoot Hogan to stardom over the proceeding years.\nBut 1983 wasn't only significant in terms of the Georgia-born wrestler's career - it was also the year he tied the knot with his first wife Linda.\nThe pair hit it off immediately when they met two years earlier, as Hogan recalled in his 2009 autobiography: 'There was just something about Linda. She didn't care about the fame or the wrestling thing - she saw me, Terry, the person. That meant everything to me.'\n'The good ol' days' in the 1980s, as Linda referred them in a tribute to Hogan following his passing, were indeed seemingly filled with love between the newly-weds.\nAs the blonde behemoth rose to the top of Wrestlemania donning his iconic red and white costume, he and Linda were raising their two children, Brooke (born in 1988) and Nick (born in 1990).\nThe family became the subject of interest from a number of production companies as the kids grew older and the popularity of reality TV boomed.\nAfter the astounding success of The Osbournes - which followed the late Ozzy Osbourne and his family at their Los Angeles home - Hogan was first pitched a television series in 2002, but turned the proposition down.\nHogan rose to fame after earning himself a full-time spot in the WWF in 1983 (pictured a year later in action with Iron Sheik)\nIt was the same year he tied the knot with his first wife Linda, after the pair enjoyed a whirlwind romance in the early 1980s (pictured in 1996)\nThe divisive superstar, then aged 50, agreed to allow cameras into his home three years later, with the first episode of the iconic 'Hogan Knows Best' airing in July 2005.\nThe wrestler later revealed that he only agreed to the show in a bid help his children kickstart their own careers.\n'I was offered lots of reality shows when I was making my career comeback against The Rock,' he told Fox News. 'But I kept saying no. Years later, it was my daughter's career and my son's racing career that we were thinking about it.'\nWhile warning his family 'what they were getting themselves into', Hogan hoped the series could show a different side to the bellowing wrestler the public had become accustomed to.\n'They (fans) don't realise that I go to soccer games, play frisbee, watch The Lion King and start crying,' he candidly revealed in one of the show's early episodes.\nProducers tried to portray Hogan as a gentle giant, with the wrestler devoting himself to his daughter's career. Cameras would follow him and Brooke at label meetings, recording studios and their family home.\nBut while Hogan may have thought he was helping his aspiring popstar daughter, viewers branded him overbearing and controlling. He monitored her phone calls, interrogated her boyfriends and, in one shocking scene, attached a tracker to her car.\nHe seemed far more of a hinderance to Brooke's singing career than a help. The blundering blonde was often an embarrassment to his daughter as he tried to secure her a record deal.\nThe Hogan family gained the widespread attention of the public when Hogan Knows Best aired in 2005 (pictured in 2006)\nProducers aimed to show Hogan's softer side in the reality show, with him spending time with his daughter Brooke (pictured in 2004)\nIn one amusing scene, he even hired an airplane banner to send a message to American producer Scott Storch. 'YO STORCH, SIGN MY DAUGHTER ALREADY, SHE'S THE BOMB!', it read.\nThe series garnered a huge wave of attention, but it ultimately came crashing down as quickly as it rose to prominence.\nHogan Knows Best was cancelled after four seasons in 2007 amid the breakdown of Hulk and his wife Lisa's 26-year marriage over the bombshell accusation that he had cheated with his daughter's best friend, Christiane Plante. A 'furious' Linda filed for divorce after learning of her husband's adultery, which came after rumours of various flings circulated.\nThe pair's relationship had reportedly been on the rocks for years, with Linda admitting 'sometimes they hated each other' during the filming of Hogan Knows Best.\nHogan however denied allegations of cheating in his 2009 My Life Outside The Ring autobiography, despite Christiane confirming she and the sporting icon had enjoyed a brief romance.\n'My relationship with Hulk began at a time when he and Linda privately knew their marriage was ending,' she said in an interview with the National Enquirer.\n'She had left him already, although no official papers had been filed. He is a good man, good father, and good friend, and he and I grew close at a time when he was going through a very difficult period. It seemed right then, but I know it was wrong.'\nThe scandalous affair marked the beginning of Hogan and his daughter's long-lasting feud, with Brooke taking to MySpace accusing her father of 'betrayal'.\nHogan Knows Best was however cancelled in 2007 after claims of Hulk's infidelity were aired (pictured in 2006)\nLinda claimed the wrestler had enjoyed a romance with Brooke's best friend (pictured with Brooke in 2006)\nLinda filed for divorce just days after learning of Hulk's affair, which the wrestler denied (pictured together in 2006)\n'When your best friend and one of your closest family members that you have loved unconditionally since your first day on this earth, betray you together, you could MAYBE find it in yourself to forgive today,' she posted.\n'But you will NEVER forget the hurt they caused you and how it hurt the people who mean the most to you.'\nLinda and Hulk's divorce was finalised two years later in 2009. As part of the settlement, she took a huge portion of her former lover's riches. Linda seized 70 per cent of their liquid assets, 40 per cent ownership of Hulk's various business and the couple's \u00a32.23million Florida home.\nBut the confirmation of their divorce was far from the end of Hulk - who moved on just a year later with his second wife Jennifer McDaniel - and Linda's troubles in court.\nHulk accused his ex-wife of being an abusive alcoholic who threatened to beat their son with a wine bottle in his 2009 memoir. By this time, news of 48-year-old Linda's new 'toyboy' Charley Hill, just 19, had been made public.\nHer new lover also sparked a fiery response from Brooke, who accused her mother of 'smoking all her cares away and having a play-date' in her 2009 song Dear Mom...\nTwo years later however and it was time for Linda to have her say in her own autobiography, aptly titled Wrestling the Hulk: My Life Against the Ropes.\nThe reality star claimed she lived in fear of Hogan killing her in one of his drug-fueld rages during their marriage. She wrote: 'He tore my shirt, held me down on the bed with his hands around my throat. I was afraid he would kill me in one his rages.'\nHulk Hogan is pictured with his second wife Jennifer McDaniel in 2012\nLinda said she chose not to speak about the alleged abuse prior to the memoir as she didn't want to end her husband's glittering career at the forefront of WWE.\nIn a bombshell allegation, she also accused Hogan of engaging in a sexual relationship with his fellow WWE star Brutus Beefcake - something the two wrestlers vehemently denied.\nThe accusations of abuse prompted a lawsuit from Hogan, who sued for defamation claiming the abuse 'exposed him to distrust, hatred, contempt and ridicule.' The lawsuit was however dismissed in 2012 - the same year Hulk's biggest controversy surfaced.\nIt came when gossip blog Gawker posted a sex tape of Hulk and Heather Clem, the wife of his then-best friend Bubba the Love Sponge, which had been taken in 2006 without the star's knowledge.\nHulk, who said he'd been given the blessing of his pal ahead of the sexual encounter, claimed the video was taken at a 'low point' during his and Linda's crumbling marriage.\nBut what was most damning about the leaked video was that it captured a racist rant from Hogan about his daughter dating a black man.\nIn 2015, several publications reported transcripts from court documents in which the blonde hunk could be heard saying: 'I mean, I'd rather if she was going to f*** some n*****, I'd rather her marry an eight-foot-tall n***** worthy a hundred million dollars!\n'Like a basketball player. I guess we're all a little racist. f*****g n*****!'\nThe star's biggest scandal came in 2012 when a sex tape emerged including a racist rant from Hogan (pictured in 2016)\nHogan sued Gawker, the publication who released the sex tape, and eventually agreed to a $31million (\u00a323.4m) settlement (pictured with his lawyers in 2012)\nThe tirade seriously tainted the WWE legend's legacy, with him chucked out of the franchise and admitting he was left 'at an all-time low'.\n'Please forgive me,' the 12-time world champ pleaded - both to America as a whole and to his daughter Brooke, whose boyfriend was the focus of the then 62-year-old's racist tirade.\n'If anybody should have disowned me it should have been her,' said Hogan. 'I was upset about something that happened between her and her boyfriend.'\nJust days after the video sent shockwaves through the world of Showbiz, Hogan filed a lawsuit against Gawker claiming emotional distress and invasion of privacy.\nHe was secretly being backed by billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, who is thought to have paid for the lawsuit in the first place. Theil allegedly involved himself with the aim of destroying Gawker, a publication which outed him as homosexual in 2007.\nAnd Hogan managed to do just that, with a Florida jury awarding him $115million in compensatory damages and $25m in punitive damages. Both parties however later agreed to a $31m settlement, which left Gawker bankrupt.\nWhile dealing with the tainting of his public image, Hulk was too contending with the the breakdown of his relationship with his daughter in the years before his death.\nFollowing his scandalous affair with her best-friend and a number of 'separate reasons', Brooke ultimately became estranged from her father in 2023.\nLinda claimed the Hogan family were 'in the worst mess' in the months before the wrestler died\nShe had supported Hulk through 'almost 25 surgeries' as his health declined in his latter years, but the wrestling icon apparently 'didn't want' her by his side anymore.\n'All of a sudden he didn't want me at surgeries... everything started getting covered in a thick veil,' she wrote in a tribute to her father following his death.\n'We never had a \"big fight\". My father and I never \"fought\". It was a series of private phone calls no one will ever hear, know, or understand.'\nBrooke and Hulk had their final conversation over the phone a couple of weeks before he married his third wife Sky Daily in 2023.\nOn that call, Brooke expressed her love and concern for him - telling Hogan that he shouldn't be working so hard due to his declining health. Despite her pleas for him to enjoy more of his life, those requests fell on deaf ears. The pair didn't speak again.\nDespite multiple attempts from her husband, Steven Oleksy, to fix their relationship, including when Brooke almost died in childbirth in January of this year, Hulk 'responded coldly and never made an effort to meet Brooke's kids,' per TMZ.\nThe final public rift in the Hogan family came just a couple months before Hulk's death when his ex-wife Linda accused him of being a 'complete liar' and 'sex addict'. She too claimed that the family was in 'the worst mess'.\nBrooke later retaliated, hitting back at her mother by alleging that her father was not the only reason behind the shocking family divide, claiming she was 'verbally and mentally abused' during her childhood.\nHogan is pictured with his third and final wife Sky Daily, who is expected to inherit 30 per cent of his fortune\nHulk's daughter Brooke (centre) is thought to have removed herself from his will in 2023 (pictured with Linda and Hulk in 2004)\nAfter Brooke's stunning response, Linda then took a dramatic U-turn by defending Hogan and branding her daughter a 'narcissist.'\nThe family didn't get the chance to reconcile before Hogan passed away earlier this month.\nA source told the Daily Mail in April that he was 'heartbroken' over the deterioration of his and Brooke's relationship.\nBoth Brooke and Linda paid tribute to their father following his passing, with his daughter hailing their 'deeper than words connection' and his former wife of 26 years admitting 'I loved Hulkster more than he loved me!'\nHis son Nick, who took a neutral stance on the fallout and spent time with his father in his final years, also paid tribute. He wrote: 'Thank you for being the best dad in the world and thank you for being my best friend. I love you so much Big Dog and will miss you forever.'\nThe question that now persists is, who will inherit Hulk's fortune?\nHe's estimated to have left behind an estate worth around $25million, which includes high-value assets such as his $11.5m Clearwater mansion and a number of business ventures including his Hogan's Hangout restaurant and the recently launched Real American Beer.\nUnder Florida's spousal elective share statute, Hogan's third third wife Sky is entitled to 30 per cent of his assets despite the couple only being married two years.\nIt remains unclear where the rest of the fortune will land but, according to TMZ, Brooke won't inherit a penny.\nThe 37-year-old mother-of-two reportedly asked to be removed from Hogan's will in 2023 over fears she would be caught in a bitter financial battle in the wake of her father's death.\nBrooke, who apparently did not trust anyone in the wrestler's inner circle, said she's never been motivated by her father's fortune."

'Both knees and both hips replaced, shoulders - everything.'\nWhile he is not on his deathbed, Hogan did spark fears over his health after making a bizarre appearance on Fox News last month.\nFans were left concerned when he appeared as a special guest on Fox & Friends at the start of May sporting a worrying new look.\nRenowned for his deep tan, the WWE great's skin looked particularly weathered on air, while his usual white beard appeared to be dyed black despite his goatee and hair being left white - making for a strange contrast.\nOne viewer wrote on social media: 'tell Hulk Hogan his face is dirty, clean that soot off.'\nAnother said: 'Does anyone believe this is Hulk Hogan?'\nHogan was on the show to promote his new wrestling league, Real American Freestyle, but appeared to ramble as the interview went on."

He had been taken ill at his home in Clearwater, Florida before being pronounced dead in hospital.\nMourners arrived at the church - which is located around seven miles south of his Clearwater home - Tuesday to say their final farewells to the wrestling legend.\nA hearse carrying Hogan's coffin pulled up outside the place of worship before eight pallbearers carried him into the church.\nThe pallbearers paid an emotional tribute to Hogan as they sported yellow roses on the lapels of their black suit jackets - a nod to the bright color the late wrestler famously wore during his career in the ring.\nHulk Hogan's devastated friends and family gathered in Florida for his funeral on Tuesday\nHogan's ex-wife Linda, who was married to the wrestler from 1983 to 2009, exits the service\nThe wrestling legend died last month at the age of 71 after suffering a cardiac arrest\nHogan's ex-wife Linda, who was married to the wrestler from 1983 to 2009, was seen exiting the service, despite their differences in the months before his death.\nLinda, who shares daughter Brooke, 37, and son Nick, 35, with the late Hogan, accused her former husband of being a 'complete liar' and 'sex addict' in a video back in March. She also claimed their family is 'in the worst mess' after Brooke cut both parents out of her life.\nAmong the other attendees at the private service were other famous WWE faces Triple H and former co-CEO Stephanie McMahon, according to People. Musician Kid Rock and comedian Theon Von were also said to have been in attendance to say their goodbyes.\nAccording to his death certificate, he is going to be cremated at Pinellas County Forensic Center in Clearwater, though a specific date has not yet been announced for that.\nHogan's death came after weeks of speculation about his health. While he was known to be struggling, he had kept news about his leukemia diagnosis out of the public before his death.\nHogan also previously had atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm, a report from the District Six Medical Examiner said.\nHe also revealed he had 25 surgeries in the last decade - including 10 back operations, replacements on his knee and hip, and procedures on both shoulders.\nHogan was pronounced dead at a hospital less than 90 minutes after medics arrived at his home in Clearwater to answer a call about a cardiac arrest on the morning of July 24, police said.

'To the world, he was a legend... but to me, he was my Terry.'\nHogan was perhaps the biggest star in WWE's long history, known for both his larger-than-life personality and his in-ring exploits.\nHe was the main draw for the first WrestleMania in 1985 and was a fixture for years, facing everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even WWE co-founder Vince McMahon.\nBut outside the the ring, Hogan also found trouble. WWE cut ties with him in 2015 for three years, even removing him from its Hall of Fame, after it was reported that he was recorded using racial slurs. He apologized and said his words were 'unacceptable.'\nHogan won at least six WWE championships and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2005 and reinstated there in 2018.\nHogan was also a celebrity outside the wrestling world, appearing in numerous movies and television shows, including a reality show about his life on VH1, 'Hogan Knows Best.'\nIn recent years, Hogan added his celebrity to politics. At the 2024 Republican National Convention, he merged classic WWE maneuvers with then-candidate Donald Trump's rhetoric to passionately endorse him for president.\nHogan and daughter Brooke were estranged for years, but she spoke with him before his death\nNick Hogan fought back tears after an emotional tribute to his late father at SummerSlam 2025\n'We lost a great friend today, the 'Hulkster,' Trump said on Truth Social after Hogan's death. 'Hulk Hogan was MAGA all the way - Strong, tough, smart, but with the biggest heart.'\nHogan's son, Nick, had a front row seat at WWE SummerSlam 2025 in New Jersey on Saturday night and appeared to fight tears back when a tribute was made to his father.\nThe tribute showcased photos of Hogan from throughout his WWE career and heaped praise on the 'larger than life' figure and his career inside the squared circle.\nCameras then cut to a visibly moved Nick, who applauded while welling up.\nMeanwhile the wrestler's daughter, Brooke, opened up on her troubled relationship with the wrestling legend in a candid statement in the wake of his death.\n'My dad's blood runs through my veins. His eyes shine through my children. And our bond has never broken, not even in his final moments,' she began in a six-page message on social media.\n'We had a connection deeper than words, one that spanned lifetimes. I am so grateful I knew the real version of him. Not just the one the world viewed through a carefully curated lens.\n'We shared a quiet, sacred bond, one that could be seen and felt by anyone who witnessed us together. When he left this earth, it felt like part of my spirit left with him. I felt it before the news even reached us.'\nBrooke was estranged from both of her parents for years before he passed and she has taken herself out of her father's will.\nAccording to the National Enquirer, Brooke shared a short but heartfelt conversation with her dad in the days before his death.\n'It was a tearful conversation, albeit a short one,' an insider told the outlet.\n'Brooke told her dad how much she loved him, how much she missed him. Hulk said he loved her, and he was sorry.\n'That was huge for Brooke to hear. Everyone knew how stubborn Hulk could be, but his fading health obviously softened him up. He knew he was dying and begged her forgiveness.'\nBrooke's mother Linda, Hulk Hogan's ex-wife, said she was 'melting down' at the news of his death."

      "text": "Inside Hulk Hogan's 'emotional' final hours: Friends in shock over sudden death... as they reveal his deathbed 'heartbreak'\nHulk Hogan was already 'heartbroken' months before his fatal cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater, Florida, on Thursday. He was 71.\nA symbol of American patriotism and machismo who succeeded in everything from wrestling to Hollywood to reality television, the man born Terry Bollea had gone eight years without speaking to his daughter Brooke, 36.\nThe exact details of the estrangement were never fully revealed, but the Daily Mail understands that, despite their ups and downs, Hogan believed - to his dying day - they would reconcile.\n'The last few months of Hogan's life had a lot more ups than downs,' an insider told the Daily Mail.\n'There was a little strain with his daughter and their relationship that had taken quite the emotional toll, but he always thought he would eventually be able to rectify that.'\nIt is also understood that his sudden death has left those closest to him in shock.\nFrom left: Hulk Hogan, his daughter Brooke Hogan, wife Linda Hogan and son Nick Hogan. The family is seen attending the premiere of War Of The Worlds at the Ziegfeld Theatre on June 23, 2005, in New York\nThe reality show, Hogan Knows Best, made a star out of Brooke Hogan (second from left, pictured with her family)\n'He was still extremely close to his son,' our source added. 'It is a surprise and doesn't feel real at all to his family and friends.'\nHogan's career spent in the wrestling ring also took a toll on him - leaving the athlete with 'the body of a 140-year-old man,' one inside source told the Daily Mail in April.\nBut for all of his physical problems, which included a major neck surgery in June, Hogan's final years may be best remembered for his fractured home life, which a source previously revealed left him 'heartbroken'.\nWhile Brooke has never fully confirmed her reasoning for losing touch with Hogan and her mother, Linda, she said in a statement earlier this year that she'd been 'verbally and mentally abused since childhood'.\nShe made sure to stress that the allegations were 'not pointed at either person' and it was revealed on Thursday that Brooke had managed to tell her father she loved him in a final conversation before his death, according to TMZ.\nIt has also been claimed that Brooke's husband, hockey player Steven Oleksy, has made several failed attempts to 'foster peace'.\nWhile Hogan has largely kept quiet about the rift, ex-wife Linda has been vocal, calling him a 'complete liar' and 'sex addict'.\n'I'm just home by myself today,' the 65-year-old mother to Hogan's two children said in a disturbing online video in March. 'Again, as usual, I'm okay with most things, but today something hit. I don't know what hit, but I look terrible because I've been crying.'\nLinda Hogan (pictured) launched into an online rant about her ex, Hogan, and daughter, Brooke, in March\nBrooke and Hogan arrive for the MTV Video Music Awards in 2004\nLamenting the tough '15 years since I left Hulk', Linda complained that her daughter 'doesn't talk to us'.\n'She's had twins, she got married, she didn't tell us,' Linda said before referencing Hogan by his give name, Terry.\n'She had a huge fight with Terry. I don't know how that reflected onto me. But she cut me out, too. I haven't talked to her for seven years - almost eight years now.'\nAs for the couple's other child, 34-year-old Nick, Linda insisted he's a rare bright spot in her life - 'God bless Nick'.\nLinda saved her most vicious comments for her ex-husband, who'd married his third wife, Sky Daily, two years ago.\n'I've given him more opportunities to come back and make us a family,' Linda said.\n'I've never put a Facebook [post] out like this with my ugly face and my crying face, but I have to be honest about what I went through in my marriage with Terry.\n'It's been 20 years and I'm still this sad. Somebody please explain that. I don't know. It just doesn't get better.'\nA younger Hogan is seen with his children Brooke, 3, and Nick, 1, on a floral-print couch\nThe wrestler is captured affectionately rubbing noses with his 3-year-old daughter, Brooke\nAt no point did Linda explain the specifics of her issues with Hogan or Brooke, but the former couple certainly did go through a lot together.\nAfter marrying the WWE legend in 1983, Linda became a celebrity in 2005 through their joint VH1 reality show, Hogan Knows Best.\nBut while the show was popular, Nick struggled with fame, resulting in a number of high-speed auto collisions. The worst came in 2007, when Nick's 22-year-old friend and passenger John Graziano was left with permanent injuries due to the single-car crash.\nLinda, then 48, filed for divorce soon after and quickly began dating a 19-year-old man, although their relationship ultimately fizzled.\nThings didn't get any better for Linda as she was arrested in 2012 for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol.\nMeanwhile, Hogan was having his own problems.\nMonths earlier, he was caught in bed with the wife of is friend and radio personality, Bubba the Love Sponge, which led to another major scandal.\nHogan ultimately sued gossip site Gawker for $100 million for defamation, loss of privacy and emotional pain, although it was later revealed that billionaire Peter Thiel helped Hogan finance the case. Gawker later settled for $31 million.\nHogan is seen with his ex wife, Linda, early in their marriage, while boating on the Gulf Coast\nHogan is seen with Donald Trump in 1987. Decades later, he'd support the President on the campaign trail\nPublicly, Hogan remained his same boisterous self. Before his death, he launched his own beer brand and became known as an ardent Donald Trump supporter.\nHe endorsed Trump's presidential candidacy at the 2024 GOP convention and later spoke in favor of his fellow reality TV star at a Madison Square Garden rally in October. He even pitched himself to be Trump's Vice President before JD Vance was chosen.\nBut in some corners, his act was growing tired, especially after Hogan was recorded using racist slurs in 2015.\nIn a video made public by The National Enquirer, Hogan said 'I guess we're all a little racist' and used the n-word while referring to his daughter's love life, repeating the phrase 'f***ing n******' several times.\nAnger over the incident continued into this year as Hogan was booed during a rare WWE appearance in Los Angeles.\nBut even with his declining public popularity, Hogan remained more concerned about his estranged daughter.\n'It has been a very trying few months for Terry, but he isn't allowing it to get to him, and he is living his life the way he wants to live it,' a source told the Daily Mail in April.\n'He's heartbroken that he doesn't have a relationship with his daughter and would love someday to rectify that.'"

Instead, she took the personal decision to celebrate her father's life in her own private way.\n'My father hated the morbidity of funerals. He didn't want one,' Brooke, 37, explained on Instagram Tuesday evening.\n'And although I know people grieve in many ways - and I'm so grateful for all celebrations and events organized to honor him, as his daughter, I had to make my own decision to honor him the best way I knew how...privately...the way that made me feel the closest to him. The only thing missing today was him in is pop up lawn chair watching the waves... and the sunset.'\nAlongside her emotional caption, the TV personality, who welcomed twins - a boy and a girl - wither her husband, ex-NHL player Steven Oleksy in January, shared a series of touching photos of the young family.\nHulk Hogan's daughter Brooke revealed why she chose not to attend the WWE icon's funeral\nHogan's devastated friends and family gathered in Florida for his funeral on Tuesday\nEarlier in the day, Brooke had announced that she would be taking her children to Hogan's 'favorite place', the beach. And her carousel of photos, showed the twins, Oliver Andrew and Molly Gene, frollicking in the water as she and Oleksy held them along the shore.\n'Daddy, we honored you in the simplest, most genuine way that agreed with my soul. We took our babies to the beach, and put them in the same salty waters you loved,' she continued.\n'Molly loved the water. I think she'll be a \"little fish\" as you called me. We love you and honor the things that made you so special. Every grain of sand and every wave reminded me of being your beach baby, and brought us closer to you. I pray you are at peace and know how dearly I love you.\n'Rest in heaven, Daddy\u2764\ufe0f'\nIt was revealed last week that Brooke, who is the daughter of Hogan and his ex-wife Linda, would not inherit a single dime from his will.\nHulk welcomed Brooke as well as son Nick, 35, with Linda - whom he was married to from 1983 to 2009.\nHe later tied the knot with Jennifer McDaniel in 2010 until their divorce in 2021. Two years later, the WWE legend said 'I do' to Sky Daily and the pair were married up until his death.\nShortly after his wife's own tribute, Oleksy, who is best known for his stints with the Washington Capitals and Pittsburgh Penguins, shared his own touching message to his late father-in-law.\nThe TV personality had shared a tense relationship with her dad towards the end of his life\nBrooke said she hose to honor her late father privately at his 'favorite place', the beach\n'While I may not have been part of the journey from the very beginning, I was fortunate to witness the kind of love my wife had for you\u2014a love so powerful it set a bar I can only hope to reach as I begin my own journey as a father to our daughter,' his open letter, addressed to 'sir,' read in part.\n'It was deep, unwavering, and beautifully raw. Through good times and bad, she loved you with everything she had. Her mission in life was to protect you. That kind of love doesn\u2019t fade.'\nHogan, real name Terry Bollea, died from a cardiac arrest on July 24 and was also fighting leukemia at the time of his passing. He had been taken ill at his home in Clearwater, Florida before being pronounced dead in hospital.\nBy then, Hogan had gone years without speaking to Brooke and, according to Oleksy, had 'no interest' in meeting his daughter's twins.\nThe family rift spilled into the open earlier this year , when Hogan's ex-wife Linda branded him a 'complete liar' and a 'sex addict', while Brooke claimed she was 'verbally and mentally abused' during her childhood.\nAnd earlier this month, Oleksy has opened up on why Brooke turned away from her dad.\nHogan married his third wife, Daily, in 2023. Brooke did not attend the wedding but her husband told PEOPLE that it was 'not the case at all' that Brooke cut communications because she disapproved of the relationship. In fact, Oleksy accused Hogan of pushing that false narrative.\n'My wife will say it \u2014 it had nothing to do with his new wife. It had to do with the way he treated (Brooke),' Oleksy said. 'It was a situation where she loved her dad very, very much.'\nShe shared a series of photos of her twins, Oliver and Molly, and her husband Steve Oleksy\nBrooke welcomed twins with husband Steven Oleksy in January but Hogan never met them\nBut Oleksy claimed that Brooke paid a heavy price for standing by her father, who was caught at the center of several scandals - including when he used racial slurs in reference to her ex-boyfriend. That support had 'really taken a toll on her,' her husband said.\nOleksy and Brooke tied the knot in June 2022 without Hogan. Oleksy claims that the wrestling legend told him he ' doesn't do weddings or funerals anymore.'\nAnd the final straw, according to Oleksy, was a 'series of phone calls' between father and daughter when ' there were some things said, and a lot of mistruths.'\nFollowing Hogan's death, Brooke released a heartbreaking statement in which she said she 'had to step away to protect my heart.'\n'My dad's blood runs through my veins. His eyes shine through my children. And our bond has never broken, not even in his final moments.'\nShe continued: 'We had a connection deeper than words, one that spanned lifetimes.

When he left this earth, it felt like part of my spirit left with him. I felt it before the news even reached us.'\nTowards the end of his life, Brooke claimed, Hogan 'made a choice to walk the path that clearly tore at his spirit,' adding that she 'felt a disconnect. What followed were respectful disagreements that took an emotional toll on me.'\nHogan, who died at age 71 after suffering fatal cardiac arrest, is survived by his wife, Sky Daily\nHulk Hogan (right) is pictured with his ex-wife Linda, son Nick and daughter Brooke in 2006\n'During the last two years, I had to step away to protect my heart. My husband stayed open, quietly reaching out to my dad without me knowing, trying to find a safe way back in for me. After my father passed, I read those messages, some answered, some ignored... but all of them broke my heart.'\nShe insisted: 'We never had a \"big fight.\" My father and I never \"fought.\" It was a series of private phone calls no one will ever hear, know, or understand.'\nEarlier this week, it was revealed that Brook won't be left anything in her father's will .\nAccording to TMZ , the 37-year-old feared being caught up in a bitter financial battle in the wake of her father's death and didn't trust anyone in his inner circle.\nSo she asked to be removed as a beneficiary of his estate in 2023 - the same year as her final conversation with the wrestling icon.\nBrooke reportedly attempted to address the issue with her father but after years of disagreements and her words falling on deaf ears, she contacted his financial manager and made the decision to be excluded from the will."

      "text": "Hulk Hogan's estranged daughter Brooke has accused her mother of lying - and provided evidence to prove it - as their bitter family feud took yet another twist on Thursday.\nThe WWE legend's ex-wife Linda posted a troubling video earlier this week in which she sobbed uncontrollably and accused Hogan of being a 'complete liar' and a 'sex addict'.\nShe also accused the wrestling icon, whose real name is Terry Bollea, of leaving their family 'in the worst mess' after Brooke cut both her parents out of her life.\nThe drama escalated on Thursday, when Brooke fired back at her mom and insisted her father was not the only reason behind the divide.\nLinda responded by denying she ever abused her daughter and even claimed she was attacked herself. She accused Brooke of being 'a narcissist just like her dad' and claimed 'I haven't talked to her for seven years \u2013 almost eight years now'.\nBut now her daughter - who married former NHL star Steven Oleksy in 2022 - has responded by posting a family picture, purportedly from June 2023, which she says disproves her mother's claims.\nBrooke Oleksky, daughter of Hulk Hogan, has posted a family picture purportedly from 2023\nIt comes after Linda Hogan hit back at daughter Brooke's claims she was abused\nBrooke (pictured with Hogan in 2006) denied her dad is the only reason she has cut all contact\n'First of all. it appears my mother may not have actually read what I wrote,' she wrote on social media. 'She absolutely did make false claims like she had \"never met my husband and she doesn't even know what his name is,\" then deleted it.\n'She says she hasn't spoken to me for a number of years, yet I have a picture with her and my husband together on a day we did lunch together.\n'I did not ask for this, nor did I even want to make a statement, but I also couldn't let people continue to speak for me. My name is continuously brought up in the constant drama of my family.\n'My post did not directly accuse anyone of the behaviors mentioned. So if she's triggered by something, I think that speaks volumes.\n'She is however making a serious accusation against me directly that has zero validity. And THAT I take seriously.\nI have plenty of people who know the truth, and I know the truth, so I am not afraid. I showed compassion for her in my post. At this point, I think her response says more about her than it does about me.'\nFollowing accusations that the family picture was 'photoshopped', Brooke provided a time stamp of the 'live photo' on her iPhone.\nHogan and Linda were married for 26 years between 1983 and 2009. They have two children together - Brooke, 36, and Nick, 34.\nHogan remarried in 2010, tying the knot with Jennifer McDaniel, but they split 11 years later. He married his third wife - Sky Daily - in 2023, in a ceremony that Brooke did not attend.\nBrooke (center) claims she was subjected to verbal and mental abuse during her childhood\nLinda has not remarried since her divorce from Hogan. In her video on Wednesday, she hit out at Hogan for preventing her from having a relationship with Brooke, who welcomed twins with Olesky in January.\n'It\u2019s been 15 however long years since I left Hulk Hogan and my family is the worst mess,' a tearful Linda explained.\n'Brooke doesn\u2019t talk to us. She had twins, she got married [and] she didn\u2019t tell us. She had a huge fight with Terry. I don't know how that reflected onto me. But she cut me out too. I haven't talked to her for seven years \u2013 almost eight years now.'\nBrooke gave her own version of events on Thursday, claiming she was 'verbally and mentally abused' during her childhood.\nAddressing her decision to cut ties with her mother and father, Brooke wrote: 'I have completely separate reasons for going no contact with each of my parents. No contact with my Mom has nothing to do with my Dad, and no contact with my Father has nothing to do with my Mother.\n'This also pertains to my dad's second and third, now current wife. This decision was made based purely on how they have each dealt with me directly my entire life.'\nShe added: 'I have been EXTREMELY verbally and mentally abused since childhood. Sadly, it would frequently turn physical. And sometimes it's not by the person you would assume, abuse comes in all shapes and sizes.'\nBrooke claimed she had tried to repair her relationship with her parents, but had finally decided that she needed to move on without them in her life.\nHulk Hogan (right) and Linda Hogan (left) were married for 26 years before splitting in 2009\n'I so badly wanted to see good in them, protect, help, and start anew - just to be disrespected again and again,' she wrote. 'I longed for a normal family, but it never came to fruition.\n'I've repeatedly held my hand out to help them, only to have them pull me into the darkness with them. I've set boundaries that were not respected, and at this point, I can truly do no more.'\nLinda hit back at those comments and then posted another message to social media on Thursday. 'Don't let anyone manipulate you into thinking \"all you want to do is argue\" just because you're expressing how they hurt you or how they make you feel,' she wrote.\n'That's a NARCISSIST. Get away from them, you'll never win.'\nShe had earlier responded to Brooke with a lengthy statement, posted to her Facebook account. 'Seems narcissism runs deep in this family,' it said.\n'Brooke is a narcissist just like her dad... going out... spewing lies to everyone and I'm supposed to defend my truth against that.'\n'I'm not about to do that... it seems to me that she doesn't want the truth being revealed to her new husband and his family about who she was and things in her past! I think I spanked Brooke once yeah I called her a couple couple of names, by no means ever treated her the way she's painting it.\nBrooke claims arguments with her parents would frequently turn physical during her childhood\n'They had cell phones. She could've posted horrible things about me back when all of this was supposedly happening, but she didn't because nothing was happening, but when she took her dad's side after the divorce and wrote the wonderful Mom song, and went to all the tabloids because Terry was using her as a tool.. her memory is completely skewed about the treatment that she received growing up in our household, and you can talk to anyone.\n'You can ask anybody you can ask Terry .. that none of the stuff ever happened. It's her angle to keep her family away from her now, revealing who she used to be after drinking a half a bottle of vodka. She was so drunk she broke my collarbone and cut my lip and insisted everyone take her to the hospital because she was poisoned and she wasn't. She was just drunk... there's many stories like that.\n'I'm not gonna go on, but I'm not gonna defend myself against these ridiculous allegations. I'll do that in court if she keeps it up.'\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Hulk Hogan for comment."
