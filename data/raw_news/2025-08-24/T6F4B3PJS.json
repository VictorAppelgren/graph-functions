      "text": "What are the top 10 Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots in Wisconsin history?\nOver the years, a few lucky lottery players have won eight and nine-figure Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots in Wisconsin.\nThe winners range from a group of employees at a well-known Wisconsin cheese company to a man from a prominent small-town family, who was later convicted of serious crimes.\nHere are the top 10 largest Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots in Wisconsin Lottery history:\nA $768.4 million lottery ticket was sold at a Speedway in New Berlin\n- Powerball, March 27, 2019\nAccording to the Wisconsin Lottery, this was the third-largest U.S. lottery jackpot ever at the time. Miguel Franco of West Allis, then 24, was identified as the winner and received a lump sum payout of $477 million.\nWhen Franco revealed himself as the winner in April 2019, he spoke about wanting to help the world once he got his affairs in order, the Journal Sentinel reported. That May, he donated a $200 Target gift card to a stranger, Nicole Domitro, a mother shopping for Pull-Ups for her son at an Illinois Target. Franco previously worked at a Milwaukee Target before moving to Illinois after winning the lottery.\nAn Oneida couple won $316.3 million from a ticket purchased at a Citgo in Ashwaubenon\n- Powerball, Jan. 5, 2022\nAccording to the Wisconsin Lottery, Tammy and Cliff Webster, a married couple from Oneida, split a $632.6 million jackpot with another winner who purchased their ticket in California. Powerball lists this as the ninth-largest jackpot in its history.\nThe Websters opted for a $225.1 million cash payout, which totaled $153.9 million in take-home pay after federal and state taxes. The couple are members of the Oneida Nation, and Cliff previously worked for the tribe's security department.\nA group of Sargento Food employees won $208.6 million off a ticket bought in Fond du Lac\n- Powerball, Aug. 5, 2006\n- Ma and Pa\u2019s Grocery Express, Fond du Lac\nA group of coworkers at Sargento Foods Incorporated in Plymouth who called themselves the \"100 Miracles\" won the prize. The 100 coworkers were the largest group to share in a jackpot prize at the time and split the winnings equally.\nNBC News reported that the coworkers, who usually pooled their money for the lottery when the jackpot was over $100 million, had been trying to win for three years. They'd even put a Buddha statue in a worker's locker, which workers would rub for good luck.\nMost of the workers opted for a lump sum payout, which totaled between $660,000 and $670,000 after taxes.\nA man and woman from Illinois won $195 million off a ticket purchased in Pell Lake\n- Powerball, May 20, 1998\n- Lakeside Country Store, Pell Lake\nCBS News reported on the win when it occurred.

The winner, Adrian Tongson of Racine, took home a $95.4 million cash payout. According to Journal Sentinel reporting, Tongson is the only person to have ever won a Mega Millions jackpot in Wisconsin.\nFollowing his win, Tongson told Mega Millions he was a regular Mega Millions player and hadn't realized he'd won the jackpot until checking his ticket weeks after the drawing. Tongson quit his job after the win.\nA Fond du Lac teacher won $111 million from a ticket bought along the city's 'Miracle Mile'\n- Powerball, July 7, 1993\n- Sentry Foods, Fond Du Lac\nAccording to the Wisconsin Lottery, the jackpot win \u2015 the largest Powerball jackpot to date at the time \u2015 began the reputation of Fond Du Lac's \"Miracle Mile,\" a stretch of Fond Du Lac convenience stores and supermarkets that have sold winning lottery tickets. Fond du Lac junior high teacher Les Robins won the record-setting jackpot.\nAfter leaving his teaching job, Robins opened Camp Winnegator, a children's summer day camp in Malone on Lake Winnebago, complete with horseback-riding stables, a gym, a pool and a mini golf course.

Robins had been running an errand for her when he purchased his winning ticket. They had still been together at the time.\nAn unknown buyer purchased a winning $40.7 million Powerball ticket in 2007\n- Powerball, March 31, 2007\nAccording to Powerball, the name of the winner, who purchased their ticket in Wisconsin, has remained withheld.\nA Thiensville man won $36.8 million on a ticket he bought locally\n- Powerball, Jan. 8, 2005\n- Thiensville Mobil Mart, Thiensville\nAccording to Powerball, Peter Bapes of Thiensville was named as the jackpot winner.\nA Wisconsin man who won $31.4 million was later convicted of stalking and obsessing over a teenage girl\n- Powerball, Oct. 14, 2009\n- City Limits BP, Marinette\nDouglas P.

The Journal Sentinel reported that Miron purchased multiple new vehicles, a house with an airstrip and other real estate with his winnings.\nHe also \"financed some friends' small businesses. He bought a bar and pizza place he named Giachino's and hired friends to work there, but it didn't last long without professional management,\" Journal Sentinel reporter Bruce Vielmetti wrote in 2015.\nHowever, Miron was later charged with nine felonies, including stalking, and one misdemeanor related to his obsessive behavior toward a teenage girl he'd hired to clean the house he purchased with his lottery winnings.

      "text": "West Allis man wins $768 million Powerball jackpot, had a 'lucky feeling' after he purchased ticket\nMADISON - Manuel Franco said he \"felt lucky\" after work on March 27.\nFranco stopped at the Speedway gas station in New Berlin and bought $10 worth of Powerball tickets like he had many times before, letting the machine pick his numbers. One of those tickets was the single $768.4 million Powerball jackpot winner.\nThe 24-year-old from West Allis claimed his winnings Tuesday at the state lottery headquarters in Madison. The prize is the largest jackpot in the Wisconsin Lottery's history and the third-largest lottery prize in U.S. history.\nFranco was feeling so lucky that spring afternoon, he looked at the security camera and almost winked, he said. But the next day, he woke up and went to work, Franco said. He saw news reports that the winner was in Wisconsin and thought it could be a good sign.\nHe checked his tickets. First, he checked tickets purchased with his girlfriend \u2014 no winners. Then he started checking the tickets he bought on his own at the Speedway. Franco said he was excited when the third one won $4. Franco said he didn't claim it once he saw that the last ticket he checked matched perfectly.\n\"My heart started racing,\" Franco said. He screamed.\n\"I wasn't ready for it,\" he said. He went to work again the next day.\n\"The second day of work after I knew I won, I honestly couldn\u2019t work I was sweating so much that I\u2019m sure everyone at work noticed,\" Franco said. \"I really wanted to say something to anybody there, but I knew that was a bad decision and I pretty much never showed up for work again.\"\nHis financial worry up until this point: \"Trying to get that bank account to $1,000 was my biggest concern,\" Franco said.\nFranco said he's played Powerball routinely since he turned 18.\nFranco said he has been assembling a team of advisers to guide him through the sudden riches since the March drawing. Franco said he's taking the $477 million lump sum payout. The money \u2014 $326 million after state and federal taxes \u2014 will be wire transferred to Franco in the coming days, Wisconsin Lottery officials said.\n\"I simply cannot believe that an ordinary guy like me could win,\" he said.\nFranco said his mom initially thought he was in trouble when he told her about the winnings. His dad cried, Franco said.\nFranco, per the advice of his attorney, did not disclose personal details like where he worked or went to school.\nHis plans after the news conference were to \"take off somewhere.\"\nFranco said he wants to take his time before making any big decisions about what he'll do with his millions.\n\"Right now, what I do know is that I want to take a break, let it sink in and make sure I\u2019m not making any bad decisions,\" he said. \"I do want to help out the world but I have to do it correctly and I have to make sure my future is secure.\"\nThis is the 17th Powerball jackpot win in Wisconsin since 1988. The largest award in Wisconsin before this Powerball drawing came in 2006 when a group of 100 people in Fond du Lac won $208.8 million.\nThe only jackpots larger than Wednesday's include the world record $1.586 billion Powerball jackpot in January 2016 shared by winners in California, Colorado and Tennessee. A woman from South Carolina anonymously claimed the second biggest prize of a $1.537 billion Mega Millions jackpot last October.\nSarah Hauer can be reached at shauer@journalsentinel.com or on Instagram @HauerSarah and Twitter @SarahHauer.
