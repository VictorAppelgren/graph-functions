  "description": "Securing data centers against evolving OT and IoT threats",
  "content": "The UK government's designation of data centers as Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) underscores their vital role in national operations and economic stability. This recognition comes with increased scrutiny and highlights the need for robust cybersecurity, especially in the face of escalating global threats.\n\nWhile significant investment is pouring into the UK data center sector, a critical question remains: how much of this addresses the often-overlooked cybersecurity risks associated with Operational Technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices?\n\nData center operators have traditionally prioritized IT security, safeguarding valuable data from cyber threats by focusing on data center connectivity and server infrastructure. However, critical OT systems responsible for building automation, cooling, power, safety, and physical security often lack the same level of protection and are often not accounted for at all.\n\nThese systems, crucial for maintaining the physical functionality of data centers, become interesting targets for attackers if left unsecured, often being used as initial points of access and presence in Data Centre networks. This risk is underscored by the fact that many of these systems are more connected to data center networks and even the internet than security teams realize, while often lacking basic cyber security hygiene like operating system updates, secure credentials, and network monitoring.\n\nSimilarly, IoT devices like IP cameras, digital displays, fire suppression systems, and biometric access controls, while enhancing safety and physical security, introduce a complicated additional attack vector for security team to account for. Like OT systems, these devices often use stripped down, embedded operating systems that lack critical cyber security functions making them a relatively easy target for compromise.\n\nThere are now numerous known public examples of OT/IoT vulnerabilities being exploited in data centers and similar environments, and likely many more compromises that are not disclosed or even remain undetected. IP cameras have been hijacked for botnet attacks, launching large-scale DDoS attacks. Building management systems have been compromised for unauthorized activities like crypto mining, impacting system stability and risking failure with dangerous levels of resource utilization.\n\nEven when not targeted for direct impact, OT and IoT devices are often \u2018soft\u2019 targets threat actors can use for sustained presence in even otherwise secure networks that have invested heavily in IT cyber security. These incidents highlight the very real dangers of neglecting OT/IoT security. Ignoring these vulnerabilities is like leaving the keys to your data center under the welcome mat.\n\nBridging the Gap: A Focus on OT/IoT Visibility and Security\n\nEffectively securing OT/IoT environments requires a different approach than traditional IT security. It starts with gaining complete visibility into these often-forgotten systems. Data center operators need to know what devices are connected, how they communicate, and what vulnerabilities they introduce.\n\nThis requires specialized tools designed for OT/IoT environments, capable of identifying and profiling industrial control systems, building and IT automation devices, and other connected assets. This likely also requires monitoring wireless communications as well, as many IoT devices are connected via site WiFi networks or IoT connectivity solutions like LoRa or cellular.\n\nOnce visibility is established, continuous monitoring and threat detection are crucial. Real-time asset management allows operators to track every connected device, identifying unauthorized or anomalous behavior before it escalates into a major incident.\n\nThis includes monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity and implementing anomaly detection systems tailored to OT and IoT protocols. Something as simple as identifying an IoT device like a camera attempting to communicate with the data center server infrastructure could be indicative of a compromised device.\n\nWhile the responsibility for securing data centers ultimately rests with the operators, collaboration between the government and the private sector is still essential. Government initiatives like the NCSC's Active Cyber Defence (ACD) program provide valuable resources for threat identification and response. And, industry collaboration and threat intelligence sharing, as advocated by the World Economic Forum, are crucial for staying ahead of sophisticated attackers.\n\u2022 Asset discovery and inventory: Identify and document every connected OT and IoT device within the data center environment.\n\u2022 Vulnerability assessment: Assess the security posture of OT/IoT devices and systems, identifying potential weaknesses.\n\u2022 Network segmentation: Implement micro-segmentation to isolate critical OT systems and limit the impact of potential breaches.\n\nThe Time to Act is Now: Don't Wait for a Breach to Wake You Up\n\nAs data centers become increasingly complex and interconnected, a holistic approach to cybersecurity, encompassing all of IT, OT, and IoT, is no longer optional \u2013 it's a necessity. Don't wait for a breach to expose the vulnerabilities in your OT/IoT infrastructure.\n\nBy taking simple, proactive steps, data center operators can significantly reduce their cyber risk and ensure the resilience of these critical facilities. Protecting your data is crucial, but protecting the systems that support your data is equally important. Ensuring that cyber security investment goes beyond IT and accounts for OT and IoT environments is critical to secure the foundation of your data center operations.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Securing the future: why cybersecurity must be secure by design \u2013 and by default\nEvolving threats demand proactive, continuous defense\nThe UK Public Accounts Committee\u2019s recent report sends a clear and urgent message: cyber threats are evolving faster than defenses can keep up. The digital infrastructure underpinning our critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed\u2014not only due to external threats but because of internal gaps in strategy, capability, and legacy system management.\nReplacing outdated technology may be part of the solution, but it\u2019s far from the full picture. We need a fundamental shift in mindset\u2014toward continuous assurance, smarter system design, and a dynamic approach to skills development that anticipates the challenges of tomorrow, not just today.\nStrategic Marketing Director Digital Identity at Thales.\nBeyond \u2018build and forget\u2019: cybersecurity as an ongoing commitment\nFor too long, cybersecurity has followed a static, compliance-driven model\u2014deploy once, tick the box, and move on. In today\u2019s evolving threat landscape, this \u2018build and forget\u2019 mentality is no longer viable, if it ever was.\nSecurity must be woven into every stage of design, development, and operations through a Secure by Design approach. With Cyber Physical Systems and enterprise IT environments in constant flux, reassessing security posture regularly ensures defenses remain adaptive and effective.\nThe UK government has rightly prioritized Secure by Design in its Defending the UK in a Digital World: Cyber Security Strategy 2022\u201325. Yet, despite this ambition, adoption across sectors remains uneven, with many organizations still relying on outdated risk frameworks and reactive measures\u2014essentially attempting to counter modern threats with legacy solutions.\nCybersecurity must evolve beyond static processes. It requires continuous evaluation, proactive defense, and resilient security strategies to stay ahead of emerging risks.\nLegacy systems: balancing risk and progress\nFew areas illustrate the tension between innovation and practicality more clearly than legacy systems. Originally built for a different technological landscape, many were air-gapped, manually operated, and completely isolated from external networks\u2014never designed to withstand the level of connectivity and cyber threats seen today.\nIn pursuit of efficiency and cost reduction, organizations have increasingly networked and remotely managed these systems, often without implementing adequate security safeguards. While this enhances operational flexibility, it also exposes critical infrastructure to new vulnerabilities, opening doors to sophisticated cyber threats.\nThe solution isn't as simple as replacing old systems outright. The decision to upgrade or extend the life of legacy platforms requires careful cyber risk evaluation, ensuring the right balance of mitigation strategies, isolation measures, and continuous monitoring to maintain security. Organizations must also weigh financial constraints, applying appropriate risk controls to optimize security investments without excessive costs.\nSecure by design: a strategic imperative\nSecure by Design isn\u2019t just a cybersecurity buzzword\u2014it\u2019s an essential principle for building resilient digital infrastructure. It ensures that an appropriate level of security is built in from the ground up, integrated at every design, development, and operational phase to create adaptable, auditable, and testable systems.\nYet, despite its inclusion in policy frameworks and industry guidelines, implementation is often incomplete or superficial. Many organizations pay lip service to security but fail to embed it across teams and processes, treating it as an isolated function rather than an organizational priority \u2013 much like organizations approach health and safety.\nRegulation will play a vital role in closing this gap. The upcoming Cyber Security and Resilience Bill is set to improve oversight, enforce stronger standards, and introduce mandatory incident reporting for high-risk sectors. Coupled with enhanced threat intelligence sharing, this legislation could shift cybersecurity strategies from reactive defense to proactive resilience.\nCyber talent: securing the future workforce\nAnother major challenge in cybersecurity is building a workforce capable of responding to evolving threats. As technology advances, skills become obsolete faster than ever, requiring ongoing investment in cyber capability development.\nWhile direct government hiring plays a role\u2014especially in sensitive security domains\u2014industry partnerships offer a scalable alternative. Specialist organizations, like Thales, are well-positioned to train and upskill professionals through apprenticeships, immersive simulations, and diverse sector exposure, which traditional public-sector roles often lack.\nThis model provides dual benefits: it equips trainees with experience across various threat scenarios, while also fostering an agile workforce that can quickly adapt to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Cybersecurity isn't just about fixing vulnerabilities of the past\u2014it's about anticipating and securing against the threats of the future.\nTransparency and collaboration: strengthening cyber resilience\nCybersecurity can no longer be viewed as a standalone issue\u2014threats don\u2019t respect organizational boundaries, and weaknesses in one system can expose an entire network. Transparency, collaboration, and mandatory incident reporting are essential for national security, ensuring vulnerabilities are addressed before they escalate into widespread risks.\nReporting cyber incidents, much like the practice of reporting near misses and accidents in health and safety, strengthens overall resilience. Just as greater visibility has helped organizations reduce safety incidents, increased cyber reporting makes it harder for hackers to exploit gaps, reinforcing defenses before real damage occurs.\nThe Thales Data Threat Report underscores the growing risks to Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) and highlights the value of compliance\u2014organisations that passed cybersecurity audits had significantly fewer breaches than those that failed. With the Cyber Security and Resilience Bill raising standards, stronger protections for essential infrastructure, including data centers that support AI innovation and national healthcare, will become the norm.\nEach unreported cyber-attack is a missed opportunity to refine security strategies. Enhanced visibility into cyber threats improves collective intelligence, allowing organizations to make faster, smarter decisions in the face of emerging risks.\nConclusion: building security for the future\nModern cybersecurity requires more than patching vulnerabilities or checking compliance boxes\u2014it demands a strategic rethink of how systems are designed, maintained, and safeguarded. Understanding how legacy and modern environments interact is key, alongside developing cyber talent that can anticipate and mitigate future risks.\nSecure by Design must be the standard, not the exception. With the right balance of policy, proactive security measures, and skilled professionals, organizations can shift from reactive defense to sustainable resilience, ensuring they are prepared for the threats ahead, not just responding to the ones they see today.\nWe've featured the best endpoint protection software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "It\u2019s a scenario that plays out far too often: A mid-sized company runs a routine threat validation exercise and stumbles on something unexpected, like an old infostealer variant that has been quietly active in their network for weeks.\nThis scenario doesn\u2019t require a zero-day exploit or sophisticated malware. All it takes is one missed setting, inadequate endpoint oversight, or a user clicking what they shouldn\u2019t. Such attacks don\u2019t succeed because they\u2019re advanced. They succeed because routine safeguards aren\u2019t in place.\nTake Lumma Stealer, for example. This is a simple phishing attack that lures users into running a fake CAPTCHA script. It spreads quickly but can be stopped cold by something as routine as restricting PowerShell access and providing basic user training. However, in many environments, even those basic defenses aren\u2019t deployed.\nThis is the story behind many breaches today. Not headline-grabbing hacks or futuristic AI assaults\u2014just overlooked updates, fatigued teams and basic cyber hygiene falling through the cracks.\nVP of Adversary Research, Attackiq.\nSecurity Gaps That Shouldn\u2019t Exist in 2025\nSecurity leaders know the drill: patch the systems, limit access and train employees. Yet these essentials often get neglected. While the industry chases the latest exploits and talks up advanced tools, attackers keep targeting the same weak points. They don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel. They just need to find one that\u2019s loose.\nJust as the same old techniques are still at work, old malware is making a comeback. Variants like Mirai, Matsu and Klopp are resurfacing with minor updates and major impact. These aren\u2019t sophisticated campaigns, but recycled attacks retooled just enough to slip past tired defenses.\nThe reason they work isn\u2019t technical, it\u2019s operational. Security teams are burned out. They\u2019re managing too many alerts, juggling too many tools and doing it all with shrinking budgets and rising expectations. In this kind of environment, the basics don\u2019t just get deprioritized, they get lost.\nBurnout Is a Risk Factor\nThe cybersecurity industry often defines risk in terms of vulnerabilities, threat actors and tool coverage, but burnout may be the most overlooked risk of all. When analysts are overwhelmed, they miss routine maintenance. When processes are brittle, teams can\u2019t keep up with the volume. When bandwidth runs out, even critical tasks can get sidelined.\nThis isn\u2019t about laziness. It\u2019s about capacity. Most breaches don\u2019t reveal a lack of intelligence. They just demonstrate a lack of time.\nMeanwhile, phishing campaigns are growing more sophisticated. Generative AI is making it easier for attackers to craft personalized lures. Infostealers continue to evolve, disguising themselves as login portals or trusted interfaces that lure users into running malicious code. Users often infect themselves, unknowingly handing over credentials or executing code.\nThese attacks still rely on the same assumptions: someone will click. The system will let it run. And no one will notice until it\u2019s too late.\nWhy Real-World Readiness Matters More Than Tools\nIt\u2019s easy to think readiness means buying new software or hiring a red team, but true preparedness is quieter and more disciplined. It\u2019s about confirming that defenses such as access restrictions, endpoint rules and user permissions are working against the actual threats.\nAchieving this level of preparedness takes more than monitoring generic threat feeds. Knowing that ransomware is trending globally isn\u2019t the same as knowing which threat groups are actively scanning your infrastructure. That\u2019s the difference between a broader weather forecast and radar focused on your ZIP code.\nOrganizations that regularly validate controls against real-world, environment-specific threats gain three key advantages.\nFirst, they catch problems early. Second, they build confidence across their team. When everyone knows what to expect and how to respond, fatigue gives way to clarity. Thirdly, by knowing the threats that matter, and the ones focused on them, they can prioritize those fundamental activities that get ignored.\nYou may not need to patch every CVE right now, just the ones being used by the threat actors targeting you. What areas of your network are they actively doing reconnaissance on? Those subnets probably need more focus to patching and remediation.\nSecurity Doesn\u2019t Need to Be Sexy, It Needs to Work\nThere\u2019s a cultural bias in cybersecurity toward innovation and incident response. The new tool, the emergency patch and the major breach all get more attention than the daily habits that quietly prevent problems.\nReal resilience depends on consistency. It means users can\u2019t run untrusted PowerShell scripts. It means patches are applied on a prioritized schedule, not \u201cwhen we get around to it.\u201d It means phishing training isn\u2019t just a checkbox, but a habit reinforced over time.\nThese basics aren\u2019t glamorous, but they work. In an environment where attackers are looking for the easiest way in, doing the simplest things correctly is one of the most effective strategies a team can take.\nDiscipline Is the New Innovation\nThe cybersecurity landscape will continue to change. AI will keep evolving, adversaries will go on adapting, and the next headline breach is likely already in motion. The best defense isn\u2019t more noise or more tech, but better discipline.\nSecurity teams don\u2019t need to do everything. They need to do the right things consistently. That starts with reestablishing routine discipline: patch, configure, test, rinse and repeat. When those fundamentals are strong, the rest can hold.\nFor CISOs, now is the time to ask a simple but powerful question: Are we doing the basics well, and can we prove it? Start by assessing your organization\u2019s hygiene baseline. What patches are overdue? What controls haven\u2019t been tested in months? Where are your people stretched too thin to execute the essentials? The answers won\u2019t just highlight the risks, they\u2019ll point toward the pathway to resilience.\nWe list the best patch management software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Flexera\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFlexera is an advanced IT management platform. It\u2019s not as popular as other competitors on this list but is nonetheless a very good tool.

However, we observed customer complaints about the platform\u2019s performance slowing down when working with a large number of records.\nWe've also featured the best asset management software.\nBest software asset management tool FAQs\nEssential features of a software asset management tool\nSoftware discovery\nYour platform should keep a centralized database of all the software resources that your organization uses. In the old times, companies used spreadsheets to track this, a process that was prone to mistakes. Software asset management platforms have made it easier by automatically detecting all the software registered on a company\u2019s network.\nAccess control\nYou should be able to control who has access to what software or not. Business software often contains very sensitive information, which makes security paramount. Hence, your platform should let you decide who can access software with such sensitive information.\nAutomated license tracking\nUsing many software assets means that you must keep accurate track of license expiry and renewal dates. Doing this manually is prone to mistakes that can disrupt your operations if a subscription is allowed to lapse. However, asset management tools automate the license tracking process and always alert you when the renewal date is near.\nReporting\nYou should be able to generate automatic, detailed reports about your organization\u2019s software use. These reports should look professional and presentable at a glance. They should also contain accurate information.\nHow to choose a software asset management tool\nCost\nCost is the first thing to consider when choosing any platform. You should pick a software asset management tool that you can afford in the long term. Pricing usually depends on your organization\u2019s size and technical infrastructure. Ensure you get a good estimate of what you\u2019ll pay beforehand and read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs. Check if there\u2019s a free trial to test the features before paying.\nEase of use and setup\nSetting up a software asset management tool to integrate with your existing technical infrastructure is often difficult. Hence, you should find a platform that\u2019s as easy to set up as possible. The platform should also have an intuitive interface that\u2019s easy to navigate and understand. Any platform that\u2019s difficult to set up and use can frustrate your staff and cause costly mistakes.\nCustomer support\nSoftware glitches and problems can occur at any time, and you\u2019ll likely need external help to solve them. Thus, you should go for a software asset management tool that has a good reputation regarding customer support. You should be able to connect with a knowledgeable human support representative at any time. You should also have access to extra support resources such as FAQs, user guides, and detailed documentation.\nHow we tested the best software asset management tool\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service. We also analyze whether there are collaboration features for multiple users, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best online collaboration tool of 2025\nSoftware for teams\nWe list the best online collaboration software, to make it simple and easy for teams to work together.\nAlthough collaboration tools had already been set up for office teams, the pandemic and subsequent lock down that saw many people working remotely has lead to a resurgence in collaboration tool features. The result is that collaboration has become the new normal in the workplace.\nSince employees can no longer be expected to work from the same location, this means the ability for teams to share, use, and edit files at a distance has become essential for productivity.\nHowever, collaboration tools aren't simply limited to office software such as Microsoft docs and spreadsheets, but could be anything from using cloud document storage for managing daily tasks, to video conferencing for online meetings. Even better is that the best collaboration tools will work just as well on mobile devices as well as desktops and laptops.\nAbove all, everything should be clear, easy to understand, simply to use and reduce misunderstanding. Every employee should be empowered to be able to speak to the right person, wherever they are in the company, to address the same problem. And then solve that problem within an acceptable workflow.\nThe days of collaborative working are here, so below we list what we think are the best collaboration tools currently available.\nThe Future of Teamwork. Co-create in Real-Time with Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Start Your Google Workspace Free Trial. Save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe've also featured the best task management apps.\nThe best online collaboration tools of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest online collaboration tool for comms\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSlack is without doubt a mighty collaboration tool, with millions of users around the globe. It\u2019s an incredibly smart platform, and you can get it on mobile and desktop devices. It allows for the sending of direct messages (DMs) and files to a single person or a group of employees, and there\u2019s the ability to organize conversations into different channels (perhaps for specific projects, one for technical support, general chat, and so forth).\nThe app also supports video calling. You can use the feature to talk to your colleagues about projects and work in-depth, without having to type everything into a DM. While this isn\u2019t a replacement for cloud storage services, you are able to drag, drop and share files with your colleagues directly within Slack. It\u2019s also compatible with services such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Box.\nTo round things off, Slack even has a free version, although unsurprisingly it has limitations (in terms of the number of messages stored, overall storage space and so forth).\nRead our full Slack review.\nBest online collaboration tool overall\nReasons to buy\nMicrosoft Office may not be the first platform you think of when it comes to collaboration, but this now runs at the heart of the Microsoft 365 cloud-based office suite.\nThis is important because Microsoft Office remains the most used and therefore important office suite out there, and while there are competitors such as OpenOffice and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) they still haven't caught up to the same level of functionality and ease of use.\nTherefore as Microsoft Office is likely to be at the heart of many businesses, the move to Microsoft 365 offers a number of advantages, not least the ability for teams to collaborate directly on the same set of documents. This could be anything from work shifts in an Excel spreadsheet, to a presentation in PowerPoint, to client reports written in Word.\nAdded to this is that Microsoft Teams now comes bundled with a number of Microsoft 365 packages, allowing for Unified Communications integrated with the traditional office software.\nWhat makes Microsoft 365 more attractive is that as a cloud-hosted platform it can be used not just with Windows, but also Mac, Android, and iOS.\nOverall, Microsoft 365 doesn't simply offer a great office suite, but one that is also firmly designed for collaboration and sharing with teams.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nOur Microsoft discount codes can help you save on your next purchase.\nBest all-in-one online collaboration tool\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMiro is one of those online tools that aims to bridge the gap between traditional office working and the modern hybrid routine that many of us are familiar with. It is best described as a multipurpose online collaboration tool, and its list of features is pretty extensive stretching beyond the typical realms of similar software.\nThe majority of the work you\u2019ll end up doing in Miro will revolve around what it calls boards, which start off as entirely blank spaces. Setting one up from scratch can be daunting and time-consuming, which is why the company has designed templates that you can pick from the get-go.\nSome of its most commonly accessed templates include mind maps, Kanban boards, flowcharts, product roadmaps, and timelines. Many of these will serve well as project management tools, and anybody familiar with other project management software like Airtable or Trello will already be familiar with how they work.\nOverall, we think Miro is hard to beat. Its long list of features should cover all parts of a typical business process from research and design to presentation, and its collaboration abilities are second to none. Furthermore, its transparency around security and reasonable pricing make it hard for us not to recommend it. The only thing we could wish for is better support channels.\nRead our full Miro review.\nBest online collaboration tool for tracking\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAsana has been around since 2008, making it a veteran in the collaboration arena, and companies such as Intel, Uber, Pinterest and TED all use it as their core method of communication.\nIt\u2019s been designed as an easy way for companies to track the work of employees and to get the best possible results. Using the platform, you can create to-do lists for ongoing projects, set reminders for upcoming deadlines and send requests to colleagues. Team members can also assign comments to posts within the app.\nYou can organize all your projects in a list or board format, and there\u2019s a search function so you can locate past work quickly. In short, Asana is a very effective way to stay super-organized and facilitate conversations when it comes to updates on how work is progressing.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest online collaboration tool for organizing\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have ever looked into project management software and online collaboration tools, then no doubt you\u2019ve come across Trello. Available on the web and with mobile apps, it lets you easily organize projects and work on them with colleagues.\nThe platform allows you to work with boards or lists, which can be organized by teams and different tasks. And within these, you can set up to-do lists and delegate amongst colleagues. There\u2019s also the option to assign comments to cards \u2013 a quick way to give feedback to others.\nFurthermore, Trello boasts a number of integrations with apps such as Evernote, GitHub, Google Drive and Slack. You can download the app for free, but there are premium options available which give access to more features.\nThe Premium pricing tier unlocks a number of additional administrative features for better organization. There's also an Enterprise edition which is priced according to the number of users required, and provides some additional organizational management features.\nRead our full Trello review.\nBest online collaboration tool space\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGoogle Workspace (formerly called G Suite) is Google's answer to Microsoft 365, and more. This is one of the best platforms you can choose for an organization because it comes with a lot of features.\nThink of this software as the enterprise version of all the popular Google tools you use. For instance, you can create custom business emails for staff that uses the same interface as the popular Gmail app. People can create and edit documents collaboratively on Google Docs; you\u2019ll see any changes in real time, and anyone is free to make comments and suggestions for any changes.\nThere's Meet, a video-conferencing solution for enterprises; this tool for valuable for colleagues to stay in touch with each other, especially for remote companies. There\u2019s also Google Chat, a messaging tool for enterprises; Google Drive for file sharing; Google Sheets for spreadsheets; and a shared calendar tool that enables colleagues to keep tabs on each other\u2019s schedules. These tools are what you\u2019ll get access to as a Google Workspace subscriber.\nA Starter plan includes 30GB storage per user and a maximum of 100 participants in video meetings. The Standard plan includes 2TB of storage and up to 150 participants in video meetings. The Plus plan includes 5TB of storage per user and up to 500 participants in video meetings. There's also an Enterprise plan that offers as much storage and video meeting participants as you need; this plan has no standard pricing, so you'll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nYou can save on your Google Workspace subscription with our Google Workspace promo codes.\nRead our full Google Workspace review.\nBest online collaboration tool for mobile\nReasons to buy\nPodio describes itself as a flexible and customizable online platform for work and communication among teams. In other words, it gives you a way to organize large stacks of work and to delegate tasks between employees.\nJust like many of the other business collaboration apps out there, Podio provides you with the tools to share files, view the status of ongoing projects and get feedback on the things you\u2019re currently working on. These functionalities are combined into an easy-to-use interface.\nPodio is also equipped with quality mobile apps for when you\u2019re out and about, and need to use your smartphone or tablet, and it has an impressive amount of integration with third-party services and apps including Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote and Zendesk.\nRead our full Podio review.\nBest online collaboration tool for ease-of-use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRyver is similar to Slack, aiming to give your organization a highly effective means of communication, and an easy way to talk over tasks, ensuring that deadlines are met.\nWhat makes Ryver a compelling option is the fact that you can create as many teams as you want within the app, and easily categorize them to boot. As is the case with Slack, you can use the platform to set up chats with groups and individuals.\nThere are some interesting filters, too. You can control who sees the things you say and post in the app, and obviously enough, join the teams that are most relevant to you. All company posts are located within a Facebook-style newsfeed, and you can mark posts to come back to them later on.\nThere\u2019s also a host of native clients across mobile and desktop, including Mac and Linux. There's also a premium version for enterprise which offers workflow automation, Single Sign-On (SSO), and advanced team management.\nRead our full Ryver review.\nBest online collaboration platform\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAirtable is a platform that supports extensive online collaboration and project management. You can use it to share data seamlessly within an organization for people to collaborate. This platform has extensive third-party integration, so you can sync data from other apps and ensure it is always up-to-date.\nAirtable is not just a standalone collaborative tool. It is actually a platform on which people can build collaborative apps. It touts itself as \u201clow-code\u201d, meaning you don\u2019t need sophisticated programming skills to build apps on it, although a little will help. Anyone in your organization can build an app on Airtable to foster collaboration.\nYou can start with the free plan, which has limitations on the file sizes and the number of collaborators. Thus, you\u2019ll need a paid plan to maximize your use of this platform, and you can choose from one of three such plans; Plus, Pro, and Enterprise.\nThe Plus plan supports an unlimited number of users. The limitation is that you'll get a maximum of 5GB space per base (which refers to a project) and a maximum of 5,000 records for each base. The Pro plan increases the storage space to 20GB per base with a maximum of 50,000 records for each base. The Enterprise plan is the highest, giving you up to 1TB of space per base and 100,000 records; this plan has no standard pricing, so you\u2019ll have to contact the sales team for a quote.\nRead our full Airtable review.\nBest online collaboration tool for designers\n10. InVision\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInVision is a collaborative tool built for designers. It provides a virtual whiteboard where multiple collaborators can share their design ideas and thoughts to come up with solutions. This whiteboard allows real-time interaction so that teams within an organization can brainstorm about work-related activities.\nThe whiteboard is called Freehand, owing its name to the fact people usually use their hands to write on whiteboards. In this case, the board is virtual, and you are free to write text while discussing with your team about a work project. You can also add images, photos, videos, etc., to provide context for your ideas.\nSometimes, you\u2019ll need templates to explain an idea to your teammates, e.g., flowcharts and interactive widgets. The good thing is that InVision provides over 200 pre-built templates that you can use for this.\nThe Freehand tool also has direct integrations with a lot of third-party software. For example, you can open a video chat by connecting to Zoom or Webex or turn your whiteboard ideas directly into tasks on Jira and Asana. If you wish, you can import your existing whiteboards from other collaborative apps, e.g., Miro.\nThis platform was built mainly for designers but is not exclusive to them. It is also suitable for product teams, human resource (HR) teams, marketing teams, etc.\nOther collaborative software to consider\nThere are many other collaboration tools worth your attention, if nothing else because of the way they apply features differently, or even add other useful features. Here we'll look at some additional online collaboration tools that could be worth exploring further:\nVisme is developed specifically for collaborative online reports, presentations, and infographics. Aside from promoting branding support and aiming to reduce design costs, analytics are provided so you can see which presentations and reports result in the most engagement, and adjust accordingly. Visme recommends itself for sales and marketing, HR and recruiting, internal communications, as well as education and in-house training. The software is specifically priced around individual, business, or education use.\nBasecamp aims to be an all-in-one collaboration and communications platform, to bring features of multiple software offerings into a single place so that it's easier to sort through information, and, of course, keep it all in one easy to manage place. Features include chat, messageboards, to-do lists and scheduling as well as automated check-in, as well as a single place to store all documents, files, and folders. Unlike other collaborative software that charges per user, Basecamp charges a single fee of $99.99 for unlimited users, which could make it especially attractive to larger organizations.\nWrike is more of a project management and scheduling tool, that makes it easy to see where everyone is in terms of completing a project. As a standalone it might seem quite limited compared to some of the others here, but its strength lies in its extensive range of integrations, which includes Google, Dropbox, Salesforce, Microsoft, Adobe, and Github. This means Wrike can work as a central platform tied to a number of others software apps, allowing you to cover a wider range of options and features than some standalone software options.\nMonday.com is a platform that allows you to plan, track, and collaborate on projects in a visually simple manner. Drag-and-drop functionality and ease of use make this a particularly good platform for project management and general workflow management among teams. It also integrates with Slack, Trello, Google Drive, Dropbox, and others, so you can use it a central focal point for teams to work together. As above, these integrations mean that monday.com can be used to achieve a wider working remit than the standalone platform itself.\nWe've also featured the best small business software.\nBest online collaboration tool FAQs\nTips for choosing a suitable online collaboration tool\n1. Consider your budget and look for something that\u2019s affordable for your enterprise. If you\u2019re a large organization with a sizeable IT budget, you can go with a more expensive platform that\u2019ll give you access to sophisticated features that you may not even need much. In contrast, if you\u2019re a small business, it\u2019s wise to choose a plan that gives you just the basic collaboration features at a reasonable price.\n2. Customer support. Things can go wrong at any time, so choose a platform that offers customer support via email, live chat, or telephone. Check user reviews to see what other people are saying about your intended platform\u2019s support before making a final choice.\n3. Look for a platform with a user-friendly interface. This will make it easy for employees of your organization to collaborate instead of losing productivity trying to figure out how to use the software.\n4. Choose a platform with a strong security reputation to avoid leaks or theft of sensitive data.\n5. Pick a platform that has integrations with third-party tools for additional functionalities that you may need.\nWhich online collaboration tools is best for you?\nWhen deciding which online collaboration tool to use, first consider what actual needs you have. For example, someone simply wanting to work with a handful of people on a casual basis may find a cheaper option is the most cost-effective while providing all of the necessary tools that would be required. However, if you're planning to use online collaboration tools for professional or business purposes, especially with a large number of people and on a regular basis, then you will probably want to look to the higher-end options for the more advanced options that are included.\nHow we tested the best online collaboration tools\nTo test for the best online collaboration tools we searched for a range of popular options as well as took recommendations from people we know who use online collaboration tools regularly. We then tried each platform to see how user-friendly each was, as well as determine what range of tools and advanced options were available. Pricing also came into account when determining our best list.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

This platform scales well without sacrificing performance and has an intuitive interface that is easy to understand.\nPricing starts at $0.04 per hour per network host, which is quite expensive. The platform also has a steep learning curve due to having numerous features.\nBest network monitoring tool for hybrid clouds\n5. Intermapper\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIntermapper is a good network monitoring software. As the name suggests, it gives enterprises a network map that offers a live view into their network. IT administrators can monitor every aspect of their network from this map, and there are a variety of layout options to select. The map has color-coded statuses to show what networks are up and which ones are down.\nIf you spot any issues on your network via Intermapper, the software can troubleshoot it to identify the root costs and save your IT team time and efforts. With Intermapper, you can automatically discover every device connected to your network and know if there's any unauthorized one lurking somewhere. You can manage the network from your dashboard and generate analytics and reports to show superiors.\nIntermapper has native integrations with AWS to extract performance data from the cloud provider. You just need to add your AWS EC2 instances, and you can start tracking performance metrics.\nThere\u2019s no standard pricing for Intermapper. You\u2019ll have to contact the company\u2019s sales team for a custom quote.\nWe've also listed the best network switch.\nBest network monitoring tool FAQs\nFeatures of a network monitoring tool\n1. Automated discovery\nYour network monitoring tool should automatically seek out threats or anomalies in your network and alert you immediately to anyone it detects. The good thing is that many tools now employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to spot such threats more easily. Automated reporting will help IT administrators respond more swiftly to fix issues.\n2. Device monitoring\nYou should be able to monitor the performance of every device connected to your network. Watch out for issues such as power outages, database crashes, router failures, etc. If you observe a flaw with a specific device, you should be able to troubleshoot it and identify the issue to fix it.\nYour platform should have network maps giving administrators a bird\u2019s eye view of the network. This network map is double important for large enterprises with a massive number of devices connected to their network.\nConstant monitoring will help you prevent issues that can cause a widespread network collapse.\n3. Scalability\nYour network monitoring tool should scale without sacrificing performance. It should be able to handle increasing monitoring needs as you add more devices to your network. Any network monitoring tool that can\u2019t scale well isn\u2019t a good one.\nHow to choose a network monitoring tool\n1. Cost\nCost is the main consideration when choosing any software. It\u2019s essential to choose a platform that you can afford in the long term. Check if there\u2019s a free trial and use it to test the platform\u2019s features before making your final purchase decision.\nThe pricing for network monitoring tools is often not straightforward. There are many variations and the final bill depends on the size of your network. Hence, always read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs.\n2. Ease of use and setup\nYour network monitoring tool should be easy to set up and configure. It should be easy to navigate or else will frustrate your IT administrators and probably lead to costly mistakes. It should also be easy to customize to fit your needs.\n3. Customer support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you\u2019ll likely need external help to sort out the issue. You should be able to contact a human support representative via live chat, email, or telephone depending on the urgency of the issue. Your platform should also offer complementary support resources such as video tutorials, user guides, and extensive documentation covering all features.\nMore on network monitoring\nThe best network monitoring tools make it simpler and easier to manage all aspects of remote monitoring of your IT infrastructure.\nThis is important because IT is now at the heart of any given business, and applies to every department, every section, and every employee. Yet the larger the business, the more difficult it can be to monitor and maintain the network infrastructure, and keep it monitored for security threats.\nThis means that remote networking monitoring tools, sometimes referred to as RMM (Remote Monitoring Management), have become an essential part of securing and keeping IT networks safe.\nIt's not even just external threats such as malware and ransomware that need to be guarded against, but more mundane issues such as maintaining security protocols and ensuring network connectivity in the face of upgrades and constant patch management.\nThe more machines worked with, the more challenging this can become. General hardware and software asset management becomes essential as either can easily become out of date, leaving the entire IT network vulnerable to failures which can undermine productivity and efficiency.\nIt's not just physical hardware that needs to be secured though, as identity management and firewalls are also now integral security features, as are mobile device management solutions for smartphones and tablets brought to work.\nHowever, there are solutions out there aimed not just at managing those networks, but making the whole process easier. The challenge is to find the best network monitoring tools that work for you and your business.\nHere we feature the network monitoring tools currently available.\nHow we test the best network monitoring tool\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service. We also analyze whether there are collaboration features for multiple users, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

You can build and deploy different types of robots. The platform even comes with ready-made robots designed for various use cases, e.g., healthcare, finance, manufacturing, etc. A good example is using robots to process invoices and vendor payments and generate accounting reports.\nA good thing about UiPath is that you don\u2019t need deep coding experience to create robots on the platform. It offers a drag-and-drop interface to create robots by simply moving modules from one place to another. Your coding expertise still helps to create advanced robots, but it\u2019s not necessary, unlike with many rival RPA platforms.\nUiPath offers excellent customer support. You can contact a human support representative whenever you want and you also have access to a large collection of user guides, manuals, and video tutorials concerning all aspects of the platform. The drawback is that UiPath is pretty expensive, starting at $420 monthly.\nBest IT Automation software for large businesses\n4. Atera\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAtera is a remote monitoring and management software. It enables IT teams to stay on top of their technical infrastructure and ensure that things are always in good shape.\nThis platform incorporates artificial intelligence to help IT personnel automate a lot of tasks.

You can manage all your Azure infrastructure from one place and automate a lot of tasks. For example, you can automatically monitor and troubleshoot your servers at specific periods to detect any issues before they morph into something more serious. You can allocate virtual machines depending on demand instead of renting unnecessary server space with hopes of future demand.\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t offer a free plan for System Center, which is a disadvantage. Pricing can also run up to thousands of dollars annually, which makes it suitable for large organizations with significant IT budgets.\nA good thing about System Center is that it also enables you to manage on-premise IT infrastructure (servers and PCs) and not just cloud-based ones only.\nBest IT automation tool FAQs\nHow to choose an IT automation platform\nCost\nCost is the first thing to consider when choosing any software. You need to choose something that you can afford in the long term. Pricing for automation tools usually depends on the number of tasks and how big your IT infrastructure is, so it should be easy to estimate how much you\u2019ll pay beforehand.

It should have an intuitive interface that a layman can understand. Complex interfaces can frustrate users and cause costly mistakes.\nCustomer support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you\u2019ll need external help to solve your issues. Ensure you choose an IT automation platform with a solid reputation regarding customer service; check user reviews to confirm this.

Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nRobotic process automation (RPA) entails building and deploying software robots to handle repetitive tasks. For example, you can build bots to scrape websites and extract contact information or create bots to process employee payroll based on the number of hours worked.\nYour IT automation platform should let you build RPA bots, preferably with a drag-and-drop interface.\n2. Incident management\nYou should be able to manage technical incidents with ease. Your tool should give automatic alerts whenever it detects an IT incident and contact the personnel assigned to that issue beforehand. This feature takes away a lot of stress during the inevitable IT incident.\n3. Endpoint management\nThe tool should enable IT staff to manage multiple devices connected to the enterprise network and automate many tasks. For example, you should be able to install software automatically on all connected devices. It could be a new software recommended by management or an update to an already installed software.

These are a great way of seeing if this is the sort of career you'd like.\nEven still, some of the free providers do also provide paid courses which are often cheaper than undergraduate study, and may allow not just for suitable training but also industry connections to help on your path.\nTherefore if you really are interested in exploring cybersecurity, try some of these featured courses to get an idea of whether you might suit the industry, and vice versa, but do be aware that any free training will generally be quite limited.\nAdditionally, check our featured best free VPN.\nReader offer: Top courses from $14.99 when you first visit Udemy\nUdemy is an online learning platform where you can access over 25,000 courses all taught by professionals. Choose from a vast course catalog with topics ranging from programming to lifestyle.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best online cybersecurity courses of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest online cybersecurity course overall\nReasons to buy\nLike Future Learn, Coursera offers a range of short courses for distance learning, including a number of cybersecurity ones such as \"Cybersecurity Specialization\" which was created by the University of Maryland to bring the underlying concepts of the construction of secure systems directly to your web browser.\nIt consists of five courses in total, each of which can take several weeks to complete. These range from Usable Security to a Cybersecurity Capstone Project, so it\u2019s safe to say that they'll require you to already have some intermediate cybersecurity know-how under your belt.\nThere are additional cybersecurity courses available, though, covering everything from the basics to more advanced specializations.\nThere are also online degrees available in either computing and IT or data science, although none are focused specifically on cybersecurity, you can be assured that cybersecurity will be a significant part of the curriculum.\nOverall, Coursera isn't so well-presented as Future Learn, but there are potentially more accredited options for study through it.\nRead our full Coursera learning platform review.\nBest budget online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTypically, courses on Udemy cost money, but we\u2019ve found a few worth checking out that won\u2019t put a dent in your bank account.\nThe \"Cyber Security Course for Beginners - Level 01\" could also be advantageous to take, not only for cybersecurity enthusiasts but for anyone who want to learn more about the subject. This particular course offers free video content, but you will not receive a Certificate of completion, instructor Q&A or direct messages.\nHowever, Udemy's real selling point is that not only does it offer some very in-depth courses, many of these courses are extremely cost-effective.\nPaid courses worth looking for for include \"Cyber Security Crash Course for Beginners: Learn From Scratch\" but there are also others to consider such as \"The Data Science Course 2020: Complete Data Science Bootcamp\" which will help provide an insight into the intricacies of computer science.\nIt's worth underlining just how comprehensive and intensive the paid courses can be, and while they may not carry any traditional educational accreditation they could be excellent options if you wanted to consider working as a freelancer to build up some experience, and in a very cost-effective way, too.\nRead our full Udemy learning platform review.\nBest short online cybersecurity courses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFuture Learn offers a wide range of short and free online sources, with the opportunity to pay for certificates of participation either at the course level or else access all content for a set fee. The courses themselves are well-presented in short and easy to work sections that make learning simple and interesting.\nThe \"Introduction to Cyber Security\" offers a free taster to the subject, and is accredited by UK Government intelligence organization GCHQ, global accreditation and examination institute APMG International, and The Institute of Information Security Professionals. However, there are also a small number of accredited degrees available in IT and computer science which includes a masters degree in cybersecurity.\nOverall, while Future Learn is more focused on general introductory short courses, there are paid-for and accredited learning opportunities available through the platform.\nRead our full FutureLearn learning platform review.\nBest military-grade online cybersecurity course\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNexGenT was created by two US Air Force veterans with extensive experience teaching and training network engineering and cybersecurity.\nThe cybersecurity track features two courses: Basic Training, which serves as a prerequisite, and Cyber Security Specialization. Experienced candidates, however, can skip Basic Training by taking a series of tests to prove their skills.\nBasic Training prepares you for both Full-Stack Network Associate (FSNA) and Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certificates.

After seven years, all remaining debt is forgiven, even if you haven\u2019t paid a cent. That\u2019s how confident NexGenT is that you\u2019ll find a job and earn a living. (Although, the zero-fee tuition option seems not to be available at the moment)\nThat confidence is backed up with some impressive figures: more than 50,000 enrolled students, 460,000 classes taught, and a number of success stories attesting to the effectiveness of their training.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a solid and structured way to enter the professional world of cybersecurity, this may be the right course for you.\nFor more information, read our full NexGenT review.\nBest accredited online cybersecurity course\n5. Open University\nReasons to buy\nThe UK's Open University (OU) is a leader when it comes to distance learning, having spent decades developing its courses, and it serves an international range of students.

The OU also offers a dedicated degree in Data Science.\nFor the full 3 year course, the cost is around $21,500.\nThe big advantage of the OU is that it can deliver an accredited degree in computing internationally, and aims to embrace all learners while allowing them to define their own learning path. Additionally, you can take up to 16 years to qualify for your degree through part-time learning.\nBest free online cybersecurity courses\nBest extensive online cybersecurity course\n1. Cybrary\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAs the name suggests, Cybrary is an online library for cybersecurity, IT and other InfoSec-related study materials. After creating a free account, you get access to almost 500 courses, each ranked by their difficulty and all of them free.\nYou can filter classes by level \u2013 Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced \u2013 or by vendors like Cisco, (ISC)2 and Microsoft. Whether you want to learn the fundamentals of malware or the art of the Jedi mind trick, both of those curriculums are given equal prominence in Cybrary\u2019s extensive course catalog.\nWhat is especially good about Cybrary's courses is that they tend to focus on specific aspects of IT, which means if there are areas you'd prefer to specialize in then you can focus on that rather than have to take a larger course to access it.\nBest government online cybersecurity course\n2. CISA\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency) is part of the US Department of Homeland Security, and is an obvious source of cybersecurity expertise.\nHowever, you may not have been aware that you don\u2019t have to travel all the way to the United States to benefit from the vast experience of US government security experts, or that you can do so for free.\nThe DHS has a calendar full of training events you can attend in Idaho Falls, but for everyone who doesn\u2019t live in the midwestern US there\u2019s an entire portal of online courses available to those involved in the security of industrial control systems.\nBest general online cybersecurity course\n3. Open Security Training\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIts website looks like what you'd get if you took all the slideshows and teaching materials from a university cybersecurity department and uploaded them to a domain sporting the most minimalist user interface of all time, but Open Security Training is host to a range of intermediate and advanced classes, along with a swath of beginner lessons that any newbie would be a fool to pass up.\nThere\u2019s a whole rundown on the x86 and x64 architectures wielded by Intel processors, along with introductions to topics along the lines of cellular security, network forensics and vulnerability assessment.\nBest online cybersecurity course for beginners\n4. Heimdal Security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFrom the same firm that brought you The Daily Security tip comes Heimdal Security\u2019s Cyber Security Course for Beginners. Although this, too, is email-based, its syllabus is significantly more extensive than that of The Daily Security Tip.\nThe Cyber Security Course for Beginners delivers a new lesson every two days for five weeks, and all without the need to pay back any tuition loans.

      "text": "Best DDoS protection of 2025\nKeep your web services from being overwhelmed with a little help from these industry legends\nThe best DDoS protection services make it simple and easy to stop your business from falling victim to a DDoS attack.\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have the potential to cost businesses a lot of lost revenue that even the best web hosting providers can struggle to mitigate. They work by using a bot network to flood a particular target server with frivolous requests, in the hope that the server will become so overwhelmed it slows to a stop.\nThis is a problem because if the server is unable to respond to normal user requests, then any website or software being hosted by it will no longer be accessible. Even worse is that hackers can then jump in and try to take control of any server systems as they try to come back online, as with most server functions reduced or restricted the server can become especially vulnerable to attack.\nIf that wasn't bad enough, DDoS attacks can last for hours or even days, bringing your business to a halt.\nThe only way to try and mitigate such an attack is to begin to filter the incoming web traffic, IP by IP, which is a slow and laborious process, and not always effective if a large bot network is directed against you.\nTherefore the ability to prevent a DDoS attack from happening in the first place can give you a very real peace of mind.\nIn this guide you'll discover major infrastructure providers who can provide the best DDoS protection, as they have the necessary digital muscle to protect against attacks designed to flood your network capacity.\nGcore DDOS protection offers hosting, cloud, storage, CDN, DNS, streaming platform, and security. Covering up to three layers, with a focus on network (L3) and transport (L4), its firewall provides real-time bot protection.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best DDoS protection of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest overall\n1. Project Shield\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nProject Shield is the creation of Jigsaw, an offshoot of Google's parent company Alphabet. Development began several years ago under George Conard in the wake of attacks on election monitoring and human rights related websites in the Ukraine.\nProject Shield is able to filter potential malicious traffic by acting as a reverse proxy which sits between a website and the internet at large, filtering connection requests. If a connection seems to be from a legitimate visitor Project Shield permits the connection request. If a connection request is determined to be bad e.g. multiple connection attempts from the same IP address, then it is blocked. This system makes Project Shield extremely easy to implement simply by changing your server's DNS settings.\nAny power users reading may wonder how filtering traffic via a proxy will work with SSL. Fortunately, Jigsaw has thought of this and has put together a comprehensive tutorial to make sure secure connections to your site work seamlessly. Several other tutorials are also available in the support section.\nCurrently Project Shield is only available for media, election monitoring and human rights related websites. The primary focus is also on small under resourced websites which cannot afford expensive hosting solutions to protect themselves for DDoS. If your organization doesn't match these requirements you may have to consider an alternative solution such as Cloudflare.\nBest general\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAnyone who has used the Internet in the last few years will be familiar with Cloudflare as many major websites make use of its protection. Although Cloudflare is based in the US it maintains over 180 data centers around the world: an infrastructure to rival Google's. This maximizes your site's chances of staying online.\nEvery Cloudflare user can choose to activate the 'I'm under attack' mode which can protect against even the most sophisticated of DDoS attacks by presenting a JavaScript challenge. As a matter of routine Cloudflare also acts as a reverse proxy sitting between visitors and your site host to filter traffic in much the same way as Jigsaw's Project Shield.\nVisitors making connection requests have to run a gauntlet of sophisticated filters including site reputation, whether their IP has been Blacklisted and if the HTTP header seems suspicious. HTTP requests are finger printed to protect against known Botnets. As an industry giant, Cloudflare can easily leverage its position by sharing intel across the 7+ million websites it protects.\nCloudflare offers a free basic package which includes unmetered DDoS mitigation. For those who are willing to pay for a Cloudflare business subscription more advanced protection is available.\nRead our full Cloudflare review.\nBest for real-time protection\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGcore stands out with its premium web services, boasting state-of-the-art features and enhanced security. It caters to all contemporary web requirements, offering a range of efficient solutions, including hosting, cloud, storage, CDN, DNS, streaming platform, and security.\nThese services aim to protect users up to three layers, with a special focus on the network (L3) and transport (L4) layers. Thanks to its advanced firewall, it offers real-time bot protection and is one of the best in this field. What\u2019s more, GCore is open to working with clients to develop custom features tailored to their businesses' specific needs. Keep in mind that a custom solution will require substantial technical knowledge from your side.\nGcore approaches pricing through a tiered system, especially their DNS services. Businesses needing the most comprehensive feature set can opt for the \u2018Enterprise\u2019 tier, for which you will have to contact the sales team. Server protection pricing is structured slightly differently. The 'Start' tier is priced at \u20ac2.60 per month, providing L3 and L4 protection for 1 Mbps of traffic. The 'Pro' tier, at \u20ac3.90 per month, expands the protection to include the L7 layer for the same amount of traffic. This pricing and service structure positions GCore as a versatile option for businesses of various sizes, ensuring reliable protection in the ever-evolving digital landscape. Yet, we would have liked the pricing structure to be structured in a more user-friendly manner and more transparent overall.\nBest for AWS\n4. AWS Shield\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAWS Shield protection is provided by the good people of Amazon web services. The 'Standard' tier is available to all customers at no extra charge. It protects against more typical network (layer 3) and transport (layer 4) attacks when used Amazon's Cloud Front and Route 53 services.\nThis should put off all but the most determined hackers. However, your bandwidth e.g. 15Gbp/s will still be limited by the size of your Amazon instance, making it feasible for hackers to carry out a DDoS attack if they have sufficient resources. Worse still, you remain responsible for paying for the extra traffic to your instance.\nTo mitigate this Amazon also offers AWS Shield Advanced. A Subscription includes DDoS cost protection, which can save you from a huge spike in your monthly usage bill if you are the victim of an attack. AWS Shield Advanced can also deploy your ACL's (Access Control Lists) to the border of the AWS network, giving you protection against even the largest of attacks. Also, web applications are now automatically protected against DDoS attacks by AWS Shield Advanced without the need for manual intervention.\nAdvanced Subscribers also benefit from a round the clock DRT (DDoS Response Team) as well as detailed metrics on any attacks on your instances. The peace of mind afforded by AWS Shield Advanced is expensive however. This is in addition to data transfer usage costs which you can cover on a 'pay as you go' basis.\nBest for Azure\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLike Amazon, Microsoft offers the option to rent service space via their service Azure. All members benefit from basic DDoS protection. Features include always on traffic monitoring and real time mitigation of network (layer 3) attacks for any public IP addresses you use. This is the very same type of protection afforded to Microsoft's own online services and the entire resources of Azure's network can be used to absorb DDoS attacks.\nFor organizations in need of more sophisticated protection Azure also offers a 'Standard' tier. This has been widely praised for being very easy to enable, requiring just a few clicks of your mouse. Crucially Azure does not require you to make any changes to your apps although the standard tier does offer protection against application (layer 7) DDoS attacks via the app gateway web app firewall. Azure monitor can show you real time metrics if an attack does take place. These are retained for 30 days and can be exported for further study if you wish.\nAzure constantly checks web traffic to your resources. If these exceed a pre-defined threshold, DDoS mitigation is automatically launched. This includes inspecting packets to make sure they aren't malformed or spoofed as well as using rate limiting.\nBest for Asia\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCDNetworks (formerly CDN360) is a powerful CDN service that offers various other cloud solutions, like media streaming, object storage, web application firewalls, and so on. However, it is its Flood Shield product that makes it a great DDoS protection provider.\nFlood Shield is a cloud-based DDoS protection service that aims to deliver fast, simple, and most importantly, effective DDoS protection. It is designed to protect websites, web apps, and network infrastructure from attacks such as SYN Flood, ACK Flood, ICMP Flood, UDP Flood, HTTP Flood, SlowLoris attack, Layer 3/4 and Layer 7, and so on.\nThe service has a good deal of features like the option to customize access policies and rate limiting in advance to avoid attacks and abuse of resources, or alerting options that notify you any time there are some irregularities with a website.\nFlood Shield has a 15+ Tbps of mitigation capacity and over 20 global DDoS scrubbing centers. Also, HTTP/HTTPS and TCP/UDP protocols are supported. In addition, you can have three presets for DDoS attack protection that are easy to switch when responding to different types of attacks.\nWhile CDNetworks has pricing plans for the CDN service, if you solely want the DDoS protection via Flood Shield, you\u2019ll have to contact them first. You do get a 30-day free trial though, if you want to check it out before anything else.\nWe've also featured the best IP address tools.\nDDoS protection FAQs\nWhich DDoS protection is best for you?\nWhen deciding which DDoS protection to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a more expensive platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can usually cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your DDoS protection.\nHow we tested the best DDoS protection\nTo test for the best DDoS protection we first set up an account with the relevant provider, then we tested the service to see how it could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each DDoS protection service to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best alternative operating systems of 2025\nLook beyond Windows, MacOS, and Linux\nCheck out these unique alternative operating systems you can install on your computer, from the sublime to nostalgic to the bizarre.\nWhether you're fed up with Windows, Linux, or macOS, or you just want something new to experience or play with, you'll be happy to know there are some great alternative desktop operating systems worth exploring.\nWhile there are no absolute definitive answers here \u2013 everyone's use case is different, after all \u2013 we've discovered a number of distinct examples that fall outside the usual bounds.\nOur list even includes a few true outsiders, independent operating systems built from the ground up which serve mainly to prove just how difficult it is to create an entire functioning OS without a large number of brains working on it.\nEverything here can be tested reasonably within a virtual machine, so if something grabs your interest don't hesitate to download and give it a try.\nCheck out the best web hosting services in the world right now.\nThe best alternative operating systems of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest alternative operating systems: ArcaOS\n1. ArcaOS\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nArcaOS is an operating system based on the last IBM release for OS/2. While OS/2 barely survives as a legacy system, even after being extended for a while as eComStation, ArcaOS 5.1 is still being actively developed. The English edition will be released first with the Spanish, German and other language editions to follow.\nArcaOS includes a robust Unix compatibility subsystem, featuring a variety of ported Linux apps and some drivers, but still features the OS/2 Workplace Shell.\nArcaOS is a 32-Bit OS that runs on the x86 processor architecture, so should be compatible with some particularly old PCs. This means it can run 16 and 32-Bit OS/2 applications as well as certain 32-Bit Windows apps. It can also run most DOS programs including games. Though its native file system is JFS, it ships with drivers for the FAT32 file system.\nThere are two editions available: Personal, which retails for $129 per license, and Commercial, which retails at $229 per license, though volume discounts are available. The personal edition includes 6-months support and maintenance, while the commercial edition includes one-year of priority support and maintenance.\nBest alternative operating systems: Haiku\n2. Haiku\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWe're a bit sad that BeOS didn't take off. A stylish multitasking OS that introduced a whole host of features that Windows, Linux and macOS would later adopt for their own, BeOS was a true multimedia innovator that left the market with a whimper when its rights were sold to Palm in 2001.\nThe spirit of the closed source BeOS lives on in the form of Haiku, an open source re-implementation which began development immediately after Be's demise, and it has been in development since.\nBuilt from the ground up but designed to be backward-compatible with its classic quarry, Haiku follows BeOS' lead in its entirely modular design, allowing different components of the OS to be developed concurrently. Technically Haiku is still considered to be under development so there's no stable release. The second Beta release (R1) came out in December 2022 around 18 months after the previous beta.\nIt's worth playing with just for the cleanness of its desktop, and there are working web browsers and media players, although it's still rather experimental and many of the features of BeOS haven't quite been fully realized as yet.\nBest alternative operating systems: ReactOS\n3. ReactOS\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLinux, as you may know, is a ground-up reinterpretation of UNIX. ReactOS does the same for the Windows NT architecture upon which all modern Windows versions are based. It's completely open source, uses no proprietary Windows code, yet ReactOS is designed to be (and in some cases actually is) compatible with Windows drivers and applications.\nYour mileage may vary \u2013 it's certainly not going to play nice with high-end games or software, and ReactOS isn't quite up to the Windows 11 level yet. It's currently aiming at full compatibility with Windows Server 2003.\nSo it's clearly a bit behind the times, but ReactOS does have its uses. Incorporating parts of noted Windows emulator Wine. The latest version (0.4.14 can also emulate the Japanese series of NEC PC-9800 computers).\nIt runs LibreOffice, Firefox, Opera and more quite happily, and can even manage some earlier versions of popular commercial applications like Adobe Photoshop. Furthermore, ReactOS now natively supports more file systems than all Windows versions combined. For instance it can boot 64-Bit Linux system using the \"Freeloader\" utility.\nGiven that it's free, it's certainly worth a test to see if any of your older business-critical applications are compatible \u2013 setting up workstations without Windows licensing is a tempting prospect, although we can't vouch for its resistance to attacks.\nBest alternative operating systems: FreeDOS\n4. FreeDOS\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nA ridiculous amount of business software relies on MS-DOS, even to this day. We're still seeing bespoke, newly-developed text-mode apps that run directly from the shell, probably because the complexity and potential for disaster that graphical interfaces add to the mix is not worth the risk in situations that demand 100% uptime.\nThat business-critical software may rely on MS-DOS, but it\u2019ll run just as happily on a FreeDOS shell. As its name suggests, FreeDOS is a fully-compatible but completely free and open source remake of DOS that can handle just about everything its proprietary counterpart can. That does, of course, mean no multitasking, no protected mode, no GUI, but it'll run your games and can even manage Windows 3.1 as long as you're running it in standard mode.\nAs you might expect, it's not a static recreation of the final commercial DOS release in 1995, and indeed hasn't been static since it first emerged in 1998. In fact, FreeDOS remains in active development, and features a number of integrated improvements compared to its rather archaic ancestor. The latest release (1.3 is available as a \"live\" bootable CD or USB). The 'Lite' version is less than 32MB, so is perfect for test-piloting with your system. There's also a 'Legacy' version for older machines.\nBest alternative operating systems: Wayne OS\n5. Wayne OS\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWayne OS comes from a Korean startup that forked the open source Chromium OS (from which Google derives its Chrome OS) to create an OS for regular 64-bit machines instead of Chromebooks.\nOriginally called Chromic OS, the project changed its name to Wayne OS in 2019. Instead of a traditional installation, the distro is designed to be installed in bootable USB flash drives.\nWayne OS is meant for all kinds of end-users. To install it, simply download its compressed installer and then extract the executable installer from the archive and fire it up. This will bring up the Wayne OS installer. The project's YouTube channel has some helpful video tutorials on how to install Wayne OS both to a USB stick and a PC.\nSelect the version you want to install and then point the installer to the USB disk you want to install it on. Wait for the installer to download and copy the necessary files to the USB disk. You can choose to unplug the now bootable USB disk and use it to run Wayne OS on any 64-bit computer.\nWayne OS also now supports an \"Improved Live USB\" which allows you to use the drive as removable storage in Windows/macOS. The system partitions are also hidden.\nBest alternative operating systems: OpenIndiana\n6. OpenIndiana\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSun Microsystems' SunOS \u2013 which evolved into the rechristened Solaris \u2013 began as a proprietary UNIX distribution designed to support Sun's SPARC processors. Its list of supported hardware widened as it grew, and in 2005 Sun released the source code in the form of OpenSolaris, leading to advanced community development. And then Oracle purchased Sun, renamed the OS once more to Oracle Solaris, and decided to cease source releases, effectively closing the source once again.\nSometime after this move, the community took it upon themselves to maintain OpenSolaris. They decided to ditch its development tools and processes and created the OpenIndiana Hipster branch to modernize the OS. Hipster is compiled with GCC instead of Sun Studio and follows a rolling release model and the release team puts out installable snapshots every six-months.\nWhat makes OpenIndiana (OI) approachable to new users is that it runs familiar apps on its desktop. It uses the Mate desktop along with its cache of tools as well as a handful of mainstream productivity apps such as Firefox, Thunderbird and Pidgin. While there is not much to write home about OI\u2019s default cache of apps, one that caught our eye was the TimeSlider app for taking incremental ZFS file system snapshots. It isn\u2019t enabled by default, but is fairly intuitive to setup and use.\nBest alternative operating systems: KolibriOS\n7. KolibriOS\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKolibriOS is written in the FASM assembly language and based on the source code of the MenuetOS operating system. It boots in a flash and gives you access to a number of useful apps. There\u2019s no installation involved, though you\u2019ll have to make sure you select the option to save the changes you made during the session when you shut it down.\nThe OS supports FAT and NTFS file systems and ships with drivers for popular audio, video and Ethernet hardware. The desktop is fairly intuitive to operate, and new users aren\u2019t reprimanded for casually exploring the desktop and its various apps.\nThere are over 200 applications available for KolibriOS but the productivity apps aren\u2019t really mature enough for everyday use. The lack of a package manager doesn\u2019t help its case either. On the other hand, if you like retro gaming there\u2019s no better OS, as KolibriOS supports games including Tetris, Sokoban and a respectable Space Invaders clone.\nBest alternative operating systems: Icaros Desktop\n8. Icaros Desktop\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNostalgic open source fans can still get their dose of Amiga-esque goodness through Icaros. This is a distribution of Aros, which is an OS based on the AmigaOS API. It\u2019s important to note that this isn\u2019t a clone of AmigaOS, but an implementation of its API in a new operating system. Unless you\u2019re familiar with the AmigaOS of yore, you\u2019ll have a pretty tough time getting to grips with Icaros.\nIt\u2019s tricky to install, and it\u2019d be a frustrating experience to even attempt to explore the OS without first reading its user guide. First-time users should appreciate the fact that the OS is distributed as an installable live CD to whet their appetite. Click on the eye icon in the panel to get an Applications menu, or on the filing cabinet to get a selection of manuals.\nYou can also install Icaros in 'hosted' mode as a standalone app within your existing system. The OS can also be booted within a virtual machine.\nIcaros has pretty decent hardware support, but still don\u2019t expect it to work with fancy graphics cards and all wireless network hardware. Icaros has all the apps you need to use it as a regular desktop, but its real specialty is retro gaming, and that\u2019s one area in which it really shines. The built-in Janus-UAE emulator provides binary compatibility to Amiga programs, games and demos.\nBest alternative operating systems: Visopsys\n9. Visopsys\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe goal of Visopsys is to create a fully functional OS for Computer Science students and alternate OS enthusiasts like us. Considering the fact that it\u2019s primarily an educational system, it surprised us with its usability.\nThe OS boots in a snap and gives you the option to either launch the installer or boot into a Live session. The inclusion of a very capable partitioner in the installer is another pleasant surprise.\nThe desktop is fairly simple to navigate and includes a handful of essential apps, plus handy administration and configuration utilities. But attempts to use it for regular desktop tasks won\u2019t take you very far.\nThere's a basic image editor and you can play Minesweeper and Snake. However, the OS is missing a web browser and there\u2019s only a basic text editor. There's also no package management to help you pull in additional apps and utilities.\nVisopsys does a nice job of masquerading as a regular desktop, but it really is a very capable CS project and should be treated as such.\nGone but not forgotten: other Operating Systems\nGone but not forgotten: other Operating Systems\nIt's worth noting that there have been a number of other operating systems that were previously popular but have since been discontinued. One of the most famous of which is AmigaOS, used in Amiga personal computers during the 1990's and which had a reputation for solid stability.\nHowever, here are a few more that you may or may not have come across before now.\n10. eComStation\nOS/2 may not have set the world on fire, but it actually maintained a decent industrial and commercial install base long after its desktop aspirations died. eComStation was a derivative OS that uses classic OS/2 technologies on modern hardware.\nMuch like its ancestor it's been developed with security and stability in mind for commercial applications. We see the claim 'zero downtime' repeated all over the place, and while it's theoretically possible to lock up your hardware with the wrong application, this is something that could have been a real killer feature.\nThere's a host of open source software ported to eComStation including Firefox, OpenOffice, VLC and more, and it's capable of running DOS, Java and OS/2 applications. You almost certainly don't need it, but if there's something system-critical and OS/2-only that your business relies on, running this on bare metal is a much more reliable idea than setting up a VM.\nAs eComStation hasn't been updated for some years, if you're looking for OS/2 support and development it might be best to look at ArcaOS in the above list.\n11. Syllable Desktop\nDeveloped between 1994 and 2001, AtheOS \u2013 initially planned as a clone of AmigaOS but later following its own path \u2013 was the work of a lone Norwegian programmer, Kurt Skauen. After Skauen abandoned the project, its GPL-licensed source code was picked up by the community and Syllable Desktop was born.\nThe majority of it is composed of unique code, although certain components have been pulled from the vast library of open source Linux programs; there's also a Server version, which is more traditionally Linux.\nSyllable's key selling point \u2013 ignoring the fact that it's free \u2013 is its speed and lightness. The creators recommend a Pentium CPU with 32MB of RAM, which should give you an idea of how lightweight it is. Slap this on a modern PC and you'll likely never have seen an OS so quick.\nSyllable does lack the ports that make other indie operating systems attractive, though it contains a number of native apps for web browsing, email, VNC and more. We're not entirely positive that it's still active \u2013 the last official update was some time in 2012 \u2013 but if there's a very, very old PC you need to resurrect with reasonably modern system architecture, try this.\n12. SkyOS\nThe development of SkyOS has sadly been halted, but it's still worth looking at as an example of an OS constructed from scratch. Developed initially as an open source project by coder Robert Szeleney, SkyOS was based on concepts gleaned from other platforms but didn't originally borrow their code.\nThat said, a few components are based on other packages \u2013 there's no sense, for example, developing an entirely new compiler when GCC already exists, and the SkyFS filesystem is forked from OpenBFS. Later in its life, Szeleney appears to have experimented with a version of SkyOS built on top of a Linux kernel in an attempt to help with driver compatibility.\nThe source was closed midway through its life, and Szeleney continued development based on feedback from a popular (paid) public beta program. Unfortunately the struggle to keep up with ever-diversifying computing standards became too much for the lone coder, and development was halted in 2009, with the most recent beta made publicly available in 2013.\nIt's obviously incomplete, and not suitable for any kind of business environment, but as a curio to run within a VM it's very interesting.\n13. TempleOS\nWhether the extreme religious doctrine behind it interests you or not, TempleOS is an interesting example of a completely independent, unique OS. It was made and maintained with extreme dedication by one man, Terry A. Davis, over the course of ten years.\nTempleOS \u2013 programmed entirely using Davis' own language, the excellently named HolyC, which you also use to interact with its shell \u2013 deliberately includes no networking and absolutely no hardware support beyond that which forms the core PC system. So what's the point?\nTempleOS has been built from the ground up with what seems like no hang-ups on existing operating systems. The entire thing is hyperlinked, meaning you can quickly burrow down to the source of a program just as easily as you can find its dependencies, and it's super-quick; there's no paging, so the whole OS gets up and running within a second or two.\nIt's unlikely you'll be able to use TempleOS for anything solid, and Davis' well-documented mental health struggles didn't help its standing in the community. But it includes a huge number of interesting ideas, particularly the blurring of the division between document and program, which could impact more traditional operating systems. Which is why, despite TempleOS\u2019s development having ceased with Terry\u2019s passing in 2018, the OS is still available for the curious lot out there.\n14. FuryBSD\nWhile FreeBSD is a highly complete and very reliable operating system, it doesn't come with a graphical user interface by default. This is where FuryBSD stepped in to deliver a much more usable FreeBSD using a combination of a familiar graphical desktop environment with some additional tools and functionalities.\nThe OS was available with two desktop environments in separate ISO images, with one based on Xfce that performed well on under-equipped machines, while the other with KDE Plasma was meant for well-stocked computers.\nHowever, FuryBSD ended development in 2020\nAlso check out the best web design software.\nAlternative operating system FAQs\nWhich alternative operating system is best for you?\nWhen deciding which alternative operating systems to download and use, first realize that whichever type you're choosing will probably be quite limited in terms of what you can use it for. Without support for major software tools alternative operating systems tend to be more oddities that are fun to use rather than serious business platforms. Therefore we recommend you simply look to experiment and play with any alternative operating systems, rather than look to use them in a general business role.\nHow we tested the best alternative operating systems\nTo create this list of the best alternative operating systems we downloaded the software for each and set them up on an ordinary desktop computer, either as a second operating system, or else used virtual machine software to run it. In each case we had a good play around with the OS and any bundled software, just to get an idea of how it worked and what it was like as a user experience.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Shining a light on the stealth devices in your IT estate\nHow unseen devices create security gaps in complex IT environments\nThe modern IT landscape is growing more complex every day. It\u2019s predicted that more than $5.61 trillion will be spent on IT this year as companies continually expand their estates.\nThis perpetual growth means that keeping track of everything within the IT infrastructure is becoming increasingly challenging and many organizations operate with significant blind spots in their networks.\nThis gives rise to the \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 \u2013 devices that are unmonitored and unmanaged but can still access critical corporate assets. These are the most dangerous kinds of security gaps, creating vulnerabilities that cannot be closed because they are not even on the radar.\nIt\u2019s time to get past any assumption that \u201cwhat you can\u2019t see won\u2019t hurt you\u201d \u2013 cyber attackers are specifically hunting for the hidden vulnerabilities that organizations overlook.\nCEO of ThreatAware.\nThe problem with traditional IT asset management\nThese security gaps aren\u2019t typically the result of a lack of effort or investment, but a natural byproduct of IT and security teams either not having the right tools or not using their tools effectively. Some teams discover 15-30% more devices that were totally off their radar even though they have been conducting manual audits regularly.\nMuch of this false sense of security is the result of traditional tools that aren\u2019t capable of seeing the big picture. Many agent-based scanners and on-premises security tools only give a narrow view and fail to detect all assets on the network. A device might appear to be secure through the metrics of one tool but actually lack critical controls when linked with other data across the system.\nThis is exacerbated by highly fragmented IT landscapes. Siloed teams and disconnected tools make it impossible to achieve a unified approach to security. Each team might believe they have control of what they can see, but their data doesn\u2019t align. Without an easy way to correlate and compare data and processes, the dots won\u2019t be connected.\nInefficient, manual-heavy processes also limit teams to conducting periodic audits. With IT environments evolving on a daily basis, these audits are outdated the moment they\u2019re completed.\nWhy these gaps are the biggest security risks\nThe cracks in security visibility can appear in multiple forms. One of the most common issues is employees accessing corporate systems via unmanaged devices. This is particularly prevalent when Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies are combined with flexible working but without the controls to back it up. Many people are still accessing corporate data using home laptops that are completely outside of the IT department\u2019s control. This situation means ignoring a threat sitting right on your network.\nWe also often find networks containing dormant or misconfigured assets that appear to be safe and compliant on the surface. Our data finds around 10% of devices lack essential cybersecurity controls, and 20% aren\u2019t properly configured. In the worst case scenario, controls aren\u2019t functioning at all.\nAudit reports may also indicate that a system is offline, but it is actually still communicating with corporate networks and, therefore, still an active security risk.\nThese unseen and unsecured devices are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks, providing an opportunity for threat actors to gain a foothold in the network without triggering any security alerts. Compromising an unmonitored personal machine offers a cybercriminal an easy path in, enabling them to access sensitive information on the network and exploit channels like email for Account Takeover (ATO) attacks.\nHow organizations can close the visibility gap\nIf an organization doesn\u2019t know an asset exists, it has no chance of securing it. So how do teams start finding and accounting for these dangerous unknown unknowns?\nThe first step is to equip IT and security teams with the right tools, along with the expertise and processes to use them. We often find companies have invested heavily in a full suite of solutions, but many of them aren\u2019t being used effectively or may be unnecessary for the company\u2019s needs.\nThis means that, even with these investments, they may not have a clear picture of the security health of their estate. It\u2019s not about frequency, it\u2019s about approach. To reliably find and close these gaps, security teams need both a complete view of their entire network and everything accessing it, and the assurance that this picture is completely accurate and up to date.\nA Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management (CAASM) strategy is central to achieving this visibility and control. This takes a highly automated approach to asset discovery, building a list based on what is actually connected to the network and accessing systems, rather than an outdated inventory.\nOnce a clear and accurate picture of all assets has been established, it\u2019s possible to start delving into how secure each device is. This means establishing if the right security controls are installed, whether they are actually functional, and if they have been properly configured. Proper validation is essential \u2013 it\u2019s never enough to just assume controls are working.\nFrom here, it\u2019s crucial to keep up continuous, real-time monitoring for all assets. Again, automation is key as manually correlating IT asset data is impossible at scale. Automated tools can compare access logs with IT inventories in real-time and flag inconsistencies.\nIt\u2019s also important to move away from device discovery alone and account for application access patterns. Security teams should have a clear view of what devices are accessing key applications and data so that they can spot anomalies such as access attempts from devices outside the managed asset list.\nEliminating the blind spots for good\nSecurity frameworks like Cyber Essentials, ISO 27001 and NIST CSF can provide a good starting point for prioritizing security needs and improving visibility. However, organizations need to foster a culture where unidentified assets are proactively identified and secured. Even a single unmanaged device can open the door to a major breach, so detecting them must be embedded into daily operations, not treated as an annual or quarterly audit task.\nThe reality is that many organizations are unaware of the extent of their IT blind spots and have a chance of closing the gaps with their current capabilities. If you don\u2019t have full visibility, you\u2019re making security decisions based on incomplete data. It\u2019s like locking your front door while leaving the windows wide open \u2013 and then pulling the blinds down so you can\u2019t see the issue.\nCheck out the best IT asset management software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best dedicated server hosting of 2025\nThese best dedicated hosting services are faster and more secure and reliable than other options\nThis page was written by Krishi Chowdhary with additions and fact checks from TechRadar Pro's web hosting editor\nThe best dedicated hosting gives you your own resources, extra security, and more speed and reliability than shared or VPS hosting. As resources are yours and yours alone, there is more flexibility allowing you to do what you want when you want while also ensuring data is secure.\nWith so many use cases you'll only know what's best for you but we've narrowed down the list to these categories to help you find the fastest, most reliable, configurable, or most secure dedicated hosts for whatever you want to do with them.\nYou need a bit more tech savvy with a dedicated host and if you're looking for something for gaming our best Minecraft hosting guide might be a better suit. You may also want to consider whether you really need a dedicated host and whether one of the best VPS servers could also cover your needs.\nThe best dedicated hosting providers of 2025 in full\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest dedicated host\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInMotion Hosting was founded in 2001. With over two decades of experience, it boasts 170,000+ customers, 24/7/365 customer support, and a world-class range of hosting products, including shared, WordPress, VPS, reseller, and dedicated.\nThe highlight is its comprehensive set of security features, including free SSL certificates with 2048-bit encryption, automatic updates, custom firewall, and DDoS protection so that your internet-facing applications and system resources are protected from attacks and malware infection.\nA backup manager comes standard with all dedicated InMotion hosting plans as well. It is an off-server backup and recovery service that protects your data from mishaps. InMotion\u2019s infrastructure is connected to four Tier 1 ISPs, so you can rest assured that your services will always be live even if a natural disaster were to occur.\nAccording to InMotion, all of its data centers are secured by armed guards, locked vaults, and hand scanners\u2014if you are big on security, what\u2019s not to like? It is also an environment-focused hosting company, and its Green Data Center in Los Angeles is proof of that.\nBesides free website transfer and server setup, as well as free backup storage of 10GB-1TB depending on the plan you choose, InMotion Hosting also offers one of the best uptimes in the industry. Its 99.999% uptime guarantee is only bettered (and that too, slightly) by Liquid Web. The service isn\u2019t short on power, either, as higher-end plans can offer 12/24/32-core CPUs and up to 512GB DDR4 RAM.\nInMotion\u2019s dedicated hosting plans start at a reasonable $35/month (renews at $69.99 month), which is more or less on par with the cheapest dedicated hosting plan i.e. IONOS\u2019s. What's interesting is that InMotion doesn't offer HDD storage, no matter the plan you choose\u2014your range of storage choices starts from 1TB SSD and goes up to 2 x 6.4TB NVMe SSD with the most expensive plan ($1599.99/month). Also, only the entry-level Aspire and CC-1000 plans hike their prices on renewal; the rest of them renew at the same initial price, which is great.\nIt's also worth noting that while InMotion hosting does offer phone support, that's only available from the Advanced plan onwards\u2014so, both Aspire and Essentials plans only come with live chat and ticket support. If you are looking for class-leading support, we recommend checking out Scalahosting. Furthermore, all InMotion hosting plans, whether that's dedicated hosting or cloud hosting, are Linux-only. Unfortunately, there's no support for Windows OS.\nBest cloud\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOkay, it's not dedicated, I know but dedicated is becoming less and less popular and being replaced by cloud. If you are looking at dedicated hosting options, you should check out Scalahosting too.\nScalaHosting has over 15 years of experience and is one of the most prominent names in the cloud hosting space. It is the best cloud hosting service in our tests and while it is absolutely a wildcard in this list of otherwise only traditional dedicated hosting services, it is one to watch out for.\nThis is because it is setting forth a much more reliable and cost-effective way of hosting that not only gives customers everything they want from a dedicated server (despite not getting a dedicated physical machine in the traditional sense) but also better redundancy, failover, and scalability.\nYou will save a sizable chunk of your budget with ScalaHosting\u2019s cloud VPS as opposed to a dedicated hosting plan wherein you pay for the entirety of the dedicated server, so no matter how much of its total capacity you actually use, you are going to have to pay the full price.\nHowever, ScalaHosting comes with auto-scaling, meaning you can add/remove RAM and CPU on the fly with just a single click. This way, you will only pay for what you actually utilize\u2014and you will get free credits for any unused resources. Additionally, auto-scaling will help you meet unexpected spikes in website visitors and prevent slowdowns and crashes.\nSpeaking of pricing, ScalaHosting's managed cloud VPS hosting starts at $29.95/month (renews at $49.95 a month) and this plan comes with 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM, 50GB turbo-fast NVMe SSD, and unmetered bandwidth. Strictly in terms of hardware, this is still on par with dedicated hosting plans of, say, DreamHost that costs around 4.5x more and whose only real advantage is increased storage capacity.\nThe next most important ScalaHosting benefit is geo-redundancy, which is the ultimate hallmark of reliability. As part of its geo-redundant infrastructure, ScalaHosting distributes your website\u2019s resources and backups across multiple data centers worldwide. So, regardless of whether a server is facing downtime or is under maintenance, your website will always be up and running.\nAlso, while a dedicated hosting service doesn't offer any money-back guarantee or even a free trial, ScalaHosting comes with a whopping anytime unconditional money-back guarantee. So, you can cancel anytime and rest assured that you will get a refund of the payment pertaining to your plan's remaining duration.\nIn addition to cloud hosting benefits, ScalaHosting comes with a myriad of other benefits (at a much more affordable price point, by the way) that give traditional dedicated hosting services a run for their money. For instance, you get 24/7 real-time protection of all your websites and web applications from web attacks and breaches.\nAdditionally, it offers free SSL certificates, automated backups, brute-force protection, two-factor authentication, and free site migrations\u2014as well as a custom control panel known as SPanel that is more secure, lightweight, and feature-packed than cPanel.\nBest cheap dedicated hosting\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIONOS started operations in 1988, and through its comprehensive product range that includes web, cloud, VPS, and dedicated server hosting solutions as well as website and online store-building, serves both SMBs and large-scale businesses on various fronts.\nWe like how neatly all dedicated server plans are organized\u2014AMD and Intel servers are in separate tiers and everything from the chip\u2019s core-thread count to its base clock and boost clock speeds are clearly mentioned.\nA standout IONOS offering is the pay-per-hour pricing model (and you can cancel anytime) so that you only pay for what you use and nothing extra. The most basic AMD server costs $0.0972/hour ($70/month) and its Intel counterpart is priced at $0.1389/hour or $100/month.\nHowever, the real deal is IONOS\u2019s cheap server deals that start at a mere $48/month (on a 2-year commitment, renews at $75 a month), where you get 16GB RAM, 1TB HDD storage, and a 4-core Intel CPU with a respectable 3.9 GHz turbo boost. What's more, the base SSD plan at $55/month (renews at $85 per month) comes with a 480GB SSD. It\u2019s worth noting that the \u2018cheap server deals\u2019 do not come with pay-per-hour pricing\u2014and you will have to pay an additional charge of $35-$38 per month for Windows.\nThere's lots to like about IONOS\u2019s comprehensive security, too. You get a wildcard SSL certificate, anti-spam, anti-fishing, firewall management, administrative logs (info on all actions performed in the IONOS cloud panel), and VPN SSL that allows you to create a secure VPN connection between a local computer and your cloud server network.\nIONOS is also one of the very few providers we've tested that offer dedicated storage servers\u2014a fantastic offering for large businesses with lots of websites and heaps of data (including large files) to store.\nUnlike in a Network Attached Storage (NAS), in a storage server, the data transfer rate is not limited to the network connectivity rate. Sure, the storage capacity of a NAS can be expanded, but it will be characterized by limited computing power, operations, and transactions\u2014all of these restrictions are eliminated in a storage server.\nComing to the downsides, the uptime guarantee, like InterServer, is 99.9%, which is nothing to sniff at, especially for the price but it\u2019s not extraordinary. Next, although the plans read that they are configurable, there's not much to play around with once you click the \u201cConfigure\u201d button\u2014just RAM, storage, and OS.\nAlso, at the time of writing, almost every extra storage configuration is out of stock. If you are looking for highly (or even moderately) customizable dedicated hosting, you will be better off with Liquid Web or InterServer.\nBest dedicated for beginners\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nHostGator, the best web hosting providers, also offers a straightforward yet powerful dedicated hosting tier. The company is based out of Texas and has been helping customers establish a successful web presence since 2002.\nIn addition to 24/7/365 phone service (toll-free, and you can also request a call back), live chat, and email, as well as server monitoring and remediation, one of the main reasons HostGator is among the best for customer support is that it has separate sections for help articles and a general blog with informational guides on various related topics.\nThe help section has different categories, topic-wise, such as website transfers, WordPress, DNS modification, FTP, MySQL, and Softaculous\u2014and each of them contains answers to queries users may have regarding that particular topic. Then there's also a resource-rich HostGator YouTube channel with step-by-step tutorials, HostGator webinars, and a thriving Facebook community.\nThis is simply fantastic and unlike what we've seen with other providers, namely InterServer and DreamHost. The only dedicated hosting services that come close to HostGator in terms of support are Liquid Web and InMotion.\nWhere HostGator falls behind is customizability. There\u2019s little to no customizability in terms of the actual resources of the plan, but it does offer a lot of options as far as the plan's duration is concerned\u2014from a single month to as long as three years, including quarterly and six-month payment cycles. This is unique to HostGator (and InMotion) and might be an actual perk for users who want dedicated hosting for shorter periods\u2014perhaps for trial purposes or for a temporary project.\nComing to the crux of its dedicated hosting i.e. the hardware, right off the bat, you can see that HostGator likes to keep everything simple\u2014and that there's not enough firepower if you need tons of computational power or even storage. However, it will pull through nicely for small and mid-sized businesses.\nThere's just a single plan to choose from, priced at $141.99/month, which renews at $188.79 a month. This plan comes with a 8-core CPU, 32 GB RAM, and 1000 GB NVMe storage.\nEverything else, from free content transfers and cPanel to advanced DDoS protection and manual backups, are available, too\u2014HostGator\u2019s no-nonsense approach and simplicity are admirable.\n- You could save on HostGator VPS hosting with our HostGator discount codes.\nMost configurable\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFounded in 1997, Liquid Web is a popular hosting service provider that has more than 500,000 sites under management, 10 global data centers, and a myriad of both managed and unmanaged dedicated hosting solutions. It's also one of the very few to offer dedicated cloud hosting. To know more about Liquid Web's cloud offerings (which include true auto-scaling and a pay-per-hour pricing model), check out our best cloud hosting page.\nA standout of Liquid Web is the customizability of its plans\u2014it's even more customizable than InterServer as it gives you a few more options to tinker around with. These include a choice of control panel and backups\u2014you can choose between Liquid Web's off-server backup (data is sorted in the Liquid Web Cloud) and Acronis cyber backups where data is stored both off-server and off-site in the Acronis Backup Cloud. And, of course, everything from RAM to storage to bandwidth is easily customizable.\nIt's also right up there with DreamHost as one of the most reliable providers on the market. It guarantees a network uptime of 100% through a clear-cut Service Level Agreement (SLA) that promises to give you free credits if it doesn\u2019t deliver on its promises.\nWe also like Liquid Web's security offerings. In addition to DDoS protection that comes standard with all dedicated hosting plans, you can also opt for an antivirus for malware cleanup and remediation, vulnerability assessment and scanning, and/or an advanced intrusion detection system. However, all these are paid add-ons, starting from $10/month to $49/month for the whole package that's called Server Secure Plus.\nAnother thing to admire about Liquid Web is its overall simplicity. The entire process of customizing your plan is the simplest we've seen\u2014plus, its website design is more pleasing to the eye than, say, InterServer\u2019s very blue and very bold customization page.\nAll that you have to do is select your desired location (US Central/US West/EU Netherlands) and your operating system (Windows/Linux). It\u2019s worth noting that you can change the OS later while configuring your plan.\nBare metal servers, which are self-managed, start from just $23.70 a month (renews at $79 a month). Managed dedicated servers are, of course, pricier, and they start from $59.70 per month (renews at $199 per month). It's also worth noting that Liquid Web offers users the option to build a server from scratch, allowing them to customize it as per their needs and preferences. Not many providers offer this facility.\nMost reliable dedicated hosting\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDreamHost started from a dorm room back in 1997 and has since then served over 400,000 customers spanning more than 100 countries. It currently hosts more than 1.5 million websites and is widely known for its cheap web hosting and WordPress hosting. Today, though, we shift our focus towards its dedicated server hosting services.\nWhere dedicated hosting services are happy offering 99.9% to 99.999% uptime guarantees, DreamHost knocks it out of the park with a whopping 100% network uptime guarantee. This is made possible by DreamHost\u2019s multiple data centers spread worldwide, emergency generators, redundant cooling, and constant monitoring.\nHowever, you are certainly paying a premium for class-leading reliability\u2014DreamHost\u2019s entry-level plan is priced at $165/month on yearly billing. In this plan, you get a 6-core/12-thread CPU, 480 GB SSD, and 16 GB RAM.\nAll in all, if you are after maximum reliability, meaning you just can't afford to have your site down for even the smallest portions of time\u2014and you value simplicity and ease of use\u2014then DreamHost is a solid choice all day long.\nIt comes with an easy-to-use custom-built control panel that allows you to seamlessly manage your websites, email, databases, and billing. A few more likable DreamHost features include unlimited bandwidth, DDoS protection, and OPcache for faster load times.\nAdditionally, you get 24/7/365 expert support on every dedicated hosting plan so that you can get your queries sorted without missing a beat. Plus, there's an in-depth knowledge hub with multiple guides and tutorials on various topics as well as a glossary for beginners for first-hand troubleshooting.\nHowever, for all its reliability and beginner-friendly offerings, DreamHost comes with a noteworthy limitation that's worth discussing. It has only two CPU core options, a 6-core one and the other a 12-core CPU.\nSo, as long as you are getting the 6-core CPU, the maximum storage you can opt for is a 960 GB SSD drive\u2014only on the 12-core CPU plans can you get up to 1920 GB SSD. Plus, that's about the maximum storage you are going to get with DreamHost, as there is also no option to pair an SSD drive with a secondary high-storage HDD drive, which is something you get with some of the other providers.\nMost powerful dedicated hosting\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nInterServer was founded in 1999 by two tech-savvy high-school students and is now one of the most experienced providers in the industry, serving customers with varying needs worldwide, including individual freelancers as well as Fortune 500 companies. It offers the entire spectrum of hosting services, from shared and cloud hosting to dedicated and reseller hosting.\nInterServer is hands down the best dedicated hosting for users who need high-performance computing capabilities i.e. those who work with machine learning applications, complex simulations, or data-heavy workloads. This is because it is the only provider that offers GPU-dedicated servers that are capable of handling the aforementioned tasks all of which need massive processing power which is far beyond the capabilities of even a good high-end CPU.\nWhile every other dedicated hosting service only offers CPU-based servers\u2014notably the Intel Xeon lineup of chips\u2014InterServer knocks it out of the park with AMD Radeon 7900, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, and RTX 2080 Ti. Note that these are among the best graphics cards on the market right now.\nSure, GPU-dedicated servers are more expensive than CPU servers, but given the sheer amount of power under their hood (they also come with 64-128GB memory and 2 x 1TB NVMe storage) and the fact that they are tailor-made for a small section of the hosting audience i.e. customers who need truck loads of power, they are well worth the splurge, especially when InterServer is the only hosting provider offering such a service in the first place.\nHowever, that\u2019s not to say that anyone with standard dedicated hosting needs won\u2019t find value in InterServer. There are tons of CPU-based server options, too, and you can choose from three pre-designed plans with 64-256GB memory, 2-8TB SSD storage, and 1Gbps unmetered bandwidth or get hands-on with its customizable servers.\nWith InterServer\u2019s customizable servers, you get a lot of options to choose from\u2014AMD Ryzen, Intel Xeon, as well as chips from the AMD Epyc series. Not only that, but you can also go as high as a 52-core CPU and pair it up with another CPU with the same specifications to craft a highly powerful server. All of the plans are highly customizable, and you get tons of options whether that\u2019s for RAM, hard drives, the operating system, bandwidth, or IP.\nSo, even on the CPU side of things, there\u2019s a lot of power on offer, plus the advantage with these plans is that they are very competitively priced, with the most basic plan set at a reasonable $64/month and coming with a 4-core CPU, 64GB RAM, 4TB SSD (you can ditch SATA SSD and opt for NVMe SSD at no extra cost), and DDoS protection.\nDDoS protection is undoubtedly a nice security offering, but what we found slightly disappointing is that despite all of the muscle, InterServer doesn\u2019t hit the sweet spot in terms of security\u2014there\u2019s DDoS protection and that\u2019s it.\nHowever, that shouldn\u2019t be a deal breaker for most users, especially when there are quite a handful of other nifty features, such as 24/7 uptime monitoring, remote reboots, zero setup fees, and a Service Level Agreement (SLA) guaranteeing 99.9% uptime guarantee. It\u2019s worth noting that the latter should be taken with a pinch of salt because providers like Liquid Web and DreamHost are out there offering a 100% uptime guarantee.\nBest dedicated server hosting FAQs\nHow to choose the best dedicated server hosting for you\nThere are a number of things for you to consider when choosing the best dedicated server hosting for your online needs. It's is also worth mentioning that different features will apply to different people depending on what you are looking for.\nWe suggest picking a dedicated server hosting provider that is transparent with its services' performance. That way, you are able to determine if it's right for you.\nAlso, it's wise to consider potential downtime. In an ideal world, your website would run 24/7 365. There's also scalability to consider. Monitoring how well your application scales would be a good indicator of whether you need a dedicated server as some applications are difficult to scale on multiple servers.\nWhile looking for the best-dedicated server for your expanding venture, there are essential features you must look out for. Dedicated servers continue to double yearly, each trying to get you to host your website on their server. Your specific needs will, in the end, determine the dedicated hosting server you choose, but here are five features you need to look for:\n- Server uptime guarantee\nMost dedicated servers boast a 99.9% server uptime, but the truth is that no server will be up 24/7. Dedicated hosting servers will have to perform maintenance and updates; hence, servers will be shut down occasionally. With money at stake, you need reliable dedicated hosting. Great hosts should tell you when the server will be down; this downtime is not counted towards the guarantee. You should also set up an uptime monitor to claim the money-back guarantee or analyze the frequency of downtimes.\n- Server location\nChoose a dedicated hosting server to host your website and files close to your target audience. A server with a global CDN like Liquid Web is your best bet if you intend to reach people worldwide. Choosing your server location can help with your website load speed.\n- SSD vs. HDD storage\nWhile looking for a dedicated hosting server, you must evaluate the available resources. A solid-state drive (SSD) is faster, uses less energy, and increases your website's overall performance. On the other hand, a traditional hard disk drive (HDD) only offers more storage and is only a good choice for personal servers.\n- Customizations and add-ons\nEvaluate the operating system and control panel of your server options. Good dedicated hosting usually offers free SSL certificates, DDoS protection, email addresses, email storage, and other perks.\n- Storage and bandwidth\nYour business will keep growing over the years, so it is best to consider features that will make it easy for you to scale. With a dedicated server with more storage, you can house more data and add more products, pictures, and videos. Your site's loading time will increase with greater bandwidth, allowing you to accept more visitors without interruptions.\nWhat is dedicated server hosting?\nDedicated server hosting is a single-user environment where performance is optimal, and the user does not need to compete for resources. It is an internet hosting option where physical servers serve only one business customer. Dedicated hosting users can access the physical server's computing resources, including storage, processors, and memory.\nWith the great features and add-ons on a dedicated server comes the role of maintaining the server to keep it at optimal performance. There are hosts like Liquid Web and A2 Hosting who offer to manage your hosting plan. These managed services usually include updates to security patches, monitoring, periodic virus scans, and backups. Dedicated server hosting offers speed, impressive uptime, security, and data protection.\nDedicated hosting: What are the pros and cons?\nPros\nScalability\nDedicated servers allow you to add as many websites as possible to your server without side effects. The large storage can hold several videos and images. As your business grows and your needs change, you can upgrade to another plan and increase your resources anytime.\nIncreased resources\nYou have root access to the server's resources, including CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth.\nReseller hosting\nSome dedicated servers allow you to resell your dedicated hosting for a good amount of money and earn extra income.\nSecurity\nDedicated servers offer free SSL certificates and DDoS protection, so you do not have to worry about hacks or DDoS attacks launched on other users.\nReliability\nDedicated servers offer great uptime guarantees and complete access to resources, ensuring your site performs better.\nCons\nCostly\nDedicated server hosting is expensive when compared to shared and VPS hosting. While add-ons are available, they come at a cost.\nVery technical\nInstalling operating systems, fine-tuning your firewall, and running content management systems on dedicated servers require technical knowledge and expertise. Some servers have a fully managed service for users without technical expertise, but managed plans are expensive.\nHow much does a dedicated server cost?\nWe figured out that what you spend on a dedicated server depends on the host you choose, SSD or HDD storage, whether you go with a fully managed or unmanaged plan, and if you add cloud hosting to your package. The cheapest dedicated server costs $47 per month from IONOS, and the most expensive best server costs $739 from InMotion Hosting. During signup and purchase, several companies offer a discount on the first month or year for a longer contract.\nSigning up for a longer yearly contract is not exactly a cheap option, but it reduces the monthly cost, and your investment is safe as you can request a refund if the host cannot meet your needs. Your server's hardware also determines how much you might spend on a server. If you go with SSD, which performs better than HDD, you will spend more. Rather than focusing on the price tags on each hosting plan, you should focus on the long-term benefits of dedicated server hosting.\nDedicated vs bare metal\nHosting servers offer traditional dedicated hosting and Bare metal hosting. Dedicated and bare metal servers are single-tenant machines allowing users to rely on their private hardware and improve performance. Bare metal servers differ from dedicated servers in hardware. Bare metal usually comes with the latest hardware, from the newest generation of Intel CPUs to DDR4 RAM, with an Error-Correcting code (ECC). Bare metal servers provide better storage and high-speed 1Gb/s bandwidths.\nDedicated servers can cope with higher concurrent visitors and transactions. You can access hardware resources that fit your needs with a dedicated server. Bare metal and dedicated servers offer similar security, control, and complexity levels. Both give users full access to complete customization of the hosting environment. A big difference between dedicated and Bare metal servers is the pricing model. The Bare metal server offers the performance of a dedicated server with a flexible, per-hour billing structure instead of the rigid monthly or yearly contracts offered by dedicated hosting servers.\nBoth servers exist for different purposes. Dedicated servers are meant to be used consistently for months or years, while bare metal servers can be launched or shut down at short notice. Bare metal is advantageous over dedicated servers because they operate as nodes in wider networks like standalone servers. It is possible to use cloud integration with minimal configuration on a bare metal server, thus, creating hybrid load-balanced setups.\nWho needs dedicated server hosting?\nIf you have more than 1,000 visitors on your site daily, it might be time to consider moving to a dedicated server. Some organizations that need dedicated server hosting include medium and large-scale businesses with large databases, inventory, and hundreds of transactions hourly.\nSystem administrators, developers, agencies, and web hosting resellers need dedicated hosting to customize their environment and run resource-intensive applications like content-management systems, API-driven applications, and e-commerce sites. Dedicated servers also allow them to manage clients in one place.\nMoving to a dedicated server early will prevent slow loading times, crashes, and extra costs. You do not need a dedicated server if you are not in any of the groups above and just started your business.\nIs dedicated hosting affordable?\nYou calculate this using the lifetime cost of hosting your website on a server. During the first year, the cost of using a dedicated server hosting is at its lowest due to promotional discounts offered by the companies. After this period, the billing goes back to its original price.\nPaying low for subpar hosting can reduce conversions and cost you more money. With security patch updates, 24/7 support, impressive uptime, scalability, backups, free email, and an SSL certificate included in every package, dedicated hosting is worth its cost when performance and quality are considered. InterServer is a great and affordable dedicated server.\nIs dedicated server hosting secure?\nYes. Dedicated servers offer more security than shared and VPS hosting because it is not shared with other users. This means a higher level of security against hacking and malware.\nThe best dedicated server hosting: How we test\nSimilar to other web hosting services, testing dedicated server hosting solutions is not much different.\nWe're particularly interested in features that many customers will use, but aren't available from every provider. For dedicated server hosting that could include SLA, public bandwidth, memory and more.\nWe also test and compare other features such as pricing, customer support, performance and ease of use. If you're a beginner, it's nice to know that the dedicated server hosting provider you choose has enough support to guide you through the setup process, should you need it.\nTo choose the top dedicated servers, we analyzed over 12 companies providing hosting services. Based on our thorough testing process, these companies were carefully weighted according to their importance to businesses to ensure we provide accurate and useful information on the criteria for the final 10 best server hosting providers.\nHere are the criteria we analyzed to compile our list:\n- Pricing\nWe looked at the dedicated server's price range to see if they offered discounts during holidays or lower pricing for annual payments. We also considered the number of plans available, money back guarantee, and the payment cycle.\n- Uptime\nWe considered the percentage of the time the server runs without shutdown or restart. This also tells the percentage of your site that will be live per server response times. If your site goes down, customers can be lost to other competitors. Companies with an uptime of 99.9% received bonus points to denote the premium quality of service, while web hosts who could not offer a good uptime were given a lower rating.\n- General features\nWhen a business upgrades from a shared server or a VPS (virtual private server), you can expect differences like a significant increase in storage or disk space, SSD or HDD, data transfer, backups, and RAM. In our analysis, we considered the number of cores available, the processors, and other essential features a dedicated server should offer.\n- Additional features\nWe also looked into the dedicated servers that offer more features besides the essential ones. Companies that offered extensive customization to choose the operating system (OS), increased security, business email, and backup or disaster recovery options were given more points in our rating.\n- Server management\nSome dedicated server hosting offers different management options depending on the users' technical expertise and requirements. We considered the self-managed hosting service and managed hosting provided by dedicated servers, where you can have full control of the server administration or allow the hosting provider to handle routine maintenance and updates on your behalf. Companies offering these options were given more points in our rating.\n- Flexibility\nWe considered the features every dedicated server provided for expanding businesses. Companies that allow businesses to upgrade server resources without limitations are given more points in our rating. We considered this because you are more likely to seek an option that can accommodate evolving business needs.\n- Technical support\nWe considered the host's knowledge base and the support options available. dedicated servers often provide dedicated customer technical support through specialized teams versed in these issues who can assist promptly.\n- Security measures\nWe looked at dedicated servers' normal and extra security features, such as access controls, encryption methods, and firewalls. Companies that offered security features to reduce the risk of security breaches received extra points in our rating.\n- Ratings and reviews\nReviews could be true. We used several review sites like Trustpilot and BBB, social media platforms like Twitter, competitor feedback, and the results of our testing process to give the server a final rating.\n- Expert score\nFinally, we considered expert opinions for each dedicated hosting. The locations of the hosting provider are considered to reduce latency and cater to an audience. Bandwidth up to 5TB transfer is good for a dedicated server every month. Each expert's review and how user-friendly the server is also accounted for our rating.\nOur team of website hosting experts spend countless hours testing and re-testing web hosting services. This also includes scheduling regular demo calls with service providers to go through new product releases, as well as hosting our test websites on each web host.\nWe use various external tools such as Uptime.com and GTMetrix to test the speed and performance of our sites hosted on each web hosting service, and our rigorous testing process also includes comparing bandwidth, storage, security, ease of use, pricing, and customer support.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nKrishi covers buying guides and how-to's related to software, online tools, and tech products here at TechRadar.

Offering coverage across multiple platforms and operating systems, these comprehensive packages often provide the best antivirus, firewall protection, parental controls, a VPN, password manager, and so much more.\nMy team of experts here at TechRadar Pro have spent tens of thousands of hours testing and reviewing hundreds of security products, so we'd like to think we know a thing or two about what makes a good cybersecurity tool.\nIn our reviews, we look at AV-TEST scores for each antivirus package, before going on to examine just how each part of the internet security suite ticks. Whether its VPN server count, inclusion of ransomware protection, or insurance included with identity theft protection.\nBitdefender Total Security remains my top pick for most people, thanks to it's near-perfect scoring across multiple antivirus and security evaluations, attractive price point, and extra features.\nTop 3 internet security suites in 2025\nIn a hurry? Here are our top 3 picks for internet security suites:\n1. Bitdefender Total Security: best overall internet security suite\nOur top recommendation, Bitdefender Total Security offers the best-in-class security for you and your devices.\nFeatures include multi-layered ransomware protection, parental controls, firewall, a Wi-Fi security advisor, a secure browser for online banking, a file shredder, a vulnerability scanner and more.\nPlus with a 30-day free trial, you can give Bitdefender Total Security a go, risk-free.\n2. Norton 360 Deluxe: best internet security suite for families\nNorton 360 Deluxe is a great choice for families as it offers not only parental controls but also a VPN, online backup and dark web monitoring in addition to 50GB of online backup storage.\nNorton 360 Deluxe offers this top-class protection for to 5 devices, and has offerings for both iOS and Android.\n3. Avast One: a great all-round internet security suite\nAvast One offers protection against malicious software, webcam security and data breach monitoring, all wrapped up in one easy-to-use interface.\nNot only that, with Avast One you can protect up to 30 devices with web protection, a VPN, and Avast's Sensitive Data Shield, which adds an extra layer of protection to your private data.\nBest overall internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a whole host of features.\n\u2714\ufe0f You use devices across a range of operating systems - Bitdefender can be used on iOS, Android, Mac and Windows.\n\u274c You have an older CPU as its performance may be impacted.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with advanced PC maintenance tools.\nBitdefender Total Security is the well-respected security firm\u2019s top-of-the-range package and tops the lot when it comes to all-singing all-dancing internet security suites.\nTotal Security is a suite that\u2019s positively bristling with features. You get \u2013 deep breath \u2013 standard antivirus tools plus impressively capable multi-layered ransomware protection, a firewall, a Wi-Fi security advisor, a secure browser (Safepay) for online banking, a file shredder, a vulnerability scanner (to check for missing apps and OS updates), password manager, email spam filter, parental controls, webcam and microphone defenses, and more besides including a superb web protection module for blocking malicious URLs.\nAs well as security features, Total Security provides various PC maintenance and optimization tools. These are somewhat useful in themselves, for cleaning out superfluous files and streamlining boot times \u2013 but more importantly, Bitdefender\u2019s flagship package also covers more than just Windows devices.\nIn fact, an app is provided for Mac users (the software is compatible with M1 Macs, and has been improved to run faster virus scans), as well as clients for iOS and Android mobiles. The Android app also has the capability to block more link-based mobile threats.\nAs it\u2019s only a bit more expensive than Bitdefender Internet Security \u2013 the firm\u2019s mid-tier security suite \u2013 I'd say it\u2019s certainly worthwhile upgrading to Total Security if you have multiple devices across various platforms to protect. (You can see what we think of the range in our full Bitdefender review).\nThere is further good news in that Bitdefender has a minimal impact on system performance, going by independent and my own testing (some rivals do a touch better in this department, but it\u2019s not a difference you\u2019ll ever notice in real-world use).\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s a 30-day free trial of this suite, with no payment details needed; you just have to supply an email address. That means you can try out Bitdefender for a full month before committing to buying and see first-hand for yourself exactly what\u2019s on offer here.\nBest internet security suite for families\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with an integrated VPN.\n\u2714\ufe0f You're looking for an internet security suite for the whole family.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite that doesn't use a lot of resources.\n\u274c You have more than 5 devices you want to use the internet security suite on.\nWhen I evaluated all of NortonLifeLock\u2019s security suite options, I picked out Norton 360 Deluxe as the best value all-around choice for anyone who\u2019s looking to protect more than a single device \u2013 which is likely the majority of folks.\nNorton delivers good basic protection \u2013 although some of the independent test lab results have been a little mixed \u2013 alongside a wealth of features, including webcam protection and dark web monitoring (for users in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and a few other countries), an impressively smart firewall, plus a system of parental controls.\nThe parental controls are top-notch, by the way, including in-depth monitoring systems to keep an eye on what your kids are doing online, and even GPS tracking for their mobile devices. Norton\u2019s very strong in this department.\nThere are some truly worthwhile extras included here, too, like a fully integrated Norton VPN that massively adds to the value proposition of this suite (assuming you don\u2019t have a VPN already, of course), and 50GB of cloud backup storage that's another handy bonus.\nAs for negative points, a flaw worth bearing in mind is that I found Norton 360 Deluxe had more of a drag on system performance than most internet security suites in my own testing. That said, it\u2019s rated as about average in this department by independent test lab AV-Comparatives, and odds are you likely won\u2019t even notice any impact on the speed of your system in everyday usage.\nNorton 360 Deluxe covers up to five devices, either Windows or Mac PCs, plus there are mobile apps for Android and iOS. Pricing is highly competitive compared to rivals, particularly given that bundled VPN, so you should definitely consider this Norton package (compare it to the company\u2019s other offerings with our guide to choosing your Norton plan) \u2013 especially for family usage with those very thorough parental controls.\nBest internet security suite for multiple devices\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a top-rated antivirus engine.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want your internet security suite to cover a lot of devices.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with a fast VPN service.\nAvast One is the trusted security outfit\u2019s revamped suite which offers an umbrella of protection across various bases. That means not just antivirus and ransomware defenses, but also a firewall, webcam protection, data breach monitoring, and a software updater to keep apps patched up with no need for user intervention.\nOn top of that, Avast One provides a full VPN (with unlimited data \u2013 although it\u2019s not the fastest I\u2019ve ever seen, by any means), and some device speed-up and maintenance tools.\nThere are also some more unusual features like a Sensitive Data Shield which scans drives for files that may contain sensitive info like passwords and phone numbers and stops other users of a device from accessing these. In short, you get a lot with the paid subscription of Avast One (there\u2019s a free version which is impressive, too, but it drops a number of features, and the VPN function is limited).\nAll this is wrapped up in a smart and easy-to-use interface which has been thoughtfully redesigned for Avast One, and the cherry on top is the strength of the protection delivered. Avast\u2019s antivirus engine is rated as excellent by the independent test labs, and its web protection is among the best around, too. Furthermore, system slowdown is negligible when running this suite.\nOverall, Avast One packs in a lot of features, and while some of these capabilities may not be as robust as the top performers in this roundup, the sheer weight of what you\u2019re getting means this is one of the best all-rounders out there.\nBest internet security suite for beginners\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with great ransomware protection.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a user-friendly interface.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with configuration options for experts.\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about Trend Micro\u2019s flagship security suite \u2013 Trend Micro Maximum Security \u2013 not the least of which is its polished and user-friendly interface, backed up by superb virus protection. Trend Micro is highly ranked by the independent testing labs, and it offers sterling multi-layered anti-ransomware defenses, too.\nThe package also gives you first-class URL filtering for safer web browsing, further bolstering the overall defenses provided here. That said, one slight weak point with Trend Micro\u2019s offering is that there isn\u2019t a huge amount of low-level control \u2013 such as virus scan options \u2013 so more demanding users may find it lacking here.\nMaximum Security provides parental controls, social media privacy features and PC maintenance tools, although the latter isn\u2019t its strongest suit. It also boasts data theft prevention countermeasures, a secure vault for storing sensitive files, and a decent integrated password manager.\nLess tech-savvy types will appreciate the ease-of-use here, which also goes for the capable mobile apps. There\u2019s a 30-day trial as well, so you can thoroughly check all this out for yourself before pulling the trigger on a purchase.\nBest value internet security suite\n5. McAfee Total Protection Multi-Device\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a high-quality spam filter.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a good value internet security suite.\n\u274c You want a robust malware protection.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with an advanced VPN.\nAs the name suggests, McAfee\u2019s basic security product, Total Protection Individual, only covers one individual device. And if you\u2019re thinking of buying that, and you own more than just a Windows PC, then you\u2019re almost certainly better off purchasing McAfee Total Protection Multi-Device.\nFor not much more money at all you get a sound internet security suite which protects up to five Windows, ChromeOS, or Mac computers, and Android or iOS devices. US customers also benefit from a useful additional extra in the form of identity theft protection.\nMcAfee\u2019s interface is simple and streamlined, which keeps things easy for beginners, although it\u2019ll likely be too sparse for more experienced users. The UI also suffers from some annoying quirks, but nothing too frustrating.\nIndependent test lab reports suggest McAfee Total Protection offers solid enough defenses, if not class-leading. Indeed, evaluations of McAfee\u2019s antivirus engine vary, with some being more scathing than others.\nOverall, McAfee\u2019s suite represents reasonable value and a decent choice in the Multi-Device package, with some nifty extras for boosting web browsing and app performance, plus an integrated (but very basic) free VPN that\u2019s commendably user-friendly.\nBest internet security suite with VPN\n6. Avira Prime\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that covers up to 25 devices.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a built-in VPN.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with robust cyber security features.\nThis is an interesting one in that Avira\u2019s top-level package is missing some of the core security features you might find in other internet security suites, but it more than makes up for this in other ways which might be tempting depending on your own personal needs and use case.\nSo, while a firewall and parental controls might be missing from Avira Prime \u2013 or a backup facility (save for a contacts backup feature on the iOS app) \u2013 you do get some nifty stuff instead. That includes a decent VPN and some seriously high-quality PC maintenance tools.\nIf you want those speed-up tools, and/or have been considering getting a VPN as well as a new security suite, then Prime could be a perfect fit. In fact, in the latter case, Avira Prime works out as storming value for money, providing a solid engine to keep you safe, and that Avira VPN on top to keep you safer still online. Others, however, may miss the aforementioned core suite features like parental controls, of course.\nBest configurable internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that is highly configurable.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with with cloud analysis that picks up undetected threats.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with robust, powerful security features.\nESET Smart Security Premium packs in a lot of features including parental controls, webcam protection, network monitoring, additional network protection, and an anti-theft feature for Windows devices allowing for location tracking is an interesting bonus. Furthermore, Linux systems are covered here, as well as Windows and Mac computers.\nHowever, while ESET delivers lots of features, their quality can be variable. For example, the system of parental controls is very barebones, but the password manager is well fleshed out. ESET also offers plenty of configuration options, which will please experts, although computing novices may find it tricky to get to grips with in some respects.\nESET\u2019s antivirus protection seems solid, albeit with some mixed evaluations from independent testing labs. It\u2019s also worth noting that the suite\u2019s defenses have recently been bolstered with Live Guard, an extra layer of cloud analysis to detect newly emerged threats.\nSmart Security Premium provides some interesting extras, too, including the aforementioned password manager, and a secure, encrypted file vault to protect any sensitive data on your PC, which some folks will doubtless find very useful additions.\nThat said, unless you really want this additional functionality, it\u2019s not the best value for money internet security suite out there.\nFastest internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that covers up to 25 devices.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a built-in VPN.\n\u274c You want to use the it on iOS.\n\u274c You want top-of-the-range antivirus protection.\nWebroot majors in being incredibly lightweight and fast-performing. Indeed, it has a minuscule memory footprint, and takes up next to no space on your system drive, as the product\u2019s virus definitions are all stored in the cloud.\nYet despite this minimal impact on your machine, Webroot Internet Security Plus comes with plenty of features. There\u2019s online banking protection, an Identity Shield to prevent data theft from the likes of keyloggers, ransomware defenses, an accurate anti-phishing system, a smart firewall, plus a password manager as you get a LastPass subscription bundled.\nDownsides? Well, you might get lightning quick malware scans, but Webroot hasn\u2019t fared very well in recent antivirus testing by the independent labs (or at least one of them, as the other big players don\u2019t evaluate this product). The accuracy of its engine is mixed at best, so that\u2019s a somewhat worrying question mark at the time of writing.\nStill, Internet Security Plus is a well-rounded package, and as we pointed out in our review, Windows users could always run it alongside the free Microsoft Defender to get the benefit of Webroot\u2019s bonus features, while doubling up on protection. The company\u2019s 70-day \u2018no questions asked\u2019 money-back guarantee is also noteworthy, showing Webroot\u2019s confidence in its suite.\nFind the best deals on Webroot products with our Webroot promo codes.\nMarch 2025 Update - I have updated this guide to reflect accurate pricing and capabilities, alongside devices-per-license and compatibility. Bullguard Premium Protection used to appear on this list. However, Bullguard products were removed from the market on July 25, 2022 after the company was acquired by Norton. Kaspersky Total Security Anti-Virus used to appear on this list. Considering the current climate however, we've taken the decision to remove the provider. Although much of the company's core processes are now take place in Switzerland, the fact that its headquarters remain in Moscow and there have been previous allegations around government coercion, it feels prudent to use the provider with caution. And, when there are so many other excellent providers to choose from, it's impossible to whole-heartedly recommend Kaspersky at this time.\nInternet security suites FAQs\nWhat is the best internet security suite for 2025?\nWhile there are excellent internet security suites out there from names such as Norton, Avast and Trend Micro, we think Bitdefender Total Security is the best you can get right now.\nAvailable to use on up to 10 devices (including Windows, Macs, Android and iOS) Total Security combines super string virus protection with numerous extra features that genuinely add value to the package.\nFor example, a single subscription includes ransomware protection, firewall, Wi-Fi security advisor, secure browser. file shredder, vulnerability scanner, password manager, email spam filter, parental controls, webcam, microphone defenses and more!\nIt's also really easy to set up and use, while not even being that expensive.\nWhat should I look for in an internet security suite?\nAll of the products on this list offer effective capabilities, so the difference is in additional capabilities. If there is a particular type of threat that concerns you, such as ransomware or phishing, check to see if there are specific protections included.\nBanking safeguards, firewalls and parental controls are also areas you should consider \u2013 especially if there are multiple users on your computer. And of course, you should consider whether you need protection across multiple devices, such as smartphones.\nThe number of additional features and devices may impact cost though.\nFinally, think about usability and the impact on system performance. Do you want a high level of customization or do you want an easy-to-use interface and do you want a program that is capable of fast scans or one that requires minimal system resources?\nDo I really need an internet security suite?\nIt\u2019s certainly true that a good entry-level antivirus will deliver strong core defenses against malware, so why would you want to think about getting one of the best internet security suites?\nAfter all, don\u2019t all apps from the same vendor use the exact same antivirus engine, giving you the same fundamental protection \u2013 while a suite demands a heftier price tag?\nOf course, you\u2019ll get more features with internet security suites, but one perception is that these maybe aren\u2019t all that critical to protect your device. And in some cases, this is true; they\u2019re just nice extras to have.\nBut in other cases, you might get capabilities like secure file vaults for your sensitive data, or a secure browser with which to engage in the likes of online banking \u2013 all of which provide worthwhile additional safeguards. Then there are elements like a password manger, or bundled VPN, which again really bolster online security beyond core measures, if you don\u2019t already have these things.\nFeatures like a free VPN could add to the value proposition of an internet security suite in a big way \u2013 depending on your existing software and needs \u2013 and while we mentioned paying more for a suite compared to a basic antivirus, sometimes security vendors don\u2019t charge much more. Indeed, when deals and discounts come into play, it can be the case that there\u2019s barely any difference in price \u2013 and don\u2019t forget, internet security suites usually support a fair few more devices (which can be a major consideration if you need coverage for family members as well as yourself).\nWhat's the difference between antivirus and internet security suites?\nWhile antivirus software provides a basic level of protection for your system, full internet security expands on capabilities such as scanning files and software, activity monitoring and vulnerability search with features tailored for Internet use.\nIndeed, many internet security products are marketed as \u2018suites\u2019 because they contain several different programs that can be accessed by a single interface.\nThese might include a firewall, anti-spam controls, ad blockers, webcam protection, keylogger protection, parental controls and credit card safeguards. There might also be additional protection against web-specific types of malware such as spyware and adware.\nHowever running so many different types of program might mean that internet security suites use more of your system resources than conventional AV.\nCan I create my own free internet security suite?\nThere are many advantages to purchasing a premium internet security suite from a trusted vendor, but it is perfectly possible to create your own modular suite by picking the most suitable free products.\nWhile this might mean you save money, it does mean you have to do much of the work yourself. You will have to identify the best components, whether its virus protection, firewall or backup software, and fix any problems yourself.\nThe more components you introduce will increase complexity and system resource use. You will also suffer from the pitfalls of using free services such as frequent adverts urging you to upgrade.\nUsing a premium internet security suite means the vendor integrates several services into a single package that can be managed from a single interface. What\u2019s more, they might cover several different types of device and offer different tiers of protection.\nIf you do want to build out your own suite, then you can pick the best of individual components in the following advice guides:\n- Rescue disk\n- Encryption software\n- Anonymous browsing\n- Firewall\n- Cloud antivirus\n- Endpoint protection\n- Online cyber security courses\nIn our latest round of updates, we overhauled this page's layout and structure by adding a quick menu, boxouts to give you the pros and cons of the internet security suites on offer and clearer headings. We also double-checked the pricing, deals, server locations, and unblocking capabilities to make sure the information on this page was as accurate and up-to-date as possible.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBenedict has been writing about security issues for over 7 years, first focusing on geopolitics and international relations while at the University of Buckingham.
