  "title": "Markets Rally As Powell Hints At Sept Rate Cut",
  "description": "Insight with Haslinda Amin, a daily news program featuring in-depth, high-profile interviews and analysis to give viewers the complete picture on the stories that matter. The show features prominent leaders spanning the worlds of business, finance, politics and culture. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "The baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance. Our policy rate is restrictive, modestly so, in my view, The stability of the unemployment rate and other labour market measures allows us to proceed carefully. While the labour market appears to be in balance. It is a curious kind of balance. The longer term inflation expectations, however, as reflected in market and survey based measures, appear to remain well anchored. We will not allow a one time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem. That's Fed Chair Jay Powell firing up sentiment on the markets with his dovish comments, saying a rate cut may still be needed, although he is still cautious. Live from Sydney, this is inside with me, Paul Allen. Well, we dive deeper into the stories that matter with crucial context and sharp analysis. Well, we've got Asian stocks rising after Fed Chair Jay Powell dovish comments a Jackson Hole. Traders also looking ahead to a key US inflation reading as well as a whole lot of earnings headlined by in video. However, doubts are lingering about how much rates may come down. Rebecca's head of fixed income for Asia tells us why things still look uncertain. China's stock markets rally looking shaky as consumers remain hesitant. We're going to get an outlook for the world's second largest economy from S4 Capital founder Martin Sorrell. Also, Indian game developer Nazar Stock has lost almost 20% since the government's online gaming bill passed the lower House. We'll be asking the CEO whether the investor reaction is warranted. Well, let's get straight to our top story. Fed Chair Jerome Powell ending his final Jackson Hole speech with a bang, delivering his strongest signal yet that rate cuts are coming as dovish comments were made for cheers from markets and jeers from President Trump, who says the easing cycle should have begun a year earlier. Heightened political pressure on the Fed was a central theme at this year's symposium, leading to a tense affair that underscored the challenges ahead for the US Central bank. Also adding to concerns is Trump's threat to fire a Fed governor, Lisa Cook, if she refuses to resign over mortgage fraud accusations, Cook's potential removal would give chance Trump the chance to shape the Fed Board in his favor and exert more influence over monetary policy. Meanwhile, other policymakers and economists have been warning against political interference at central banks. And, you know, in my IMF days, I have seen close hand what happens when a central bank stops being independent or when its independence is under threat. It becomes dysfunctional. It starts doing things that it shouldn't do. And and the next step is, is, is yeah, it is disruption. It is instability, if not worse. So I think that this is I think it's it should not be debated. This is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a federal official. And already four of them have had to resign. So what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that has resulted in these four resignations. But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. Well, let's get some more insights now on the Fed with two hotshot head of fixed income Asia at Rebecca, too. Thanks so much for joining us. I want to get the independence question out of the way straight away. I mean, there will be a new Fed chair next year. We can say that with some certainty. But do you think that's going to result in any meaningful change to monetary policy? Because, of course, Jay Powell was a Trump appointee and he has acted independently? Well, we hope so. And I think what is also important for the next chairman is that he's seen to be perceived as actually independent, because, again, when you have kind of doubts on the central banks independence, they can actually help make misinterpret, you know, decisions that otherwise would actually be clearly the right decisions to be made. So I think not only does he have to be seen to be independent, but he has to be seen to be perceived by the market as independent, too. Do you feel that there could be any real risk to Fed independence, or is it just the optics and the idea of that enough? I think that this is it's a very difficult juncture because we're having, let's say, a very pivotal point in the economy and in a cycle where actually in terms of the kind of action that we're expecting, is it an easy one to navigate? So interpretation on either side could be very much something that we have to kind of be concerned with. So as we do that, we as we do that, we have to kind of really decide how that's that interpretation where where things are unsure. For example, this this action now that is been taken by Powell shouldn't actually be in debate. It should be very clear that, you know, the data so far indicates that, you know, a pivot towards looking more at the labour market is more warranted. But the fact that we are actually having to debate that this is the right decision is a concern, I think. Yeah, Well, Jay Powell to date has remained firm to sticking to the data, looking at the data, being independent. And we heard a speech there in Jackson Hole, the market interpreting that as dovish. Did you hear anything from that speech that has changed your view on the path forward for the Fed? I think he's made it very clear that, you know, I think a cut by saying that it's restrictive, that the cuts should should be something very clearly on the way. How much that is and where the uncertainty comes is actually what happens post that, what happens with the data. We all know that actually a lot of the effects from the tariff changes are actually more likely to kind of come through in the fourth quarter. And then what happens then with both the data not only on the price changes but actually also on the impact on on investments, etc.. So again, this kind of leaves more uncertainty for what happens in the fourth quarter. Yeah, well, we will get a read this week on PKI, which is of course the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. We are expecting to see that tick up to 2.9% on year. Is this the impact of tariffs finally feeding through to the inflation numbers? And if so, do you see that being enduring or is it just going to be a one hit and done? I think they're going to have to look through that data point for now, because I do think that we will have to wait a little longer to see how the rest of the impact gets through and how price negotiations happen. Right. This is going to not be a one time where price negotiation happens straight away at the onset of a change in tariffs. But that is going to be and of course, the composition of what is being impacted. So I think the we'll will have to wait so a little bit longer to actually see how that feeds through this idea of waiting a bit longer. It has been a controversial one as well. I mean, we were hearing from Mohamed El-Erian a moment ago on Ft. Independence, but he had other observations as well in terms of the Fed. Sure, it's been data dependent, but it's not been forward looking enough. Do you feel that's a fair criticism? I think it's very hard to be forward looking when policy changes are actually happening with its impact, not clearly visible. So I think a wait and see policy is probably the best way that a central bank should react under circumstances where the data is either backward looking, which is what happened last time when we had the the issues with the pandemic, or that the data itself is ultimately changing its composition because say, times is going to change, you know, supply demand dynamics as well as pricing. So these do warrant a more cautious outlook and a more cautious start to actually how we move. Yeah, it's ironic really, because I had it not been for the tariffs, we might be in a more predictable rates environment, but we have another situation as well where it's difficult to forecast inflation. You're advocating that wait and see approach. But in the meantime, we've seen some interesting changes in the employment data. What do you feel is the more urgent concern for the Fed now? Is it inflation or is it jobs? I do think it's jobs for now because I think the inflation data does need a bit more time to give to give them a clear indication. And I think the reason for waiting that that could actually be very beneficial is actually giving the Fed some sort of credibility, because, again, if he is seen to be kind of moving under pressure, that isn't going to be actually good for the view that the Fed is actually acting in in a fashion that is going to lead to stability. So I, I do think that this is the right manner for central bank to act. Well, the consensus is that we'll get lower rates in the US. It is a question of when. How is that informing your approach to fixed income at the moment? What sort of regions, what sort of duration are you looking at? Yeah. So I think again at this moment the short end is actually a little bit more easy to kind of call because I think in terms of rate movement, the longer and the curve, particularly in the US, is a bit more difficult to say because the inflation impact is a little bit more uncertain. The even the growth trajectory could be seen as was uncertain as well as the fact is that we have to accept that with these uncertainty, higher term premia would be implied within the in the curve. So we're preferring steepening at this point, but probably steepening while the kind of intermediate maturities kind of like fives thirties as opposed to kind of the twos tens where that that that that the short term rates are actually already pricing in fully what the cuts that we're expecting. And how about your expectation around the US dollar? We have seen a slow grind to lower. Do you feel the floor is in yet? No, I don't. I think I think that there is still room for the dollar to to stay soft, whether you know, it does it in one of one fell swoop. And we've had a lot of that softness happen. But I think given both, if you say the trajectory of rates but also the the fact that the economic impact of of the tariffs that we're fearing is actually not has been as horrendous as we had kind of feared in April, does mean that actually it does leave scope for other economies to that would be better than the U.S.. Mm hmm. So let's look ahead to the to the next Fed meeting, of course, later next month, 17th of September. Do you think we're going to get a cut then? And if so, will there be 2550 or are we going to walk away empty handed one more time? Yeah, I think that 25 is probably what everyone is kind of said is already kind of very much baked in. It would be kind of hard pressed not to see that happen. Even if the inflation data does seem to be spiking up. I think they could could still agree to look through that if we have very, very weak kind of data on employment. I still think that it's, again, caveat for them to kind of wait another a little bit longer and then do another 25 rather than do 50 in one go. Yeah. And just before we wrap things up on the Fed's, what's your view on growth in the US at the moment? When you look at the US economy, does that appear to you like an economy that's in need of support through easier monetary conditions? Currently, it doesn't seem like it. I mean, it does. It feels like it, you know, which is why the stock market is it doesn't feel like we're heading towards any much a hard landing. But what is kind of maybe more clear from maybe kind of look through to the employment data and certain segments of the economy, which may need support. But again, that is something that, you know, with one interest rate policy before the Fed can accommodate everything. So again, there may be other policies that can be utilized to affect the employment in certain segments of the economy. All right. To heart of Rebecca. This is going to stay with us. Welcome back. You're watching INSIGHT. Bank of Japan Governor, because China is expecting a tight labor market to continue putting upward pressure on wages. Speaking of Jackson Hole, you also noted the wage growth is spreading from large enterprises to small and medium sized businesses. Lower wages did not directly address monetary policy in his presentation. His comments are likely to fuel growing market speculation about another rate hike from the BOJ this year to hard hit on fixed income. Asia at Rebekka is still with us and to her, it's going to be a busy weekend mid September because we'll have the Fed and the BOJ in the same week. I mean as we expect the fed to tighten to ease. Is the BOJ going to tighten? Well, yes, It seems like a lot of you know, speculation has kind of been out again by Jackson Hole. I mean, the data has been kind of validating, you know, you know, the as they note, wage inflation. We've also had the uncertainty of the tariffs with the U.S. kind of behind us. And then we have the growth has not been as weak as as was feared. So I think all of this gives a lot of room for, you know, at least a 25 basis point hike. Know, you mentioned before the break that you expect to see further weakness in the US dollar as a key beneficiary of lack of that likely to be the Japanese yen, because at the moment still pretty weak. One 4737 right now is the only way up for the yen. I think it could it could help the yen a bit. The central banks, the BOJ start to act a little bit. And actually maybe as we start to see a bit more kind of interest in the Japanese stock market, I think that would also kind of be very beneficial for the and and also I think political pressure certainly would also avoid that actually a little bit of a strengthening in the yen isn't going to be something that is that would be kind of against what the politicians would want. So I think all these reasons give me give us a reason for the yen to benefit a little bit in this cycle up. And what's your view of inflation in Japan at the moment? It's still running pretty hot as the BOJ got this under control. I think they some of it is is is actually imported from the weekend that they can definitely help a little bit with. On the other on the wage side of things you know that is a bit more difficult. It is a very tight labor market. They've had to allow more foreign kind of integrated workers into to help with that. And again, policies such as more women in the workforce is kind of dealing with that underlying tightness, but that isn't going to happen very quickly. So therefore, yes, I think hikes would definitely be warranted at this point, but we've seen some very weak demand recently as well for JGBs pretty much across the curve. It appears there's not a lot of buyers willing to step up to fill the void left by the BOJ. So what are the risks going forward here? How do you see these forces playing out in Japan's bond market over the next few months? Yeah, I think definitely the long and still has a bit of danger to them, particularly with still see steepening as being a real issue there. And I think again, with inflation, we're talking about, you know, still very negative real yields. So that doesn't make it an attractive bond market. I think the currency may benefit from, say, maybe more from from the stock market. But for the bond market, I certainly it is, you know, at least at this moment, still not appealing yet until we get much more concrete kind of action from the BOJ that it is actually normalising the curve and allowing pricing to, you know, be market orientated and then therefore, you know, which may be a lot higher levels than it is the yield levels than it is now. Well, I want to get your views on some of Asia's other major economies as well. And, you know, this week out of India will have second quarter GDP numbers. We're expecting to see a sharp slowdown there, but still 6.6%, I mean, that's growth at a healthy clip. But as you see GDP starting to come down, does that hold any concerns for you? I mean, there's obviously a tariff impact here, but at the same time, a very large domestic economy as well. Yeah. So the tariff impact and I think we don't think is actually going to be very impactful. I think it's I think U.S. exports is only about 2.2% of the Indian economy. So, you know, and then things that really matters in terms of exports, in terms of things like electronics, pharmaceutical, are currently, you know, exempted. So the impact from the tariffs on the Indian economy is less of an issue. However, the domestic economy is slowing and therefore there are but there are some supply side policies that it will look like. India is trying to kind of both of that a bit. Some clarity in the GST liquidity is being kind of put into the and and the RBI have been kind of front running some of this weakness by cutting. So I think all of this kind of does leave us a bit more constructive on actually what's going on with India. And kind of a case in point is S & P decided to upgrade India on the back of a you know, these were kind of a big headline tariffs against India from the US, you know, all validating that the structure still is very much intact. Yeah. Do you feel the RBI needs to be delivering any more support or is it done enough for now, going to just sit on the sidelines for a while? I think it can you can sit in the sideline. I mean, there's still definitely room for another 25 basis points in October if they so wish. But I think they can kind of wait and see if some of these more supply kind of these demand side policies that they're putting in with extra liquidity would actually help to bolster the economy without them having to use monetary policy. Well, we've seen sentiment on Indian Treasuries flipping. They used to be very hot property. Now we've got the yields rising. When do you see the sell off in the Indian bonds ending? Yeah, I mean, I think the you know, I think it had done very well. Like all things, it takes a bit of correction. So I think, you know, certainly with a more dovish kind of Fed and the interest rate the French shows and maybe the currency because I, I know it hasn't done so greatly kind of stabilizing, this could actually be kind of helpful for anybody's going forward. And just before we let you go, I want to talk about China as well, of course, dealing with, well, pretty deeply embedded deflation problem here. Do you feel the IOC and the government are doing enough to get on top of this? I mean, if you focus in and actually where the deflation is really happening, because we were looking inside the some of the data point in things like hotel domestic flights, they're actually being okay in terms of real nominal growth. The area that has really been a big drag on the economy has been manufacturing oversupply. And I think some of these policies where the government is dealing with involution and involution and and making sure that these excess supply, you know, and the funding that from the central and local governments are being kind of dealt with, that hopefully over time that we start to kind of remove some of those excess supply that actually would help deal with really with the well focused deflationary problem within China. We've seen the yuan strengthening gradually all throughout this year. Do you see that trend being allowed to continue? I think look, probably at these levels that kind of happy with it. I mean, this thing now depends also on on the US leg of it. But I think what's happening here there is concerted action is there's a lot of concern that, you know, has the Chinese stock market going to fall. But I think again, you have to look at sectors. There are certain sectors that are going to be benefiting from these, you know, much more kind of supply side policies that will actually still benefit. And I think on the tech side of things, yeah, it has come up quite a lot. But if you look at the supply chain, the supply chain, China still is very, very well. Asia in general is actually still very, very critical to the infrastructure and the hardware that we need to to kind of move on with the kind of revolution that we're seeing. Yeah. All right. To her China of Rebecca. Thanks so much for joining us today with your insights. Let's just take a look at how a few key assets are tracking at the moment. Doing a check in on cryptocurrencies. We did see Ether surging for a record the first time. It's hit a record in almost four years. So this is, of course, the world's second largest cryptocurrency, so enjoying a bounce in demand. We also saw Bitcoin rallying on Friday and this is after remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell. He did open the door to that interest rate cut in September as we were discussing those remarks there at Jackson Hole. So we've got Bitcoin now off that record of 124,500, but still higher on those remarks. So the reaction for the crypto market been pretty. Welcome back. You're watching inside. China is proposing new rules to regulate Internet platform pricing, making a major shift aimed at curbing unfair practices and boosting transparency. The draft also covers platform behavior, big data use and coordination between regulators, industry groups and tech firms. Let's get to Beijing and our China correspondent, Ben Menlow, sometime and tell us more about the new rules. Yes, Paul. These rules are meant to benefit consumers because one of the rules, for example, would prevent these platform companies from charging different prices to different consumers by making use of the data that they get from consumers regarding their ability and willingness to pay. The consumption patterns and habits in the past to price discriminate. And this comes after market regulators back in May also came up with a new set of proposed rules governing the commissions and fees charged by these platform companies to margins as well. And the goal, I guess, is to promote to protect consumers and small and medium and small size enterprises that are using these platforms, given that they are already, of course, seeing profits thinning because of the consumption slowdown in these smaller companies, they are the main source of new employment at a time when China is seeking seeing unemployment tick up as well. So the government is cracking down on, you know, the the big platform companies, preventing them from abusing their positions of power to ensure that the smaller players are able to do well in the economy as well. We've also seen Chinese stocks extending their bull run. And this is even though we're seeing some signs of weakness in the economy, are there any concerns about how enduring this rally is going to be? Yeah, this is pretty interesting. I mean, I was checking this morning to turnover within the first couple of hours, had already topped \u00a51.4 trillion and we had seen several days now of turnover topping \u00a52 trillion. That's exceeding the level that we have seen around a deep sea moment. And we continue to see this really taking place in China, which, as you said, is quite jarring given the divergence between what's happening in equity markets versus what's happening in the real economy. Because you look at the credit data, the housing data, the activity data, all of that showing signs of slowdown, not to mention the deflationary pressures because producers price index had been in decline for 34 straight months. CPI was flat last month. And so some traders are concerned that given this deflationary cycle, it's impossible for the rally to gather steam in a sustainable way. So there has been, you know, different opinions so far, according to economists, that we have in speaking to some like Morgan Stanley, I say they're still late to run. They're saying this rally could last through the summer because a lot of retail investors are still on the sidelines. So far, the rally has been driven by high net worth individuals, cash rich clients and hedge funds as well. A lot of the money are rotating into equities because the bond market is not giving a lot of returns given the low interest rate environment. And when retail investors start to participate in a big way, then we could see more upside to that rally. Of course, it's raising concern about whether we will see a bubble bursting at some point. And, you know, really harking back to what happened in 2015. But at that time, the bubble burst when China, the government actually tried to rein in leveraged investing. And some traders are saying that this time, because it's such a slow ball, perhaps that's what the government wants, especially if it can create a wealth effect and translate into better consumer spending in the real economy. Maybe the government will not do too much to burst that bubble this time. All right. Bloomberg's China correspondent in Menlo that well, let's get some more on the outlook for China's domestic consumption and how that's all playing out in the markets. Get some insights from Martin Sorrell, founder and executive chairman of S4 Capital. His business focuses on the digital advertising market across more than 30 countries. And thanks so much for joining us today. I just want to pick up on some of those points that amendment was making there. So we've got China grappling with a bunch of issues right now deflation, U.S. tariffs, an uncertain trade environment. Never mind all of that. The the markets rallying hard. Do you think this has got legs or is there some risk of a correction here? No, I'm not a stock market expert on China, But do I think the Chinese economy has got legs? Certainly I do. I mean, they're not doing too badly. If you're with the or you believe the the the government statistics are still growing at around 5% a year which we in the UK would give are right arm for us obviously has been strong but not not as strong as China and China. China's economy is about $18 trillion in terms of GDP in the US about 28 trillion. So those two two engines actually despite the stock market issues, despite the real estate problems, despite the sui borrowing at a local level, not at the federal level in China. Despite those three problems, the Chinese economy is fine. Despite tariffs. The Chinese, to my mind, are already sort of flipping their trade policy. When we were in Beijing just before the American election talking to government officials, it was clear, although they weren't were clear at that time, whether Trump would be elected in the way that he was and was going to impose tariffs in the way that he has. Certainly they were talking about the the change in Chinese outbound exports and shifting from a a US directed effort to a more fragmented effort around the world. I mean, if you look at that, those GDP statistics of the US and China account for about 46 trillion out of 106 of their 60 trillion outside those two markets, which China is very much focused on, that's Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the rest of Asia. So I think the Chinese economy will remain strong. You know, there is that Chinese meme on social media that said Trump is making China great again, so that the Chinese, I think, have got the between their teeth. It's what I call the Weiwei strategy. If you remember, Weiwei was next in the US and the UK. So what did they do? They shifted their approach to looking at those developing. Markets, as I mentioned, the other thing to bear in mind is the the E7 in terms of GDP is bigger than the G7, and you exclude China from the G7 and the US from the G7. The six is still bigger than the G6. From a GDP point of view. So what you're seeing is a change in the world order, which America obviously finds difficult to accommodate and accept, particularly on the the right side of the political spectrum. And that's what I think we're seeing. So BRICS next 11 Global South are becoming relatively more important. America will remain a dominant economy for a number of years, but the Chinese are certainly catching up. You mentioned that the Huawei moment and maybe we're seeing a deep sneak one as well when it comes to Asia. And I want to talk about AI in a moment. Yeah, but you mentioned the strength of China's economy, despite despite despite I want to throw another respite in there, and that's the consumer as well. Who's the sentiment? Somewhat weak. And it's sparking a pretty fierce price war among a number of China's consumer facing businesses as well. What kind of pressures do you anticipating building up here? Well, consumption has always been an issue in really in relation to the Chinese economy. It's always been an export driven economy and consumption versus savings. I mean, you save for the future, you save for health, you save for the family. And that's always been a big issue in the Chinese context. So I wouldn't say it's an issue that is a new one. And really the Chinese economy is export driven. And I think the basic point for us in the West to understand is they will change their trade flows. You already see it actually in the May and June numbers after Liberation Day after President Trump imposed these tariffs. You're already starting to see Chinese outbound shift. And the Chinese are very, very adept at shifting their supply chain patterns to accommodate changes in policy, very agile. You know, the West and Western companies often talk about agility. Chinese companies practice it. It's an art in relation to Chinese goods. And what we're seeing, we have a operation in Shanghai, very successful last year in the IT industry in China. But what we're seeing is a tremendous emphasis and drive on outbound Chinese. I was in Seoul in Korea just a week before last and same thing there. I mean, you're seeing Korean companies start to look at the world in a different way. I mean, we've gone into a new era. Growth is going to be more difficult to find. Worldwide growth rates are going to be less than 3% rather than above 3%. Inflation is stubborn, you know, despite the chairman of the Fed announcing that rates are likely to to fall the level of rates because inflation UK is still 3.8%, the US is still 3% because inflation is still up. They're certainly above the level that the the Fed, the banks, the central banks would like to see of around 2%. Despite that, what we're seeing is higher interest rates. Would we be used to in a higher inflation? We used to in that world growth is going to be more difficult to come by and therefore people are looking at the world in a very different way and the growth areas will remain. The US, Latin America, the Middle East and a pack. Africa is too volatile, Europe is too slow growth. Can I talk about another growth area as well, which is more sector specific? And you know, my promise we will get to I mean, you're bullish on development, but there's questions about how all of this gets monetized because we've seen a huge amount of investment, not a great deal of return on investment. Where's this heading? Well, you're starting to see in our industry we're seeing very significant developments around visualization and copywriting, and that's compressing the time it makes, it takes to make ads and the cost of those ads. Secondly, we're seeing very significant growth in personalization of advertising at huge scale driven by AI. We're seeing media planning and buying. We're $1,000,000,000,000 industry, 700 billion in digital, 300 billion traditional. We're seeing media planning and buying beginning becoming fully algorithmic, very similar to the investing industry. You know, you don't choose to distribute an investment portfolio between property, between equity, private equity. Crypto gold, whatever. Other than through algorithmic analysis, same thing applies to us. Fourth area is general efficiency, and the fifth area is the democratization of knowledge. So A.I. is starting to have a huge effect. But going back to our clients, they are very focused on the geopolitical risks around US-China relations or lack of them very focused around what's happening with Russia and Ukraine and Russia's territorial ambitions, very focused on Iran and its proxies in the Middle East that is causing significant turbulence. You leg tariffs on top of that, a lot of uncertainty. Once we know where the level of tariffs plays out, I think what you're then going to see is in that world, which is growing more slowly, a huge focus on finding where the growth is and a huge focus on efficiency is very interesting. Since the terrorists have been imposed, what we've seen is client margins be maintained. I mean, it's early days, but in Q2 and going into Q3, the projections for client margins remain pretty strong for the S & P 500 where they have been and the forecast for the margins to actually improve into 26. For that to happen, you have to implement technology at scale. So whilst in our own case, the only big client that we've seen implement AI at huge scale from a marketing point of view would be General Motors. I think what you'll start to see is companies start to implement quite aggressively because going into 26 in order to maintain growth and more importantly growth in margins and profitability, they are going to have to be more efficient in that slower growth world. Yep. All right. Martin Sorrell of S4 Capital, we'll have to leave it there. But thanks so much for joining us today. Thank you very much. The company does desire to tech CEO Natasha mitchell saying it's going to be here to discuss the impact on business as India seeks to ban online games that are encouraging gambling with real money. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back here watching inside. India has moved forward with legislation to ban online gambling, citing rising instances of addiction, money laundering and financial fraud linked to these apps. Joining us now is Natasha mitchell Hossain, CEO and Joint Managing Director of Nazara Technologies, which holds a stake in the online poker platform Poker Barzee. Natasha, thanks so much for joining us. So what's your plan for this, a stake in poker? Barzee. What's the plan? Yes, I think it's been a surprise move last week. Important to understand it in India, to know, you know, gambling and gaming and, you know, state wise law. And there's a distinction that's been there for games of skill versus games of chance. But the last week the government came up with the third nationwide bill that, you know, banned all games for stakes, not a game of skill or game of chance. And I think that puts platforms such as Poker, Bazi or, you know, fantasy sports platforms like Dream11 at significant risk. Obviously, all platforms have, you know, complied with the law and paused their services at this point of time. Mm hmm. So what are you going to do with your stake in poker? BARZEE Are you going to divest or do you have something else in mind? I think it's early days. The teams that are looking at how they can pivot the business and how they can adapt to the new reality, someone who's out of perspective, obviously, we will have to evaluate, you know, the extent of investment and any potential write offs or impairments that we may need to ascribe as part the accounting standards. So you say it's going to take some time. Do you have a timeframe in mind? Is it days, weeks, months before you make a decision? I think it's likely that we will take an early decision, maybe Q2 and Q3 of this year. Lazaro usually, you know, follows a very conservative accounting standard and therefore we will take whatever appropriate conservative outlook for this particular business. This is important, of course, to understand that we don't have any real money gaming revenues, that we consolidate on our business. And therefore, due to this particular band, no revenues or operational profitability of NAZARA gets impacted whatsoever. As you're speaking there, we're we're seeing a chart of the impact on the share price. I mean, it's all getting on for 18% in the past three days. When this decision was taken on year, though, it's still higher by 10%. What's the message you'd like to communicate to investors? I think Nazara is the India's most diversified gaming platform, with 70% global revenues, pretty strong core gaming APIs. We've been around for 25 years. We're a profitable cash flow generating company with close to no debt and nearly $100 million of cash on our balance sheet. So I think we are probably thought of as India's only listed gaming company, probably best placed to take advantage of this disruption in the industry and carry on with what we do with. As you were mentioning it a moment ago, that you're not expecting to see too much of a significant impact on the Zara's bottom line here. But what how about in terms of expansion plans that this has these have the new regulations caused a rethink and or change of strategy? No, I think on the positive side, there was a lot of positive commentary and regulation around e-sports in which there is a market leader in India as well as casual gaming. So I think that will create massive opportunities for Nazara in the next months and years to come. In addition to our existing business strategy, which does not get impacted beyond its stake in both us. There were some concerns expressed by others that this ban is just simply going to drive users to illegal offshore betting operators. Do you have any thoughts on that? Do you feel, you know, it's better to keep the business onshore but regulated? Yes, I think definitely there will be you know, users will be driven offshore. And I think the government does plan to come down very heavily on these offshore activities. So I'm hopeful that if this ban has been put in place, then the offshore activities will be restricted significantly. Otherwise, it's a lose lose for all parties concerned. Do you anticipate any job losses in the industry as a result of the ban on real money online gambling? Yes, of course. It's important to understand that, you know, 80% of India's revenues are coming from skill based gaming, not gambling. And that obviously is going to result in significant job losses. But I guess that's something that's par for the course at this point of time. You mentioned a moment ago that the bill also recognizes e-sports as a sport and the opportunities around this. Is this your key focus for growth now and what else are you looking at? Soon as our primary business is called gaming IP, such as Caterpillar, Animal Jam, Love Island, etc.. Big Brother No, we've implies a Big Brother game globally, so I think that is our core business. We see that plus publishing in India has very large opportunities in addition to our e-sports business. So key strategic focus area is going forward. So nazara though, and India more broadly. While this industry is growing, you still do lag behind some of the giants such as Tencent when it comes to producing world class mobile games. What are you doing to do you see them? Do you see you potentially joining their ranks one day? Of course, we will surely do that in the next few years to come. India's gaming industry is obviously a little late to the party, but it's important to understand that this is going to be the fastest growing gaming industry for the next decade to come. Totally. And it's going to be a very exciting space. We already have 500 million gamers, most of them on mobile. And India already tops the charts when it comes to the number of games downloaded every year. However, monetization has lagged and has a propensity to pay for games increases. I think India will be right on top it and companies like Nazara should emerge as global leaders. How competitive is the market in India at the moment? You know, it's obviously a huge market. It's a growing market as well. Is there space for more competition or is competition fierce at the moment? And what are you doing to stay ahead of your competitors? I think a lot of the competition is skilled and focused towards turning on many gaming space, which has taken a big setback. So I think the battle right now for Azaria is very clear. Like I mentioned earlier, we are India's only listed gaming company with significant credibility, and I think we can bring a lot of global partners and partnerships into India to grow this business together. All right, Natasha and Mr. Assange CEO, and join me at Nazara Technologies, which of course has felt some impact after the Indian government passed that bill banning the promotion and operation of online money gaming apps. The plan to deal with its stake in a poker bazaar still in the works and intention to take a look at that in the coming quarters. Let's take a look at Indian markets, how they're tracking at the moment. We have seen, of course, as you would expect, Nazara Technologies taking a little bit of a hit as the result of that. That's an understatement. Down about 18% in three days over the course of the year, though, doing okay. And it's a reasonably risk positive day in India today as well. We got the Sensex and indeed all of the major indexes up by about a quarter of 1% mirroring what was seen across much of the Asia Pacific today. As of course a risk on tone out there after we received some reasonably dovish comments from Fed Chair Jay Powell at the conclusion of the Jackson Hole retreats in Wyoming. We're looking ahead now to the next Fed decision mid-September. And the consensus is we're going to see 25 basis points of easing positive day for Indian markets. Some of the stocks there that are moving. Also tracking some changes in the nifty index as well. Interglobe Aviation, Max, health care, that's set to join the benchmark at the end of the month as part of the semi-annual review. The additions reflecting shifts in demographics and rising consumption in the in the bank and hero Motocorp going to be leaving the index to make room for those newcomers. Before we go, here's a preview of tomorrow's show. Javelin wealth management partner Polke Mishra is going to be joining us live for market analysis.

Even preceding your tenure, you have stakes in a lot of AV companies. Yes. Talked recently about wanting to monetize some of those. What's the strategy? So we want to essentially support the AV ecosystem and continue to help that ecosystem develop and then Avs penetrate into the marketplace. AV we think represents a safer way of transportation. Ultimately, we think it will expand the marketplace as it makes kind of safe transportation cities available to everybody. So we're big fans of the and generally we're working with multiple partners in the ecosystem. Waymo, for example, in Austin and Atlanta, coming up, Wave AV ride, there are probably 18 partnerships that we have in the ecosystem and we want to help these players develop by investing in them in in some cases, but really by working with them to bring their product to market. These are technologies that are unbelievably promising, but they've taken billions of dollars to develop and, you know, ten plus years. And it's one of those overnight successes that's kind of taken 20 years of of development, but is finally ready to hit a market. And we want to help the ecosystem get there.

  "summary": "Fed Chair Jay Powell has hinted that a rate cut may be needed for September due to the shifting balance of risks and the stability of the unemployment rate and other labour market measures. Despite this, he remains cautious about further reductions in interest rates. His comments have been met with cheers from markets and jeers from President Trump, who believes the easing cycle should have begun a year earlier. Concerns are also raised about potential political interference at the US Central Bank, with concerns about the potential removal of a Fed governor, Lisa Cook, who refuses to resign over mortgage fraud accusations. Meanwhile, China's stock markets rally is seen as shaky as consumers remain cautious, and Indian game developer Nazar Stock has lost almost 20% since the government's online gaming bill passed the lower House. Rebecca's head of fixed income for Asia, Martin Sorrell, also discusses the implications of this for the Fed.",
