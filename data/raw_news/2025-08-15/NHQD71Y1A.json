      "text": "\u201cApple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,\u201d the billionaire wrote on his X social media platform Monday (Aug. 11) evening.\nMusk added that xAI, his artificial intelligence (AI) company, \u201cwill take immediate legal action.\u201d\nAs of early Tuesday (Aug. 12) morning, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was the number one free app in the App store, with Grok, xAI\u2019s chatbot, sitting in the number six position. A report on the matter by Reuters notes that ChatGPT also holds the top spot among apps in Google\u2019s app store.\n\u201cHey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your \u2018Must Have\u2019 section when X is the #1 news app in the world\u2026Are you playing politics? What gives?\u201d Musk wrote in an earlier post.\nPYMNTS has contacted Apple for comment but has not yet gotten a reply.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Musk has clashed with Apple over its relationship with OpenAI. After Apple said it would integrate ChatGPT into its operating system last year, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies, which also include Tesla and Starlink.\nAnd if Musk makes good on his threat to sue, it would add to a list of legal troubles for Apple related to the App Store.\nA federal judge ruled in April that the company had violated a court order \u2014 in its ongoing legal battle with Epic Games \u2014 that required it to allow more competition in the App Store. The ruling also referred Apple to prosecutors for a possible criminal contempt probe. Apple has said it would appeal the decision.\nWriting about this decision last month, PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster said the ruling placed a \u201cbig blinking asterisk\u201d on the $20 billion profit engine that is the App Store.\n\u201cThe Epic ruling puts this once untouchable revenue stream at risk and gives developers legitimate ways to avoid paying the Apple commission,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cSpotify and Netflix and Amazon already use their newfound right to steer users off-platform to sign up. Stripe has published a playbook to show developers how, which suggests a giant sucking sound may follow. Apple\u2019s grip on its ecosystem profits is slipping.\u201d\nAlso in April, the tech giant was fined 500 million euros ($587 million) fine by the European Commission \u2014 Europe\u2019s competition watchdog. The commission found that Apple\u2019s rules kept app developers from guiding users to cheaper offers outside the App Store in violation of the Digital Markets Act. Apple is appealing that ruling as well, calling it \u201cunlawful.\u201d"

      "text": "ChatGPT\u2019s mobile app is raking in the revenue.\nSince launching in May 2023, ChatGPT\u2019s app for iOS and Android devices has reached $2 billion in global consumer spending, according to a new analysis by app intelligence provider Appfigures. That figure is approximately 30x the combined lifetime spending of ChatGPT\u2019s rivals on mobile, including Claude, Copilot, and Grok, the analysis indicates.\nSo far this year, ChatGPT\u2019s mobile app has made $1.35 billion, up 673% year-over-year from the $174 million it made during the same period (January-July) in 2024, per the data. On average, the app is generating close to $193 million per month, up from $25 million last year.\nThat\u2019s significantly higher \u2014 or about 53x higher \u2014 than ChatGPT\u2019s next nearest competitor, Grok, which made approximately $25.6 million this year to date. Grok\u2019s average monthly consumer spending is estimated at $3.6 million, or 1.9% of ChatGPT\u2019s.\nThis data suggests that other consumer chatbots still have a way to go to catch up with ChatGPT\u2019s dominance on mobile devices, even if the numbers don\u2019t provide a complete picture of the AI companies\u2019 overall revenue. Consumers, teams, and businesses can also subscribe to AI plans on the web, and the companies generate revenue in other ways, too, like via their APIs.\nRather, this new data offers a window into the apps\u2019 traction with consumers, who discover and pay for these AI assistants via the mobile app stores.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that when xAI\u2019s Grok launched in November 2023 (after ChatGPT), Grok didn\u2019t initially have stand-alone iOS or Android apps. Instead, users interacted with the AI chatbot through the X platform. Grok only became available on mobile devices through its own iOS app as of early January 2025 and has been on Google Play since March 4.\nStill, ChatGPT\u2019s lifetime global spending per download is $2.91, compared to Claude\u2019s $2.55, Grok\u2019s $0.75, and Copilot\u2019s $0.28, Appfigures found.\nIn the U.S., ChatGPT\u2019s spending per download to date is even higher, at $10, leading the market to account for 38% of the app\u2019s revenue to date. Germany is the second-largest market, accounting for 5.3% of ChatGPT\u2019s lifetime total spending.\nChatGPT\u2019s lead can also be seen in terms of downloads. To date, the app has been installed an estimated 690 million times globally, compared with Grok\u2019s 39.5 million. (That puts X owner Elon Musk\u2019s recent complaints about the App Store\u2019s alleged favoritism of ChatGPT in its Top Charts into better context.)\nAverage monthly downloads of ChatGPT globally are now at approximately 45 million, up 180% from about 16 million in January through July of 2024.\nIn 2025 so far, ChatGPT\u2019s app has been downloaded 318 million times, or 2.8x more than the 113 million it saw during the same period last year. By the number of installs, however, India is the top market, accounting for 13.7% of lifetime downloads, compared with second place, the U.S., which accounted for 10.3% of all downloads."
