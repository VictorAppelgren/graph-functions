  "title": "MacBook Air deal: The M4-powered laptop is on sale for as low as $799",
  "description": "Both the 13- and 15-inch models are cheaper than ever.",
  "content": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nWhether you need a new MacBook for the upcoming semester or you've just been itching to upgrade from an older machine, now's a good time to buy. Amazon has a sale on the latest M4 MacBook Air that knocks up to 20 percent off many configurations.\n\nThe base model is where you'll get the biggest discount. The 16GB RAM/256GB SSD laptop is down to $799 from $999, which is the lowest price we've seen. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999, down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399.\n\nThen there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4, whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade, which is $1,399, down from $1,599.\n\nWe're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review. Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video.\n\nThe big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.\n\nCheck out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.",

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best deals on MacBooks, AirPods, iPads and other Apple gear you can get right now\nYou can score a few record-low prices on some of the latest Apple devices.\nIt goes without saying that Apple devices tend to be fairly high-quality \u2014 the company's gear currently occupies the top spots in several of our buying guides, from laptops and tablets to smartphones and smartwatches. As a result, that gear usually doesn't come cheap. But that doesn\u2019t mean you always have to pay full price. Good Apple deals are often out there, so long as you know where to look.\nTo make things easier, we're keeping a running list of the best Apple deals you can shop right now on AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Just note that you\u2019ll almost always find the best Apple deals from third-party retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target and the like, not from Apple's own online store. Unless you shop refurbished, you\u2019ll usually pay top dollar buying direct (though for some items like iPhones, that might be the best route to take).\nBest iPad deals\nThe latest iPad Air is a relatively minor update; the only big addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend this iPad over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple\u2019s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. (Though both will benefit from the many changes coming with iPadOS 26.) This $150 discount is an all-time low and applies to each color and storage configuration. Also at Best Buy and Target.\nApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nathan Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is another new low, and again, all color and storage configs are on sale.\nApple iPad Pro (13-inch, M4) for $1,099 ($200 off): The most powerful iPad is the iPad Pro. Both the 11- and 13-inch models have gorgeous 120Hz OLED displays, thinner and lighter designs, a repositioned front camera and the excessively powerful M4 chip inside. This 13-inch version is pricey, but it may be worth the extra cost if you plan to multitask regularly or just want more screen space for enjoying movies. While this isn't the absolute largest discount we've seen, it's a solid drop all the same. Be aware, though, that reports have said that Apple could release a new iPad Pro by the end of the year. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nApple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip \u2014 which is enough to support Apple Intelligence \u2014 along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you\u2019d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target and Best Buy.\nBest MacBook deals\nApple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major refresh overall, but that's not a bad thing \u2014 the design remains exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This drop ties an all-time low for base config with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD to a new low. Models with more memory or storage are also $200 off. Also at Best Buy.\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked.\nApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,199 ($500 off): The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while stock remains available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review \u2014 outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with the larger 24GB of memory in the Starlight colorway.\nBest AirPods deals\nIf you don't need active noise cancellation, you can grab Apple's most affordable earbuds, the AirPods 4 without ANC. These came out last September at the same time as the latest iPhone. Engadget's Billy Steele reviewed them and appreciated their comfort, improved sound quality and advanced features like voice isolation for calls and Personalized Spatial Audio. This deal is $10 more than the pair's all-time low. Also at Walmart.\nApple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 ($80 off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple\u2019s best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid, though their six-hour battery life still isn\u2019t the best, and you should only get them if you\u2019re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that\u2019s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. This deal is $20 off the all-time low we saw last month, but it's still a ways below the set's usual going rate. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Exercise caution, though: If you're not in a rush, this is another Apple device that may see a refresh within the next couple of months.\nBest Apple Watch deals\nFor now, Apple\u2019s flagship wearable remains the best smartwatch you can buy. While the Series 10 is an iterative update, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. It sports a slightly longer battery life, a slimmer design and wide-angle OLED screen for better viewing angles. It still tracks workouts accurately and delivers alerts to your wrist efficiently, though we will almost certainly see a new Series 11 model by the end of the year if you're not in any rush. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.\nApple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off): Apple\u2019s most premium smartwatch, the Ultra 2 has a killer 36-hour battery life, a handy Low Power mode for extended use and cellular connectivity by default. It also has a compass app, water temperature gauge and a loud onboard siren that you can trigger in emergencies. This discount marks the lowest price we've tracked. But again, we wouldn't be surprised if Apple introduced an updated model in the coming weeks.\nApple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) for $169 ($80 off): As with the more premium models, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see an update to Apple\u2019s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Target.\nBest Apple accessories deals\nThe highest-end option in Apple\u2019s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and support for Apple\u2019s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It\u2019s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it\u2019s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a decent discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart and Best Buy.\nApple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off): This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn\u2019t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you\u2019re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you\u2019ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Walmart and Best Buy.\nRead more Apple coverage:\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best laptops for college students\nOur favorite machines for classes on campus, online and everywhere in between.\nThere's arguably no piece of tech more important for a college student than a good laptop. Whether you\u2019re working on an essay, doing research for a paper or just need some downtime streaming your favorite show, a solid laptop for college is an investment that can (and should) last you for years. While the best laptops come in all shapes and sizes and range in price, college students don\u2019t need a power-hungry machine or a notebook with the latest graphics card to get things done. For most, the best laptop for college is ideally thin and lightweight, and provides enough battery to last all day without having to be tethered to the wall. No matter what you\u2019re studying, we\u2019ve researched and tested a range of laptops for you to consider as you decide which is the best laptop for college for you.\nWhat to consider in your next laptop for college\nIt\u2019s important to consider your major and what you need your laptop to do before deciding on the best laptop for college. For example, if you\u2019re a liberal arts major and will mostly be writing or making presentations, you don\u2019t need an expensive system with a discrete graphics card. Alternatively, if you\u2019re a film major who might need to render videos on a regular basis, having a beefy PC can significantly reduce the time it takes to finish a project. You\u2019ll also want to take a look at any guidelines provided by your college or your specific program, as you may need required software or apps that only run on a specific OS.\nSome other things to consider are if you want a more portable 13 or 14-inch machine that\u2019s easier to carry around, or if you prefer something with a larger screen. On top of that, if you are doing tasks like photo or video editing, you\u2019ll probably want to go for a system with a high-resolution display (1440p or 4K), so it's easier to see details. As for other specs, ideally you\u2019ll want 16GB of RAM (though you can go down to 8GB on a Chromebook) and at least 512GB or 1TB of storage. Most newer laptops now come with SSD storage, too, which means you can store and transfer data much faster.\nFinally, while your budget ultimately will determine how powerful of a laptop you can get, well-equipped ultraportables will generally cost between $1,000 and $1,400, with prices going up from there for systems with discrete GPUs. Budget Windows laptops and Chromebooks can be affordable alternatives though, with many going for just $500 to $700. But again, remember to check your school\u2019s requirements because it\u2019s not worth saving a few bucks only to find out that your notebook can\u2019t run the app you need for all your homework.\nSee Also:\nThe best laptops for college students\nRead our full Apple MacBook Air M4 review\nScreen size: 13.6 inches | Installed memory: 16GB | Drive capacity: Up to 2TB | Graphics processor: 10-core GPU | Available ports: MagSafe 4 charging port, 3.5mm headphone jack, 2x Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports | Battery life: 18 hours | Refresh rate: 60Hz | Max supported RAM: 24GB\nApple\u2019s M4-equipped 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air remain the best ultraportables you can buy today, and now they\u2019re also better deals starting at $999 and $1,199, respectively. That\u2019s $100 off the previous generation, but it\u2019s no knock on the quality of these laptops.\nBoth MacBook Air models remain remarkably fast, incredibly thin and light, and deliver excellent battery life. They\u2019re basically everything you\u2019d want in a premium productivity notebook. Sure, it would be nice to see more than two USB-C ports and a screen that\u2019s faster than 60Hz, but most buyers likely won\u2019t notice these deficiencies. (And if they really bug you, you can always consider the 14-inch MacBook Pro.)\nWhile the MacBook Air\u2019s design hasn\u2019t changed from the 2022-era M2 model, it\u2019s still attractive today, and it also holds up well against Windows ultraportables. The Air isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s fastest computer, but it\u2019s one of the company\u2019s most iconic machines, one that\u2019s elegantly crafted in ways that PC makers rarely accomplish. Its smooth metal case still feels great to hold, and its thin and light design makes it easy to travel with. The 2.7-pound 13-inch Air still feels impressively sturdy for its weight, and the 3.2-pound 15-inch model doesn\u2019t feel that much heavier. (And for many, the larger screen is worth the portability sacrifice.)\nBoth MacBook Air models lasted for well over 18 hours in our tests, so they\u2019ll likely last you two work days without needing to be juiced up. And while they\u2019re far from gaming PCs, we were still impressed to see them run the graphically intensive game Lies of P at 60fps in 1080p. \u2014 Devindra Hardawar, Senior Reporter\n- Fast performance\n- Thin and light design\n- Great keyboard\n- Best-in-class touchpad\n- Excellent battery life\n- Could use more ports\n- Screen is only 60Hz\nScreen size: 14.5 inches | Installed memory: Up to 32GB | Drive capacity: Up to 1TB | Graphics processor: Intel Core Ultra 7 | Available ports: 3x Thunderbolt 4, 1x microSD card slot, 1x audio jack | Battery life: Up to 8.5 hours (as tested) | Refresh rate: 120Hz | Max supported RAM: 32GB\nRead our full Dell 14 Premium review\nFor 2025, Dell rebranded the XPS 14 into the 14 Premium and gave it some updated specs. And while its new name is a shame, its pedigree remains unsullied (at least for now), which allows Dell's flagship 14-inch laptop to retain its title as one of the best Windows notebooks around. It features a slick, futuristic design with a hidden touchpad and love-or-hate-it multimedia controls along with solid performance, good enough battery life and welcome optional upgrades like a 3.2K OLED display and a discrete RTX 4050 GPU. So if you're looking for a portable and well-rounded Windows PC, it's hard to go wrong with the Dell 14 Premium. \u2014 Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter\n- Sleek design\n- Vivid optional OLED display\n- Solid performance\n- Giant touchpad\n- Divisive capacitive touch buttons\n- Optional discrete GPU is one generation old\nRead our full ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 review\nScreen size: 14 inches | Installed memory: 32GB | Drive capacity: 1TB | Graphics processor: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 | Available ports: 1x HDMI 2.1, 1x Thunderbolt 4, 2x USB-A 3.2, 1x USB-C 3.2 | Battery life: 10 hours | Refresh rate: 120Hz | Max supported RAM: 64GB\nFor the student who wants a new laptop that\u2019s light enough to carry to class but powerful enough to edit videos or play games at night, ASUS\u2019 ROG Zephyrus G14 offers an incredible combination of performance and portability, which is why it's one of our top picks for the best gaming laptops. It features a gorgeous 120Hz OLED display, an AMD Ryzen 9 AI chip and up to NVIDIA RTX 5080 graphics, which is more than enough to handle almost anything you can throw at it \u2014 and a definite plus if you\u2019re a gamer.\nThe 2025 model also sports a sophisticated design with a single row of white LEDs across its lid instead of a bunch of RGB lights, a ton of ports (including a full-size HDMI jack and microSD slot) and better-than-average battery life. All of this comes in an unibody aluminum chassis that weighs just 3.3 pounds, which is the same as a 15-inch MacBook Air. Put simply, the ROG G14 is one of the best laptops in its class, which makes it a great choice for students that are dabbling in a bunch of different subjects or disciplines. Also, if you like the G14\u2019s mix of performance and design but want something a touch larger, there\u2019s the ROG Zephyrus G16 which supports up to an RTX 5090 GPU. \u2014 S.R.\nScreen size: 14 inches | Installed memory: 8GB | Drive capacity: 256GB | Graphics processor: Intel Graphics | Available ports: 2x Thunderbolt 4, 1x HDMI 2.0 | Battery life: 10 hours | Refresh rate: 60Hz | Max supported RAM: 16GB\nChromebooks may have started out as inexpensive PCs for early education and basic web browsing, but they\u2019ve matured a lot over the years. Recently, with the introduction of Google\u2019s Chromebook Plus designation, you can now get a number of handy AI-powered features from Google\u2019s operating system alongside improvements such as faster wake times, 1080p webcams and better battery life.\nOut of all the models on the market, Acer\u2019s Chromebook Plus Spin 714 is one of the few that supports a speedier Intel Core Ultra 5 chip with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of base storage (which is twice as much as many of its rivals). Meanwhile, thanks to its 360-degree hinge, you can use it as a standard clamshell or make use of its touchscreen as a tablet, depending on the situation. Finally, with a starting price of $700, it\u2019s more affordable than a typical Windows or Mac-based alternative. It's our current top pick for a premium device on our list of the best Chromebooks. \u2014 S.R."

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nApple MacBook Air M4 13-inch and 15-inch review: Minimal upgrades at a much better price\nNo surprises, but a lower $999 entry-level price is welcome.\nAt the risk of repeating myself from Engadget's MacBook Air M1, M2 and M3 reviews: The M4-equipped MacBook Air is a nearly flawless ultraportable. Even better, it now starts at $999, which is $100 less than before. While I'd still like to see more ports and a faster screen refresh rate, the MacBook Air still remains heads and shoulders above the competition. And when companies try to one-up Apple, as ASUS did with its 2.2-pound Zenbook A14, it only proves how much better-designed Apple's hardware actually is.\nIt's easy to take the MacBook Air for granted, since its design hasn't changed since the M2 model arrived in 2022. It's still a remarkable machine today, one that's fast, light and well-built. The only major downside is that there's a bit of a learning curve for Windows users jumping ship for the first time. But aside from that, the MacBook Air is a no-brainer purchase if you're looking for a new ultraportable.\nOnce again, Apple\u2019s MacBook Air is the ideal ultraportable for most users. It\u2019s slightly faster, thanks to the M4 chip, and also a bit cheaper with a new $999 starting price.\n- Fast performance\n- Thin and light design\n- Great keyboard\n- Best-in-class touchpad\n- Excellent battery life\n- Could use more ports\n- Screen is only 60Hz\nHardware\nOnce again, both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models feel impressively thin (measuring 0.44 inches thick) and light, weighing in at 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Last year, I noted \"Its unibody aluminum case feels as smooth a river stone yet as sturdy as a boulder. It's a computer I simply love to touch.\" All of that remains true with the M4 models.\nIn fact, it's even more impressive that Apple holds such a commanding design lead when competitors have had a chance to catch up. As much as we like the Surface Laptop, XPS 13 and ASUS' Zenbook S14, Apple still maintains a level of polish that PC makers can't quite match. The MacBook Air's case feels more luxurious than the rest, its keyboard is a dream to type on and it has one of the best trackpads around. (And before you go calling me an Apple fanboy, I'm still primarily a Windows desktop user.)\nApple's M4 chip \u2014 which sports a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU and 16-core Neural Engine (or what you'd call an NPU in a PC) \u2014 is the main upgrade with these new MacBook Airs. It's also worth noting that the base $999 13-inch model has a slightly slower 8-core GPU, which will slightly hamper gaming and media creation performance. Aside from a new Sky Blue option, there aren't any physical design changes. Apple also upgraded the webcam to a new 12-megapixel Center Stage shooter, which could be particularly helpful if you want to show off the contents of your desk. (More on that later.)\nThe 13-inch MacBook Air features a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display, which practically feels like a 14-inch screen, while the larger model has a 15.3-inch display. They're still limited to 60Hz \u2014 an annoyance since plenty of PC ultraportables are shipping with faster and smoother screens \u2014 but they're impressive displays nevertheless, with support for the P3 wide color gamut and 1 billion colors. Both screens can also reach up to 500 nits of brightness, which is enough to be usable on a sunny day.\nIn use: Fast and light\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs handled my basic workflow without a sweat: juggling browsers with a ton of open tabs, Slack, Spotify, messaging apps and the Pixelmator photo editor. But that was no surprise, as the previous models were similarly zippy. Still, after testing the sluggish Zenbook A14 recently, it felt refreshing to be using laptops that seemed eager to get to work.\nI couldn't actually feel a difference with the jump to the M4 chip, but according to the Geekbench 6 benchmark, it\u2019s 19.5 percent faster than the M3 for single-threaded tasks, and 21 percent faster for multi-threaded tasks. That's a typical incremental jump for CPU improvements, so I won't knock Apple too much there. The M4's GPU gains were far less impressive, scoring just 6 percent higher than the M3 in the 3DMark Wildlife Extreme benchmark and 16.3 percent better in the Geekbench GPU test.\nGeekbench 6 CPU | Geekbench 6 GPU | Cinebench 2024 | |\nApple MacBook Air 13-inch (M4, 2025) | 3,784/14,745 | 36,273 | 172/660 GPU: 3,465 |\nApple MacBook Air 15-inch (M4, 2025) | 3,874/14,873 | 36,131 | 171/748 GPU: 3897 |\nApple MacBook Air 13-inch (M3, 2024) | 3,190/12,102 | 30,561 | N/A |\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4, 2024) | 3,797/14,571 | 37,869 | 172/979 GPU: 3770 |\nSurface Laptop 7 (Snapdragon X Elite) | 2,797/14,400 | 19,963 | 123/969 GPU N/A |\nYou likely won't be doing much serious creative work on the MacBook Air, especially since there's no fan to cool things down. But you can still squeeze out a bit of performance in a pinch. I was able to transcode a 4K clip to 1080p in 27 seconds using the M4's CPU in Handbrake, while using the GPU took just 17 seconds. In comparison, the Dell XPS 13 Copilot+ system took 32 seconds with its CPU and 24 seconds with its GPU.\nThe graphically intense Lies of P ran at a smooth 60 fps in 1080p with high settings. That was also true of the M3 MacBook Air, but this time around the performance seemed a bit more consistent. While I'd never recommend buying a MacBook Air with gaming in mind, it's nice that it can handle a bit of playtime, at least.\nWhile jumping between the 13-inch and 15-inch models, I found a lot to like about them both. The smaller one is definitely easier to travel with, but I also loved the immersive screen on the 15-inch. Ultimately, choosing between them comes down to what's most important to you.\nSimilarly, the leap to a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera isn't exactly Earth-shattering, but I appreciated having a slightly better picture during video calls. I typically turn off the actual Center Stage feature on Macs, but I'm sure some will appreciate its ability to track you around a room. The new camera also supports Desk View, which projects a slightly skewed view of the area directly in front of the MacBook Air.\nAs for battery life, both MacBook Air models lasted for more than 18 hours while playing an HD video. The 13-inch Air lasted for 18 hours and 15 minutes, while the 15-inch notebook went for 18 hours and 23 minutes.\nHow can Apple improve the MacBook Air?\nAs much as I love the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air, there are still plenty of ways Apple can refine them down the line. As I mentioned above, it'd be great to have higher refresh rate displays, which makes scrolling through documents far easier on your eyes. And while I don't need Apple to go all-out with ports, it'd be nice to have at least one USB-C connection on the right side of the Air to allow for easier charging. Right now, you're stuck with a MagSafe charging port and two USB-C connections on the left side.\nOf course, I don't really expect Apple to actually deliver those upgrades anytime soon. I'd bet the company would nudge more demanding users to the $1,599 14-inch MacBook Pro, which has a ton of ports and a high refresh rate ProMotion screen. Still, a geek can dream.\nShould you buy the M4 MacBook Air?\nIf you can't tell by now, I think the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air are the ideal ultraportables for most people. So sure, if you're in the market for a sleek laptop, they're worth considering. And if you're a Windows user who's hesitant to make the jump, I'd recommend trying an Air for a while. It's not that hard to learn the basics of macOS, and if you're not satisfied you can always return it (just be sure to double-check retailer return policies).\nWhile I'd bet most users would be fine with the base $999 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage, it may be worth jumping up to the $1,199 model with a 10-core GPU and 512GB SSD if you plan to do light media work. Or just jump straight to the $1,199 15-inch model, which comes with a 10-core GPU.\nAs usual, I'd also recommend avoiding paying Apple's absurd upgrade fees for components. If you're considering spending $400 more for 32GB of RAM, you should probably be considering a MacBook Pro instead. If you're looking to save some cash, several retailers are still selling the M2 MacBook Air at a steep discount of $700. Even though it's an older chip, that laptop could still serve most users well for several years (just make sure you're getting 16GB of RAM).\nWrap-up\nOnce again, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air are basically everything we want from ultraportable notebooks. They\u2019re zippy, wonderfully light and can last well beyond a full day of work. While the M4 chip isn\u2019t a transformative upgrade, it helps Apple keep pace with evolving PC notebook chips. And now that the MacBook Air starts at $999, even Windows users should consider making the jump."
