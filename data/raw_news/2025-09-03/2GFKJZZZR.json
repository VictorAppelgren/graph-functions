  "content": "Top of New Hydrothermal System Identified in Diatreme Breccia OTTAWA, ON, Sept. 3, 2025 /CNW/ - Northern Shield Resources Inc. (\"Northern Shield\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV: NRN) is pleased to provide an update on exploration at Root & Cellar Property (\"Root & Cellar\" or the \"Property\"), on the Burin Peninsula in southeastern Newfoundland. The Property, being explored for epithermal gold mineralization and associated porphyry copper systems, includes 5 gold-mineralized zones over a 6 km strike-length. Tellurium (Te), a critical metal, is associated with four of the showings and also with copper mineralization. Figure 1. Photo showing hydrothermal mill breccia cutting diatreme breccia. Disseminated pyrite (light coloured flecks) are seen throughout the sample. Inset shows diatreme breccia with abundant rhyolite, rhyolite porphyry and lesser basaltic fragments with disseminated pyrite. (CNW Group/Northern Shield Resources Inc.) Assays from drill core samples are still pending, with complete results expected in a few more weeks.\n\u2022 Two mineralized occurrences have been discovered in large quarry pits in the Creston Copper Zone, located to the southwest of the Conquest Zone. The quarries are operated for producing road aggregate with recent expansion of the pits, both laterally and to depth, exposing the mineralization in a hybrid, hydrothermal-magmatic [diatreme], breccia.\n\u2022 In the southernmost pit, disseminated pyrite occurs in the matrix, fragments of breccia, and in cross-cutting hydrothermal mill breccias (Figure 1). Trace sphalerite (zinc sulphide) and molybdenite was also observed in the area.\n\u2022 Approximately 300 m to the NNE, a hydrothermal breccia, within the diatreme breccia, was discovered in rock recently blasted from the quarry floor. It exhibits various phases of chalcedonic silica fragments (Figure 2a and b) overprinted by further intense silicification, fracturing and pyritization. Fragments within the breccia include, what appear to be, well banded cherty sedimentary rocks (Figure 2a) that may represent the remnants of a crater lake that formed at the top of the diatreme from hydrothermal fluids erupting at surface.\n\u2022 The diatreme breccias in the quarries cover an area approximately 400 x 500 metres. Prospecting has located another occurrence 600 metres to the north, approximately 300 x 500 m, and a smaller occurrence on the north side of the Conquest Zone.\n\u2022 Grab samples have been submitted for analyses with results pending. \"We are very excited to see evidence of a new hydrothermal system hosted within the diatreme breccias in the quarries; we always knew these breccias represented excellent targets, but we were not expecting to see such a rapid transition. We had planned to start advancing our understanding of the diatreme breccias this year, particularly related to the copper potential of Root & Cellar, and this certainly provides a catalyst. However, some of what we see is more suggestive of the epithermal gold system. We have boots on the ground now to see if this is related to Conquest or to a different system, and to better define the extent of the diatreme breccias. Either way, a large diatreme or maar-diatreme complex is a very exciting development at Root & Cellar.\n\nDiatremes are large, funnel-shaped breccia pipes formed by explosive volcanic eruptions, often due to magma interacting with groundwater. They are important in the formation of both gold and copper deposits with diatreme formation often preceding the main phase of epithermal mineralization by creating the initial fracture network that later mineralizing fluids exploit. Some of the world's largest copper-gold deposits are associated with maar-diatreme complexes, where brecciation and alteration were a crucial part of the overall magmatic-hydrothermal evolution of these systems. It is in these quarries that Prospector, Jeff Brushett, originally discovered the copper mineralization at Root & Cellar. Technical information in this news release was reviewed and approved by Christine Vaillancourt, P.Geo., the Company's Chief Geologist and a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101. Northern Shield Resources Inc. is a Canadian-based company known as a leader in generating high-quality exploration targets that views greenfield exploration as an opportunity to find a Tier 1 asset, near surface, and at relatively low cost. We implement a model driven exploration approach to reduce the risk associated with early-stage projects for ourselves, our shareholders, and the environment. This approach led us to option the Root & Cellar Property from a Newfoundland prospector, who discovered the mineralization, and then its advancement to a large gold-silver-tellurium system.
