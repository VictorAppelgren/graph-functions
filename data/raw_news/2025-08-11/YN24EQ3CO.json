  "description": "Lab tests show increased virus presence in both rural and urban areas, with warmer temperatures and dry weather contributing to the spread.",
  "content": "SAGINAW, MI \u2014 Saginaw County officials said lab tests revealed an uptick in West Nile virus-carrying mosquitos and birds during the final week of July.\n\nSaginaw County Mosquito Abatement Commission Director William Stanuszek said the county reported 13 cases of the mosquito-borne virus in July. Six of those 13 cases were detected in the last week of the month.\n\n\u201cJuly detections were spread across both rural and urban areas,\u201d Stanuszek said in a statement. \u201cWhile (West Nile virus) is often associated with urban environments due to the abundance of Culex mosquito habitat, the primary vector for this virus, its primary hosts are birds, which amplify the disease in nature and are found throughout the county.\u201d\n\nHe said warmer-than average temperatures and periods of dry weather contributed to the increase in West Nile virus activity.\n\nStanuszek said the increase in West Nile virus activity across Saginaw County was consistent with detections in neighboring Midland County as well as much of the Midwest, including Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois.\n\nSaginaw County records show West Nile virus was discovered this year in bird or mosquito samples collected in Blumfield, Brant, Bridgeport, Frankenmuth, Lakefield, Maple Grove, Saginaw, St. Charles and Swan Creek townships as well as the City of Saginaw.\n\nNo human infections have been reported in Saginaw County.\n\n\u201cAlthough the risk of mosquito-borne virus infection remains low, precautions should still be taken to reduce mosquito exposure,\u201d Stanuszek said.\n\nWest Nile virus is found annually in birds and mosquitoes. The first evidence of the virus discovered this year in Saginaw County was in late May.\n\nWest Nile virus can develop into a serious disease for humans, with people aged 60 and older the most likely to suffer from the most severe form of the illness.\n\nIn 2024, 31 Michigan residents tested positive for West Nile virus, according to the latest Michigan Arbovirus Surveillance Report. That figure compares to 24 Michigan residents in 2023.\n\nFor more information about the West Nile virus, visit the state\u2019s Michigan Emerging Disease Issues website at michigan.gov/emergingdiseases/home/west-nile.",

      "text": "SAGINAW, MI \u2014 A former mayor and attorney for the municipality said Saginaw\u2019s city charter provides a provision to automatically remove from office Saginaw City Councilwoman Monique Lamar-Silvia, who a jury found guilty of felonies related to election fraud.\nBut Saginaw City Hall officials said expelling a council member isn\u2019t so automatic.\nA legal document that outlines the structure, powers and functions of Saginaw\u2019s government, the 39-page city charter includes provisions that define how any of the nine Saginaw City Council seats could become vacant. One of those mechanisms includes when a council member \u201cis convicted of a felony.\u201d\nThat language seems to describe the circumstances of Lamar-Silvia. A jury on June 27 convicted Lamar-Silvia on four counts \u2014 including three felony counts \u2014 tied to the case. Election officials last summer alleged she falsified signatures on the Saginaw City Council candidate nominating petition of Eric Eggleston for the November 2024 election.\nWhile a sentencing hearing next month could land Lamar-Silvia in prison for up to five years, the 64-year-old remains free and operating as an elected official. She attended a council meeting 17 days after the verdict, voting on city budget and policy matters.\nDuring the council\u2019s public meetings since the investigation against Lamar-Silvia began last summer, the Saginaw City Hall administration and council have not addressed Lamar-Silvia\u2019s legal peril or its impact on her elected post, including after a jury found her guilty.\nSo, could she finish out her term, which expires in 2028?\nNo, said Floyd Kloc, who was both a former attorney for Saginaw City Hall as well as Saginaw\u2019s mayor until he opted not to seek re-election four years ago.\nKloc said the Saginaw charter provision referencing council members with felonies should automatically bring an end to Lamar-Silvia\u2019s elected status once Saginaw County Circuit Judge Andre R. Borrello sentences her in four weeks.\n\u201cThe charter doesn\u2019t mince words,\u201d said Kloc, an assistant attorney for Saginaw City Hall from 1979-88 and a member of the Saginaw City Council from 2011-20.\nKloc said, despite common perception, a conviction is not official until a judge rules on a sentencing, as opposed to when a jury hands down a guilty verdict. He said that distinction, per the charter, allows for Lamar-Silvia to remain a council member during the period between the guilty verdict and her sentencing.\nOnce she is sentenced, the language outlined in Section 92 of the charter \u201cby operation of law\u201d would expel Lamar-Silvia, Kloc said. The action should require no vote from the council, the former mayor said.\nSaginaw City attorney Amy Lusk was not willing to agree with Kloc\u2019s opinion, at least not entirely.\nHer response in part was muted by what Lusk described as \u201ca legal opinion protected by attorney-client privilege\u201d between her and the council.\n\u201cCity Administration is aware of Section 92 of the Charter, but its application likely requires additional action by Council,\u201d Lusk wrote in a statement to The Saginaw News/MLive.\nLusk would not clarify what \u201cadditional action\u201d would be required from the council.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I am unable to elaborate further at this time, because it would get into the detail of my prior opinion to City Council,\u201d Lusk wrote.\nShe did not share details of that \u201cprior opinion\u201d either.\nPresented with Lusk\u2019s response, Kloc said he did not understand what \u201cadditional action\u201d she was referencing.\nHe said no vote was necessary from the council to abide by the city charter\u2019s provisions; the provisions govern the council on behalf of constituents.\n\u201cThe charter is the clear and unambiguous voice of city citizens,\u201d said Kloc, who served as Saginaw\u2019s mayor from 2018-20.\nThe Saginaw News/MLive reached out to all nine members of the council earlier this week, seeking their input on the charter provision and its potential impact on Lamar-Silvia\u2019s elected position.\nNone of them responded.\nThe council next gathers for its bi-weekly public meetings at 6:30 p.m. Monday, July 28, at Andersen Enrichment Center, 120 Ezra Rust in Saginaw.\nIt\u2019s unclear if Lamar-Silvia plans to attend her second gathering since the guilty verdict. She and her attorney, Matthew M. Evans, did not respond to messages from The Saginaw News/MLive this week.\nDuring the July 14 council meeting, Lamar-Silvia said she would in the \u201cvery near future\u201d make a statement \u201cof what I will and will not be doing.\u201d\nAs of this publication, she has not provided any public statements regarding her legal peril.\nLamar-Silvia\u2019s sentencing hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 27.\nThere are other avenues that could lead to Lamar-Silvia\u2019s removal from political office, although some measures remain distant.\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer possesses the power to remove elected officials based on a recommendation from the state Attorney General office. Officials with the governor\u2019s and state Attorney General\u2019s offices have not stated such a process has begun in the case of Lamar-Silvia.\nVoters can remove Lamar-Silvia from office, but not until November 2025. Under Michigan law, recall elections cannot be initiated against officials until 12 months after they win an election.\nLamar-Silvia won her second four-year term in November 2024, one month after state officials announced their investigation against her.\nA jury spent less than two hours deliberating before providing a guilty verdict during Lamar-Silvia\u2019s three-day trial last month.\nThe trial included witness testimony from Saginaw City Hall officials and evidence collected at the city\u2019s governmental center, where Lamar-Silvia on July 23, 2024, helped Eggleston collect signatures for his nominating petition to join the race for the Saginaw City Council. Eggleston, who was a co-defendant in the trial with Lamar-Silvia and also was found guilty of felonies related to the case, ultimately was excluded from November 2024 ballots.\nThe evidence presented during the trial included security camera footage from Saginaw City Hall, where witnesses said Eggleston and Lamar-Silvia scrambled to seek signatures for his nominating petition less than an hour before a filing deadline. Prosecutors and witnesses said the footage showed Lamar-Silvia applying multiple signatures to the petition form.\nSecretary of State and Saginaw City Hall officials testified the three signatures in question did not match with state records tied to the names connected to those three signatures: Saginaw Councilwoman Heidi Wiggins as well as Lamar-Silvia\u2019s daughter and son-in-law.\nEggleston\u2019s attorney said Lamar-Silvia was motivated to help Eggleston join the council because she hoped he would aid in her bid to become Saginaw\u2019s next mayor.\nDespite state officials announcing the investigation into Lamar-Silvia weeks before the November 2024 election, she received 5,440 votes from Saginaw residents.\nVoters first elected her to serve on the council in November 2020."

      "text": "SAGINAW, MI \u2014 Officials with a big-box home improvement retail chain announced plans to expand operations at a manufacturing site in northeast Saginaw.\nMenards Inc. already operates a distribution center at 1808 Veterans Memorial Parkway in the city.\nNick Brenner, a real estate representative for the national chain, said a proposed $20 million investment at the 30-acre distribution center would add a bagging facility to service Menards Inc. retail stores across Michigan and Ohio.\n\u201c(A bagging facility) is where we bag different aggregate products such as Portland cement and pea gravel,\u201d Brenner told the Saginaw City Council at the governing body\u2019s Monday, July 14, meeting. \u201cWe have these plants scattered throughout the Midwest, but we do not have one here in Michigan.\u201d\nThe council later voted unanimously in favor of establishing an industrial development district at the property, which Brenner said would help Menards recoup some of the costs tied to the proposed development.\nSome of those costs would include environmental cleanup efforts, Brenner said. Since opening the distribution facility in Saginaw in 2011, Menards Inc. officials have engaged in cleanup efforts at the site that once housed the General Motors Nodular Iron plant, which closed in 1987.\nThe Menards Inc. bagging facility proposal would involve building a 39,000-square-foot facility at the company\u2019s Veterans Memorial Parkway campus, officials said.\nBrenner said the proposed expansion would add up to nine jobs at the company\u2019s northeast Saginaw campus, where about 75 employees already work.\nThe distribution center is located about 8 miles east of the retail store Menards Inc. operates in neighboring Saginaw Township.\nThe Saginaw City Council voted 8-0 in favor of establishing the industrial development district.\nThat vote included Councilwoman Monique Lamar-Silvia, who voted on Saginaw resolutions and policies for the first time since a jury convicted her on four counts \u2014 including two felony counts \u2014 tied to falsified signatures that election officials said she applied to the Saginaw City Council candidate nominating petition of Eric Eggleston.\nCouncilman Bill Ostash was absent from the gathering Monday."
