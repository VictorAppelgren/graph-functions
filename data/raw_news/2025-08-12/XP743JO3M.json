  "description": "Tecogen Reports Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results  Morningstar",
  "content": "NORTH BILLERICA, MA / ACCESS Newswire / August 12, 2025 / Tecogen Inc. (NYSE American:TGEN), a leading manufacturer of clean energy products, reported revenues of $7.29 million and net loss of $1.47 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 compared to revenues of $4.73 million, and a net loss of $1.54 million in 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.64 million at June 30, 2025.\n\nAbinand Rangesh, CEO of Tecogen, commented that \"since our last earnings call we have made tremendous progress with our data center strategy and achieved several key milestones. We received our first LOI for a great pilot project. This is for a 100+MW data center with the potential to be a 500+MW site. The customer expects to evaluate 6 STx chillers during the first phase of the project. If successful, more chillers will be used in subsequent phases. We expect the LOI to convert to a PO later this year and we hope to grow with this customer.\n\nIn the last three months, our marketing has generated great leads. We have now quoted two projects for 60 to 100 chillers each. We have multiple other projects that are earlier stage but have similar potential. We've also received feedback on how customers are making purchasing decisions. During the call, I will address what these are and the steps we are taking so we can convert these leads into orders.\n\nThe only setback this quarter was the reduction in the gross profit margin which drove the net loss. Product margin was lower because we started shipping the hybrid air-cooled chiller. As expected, the first few units had higher costs due to low volume material purchasing and as our team gained experience building the product. We expect the hybrid chiller margin to increase with volume production. The other products shipped this quarter had similar margins as previous quarters.\n\nOverall service margin declined because of one region - Manhattan and NJ. This was in part due to bulk oil system upgrades for our InVerde fleet. This has a short term impact on profitability but increases service intervals by 150% to 200%. We also experienced increased overtime hours. During the call, we will discuss the new protocols we have implemented to restore this territory to profitability.\n\nGiven the size of potential projects, the ability to manufacture and ship significant volumes of chillers is critical. We have hired talent in manufacturing and engineering. The additional staffing was a significant factor in our increased operating expenses, which increased by 9% in Q2 2025 compared to last year. To provide the necessary capital to scale our business, we also raised $18.2 million in July. The capital raised will be used to increase factory output and for marketing. I will share more details on the data center projects, Vertiv and scale up plan tomorrow.\"\n\u2022 None Net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was $1.46 million compared to a net loss of $1.54 million for the same period of 2024, a decrease of $0.07 million, due to increased gross profit from our Products and Services segments. EPS for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 was a loss of $(0.06)/share, respectively.\n\u2022 None Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was $2.12 million compared to a net loss of $2.64 million for the same period of 2024, a decrease of $0.52 million, due to increased gross profit from our Products and Services segments.

The increase in revenue during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 is due to increased chiller and cogeneration revenue, which included the initial deliveries of our hybrid-drive air-cooled chiller.\n\u2022 None Services revenues in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 were $3.97 million, compared to $4.13 million for the same period in 2024, a decrease of 3.9% due to decreased revenues from the acquired Aegis maintenance contracts.\n\u2022 None Energy Production revenues in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 were $0.17 million compared to $0.48 million for the same period in 2024, a decrease of 63.8%. The decrease in Energy Production revenue is due to contract expirations at certain energy production sites in late 2024 and the temporary shutdown of a few energy production sites for repairs.\n\u2022 None Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025 were $14.57 million compared to $10.91 million for the same period in 2024, a 33.5% increase.\n\u2022 None Products revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2025 were $5.69 million compared to $1.61 million for the same period in 2024, an increase of 253.1%.

The decrease in gross margin was due to higher material and labor costs in our Products and Services segments in the the six months ended June 30, 2025.\n\u2022 None Operating expenses increased $0.32 million, or 9.0%, to $3.87 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2025 compared to $3.55 million in the same period in 2024, due to increased payroll, benefits, recruitment costs, and sales commissions.\n\u2022 None Operating expenses increased $0.51 million, or 7.1%, to $7.69 million in six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to $7.18 million in the same period in 2024, due to increased payroll, benefits, recruitment costs and sales commissions.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was negative $1.16 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 compared to negative $1.30 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required under the securities laws.\n\nIn addition to those factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in our Current reports on Form 8-K, under \"Risk Factors,\" and elsewhere therein, among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past and projected future results are the following: fluctuations in demand for our products and services, competing technological developments, issues relating to research and development, the availability of incentives, rebates, and tax benefits relating to our products and services, changes in the regulatory environment relating to our products and services, integration of acquired business operations, the impact of tariffs, and the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms to fund existing operations and anticipated growth.\n\nIn addition to GAAP financial measures, this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA which excludes certain expenses as described in the presentation. We use Adjusted EBITDA as an internal measure of business operating performance and believe that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of our current business and enables investors to better understand and evaluate our historical and prospective operating performance by eliminating items that vary from period to period without correlation to our core operating performance and highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures.\n\nIn addition to reporting net income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle (\"GAAP\") measure, this news release contains information about Adjusted EBITDA (net income (loss) attributable to Tecogen Inc adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, unrealized gain or loss on investment securities, goodwill impairment charges and other non-cash non-recurring charges including abandonment of certain intangible assets), which is a non-GAAP measure. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to view its performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management and provides additional insight into its operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated through the application of GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of net income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.\n\nIn addition to reporting net income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle (\"GAAP\") measure, this news release contains information about Adjusted EBITDA (net income (loss) attributable to Tecogen Inc adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, unrealized gain or loss on investment securities, goodwill impairment charges and other non-cash non-recurring charges including abandonment of certain intangible assets), which is a non-GAAP measure.
