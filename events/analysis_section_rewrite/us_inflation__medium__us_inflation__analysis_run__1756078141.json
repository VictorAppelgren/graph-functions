      "feedback": "The draft has breadth but not the tight, testable 3–6 month scenario map that SECTION FOCUS requires: the causal chain from policy to rates to consumer and risk assets isn’t clearly articulated, timing windows aren’t specified, and the base/alts/invalidations are underdeveloped and underquantified. Actionable edits: rebuild a crisp, source-grounded causal spine (OBBBA/Big Beautiful Bill) → near‑term Treasury issuance and rate path → policy-driven changes to Medicaid/food-stamps and debt dynamics → downstream effects on consumer staples (private-label dynamics at Walmart and Aldi; Great Value/BetterGoods pricing power) and on risk assets; quantify each link with concrete numbers from the sources (e.g., the $3.4 trillion package with up to $4 trillion debt impact over a decade per EPJYXB7DX; private-label price discipline evidenced by the $2–$15 average BetterGoods price band; private-label suppliers like Sara Lee behind Great Value; tire-price and durability tradeoffs from V8TEZOR8R; Pacaso/Range/Mogul metrics such as Pacaso’s 21% US co-ownership growth, 1.8T vacation-market, 10 new international destinations, and Mogul’s 10–12% cash-on-cash yields or 18.8% blended return where cited) and tie them to specific timing windows (0–2 weeks: monitor Treasury auctions; 1–6 weeks: inflation prints; 1–3 months: Medicaid work‑requirements rollout and any budgetary revisions; 3–6 months: Pacaso expansion momentum, HeartSciences FDA/Medicare updates, and private‑market fund inflows). Add a formal base case plus 1–2 clear alts with probability weights and explicit invalidation criteria (e.g., if 10‑year yields or funding costs rise beyond a stated threshold; if AI-driven productivity signals underwhelm by more than a modest 0.5–1.0% annualized productivity gain; if HeartSciences FDA/CMS milestones slip beyond a defined calendar window; if Pacaso private-market demand falters or regulatory constraints bite). Strengthen the watch-list with concrete signals (Treasury issuance pace; CPI/PCE prints; private-label margin trajectories; private-market deal flow in Pacaso/mogul/HeartSciences; and the товарized “watch-lists” of 1–2 data releases) and assign explicit triggers to invalidate the bull or bear path. Improve citation discipline and consistency by anchoring every numeric claim to a source ID (no stray or misformatted tags; e.g., use (EPJYXB7DX), (UPV3X2MQ6), (YQOMV2HAJ), (V8TEZOR8R), (ILY C1M41F) or, ideally, the correct ID without spaces such as (ILYC1M41F) and (UPV3X2MQ6)); reconcile conflicts (e.g., debt impact vs. growth ballast) by revealing the range and the dominant channel in each scenario. After these fixes, end with a concise base-case articulation, 1–2 clearly defined alternatives, a risk/invalidations section, watch-list signals, and a quantified confidence level.",
