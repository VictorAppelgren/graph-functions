  "title": "Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2 Review: The Only Earbuds You Want on an Airplane",
  "description": "Once again, Bose's ANC is top-notch in the second-gen QuietComfort Ultra.",
  "content": "How much do you value quiet? I\u2019m not trying to get profound here\u2014this is a gadget review, not a self-help seminar\u2014but it\u2019s a question worth asking. Personally, I find quiet to be pretty important. Nothing says loving myself like putting on a pair of earbuds and telling the entirety of New York City to kindly, f**k off. And for that peace of mind, you have a lot of earbuds at your disposal. Any pair worth its weight in plastic will have the option for ANC nowadays. But just because they all have it doesn\u2019t mean every pair of ANC buds is created equal. To the contrary, my friends, there are levels to this shit.\n\nIf you\u2019re like Bose and you put \u201cquiet\u201d in the name of your earbuds, one should expect a high degree of noise cancellation\u2014even more so for a gen-2 product. And folks, I\u2019m here to tell you (not quietly) that\u2019s exactly what the $299 Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd gen) bring to the table.\n\nI tested these puppies in some of the worst conditions you can imagine (the chaotic NYC subway), and I can say, without a doubt, if I want to block the maximum amount of noise with earbuds, these will be the ones I reach for. Bose doesn\u2019t provide exact dB numbers on how much cancellation its newest QuietComfort Ultra earbuds block out, but anecdotally it feels like a lot.\n\nOn the subway, I felt extremely insulated from train noise and voices, which is incredible if you\u2019re trying to zone out on your commute to work or avoid any unwanted conversations. I also tested them at a busy coffee shop with lots of chatter and music playing, and they blocked out all of that racket adeptly when I started playing music.\n\nEven when I wasn\u2019t playing music, just sitting with the earbuds in my ears, it silenced most of the ambient noise. These might be the only earbuds I want on my next flight. Bose says it went back to the lab and adjusted its ActiveSense technology, which enables adaptive ANC in the QuietComfort Ultra 2 to make transitions in noise-cancellation levels \u201csmoother.\u201d\n\nWhile I haven\u2019t had a chance to use the QuietComfort Ultra gen-1, I can say that I didn\u2019t find the second-gen version to be choppy in their ANC adjustments when I had adaptive ANC activated.\n\nIf you actually do want to hear something, the QuietComfort Ultra 2 also have excellent transparency. By tapping and holding the side of the right earbud, you can switch from \u201cQuiet\u201d to \u201cAware\u201d mode, which turns off ANC and allows you to hear your surroundings.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t normally do this, for politeness\u2019 sake, but I tested Bose\u2019s second-gen QuietComfort Ultra buds\u2019 transparency mode by having some conversations with them in, including an exchange at a pharmacy. Even with my ears plugged up, I didn\u2019t miss a beat. I still hate having my ears blocked when I talk to people, since I can hear my voice reverberate in my own head (yuck), but if you need to have a conversation quickly and don\u2019t want to pop the buds out, you can at least hear other people easily.\n\nAnother highlight you might notice while switching between modes is that the touch controls on the outside of the buds are very sensitive. That might be annoying in some cases, like if you accidentally brush your bud while fixing your hair or taking off a hat, but I actually think this is a perk.\n\nI\u2019ve used a lot of underwhelming touch controls in my day, and these are not among them. Personally, I\u2019d rather have touch controls be oversensitive than under. I\u2019d prefer to have a few accidental miscues than have to aggressively tap on the buds to get them to do what I want. The good news is, if you disagree, you can now turn off the touch controls completely in the Bose app to avoid the miscues altogether.\n\nSound-wise, the QuietComfort Ultra hold their own. It was hard switching between the QuietComfort Ultra 2 and the Technics EAH-AZ100 that I happened to be testing at the same time, since the latter are some of the best-sounding earbuds I\u2019ve ever used, but I still think these earbuds will appease most sound-wise. I listened to the same record that I used for testing the aforementioned Technics buds (Geese\u2019s \u201c3D Country\u201d), and while they didn\u2019t have the same dynamic range or clarity as the Technics, they kept pace with other \u201cPro\u201d earbuds I\u2019ve used in the past, like Google\u2019s Pixel Buds Pro.\n\nMids and highs were represented satisfactorily. I would say they even manage to push the envelope in the bass department, which was a lot bassier, for lack of a better word, than I was expecting. If you don\u2019t like the out-of-the-box tuning, you can switch things up in the Bose app with custom and preset EQ.\n\nOne thing that may be divisive among the general public is the look of the buds. They\u2019re chunky, I\u2019m not going to lie, but I like the design, especially in the white color that I got the buds in, which reminds me of a muted PlayStation 1.\n\nDespite how big the buds are, I didn\u2019t find the weight to be annoying, and Bose did a good job with balancing the size with making them look sleek, mixing the matte-ish plastic of the case with a shiny, smooth plastic on the buds. There\u2019s a smooth metal strip along the stem with some Bose branding. Just like the SoundLink Plus, Bose\u2019s newest Bluetooth speaker that I also recently tested, I find the QuietComfort Ultra 2 to be an appealing blend of minimalism and creativity.\n\nFeature-wise, these buds are stacked. If you want 3D audio, you can switch the buds to \u201cImmersion\u201d mode which which tracks audio to your head movements, there\u2019s an ear tip fit test in the Bose app, custom EQ, and one cool feature in this generation is that you can now see the case\u2019s battery levels in your app, so you know when you need to charge it up. I say once again, you need to stop sleeping on your earbuds\u2019 companion app\u2014there\u2019s a lot there to love.\n\nSpeaking of battery, Bose says the QuietComfort Ultra 2 get up to 6 hours of battery with ANC on, but that figure drops (naturally) to 4 hours if you have Immersive audio activated. That case holds 24 hours of juice, so about three full charges. That\u2019s not the best battery life in the world, but it\u2019s average.\n\nThe fact is, Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Ultra 2 do one thing really well, and that\u2019s block out noise. In some cases, only having one great feature could be considered a flaw, especially for earbuds that cost $299, but ANC is one of the main reasons why people buy wireless earbuds in the first place, so Bose seems to have focused its energy in the right direction.\n\nWhile these earbuds aren\u2019t giving you the same level of hi-fi sounds as some other similarly priced earbuds on the market, they reward you in dividends when your neighbor is having a raucous party, once again.",

      "text": "There are a lot of wireless earbuds in the world today. In fact, at this exact moment, there are no less than (count \u2019em) three pairs in my coat pocket right now as I type these words. That\u2019s a lot of earbuds for one person to have, and that figure only becomes even more ridiculous when you consider all three pairs of said wireless earbuds are from one single company\u2014and they were all released at the same time.\nThat company in question is CMF, which is a sub-brand of the audio-turned-phone company, Nothing. Last month CMF released three different pairs of wireless earbuds\u2014the Buds 2a, the Buds 2, and the Buds 2 Plus. If you\u2019re saying to yourself, \u201cthat seems excessive,\u201d then I\u2019m in agreement with you, but hold your judgment until the end because things are about to get even more complicated.\nAll three of those wireless earbuds have different prices; all three of them have different levels of active noise cancellation (ANC); and all three of them have different drivers. That means, as you\u2019re about to learn, all three of them deliver a different listening experience, and that means you ought to know what you\u2019re getting into before you roll the dice and purchase a pair. But where do you start? Spec sheets are helpful, but they only bring you so far. It\u2019s the experience of using them\u2014the real discernible one that decibels on a chart might not portray\u2014that really matters. If only there were someone who spent time trying all three to tell you just which pair you need and which you can potentially forget\u2026\nCMF by Nothing Buds 2 Plus\nThe CMF Buds 2 Plus may be the most expensive of the pack, but they're still the most bang for the buck. Trust me, you'll hear the difference\u2014I sure did.\nPros\n- Robust bass\n- Good dynamic range\n- Affordable\nCons\n- No orange color\n- Similar sound to Buds 2 at times\nIn case you didn\u2019t get my not-so-subtle hint, I tried all three of CMF\u2019s new pairs of wireless earbuds to bring you the answer to your burning question: which pair of Buds 2 should you get? The answer may not surprise you, but before we get to my experience and comparison, let\u2019s start at the beginning. What\u2019s going on with these wireless earbuds?\nFirst, at the lowest end, there\u2019s the Buds 2a, which I got in this appealing orange color that the 2 Plus unfortunately does not come in. Naturally, these wireless earbuds have the lowest level of everything in the spec department, and they also have the lowest price. The Buds 2a have 42 decibels of noise cancellation, a 12.4 mm Bio-fiber driver, and 5 hours of battery life with ANC on and 8 hours with ANC off. They retail at a very reasonable price of $49.\nThen, there\u2019s the middle child: the Buds 2, which, if you\u2019ve been following along, have slightly elevated specs and a slightly higher price, though there\u2019s actually one big caveat on that front that I\u2019ll get to in a moment. The Buds 2 have 48 decibels of noise cancellation, 11mm PMI drivers enhanced by Dirac Opteo\u2019s tuning, and 7.5 hours of battery life with ANC on and 13.5 hours with ANC off. Here\u2019s where things get interesting; they usually retail at a $10 premium compared to the Buds 2a (that\u2019s $59), but as of this writing, they\u2019re $10 off, which makes them the same price of $49.\nFinally, there\u2019s the Buds 2 Plus, which are the proverbial cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of CMF by Nothing\u2019s most recent lineup (forgetting the Buds 2 Pro that came out last year for a moment) that have\u2014say it with me now\u2014the highest price tag. The Buds 2 Plus have 50 decibels of adaptive noise cancellation (only slightly higher than the Buds 2 but with a 5400Hz frequency range as opposed to the former\u2019s 5200Hz range), a 12 mm liquid crystal polymer driver, and 7.5 hours of ANC playback out of the case and 14 hours of non-ANC playback. They, as I alluded to, are the most expensive of the three pairs at $69.\nOkay, got all that? Stay with me, now! The lineup, with its similar names, looks, and slight variations in features and price, is confusing, and there\u2019s no way of getting around that. Don\u2019t worry, though, for everyone\u2019s sake (myself included), we\u2019re going to put all of that aside for a moment and get down to brass tacks: what do these things actually sound like? On that front, I\u2019ve got good news and bad news.\nI\u2019ve been using CMF\u2019s budget wireless buds for the past couple of weeks, and I honestly didn\u2019t know what to expect. Sometimes you really get what you pay for (see: this scrappy but frankly bad pair of pocket-sized earbuds I reviewed from Jlabs) and sometimes the cheapest option is actually the best (see: Nothing\u2019s Ear (a) wireless earbuds). Because of that variability, I came into the trio of CMF wireless buds with an open mind, but ultimately, I was surprised at what I found.\nAs a test, I listened to the same song (My Bloody Valentine\u2019s \u201cOnly Shallow\u201d) with each pair, back-to-back-to-back, and under the same conditions\u2014a fairly quiet area of the Gizmodo office. Starting first with the highest-end pair, the Buds 2 Plus, I worked my way down until I hit the Buds 2a.\nSo let\u2019s start from the top: the CMF Buds 2 Plus sound great. There\u2019s dynamic range, and the noise cancellation, though not world-class, is solid enough for your subway commute (an environment that I also tested all three buds in). Frankly, I think they\u2019re almost as nice as Nothing\u2019s Ear (a), which is probably my favorite pair of Nothing wireless earbuds for the value and design. All in all, I\u2019m a fan of the CMF Buds 2 Plus. I wouldn\u2019t choose them as my \u201cdaily driver,\u201d so to speak, just because I love the ceramic driver on Nothing\u2019s Ear wireless earbuds more and their transparent design, but if I were forced to use them, I wouldn\u2019t be mad about the quality.\nNext, I tried the CMF Buds 2, the middle child, which, while pleasant, didn\u2019t quite sing like the Buds 2 Plus. They do an equally good job of simulating bass, but they definitely are a little muddier compared to their premium-priced counterparts. ANC, as I suspected, based on the level of noise cancellation stated in CMF\u2019s spec sheets, was about the same as the 2 Plus, which is nice, but if you\u2019re looking for the highest fidelity, the 2 Plus wins this round.\nThen there\u2019s the baby\u2014the CMF Buds 2a. This is where I noticed the biggest dropoff. While the price is very approachable, these buds sound by far the tinniest out of the lineup and bring the lowest level of noise cancellation. It was harder to notice when I was testing the wireless buds anecdotally and randomly on my morning commute, but I\u2019m not a big fan of the dynamic range or the noise cancellation on the Buds 2a. I\u2019d say you get what you pay for, but these buds now cost the same as the Buds 2, and the midrange pair are leaps and bounds better.\nSo, those are unscientific conclusions. In this case, the Buds 2 Plus justify the premium price, and while the Buds 2 are serviceable, they definitely don\u2019t deliver the same quality. You can forget all about the Buds 2a because they don\u2019t deliver anywhere near the sound quality of the Buds 2, which are now the same damn price. But just to be sure I wasn\u2019t letting the knowledge of price affect my judgment, I did a blind test to see if I could really hear the difference, and mostly my impressions remained the same.\nIn a blindfolded listening test, I was able to identify the three different wireless buds correctly six times in a row on two different styles of songs (rock and hip-hop), though there are some frequencies where the difference is harder to notice, like more \u201ccinematic\u201d music with fewer frequencies to keep track of. The Buds 2a are a dead giveaway with their tinny, almost hollow sound, and the Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus are definitely harder to differentiate but still have enough tells in most genres\u2014the Buds 2 Plus typically have better bass and a fuller sound profile.\nWhile I don\u2019t love to be upsold on anything, sometimes in this world, you get what you pay for, and the CMF wireless earbuds are no different. My advice is, if you can afford the $20 premium over the Buds 2 and Buds 2a, then you should pay it\u2014get the Buds 2 Plus. There\u2019s not much difference from an ANC perspective, but from sheer sound quality, the Buds 2 Plus earn their premium-sounding name, and they\u2019re still (if we\u2019re in the spirit of comparing) $50 cheaper than the Nothing Ear and $10 cheaper than the Ear (a)."

      "text": "The only thing I love more than foisting my music on other people at the park is doing it with a speaker that delivers solid or above-average sound quality. While I haven\u2019t had a chance to use Bose\u2019s new portable Bluetooth speaker, it seems like it could be a great option for doing just that.\nBose\u2019s SoundLink Plus is a midrange Bluetooth speaker that is very clearly designed for outdoor excursions since it can float and has an IP67 rating that makes it damn near waterproof and dustproof. Per Bose, the portable speaker is \u201cready for anything\u201d and is small enough to fit comfortably in a backpack or a duffel bag. I\u2019d agree with that assessment\u2014the speaker is nine inches wide and weighs a manageable 3.29 pounds. Despite that compact size, it still has a subwoofer, a tweeter, four passive radiators, and an estimated 20 hours of battery life, though that depends on how loud your beach neighbors\u2019 competing music is and whether you need to crank the volume or not.\nIt also has a nylon strap attached, which isn\u2019t exactly the most high-tech feature for a wireless speaker, but is pretty nice if you\u2019re carrying this thing around or want to attach it to your backpack or something. There\u2019s a new color, too, which Bose calls Citrus Yellow and gives what would otherwise be a pretty boring-looking speaker a nice pop. It falls pretty solidly in the midrange price category at $269, which sits between Bose\u2019s SoundLink Flex and the Max. Preorders launch June 12, with general availability coming June 26.\nWhile the SoundLink Plus is the newest thing Bose is introducing today, there are also second-gen updates to a couple of other audio products: the QuietComfort Ultra wireless earbuds and the SoundLink Micro Bluetooth speaker. Highlights for the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds include new and improved algorithms for adaptive noise cancellation and call quality, better battery life, and also a case that charges wirelessly. The SoundLink Micro gets some major quality-of-life upgrades with the addition of USB-C charging, a major battery life bump from 6 hours to 12 hours, and, according to Bose, \u201cimproved sound performance.\u201d Both are expected to be released later this summer at $299 and $129, respectively.\nAs for the new SoundLink Plus speaker, we\u2019ll have our hands on one soon enough, so make sure you report back for my full review about whether Bose\u2019s newest Bluetooth speaker is worth the price. Apologies in advance to all my park neighbors; I\u2019m annoying you for science."

      "text": "JLab\u2019s popularity stems from producing ultra-affordable audio peripherals, like $20 wireless earbuds and $40 keychain earbuds. Most conversations around this brand have mostly been about how they manage to make decent audio gear for the price of takeout. You might\u2019ve seen JLab Go Pop ANC True Wireless Earbuds at your local Best Buy or Target, advertised as \u201cthe cheapest ANC buds on the market\u201d for just $30. When I mentioned this to my coworker, his first reaction was, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t imagine anything sounding that good for $30.\u201d So, I decided to call them in and test that for myself.\nAfter spending a few days with these, I wouldn\u2019t say my coworker was entirely right, but I won\u2019t be fully siding with JLab either. Technically, they\u2019re great at what they\u2019re touting the most: great ANC. But they underperform in a bunch of other areas. Given the unbelievably low price, I\u2019m fairly forgiving about the build quality, but I do wish the sound had more depth, detail, and soul.\nPros\n- ANC is as powerful as promised\n- Compact form factor makes them easy to wear for extended periods\n- Long-lasting battery life\n- Decent dust and water resistance\nCons\n- Features a flimsy build\n- Volume controls could've been better\n- Poor app interface\n- Tinny, sharp sound\nJLab Go Pop ANC Earbuds Review: Design and Fit\nI know you know better than to expect expensive material or extra bells and whistles from a $30 pair of buds. I kept my expectations as low as possible, too. And on that front, at least, I wasn\u2019t very disappointed. Maybe the bar was too low, to begin with, but I was happy that the case is sufficiently durable, if not very robust, has no moving or loose parts, and the material is not the lowest quality I have come across.\nSee JLab Go Pop ANC Earbuds at Target\nThe lid magnets are tight and snappy, giving the case a satisfying click when closed. While the plastic doesn\u2019t look as premium as aluminum or glass, and its light weight hints at its budget quality, it doesn\u2019t feel flimsy. One extra feature is an in-built Type-C cord tucked into the underside\u2014a small but thoughtful addition that saves you from needing a cable on hand.\nThe earbuds mirror the case\u2019s minimalist aesthetic, with an all-plastic body, no hint of flashiness, and just enough sturdiness to avoid feeling flimsy. Aside from the company logo on the exterior, there\u2019s little else in terms of design. The Go Pop ANC earbuds make it very clear that they\u2019re $30 buds.\nMy biggest point of concern with in-ear buds is the fit. The Go Pop ANC were ideal in this regard. After unboxing, I immediately switched from the default medium to the small ear tips, which fit me well. I didn\u2019t have to adjust the buds; they stayed securely in place throughout use. While they weigh 8.2g and aren\u2019t the lightest buds on the market, their compact form factor kept them from feeling bulky\u2014unlike the new Bose QuietComfort buds that felt like which felt like oversized buttons in my ears. I used these as my go-to earbuds for calls, music, and podcasts over several days and never felt discomfort.\nJLab Go Pop ANC Earbuds Review: Controls\nIt was an irritating experience to navigate on the buds\u2019 poorly designed companion app to assign gestures to controls. Functionality-wise, the app is fine, but the flimsy UI makes it bothersome. You only get single, double, triple, and long tap gestures. I assigned volume to a single tap, with the right bud controlling the volume up and the left bud turning it down. While it worked decently well, it was inconvenient not to have the volume on a sliding scale, which would have been better for a swiping action. Tapping for volume control meant I couldn\u2019t tap twice in a row (to turn the volume two levels up) because that would\u2019ve been incorrectly read as a double tap, which was assigned to pausing/playing the music. And long-tapping for volume control meant I had little control over the increments.\nI like that the earbud controls also include cycling between three EQ presets. Though I don\u2019t see myself using that often enough to bother with it, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019ll be useful to a lot of users.\nJLab Go Pop ANC Earbuds Review: Sound and ANC\nHearing the painfully average sound on the JLab Go Pop ANC Earbuds made me realize they might only be good for the one feature they seem most focused on: ANC. I can only imagine the sound suiting a child whose ears aren\u2019t tuned well enough to make out the intricacies in a song. I played around on the presets and tried custom-tuning one, but the earbuds still sounded too flat. They lack detail and layers, so it sounds as if all the elements of the orchestra are badly clustered together. A spacious and airy-sounding orchestra is the number one sign of a good pair of buds, which I didn\u2019t get to enjoy on these.\nThe JLab Go Pop ANC buds are definitely more treble-focused than bass. But they\u2019re far from subtle at that. Instead of a slight inclination towards the high-end, which you\u2019d expect on a treble-focused audio peripheral, these sound overly tinny, sharp, and harsh, especially at louder volumes. The 10mm driver size is one obvious factor that points towards the buds being less focused on bass. Wireless earbuds this size usually sport around 12mm drivers. A bigger driver size helps with increased bass, though that\u2019s not the only factor determining it.\nThe noise canceling, on the other hand, is very impressive. It\u2019s extremely powerful and successfully canceled my noisy work commute from NYC\u2019s Midtown to Downtown. It dealt with traffic very well, completely muting the loud, constant rumble of car engines. That\u2019s as bass-heavy a sound can get, and for these $30 buds to cancel that well was commendable. Owing to a longer sound wave, low-end sounds are the most difficult to cancel, so I was very happy with the noise canceling.\nDuring my testing period, as I commuted to my office with the Go Pop ANC buds, I tested the ANC mode against many passerbys\u2019 conversations\u2014a sound that many ANC modes struggle with\u2014but these passed that test with flying colors. With ANC off and my music playing, I could hear their voices but couldn\u2019t make out the conversation. But with ANC on, it was as if I was the only person on the sidewalk.\nI like that the JLab Go Pop ANC didn\u2019t overdo the canceling or the ambient mode. When the former is overdone, it results in an uncomfortable eardrum suck that you can only tolerate for so long. After a while, your ear canals start demanding you for a break. When the ambient mode is overdone, there\u2019s usually a fake hiss in the background, and all the sounds in your surroundings are weirdly exaggerated. The ambient mode on the Go Pop ANC buds, which JLab calls Be Aware, sounds so natural that I could barely tell the difference between the mode and ANC and ambient mode off.\nJLab Go Pop ANC Earbuds Review: Battery Life and Resistance\nYou\u2019re looking at about seven hours of battery with ANC off and around just an hour less with noise canceling turned on. With the case included, the scores increase to 24 and 21 hours, respectively. Both of these figures are pretty standard for wireless earbuds. The seven hours are slightly higher, with most in-ear peripherals lasting around six hours without ANC and the underwhelming flagship Apple AirPods only lasting five or four hours. Despite the somewhat standard battery life scores, I\u2019ll give the Go Pop ANC buds an extra point in the department simply because they manage to offer the industry standard at a fraction of the price. Quick charging is supported (10 minutes giving you an hour of playback), but wireless charging isn\u2019t.\nJLab\u2019s latest buds sport an IP55 dust and water resistance, which makes me pretty confident about using them around a pool or at the gym during a sweaty workout.\nJLab Go Pop ANC Earbuds Review: Verdict\nI can\u2019t complain about the JLab Go Pop ANC Earbuds because they successfully deliver the feature they market the most: noise cancelation. You also get a compact and easy fit, a battery life that\u2019s pretty good at this asking price, and dust and water resistance that trumps what much more expensive buds offer. If they sounded less tinny, I could\u2019ve easily ignored the flimsy build and poorly designed app owing to their low price.\nI would still recommend these as entry-level buds for kids or someone simply looking for advanced earplugs to cancel out obnoxious street noise and don\u2019t care much about sound quality. At $30, it\u2019s unfair to expect these to perform as well as your regular midrange buds, so I\u2019m surprised at how much they get right."

      "text": "Two years after the release of the Google Pixel Buds Pro, Google announced its successor, the Pixel Buds Pro 2, at last month\u2019s Made by Google event. We liked the first-gen buds for their cute egg-shaped case (that Google insists on calling a \u2018pebble\u2019), great sound, and effective ANC. Our only gripe with those was the removal of wings from the package. Google probably heard our complaints and worked on the Pixel Buds Pro 2\u2019s fit, claiming they\u2019re now extremely snug in your ears.\nIt seems that the revised fit is what the Mountain View company is most proud of on these buds. That, along with the Tensor A1 chip, \u2018twice as powerful\u2019 ANC, \u2018premium\u2019 sound, and \u2018hands-free\u2019 Gemini integration. It bumped its flagship buds\u2019 price by $30\u2014they\u2019re $230 instead of the $200 first-gens. But considering there have been two whole years between the two releases, I\u2019d attribute (and justify) the price bump to annual inflation and rising material and labor costs.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2\nAn extremely comfortable fit, intuitive controls, and excellent ANC.\nPros\n- Massively reduced in size and weight\n- Very snug fit\n- Highly intuitive onboard controls\n- Excellent bass\n- Powerful noise canceling\n- Decent battery life\nCons\n- Pricey\n- Gemini integration is underwhelming\nSince my ears hate in-ear buds, I was most excited to test its reworked fit. I also recently checked out ChatGPT integration on the $60 CMF Buds Pro 2 and was curious to see if a $230 pair of buds would do AI integration better. The new Pixel buds launched in four beautiful shades: Porcelain, Hazel, Wintergreen, and Peony. I instantly fell for the Wintergreen and Peony.\nPixel Buds Pro 2 Review: Design and Fit\nWhatever the hell Google did on its \u201ctwist-to-adjust stabilizer,\u201d it worked. The fit is perfect. It finally cooked up the perfect recipe for in-ear buds that don\u2019t budge. These fit me so snugly that I wish Google could share its secret ingredients with other earbud manufacturers. After wearing them for extended periods, the buds didn\u2019t start hurting my ears and didn\u2019t plop out when I\u2019d briskly walk to catch the train. I wore them around the house while doing a million chores and outside on my way to the office. They stayed put throughout.\nOne ingredient could be these little wings-type things that the buds grew back this generation. They\u2019re significantly smaller than typical earbud wings, but their function is the same: they complement the fit and make the buds tighter in your ears. They\u2019re fully rubberized and feel comfortable against your concha.\nHowever, the twist-to-adjust stabilizer is supposed to offer two separate kinds of fits. You can twist the buds in one direction to \u201clock [them] securely in your ear during workouts, or adjust the other way for all-day comfort.\u201d Upon extensively twisting them in my ears, I didn\u2019t feel the presence of two dedicated fit modes. The buds were either tight or not tight enough.\nI\u2019m also thankful for an XS ear tip in the package. Many companies overlook extra small or large sizes, so I\u2019m happy that Google accommodates tiny-eared folks. Having just reviewed the extremely loose and ill-fitted Apple AirPods 4, these little, button-like peripherals that tightly hug your ear canals felt like fresh air.\nI cannot stress enough how tiny these earbuds truly are. They\u2019ve undergone a massive reduction in weight\u2014from 6.3 grams on the first-gen to 4.7 grams\u2014so their lightweightness also adds to their comfort. Google claims the small, comfortable, and lightweight design resulted from testing 45 million data points from different ears.\nPixel Buds Pro 2 Review: Controls\nVolume controls are often done extremely poorly on wireless earbuds. Take the flagship AirPods 4 as an example that doesn\u2019t feature onboard volume controls. The CMF Buds Pro 2 allows double tap and hold as the only way to tweak volume\u2026 which is a lot of work. On the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, swiping up and down the stem is the only way to change volume, which wasn\u2019t terrible but slightly challenging as, while swiping down, I had to ensure I didn\u2019t pull the bud out of my ear.\nThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 tweak volume when you swipe on them horizontally. Swiping from back to front turns the volume up, and bringing your finger from front to back turns it down. These gestures are incredibly intuitive and made me wonder why other mainstream brands didn\u2019t think of such basic actions for volume control. Swiping up and down makes more sense on over-ear headphones that don\u2019t risk falling out of your ears. On tiny peripherals like these, horizontal swiping is significantly safer. I\u2019ve gotten used to turning to my phone for volume control while using in-ear buds, but the Pixel Buds Pro 2 made me use the onboard volume controls.\nThe rest of the functions are pretty straightforward, too. Single tapping controls playback, double tapping skips the song, and triple tapping takes you to the previous track. Long tapping on each bud can be customized to ANC or trigger Gemini. I assigned one action to each bud, and it only took me half a day to remember which bud does what.\nPixel Buds Pro 2 Review: Sound and ANC\nThe Tensor A1 chip did wonders on the Pixel Buds Pro 2. The sound is extremely crisp and detailed, allowing you to pay close attention to every little detail in the song. The low end is unarguably the most defined element of the sound profile on these buds, as it was on the first-gen Pixel Buds Pros. Owing to the 11mm drivers, the bass sits on a separate layer from the rest of the orchestra and requires most of your attention. On the predecessors, though, there were complaints about the low-end sounding excessively dominant. Thankfully, on these buds, it\u2019s not overdone to the point of sounding thick or muddy. It hits just the perfect spot.\nGoogle added a new high-frequency chamber to improve the treble. The high-end is less prominent than the low-end on these buds, but it sounds decent, far from being too sharp or tinny. The mids carry sufficient space and sound quite airy. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to music on the Pixel Buds Pro 2. I spent a good chunk of the review period listening to podcasts and taking calls on these, too, and had no complaints in those areas.\nThe Tensor AI\u2019s noise-canceling capabilities are what I\u2019m most impressed with. As expected, the buds did an excellent job at canceling low-end noise and were a little less effective at high-end noise (since that\u2019s harder to cancel.) Of course, sirens passed through, but people\u2019s conversations on the street were silenced to the point of being inaudible, which the AirPods 4 failed. I started losing my caller\u2019s voice when I passed over a Subway vent with a train passing underneath. Upon enabling ANC, the buds instantly transported me to a world where the train\u2019s sound was merely a distant hum.\nI\u2019m always pushed to disable ANC on the streets whenever I\u2019m dealing with earbuds that do it well, and that was my experience with the Pixel Buds Pro 2. The ANC is so powerful that you might have to put up with some eardrum suck. I felt that after extended periods of wearing these buds, I would just switch to ambient mode for a while to fix it.\nPixel Buds Pro 2 Review: Gemini AI\nPerhaps the biggest feature being touted on the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is their Gemini AI capabilities. Disappointingly, it doesn\u2019t really live up to the hype. You\u2019re required to manually trigger the buds every time you talk to them. The action is customizable between long-tapping either the right or left bud.\nIt works fine if you ask it one quick question during a busy commute when you don\u2019t have the time to pull out your phone and do a Google search. But for each follow-up question, you have to long-tap the bud every time. These buds marketed Gemini integration as a \u2018hands-free\u2019 feature that lets you get things done on the go. But it\u2019s not really hands-free when I\u2019m required to perform an action repeatedly.\nI also couldn\u2019t interrupt Gemini\u2019s voice, which was extremely annoying in situations where it had a long response for me. For instance, I asked about the weather in my area, and it started responding in Fahrenheit. Being a Celsius person, I immediately asked it to switch the unit. Still, I had to wait until it was done telling me about the current weather, highs, lows, rain forecast, etc., before I could ask it to do anything else.\nGemini on the Pixel Buds Pro 2 was also unreliable in some cases. I asked it about \u201ccoffee shops in my area that are open right now\u201d twice. First, it responded with a huge list, again not letting me interrupt it. The second time, which was hardly five minutes later and at the exact same spot (in my bed), it told me it couldn\u2019t provide real-time information about coffee shops in my area.\nI\u2019m glad it takes into consideration stuttering and pausing while you\u2019re talking. You can speak to it like you would a human. It also has good memory and understanding of context. Though pressing the bud for each follow-up question is exhausting, if you can put it up with that, the buds will do pretty well with follow-up questions. I started asking about the weather in my area and a couple of follow-up questions; I was saying things such as, \u201cWhat about next week in New Jersey?\u201d It knew we were still talking about the weather and responded accurately.\nPixel Buds Pro 2 Review: Battery Life\nThe Pixel Buds Pro 2\u2019s battery life is well-aligned with their claims. You get 12 or eight hours, with ANC off or on. With the charging case, those numbers go up to 48 and 30 hours. Compare this to the $180 AirPods 4, which offers a four to five-hour battery life and 20 to 30 hours with the case, depending on whether ANC is on or off, respectively. I\u2019ve been using the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for six days, alternating between music, podcasts, calls, and a lot of Instagram content, and I haven\u2019t had to charge the case yet.\nUsually, IP ratings apply to just the earbuds but not the case. On the Pixel Buds Pro 2, the charging case also comes with an IPX4 rating, which means it\u2019s not resistant to dust but offers pretty good water resistance. Having any sort of resistance on the case is great, so I\u2019ll happily take what I\u2019m getting. The buds are rated at IP54, the same as the flagship AirPods.\nPixel Buds Pro 2 Review: Verdict\nIf Google hadn\u2019t touted Gemini integration as one of the biggest features on the Pixel Buds Pro 2, I could\u2019ve scored them higher. These are overall excellent buds that give you everything you want. The size and weight have been dramatically reduced, so they\u2019re comfortable sitting in your ears all day. The twist-to-adjust stabilizer is far from a gimmick. It gives the buds their snug, ear-hugging fit. Navigation has been done so intuitively that it makes me wonder why more earbud companies don\u2019t take a similar, straightforward approach, especially with volume. The sound profile is impressive, with the deep, punchy bass being the star of the show. And the noise-canceling is so powerful that you feel transported into a private vacuum.\nWhen facing off against the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, the Pixel Buds provided a better fit, battery life, and value, making them pretty much the premium earbuds to have.\nMy only gripe is that the Gemini integration is half as attractive as advertised. It\u2019s far from being \u2018hands-free\u2019 if you can\u2019t ask a single follow-up question without getting your hands involved. Plus, you can\u2019t interrupt it with your voice regardless of how long its response is, which is fairly annoying.\nI can\u2019t ignore the Gemini integration and enjoy the rest of what these buds offer because I imagine the AI integration is one of the reasons they\u2019re priced at $230. Google didn\u2019t have to follow suit and mindlessly stuff its product with AI if the integration wasn\u2019t providing much value."

      "text": "There\u2019s an app for everything. For tracking how many steps you take in a day; for watching your cat get into mischief while you\u2019re at work; for drowning your friends in a constant stream of memes they\u2019ll never look at. The list goes on, and, naturally, that very long list includes your wireless earbuds/headphones. Audio companion apps aren\u2019t necessarily new\u2014they\u2019ve been around for a few years now\u2014but they might as well be for most people who own Bluetooth earbuds or headphones.\nAnd, you know what? I can\u2019t say I blame anyone who doesn\u2019t use or even know about their earbuds\u2019 corresponding app. I am firmly in the camp of having way too many apps on my phone as it is, and the idea of adding one more feels absurd at best. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that I need to know what those audio apps do for my job, I probably wouldn\u2019t bother unpacking them, either. But that is what I do for a living, and I have bothered, and I\u2019m here to tell you that you\u2019re missing out.\nDon\u2019t You Dare Say \u201cBloatware\u201d\nThere is an unwieldy world of app bloat out there, but don\u2019t let that fool you when it comes to audio companion apps. If you can stomach adding one more app to your phone, you\u2019ll be rewarded not just with extra features but sometimes with unlocking the true potential of the thing you purchased. One big way audio apps do that is through in-app hearing tests.\nA major part of whether you like a pair of earbuds or headphones has nothing to do with the buds and everything to do with your personal hearing. Depending on your age and whether you spent a lot of time at loud concerts or working in construction, you hear frequencies differently than others. That means, in order to get the best possible sound out of a pair of earbuds or headphones, you need an audio device that tailors the EQ and tuning to your hearing. And on that front, plenty of earbuds can do just that\u2026 with the help of an app, of course.\nTake the OnePlus Buds 4, a pair of earbuds that I recently reviewed. While the buds sound pretty good out of the box, it wasn\u2019t until I bothered to download the OnePlus companion app and went through a short hearing test that I found out how good (exactly) they sound. It wasn\u2019t night and day, but it was a huge improvement over the out-of-box tuning, which proves to me that personalized EQ isn\u2019t just a gimmick. While all personalized EQ apps are a little different, they usually involve some test that plays a sound and then has you submit feedback on whether or not you can hear that sound. Using that profile, audio apps can then augment the frequencies you struggle with to create a fuller sound profile.\nAnd while the OnePlus Buds 4 audio app is the last app I used to do a hearing test, it\u2019s by no means the only one out there. If you\u2019re a fan of Nothing\u2019s earbuds, for example, you can download the Nothing X app and get cracking with that hearing test. Or, if you\u2019re like many people out there and you use AirPods, Apple has its own version of custom EQ (built into iOS and not an app, per se) that it frames more as an accessibility feature. This five-minute hearing test only works with the AirPods Pro 2, though\u2014sorry, literally everyone else.\nBut even if you can\u2019t take advantage of a hearing test provided by an app directly, you can usually choose a custom EQ inside most apps that fits your particular hearing abilities. My recommendation, if your earbuds don\u2019t have a hearing test built in, is to download the Mimi app and have it assess your hearing and then use those recommendations to custom equalize your buds. That\u2019s a lot more involved than the former method, but believe me when I say it is worth the effort.\nSometimes More Is Actually Better\nIf you\u2019re as skeptical of bloatware as I am, you might assume that any additional \u201ccontent\u201d inside your earbuds\u2019 or headphones\u2019 audio apps is absolute garbage, but I\u2019m here to tell you that you may want to give that thought another think. Soundcore was the most recent company to surprise me with its audio companion app offerings, and there is a lot going on in there.\nOne of the coolest features inside Soundcore\u2019s companion app is a whole lot of white noise. For some people, that may be a big shrug, but for those of us who absolutely, positively need white noise of some kind to get to sleep, it\u2019s a veritable paradise. You can choose between white noise sounds with a nature theme like \u201cCampfire Feast\u201d or \u201cOcean Chime,\u201d or even get scientific with \u201cAI Brainwave Audio,\u201d which takes advantage of binaural beats. If you\u2019re not familiar, binaural beats are supposed to trick your brain into hearing certain frequencies that promote focus or relaxation. These are obviously all things you can just search on YouTube if you\u2019re feeling the need to relax or tune out noise, but there\u2019s something to be said about having them all in one place in an app that you got for free (no ad interruptions, either).\nAnd beyond just enjoying free content, having a solid companion app also enables a whole new genre of devices like Soundcore Sleep A30 buds, which extend their battery life to 9 hours by being able to download sounds from their app and play them locally on the buds. Without that app-enabled feature, the earbuds get just 6.5 hours of battery life on a full charge\u2014hardly enough for most people to consider a full night\u2019s sleep. Not everyone will want earbuds to help them sleep, but again, without an app, the people who do want them may have a diminished experience.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s pretty clear that no one requires an app to enjoy listening through a pair of earbuds or headphones, but that doesn\u2019t mean that ignoring them is the right move. The wireless audio market is incredibly saturated in the year of our lord 2025, which makes it annoying when you\u2019re trying to sift through the chum and find out which pair is right for you. On the bright side, it has forced wireless audio companies to find ways of making their earbuds and headphones stand out, and a not-insignificant amount of that effort has gone into apps. If you\u2019re wanting more from your wireless audio, give the apps an ear, because you might just like what you hear."

      "text": "There are lots of different types of speakers out there for lots of different kinds of people. You\u2019ve got rugged speakers for the outdoorsmen and doomsday preppers; you\u2019ve got little speakers for anyone that needs to travel light; you\u2019ve got party speakers for anyone that needs to annoy the ever-loving-shit out of their neighbors. And, of course, you have your regular old portable Bluetooth speakers for your everyday carry\u2014sorry for the loaded terminology, pun intended. It\u2019s hard to stand out in a field as saturated as Bluetooth speakers, and it\u2019s questionable that you\u2019d even want to, but sometimes just a little bit of flair goes a long way, and I can think of one speaker company that knows that.\nSee SoundLink Plus (Citrus Yellow) at Best Buy\nBose recently unveiled its SoundLink Plus portable Bluetooth speaker, and while the category may not be the most exciting thing in the world, there\u2019s still a lot to love about a lightweight speaker with great sound that looks more summery than the condensation on a beer bottle in a Corona ad. Based on my testing, that\u2019s exactly what the SoundLink Plus is. Let\u2019s start with what\u2019s new about Bose\u2019s newest Bluetooth speaker. First, there\u2019s the price range\u2014the SoundLink Plus falls between the SoundLink Flex and the SoundLink Max at $269, which makes it more expensive than most comparable JBL speakers, but in this case, you get what you pay for (more on that later).\nBose SoundLink Plus\nBose's outdoor-focused SoundLink Plus is a pricey speaker but it's got great sound and comes in a very nice citrus yellow.\nPros\n- Great sound and bass\n- Appealing citrus yellow color\n- Feels nice in the hand\n- Reverse charges\nCons\n- Pricey for a portable speaker\n- A little too bass-y at times\nAlso new is a citrus yellow color, which\u2014sorry, audiophiles\u2014really steals the show. This color is everything. The minute I see it, my mind melts into a far-off place as though you boiled down a Jimmy Buffett song into a concentrated sludge and then mainlined it into my veins like that nightmare drug from Robocop. It\u2019s soothing, it\u2019s tropical, it\u2019s\u2026 citrus yellow. Your mileage on the enjoyment of citrus yellow may vary, obviously\u2014colors are subjective\u2014but I can say from experience that I pulled out this speaker in front of a few of my friends, and some literally squealed with delight. I\u2019m proclaiming this speaker the grass-type Pok\u00e9mon of Bluetooth speakers, and there\u2019s nothing you can do to convince me otherwise.\nThe only thing nicer than the color is the way the speaker feels in your hands, though. It\u2019s made from a \u201cpowder-coated\u201d steel grille and a \u201csoft-touch silicone,\u201d according to Bose, which helps give it a strong water-resistance rating of IP67, damn near waterproof and dustproof. Beyond that, though, it just feels so freaking nice in your hands\u2014soft and smooth. Every time I pick this thing up, I fondle it for a bit and then force my friends to fondle it, too. They think I\u2019m some kind of pervert for telling them to feel up my Bluetooth speaker, but the consensus is, \u201cDamn, that feels nice.\u201d\nAnd the battery? Also nice. Bose estimates that you\u2019ll get about 20 hours max out of the SoundLink Plus, but that obviously depends on the volume you\u2019re listening at. I\u2019m inclined, after a couple of weeks\u2019 worth of use, to agree with that estimate, though it also depends on whether you\u2019re using the speaker to top off your phone\u2019s battery. One perk is that the SoundLink Plus also doubles as a huge, USB-C battery bank, which doesn\u2019t exactly help my Lightning-clad iPhone 13, but will charge up Android phones and iPhone 15s or newer.\nSee SoundLink Plus (Citrus Yellow) at Best Buy\nBose put \u201cportable\u201d in the official name for this thing, claiming that it\u2019s compact enough to fit comfortably in a backpack or a duffel bag, but you never really know until you try for yourself. I\u2019m happy to report that I fully agree with that assessment. I threw this thing in my backpack and brought it to a park a couple of miles from my apartment and even carried it around the city after work, and I can\u2019t say I ever felt like I was buckling under the enormous weight of Bluetooth audio. In case you were wondering, the speaker is nine inches wide and weighs 3.29 pounds. But don\u2019t let the size fool you; the sound is formidable.\nThe SoundLink Plus has a subwoofer, a tweeter, and four passive radiators, which may not mean much on the surface, but I can verify that all of those together equal some serious volume. You\u2019re not going to rattle the walls of your house or anything, but it should be more than enough for outdoor parties or even going to the crowded-as-f*ck New York beach and competing with your loud-as-f*ck neighbors. I think beyond the volume, though, what I was most impressed with is Bose\u2019s audio tuning. Prior to using the SoundLink Plus, I\u2019d been using a similar-sized Bluetooth speaker from JBL (the Charge 5), and the difference is very clear. If you\u2019ve been using a cheaper Bluetooth speaker and you upgrade to Bose, like I have in this case, I\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019ll also hear the difference\u2014I wasn\u2019t the only one who did.\nAnecdotally, when I brought the SoundLink Plus into the bathroom while my partner was in the shower, she mistook it for me cranking the volume on the multi-speaker sound system in my living room\u2014not just because of the clarity, but because the bass was also formidable. Nearly $300 is a lot to pay for a speaker that you\u2019re most likely not going to be using all the time in your apartment or house, but I\u2019m of the opinion that the Bose name still means something when it comes to audio quality after using the SoundLink Plus.\nIf there\u2019s one knock I will give the SoundLink Plus, it\u2019s that sometimes the default tuning can be a little too bass-y for my taste, but that can also be easily adjusted via the Bose app, to get the EQ to your liking. That won\u2019t be a perk for everyone, but I can get a little finicky about my tuning, so if you\u2019re picky like me, you\u2019ll be happy to know that you have some freedom here\u2014especially nice to know after you\u2019ve spent $270 on a portable Bluetooth speaker. And yes, to reiterate, $270 is a lot of money to spend on an outdoor-focused Bluetooth speaker (at least for most people), but in this case, you really do get what you pay for\u2014a nice-sounding speaker in a great color that you can fondle until your fingers\u2019 content. If you\u2019re comfortable enough financially to pay the Bose premium or just feel like splurging, I think the SoundLink Plus is worth its weight in citrus-yellow gold."
