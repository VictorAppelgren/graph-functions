  "title": "It\u2019s about time \u2014 Why the BBWAA created a Relief Pitcher of the Year award",
  "description": "The Baseball Writers Association of America will vote on the game's best relievers each season. Here's why this honor is long overdue.",
  "content": "Why did the BBWAA need to create its new Relief Pitcher of the Year Award? Ha. Do you watch many baseball games these days?\n\nFor 100 years, the defining question of every game was: Who\u2019s starting tonight? Not anymore.\n\nNow, the defining question seems more like: How many dudes throwing 101 mph will come rocking out of both teams\u2019 bullpens tonight?\n\nRelief pitching now dominates this sport \u2014 how it\u2019s played, how it\u2019s managed, who sprays champagne every fall \u2014 in a way it never has before, in any version of professional baseball that has ever existed. So as I was saying \u2026\n\nThe creation of a prestigious new Relief Pitcher of the Year Award is so overdue, I first proposed this idea to the BBWAA a dozen years ago. It didn\u2019t make it to a vote then. That was our mistake.\n\nBut since then, the prominence of the modern reliever hasn\u2019t merely grown. It\u2019s turned into a baseball remake of King Kong, stomping through town, grabbing every baseball in sight \u2014 accompanied by King Kong walkup music and a light show, of course.\n\nSo last winter, at the December meeting of the BBWAA, my esteemed colleague, Andy Baggarly, brought this idea back into the spotlight, shortly after he\u2019d written a great column on why the time for this award had come. A study committee was formed. Andy served on that committee. I chaired it.\n\nWhat was my argument to the members? Here is the essence of what I wrote to the committee last January. It\u2019s similar to a column I once wrote at ESPN before I first proposed this award back in the day. The wording has been tweaked and updated slightly, from my original note to our committee, to account for the fact that it is seven months later and we have almost concluded another season.\n\nSo why does baseball need another major award? Here\u2019s why:\n\nRelievers are the forgotten men of election day\n\nThe only unanimous Hall of Famer in history was Mariano Rivera. He\u2019s obviously the greatest relief pitcher in the history of relief pitching.\n\nBut if he\u2019s the greatest anything in history and he doesn\u2019t have an award to show for it, that ought to tell us something, right?\n\nWhat it tells us is that our voters keep all relief pitchers in a glass case that says: \u201cONLY OPEN IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unless there is nobody else worth voting for, voters wouldn\u2019t even think of putting a reliever at the top of their ballots. Any reliever. For any award.\n\nHere are the cold, indisputable facts to prove it:\n\u2022 We\u2019re now up to 33 seasons since Dennis Eckersley won the 1992 American League Cy Young Award and MVP in the same year. Since then, only one reliever (Eric Gagne, in 2003) has won a Cy Young Award. That\u2019s now over two decades ago! And no reliever has won an MVP, or even finished in the top three.\n\u2022 In those 33 seasons, just eight relievers have even received a first-place Cy Young Award vote: Gagne, Rivera (1996 and 2005), Zach Britton (2016), Craig Kimbrel (2012), Fernando Rodney (2012), Trevor Hoffman (2006), Randy Myers (1997) and Jose Mesa (1995).\n\u2022 Likewise, in those 33 seasons, only three relievers have even finished as the Cy Young runner-up: Hoffman (2006), Rivera (2005) and Mesa (1995). So again, it\u2019s been nearly two decades since a single one of this sport\u2019s unhittable bullpen monsters even made it to No. 2.\n\u2022 Of the nearly 2,000 first-place MVP votes cast in that time, precisely four have gone to a relief pitcher \u2014 two to Brad Lidge in 2008, one to Francisco Rodr\u00edguez in 2008 and one to Mesa in \u201995.\n\u2022 Finally, back to Mariano: Over his entire career, he somehow never won a Cy Young Award or MVP, finished as high as second in the Cy Young just once, got a first-place vote in exactly two Cy Young elections (2005 and 1996) and sneaked into the top 10 of only two MVP races (2004 and \u201905, when he came in ninth twice).\n\nOK \u2026 need any more proof here? We\u2019ve seen 34 relief-pitcher seasons since Eck of at least 30 saves and ERAs under 1.50. Only six of those relievers even got a first-place Cy Young Award vote.\n\nSo obviously, voters have decided the MVP is a position player\u2019s award, the Cy Young is a starting pitcher\u2019s award and that None of the Above is a relief pitcher\u2019s award.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what to make of relievers\n\nIt isn\u2019t only every October that voters aren\u2019t sure how to measure relief pitchers. It\u2019s all the time. Twelve months a year. 24/7.\n\nAnd for good reason. What tools do we actually have to evaluate these guys? The save is the most overrated stat in baseball. And no one pays much attention to the Hoffman or Rivera Awards, which Major League Baseball created to fill the void that we left.\n\nSo there\u2019s a real need for our award, just to help everyone put these men in some kind of proper baseball perspective. And why does that matter?\n\nBecause if you look at Hall of Fame voting over the past couple of decades, it couldn\u2019t be more obvious that voters can\u2019t figure out how they\u2019re supposed to go about determining what constitutes a dominant, Hall of Fame reliever.\n\nWe elected Rivera and Hoffman. We just elected Billy Wagner \u2014 but it took us 10 years to do that. So clearly, the voters need help. And the current awards aren\u2019t providing any of that help \u2014 because this trend is only getting worse.\n\nHere is just a partial list of the active relievers who have never gotten a first-place Cy Young Award vote \u2014 ever: Kenley Jansen, Aroldis Chapman, Josh Hader, Emmanuel Clase, Edwin D\u00edaz and Devin Williams. Among others.\n\nSo if Hall of Fame voters could look at Billy Wagner\u2019s career and say, \u201cWhoa, that guy won six Relief Pitcher of the Year Awards,\u201d wouldn\u2019t that be helpful to know how people looked at him in the era in which he pitched?\n\nHey, it couldn\u2019t hurt. So why not?\n\nRelief pitching is here to stay\n\nI don\u2019t need to spell out for you how teams have increasingly built their pitching staffs around their bullpens. The average starting pitcher now only gets 17 outs a start. The year Eck won his awards, it was 20. So that comes to 60 more outs a night across the sport \u2014 and about 14,500 more outs every season \u2014 that relievers are asked to get. So I think it\u2019s safe to say that bullpens are turning out not to be some kind of passing fad.\n\nWhich means more and more relievers are going to start turning up on Hall of Fame ballots. So why not give ourselves one more useful tool to evaluate them?\n\nAnd what might that tool be? It should be this very award \u2014 the Relief Pitcher of the Year Award.\n\nOnce upon a time in the 1950s, the BBWAA decided that pitchers weren\u2019t getting their due in the MVP voting, so it introduced the Cy Young Award. Now we have an exact parallel situation with relief pitchers. So what were we waiting for?\n\nThat was the case I made to our committee \u2014 and later to the entire membership of the BBWAA. I\u2019m glad they saw the light when they voted on this idea this month.\n\nYou should know that it\u2019s likely that Major League Baseball will continue to hand out its own relief-pitcher trophies. But I\u2019ve talked to some of the relief pitchers on the panel that votes for the Rivera and Hoffman awards, just to let them know this BBWAA award might be coming. You might think they would feel threatened. Oh, no. Just the opposite.\n\n\u201cThat would be great,\u201d one of them told me. \u201cWe were all closers. So all we do is vote for the guys with the most saves. You guys have a chance to get this right.\u201d\n\nHe dropped the name of a set-up man on his team back in the day who was probably the most dominating non-closer, at the time, we\u2019d ever laid eyes on.\n\n\u201cIf I was voting back then,\u201d he told me, \u201cI would have voted for him. He was way better than me.\u201d\n\nSo why do we need another award? Because the evolution of the sport has led us to this moment. Because the debates should be so much fun. Because we have the chance to do something special \u2014 and not just count up the saves but to \u201cget this right.\u201d Oh, and one more thing.",

      "text": "In 1956, the Baseball Writers Association of America created the Cy Young Award when it became apparent that pitchers weren\u2019t getting their proper due in MVP voting. That history is about to repeat itself.\nThe BBWAA announced Saturday that it has voted to create a Relief Pitcher of the Year Award in each league, beginning in 2026. It will be presented every November, alongside the group\u2019s other awards \u2014 MVP, Cy Young, Rookie of the Year and Manager of the Year.\nThe honor for Major League Baseball\u2019s best relief pitcher is the BBWAA\u2019s first new award since the inception of the Manager of the Year in 1983.\nThe BBWAA conducted an online vote on the proposal over the past two weeks. That balloting concluded Friday, and the results were announced to members Saturday.\nMajor League Baseball has its own awards for relievers: the Mariano Rivera Award (AL) and Trevor Hoffman Award (NL), which are voted upon by a panel of retired closers. The league is expected to continue with those awards.\nAdvertisement\nAs part of the BBWAA voting, members were asked if they\u2019d prefer to differentiate the relief pitcher of the year honor from the Rivera and Hoffman awards by giving out just one award to the best reliever in MLB. However, the vote was to maintain consistency with the BBWAA\u2019s other four major awards by electing one winner in each league.\nThe first voting will be conducted in September 2026, and the first Relief Pitcher of the Year trophies will be handed out in November 2026.\n(Photo of Jhoan Duran and J.T.

      "text": "Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase had perhaps the most dominant season by a reliever in major-league history. He came as close as any relief pitcher has in 15 years to winning a Cy Young Award.\nWhich is to say, he didn\u2019t come close at all.\nDetroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal was a unanimous and deserving winner on Wednesday. Clase finished a distant third. But even a figurative bronze counts as a remarkable achievement for a reliever in balloting for an award that has increasingly become the exclusive domain of starting pitchers. Clase is the first reliever to turn in a top-three finish since Francisco Rodriguez in 2008. No reliever had even cracked the top five since Kenley Jansen in 2017. And, of course, no reliever has won the award since Eric Gagne in 2003. The last AL reliever to win the Cy Young Award was Dennis Eckersley in 1992.\nAdvertisement\nMeasure for measure, Clase joined Eckersley on the very short list of greatest relief seasons in history. Clase posted a 0.61 ERA in 74 appearances. He led the AL with 47 saves. He issued just 10 walks. His Baseball Savant page looks like the standardized test scores for a child prodigy: He ranked in at least the 97th percentile in pitching run value (98th), fastball run value (99th), expected ERA (99th), chase percentage (98th), walk percentage (98th), barrel percentage (97th) and hard-hit percentage (98th). He was the major reason the Guardians finished 82-0 when leading after eight innings.\nHe even recorded a save in the All-Star Game.\nThere are just three relievers in history who have thrown at least 70 innings and finished with an ERA of 0.61 or lower: Clase, Eckersley in 1990 (0.61) and Fernando Rodney in 2012 (0.60).\nBut Clase had no shot at joining Eckersley as a Cy Young winner. That\u2019s because there\u2019s been a clear shift among Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America voters when it comes to sizing up their Cy Young candidates. The award has become a value proposition. And when it comes to stats like bWAR, even a relief pitcher who has a truly transcendent season has no chance of measuring up.\nClase generated 4.5 bWAR, which was highly impressive. It was the most by a relief pitcher since Jonathan Papelbon in 2006. But in 2024, there were nine starting pitchers who generated more.\nI\u2019ve been thinking about writing this piece for a while, and before Clase\u2019s 2024 season, I had planned to cite the example of F\u00e9lix Bautista\u2019s finish in the 2023 AL Cy Young voting. Baltimore\u2019s Bautista was far and away the best relief pitcher in the American League in 2023. He posted a 1.48 ERA, a 277 ERA+ and recorded 33 saves. He appeared on just three of 30 ballots \u2014 all fifth-place votes \u2014 and finished with three points. Obviously, Bautista had no shot at winning the award. But that wasn\u2019t the part that resonated with me. What stood out was that Bautista couldn\u2019t even beat out starting pitchers who might otherwise be considered marginal candidates. Minnesota\u2019s Pablo L\u00f3pez turned in a perfectly fine season in the Twins rotation in which he went 11-8 with a 3.66 ERA. He finished with 11 points in the balloting.\nAdvertisement\nBautista generated 3.0 bWAR. Lopez generated 3.3.\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where it\u2019s almost silly to even bother putting relievers on the Cy Young ballot. They are apples in an orchard of oranges.\nHere\u2019s another fresh example from this past season: Ryan Helsley set the St. Louis Cardinals\u2019 single-season record by recording a major league-leading 49 saves \u2014 an impressive achievement considering that multiple Cardinals (Lee Smith, Bruce Sutter) are in the Hall of Fame. Helsley was easily the most valuable reliever in the NL. He was mentioned on just three of 30 ballots (one fourth-place vote, two fifth-place votes).\nBut like Clase, Helsley never had a chance. Even in recent voting years when there has been no obvious candidate, or when the vote was split among multiple starting pitchers, relievers have had no path to contending for the honor.\nBased on voting trends, it\u2019s pretty safe to assume that no relief pitcher will win the Cy Young Award again.\nNone of this is necessarily a bad thing. There\u2019s no injustice in relief pitchers failing to merit a place at the top \u2014 or anywhere, really \u2014 on Cy Young ballots. It\u2019s not an oversight or flawed logic that explains why no relief pitcher has received a first-place Cy Young vote since 2016 (Zach Britton) or why a reliever can have a truly transcendent season and barely merit anything beyond a fifth-place vote.\nThe Cy Young Award has always been an honor principally reserved for starting pitchers. The only thing that has changed is that the principles have pretty much become unbreakable now.\nSo maybe the BBWAA should do something about it. Maybe it\u2019s time to create a new award to honor the best relief pitcher in each league.\nIt\u2019s true that MLB already has annual awards for the league\u2019s best firemen: the Mariano Rivera AL Reliever of the Year Award and the Trevor Hoffman NL Reliever of the Year Award were first issued in 2014 and replaced the Delivery Man of the Year Award, which had its beginnings in 2005. The Rolaids Relief Man Award, in addition to creating a lot of brand awareness for antacid medication, was given out from 1976 to 2012.\nAdvertisement\nBut MLB\u2019s current awards are voted on by a panel of retired relief pitchers. They do not involve the participation of BBWAA\u2019s voting members. And the BBWAA awards \u2014 MVP, Cy Young, Rookie of the Year, Manager of the Year \u2014 continue to be the gold standard among the league\u2019s postseason honors. Problematic as it might be, the BBWAA awards are now the basis for enticements like the prospect promotion incentive that can net a team an extra draft pick. Paul Skenes, who was named the NL Rookie of the Year earlier this week, received an extra year of service time as a result.\nThe BBWAA awards are the postseason awards. They are the most historic. And they are the nearest to being above reproach.\nValuing relief pitchers has always been a tricky proposition for BBWAA members who are eligible to vote for the Hall of Fame, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see whether Billy Wagner is able to break through next month in his final year on the ballot. But clearly, the association has demonstrated that relief pitchers are worthy of the honor. The only unanimous inductee in the history of Hall of Fame voting isn\u2019t a charismatic and transcendent star center fielder like Ken Griffey Jr. or a durable, generation-spanning rotation presence like Nolan Ryan. It\u2019s longtime New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera.\nHere\u2019s the thing: Rivera never won a BBWAA award. And that makes the lack of a BBWAA award for relievers seem like something that can and should be addressed.\n(Rivera finished as high as second in Cy Young balloting in 2005, when he received eight out of 30 first-place votes. Bartolo Colon, who finished 21-8 with a 3.48 ERA in 33 starts, received 17 first-place votes and won the award going away. Colon\u2019s ERA is the fourth highest by a Cy Young winner in the award\u2019s history.)\nHere\u2019s the other thing to consider: Relief pitchers have never been more important than they are in today\u2019s game. They are pitching more innings than ever. They were changing the composition of major-league rosters so drastically that rule changes had to be put into place to cap the number of pitchers a team can carry. Even with those limitations, one-third of your typical major-league team is comprised of relievers. And for one-third of the league, there\u2019s no chance to be a legitimate candidate to win a BBWAA award.\nEven a dominant rookie reliever has no shot at an award. Just look at this year\u2019s AL balloting. A\u2019s closer Mason Miller struck out 104 in 65 innings \u2014 the highest strikeout rate among all big leaguers to throw at least 50 innings \u2014 and posted a 2.49 ERA while recording 28 saves. Miller appeared on just eight of 30 ROY ballots, received one first-place vote and finished fourth with 16 points. Yankees starting pitcher Luis Gil, who went 15-7 with a 3.50 ERA, received 15 first-place votes and narrowly outpointed Orioles outfielder Colton Cowser to win the award.\nAdvertisement\nGil generated 3.1 bWAR. Miller generated 2.4.\nOne more shiny apple among the citrus groves.\nMy colleague at The Athletic, Jayson Stark, proposed adding a BBWAA award for relievers some years back. His presentation didn\u2019t gain traction. The primary argument against was the concern that there weren\u2019t enough eligible BBWAA members to fill out voting committees for an additional award. But since then, the association opened membership to MLB.com reporters. There are more international media members who have an active card and cover games. There are more \u201cnon-legacy media\u201d outlets who employ full-time writers and reporters. In some markets, the problem has become that there aren\u2019t enough voting assignments to go around.\nThe BBWAA\u2019s awards are valuable \u2014 so much so that Major League Baseball offered to guarantee a certain amount of access (to minor leaguers, to coaching staffs, etc.) to association members in exchange for the rights to fold the awards into an annual Oscars-like show to be held in Las Vegas. A membership-wide vote rejected the league\u2019s proposal. But the exercise demonstrated just how much the BBWAA\u2019s awards truly matter.\nSo let\u2019s expand them. It\u2019s time for an AL and NL Reliever of the Year.\nClose the deal.\n(Top photo of Emmanuel Clase: Jason Miller / Getty Images)"
