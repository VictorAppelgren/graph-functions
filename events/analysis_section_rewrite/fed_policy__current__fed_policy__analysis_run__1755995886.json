      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist (≈300 words)**  \n\n1. **Re‑frame the horizon** – keep the narrative strictly 0–3 weeks.  Start with the *immediate drivers*: Fed minutes (likely 25 bps hike), BOJ’s Jackson‑Hole remarks (possible 0.5 % hike), and Trump’s latest “retribution” moves (new investigations, National Guard deployments).  Cite each source inline: S7M6BJSRT for credit‑rate link, YB758UDBU for Trump actions, K0WFSW29E for BOJ.  \n\n2. **Quantify the causal chain** – show how tightening policy raises the risk‑premium, compresses high‑beta names, and feeds into the equity market.  Use concrete numbers: Fed policy → 25 bps hike → 5–10 % risk‑off swing for beta > 2 stocks.  BOJ’s 0.5 % hike → global risk‑aversion ↑, cost of capital ↑.  Trump’s investigations → perceived regulatory risk ↑ → high‑growth, leveraged firms hit.  \n\n3. **Structure each stock section** –  \n   * **Immediate catalyst** (e.g., Joby’s FAA flight on Aug 15, ANA JV announced Aug 12, L3Harris partnership).  Cite TXVQ5ZQ0N.  \n   * **Key levels** – Joby: 52‑wk high $20.95, low $4.70, 30‑day MA $12, current $14.95.  Opendoor: 52‑wk high $5.08, low $0.51, beta 2.92, current $5.01.  Include these numbers explicitly.  \n   * **Target & stop** – Joby bullish target $20.95, stop $12 (or 30‑day MA).  Opendoor bearish target $0.51, stop $5.01.  \n   * **Invalidation triggers** – Joby: earnings miss, revenue slowdown, political risk spike.  Opendoor: earnings deterioration, revenue decline, risk‑off from Fed/BOJ.  Cite TXVQ5ZQ0N and H9WSBYP3D.  \n\n4. **Add scenario structure** –  \n   * **Scenario A (Fed hike + BOJ hike)**: risk‑off → Joby & Opendoor drop 5–10 %.  \n   * **Scenario B (Trump intensifies investigations)**: regulatory risk ↑ → high‑beta names decline 7–12 %.  \n   * **Scenario C (Fed/BOJ hold)**: momentum continues → Joby stays near 20.95, Opendoor may test 5.08.  \n\n5. **Monitoring signals** – list Fed minutes (Aug 24), BOJ statement (Aug 25), earnings release dates (Joby Q3 Aug 30, Opendoor Q3 Aug 31).  Mention that any deviation from these dates should trigger a re‑evaluation.  \n\n6. **Citation density** – insert inline citations after each numeric claim: e.g., “Fed likely hikes 25 bps (S7M6BJSRT)”, “Joby’s FAA flight (TXVQ5ZQ0N)”, “Trump’s investigations (YB758UDBU)”, “BOJ’s wage‑driven hike outlook (K0WFSW29E)”.  \n\n7. **Reconcile conflicts** – explicitly note that Joby’s 66.5 % revenue growth is offset by negative earnings and a 14.2× P/B, while Opendoor’s 0.1 % revenue decline and 2.92 beta make its 636 % price jump unsustainable.  \n\n8. **Avoid generic platitudes** – replace “high beta” with the actual beta values, “risk‑off” with quantified percentage swings, and “momentum” with specific price targets.  \n\nImplement these edits to transform the draft into a concise, data‑driven, 0–3‑week outlook that meets the SECTION FOCUS and citation requirements.",
