On Tuesday evening, the country icon shared a tribute to her late stepson on Instagram, remembering his \u201clegacy and laughter,\u201d and the time they lived together.\n\n\u201cLast week, my stepson/oldest son Brandon Blackstock went home to be with God. His struggle is over and he is in eternal peace in God\u2019s presence,\u201d McEntire wrote in her post. \u201cThere is no one else like him, and I\u2019m thankful for the time we had together.\u201d\n\u2022 None Kelly Clarkson Tears Up Performing 'Piece by Piece,' 'Tightrope' Before Brandon Blackstock's Death\n\nShe ended her note: \u201cHis legacy and laughter will be carried on through his family. Rest in peace cowboy. Happy trails to you til we meet again.\u201d\n\nMcEntire was previously married to Blackstock\u2019s father Narvel Blackstock from 1989 to 2015. In her post, McEntire shared a carousel of photos of her and Blackstock from over the years, including one sweet image of the pair during a fishing trip.\n\nThe tribute comes a day after she left a comment on a dedication from her son Shelby Blackstock, Brandon\u2019s half-brother\u2019s Instagram. \u201cWe will miss him so much \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc94\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc94,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn his post, Shelby called Blackstock \u2014 who was previously married to Kelly Clarkson \u2014 an \u201cirreplaceable part of our family.\u201d He wrote, \u201cWords cannot begin to capture the tremendous loss our family has endured. Yesterday, we lost a brother, a father, a grandfather, and a son\u2026 [He was] funny, bright, and full of life\u2014and he will be deeply missed.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Rolling Stone confirmed that Blackstock died of melanoma on Aug. 7. The Silver Bow County Coroner, Dan Hollis, said that Blackstock died at his home in Butte, Montana, \u201cunder hospice care, surrounded by his family.\u201d\n\nShortly after Blackstock died, the talent manager\u2019s family shared a statement announcing his death, but shared few details about his illness. \u201cBrandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,\u201d Blackstock\u2019s family said. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\n\nBlackstock and Kelly Clarkson married in 2013 and had two children: a daughter, River, born in 2014, and a son, Remington, born in 2016. When Clarkson and Brandon wed, McEntire said at the time: \u201cTo have my buddy as my daughter-in-law, I mean, who could ask for more?\u201d\n\nSign up for RollingStone's Newsletter.

      "text": "All 274 of Taylor Swift\u2019s Songs, Ranked\nTaylor Swift the celebrity is such a magnet for attention, she can distract from Taylor Swift the artist. But Swift was a songwriter before she was a star, and she\u2019ll be a songwriter long after she graduates from that racket. It\u2019s in her music where she\u2019s made her mark on history \u2014 as a performer, record-crafter, guitar hero and all-around pop mastermind, with songs that can leave you breathless or with a nasty scar. She was soaring on the level of the all-time greats before she was old enough to rent a car, with the crafty guile of a Carole King and the reckless heart of a Paul Westerberg \u2014 and she hasn\u2019t exactly slowed down since then.\nSo with all due respect to Taylor the myth, the icon, the red-carpet tabloid staple, let\u2019s celebrate the real Taylor \u2014 the songwriter she was born to be. Let\u2019s break it down: all 243 tunes, counted from the bottom to the top. The hits, the flops, the deep cuts, the covers, from her raw 2006 debut as a teen country ingenue right up to Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department.\nEvery fan would compile a different list\u2014that\u2019s the beauty of it. She\u2019s got at least 5 or 6 dozen songs that seem to belong in her Top Ten. But they\u2019re not ranked by popularity, sales or supposed celebrity quotient \u2014 just the level of Taylor genius on display, from the perspective of a fan who generally does not give a rat\u2019s nads who the songs are \u201creally\u201d about. All that matters is whether they\u2019re about you and me. (I guarantee you are a more fascinating human than the Twilight guy, though I\u2019m probably not.)\nSince Taylor loves nothing more than causing chaos in our lives, she\u2019s re-recording her albums, including the outtakes she left in the vault before. So far, she\u2019s up to Fearless, Red, Speak Now, and 1989 For the Taylor\u2019s Version remakes, both versions count as the same song. It\u2019s a tribute to her fierce creative energy \u2014 in the past couple years she\u2019s released an avalanche of new music, with more on the way. God help us all.\nSister Tay may be the last true rock star on the planet, making brilliant moves (or catastrophic gaffes, because that\u2019s what rock stars do). These are the songs that sum up her wit, her empathy, her flair for emotional excess, her girls-to-the-front bravado, her urge to ransack every corner of pop history, her determination to turn any chorus into a ridiculous spectacle. So let\u2019s step back from the image and pay homage to her one-of-a-kind songbook \u2014 because the weirdest and most fascinating thing about Taylor Swift will always be her music.\nHow to Watch Taylor Swift\u2019s Acoustic \u2018Folklore\u2019 on Disney+\n-\n\u201cBad Blood\u201d (2014)\nMelodically parched, lyrically unfinished, rhythmically clunky \u2013 this was a mighty strange pick for a single from an album as loaded as 1989. There are a million things Taylor has in common with Paul McCartney \u2013 one is that celebrity grievances tend to sound like a penny-ante waste of their time, even when they\u2019re totally understandable (unless you\u2019re a fan of Macca\u2019s \u201cDear Boy,\u201d where John Lennon is his Katy Perry). The single remix is improved by Kendrick Lamar \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t saving his A-game for this one.\nBest line: \u201cBand-Aids don\u2019t fix bullet holes.\u201d\n-\n\u201cSanta Baby\u201d (2007)\nYes, she made a Christmas album, which is full of contenders for the basement of this list. But an oldie about a gold digger wooing Little Saint Nick was perhaps a dubious pick for a singer still in her teens.\nBest line: \u201cI\u2019ve been an awful good girl.\u201d\n-\n\u201cA Place in This World\u201d (2006)\nApprentice work from the debut, when she was still learning the ropes as a country songwriter. Yet, the seeds of greatness are already there. Historical significance: This was the song where Tay discovered rain imagery, which in her hands was the equivalent of Sir Isaac Newton inventing calculus.\nBest line: \u201cI\u2019ll be strong/I\u2019ll be wrong/Oh, but life goes on.\u201d\n-\n\u201cChristmas Must Be Something More\u201d (2007)\nA hymn about how Jesus is the reason for the season, with the hook, \u201cSo here\u2019s to the birthday boy who saved our lives.\u201d Unlike most boys Swift sings about, Jesus didn\u2019t comment publicly.\nBest line: \u201cWhat would happen if God never let it snow?\u201d\n-\n\u201cI\u2019m Only Me When I\u2019m With You\u201d (2006)\nCould there be a less Swiftian sentiment? For better or worse, this girl is always herself. That\u2019s kinda the point.\nBest line: \u201cI\u2019m only up when you\u2019re not down/Don\u2019t wanna fly if you\u2019re still on the ground.\u201d\n-\n\u201cTwo Is Better Than One,\u201d With Boys Like Girls (2009)\nA long, long, very long duet with former Good Charlotte and Fall Out Boy tourmates Boys Like Girls, who are either from London or Nashville (they seem to switch accents at random). For some reason, they decided to delay her entrance until a minute into the song, arguably the worst decision in the history of decisions.\nBest line: \u201cYou already got me coming\u2026undone.\u201d\n-\n\u201cSilent Night\u201d (2007)\nThis bizarre version manages to miss almost every single note in the melody. They sure were in a rush to get this Christmas album out.\nBest line: \u201cShepherds quake at the sight.\u201d\n-\n\u201cMacavity\u201d (2019)\nThis one will be tough to explain to future generations, but here goes: So they made this Hollywood movie out of the Broadway musical Cats. Full of magic, furry, singing cats. So much fur. So much magic. Taylor plus felines \u2014 it should add up to classic cinema, right? Not quite.\nBest line: \u201cMacavity\u2019s a mystery cat / He\u2019s called the Hidden Paw.\u201d\n-\n\u201cBoth of Us,\u201d With B.o.B (2012)\nNice try at remaking \u201cAirplanes,\u201d but that Hayley Williams lightning does not strike twice.\nBest line: \u201cYour money\u2019s all gone, and you lose your whip.\u201d\n-\n\u201cThe Last Time,\u201d With Gary Lightbody (2012)\nHer duet with the guy from Snow Patrol. Unfortunately, their voices don\u2019t mesh at all \u2013 what, is he auditioning for a Spandau Ballet tribute band? The funny moment is the tr\u00e8s Eighties synth-horn blurp at the three-minute mark.\nBest line: \u201cThis is the last time I\u2019m asking you this/Put my name at the top of your list.\u201d\n-\n\u201cME!\u201d With Brendon Urie (2019)\nOne of those beloved Taylor traditions: the Lead Single That Reveals Absolutely Nothing About the New Album. And for the second time in a row, it\u2019s the weakest track by a mile. Honestly, Taylor would have released \u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer\u201d as the first single from Abbey damn Road. \u201cME!\u201d is her only song title with an exclamation point, an oddity for this most !!! of singers. Even Brendon Urie sounds squeamish, and he\u2019s the guy who once released a song called \u201cFolkin\u2019 Around.\u201d As we now know, she had \u201cCruel Summer\u201d in the can, but opted not to make it the summer jam of 2019 because she decided to release \u201cME!\u201d instead, a decision that will be studied by Swiftian scholars for years to come.\nBest line: \u201cHey kids, spelling is fun!\u201d\n-\n\u201cThe Outside\u201d (2006)\nStill a rookie, still learning, still trying to get away with \u201cread between the lines\u201d and \u201cthe road less traveled by\u201d in the same verse.\nBest line: \u201cNothing seems to work the first few times/Am I right?\u201d\n-\n\u2018ThanK You AImee\u2019 (2024)\nThis track is 4 minutes and 24 seconds long, and involves 5 different cello players. The letters \u201cK,\u201d \u201cI,\u201d and \u201cM\u201d are capitalized in the title, a reminder that there\u2019s an excellent new Kim Gordon album. Sisyphus must appreciate the shout-out, but he\u2019d probably rather roll a boulder uphill for all eternity than hear another song about this feud.\nBest line: \u201cThe blood was gushin\u2019.\u201d\n-\n\u201cHold On,\u201d With Jack Ingram (2008)\nAn early country throwaway, released a decade later on Ingram\u2019s From the Vault: Live 2007-2009. A teenage Swift chirps back-up harmony, doing the part originally sung by Sheryl Crow.\nBest line: \u201cSign our names in the dust on your family car.\u201d\n-\n\u201cBeautiful Ghosts\u201d (2019)\nShe wrote this with Andrew Lloyd Webber for the Cats soundtrack \u2014 as she said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t get T.S. Eliot, get T.S.\u201d\nBest line: \u201cI watch from the dark, wait for my life to start / With no beauty in my memory.\u201d\n-\n\u201cGirl at Home\u201d (2012)\nA perfunctory cheating-is-bad homily, with barely any chorus.\nBest line: \u201cI feel a responsibility/To do what\u2019s upstanding and right.\u201d\n-\n\u201cHalf of My Heart,\u201d With John Mayer (2009)\nThe real prize from his Battle Studies album is \u201cHeartbreak Warfare\u201d; this is lesser J.M., with an underexploited T.S. cameo and an increasingly irritating premise of hearts having fingers, which they don\u2019t. No wonder the girl in the dress cried the whole way home.\nBest line: \u201cHalf of my heart\u2019s got a grip on the situation.\u201d\n-\n\u201cSweeter Than Fiction\u201d (2013)\nA warm-up for the synth-pop of 1989, from the One Chance soundtrack.\nBest line: \u201cWhat a sight when the light came on.\u201d\n-\n\u201cSuperman\u201d (2010)\nA Lois Lane fantasy left off Speak Now, but it gets a real upgrade with her Taylor\u2019s Version vocal muscle.\nBest line: \u201cTall, dark and beautiful/He\u2019s complicated, he\u2019s irrational.\u201d\n-\n\u201cCold as You\u201d (2006)\n\u201cI start a fight \u2019cause I need to feel something\u201d \u2013 give her credit for honesty, even in this raw phase.\nBest line: \u201cEvery smile you fake is so condescending.\u201d\n-\n\u201cIf This Was a Movie\u201d (2010)\n\u201cGood evening, sir. May I help you? You\u2019re a guy in a Taylor Swift song who wants to stand outside the window in the pouring rain, begging the love of your life to forgive your sorry ass? Take a number and get in line. No, that line.\u201d\nBest line: \u201cBut I take it all back now!\u201d\n-\n\u201cA Perfectly Good Heart\u201d (2006)\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unbroken anymore\u201d? Paging the eminent cardiologist Dr. Toni Braxton.\nBest line: \u201cWhy would you wanna make the very first scar?/Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?\u201d\n-\n\u201cWhite Christmas\u201d (2007)\nUnlike \u201cSilent Night,\u201d this was a yuletide carol she could handle, with a straight-down-the-middle country rendition.\nBest line: \u201cWhere the treetops glisten.\u201d\n-\n\u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Live Forever,\u201d With Zayn Malik (2016)\nNeither she nor Zayn sound deeply interested in this dueling-falsettos battle from the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack. Maybe it works in the movie, but who wants to go find out? Really, they sound like two ghosts standing in the place of\u2026sorry, sore subject, let\u2019s drop it.\nBest line: \u201cI\u2019ve been looking sad in all the nicest places.\u201d\n-\n\u201cMary\u2019s Song (Oh My My)\u201d (2006)\nA through-the-years romance, with a sweet homespun touch.\nBest line: \u201cI\u2019ll be 87, you\u2019ll be 89/I\u2019ll still look at you like the stars that shine in the sky.\u201d\n-\n\u201cHighway Don\u2019t Care,\u201d With Tim McGraw and Keith Urban (2013)\nA duet from McGraw\u2019s album Two Lanes of Freedom, with a guitar solo from Keith Urban. The plot: His ex is driving away, listening to a Taylor song on the radio, as Tay tries to coax the woman into turning the car around and going home. Perhaps McGraw\u2019s finest duet since his great lost Nelly jam, \u201cOver and Over.\u201d\nBest line: \u201cI bet you\u2019re bending God\u2019s ear talking \u2019bout me.\u201d\n-\n\u201cChange\u201d (2008)\nOh, the fall of 2008 \u2013 Chuck and Blair were still an item, Suede was killing it on Project Runway, and \u201cChange\u201d was a de facto victory song for Obama, complete with a thumbs-up for the \u201crevolution.\u201d Yeah, those were different times.\nBest line: \u201cThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down.\u201d\n-\n\u201cNashville\u201d (2011)\nA cover of an obscurity by country singer David Mead, tucked away as a bonus on the Target edition of the Speak Now Tour Live DVD.\nBest line: \u201cWas that a blood or wine stain on your wedding dress?\u201d\n-\n\u201cSweet Escape\u201d (2011)\nFrom the same live DVD, a remake of the Gwen Stefani solo hit. Taylor\u2019s vocal sure fits the Gwen just-a-girl sensibility.\nBest line: \u201cI must apologize for acting stank.\u201d\n-\n\u201cI Want You Back\u201d (2010)\nA live acoustic tribute to the then-recently departed Michael Jackson, with a bit of Motown tremble in her voice.\nBest line: \u201cOh darling, I was blind to let you go.\u201d\n-\n\u201cOnly the Young\u201d (2019)\n\u201cOnly the Young\u201d debuted in her excellent doc Miss Americana, a synth-pop tribute to the next generation of political activists. It\u2019s also a clever Swiftian fake-out, giving everyone a totally wrong idea of where she was headed musically \u2014 almost like she was announcing, \u201cNothing to see here, folks. Definitely no keepers left over from the Lover era.\u201d Was she already plotting to catch us off guard with Folklore? Don\u2019t put it past her. But you\u2019d never guess she was about to make an acoustic album full of folk songs about sweaters.\nBest line: \u201cUp there\u2019s the finish line / Our future is worth the fight.\u201d\n-\n\u2018I Hate It Here\u2019 (2024)\nA tale of romanticism gone sour, with a precocious child grown into an alienated introvert who escapes to \u201cthe secret garden in my mind.\u201d The 1830s line isn\u2019t even the real verbal groaner in this song\u2014that would be \u201cif comfort is a construct,\u201d which wins this album\u2019s The Kind Under Where a Tree Has Grown award. But since \u201cI Hate It Here\u201d connects to \u201cThe Lakes,\u201d it\u2019s worth noting the 1830s sucked for Wordsworth and Coleridge.\nBest line: \u201cI\u2019ll save all my romanticism for my inner life.\u201d\n-\n\u201cI\u2019d Lie\u201d (2006)\nA perky early throwaway about a teenage crush, recorded for her debut and briefly released as a bonus track.\nBest line: \u201cHe loves to argue, born on the 17th.\u201d\n-\n\u201cUmbrella\u201d (2008)\nThe Rihanna hit, briefly covered on the Live from SoHo digital album. Her finest Ri tribute remains her 2011 version of \u201cLive Your Life\u201d with T.I. onstage in Atlanta \u2013 sadly unreleased, but a duet that deserves to be enshrined for the ages.\nBest line: \u201cStand under my umbrella, ella, ella.\u201d\n-\n\u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d (2017)\nThe reason fans once cared about rap beefs: they inspired great songs, whether it was Queens vs. the Bronx (\u201cThe Bridge\u201d vs. \u201cThe Bridge Is Over\u201d vs. \u201cHave a Nice Day\u201d) or LL Cool J vs. Kool Moe Dee (\u201cHow Ya Like Me Now\u201d vs. \u201cJack the Ripper\u201d vs. \u201cLet\u2019s Go\u201d vs. \u201cTo Da Break of Dawn\u201d). But this just sounds like a trivial time-waster by her standards \u2013 Swift\u2019s celebrity feuds are not really one of the hundred most interesting things about her. The main attraction is the retro Panic! at the Disco vibe. \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d turned out to be the lamest track on Reputation, but an impressively perverse head fake \u2013 a lead single that ended up having nothing to do with the album, musically or conceptually, making sure her new relationship songs would come as a surprise. To find a comparable stunt, you might have to go back to 1982, when Michael Jackson fooled the world into thinking Thriller was going to be a whole album of \u201cThe Girl Is Mine.\u201d\nBest line: \u201cIt\u2019s much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality.\u201d Oh wait \u2013 that actually is Panic! at the Disco.\n-\n\u201cParis\u201d (2022)\n\u201cI wanna brainwash you into loving me forever / I wanna transport you to somewhere the culture\u2019s clever\u201d\u2014for Tay, that means a fantasy of Gay Paree. But the whole point of this song is that you can make your own Paris wherever you are, just by drawing your own dream map on the bedroom ceiling. And if you have an amour to share the dream with, all the better. \u201cAll the outfits were terrible, 2003 unbearable\u201d\u2014sounds like Taylor found somebody\u2019s Friendster photo stash of crop tops and trucker hats. \u201cDid you see the photos? / No, I didn\u2019t, but thanks though\u201d is being kind.\nBest line: \u201cPrivacy sign on the door and on my page and on the whole world / Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours.\u201d\n-\n\u2018The Joker and the Queen,\u2019 with Ed Sheeran (2022)\nAn Ed Sheeran ballad, refurbished into a sweet duet with his long-running favorite co-star. The video has the same actors who played Ed and Tay as little kids in the \u201cEverything Has Changed\u201d video \u2014 ten years later. Both singers sound right at home with the metaphor of a poker game \u2014 Ed can\u2019t see it in her face, but she\u2019s about to play her ace.\nBest line: \u201cI\u2019ve been played before, if you hadn\u2019t guessed/So I kept my cards close to my foolproof vest.\u201d\n-\n\u201cSeptember\u201d (2018)\nThe Earth, Wind & Fire classic, already covered by every wedding band on the planet, becomes a mournful banjo lament. It\u2019s her tribute to the late great Maurice White, a songwriter who shared her knack for building hits out of quirky details. (Changing \u201cthe 21st night of September\u201d to the 28th is a very Swiftian touch.) Next she might try \u201cThat\u2019s the Way of the World\u201d or \u201cAfter the Love Has Gone.\u201d\nBest line: \u201cLove was changing the minds of pretenders.\u201d\n-\n\u201cStay Beautiful\u201d (2006)\nAn early stab at a take-the-high-road breakup song.\nBest line: \u201cHe whispers songs into my window.\u201d\n-\n\u201cEnd Game,\u201d with Ed Sheeran & Future (2017)\nFuture reaffirms her long-running bond with ATLien hip-hop, which goes back to her B.o.B. and T.I. duets. Plus her trusty wingman Ed Sheeran. She offers an update about her lipstick status (still red! good to know) and her relationship with drama: \u201cI swear I don\u2019t love the drama \u2014 it loves me!\u201d\nBest line: \u201cI bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put \u2018em.\u201d\n-\n\u201cThat\u2019s When\u201d (2021)\nA Fearless outtake refurbished as a duet with her old friend Keith Urban. She pleads for forgiveness after crushing a lover\u2019s heart for no particular reason, in the mode of \u201cBack to December\u201d or \u201cAfterglow.\u201d\nBest line: \u201cI knew my words were hard to hear/And harder to ever take back.\u201d\n-\n\u201cThe Way I Loved You\u201d (2008)\nShe meets a low-stress boy who doesn\u2019t want love to be torture. Alas, this suitor is toast, because he reminds her how much she misses the manic pixie drama vampire she dated before. Sorry, dude \u2013 she loves the players, and she loves the game.\nBest line: \u201cHe respects my space/And never makes me wait.\u201d\n-\n\u201cThug Story,\u201d With T-Pain (2009)\nThe classic T-Pain and Taylor duet from the 2009 CMT Awards, still T-Swizzle\u2019s finest rap performance.\nBest line: \u201cNo, I never really been in a club/Still live with my parents, but I\u2019m still a thug/I\u2019m so gangsta you can find me baking cookies at night/You out clubbing, but I just made caramel delight.\u201d\n-\n\u201cI Wish You Would\u201d (2014)\nOne of her many, many songs set at 2 a.m. \u2013 clearly the most inspiring hour on Swift Standard Time \u2013 with a staccato disco guitar lick.\nBest line: \u201cWe\u2019re a crooked love in a straight line down.\u201d\n-\n\u201cBig Star,\u201d With Kenny Chesney (2017)\n\u201cThis song is about a girl who had a dream and followed it,\u201d Kenny Chesney tells the roaring Nashville crowd. One of those girls jumps onstage to sing along. \u201cMy friend Taylor Swift showed up on my birthday to surprise me,\u201d Kenny explained. \u201cIn a lot of ways, that song and that lyric is Taylor\u2019s journey.\u201d Their touching \u201cBig Star\u201d duet came out on his concert album Live from No Shoes Nation \u2014 10 years after he gave this rookie a break as the opening act on his 2007 summer tour. There is no loyalty like Swift loyalty.\nBest line: \u201cShe signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt.\u201d\n-\n\u201cStay Stay Stay\u201d (2012)\n\u201cBefore you, I\u2019d only dated self-indulgent takers\u201d \u2013 but here she turns into a self-indulgent taker herself and (surprise!) she likes it, a phone-throwing nightmare dressed like a grocery-shopping daydream.\nBest line: \u201cYou came in wearing a football helmet and said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s talk.'\u201d\n-\n\u2018Imgonnagetyouback\u2019 (2024)\nA catchy oddity that resembles Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s \u201cGet Him Back,\u201d except Taylor does not meet this guy\u2019s mom just to tell her her son sucks.\nBest line: \u201cOnce you fix your face, I\u2019m going in.\u201d\n-\n\u2018Foolish One\u2019 (2023)\nSome of the Speak Now vaulties sound like she\u2019s already rehearsing for Red, but \u201cFoolish One\u201d feels totally Fearless. It\u2019s a guileless country ballad about a girl learning to trust her instincts. Can you believe she went from this song to \u201cShake It Off\u201d in four years? Talk about an upgrade in terms of Voices In My Head content. Love the way she wrote the hook \u201cit\u2019s delicate,\u201d then decided to save that line until she could give it a song all its own. Like a lot of decisions she made in 2010, this was a prescient one.\nBest line: \u201cWhen my head is on your shoulder / It starts thinking you\u2019ll come around.\u201d\n-\n\u201cMessage In a Bottle\u201d (2021)\nThe first song Swift wrote with Max Martin and Shellback \u2014 the day she met them. It makes sense she left \u201cMessage in a Bottle\u201d off Red, since it sounds so similar to \u201c22\u201d\u2014 she chose the right one. But it sounds like she\u2019s already stretching ahead to 1989. \u201cHow is it in London?\u201d sounds like a fresh take on the transatlantic rendezvous of \u201cCome Back\u2026Be Here.\u201d\nBest line: \u201cI became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied.\u201d\n-\n\u201cSay Don\u2019t Go\u201d (2023)\n\u201cI would stay forever if you say \u2018Don\u2019t go\u2019 / But you won\u2019t.\u201d A 1989 vault outtake co-written with Eighties hitmaker Diane Warren, \u201cSay Don\u2019t Go\u201d is relatively straight-forward and smooth compared to its peers, with echoes of \u201cMirrorball\u201d in the tightrope imagery.\nBest line: \u201cWe\u2019re a shot in the darkest dark.\u201d"

      "text": "The 50 Greatest Eminem Songs\nThough he\u2019s been a multiplatinum, Grammy-winning star for over 20 years, Eminem is not an unequivocally triumphant figure, either within pop music or within his own mind. Just listen to the vulnerability and self-doubt on his recent single \u201cWalk on Water.\u201d The Detroit rapper continues to make art about how people are driven crazy by weakness and lack. It\u2019s just now he\u2019s finding it harder to joke about the darkness that has always fueled his best work.\nSome fans celebrate only the funny \u201cSlim Shady,\u201d when the musical comedy is quality controlled by executive producer Dr. Dre. They eschew the more viciously somber, rock-leaning character studies helmed by Em and his longtime Detroit collaborators Jeff and Mark Bass. But spend serious time with Eminem\u2019s entire catalogue and you quickly realize that those two sides of his music are inextricable, one always informing the other.\nWhen Eminem raps about violent, tragicomic death, he is furthering a grand murder-ballad tradition in folk and blues music. He\u2019s also, on occasion, regurgitating grotesque sexist, homophobic stereotypes. But for a poor, white, emotionally unstable MC to excel in hip-hop and not be viewed as a villainous buffoon, he must possess prodigious artistic gifts and a real commitment to personal transparency. Throughout our list of his 50 essential songs (originally published in 2017 and updated on the eve of his 2022 Super Bowl appearance), Eminem fearlessly displays that devotion to task and proves why he\u2019s been one of pop music\u2019s most fascinating, complex characters.\n-\n\u201cBully\u201d (2003)\nAppearing on the Internet sometime before its inclusion on the semi-official Eminem mixtape Straight From the Lab, \u201cBully\u201d is the best of the loosies Eminem made during his virulent war of words with Benzino and Murder Inc.\u2019s Ja Rule and Irv Gotti. He dismisses claims that he\u2019s just a \u201c2003 Vanilla Ice\u201d by rhyming, \u201cSo now you try to pull the race card/And it backfires in your face hard/\u2019Cause you know we don\u2019t play that black and white shit.\u201d Then he reflects on how death seems to hover over the genre, wondering if all the beef is worth it. He raps, \u201cNow what bothers me the most about hip-hop is we so close to picking up where we left off with Big and Pac/We just lost Jam Master Jay, Big L got blasted away, plus we lost Bugz [of D12], Slang Ton [of the Outsidaz] and Freaky Tah [of Lost Boyz].\u201d\n-\n\u2018Fuel\u2019 (2024)\n\u201cI think Eminem\u2019s up there with the best of them,\u201d Diddy told Rolling Stone in 2003. Two decades later, the feeling was very much not at all mutual, when Eminem swooped into blast the disgraced rapper-mogul on a lacerating, acrobatic highlight from his 12th album The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Gr\u00e2ce). Eminem zeroes in on the recent allegations that Diddy sexually assaulted women. After a verse from rapper J.I.D., Eminem raps. \u201cI\u2019m like a R-A-P-E-R,\u201d he says, and the typo is intentional. \u201cGot so many S-As [sexual assaults]\u2026 Wait, he didn\u2019t just spell the word \u2018Rapper\u2019 and leave out a P, did he?\u201d He then offers an R.I.P. to the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, but with a twist that brings the subject back to Combs. \u201cI ain\u2019t tryna beef with him,\u201d Eminem raps, returning to Diddy, \u201c\u2018Cause he might put a hit on me like Keffe D did him.\u201d It\u2019s mean, it\u2019s clever, it\u2019s definitely well-deserved.\n-\n\u2018Godzilla\u2019 (feat. Juice WRLD) (2020)\nA highlight of 2020\u2019s Music to Be Murdered By, \u201cGodzilla\u201d featured a posthumous guest vocal via late emo rap icon Juice WRLD, who had died just weeks before the track was released, and an almost numbingly intense performance by Eminem. He goes off for all of six minutes, his verses getting faster and denser as the song progresses, until he reaches a crescendo in which his words become a fast-forward blur\u2013turning a pretty good song into an absolute showstopper.\n-\n\u201cBad Influence\u201d (1999)\nEminem has always been adept at running dizzying circles around his critics, nullifying attacks by embracing and one-upping them. \u201cPeople say that I\u2019m a bad influence,\u201d he raps on this track from the End of Days soundtrack. \u201cI say the world\u2019s already fucked, I\u2019m just addin\u2019 to it.\u201d Though the beat by Jeff Bass is pedestrian and plodding, Eminem \u2013 the \u201chuman horror film, but with a lot funnier plot\u201d \u2013 has no difficulty elevating it. He\u2019s animated by his outsider status, aiming shots at the \u00fcber-wealthy and hip-hop guide The Source: \u201cAs long as I\u2019m on pills and I got plenty of pot/I\u2019ll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht/But I would like an award/For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source.\u201d He saves his best line for critics like Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White, who condemned Eminem in 1999 for \u201cexploiting the world\u2019s misery.\u201d \u201cYou probably think that I\u2019m a negative person, don\u2019t be so sure of it,\u201d Eminem raps. \u201cI don\u2019t promote violence, I just encourage it.\u201d\n-\n\u201cTalkin 2 Myself\u201d feat. Kobe (2012)\nOn this anguished highlight from Recovery, Eminem unburdens himself with honest, plainspoken revelations. \u201cI almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne/It was like I was jealous of the attention he was getting,\u201d Em admits. \u201cAlmost went at Kanye, too.\u201d He doesn\u2019t blame them for his loss of relevance at the dawn of the 2010s; instead, he criticizes his own uneven output, invokes the murder of his best friend Proof in 2006, and cites his addiction to prescription pills. \u201cThe last two albums didn\u2019t count/Encore, I was on drugs, Relapse, I was flushing them out,\u201d he confesses. Meanwhile, the rollicking, synthesized funk rock backing of Aftermath/Shady producer DJ Khalil plus Kobe Honeycutt\u2019s tortured chorus heightens the interior drama. \u201c[Eminem] told me that he literally had to pull everything out of himself to deliver that record because the music is so thick,\u201d Khalil told Complex in 2011. \u201cThere\u2019s so much music that he\u2019s screaming at the top of his lungs.\u201d\n-\n\u201cBeautiful\u201d (2009)\nEminem\u2019s 2009 album Relapse, where he tried to recapture his salad days as the ribald storyteller Slim Shady, was generally considered a disappointment. But \u201cBeautiful,\u201d a self-produced track that he reportedly made while still addicted to prescription drugs, was poignant, confronting his frequent bouts with depression. Cuing up a heartening verse from Queen + Paul Rodgers\u2019 \u201cReaching Out,\u201d Eminem portrays himself as a modern Pagliacci who \u201chides behind the tears of a clown.\u201d He balances his antipathy toward society with compassionate lyrical warmth. \u201cIn my shoes, just to see/What it\u2019s like, to be me,\u201d he sings in an achingly fragile voice. \u201cBut don\u2019t let \u2019em say you ain\u2019t beautiful/They can all get fucked, just stay true to you.\u201d The rock-ballad melodrama of \u201cBeautiful\u201d points a way forward for what would be his true comeback, 2010\u2019s Recovery. \u201cI started writing the first verse and half of the second when I was in rehab going through detox,\u201d he told The Guardian in 2009. \u201cIt brings me back to a time when I was really depressed and down, but at the same time it reminds me of what that space is like and what never to go back to.\u201d\n-\nBusta Rhymes feat. Eminem, \u201cCalm Down\u201d (2014)\n\u201cIt started off from just doing a dope, high energy hip-hop record into us respectfully competing and damn near battling each other,\u201d Busta Rhymes told Complex about this flashy feat of technical abilities that took seven months. He says Eminem initially responded with a 42-bar verse, so he returned with 50 and the ante kept being raised \u2013 60, 62, 64 \u2013 until it ended up as a tune where each rapper goes for about 2 minutes and 30 seconds apiece. \u201cMy hat is off to Eminem because he genuinely still cares about the music,\u201d said Busta. \u201cHe very much cares about being a thoroughbred MC and wouldn\u2019t ever be the type of artist that has to worry about letting me down or compromising his skill set because he\u2019s trying to do something that people think is cool.\u201d\n-\nEminem, Slaughterhouse, Yelawolf, \u201cShady Cxvpher\u201d (2014)\nTo promote the 2014 compilation Shady XV, the members of Slaughterhouse (Kxng Crooked, Joe Budden, Joell Ortiz, Royce Da 5\u20199\u2033), Yelawolf and Eminem recorded extended a capella verses in their respective hometowns for Vevo in the 18-minute video \u201cShady Cxvpher.\u201d In his seven delirious minutes, the rapper blends introspection (\u201cBecame a millionaire, went downhill from there\u201d), breakneck double-time rhymes, tasteless barbs at media figures and some brutal honesty (\u201cI think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines/And thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter\u2019s minds/Then I\u2019m like: dollar signs.\u201d)\n\u201cIt\u2019s about longevity. To me, the verse says, \u2018After all the years of classic material, I am still one of the illest rappers to ever do this shit,'\u201d Kxng Crooked tells Rolling Stone. \u201cBeing a wordsmith in rap music is a dying art. Connecting syllables, metaphors, punchlines and similes is a dying art. For those of us who still love rapping for the sake of showing how good one can rap, Eminem is our only mainstream voice.\u201d\n-\n\u2018Stepping Stone\u2019 (2018)\nEminem\u2019s 2018 album Kamikaze was, as its title implied, a 46-minute bile storm of ego-driven implosive MC pyrotechnics, in which the artist lashed out at a rap game that had seemingly left him behind. But the standout track \u201cStepping Stone,\u201d took a more generous tone, as Eminem laid out a deeply felt apology to his estranged old crew D12. \u201cTo my partners, I can\u2019t say how sorry I am / This is not how I planned for our story to end,\u201d he rapped over a propulsive beat. For a guy who made his bones shocking, and at times blaming, the world for his own problems, the contrition and introspect were strikingly welcome.\n-\nThe High & Mighty feat. Eminem, \u201cThe Last Hit\u201d (1999)\nAs his fame ballooned at the turn of the millennium, Eminem was still reaching back to the (mostly East Coast) underground that had inspired and sustained him since before his 1996 debut album Infinite. Hence, this fiery boom-bap scratchfest from the Rawkus debut of Philadelphia duo High & Mighty. With samples of EPMD\u2019s \u201cNever Seen Before\u201d and Hambone\u2019s Salsoul disco-funk banger \u201cHey Music Man\u201d lending the veneer of a vintage buddy-cop flick, Eminem trades bars with Mr. Eon. However, this is Slim Shady\u2019s showcase and he goes bonkers, gobbling acid and snatching mics: \u201cEscaped Bellevue, stuffed the nurse in a purse/Disperse like I added too many words in a verse.\u201d\n-\n\u201cMy Fault\u201d (1999)\nThe Slim Shady LP\u2018s 46-second \u201cLounge (Skit)\u201d actually spurred Eminem to write \u201cMy Fault,\u201d the intricate story song that follows it on the tracklist. The skit\u2019s silly tune, sung by Bass Brothers producer Jeff Bass (\u201cI never meant to give you mushrooms, girl\u201d) got Em thinking about the time one of his friends had a bad drug trip. \u201cHe was talking about how worthless he was and how fucked up his life was,\u201d Eminem said in the 2006 David Stubbs book Eminem: The Stories Behind Every Song. In \u201cMy Fault,\u201d the friend\u2019s gender is flipped into Susan, one of four characters Em alternately describes, comically and grotesquely, throughout the song\u2019s narrative of a unruly rave party.\n-\n\u201cInfinite\u201d (1996)\nThe opening track of Eminem\u2019s 1996 indie-label debut establishes his bona fides as a skillful, complex rhymer who specializes in visceral, imagistic lyrics. \u201cI travel through your mind and to your spine like siren drills/I\u2019m slimin\u2019 grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects/And twistin\u2019 necks of rappers/\u2019Til their spinal column disconnects,\u201d he snaps on the opening verse. Produced by D12\u2019s Denaun \u201cKon Artis\u201d Porter, Eminem\u2019s voice has a more nasal timbre, balanced on a sumptuous sample of Les Baxter\u2019s \u201cHot Wind\u201d from the 1969 bikesploitation flick Hell\u2018s Belles. \u201cIf you ever listen to Michael Jackson before he was Michael Jackson, or Prince, they were younger-sounding, but you can tell there\u2019s something there,\u201d Jeff Bass, one-half of the album\u2019s executive producers the Bass Brothers, told Rolling Stone. \u201cWhen I hear Eminem from 20 years ago, I can hear Eminem today. I can hear the nuances in his tone, and his rhythm was insane, and this is him starting out as a kid. We recognized that there was something there that was special.\u201d\n-\n\u201cStimulate\u201d (2002)\nAn underrated gem, \u201cStimulate\u201d appeared as a bonus track on the 8 Mile soundtrack, overshadowed by the more explicitly inspirational maxims of \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d \u201cStimulate\u201d methodically reflects the approach and attitude underpinning Eminem\u2019s complex, singular human experience, conveying that sober message with the vitality of his comic rants. It\u2019s a sound of regret and confidence, depletion and resolve, uncertainty and power, swirling in an unsteady cocktail. Rather than escalating any one mood, the song stays dysphoric and ambiguous. The woozy, flanging guitar tone and overall production suggests a sedated edginess, as Eminem\u2019s voice shows signs of cracking. The sonic unease contradicts Em\u2019s lyrics \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m just partying,\u201d the Slick Rick-referencing \u201cI\u2019m just a man who\u2019s on the mic\u201d \u2013 as if he were recognizing that the expressive form he once loved had become its own kind of cage.\n-\nD12, \u201cMy Band\u201d (2004)\nOn their highest charting single, Detroit horrorcore troupe D12, which Eminem joined in 1996 and used to develop his Slim Shady alias, addresses the rock-band malady of \u201clead singer syndrome.\u201d \u201c\u2018My Band'\u201d is a parody, but as with any good joke, there are truths within it,\u201d Tour\u00e9 wrote in a 2004 Rolling Stone profile of D12. \u201cFor example, at the concert, an unscientific poll of people in the VIP room found most couldn\u2019t name any of the members of D12. A few recognized Bizarre, who stands out because of his twisted imagination, and Proof, well known to be Eminem\u2019s best friend. But two people asked me if I was a member of D12.\u201d The group was sanguine about the whole situation. \u201cWe grew up together, lived together, flipped burgers together,\u201d Kuniva said of the relationship with Em. \u201cWe used to just sit on the porch and drink and think about hip-hop, think about makin\u2019 it. There\u2019s a bond there that nobody can break. \u2026 He knows [that] without D12 there wouldn\u2019t be a Slim Shady.\u201d\n-\nMissy Elliott feat. Eminem, \u201cBusa Rhyme\u201d (1999)\nMissy Elliott was a key black artist to co-sign Eminem early on. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t even come out with \u2018My Name Is\u2019 yet,\u201d she said in a Billboard interview. \u201cI heard something of his and instantly told [producer] Tim[baland], \u2018I need this guy on my album \u2026 He\u2019s special.'\u201d Though the rappers were from different galaxies, Missy might be pop\u2019s most hospitably freaky host; and here, she intros, sings the chorus, boosts the joie de vivre on the bridge and shouts support for her crude young guest. First up, Eminem blacks out in Slim Shady mode over Timbaland\u2019s jovial synth-bass blurt. But after Missy interjects to lighten the mood, the shrewdly bold Timbaland switches mid-song into a dramatically charged, breakbeat chase scene: \u201cI\u2019m homicidal and suicidal with no friends,\u201d Shady spits with sharpened mania. \u201cHolding a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends \u2026 Fucking mad dog, foaming at the mouth/Fuck mouth, my whole house is foaming at the couch.\u201d\n-\nOldWorlDisorder feat. Eminem, \u201c3hree6ix5ive\u201d (1998)\nBefore The Slim Shady LP, Eminem used the rap underground as a test audience for his new alter ego. One example features Skam, the Miami rapper-visual artist namechecked in \u201cStan,\u201d under the group moniker OldWorlDisorder. Here, Slim Shady adopts an Andre 3000 lyric \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m just releasing anger!\u201d \u2013 as his modus operandi. Another particularly gleeful example comes toward the song\u2019s end: \u201cI\u2019ll take it back before we knew each other\u2019s name/Run in the ultrasound and snatch you out your mother\u2019s frame/I\u2019ll take it further back than that, back to lovers\u2019 lane/To the night you was thought up and cock-block your father\u2019s game.\u201d In a MySpace interview, producer DJ Spinna remembers Em being \u201con point and quiet.\u201d Meanwhile, his barbs were becoming more distinctively violent and outrageous.\n-\n\u201cMockingbird\u201d (2005)\nSome critics dismissed this song from Em\u2019s transitional fifth album Encore as just a mawkish exploitation of his daughter Hailie Jade. But what Eminem told Rolling Stone was \u201chis most emotional song ever\u201d was vulnerably fair-minded and delicately constructed. Here, he approaches the track like a stage actor digging into the nuances of a role, which is ultimately the key to our belief that he cares as much about being a real father as about being a privileged, embattled pop star firing cheap shots at his kid\u2019s troubled mom. In other words, he keeps his bullshit in check and comes across like the everyday Marshall Mathers, a 32-year-old single dad still dealing with a dumpster-fire marriage, but also a mature adult who is capably raising three kids \u2013 Hailie, niece Alaina (who is also mentioned in the song) and half-brother Nate. What\u2019s more, at least for this song, he makes that normcore guy just as compelling as the unhinged maniac he usually plays at work.\n-\n\u201cHeadlights\u201d feat. Nate Ruess (2013)\nContrary to his well-earned reputation as a fearless cultural provocateur, Eminem has long written sentimental songs that give context and nuance to his emotional outbursts. \u201cHeadlights\u201d from The Marshall Mathers LP2 may be the most necessary addition to this less-celebrated aspect of his canon because he finally tries to make amends with his mother \u2013 whom he had mocked mercilessly on 1999\u2019s \u201cMy Name Is,\u201d then excoriated, in heartbreaking fashion, on 2002\u2019s \u201cCleanin\u2019 Out My Closet.\u201d Em\u2019s use of Debbie Mathers as a musical antagonist frayed their relationship and resulted in a lawsuit, but on \u201cHeadlights\u201d he apologizes for his part in their estrangement. \u201cI went in head first/Never thinking about who what I said hurt/And what verse/My ma probably got it the worst,\u201d he raps. He doesn\u2019t downplay their brutal conflicts, like how she kicked him out on Christmas Eve when he was a teenager, and how they\u2019ve barely spoken since his career took off. But he resists indulging in the kind of blind rage that he\u2019s unleashed in the past. \u201cI hope you get this message that I will always love you from afar,\u201d he concludes. When asked about \u201cHeadlights\u201d during a SiriusXM Town Hall session, Eminem responded, \u201cWhat I said on the record is what I have to say about that. \u2026 There\u2019s no need for me to elaborate on it.\u201d\n-\n\u201cLove Game\u201d feat. Kendrick Lamar (2013)\nThis deranged dark comedy about how dangerous love can be isn\u2019t what most fans expected from two of hip-hop\u2019s most skilled lyricists. You can thank Rick Rubin, who sent Eminem the cheery, oldie-but-goodie loop (built on Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders\u2019 1965 smash \u201cA Groovy Kind of Love\u201d) because he couldn\u2019t hear anyone else over it. (\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to hear Jay-Z on that record,\u201d he said to Complex.) But it was Em\u2019s idea to feature Kendrick Lamar, whom he\u2019d recently met, to Rubin\u2019s surprise. Even Em got more than he bargained for out of the collaboration. When the two MCs met at the studio, Eminem kicked out Lamar\u2019s crew, as if to see whether his guest indeed wrote his own lyrics. Not only did Em get a hook and an outrageous Slim Shady-esque verse from Lamar, but he also had a song that forced listeners to reckon with the conceptual genius of both rappers.\n-\n\u201cSo Far\u201d (2013)\nIn 2013, Jay-Z and Eminem became the first examples of what happens when the most famous rappers in the world are over 40. While the former embraced his maturity by collecting modern art and basketball arenas, Eminem brilliantly cut a figure as a confused hermit over the churning Joe Walsh riffs of \u201cSo Far.\u201d Here, he raps about a fan noticing his crow\u2019s feet, his inability to understand downloads and Facebook, and still feeling bad when pretty girls catch him picking his nose. Or, as he says to Zane Lowe, \u201cI\u2019m complaining about shit that I have no business really complaining about.\u201d\n-\n\u201cLove the Way You Lie\u201d feat. Rihanna (2010)\nThe blockbuster collaboration between Eminem and Rihanna grew out of a loop that the British producer Alex Da Kid brought to songwriter Skylar Grey, which inspired her to write about her mistreatment by the music industry. When Eminem got the track, he wanted it for his Recovery album, but felt that only Rihanna could bring the necessary emotion. The song\u2019s central metaphor shifted with Rihanna\u2019s participation and became more explicitly about the violence that can erupt between two romantic partners \u2013 Eminem drew on his experiences with his ex-wife and lyrical foil Kim, while Rihanna\u2019s memories of the violence at the hands of then-boyfriend Chris Brown tinged her unforgettable wails on the song\u2019s chorus. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019ve both experienced on different sides of the table,\u201d Rihanna told Access Hollywood in 2010. \u201c[Eminem] pretty much just broke down the cycle of domestic violence, and it\u2019s something that people don\u2019t have a lot of insight on.\u201d\n-\nNicki Minaj feat. Eminem, \u201cRoman\u2019s Revenge\u201d (2010)\nOn \u201cRoman\u2019s Revenge,\u201d the throwdown between two of the 21st century\u2019s most technically proficient crossover MCs, Eminem and the then-ascendant Nicki Minaj trade barbs (and au courant references to iPods and Giants quarterback Eli Manning, as well as a shout-out to Busta Rhymes\u2019 verse on A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s \u201cScenario\u201d) over a malfunctioning-Nintendo beat crafted by Swizz Beatz. \u201cAbsolutely the most fun song on Pink Friday \u2013 it gave me life, dahling,\u201d Minaj said, in her Roman Zolanski persona, during a 2010 MTV interview. After clarifying that she collaborated with \u201cSlim Shady\u201d not Eminem, Minaj was asked who offered up the \u201ccrazier\u201d character. She broke up laughing and exclaimed, \u201cIt has got to be Slim!\u201d\n-\nBad Meets Evil, \u201cScary Movies\u201d (1999)\nFor some, Royce the 5\u20199\u2033 was still the best MC in Detroit in August of 1998, when he and Eminem paid a rite-of-passage studio visit to Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Garcia\u2019s influential New York underground radio show. Em and Royce flung freestyle spittle for 12 relentless minutes, stoked by what bystander Noah Callahan-Bever called \u201ca pharmacopeia of drugs.\u201d Just more than a year after that dazzling display and the transformative impact of The Slim Shady LP (which featured Royce on the track \u201cBad Meets Evil\u201d), the duo released an indie 12-inch. The B-side, \u201cScary Movies,\u201d was the keeper, a peak indie-\u201999 banger, with a strings-swept, RZA-gritty thump and some of Em\u2019s most ferocious rhymes \u2013 \u201cAny man plannin\u2019 to battle\u2019ll get snatched outta his clothes so fast it\u2019ll look like an invisible man standin\u2019.\u201d But playing sidekick to Em didn\u2019t suit Royce and their paths eventually diverged until an eventual rapprochement (and reunion album) after the 2006 death of their mutual friend, D12\u2019s Proof.\n-\n\u201cWithout Me\u201d (2002)\nThe de facto sequel to Eminem\u2019s 1998 smash \u201cMy Name Is\u201d and 2000\u2019s \u201cThe Real Slim Shady\u201d is a manic, quicksilver whirl through Eminem\u2019s shit list, launching acid-laced broadsides and flipping the middle finger at real and imagined enemies, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney (whose wife Lynne took Em to task during a 2001 war of words with Madonna); DJ/producer Moby (who was \u201crunning his fucking mouth\u201d at the Grammys, according to the rapper in a 2002 Rolling Stone interview); the Federal Communications Commission (which levied, and then rescinded, a fine against a Colorado radio station for playing the clean version of \u201cThe Real Slim Shady\u201d); and his mom (who had taken him to court over his talk on \u201cMy Name Is\u201d). \u201cIt\u2019s, like, I need drama in my life to inspire me a lot, instead of just trying to reach for something,\u201d Eminem told The Face in 2002.\n-\n\u201cIf I Had\u201d (1999)\nEminem is known for his mania, his scorched-earth delivery, and for packing syllables into stuffed lines, but he is charmingly even-keeled on \u201cIf I Had.\u201d That stems from the empty space in the production by the Bass Brothers, who helmed most of The Slim Shady LP. Their spare backdrops put a spotlight on Eminem\u2019s tongue-twisting heroics. The rapper articulates a clear class consciousness, though of a type more often found in country music: \u201cI\u2019m tired of bein\u2019 white trash, broke and always poor/Tired of takin\u2019 pop bottles back to the party store/I\u2019m tired of not havin\u2019 a phone/Tired of not havin\u2019 a home to have one in if I did have one on.\u201d But don\u2019t think he\u2019s leading up to some final grandiloquent statement: \u201cIf I had one wish,\u201d Eminem concludes, \u201cI would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss.\u201d\n-\n\u201cRap God\u201d (2013)\nRap God\u201d is a mind-boggling, seething testament to Eminem\u2019s own legacy, the rapper executing one acrobatic lyrical trick after another to demonstrate, chronicle and critique his hip-hop lineage. However he seems to shrug whenever he talks about the song, which was recorded in one take. He says he barely remembers that session; for him, it was just another day of mapping out multiple internal-rhyme schemes. In the third verse of this six-minute exhibitionistic display, he famously references J.J. Fad\u2019s \u201cSupersonic,\u201d rapping at a stunning, Twista-level of speed and agility. \u201cEverybody, every time, when they make a song, wants to say: I\u2019m still here. Don\u2019t forget about me,\u201d Em said to MTV News. Though his pop-culture references have occasionally dated him in the latter part of his career, \u201cRap God\u201d acknowledges the past with a thrilling freshness.\n-\n\u201cBrain Damage\u201d (1999)\nIn \u201cBrain Damage,\u201d Eminem tells the tale of DeAngelo Bailey, a bully who terrorized him in junior high. And in April 1999, a few weeks after The Slim Shady LP hit the charts, the real DeAngelo Bailey stood up and granted an interview to Rolling Stone to confirm that the grisly, over-the-top song, where a young Marshall\u2019s brain falls out of his skull, was at least somewhat based on factual events. \u201cThere was a bunch of us that used to mess with him. You know, bully-type things \u2026 We flipped him right on his head at recess,\u201d Bailey recalled. But in 2001, after Eminem\u2019s star had risen higher and his mother Debbie Mathers was awarded a small settlement over his lyrics, Bailey had a change of heart and sued the rapper, unsuccessfully, for $1 million.\n-\n\u201cWake Up Show Freestyle\u201d (1997)\nIn 1997, a then-unknown Eminem flew to Los Angeles from Detroit to participate in the battle-rap competition Rap Olympics. With the event sparsely attended, DJs Sway and King Tech, hosts of the hugely influential Wake Up Show, agreed to put the rapper and other competitors on-air to help increase their exposure. Eminem\u2019s two verses blended Big L-inspired multisyllabic mastery (\u201cBut I\u2019m more toward droppin\u2019 an acapella/To chop a fella into mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller\u201d) with blistering humor (The duo\u2019s favorite line: \u201cDoctor Kevorkian has arrived/To perform an autopsy on you while you scream, \u201cI\u2019m still alive!\u201d)\n\u201cHis verse stood out because it was hardcore, funny and skillful at the same time,\u201d Sway and King Tech tell Rolling Stone via email. \u201cHumor at that level was really new. People were more impressed with lyrical/metaphor masters at that time. He had that and was adding a weird humor to it, so he definitely stood out. The feedback for weeks was all positive. \u2026 We just remember driving home and saying, \u2018That kid had mad skills, man. It was unusual but dope.\u201d\n-\n\u201cCriminal\u201d (2000)\n\u201c\u2018Criminal\u2019 was my new \u2018Still Don\u2019t Give a Fuck\u2019 for The Marshall Mathers LP,\u201d Eminem wrote in the 2000 book Angry Blonde. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s the last song on the record. It sums up the whole album.\u201d Perhaps by design, \u201cCriminal\u201d comments on the controversy whipped up by Em\u2019s debut, while at the same time ensuring that the follow-up album will generate even more outraged headlines. The first verse\u2019s \u201cHate fags? The answer\u2019s yes\u201d was treated like a smoking gun in op-eds about Em\u2019s homophobia, but that line, just like \u201cRelax, guy, I like gay men\u201d a few bars later, feels more like a shock-value punchline than a sincere declaration. Politically, \u201cCriminal\u201d is irresponsibly scattershot, but as a thesis statement for Eminem\u2019s refusal of responsibility in the name of artistic license, it\u2019s terribly on point.\n-\n\u201cAny Man\u201d (1999)\n\u201cSo, I walk into D&D [Studios] and Eminem is sittin\u2019 in the lounge \u2013 doesn\u2019t look like a rapper, regular guy,\u201d remembered producer Mr. Walt of Da Beatminerz (Black Moon, Black Star) in an interview with Hiphopdx. \u201cI play beats for [Eminem] and he picks the beat for \u2018Any Man.\u2019 I never heard this guy rhyme [before]\u2026 So, he gets in the vocal booth and the first thing he says [in a high-pitched nasally tone] is \u2018Hi!\u2019 I look at my engineer like, \u2018Oh my God, what did I just get myself into?'\u201d Eminem goes on to unleash a series of wildly lewd and rude verses, as if he\u2019s hoping to break as many taboos as possible in less than four minutes of classic New York boom bap. \u201cI hope God forgives me for my sins,\u201d he raps. \u201cIt probably all depends on if I keep on killin\u2019 my girlfriends.\u201d The session left Mr. Walt in a daze: \u201cI looked at my engineer,\u201d he said, \u201cI was like, \u2018Yo, what just happened?'\u201d\n-\n\u201c\u201997 Bonnie & Clyde\u201d (1999)\nIf Eminem is the flawed hero of his own music, Kim, his ex-wife and mother of his daughter, Hailie, is habitually his Achilles\u2019 heel. On \u201c\u201997 Bonnie and Clyde,\u201d one of the earliest and most explicitly chilling takedowns of his femme fatale, he plays loose with Bill Withers\u2019 \u201cJust the Two of Us,\u201d fantasizing about dumping Kim\u2019s dead body into the ocean \u2026 with his daughter in tow. Hailie even appears on the track. \u201cI lied to Kim and told her I was taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese that day,\u201d Em told Rolling Stone for a 1999 cover story. \u201cBut I took her to the studio. When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew.\u201d Eminem knew the consequences that such a track could have for his daughter. \u201cWhen she gets old enough, I\u2019m going to explain it to her. I\u2019ll let her know that mommy and daddy weren\u2019t getting along at the time.\u201d Years later, the rapper was more contemplative. \u201cShit, hindsight is 20/20,\u201d he told RS in 2013. \u201cAt that time, that was how I dealt with things. I didn\u2019t really think about \u2026 what was right or wrong or whatever.\u201d\n-\nJay-Z feat. Eminem, \u201cRenegade\u201d (2001)\nThough it appeared on Jay-Z\u2019s pinnacle achievement \u2013 2001\u2019s The Blueprint \u2013 the lyrically astounding \u201cRenegade\u201d was always Eminem\u2019s song. He produced it and recorded the original version with Royce Da 5\u20199\u2033 as the duo Bad Meets Evil. So, when Nas savaged Jay on 2001 diss epic \u201cEther,\u201d charging that \u201cEminem murdered you on your own shit,\u201d it was a distortion in more ways than one. In fact, Jay\u2019s verse sketches lucid, entrancing metaphors that work both as introspection and inspiration. Plus, unlike every other major MC who appeared on a track with Eminem, he doesn\u2019t strain to battle on Em\u2019s gloriously spiteful turf. He follows his own artistic path. Good decision since Em\u2019s tightly packed internal rhymes burst with assonance and he flows almost casually yet no less emphatically \u2013 that old familiar ire only pitching up his voice toward the end of his last verse so it feels more earned. On 2009\u2019s \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d Jay-Z gave his official blessing: \u201cHis flow on \u2018Renegade,\u2019 fucking awesome, applaud him.\u201d\n-\n\u201cRole Model\u201d (1999)\nMore than any other major artist, Eminem has consistently toyed with and questioned the public\u2019s desire to turn famous artists into paragons of virtue and wisdom. Here, he fires off absurd insults, injures himself and envisions scenarios where he\u2019s embodying Norman Bates (\u201cMother, are you there? I love you\u201d) or beating up Foghorn Leghorn \u201cwith an acorn,\u201d hilariously satirizing the very idea that younger fans would ever mimic him. \u201cTo me it\u2019s just a rap record. The message behind it was just complete sarcasm,\u201d Eminem wrote in Angry Blonde. \u201cI wanted to be clear: Don\u2019t look at me like I\u2019m a fucking role model.\u201d\n-\n\u201cWhite America\u201d (2002)\nBy 2002\u2019s The Eminem Show, the rapper had faced off against two consecutive vice-presidential wives (Tipper Gore and Lynne Cheney), in their crusades to censor rap. He strikes back in the album\u2019s opening track, where he demands to know how he became one of America\u2019s Most Wanted. In print, his interrogation of his position as a rich and famous white rapper seems almost matter-of-fact. (\u201cIt\u2019s obvious to me that I sold double the records because I\u2019m white,\u201d he said to Rolling Stone.) But in \u201cWhite America,\u201d set to Em\u2019s own arena rock-sized production \u2013 thudding percussion and the sound of fighter jets \u2013 those same sentiments feel like he\u2019s declaring a state of emergency. \u201cSee, the problem is,\u201d he raps urgently, casting himself as a generational figure, \u201cI speak to suburban kids/Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist/Whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss/\u2019Til I created so much motherfuckin\u2019 turbulence.\u201d\n-\n\u201cMarshall Mathers\u201d (2000)\nThe song carrying Eminem\u2019s birth name reveals the man behind all the personas as he struggles with paranoia and disgust for everyone who is now monitoring his every post-fame move. He petulantly jabs at bubblegum pop, boy bands and fellow Detroit pottymouths the Insane Clown Posse. \u201cI felt that what I needed to talk about in the verses was just me and my opinions,\u201d wrote Eminem in Angry Blonde. \u201cSo I touched on everything from the newest trends in hip hop (which I\u2019m not really with), to ICP, to my mother, to my family members who don\u2019t know me and always wanna come around. I wanted to just spit fire in each verse and have the soft-ass innocent chorus.\u201d He did, in what came to be the mid-period Eminem style, entrancing millions with his passion and skill, while likely alienating others with his casual slurs.\n-\n\u201c\u2018Till I Collapse\u201d feat. Nate Dogg (2002)\nRecorded circa \u201cLose Yourself,\u201d this standout from The Eminem Show was built around the beat from Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d and is, in many ways, a lyrical companion piece to 8 Mile\u2018s tale of trial and toil. \u201cYou gotta search within you/And gotta find that inner strength/And just pull that shit out of you,\u201d Em intones at the song\u2019s outset. But it is Eminem\u2019s ranking of the best all-time rappers, which comes halfway through the song, that made all the headlines. \u201cI got a list \u2026 /It goes Reggie [a.k.a. Redman], Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie/Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.\u201d Chatter among pundits ensued, but Eminem was transparent about his respect for the genre\u2019s greats. \u201cBeing a student of hip-hop, in general, you take technical aspects from [different] places,\u201d he told Rolling Stone in 2013. \u201cYou may take a rhyme pattern or flow from Big Daddy Kane or Kool G Rap. But then you go to Tupac and he made songs. His fucking songs felt like something \u2013 \u201cHoly shit! I want to fucking punch someone in the face when I put this CD in.\u201d Biggie told stories. I wanted to do all that shit. My goal \u2026 is to be technically able to satisfy every underground or every great rapper there is and also be able to try to incorporate it into a song. And make the song feel like something.\u201d\n-\n\u201cGuilty Conscience\u201d feat. Dr. Dre (1999)\n\u201cI remember Animal House when the girl passes out and the guy was about to rape her. He had a devil on one shoulder and the angel on the other saying don\u2019t do it,\u201d said Eminem, defending this song to the Los Angeles Times in 2010. \u201cSo, we did the same thing, only [with] a little more graphic detail.\u201d On one of the most compelling tracks from The Slim Shady LP, Eminem introduces three different characters in three increasingly toxic scenarios with Emimen and Dr. Dre playing the characters\u2019 good and bad consciences arguing with each other. The album version sounds like three creepy skits stitched together by voice-over, but the single version stacks three distinct eras of teenage desire: The chorus is inspired by the chaste yet spiritual \u201cI Will Follow Him\u201d by Sixties teenybopper Little Peggy March; Dre\u2019s beat jauntily interpolates Ronald Stein\u2019s \u201cPigs Go Home\u201d from the Vietnam-era youth movie Getting Straight; while Dre and Em\u2019s lyrical interplay speaks to the increasingly jaded and cynical MTV generation. References to Son Doobie of Funkdoobiest\u2019s widely mocked foray into porn, the 1995 movie Kids and Dre\u2019s own history of assault complete a deft satire of violent male impulses.\n-\n\u201cKim\u201d (1999)\nThough 8 Mile\u2018s \u201cLose Yourself\u201d became Eminem\u2019s Academy-Award-winning song, his most filmic performance was on this six-minute-plus dramatization of his own horrendously dysfunctional marriage to supposed true-love Kim Scott Mathers. His jealous, grindingly detailed rage surges and recedes in an abusive call and response, never losing intensity, as the Bass Brothers\u2019 rock-centric track storms on. It climaxes at the end of the second verse, where he screams \u201cGet the fuck away from me! Don\u2019t touch me!/I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!\u201d Then recoils, in tears: \u201cOh my God, I love you!\u201d The \u201cKim\u201d character (also played by Em) apologizes, but she\u2019s blotted out by her husband\u2019s howling cry. It\u2019s as if John Cassavetes\u2019 A Woman Under the Influence was reshot with Peter Falk\u2019s husband in the spotlight instead of Gena Rowlands\u2019 wife, replaying his climactic line, \u201cI\u2019ll kill ya, and I\u2019ll kill these sons-o\u2019-bitchin\u2019 kids,\u201d throughout a Tarantino-esque blood-spurting third act. Though overshadowed by its graphic depiction of violence against a woman, Eminem\u2019s performance is powerful and intense. The real-life Kim reached a settlement after suing her husband for $10 million.\n-\n\u201cCleanin\u2019 Out My Closet\u201d (2002)\nAn innately combative MC, Eminem dreamed up his alter ego Slim Shady so he could unload on the world with impunity \u2013 morality police, music critics, other white rappers. But his true-north antagonists have always been wife Kim and mom Debbie. And of all the songs about his mother \u2013 both absurd and apologetic \u2013 \u201cCleanin\u2019 Out My Closet\u201d is the most deeply affecting, even becoming a Top Ten pop hit. DJ Head\u2019s syncopated, almost delicate drum loop darts around the dark, spare instrumentation (bass, guitar, keyboards played by co-producer Jeff Bass), while Eminem excavates a lifetime of debilitating parental emotions. The song\u2019s tone nimbly fluctuates, especially with the haunting \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mama,\u201d chorus. Finally, there\u2019s the climactic betrayal \u2013 when his mom, according to Em, tells him that she wishes he\u2019d died instead of his uncle/best friend Ronnie (who committed suicide in 1991). Eminem barks his chilling reply into the void, \u201cWell, guess what? I am dead \u2013 dead to you as can be!\u201d In 2014, fellow Detroit native Angel Haze was inspired by to revive and revise \u201cCleaning Out My Closet\u201d to tell her own tale, one of being sexually abused as a child. \u201cI was so angry,\u201d she told The Telegraph. \u201cIt was like catharsis to listen to [Eminem].\u201d\n-\n\u201cGet You Mad\u201d (1999)\nFor this loony appearance on This or That, the Interscope-backed mixtape from influential Bay Area radio hosts Sway and King Tech, Eminem lays down a proper studio recording of some reference-packed bars initially spit for their Wake Up Show. Like the hip-hop version of his eventual pop-star takedowns, Em pokes fun at the latest round of rap dramas, takes down the current crop of platinum MCs, adds kindling to some of his earliest intra-industry feuds, throws out some tasteless jokes and lacerates the record business (\u201cDon\u2019t act like a fan, you wanna get signed/Get the whitest A&R you can find, pull him aside and rap as wack as you can\u201d). \u201cAll we did was reach out to people that we knew were dope, and were gonna last,\u201d producer King Tech told HipHopDX about making their 1999 compilation, which also featured early performances from Tech N9ne and Crooked I. \u201cI\u2019m from an era where if the beat is bangin\u2019, just let him roll. Let him do what he does. I remember him callin\u2019 me, \u2018Tech, you think I gotta change the hook? I might\u2019ve been too crazy.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Kid, I love that shit!'\u201d\n-\n\u201cBitch Please II\u201d feat. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, Xzibit (2000)\nBeyond some of the greatest collaborators of Dr. Dre\u2019s solo peaks perfectly complementing each other, \u201cBitch Please II\u201d captures the brash undercard confidence that makes Em\u2019s unapologetic attitude so bracing. That take-me-or-leave-me armor works, in large part, because he constantly accents his cynicism with humor: his Snoop Dogg-tweaking opening lines and off-key Nate Dogg harmonizing envelope a stolidly serious Dre production in Em\u2019s waggish glee. At his core, Eminem wants you to see that he\u2019s just joking \u2014 \u201csomewhere deep down there\u2019s a decent human being in me\u201d \u2014 without sacrificing any of his music\u2019s outrageously rebellious spark and impact.\n-\n\u201cThe Way I Am\u201d (2000)\n\u201cIf you think I\u2019m an asshole, then I\u2019m gonna show you an asshole,\u201d he told SPIN of his motivation behind the angst-ridden 2000 single that adapts lines from Eric B. & Rakim\u2019s \u201cAs the Rhyme Goes On.\u201d \u201cIf you call me a misogynist, I\u2019m a misogynist. If you say I hate gay people, then I hate gay people.\u201dIn the wake of releasing The Slim Shady LP, Eminem became one of hip-hop\u2019s most polarizing figures: PTA meetings were dedicated to his violent lyrics; conservative organizations decried him as poisonous to young people. This was hardly a shock to the rapper. \u201cLook, I know what people say and how they feel about some of the language I use, topics I rap about and stuff I present,\u201d he told Rolling Stone in 2013. And so on \u201cThe Way I Am,\u201d the self-flagellating second single off The Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem beats his critics to the punch. He embraces the role of a villain, happy to aggressively play it up.\n-\n\u201cJust Don\u2019t Give a Fuck\u201d (1997)\nIn the summer of 1998, when Aftermath/Interscope mailed out 12-inch promos of \u201cJust Don\u2019t Give a Fuck\u201d as the first single from Eminem\u2019s major-label debut, he was still a battle-rap rumor. This rowdy-rebel boast was the wider world\u2019s first brush with the wiseass white MC, who instantly tweaks our perceptions, tagging himself \u201cSlim Shady,\u201d his sociopathic alter ego, in the first line. Soon after, there\u2019s a goofier intro \u2013 \u201cMy name is Marshall Mathers, I\u2019m an alcoholic\u201d \u2013 which spikes the mix with a third persona via his government name. This is the foundational head trip: Who is this person? Are all of these narrators unreliable? Though not the pop wallop of follow-up \u201cMy Name Is,\u201d \u201cJust Don\u2019t Give a Fuck\u201d was its own defining shot \u2013 more polished, scintillating and frisky than the version on 1997\u2019s Slim Shady EP (credit to executive producer Dr. Dre). It wildly sprays the sky, with the three-headed rapper waving \u201ctwo Glocks, screamin\u2019 \u2018Fuck the world\u2019 like 2Pac.\u201d\n-\nThe Notorious B.I.G. feat. Eminem, \u201cDead Wrong\u201d (1999)\nEven at the peak of his powers, it was a bold move for Eminem to get on a track with a posthumous Notorious B.I.G. verse. The antisocial jolt of Biggie\u2019s lines on the thunderous \u201cDead Wrong,\u201d produced by Bad Boy Hitmen Chucky Thompson and Mario Winans with Diddy hovering nearby, were among his most potently scathing. Yet Eminem practically matches him, sketching an antihero heel turn that scoffs at norms and good taste. Rather than reaching for Big\u2019s legendarily blunt, declarative phrasing, Em eases into his verse easily, abstractly, as if he were writing a Wikipedia page on theistic Satanism: \u201cThere\u2019s several different levels to devil worshipping. \u2026\u201d But it\u2019s a false sense of banality as the verse winds its way into a maze of malevolence and brutality.\n-\n\u201cKill You\u201d (2000)\nIn late 1999, Eminem called his mentor Dr. Dre. He doesn\u2019t remember what they were supposed to discuss, but he was struck by the jauntily frenetic jazz loop (possibly borrowed from Jacques Loussier\u2019s 1979 composition \u201cPulsion,\u201d as a lawsuit claimed) that Dre was tinkering with in the background and demanded to use it. Though Em already had a triple-platinum, Grammy-winning album and a Rolling Stone cover touting his \u201cdirty white boy rap,\u201d he was eager to warn folks that he was only getting started. (To quote Em\u2019s Angry Blonde: \u201cIf anything \u2026 I got worse.\u201d) To wit, \u201cKill You\u201d uncorks a delirium of comic-book revenge, shading irony with savagery to bait and ridicule his critics. But the track is most fascinating impressive for its absurdly specific and self-aware depiction of an unhinged superstar (though, unfortunately, most of the ire is at the expense of women and features a homophobic slur). Vice presidential wife Lynne Cheney was among those taken aback. During a 2000 Senate hearing, she cited \u201cKill You\u201d \u2013 in particular, Em\u2019s perverse revenge scenario against his estranged mom, who had sued him for $10 million after lyrics about her appeared on The Slim Shady LP \u2013 as one reason the music industry needed a rating and labeling system to protect children from harmful subject matter.\n-\n\u201cMy Name Is\u201d (1998)\nEminem\u2019s 1998 breakout single burst from the earliest meeting between the then-unknown MC and the storied producer Dr. Dre, who had been fiddling with a sample from Labi Siffre\u2019s 1975 soul strut \u201cI Got The\u2026\u201d \u201cI was, like, man, listen, I put this sample together \u2013 tell me if you like it. And I hit the drum machine, and maybe two or three seconds went by, and he went, \u2018Hi! My name is \u2026 My name is \u2026,\u201d Dr. Dre recalled in the 2017 documentary The Defiant Ones. \u201cLike, \u2018Yo, stop. Shit\u2019s hot.\u2019 That\u2019s what happened on our first day, in our first few minutes of being in the studio.\u201d Eminem\u2019s combination of nonstop pop-culture punch lines (he name-checked Nine Inch Nails, the Spice Girls, Pamela Anderson Lee and Kris Kross in the first verse), intricate rhyme schemes delivered in his Michigan drawl, cartoonishly violent imagery and a music video in which he gleefully parodied TV hucksters caused \u201cMy Name Is\u201d to become a parental-advisory-emblazoned crossover sensation and MTV mainstay (albeit with heavy censoring). While it only peaked at Number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, it won the Grammy for Best Rap Performance in 2000, establishing Eminem as one of hip-hop and pop\u2019s brightest talents.\n-\n\u201cLose Yourself\u201d (2002)\nEminem has always drawn a line between 8 Mile\u2018s protagonist, Rabbit, and his own life: The film\u2019s central character was loosely based on his own come-up, but it was not strictly autobiographical. Still, it\u2019s easy to hear much of the rapper\u2019s own grind in the film\u2019s lead single. In many ways, it\u2019s the realism and overcoming-all-odds sentiment of \u201cLose Yourself\u201d that propelled it to become the biggest hit of Eminem\u2019s career and the first rap song to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Eminem and producer Jeff Bass had recorded a demo a few years earlier, but revisited it during the Detroit-based production of 8 Mile; Eminem wrote the song\u2019s confessional lyrics only after receiving the film\u2019s script. \u201cI had to make the song while I was in the movie,\u201d he told Funkmaster Flex. \u201cBecause once I stepped out of that movie I wouldn\u2019t feel like I was in [the character.]\u201d He cut the track in rapid-fire fashion. \u201c\u201dHe came in and laid down all three verses in one take,\u201d recalled engineer Steven King. \u201cJaws dropped \u2013 we were, like, \u2018Oh, my God!\u2019 This story had been building up in him.\u201d\n-\nDr. Dre feat. Eminem, \u201cForgot About Dre\u201d (2000)\nDespite its origins as a hard-nosed diss track torching Suge Knight \u2013 written in secret and presented to Dr. Dre by Eminem \u2013 \u201cForgot About Dre\u201d became the artist/producer/A&R visionary\u2019s career capstone, winning a Grammy and achieving pop-culture ubiquity five years after his last Top 40 hit. \u201cPeople were saying that I didn\u2019t have it anymore and that I hadn\u2019t made a good record in years,\u201d Dr. Dre told Rolling Stone at the time. \u201cI just can\u2019t ignore that shit. \u2026 Now what do you people have to say?\u201d The creeping-outside-your-window ambience he conjures \u2013 like a tightly plotted big-screen adaptation of the Dungeon Family\u2019s vividly sprawling vignettes \u2013 possesses an almost stately, imminent threat. This song a rap fan wrote for a pioneer also might be Eminem\u2019s crowning validation. The artful verse structure he creates for both himself and his mentor allows them to spit scorn or self-affirmation in perfectly calibrated declaratives or dazzling double-time. Plus, Em voices the unforgettable chorus in a battle-rap rat-a-tat that effortlessly ferries a dizzy melodic swoosh.\n-\n\u201cStan\u201d (2000)\nIn 2003, Nobel Prize winner Seamus Heaney was asked whether he though any current musicians had inspired a renewed interest in poetry. \u201c[Eminem] has sent a voltage around his generation,\u201d the Irish poet answered. \u201cHe has done this not just through his subversive attitude but also his verbal energy.\u201d Heaney didn\u2019t cite specific lyrics, but the song most deserving of such high-flown praise is this epic diary of obsession. Playing off what functions as an ironic sample (by producer DJ Mark the 45 King) of Dido\u2019s \u201cThank You,\u201d an ode to simple gestures of kindness, Eminem unreliably narrates the story of \u201cStan,\u201d an increasingly disturbed fan who religiously follows, then feels abandoned by, Em\u2019s unhinged alter ego \u201cSlim Shady.\u201d Eminem, as himself, finally shows up to reply, but it\u2019s too late. The song\u2019s brilliance lies in its panopticon of personas and points of view, which shift from compassionate to cruel to bewildered. When interviewed, Eminem tended to characterize \u201cStan\u201d as a conventional cautionary tale, but he wasn\u2019t very convincing. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a message to the fans to let them know that everything I say is not meant to be taken literally,\u201d he told MTV at the time. \u201cJust most of the things that I say.\u201d\n-\n\u201cThe Real Slim Shady\u201d (2000)\nAfter listening to an early iteration of The Marshall Mathers LP, Interscope boss Jimmy Iovine delivered some grim news: The record lacked a lead single. \u201cI thought that the album was spectacular, but I thought they hadn\u2019t taken it as far as they could,\u201d Iovine remembered in a VH1 special. \u201cThey needed a song to introduce the album.\u201d Dr. Dre agreed: \u201cI knew we had a second or third single,\u201d he acknowledged, \u201cbut we needed that big opener.\u201d The pressure frustrated Eminem. \u201cI can\u2019t give you another \u2018My Name Is,'\u201d the rapper lamented. \u201cI can\u2019t just sit in there and make that magic happen.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t come up with another \u201cMy Name Is\u201d; instead, he topped it with \u201cThe Real Slim Shady,\u201d which became Eminem\u2019s biggest hit to date, reaching Number Four on the Hot 100. Though Eminem would soon transition into making somber world-beaters like \u201cLose Yourself\u201d and \u201cCleanin\u2019 Out My Closet,\u201d \u201cReal Slim Shady\u201d is uproarious, with a carnivalesque synth line and a lyrical nod to a novelty track from Canadian comedian Tom Green. The rapper takes shots at everyone \u2013 pop stars, music critics, Will Smith, himself \u2013 but those freewheeling insults mask a unifying purpose: \u201cI guess there\u2019s a Slim Shady in all of us,\u201d Eminem concludes. \u201cFuck it, let\u2019s all stand up.\u201d"
