      "feedback": "Strong scaffold, but the piece needs tighter, first-principles causal mapping, probabilistic calibration strictly drawn from the given sources, and formatting discipline to lift it to world-class quality. Edit it to (a) map the 4 “Movers & Scenarios” lines to explicit regime drivers (Base A/B AI-driven productivity; Regime B retraining/targeted supports; Regime C broad UBI) and rotate two Up and two Down around the three probability anchors in the material: Base 45–55%, Tariff-escalation 20–30%, AI/EV-led 25–35% (cite NL5YYTLF2 for the three ranges); (b) assign each line a crisp, non-overlapping driver, with concrete watch items and quantified triggers (e.g., AI adoption pace, tariff pass-through speed, policy signaling) and reference the precise data points (e.g., 25% exposure to automation risk, 0–2 month tariff pass-through, June deficit 692.15B, export share 37%, etc.) with in-line IDs; (c) reconcile conflicts by selecting a single, coherent transmission map per line and citing sources for each numeric claim (e.g., Ford numbers from 22PL3Q360 and W2622L6WW; tariff/deficit data from EPJYXB7DX, S15934PBQ, 0J41Q7KTX; policy signals U6HXAJR4J); (d) fix the Swing Trade to the required 10-field format: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100, e.g., Long | 2–6 months | near current price (F) | 8% below | 16% above | 2.0x | Regime shift to Regime C or persistent inflation/hawkish policy | Break above near-term resistance | 60% | 75, with explicit source citations after numeric facts; (e) keep the prose compact, remove extraneous narrative, and ensure every numeric claim has a source tag; (f) consider a tail-risk Down line with a clearly bounded, sourced probability (e.g., 20–30% for tariff risk and a clearly delineated 10–20% inflation/policy tail, justified by the Jackson Hole and central-bank cues) rather than leaving unanchored uncertainty. This will improve coherence of the causal chain, ensure adherence to the SECTION FOCUS format, and deliver a fully substantiated, actionable swing outlook.",
