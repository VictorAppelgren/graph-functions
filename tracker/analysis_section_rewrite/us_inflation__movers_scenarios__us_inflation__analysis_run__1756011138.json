      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but lacks the depth, causal clarity, and source‑anchored specificity required for a world‑class outlook. Tighten each line by (1) anchoring the driver to a concrete, time‑specific catalyst (e.g., “Microsoft’s Q4 2025 Azure revenue hits $X bn, exceeding the 39 % YoY target” rather than a generic “Azure 39 % YoY expansion”), (2) quantifying the impact on the target metric (e.g., “dividend payout ratio rises to 35 % → forward yield 0.8 %”) and (3) citing the exact source ID for that figure. For the Fed‑cut upside, replace the vague “70 % probability” with a range derived from the cited probability (C3ODMIQKZ) and link the 50‑bp cut to a 300‑350 bp spread lift (GX057ADL7) and a 2‑3 pt P/E lift (GX057ADL7). The Rivian downside should specify the exact production milestone (200 k units in 2026) and the credit phase‑out date (e.g., “phase‑out ends Q3 2026”) to justify the 60 % probability, and include the market transmission (margin compression → EBITDA breakeven shift). The auto‑loan rate downside needs a concrete trigger (e.g., “Fed raises rates to 5.25 % in Q3 2025”) and a quantified sales impact (2‑3 % drop → 1.8 % revenue hit on keyless kits). Finally, ensure each probability is grounded in a cited source or a clear scenario logic, and remove any generic statements. This will elevate coherence, causal chain clarity, and source integrity.",
