  "title": "A Meteorite Older Than the Earth Just Crashed Into Someone\u2019s Living Room",
  "description": "The dent it left in the floor will be quite the conversation starter.",
  "content": "Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn when you read this story:\n\u2022 A meteorite that plummeted into the roof and living room of a house in McDonough, Georgia, has now been found to be 20 million years older than Earth.\n\u2022 Researchers who examined fragments of the broken meteorite now think that its parent body split from a monster asteroid (which formed before Earth) about 470 million years ago.\n\u2022 The McDonough meteorite is only the size of a cherry tomato, but its trajectory and velocity could tell us more about larger impacts and prepare us to possibly thwart them.\n\n\n\nOn the afternoon of June 26, something otherworldly streaked through the sky over Georgia and South Carolina. It was glowing in broad daylight.\n\nWhatever it was hurtled through the atmosphere faster than the speed of sound and generated sonic boom after sonic boom. Then, after a sudden crash, one homeowner in the metro Atlanta city of McDonough found that a cherry-tomato-sized meteor fragment had punched through his roof and HVAC duct before leaving a dent in his living room floor, kicking up a cloud of dust on impact. He had no idea if insurance would cover damage done by a space rock that turned out to be older than Earth itself.\n\nWhen University of Georgia planetary geologist Scott Harris got his hands on specimens and dust from the offending meteorite (which had missed the shocked homeowner\u2019s head by about the length of an average sedan), he discovered that it was an exploded meteor that couldn\u2019t make it to the Earth\u2019s surface in one piece and scattered. Harris and his colleagues had been gauging its velocity while they watched it descend as a fireball, or bolide, that burned bright as it overheated from atmospheric friction, setting surrounding gases ablaze. Then they observed what was left with optical and electron microscopy that began to reveal its past.\n\nSome 470 million years ago, the meteor which had perished above McDonough is thought to have broken off an asteroid orbiting in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. That behemoth had formed 20 million years before Earth existed. Earth is around 4.54 billion years old. That makes the meteorite 4.56 billion years old.\n\n\u201cA lot of these asteroids have undergone a lot of collisions, a lot of internal damage, billions of years before they encounter Earth,\u201d Harris said in a recent UGA video release that shows the meteorite and its aftermath. \u201cSo we think it may have been traveling many many hundreds of meters per second, even up to as much as one kilometer per second as it went through the house.\u201d\n\nNow known as the McDonough Meteorite, this fragment still had so much energy by the time it busted through the ceiling that it pulverized some of the wood paneling on the floor. Harris found it to be a Low Metal (L type) ordinary chondrite. Meteorites that are classified as ordinary chondrites have a high percentage of roundish embedded mineral grains. These were once floating molten drops that collided with existing rocks and each other, accreting and forming asteroids. As if witnessing the cosmic spectacle was not enough, chondrules are a giveaway that a rock is from space because they are not found in rocks which form on Earth.\n\nL type ordinary chondrites are extremely common, but few meteorites have come that close to a human being. In 2021, Ruth Hamilton of British Columbia, Canada, was startled awake in bed by what sounded like an explosion, only to find out a meteorite larger than her fist had landed between her flowered pillows. Meteorites have collided with more houses before, including everything from cars to cows, but the first known meteorite to hit a human struck Ann Hodges of Sylacauga, Alabama, in 1954 while she was dozing on her sofa. She was left with a bruise on her hip. The Hodges Meteorite now resides in the Alabama Museum of Natural History.\n\nMeteorites that hit Earth are usually chunks of fractured asteroids. In the process of the larger rocks breaking up, some pieces drift into orbits that cross Earth and may eventually shift to Earth\u2019s orbit as they journey around the Sun. Harris thinks the McDonough impact could give us an idea of how to guard against asteroids that might threaten us.\n\n\u201cImpacts, whether they be large or small, are the only thing that we actually have the potential of stopping if we have enough information in advance about them,\u201d he said.\n\nHarris and his research team are collaborating with Arizona State University researchers to submit their findings and the pending name McDonough Meteorite to the Nomenclature Committee of the Meteorological Society, which will publish the information in the Meteoritical Bulletin. They also plan to publish a paper detailing everything they discovered about the meteorite later this year.\n\nWith more advanced technology and public attention, more meteorites than ever have been sighted and recovered in the past few decades.

      "text": "- A few weeks ago, Asteroid 2024 YR4 made headlines for being surprisingly likely to hit Earth in the next several years.\n- After peaking at an impact likelihood of about 3%, additional data was gathered and the risk was demoted to 0.\n- The risk of asteroid impact can be difficult for non-experts to interpret, and can lead to exacerbated, undeserved anxiety if not properly explained.\nOnce, a very long time ago, a massive asteroid hit the Earth and wiped out the dinosaurs. In addition to functionally restarting land-based life on our planet and setting the stage for humans to eventually become the dominant species, that asteroid made us extremely aware of one thing\u2014we are at risk.\nAs such, we\u2019re understandably worried about asteroid strike. But, for a few reasons, we probably shouldn\u2019t be as concerned as a lot of news outlets make it seem like we should be.\nA few weeks ago, Asteroid 2024 YR4 made headlines as it became likelier and likelier that this thing would hit Earth. Scientists were watching it closely, as it\u2019s impact probability ticked up and up until it fell off a cliff back down to pretty much zero.\nThat peak likelihood that had everyone all in a tizzy? About 3%. This thing never had more than a 3% chance of hitting us.\nThat\u2019s the thing of it all: asteroids that make the news are almost never worth worrying about. Not in a real way, anyway. We keep incredibly good track of the objects in space that 1) are of a dangerous size and 2) could be on a dangerous path for us, and as a result, we are overly cautious about them in a just-in-case way that can inflate a sense of fear in those who don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\nSo, here\u2019s a little bit of an explanation for how we rank the potential threat posed by these objects. Astronomers rank danger of impact on what is known as the Torino scale. It goes from 0-10, and in general, these rankings are divided into levels of concern: 0-1 are clear or green (meaning no concern), 2-4 are yellow (meaning pay attention), 5-7 are orange (meaning concern), 8-10 are red (meaning certainty of collision).\nThis ranking takes into account not only the likelihood of impact, but also the level of potential damage caused by the size of the object. The highest level of concern that has been given to an object since the scale was put in place was a 4, which went to Apophis in 2004. Apophis was actually deemed less likely to hit us than 2024 YR4, but it was bigger, so it ranked higher (it has now been demoted to 0). A yellow ranking can be achieved by anything with a collision probability above 1%.\nMost of the time, the \u201chigh\u201d impact probabilities in the 2-3% range are the result of incomplete data. That\u2019s why scientists don\u2019t worry right away when they spot these things. Almost certainly, after more observations are made, the probability will drop down to 0. And if not, we can plan for what to do next. That\u2019s why NASA\u2019s DART mission exists\u2014if we ever have to divert an object coming our way, we\u2019re moving towards being ready to do so.\nThat said, there is a category of objects that cause scientists a significant amount of concern\u2014objects coming at us from the direction of the Sun. The Sun is so bright that it blots out basically anything we could see coming our way from that direction, and we don\u2019t get the opportunity to rank its danger to us. If something big comes at us from that angle, we\u2019re at its mercy (though, experts are taking steps to hopefully mitigate that risk as well).\nBut, either fortunately or unfortunately (depending on how you look at it), we\u2019re probably not gonna have time to give almost anything coming from that direction a Torino ranking. So, if you\u2019re hearing a number, likely no need to worry yet. It\u2019s probably nothing, and if it\u2019s not, the experts are on the case.\nJackie (she/her) is a writer and editor from Pennsylvania with a background in astrophysics and a deep love of storytelling.

      "text": "Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn when you read this story:\n- Meteorites found in the Sahara Desert might be pieces of Mercury that broke off as the result of a collision when the Solar System was still forming.\n- The meteorites had many parallels to the surface of Mercury, but also some noticeable differences, including a mineral not previously detected on Mercury\u2019s surface.\n- Whether or not these rocks are from Mercury remains a mystery, but if not, they could still be useful analogs for understanding more about the innermost planet.\nThough human boots have never set foot on another planet, pieces of Mars have fallen to Earth as meteorites, giving us our only chance to study them up close until NASA\u2019s Mars Sample Return Mission drops off the rock cores collected by Perseverance. Meteorites that emerged from the Sahara desert might be from another resident of our solar system, Mercury.\nTo say Mercury is extreme is an understatement\u2014 it\u2019s hot enough to melt lead, after all. The innermost planet of the solar system is only about 58 million km. (36 million miles) from the Sun, with an average temperature of 167\u00b0C (333\u00b0F). Few spacecraft have been able to venture anywhere near this scorching clump of iron and silicates without overheating and breaking down. Mariner10 performed the first flyby of Mercury, MESSENGER orbited, and BepiColombo is on its way, but nothing has ever been able to crawl on its surface.\nIf fragments of Mars could have hurtled to Earth after some ancient collision, then why are there none from Mercury? This is the question planetary scientist Ben Rider-Stokes of The Open University in the UK wanted to answer. MESSENGER has been able to collect data about the surface composition of Mercury, but we have yet to figure out how to send something to pick up samples without being blasted by solar radiation. Stokes examined meteorites that had previously been suspected to have come from Mercury and found possible matches.\n\u201cThe rise in the number of meteorites collected from hot and cold deserts has greatly expanded the range of meteorite compositions and potential parent objects,\u201d Stokes said in a study recently published in Icarus.\nMeteorites Ksar Ghilane 022, which landed in Tunisia, and Northwest Africa 15915, discovered in Morocco, show a surface composition and mineralogy similar to the Mercurian crust. Whether they are actually from Mercury remains unknown. However, both are achondrites, previously melted meteorites characterized by an absence of chondrules (mineral spheres embedded in the rock) and made mostly of silicates such as olivine and pyroxene, often found in igneous and metamorphic rocks. Plagioclase and oldhamite are also present. They also do not fit in with any other known achondrites. There\u2019s just one issue.\nWhat is problematic about both specimens is that the iron-free silicates and oxygen isotopes they contain mirror aubrites, made largely of the translucent silicate mineral enstatite (MgSiO3). Aubrites have not been detected on the surface of Mercury.\n\u201cIt is not believed that the aubrites originated from Mercury, as the planet has an extremely red spectrum which differs from aubrite spectra, but it has been suggested that aubrites represent a proto-Mercury,\u201d said Stokes.\nBillions of years ago, Mercury might have had a different surface composition before it was pummeled by asteroids, which pockmarked it with craters. Both meteorites are about 4.5 billion years old. This makes them younger than most primitive materials that were swirling around in the solar system, but older than the smooth plains of Mercury, which cover a third of its surface and are around 3.6 billion years old. Even 4-billion-year-old regions of the plains are still no match for the age of the meteorites.\nIt is possible that the meteorites are actually remnants of Mercury\u2019s crust before there were enough collisions to obliterate that rock and expose the material beneath it. Remnants of this crust on Mercury might have gone undetected, but that knowledge eludes us. BepiColombo is expected to reach Mercury by the beginning of 2026. The spacecraft may be able to find a source of material that is a match for these mysterious rocks.\nEven if they aren\u2019t from Mercury, Ksar Ghilane 022 and Northwest Africa 15915 could be analogs for the surface of a planet on which we would\u2019t be able to take the heat.\nElizabeth Rayne is a creature who writes.

      "text": "- Earth officially has a second known Lagrange-point object.\n- This tiny asteroid orbits the sun about two months ahead of Earth.\n- Jupiter has 10,000 such objects, giving us plenty to study for precedent.\nPhysicists have discovered a tiny asteroid, about one kilometer wide, that is locked into the same orbit as Earth\u2014only the second such cosmic body of its type that has been identified to date. And now, experts wonder if that asteroid could help us with future space travel.\nKnown as \"2020 XL5,\" the asteroid will be trapped in Earth's orbit for at least 4,000 years according to simulations detailed in a new paper published earlier this month in Nature Communications. After that, it will escape from that orbit and fly off into our solar system. (It's considered a Trojan asteroid of Earth, following the naming convention for Jupiter's Trojan asteroids.)\n\ud83d\udcab You love the cosmos. So do we. Let's nerd out over it together.\nIn the meantime, 2020 XL5 is held in place due to a far-out concept in orbital mechanics, or the application of the laws of physics to describe the motion of spacecraft. It's called a \"Lagrange point,\" and it's a gravitationally balanced position in space. Earth's new Trojan asteroid orbits Lagrange point 4 (L4) in an elliptical orbit that flings it nearer to the sun than Venus and about as far away as Mars.\nToni Santana-Ros, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alicante in the coastal Valencia region of Spain, led the new research on 2020 XL5. His team first spotted the asteroid in December 2020 using the Pan-STARRS observatory, a 1.8-meter telescope located at the summit of Haleakal\u0101 in Maui, Hawaii. The team wasn't entirely sure that they'd located a new Earth Trojan asteroid, so they followed up by taking images with the Southern Astrophysical Research telescope in Chile.\nWhy was it so difficult to confirm the existence of this Trojan? It comes down to the \"unfavorable viewing geometry of an object orbiting Earth-Sun's L4 or L5 points as seen from our planet,\" the authors note in the paper. \"In short, these objects are often observable very close to the sun (i.e., at low Solar elongations) and under large phase angles (the sun-object-observer angle), meaning that a significant fraction of the object is shadowed as seen from Earth, which in turn implies the object being faint.\"\nA Brief History of Lagrange Points\nLeonhard Euler, an 18th-century math and physics luminary, first observed these points. (Euler is perhaps best known for his popularizing the use of pi, as well as for his definition of the mathematical value \"e,\" which is the basis for natural logarithms.) Euler discovered the first three known Lagrange points in the Earth-Sun system; these points of gravitational equilibrium between Earth and the sun are called L1 (Lagrange point 1), L2 (Lagrange point 2), and L3 (Lagrange point 3). All three fall along the same imaginary line that passes through both Earth and sun; two are on either side of Earth, and one is on the far opposite side of Earth's orbit around the sun.\nEuler's student\u2014Joseph-Louis Lagrange, the namesake of Lagrange points\u2014discovered the fourth and fifth such points, L4 and L5. These points fall a \"distance\" of two months away from Earth (both in front of and behind it), along its orbital path around the sun.\nThat brings us back to Lagrange points, which represent a special case of the \"three-body problem,\" an unsolved issue for astronomers who want to track the collision course of three stars hurtling toward one another through space. The reason we can solve for Lagrange points is that the third body\u2014here, 2020 XL5\u2014is tiny compared to Earth and the sun. It's like solving a system of equations by zeroing out one of the variables.\nIf massive gravity is one of the reasons that these Lagrange points are so stable, then it makes sense why Jupiter, the most massive (and nearly starlike) planet in our solar system, is absolutely loaded with objects in its Lagrange points. Between its L4 and L5 positions, there are an estimated 10,000 asteroids. Earth has just two known Trojan asteroids to date: 2020 XL5 and another called 2010 TK\u2087. But Jupiter's abundance of L4 and L5 objects may help scientists find more around Earth.\nLagrange points are mathematically cool and they represent the accumulated centuries' worth of astronomy work that has helped to create the scientific climate in which scientists discover new objects today. And Lagrange points have practical uses, too. That's because they form naturally stable little pockets where human-made objects, like satellites, can safely stay in place without using very much energy. The James Webb Space Telescope, for instance, is parked in orbit around Lagrange point 2 (L2), a gravitationally semi-stable location in space aligned with Earth and the sun.\nBut could we use Lagrange points in other ways? Santana-Ros notes that 2020 XL\u2085 has an orbit that bobs above and below Earth's orbital plane. This means that to maneuver a spacecraft into a rendezvous (to orbit or land on it) would require a considerable velocity change; that would probably require too much fuel to be practical. The same applies to 2010 TK\u2087.\nHowever, the new study points out that if other Earth Trojans are found in orbits that are less tilted, these might make handy bases as staging posts for exploration of the Solar System. They'd be much easier to take off from than from Earth or the moon because their gravity is so slight. They could even hold a wealth of resources that we could mine.\nPerhaps most interestingly, objects like the 2020 XL\u2085 Trojan asteroid could help humans edge further and further into outer space. We can easily predict where these objects will be, and we can land on and take off from them with almost no interference from gravity. This could mean turning flights to Mars into ones with a brief layover, helping to close the technological gap between the enormous power needed to leave Earth's gravity and the much steadier \"pulse engine\" type power needed to travel to Mars.\nCaroline Delbert is a writer, avid reader, and contributing editor at Pop Mech.

      "text": "- Two exciting new studies detail the life-supporting contents of a 4.3-ounce sample of the asteroid Bennu.\n- The OSIRIS-REx mission returned to the sample to Earth in September of 2023, and these studies show that it contains amino acids, nucleobases, and minerals known as evaporites\u2014all elements of life\u2019s building blocks.\n- While not a detection of life itself, this study shows that the Solar System may have been far more conducive to life in its distant past then we previously believed.\nSome 4.5 billion years ago, a monster asteroid around 60 miles wide formed in the outer reaches of the Solar System\u2014beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Around one to two billion years ago, this mega-asteroid broke apart in the Asteroid Belt, producing a chunk of rock that us ape-like inhabitants on the Solar System\u2019s third planet would one day call \u201cBennu.\u201d\nEventually, those intelligent mammals would send a spacecraft called OSIRIS-REx to retrieve a sample of this rock in an attempt to better understand the early universe and the chances of life hiding elsewhere in the Solar System (and beyond). On September 24, 2023, a 4.3-ounce Bennu sample\u2014perfectly preserved within OSIRIS-REx\u2019s nitrogen-filled glovebox\u2014crash-landed in the Utah desert.\nNow, twin studies published in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy are writing the next chapter of Bennu\u2019s incredible 4.5 billion-year-old-story\u2014and this one\u2019s a real doozy. After close examination of the unspoiled sample, NASA and other scientists from around the world have confirm it a treasure trove of life\u2019s building blocks. In a press statement, NASA is quick to clarify that they haven\u2019t found life, but that this collection of amino acids, nucleobases, and minerals known as \u201cevaporites\u201d suggests that the conditions for life to take hold were widespread across the early Solar System.\n\u201cNASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx mission already is rewriting the textbook on what we understand about the beginnings of our solar system,\u201d Nicky Fox, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters, said in a press statement. \u201cAsteroids provide a time capsule into our home planet\u2019s history, and Bennu\u2019s samples are pivotal in our understanding of what ingredients in our solar system existed before life started on Earth.\u201d\nThis discovery wasn\u2019t completely unexpected. Scientists discovered evidence of water on Bennu back in 2018, and soon after retrieval of the sample, NASA confirmed Bennu was rich in carbon. But now we know just how rich it really was. The Nature Astronomy paper reports that the sample contains 14 of the 20 amino acids (which make proteins) found on Earth, all five nucleobases life uses for storing and transmitting genetic instructions, and high levels of ammonia\u2014which can aid in the formation of amino acids.\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, another team\u2014led by meteorite experts and cosmic mineralogists at Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History and the Natural History Museum in London\u2014found 11 minerals that only form when water containing dissolved salts evaporates (aka \u201cevaporites\u201d).\n\u201cWe also learned that these minerals, formed when water evaporates, disappear when exposed to water once again\u2014even with the tiny amount of water found in air,\u201d the authors co-wrote in a post on The Conversation. \u201cThat explains why we can\u2019t find these minerals in meteorites that have been on Earth for decades to centuries.\u201d\nAs with any major discovery, Bennu also inspires more questions. For example, life on Earth only produces what are referred to as left-handed amino acids, but the asteroid contains an equal amount of left and right amino acids. It\u2019s still a mystery why life adopted this left-handedness, and one scientists eventually hope to solve as they gather more information.\n\u201cOSIRIS-REx has been a highly successful mission,\u201d NASA\u2019s Jason Dworkin, co-lead author on the Nature Astronomy paper, said in a press statement. \u201cWhy we, so far, only see life on Earth and not elsewhere, that\u2019s the truly tantalizing question.\u201d\nDarren lives in Portland, has a cat, and writes/edits about sci-fi and how our world works.

      "text": "- Researchers say they've confirmed the first and only known death by falling meteorite\u2014in 1888.\n- Meteor showers happen all the time, but very few meteorites strike Earth and even fewer are verified.\n- The records of this meteorite strike were written in a difficult, arcane form of the Turkish language.\nDetermined researchers have found what they say is the first confirmed evidence from the historical record of a human being killed by a falling meteorite. The documentation had been hiding in plain sight in an ornate, elite form of Turkish that\u2019s hard to translate. The researchers say this represents a step forward in the study and translation of the historic record in order to corroborate with the scientific record.\n\u201cWell-documented stories of meteorite-caused injury or death are rare,\u201d NASA explains. \u201cIn the first known case of an extraterrestrial object to have injured a human being in the U.S., Ann Hodges of Sylacauga, Alabama, was severely bruised by a 8-pound (3.6-kilogram) stony meteorite that crashed through her roof in November 1954.\u201d\nThat tidbit will change if NASA validates the claims of corresponding author Ozan \u00dcnsalan and his colleagues. \u00dcnsalan is an eclectic physicist, and his two coauthors are a Turkish academic historian and a meteor astronomer from SETI\u2019s Carl Sagan Center. SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, operates the Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) network.\nMonitoring meteorites has always been part of SETI\u2019s mission. By combining historical information about meteorites and translation skills, these researchers say they\u2019ve verified a reported death by meteorite that happened in 1888. Ideally, they\u2019d also have a physical rock that can be studied to show it is from outer space.\nBut they don\u2019t have that rock, which represents a potentially big sticking point. They do, however, have three independent accounts of the events from local governments, and witnesses saw the meteor shower while it rained fiery rocks on one village for up to 10 minutes. One man was killed, according to the reports, and another was struck and paralyzed.\nScience Alert cites a decades-old paper about the difficulty of verifying deaths from meteorites, which comes in multiple forms. First is \u201cthe lack of material evidence that the missiles involved in the accidents were genuinely meteoric,\u201d the paper explains. Today, that would be pretty straightforward with the help of laser spectrometry or an electron microscope, which would quickly rule out, yes, \u201cmeteor-wrongs.\u201d (It\u2019s in the Name Hall of Fame next to \u201cincidentaloma.\u201d)\nBut three matching reports from different officials is pretty compelling. Why did it take so long for these accounts to come to light? Well, they\u2019re written in the official language of the Ottoman Empire at the time, Ottoman Turkish, which uses a complex alphabet based on Persian Arabic. Back then, common people usually spoke traditional Turkish, creating a duality between that and formal Ottoman Turkish.\nThis isn\u2019t unique\u2014languages like Latin had formal and informal versions, and Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese Chinese share a written version, but are spoken differently. As Ottoman Turkish researcher Eleazar Birnbaum wrote in a 1967 paper, the language is unique for how long it took scholars to transliterate the outmoded alphabet. Turkey switched to the Roman alphabet in the 1920s. \u201cIt was the literary vehicle of one of the world\u2019s greatest empires, an empire which was literate in the three greatest literary languages of the Islamic World,\u201d Birnbaum explained.\nToday, there's an official Library of Congress romanization plan for Ottoman Turkish. But these things still take time and rely on research interest. \u00dcnsalan and colleagues worked using a grant from the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey. With their financial help, Turkey now has the distinction of the first known meteorite death\u2014in history or today.\nCaroline Delbert is a writer, avid reader, and contributing editor at Pop Mech.

      "text": "- Today\u2019s moons, planets, and dwarf planets formed from a proto-planetery disk surrounding our Sun 4.6 billion years ago.\n- However, not all of those celestial bodies survived, and a new analysis of a the meteorite NWA 15915 shows that it likely originated from a world that was similar to Mercury in its composition\u2014but not Mercury itself.\n- These rare meteorites, which make up only 0.2 percent of meteorites broadly, provide an incredibly rare window into the chaotic machinations of the early Solar System.\nToday, the Solar System appears as a neatly organized set-up of eight (possibly nine?) planets orbiting the Sun. But flash back more than four billion years ago\u2014as planets formed from our star\u2019s proto-planetary disk\u2014and things were much more chaotic. Our own planet, for example, had a devastating rendezvous with its sister protoplanet, and remnants of that interaction can still be found deep in the Earth\u2019s lower mantle.\nMeteorites littered across the planet can also contain details of this tumultuous period of the early Solar System, and a new analysis of one such meteorite\u2014known as Northwest Africa (NWA) 15915\u2014shows that this 2.84-kilogram (6.26 pound) rock could be a piece of a long-dead planet that likely formed in a Mercury-like environment. This new analysis (led by Jennifer Mitchell at the University of Minnesota) looked at the coarse-grained achondrite that was originally discovered in Algeria in 2023, and found that the rock didn\u2019t fit within other meteorite groups or planetary bodies.\nThis is particularly puzzling, as a vast majority of meteorites can be traced to some well-known parent body\u2014whether that be the Moon, Mars, or other asteroids. In fact, according to New Scientist, only 0.2 percent of meteorites are outliers. And NWA 15915 fits this atypical description.\nTo better understand the origins of this meteorite, Mitchell and her team used an electron microscope and spectroscopic instruments to study its composition. They found that it was different from Mercury\u2019s makeup, but that it formed in a similarly low-oxygen environment (like Mercury did). Mitchell reported the results at the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference in Texas last week, and also submitted a meeting brief with preliminary findings.\n\u201cOur initial analysis of NWA 15915 indicates an interesting magmatic and post-crystallization history,\u201d the meeting brief reads. \u201cThe magnetic properties of NWA 15915 show evidence of Fe-metal, daubr\u00e9elite, and troilite. At present, our work supports the view of a large differentiated body in the inner Solar System.\u201d\nAs New Scientist explains, this meteorite has a strange mix of magnetic metal-rich minerals, and because these crystals were relatively large, they cooled slowly. Both of these attributes suggest a Mercury-like origin.\nAlthough finding rocks from long-dead worlds is a rarity, it isn\u2019t an impossibility. In some models, the early Solar System contained at least 50 to 100 Moon-to-Mars-sized protoplanets. While many of these coalesced into the planets we know today (like Theia\u2019s violent combination with Earth roughly four billion years ago), others (such as the dwarf planets Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta) survived mostly intact. So, while several of these worlds may have been destroyed billions of years ago, pieces of them still survive\u2014on Earth, on other planets, or spread throughout the Main Asteroid and Kuiper belts.\nMitchell reiterates that this is only a preliminary finding, but it provides an incredible opportunity to learn more about the forgotten worlds of our early Solar System.\nDarren lives in Portland, has a cat, and writes/edits about sci-fi and how our world works.

      "text": "- The Winchcombe meteorite is a rare find, with a similar hydrogen isotope ratio to the water on Earth.\n- Recovering a meteorite within 12 hours of arrival means it is as pristine a specimen as we can get without going to space.\n- Eleven percent of the meteorite\u2019s weight comes from Earth-like water, intriguing scientists about the implications of Earth\u2019s early composition.\nScooping up a meteorite within 12 hours of crashing turned out to be a scientific boon for researchers investigating the hydrogen makeup of this visitor from outer space. The one pound of carbonaceous chondrite plowed into the English town of Winchcombe in February 2021. Its most spectacular feature, according to the scientists? The rock\u2019s hydrogen isotope ratio is strikingly similar to that of water on Earth.\n\ud83e\ude90 You love the mysteries of the solar system. So do we. Let\u2019s learn more about it together\u2014join Pop Mech Pro.\n\u201cOne of the biggest questions asked of the scientific community is how did we get here? This analysis on the Winchcombe meteorite gives insight into how the Earth came to have water, the source of so much life,\u201d Luke Daly, University of Glasgow lecturer and and an author of the first paper on the meteorite published at Science Advances, says in a news release. \u201cResearchers will continue to work on this specimen for years to come, unlocking more secrets into the origins of our solar system.\u201d\nKey to the research was the fact specialists from across the world could start investigating the Winchcombe meteorite within days of its fiery fall from the sky. Less than 12 hours after its entry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, pieces of the rock were plucked from a driveway and the surrounding area and taken to London\u2019s Natural History Museum, away from any environmental effects that could change its analysis.\n\u201cThe rapid retrieval and curation of Winchcombe make it one of the most pristine meteorites available for analysis, offering scientists a tantalizing glimpse back through time to the original composition of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago,\u201d Ashley Key, Natural History Museum senior curator and the paper\u2019s co-author, says in a news release. Estimates vary, but Earth is about 4.5 billion years old.\nThe meteorite offers a look at a rare carbonaceous chondrite, a high silicate rock containing approximately 2 percent carbon by weight. It is the first of its type to be discovered in the United Kingdom. After imaging and chemical analysis, researchers determined it contains 11 percent extraterrestrial water by weight. Most of the water is trapped in minerals created by chemical reactions between fluids and rocks on the asteroid the meteorite originated from\u2014during what scientists believe to be the earliest formation of our solar system.\nBy measuring the ratio of hydrogen isotopes in the water, the team found it closely resembles the composition of water on Earth. It also contains extraterrestrial amino acids, or prebiotic molecules that are key for the creation of life. Because the meteorite was largely unmodified by Earth\u2019s environment due to its quick retrieval, the researchers believe their findings bolster the theory that carbonaceous asteroids played a key role in bringing the ingredients of life\u2014like water\u2014to early Earth. This makes the Winchcombe meteorite notably different from the more common icy comets, which don\u2019t have chemistry matching Earth\u2019s water.\n\u201cDirect links between carbonaceous chondrites and their parent bodies in the solar system are rare,\u201d according to the paper. \u201cThe Winchcombe meteorite is the most accurately recorded carbonaceous chondrite fall. Its pre-atmospheric orbit and cosmic-ray exposure age confirm that it arrived on Earth shortly after ejection from a primitive asteroid.\u201d\nBy combining camera footage of its trajectory from the U.K. Fireball Alliance\u2014which aims to recover fallen meteorites as soon as possible\u2014with chemical analysis of the meteorite, researchers believe Winchcombe broke off the surface of an asteroid near Jupiter and traveled to Earth within the last million years.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still reeling from our good fortune to have such an important meteorite fall in the U.K.,\u201d Natasha Almeida, curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum and paper co-author, says in a news release. \u201cThe combination of such a quick recovery, careful collection, and our ongoing curation of Winchcombe in a nitrogen atmosphere means this incredibly fresh specimen will remain one of the most pristine meteorites in collections worldwide.\u201d\nTim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.
