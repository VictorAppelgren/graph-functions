      "summary": "Eco Wave Power’s pilot in Los Angeles uses floating paddles to convert wave motion into electricity, aiming to power 60,000 homes if scaled across the 13‑km breakwater. The system, designed to withstand high waves and allow on‑shore maintenance, could supply up to 130 million homes’ worth of power along the West Coast. While wave energy remains underdeveloped, the project has attracted support from California regulators and investors like AltaSea, who see it as a key component of the state’s 2045 carbon‑neutral goal. The company plans to expand to other U.S. sites and international locations such as Portugal, Taiwan, and India by 2026.",
