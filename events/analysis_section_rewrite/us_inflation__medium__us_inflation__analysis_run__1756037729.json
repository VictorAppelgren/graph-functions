      "feedback": "The draft shows a solid cross‑asset intuition but lacks a disciplined 3–6 month scenario map, explicit triggers/invalidations, and quantified linkages to the cited sources. It overreads a few private‑markets anecdotes (Pacaso, Mogul, HeartSciences) without forcing time‑bound catalysts or clear gating events, and it underexplores critical data points (HeartSciences’ Medicare/FDA milestones; UAS job‑growth dynamics; the 1.8T vacation‑home market; private‑market liquidity channels). To lift to world‑class, rewrite as a tight 3–6 month scenario map with: 1) base case plus 1–2 clearly defined alt paths, each with explicit timing windows (0–2 weeks, 1–2 months, 3–6 months) and path‑dependency rules; 2) a complete triggers/invalidations table anchored to numerics: inflation prints and wage data (BoJ/Ueda suggests persistent wage growth; US inflation trajectory), AI productivity milestones (Range’s 1–1.5% productivity lift assumption; Range’s 78M net new jobs/6–12% private‑market scaling potential can frame upside), HeartSciences milestones (FDA/Medicare reimbursement starting 2025; 32B ECG market by 2034), Pacaso/mogul funding/IPO or expansion milestones (Pacaso’s 10 new destinations; 1.8T vacation‑home market; mogul’s 10–12% cash‑on‑cash; 18.8% IRR), and UAS data (Grand Forks evidence of 97% rise in UAS jobs with $105k+ average salary); 3) precise invalidation points (e.g., Nasdaq listing approvals delaying Pacaso/Mogul; HeartSciences FDA/implementation delays; AI adoption falling short of 0.5–1.5% productivity gains; a sustained inflation surprise keeping yields elevated); 4) quantify impact channels rather than qualitative statements—link each catalyst to asset‑class implications (equities/credit/private equity flows, private real assets) and assign directional bets; 5) reconcile conflicts and coverage gaps (note AUVSI‑defunct 2014 UAS projections vs. 97% rise in UAS jobs per 2025 EDC data; explicitly cite FOM34PUWA data); 6) tighten the chronology and add a concise watchlist with concrete data triggers (US CPI/WPI, wage indicators, BoJ wage trends, HeartSciences FDA/Medicare events, Pacaso/Mogul financing/IPO cadence, UAS hiring data) so readers can audit the logic. Actionable edits: rewrite into a single 3–6 month scenario paragraph with a base case (AI productivity uplift, disinflation bias, modest debt drift), alt 1 (inflation/sticky wages, higher yields), alt 2 (tech/regulatory delays and slower private‑market fundraising); insert explicit windows and gating conditions; replace generic claims with numbers from sources (UPV3X2MQ6 for Pacaso/Mogul/Range/HeartSciences; FOM34PUWA for UAS; ILYC1M41F as supporting FIRE/portfolio theses); increase citation density by tying each claim to the exact ID; and end with a concise, testable watch‑list and confidence band. Citations to lock in: A7VLN74BK, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, FOM34PUWA, and, where relevant, HeartSciences data from UPV3X2MQ6.",
