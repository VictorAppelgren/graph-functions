      "feedback": "The analysis draft presents a coherent overview of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it could benefit from enhanced specificity and depth. To elevate the analysis to world-class quality, consider the following actionable edits: \n\n1. **Depth and Clarity of Reasoning**: Strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking how inflation dynamics influence consumer behavior and Fed policy decisions. Incorporate specific examples of how tariffs have historically impacted inflation and employment.\n\n2. **First-Principles Grounding**: Clearly define the first principles mentioned (e.g., balance of payments, inflation-targeting) and explain their relevance to the current economic context. This will provide a stronger theoretical foundation for your arguments.\n\n3. **Scenario Structure**: Articulate potential scenarios based on different inflation outcomes and Fed responses. For instance, what happens if inflation remains above target versus if it falls back to the target? \n\n4. **Specificity of Catalysts**: Identify and quantify specific economic indicators to watch, such as expected changes in the Producer Price Index or consumer spending metrics, and explain their potential impact on market dynamics.\n\n5. **Quantification and Use of Numbers**: Integrate more precise data points and forecasts, such as expected inflation rates or employment growth figures, to support your claims and avoid generalizations.\n\n6. **Citation Density and Correctness**: Ensure that all claims are backed by specific citations from the source material, and reconcile any conflicting data points to present a unified narrative.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the analysis will not only enhance its analytical rigor but also provide readers with actionable insights grounded in robust economic theory and data.",
