  "title": "Bullish Raises $1.1 Billion in IPO Priced Over Range",
  "description": "Bullish raised $1.1 billion in an initial public offering, pricing its shares above the marketed range. Bailey Lipschultz has more on \"Bloomberg Open Interest.\" (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Let's stay on the topic of crypto equity IPOs because bullish projected to go public today, I believe it's first trade. This is interesting because in 2021 it had plans to go public via a SPAC with a much higher valuation, about $9 billion. That's not the case in 2025. No pricing. Valuation right around, I believe, $5.4 billion based on outstanding shares. If you do see that performance in the aftermarket that we saw with the circular that we've seen with Sigma ARCore, we could see that number jump pretty tremendously. This is an interesting deal. They ended up raising about $1.1 billion. We saw it go out on the cover last week with a lower range, lower valuation and really walking up to this pricing. So when I talk to by siders who have been kind of circling this company, there's so much pent up demand for crypto. We my colleague Anthony Hughes broke yesterday that there was more than 20 times demand for those shares before this pricing. So there's a lot of excitement. It's going to be another example of a deal that has BlackRock has ARC and will be an interesting open and when it does open later today.",
