  "title": "Why the Nexstar-Tegna merger matters in Cleveland",
  "description": "If approved, the deal would put WJW Fox 8 and WKYC Channel 3 under the same ownership, potentially reshaping the local TV landscape",
  "content": "WKYC Channel 3 parent company Tegna has approved a deal to merge with Nexstar, which owns crosstown rival WJW Fox 8. (File photo: Eustacio Humphrey/The Plain Dealer) The Plain Dealer\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Nexstar Media Group\u2019s plan to buy Tegna in a $6.2 billion deal could shake up local television as we know it. If approved, the merger would put Cleveland\u2019s WJW Fox 8 and WKYC Channel 3 under the same corporate roof.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nWhy do Nexstar and Tegna want to merge?\n\nBy adding Tegna\u2019s 64 stations to its portfolio of more than 200, Nexstar would cement its status as the nation\u2019s largest local broadcasting company, helping it better compete with tech giants and legacy media companies for advertising dollars. Both companies frame the deal as a way to \u201cstrengthen\u201d their properties and ensure \u201clong-term vitality.\u201d The combined entity could also command higher transmission fees from cable and streaming providers.\n\nNexstar already owns WJW Fox 8, historically the market\u2019s top-rated news station. Tegna owns WKYC, Cleveland\u2019s NBC affiliate. The two have been crosstown rivals since the late 1940s. The deal would bring both under Nexstar\u2019s control.\n\nThe merger is illegal under current regulations \u2014 for now\n\nFCC rules prohibit one company from owning two of the top four stations in the same market, but there have been exceptions. In Indianapolis, for example, Nexstar is allowed to own the CBS and FOX affiliates because of nuances of the market, which boasts a plethora of independent stations.\n\nThat precedent likely wouldn\u2019t apply in Cleveland under current regulations. Still, in July, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated the FCC\u2019s \u201cTop-Four Prohibition\u201d calling the agency\u2019s rationale \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The court gave the FCC 90 days to justify the rule or let it expire. Momentum appears to favor the latter. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, applauded the court\u2019s decision, saying the regulation \u201cdoes not match marketplace realities.\u201d\n\nThe FCC also caps how many households a single broadcaster can reach, which is currently 39% of U.S. households. A merged Nexstar-Tegna would cover roughly 80% \u2014 more than double the current limit. However, Nexstar CEO Perry Sook has expressed confidence that the FCC may revise or eliminate the cap amid broader deregulatory efforts.\n\n\u201cThe initiatives being pursued by the Trump administration offer local broadcasters the opportunity to expand reach, level the playing field and compete more effectively,\u201d Sook said in a statement.\n\nHow could this affect local news?\n\nFree press advocates warn the merger could mean fewer independent voices and leaner newsrooms. Nexstar\u2019s press release reaffirmed its commitment to \u201cfact-based journalism,\u201d but it also touted \u201csynergy realization,\u201d corporate shorthand for cost-cutting and eliminating redundancies. In other markets where one company controls multiple top stations, operations have been consolidated or co-located, even if each outlet keeps its own brand.\n\nCould that someday mean Russ Mitchell and Tracy McCool anchoring the evening news together on WKYC and WJW? The reality is it\u2019s way too early to predict what a combined newsroom might look like. This much is certain \u2014 pending FCC action and shareholder approval \u2014 change is coming.\n\nIs another suitor in play?\n\nSinclair Broadcast Group \u2014 which doesn\u2019t own a station in Cleveland \u2014 has also expressed interest in Tegna, though the board has already approved Nexstar\u2019s offer. Sinclair could conceivably make a higher offer that might sway shareholders.\n\nWhen could this happen?\n\nIf regulators and shareholders sign off, the merger is expected to close in the second half of 2026.",

      "text": "U.S. Appeals Court Vacates FCC\u2019s Top-Four Station Ownership Rule\nNAB, FCC chair Brendan Carr applaud 8th Circuit\u2019s ruling overturning FCC rules that station groups can\u2019t own more than one of the four most-watched TV stations in a market\nWASHINGTON\u2014In an important development in the battle over broadcast ownership regulations, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has vacated the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s rules against a station group owning more than one of the top-four TV stations in audience share in a given market.\nThe St. Louis-based court also vacated an amendment to \u201cNote 11\u201d in the FCC rules that tightened how the top four stations are determined, but declined to undo rules governing radio stations and denied the petition for review of all other issues.\nUnder the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC is required to review its broadcast ownership rules every four years and repeal or modify any that are no longer in the public interest. Following a December 2023 FCC order retaining existing regulations as part of its 2018 quadrennial review, the National Association of Broadcasters and a coalition of local broadcasters challenged the order, arguing that the FCC\u2019s approach ignored the competitive pressures broadcasters face from digital platforms and failed to meet the statutory requirements for review.\nThe 8th Circuit ruling found that the FCC\u2019s rationale for retaining the rules was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d \u201cunsupported by the record\u201d and relied on \u201coutdated\u201d or insufficient evidence. The court wrote that \u201cin light of the evidence against the Top-Four Prohibition and in the absence of any record-supported reason for keeping the rule,\u201d the Commission failed to justify its continued enforcement of that regulation.\nThe ruling comes at a time when broadcasters have been hopeful that the FCC might significantly revise or eliminate the ownership rules. FCC Chair Brendan Carr has vowed to eliminate rules that make it harder for broadcasters to fund local news and the agency has opened a docket calling for public comment on the rules.\nIn response to the ruling, Carr and the NAB applauded the decision.\n\u201cNAB is extremely pleased with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision to vacate the previous FCC\u2019s arbitrary and outdated top-four prohibition,\u201d NAB president and CEO Curtis LeGeyt said. \u201cThis is a major step forward for local television broadcasters seeking to compete and thrive in a vastly transformed media marketplace.\nThe professional video industry's #1 source for news, trends and product and tech information. Sign up below.\n\u201cAt the same time, we are disappointed that the court stopped short of addressing the decades-old radio ownership restrictions that defy economic reality and weaken broadcasters\u2019 ability to compete, invest in local journalism and serve their communities,\u201d he added. \u201cFortunately, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has long been a champion for empowering local stations, and we look forward to working with this FCC to modernize its local radio ownership rules and ensure local broadcasters can thrive in the communities they serve across the nation.\u201d\nWhen Carr was a commissioner, he opposed the 2023 FCC Order.\nIn response to the 8th Circuit ruling, Carr said: \u201cFor decades, the FCC\u2019s approach to regulating the broadcast industry has failed to promote the public interest. That has only made it harder for trusted and local sources of news and information to compete in today\u2019s media environment. And that is why I dissented from the Biden-era FCC\u2019s decision to retain a regulation that does not match marketplace realities. I am pleased to see that the court agrees and has vacated that regulation.\u201d\nThe FCC has approved some recent transactions allowing broadcasters to own more than one top-four station. In July, Gray and Scripps also have entered into station swaps that would require a waiver of the rule.\nThe full ruling is available here.\nGeorge Winslow is the senior content producer for TV Tech. He has written about the television, media and technology industries for nearly 30 years for such publications as Broadcasting & Cable, Multichannel News and TV Tech. Over the years, he has edited a number of magazines, including Multichannel News International and World Screen, and moderated panels at such major industry events as NAB and MIP TV. He has published two books and dozens of encyclopedia articles on such subjects as the media, New York City history and economics."

      "text": "Nexstar Media Group, Inc. Enters into Definitive Agreement To Acquire TEGNA Inc. for $6.2 Billion in Accretive Transaction\nEnhances Nexstar\u2019s Position as a Leading Local Media Company\nPreserves High-Quality Local Journalism and Diversity of Opinion\nStrengthens Ability to Compete with Big Tech and Big Media\nExpected to Drive Increased Profitability and Returns for Nexstar Shareholders\nIRVING, Texas and TYSONS, Virginia (Aug. 19, 2025) \u2013 Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: NXST) (\u201cNexstar\u201d) and TEGNA Inc. (NYSE: TEGNA) (\u201cTEGNA\u201d) announced today that they entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) whereby, subject to regulatory approvals, Nexstar will acquire all outstanding shares of TEGNA for $22.00 per share in a cash transaction valued at $6.2 billion, inclusive of TEGNA\u2019s net debt and estimated transaction fees and expenses. The purchase price represents a 31% premium to TEGNA\u2019s average 30-day average stock price ending August 8, 2025, the last closing stock price prior to media reports of a potential transaction. Following completion of the transaction, the combined entity will be a leading local media company, well-positioned to compete in today\u2019s fragmented and rapidly evolving marketplace. The new company will be better able to serve communities by ensuring the long-term vitality of local news and programming from trusted local sources and preserving the diversity of local voice and opinion. Nexstar will also be able to provide advertisers with an even greater variety of competitive local and national broadcast and digital advertising solutions to serve brands and consumers more effectively.\nNexstar\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Perry A. Sook, commented, \u201cThe initiatives being pursued by the Trump administration offer local broadcasters the opportunity to expand reach, level the playing field, and compete more effectively with the Big Tech and legacy Big Media companies that have unchecked reach and vast financial resources. We believe TEGNA represents the best option for Nexstar to act on this opportunity. TEGNA is a premier operator with high quality local television stations primarily in the top 75 DMAs. We and TEGNA are similarly dedicated to providing communities of all sizes with the best programming and fact-based local journalism along with innovative digital products and marketing solutions for local viewers and advertisers. The transaction will increase Nexstar\u2019s reach through the expansion of our presence in important DMAs such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Seattle, and Minneapolis, as well as enhance our local presence, enabling us to continue to provide the core local news and programming that is in the public\u2019s interest.\u201d\nMr. Sook continued, \u201cNexstar has a stellar long-term record of growth through its deals, having completed many well-received transactions since 2011, including the 2019 acquisition of Tribune Media. The playbook we followed to make those transactions successful \u2013 improving and increasing local content, executing on identified synergies, and quickly de-leveraging our balance sheet with free cash flow post close \u2013 are the same opportunities and strategies we will use in connection with this transaction. With committed financing and a plan for significant synergy realization, we believe the combined entity will be poised for growth, leverage reduction, and the enhancement of shareholder value.\u201d\nHoward Elias, Chairman of TEGNA\u2019s Board of Directors commented, \u201cAt TEGNA, we share Nexstar\u2019s commitment to local broadcasting, exemplified by numerous investments and initiatives, industry journalism awards, and the significant expansion of our local news content. This transaction, which will provide premium near-term value to TEGNA shareholders, comes at a time of rapid change in our industry and reflects the fact that policymakers of all perspectives are calling for regulations governing our industry to be modernized. This transaction with Nexstar will further solidify the critical role our stations serve in our communities, preserve their trust, and be better able to compete in today\u2019s highly fragmented media environment.\u201d\nMike Steib, Chief Executive Officer of TEGNA, said, \u201cWe are thrilled to have found a partner in Nexstar that will enable TEGNA\u2019s stations to continue doing what we do best: creating outstanding and impactful local content coupled with the delivery of indispensable digital products to the communities we serve around the country. Nexstar and TEGNA both share a rich heritage of commitment to journalistic excellence and technological advancements. Together, we will expand news coverage to serve more communities, across more screens, and ultimately secure the future of local news for generations to come.\u201d\nTransaction Details\n- TEGNA purchase price of $22.00 per share, reflects a 31% premium to TEGNA\u2019s unaffected 30-day average stock price ending August 8, 2025.\n- Transaction has been unanimously approved by TEGNA\u2019s Board of Directors.\n- TEGNA debt will be refinanced and/or assumed at close.\n- Committed financing in place from BofA Securities, J.P. Morgan Chase N.A., and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to finance the transaction.\nTransaction Highlights\n- Combines two best-in-class television broadcast companies which share an unwavering commitment to localism, innovation, and superior, trustworthy programming.\n- Increases operational and geographic diversity and scale. Upon closing, Nexstar, together with its partners, will have 265 full-power television stations in 44 states and the District of Columbia and 132 of the country\u2019s 210 television DMAs. The combined company will have stations in 9 of the top 10 DMAs, 41 of the top 50 DMAs, 62 of the top 75 DMAs and 82 of the top 100 DMAs, covering, in total, 80% of U.S. television households.\n- Enhances presence in local DMAs. Nexstar\u2019s station footprint overlaps with TEGNA in 35 of TEGNA\u2019s 51 DMAs, providing improved synergy potential in these markets.\n- Extends footprint to additional contested election DMAs. The addition of strong Big-4 affiliates in key contested election DMAs, such as Phoenix, AZ, Atlanta, GA, Toledo, OH, and Portland, ME, will enhance the political advertising outlook for Nexstar in even-numbered years.\nFinancial Summary and Outlook\n- On a combined basis for the last eight quarters annualized ending June 30, 2025, Nexstar, together with TEGNA, would have combined net revenue (excluding synergies) of $8.10 billion and combined Adjusted EBITDA (excluding synergies) before stock-based compensation of $2.56 billion.\n- Based on our estimates for 2025, Nexstar expects to generate annual net synergies of approximately $300 million from a combination of revenue synergies and net operating expense reductions.\n- Together, the Adjusted Free Cash Flow of TEGNA, the expected synergies on an after-tax basis and the estimated after-tax financing costs related to the transaction, is expected to be more than 40% accretive to Nexstar\u2019s standalone Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the first twelve months after closing.\n- After giving effect to the transaction, the incurrence of transaction-related debt, transaction expenses, and expected synergies, Nexstar expects its net leverage ratio to be approximately 4x at closing with de-leveraging to current leverage levels in 2028. As of June 30, 2025, Nexstar\u2019s total net leverage ratio was 3.19x.\n- Consistent with past transactions, Nexstar initially intends to allocate excess free cash flow to repay debt.\nTiming and Approvals\n- The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including TEGNA shareholder and regulatory approvals.\n- The transaction is expected to close by the second half of 2026.\nAdvisors\nBofA Securities, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are acting as financial advisors and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Wiley Rein LLP, and Morrison Foerster are acting as legal counsel to Nexstar.\nAllen & Company LLC is acting as financial advisor to TEGNA and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, and Covington & Burling LLP are acting as its legal counsel.\nConference Call, Webcast, Investor Presentation\nNexstar will host a conference call today, August 19, at 10:00 a.m. ET to review the transaction and host a question-and-answer session.

  "argos_summary": "Nexstar Media Group has agreed to buy Tegna for $6.2\u202fbillion, a deal that would bring Cleveland\u2019s WJW Fox\u202f8 and WKYC Channel\u202f3 under one owner and make Nexstar the largest local TV broadcaster. The merger faces regulatory hurdles, notably the FCC\u2019s top\u2011four ownership rule, but a recent court ruling vacating that rule may ease approval. The consolidation could boost Nexstar\u2019s reach to about 80\u202f% of U.S. households and generate synergies, though critics warn it could reduce newsroom independence and cut costs. If approved, the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026.",
