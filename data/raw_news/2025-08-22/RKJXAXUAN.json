  "title": "Elias: Bonta may soon become front-runner for California governor",
  "description": "The state\u2019s attorney general stands out as the likely strongest candidate in a wide but weak field.",
  "content": "For many months, California Attorney General Rob Bonta laid low in the 2026 run for California governor.\n\nHe did this by insisting he would run for re-election if Kamala Harris opted to make the run for governor, which was the general expectation for her until July 30, when she stunned the political world by opting out of the campaign. Bonta has no need for to lay low any longer, unless he sincerely doesn\u2019t want the job. In a wide but weak field, Bonta stands out as likely the strongest candidate.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris would be a great governor,\u201d Bonta said of a prospective Harris run early on. \u2026 \u201cI would support her if she ran, I\u2019ve always supported her in everything she\u2019s done. She would be field\u2011clearing.\u201d\n\nInstead, Harris has now cleared the field for what proves to be the most openly competitive run for California governor in generations. It\u2019s hard to remember a more open race in the modern era, when there always seems to have been an obvious successor waiting in the wings whenever a gubernatorial campaign came up.\n\nThere is no such successor this time, though, no Gavin Newsom waiting for Jerry Brown to get out of the way, no Brown waiting for Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s departure and no Schwarzenegger waiting to oust Gray Davis in a recall election, to name just a few recent runs for governor.\n\nRemembering the achievements of the current crop of gubernatorial candidates is hard. The first newly named frontrunner, Orange County\u2019s former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, was a tough questioner in Congress, but try to name a singular achievement.\n\nReal estate developer Rick Caruso, who lost a 2022 run for mayor of Los Angeles, seems more focused on criticizing the current mayor than running for governor. The top achievement of former state Senate President Toni Atkins, of San Diego, seems to have been becoming the first lesbian occupant of that office.\n\nThere\u2019s also former state controller Betty Yee, who lacks a singular achievement too. Then there\u2019s former Los Angeles Mayor and state Assembly speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, whose achievements seem lost in the winds of time, because he\u2019s been out of office raking in private payments for services so long.\n\nNot to be forgotten is Xavier Becerra, once the elected attorney general of California and later a Joe Biden cabinet officer. He was President Trump\u2019s prime legal antagonist during Trump\u2019s first term, filing more than 100 lawsuits and greatly impeding the Trump agenda.\n\nAlso there was Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, who has the usual nonmemorable achievements of any recent lieutenant governor. Kounalakis, however, announced Aug. 8 that she was dropping out of the governor\u2019s race to run instead for state treasurer.\n\nAmong the Republicans, there is Steve Hilton, who is best known as a Fox News host, accompanied by Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, best known for his resistance to COVID-19 measures.\n\nThat leaves Rob Bonta, the appointed and then elected attorney general who has been the point man in California\u2019s efforts to resist some of the most egregious edicts of President Trump. Bonta, with nearly 40 lawsuits filed so far against Trump measures, is ahead of Becerra\u2019s pace, and his aggressive demeanor in opposing Trump appears to be what California voters want.\n\nThat, at least, is what we can glean from the behavior of current Gov. Newsom, who puts on the most aggressive front he can in opposing Trump, presumably because that\u2019s what he believes will best feed the preferences of his base. His latest move is to attempt a gerrymandering effort aimed to parry \u2014 at least \u2014 an effort by Texas Republicans to \u201csteal\u201d five currently Democratic Texas seats in Congress. Newsom announced Aug. 14 that the state will hold a November special election to approve redrawn districts meant to give Democrats five more U.S. House seats.\n\nBonta has not yet said much about running for governor, because he seemed to deeply believe Harris would do that job. Since she now says she won\u2019t, though, look for Bonta to take on a very active campaign role, just as he has lately been Trump\u2019s leading legal antagonist.\n\nBonta\u2019s fought Trump over the federal demands for welfare recipients\u2019 IDs, and he\u2019s fought firings at various federal departments. He\u2019s fought against new voting instructions and for offshore wind energy. It\u2019s hard to find an area where he has not stood against Trump, and if that kind of behavior is really what Californians want, expect him to become the front-runner very soon.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com, and read more of his columns online at californiafocus.net.",

      "text": "If U.S. senators don\u2019t work to alleviate the fears of their constituents, they probably aren\u2019t doing their jobs very well.\nThis explains why, even when he knows the measure has no immediate chance for passage, California\u2019s Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla recently introduced new legislation requiring federal immigration enforcement agents to clearly display visible identification during their actions, except those involving stealthy approaches to hideouts of the undocumented.\nIn California, this should not strike anyone as new or dangerous to law enforcement officers. The state penal code already requires uniformed officers to wear badges or nameplates correctly displaying their identification numbers or names. It means on-duty police, sheriff\u2019s deputies and California Highway Patrol officers cannot conceal either their badges or names.\nA current state Senate bill called SB 627 would also make any law enforcement officers masking up while on-duty a misdemeanor, although this most likely could not be enforced on federal officers working for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Border Patrol agencies.\nIn this case such symbolism is important, though, letting the host of mostly brown-skinned California residents, legal or not, now explicitly targeted by immigration agents know that at least some public officials are on their side.\n\u201cWithout visible badges, names or insignia, members of the public often have no way to confirm whether they are interacting with legitimate government officials \u2026 causing widespread confusion and fear, especially in communities already subject to heightened immigration scrutiny,\u201d Padilla says.\nPadilla, like this bill\u2019s New Jersey co-sponsor and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, knows it will not pass the Senate in this session controlled by Republicans aligned with President Trump and his mass-deportation campaign. It means something, though, to many of the targeted \u2014 legitimately or not \u2014 for prominent senators to take their side.\nThen there\u2019s the whole issue of whether immigration agents should be permitted to wear masks or balaclavas in the first place while making arrests. If those under arrest aren\u2019t sure their captors are really government officials, can they be blamed if they resist?\nSo far, the arrested have not only been blamed in such incidents but often beaten. California officers could not do that. They must be identifiable unless working undercover. Yes, they can be masked when conditions justify it, but their badges must still be visible.\nThe U.S. Homeland Security Department has so far justified allowing masks and a lack of any identifying markers during individual and mass arrests by claiming that identification would expose agents and their families to danger. Their danger would be no more severe, though, than the supposed peril of California officers who have been openly identified for years.\nIt\u2019s true that California cops who opposed the current state laws while they were still mere proposals offered precisely the same arguments against identification now being purveyed by Homeland Security. No wave of attacks on California officers has happened, though.\nIn fact, several online search engines indicate that no incidents of targeting cops based on badge or name visibility have been reported \u2014 not even one case in which assailants singled out officers because their uniforms were identifiable as representing a particular agency.\nSo at least in California, no evidence exists for the kind of danger alleged by Homeland Security. However, such incidents may occur now because of the fear and hatred thus far aroused by masked ICE agents.\nFederal rules and laws are not usually based on such conjecture, though. Rather, some actual incidents are usually required for rules to become firm, as they appear to be today.\nThat\u2019s why \u201cour bill is grounded in law enforcement best practices that would prohibit immigration enforcement officers from wearing face coverings and require them to display name or badge number and the agency they represent,\u201d says Padilla. \u201cWe must act to maintain trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\u201d\nThat reasoning may prevail in the U.S. Senate someday but certainly not while Democrats are in the minority there.\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com, and read more of his columns online at californiafocus.net."

      "text": "There can be no doubt that the relatively few Californians strongly interested in becoming an independent country have had high hopes that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cWar on California\u201d would drive many new adherents to their camp. So far, it\u2019s not happening at a level that can be taken seriously. That\u2019s the upshot of a new poll taken by the YouGov survey service for the Carlsbad-based Independent California Institute (ICI).\nLet\u2019s list a few things Trump has done to harm California: He\u2019s eliminated the state\u2019s unique ability to make smog rules for the state\u2019s vehicles, once thought securely written into the 1970 Clean Air Act. He\u2019s invented a series of Los Angeles \u201criots,\u201d which at most were a few incidents of vandalism, and used it to send thousands of soldiers into Southern California. He\u2019s also eliminated funding to bring English-learning schoolchildren and migrant kids into the academic mainstream.\nThese are just a few anti-California measures he\u2019s taken, besides ordering the region to undergo the nation\u2019s most intensive deportation drive ever, claiming to go after seriously criminal illegal immigrants but mostly picking up undocumented workers who broke no other laws. Apparently, all this has not yet had a huge negative impact on mainstream Californians.\nThe new poll does say Californians\u2019 confidence in the federal government has nosedived since Trump took office, with 50% of Californians saying they now trust Sacramento more than Washington, D.C., and just 23% holding the opposite view. Those numbers are significantly changed from February, when only 34% trusted Sacramento more while 18% trusted the feds.\nWhen asked if they\u2019d vote for a peaceful secession ballot initiative, though, only 44% were in favor, with 54% against. Is it possible Californians could shift radically to the side of secession in the foreseeable future?\n\u201cIt would probably take something quite direct,\u201d says Coyote Codornices Marin, the ICI\u2019s director. \u201cFor instance, if Trump were to say something like \u2018We don\u2019t need California,\u2019 that could seriously drive secession. But I strongly doubt he would ever be stupid enough to say that.\u201d\nEven without such a seminal event, 71% of Californians believe they\u2019d be better off if California somehow gained special autonomous status within the United States, something that seems ever less likely under the Trump administration, which seems bent on allowing California less autonomy, not more.\nThis reality does not faze the 60% of Californians who said they want California\u2019s 52-member House delegation in Congress to back autonomy with \u201chardball tactics\u201d like refusing to vote for federal budgets as long as California receives billions of dollars less in federal spending than it pays in federal taxes.\nOther significant findings in the poll of 500 Californians included 71% wanting a new state law enforcement division focused on violent extremism and hate crimes, rather than leaving such enforcement strictly up to local police and sheriffs.\nA similar 72% want California police to have authority to arrest federal immigration officials who \u201cact maliciously or knowingly exceed their authority under federal law.\u201d Also, 80% want California to control its borders \u201cmore like a country,\u201d checking for illegal firearms and other types of contraband, rather than merely seeking out perishable fruit.\n\u201cCalifornians are ready to govern themselves and are focused on pragmatic solutions,\u201d says Timothy Vollmer, the ICI\u2019s vice chair.\nThat leaves out the Trump factor, though. The president wants exactly the reverse from California, and seems most compliant with California desires when they are addressed to him with abject obsequiousness.\n\u201cYes, our poll numbers for secession are at a record high,\u201d said the ICI\u2019s Marin, who added, though, that the numbers also indicate a steep uphill climb would still be required, especially without special autonomous status as a step in that direction.\n\u201cMany people just don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to be sovereign in the immediate future,\u201d said Marin.\nThat could change, though, if Trump\u2019s steadfast irritation with California becomes more active and focused on depriving Californians of basic rights.\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com, and read more of his columns online at californiafocus.net."

      "text": "The ill effects of cannabis use have been well known for generations: spaced out behavior, impaired judgment, clouded or heightened senses depending on your personal biology, a distorted sense of time, slowed reactions, lower motor skills, reduced inhibitions, less mental focus and memory.\nThat\u2019s only part of the list, which some claim is balanced by the relaxing effects of marijuana and its partially proven ability to ease the pain caused by some medical treatments. Despite all the harms of marijuana, California legislators have steadily pushed increases in its use ever since recreational pot sales became legal via a 2016 state ballot initiative.\nNow California\u2019s Assembly has passed yet another measure to ease life for pot shops. If passed by the state Senate, this one, known as AB 564 and sponsored by Assemblymember Matt Haney, D-San Francisco, would lower the state excise tax on legal pot from the 19% it automatically reached on July 1 back to 15% until at least 2030, squashing a potential future increase to 25%.\nThis measure is designed to protect legal pot prices from being undercut by untaxed illegal growers whose product is widely available on the black market. It comes just a year after legislators also tried to help legal pot use by allowing Amsterdam-style lounges that could serve food and drinks along with varieties of marijuana.\nThe real question here is what legalized pot has done to deserve the most-favored-business status informally bestowed upon it by lawmakers. No one has produced any information to refute the long list of harmful pot effects, and two new studies originating in Northern California raise new questions about continued recreational sales of cannabis.\nOne, co-authored by researchers from the Kaiser Permanente health care service and Oakland\u2019s regional Public Health Institute, found that teenagers living in areas with more cannabis stores experience significantly higher rates of mental health issues.\nThe study used data from nearly 96,000 insured adolescents, finding that those in cities or counties without pot stores are significantly less likely to have been diagnosed with psychotic disorders. Researchers found that greater retail activity and availability \u2014 regardless of laws prohibiting sales to those younger than 18 \u2014 translated to higher rates of diagnosed psychotic, depressive and anxiety disorders.\n\u201cThis study reinforces the importance of where and how cannabis is sold in protecting adolescent mental health,\u201d said Lynn Silver, M.D., a program director at the Public Health Institute.\nAlmost simultaneously, a UC San Francisco study determined that long-term cannabis use is linked to a greater likelihood of developing heart disease. The risk stems from reduced blood vessel function, according to the study published in the American Medical Association\u2019s journal Cardiology.\nThe study involved 55 \u201coutwardly healthy persons between 18 and 50.\u201d It revealed that eating edible marijuana products like gummies has the same impact on heart health as smoking pot. Study subjects had been consuming marijuana in one form or another at least three times weekly for a year or more.\nAll of these regular users were discovered to have \u201cdecreased vascular function,\u201d comparable to regular smokers. Their blood vessel capacity was found to be roughly half as high as among noncannabis users. We already knew marijuana use was harmful for bunches of reasons, but direct proof of significant long-term physical harm has been hard to find.\nThe findings reinforce a year-old study from the American Psychiatric Association warning that individuals who want to remain mentally sharp in old age (defined as 65 and older) should not smoke pot regularly or eat pot-laced products, which range from chocolates to layer cakes.\nThe question here is not whether marijuana use is harmful. That\u2019s been known for at least a century, even if some details are only now emerging. The real question is why California legislators are so supportive of this harmful industry, treating it with kid gloves even as other drugs get harsh treatment.\nYes, campaign contributions by pot-linked labor unions like the United Food and Commercial Workers no doubt play a role in bringing near-unanimous votes on laws this industry wants passed. So do tax receipts. But legislators should be able to resist those pressures. This leads to another question: What drug are legislators using when they give sustained favored status to an industry that does much more harm than good?\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com, and read more of his columns online at californiafocus.net."
