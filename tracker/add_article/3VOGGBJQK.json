      "summary": "Bond markets rattled by Chinese President Xi’s military parade, with U.S. Treasury yields and Japan’s 30‑year yields climbing, while gold surged to an all‑time high of $3,546.99.  U.S. sterling fell after 30‑year gilt yields hit a 1998‑level peak.  Markets are pricing an 89% chance of a 25‑basis‑point Fed rate cut this month, and equity futures in Europe are nudging into positive territory ahead of key PMI releases and U.S. payroll data.",
