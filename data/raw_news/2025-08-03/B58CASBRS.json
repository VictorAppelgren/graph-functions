  "description": "Trump allegedly has 'concerns' about Bureau of Labor Statistics data.",
  "content": "U.S Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CBS that Trump had \u201creal concerns\u201d about the data, while Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said the president \u201cis right to call for new leadership.\u201d Hassett said on Fox News the main concern was Friday\u2019s BLS report of net downward revisions showing 258,000 fewer jobs had been created in May and June than previously reported. Trump accused BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of faking the jobs numbers without providing any evidence of data manipulation. The BLS compiles the closely watched employment report as well as consumer and producer price data.\n\nThe BLS gave no reason for the revised data but noted that \u201cmonthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\u201d McEntarfer\u2019s firing added to growing concerns about the quality of U.S. economic data published by the federal government and came on the heels of a raft of new U.S. tariffs on dozens of trading partners, sending global stock markets tumbling as Trump presses ahead with plans to reorder the global economy. \u201cI think what we need is a fresh set of eyes at the BLS, somebody who can clean this thing up,\u201d Hassett said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Greer acknowledged there were always revisions of job numbers, \u201cbut sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.\u201d Critics, including former leaders of the BLS, slammed Trump\u2019s move and called on Congress to investigate McEntarfer\u2019s removal, saying it would undermine trust in a respected statistical agency. There was no way a commissioner could rig the jobs numbers, said William Beach, a former BLS commissioner and co-chair of the group Friends of the BLS.\n\n\u201cEvery year we\u2019ve revised the numbers. When I was commissioner, we had a 500,000 job revision during President Trump\u2019s first term,\u201d Beach said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union. \u201cAnd why do we do that? Because firms are created or firms go out of business, and we don\u2019t really know that during the course of our of the year, until we reconcile against a real full count of all the businesses.\u201d Democrats and at least two Republican senators also criticized the firing.\n\n\u201cThis is a preposterous charge. These numbers are put together by teams of literally hundreds of people following detailed procedures that are in manuals,\u201d former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWhat does a bad leader do when they get bad news? Shoot the messenger,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor on Friday. The firing came amid a flurry of economic upheaval last week.\n\nJust hours before the tariff deadline on Friday, Trump signed an executive order imposing duties on U.S. imports from countries including Canada, Brazil, India and Taiwan, in his latest round of levies as countries attempted to seek ways to reach better deals. Greer and Hassett said on Sunday the bulk of those tariffs are likely to stay in place rather than be cut as part of continuing negotiations. India pushed back on Trump\u2019s threats of an additional penalty if it kept purchasing oil from Russia, two Indian government sources told Reuters on Saturday. Trump imposed a new 25 percent tariff on Indian goods.",
