  "description": "Saturday's game takes on new edge after Gundy's $40M spending claim and Lanning's response about investing in championship-caliber teams.",
  "content": "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2014 Mike Gundy didn\u2019t sound like he was trying to stir the pot, but stir it he did.\n\nDuring his weekly radio show, the Oklahoma State head coach made a pointed comparison between his program\u2019s NIL spending and what he believes Oregon is shelling out to build its roster.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent around $7 million over the last three years,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cI think Oregon spent close to $40 million last year alone. I might be off a few million, but the point is: they\u2019re spending a lot. Some schools are doing that.\u201d\n\nGundy went on to describe Oregon as one of college football\u2019s financial powerhouses, long backed by Nike co-founder, and Ducks alumnus, Phil Knight.\n\nHe even name-dropped Ducks quarterback Dante Moore as an example of the kind of talent that requires serious investment to retain.\n\nBut Gundy\u2019s comments weren\u2019t just about Oregon \u2014 they were about the shifting landscape of college football. He expressed concern over how money is beginning to influence even non-conference scheduling.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from coaches around the country is that non-conference games should be scheduled based on financial parity,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cOregon is paying a lot of money for their team. So some coaches think they should only play teams spending at a similar level.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a striking statement, especially considering Oklahoma State and Oregon agreed to this home-and-home series back in 2018, long before NIL and revenue-sharing changed the game.\n\nWhen Oregon head coach Dan Lanning was asked about Gundy\u2019s remarks, he didn\u2019t shy away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a ton of respect for Coach Gundy,\u201d Lanning said. \u201cBut how blessed are we to be at a place that\u2019s invested in winning? If you want to be a top-10 team, you better be invested. We spend to win. Some people save to have an excuse for why they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLanning also pointed to Oklahoma State\u2019s Week 1 opponent, FCS program UT Martin, as a counter to the idea of matching schedules by budget.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve got in their pockets,\u201d Lanning added. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure UT Martin didn\u2019t have as much as them last week, and they still played.\u201d\n\nBoth teams enter Week 2 coming off wins against FCS opponents.\n\nOregon is once again in the College Football Playoff conversation, while Oklahoma State is looking to bounce back from its worst season under Gundy.\n\nNow, with millions in spending and a few sharp words in the mix, Saturday\u2019s matchup on CBS has a little extra edge.",
