  "content": "With the earnings season almost done, investors are turning to economic data for clues on whether the Fed will be able cut rates in September. The S&P 500 remained below 6,400. Apple Inc. slid after its best week since 2020. Intel Corp. climbed as its chief was expected to meet with President Donald Trump.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\n\u201cThe market\u2019s reaction to any surprises in the numbers could be exaggerated \u2014 especially if a significantly hotter-than-expected CPI print leads traders to believe the Fed may not cut rates at its next meeting,\u201d said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s two vice chairs, Michelle Bowman and Philip Jefferson, and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan are under consideration to serve as chair of the central bank when the position opens next year, according to two administration officials. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will interview additional candidates in the coming weeks, said the officials.\n\nTrump also said he hopes China will massively step up its purchases of American soybeans, even as the Asian nation has yet to book any cargoes for the upcoming season and is stepping up rare exports of the product.\n\nThe long-troubled lithium market received a boost when China\u2019s CATL, the world\u2019s biggest battery producer, confirmed the closure of its Jianxiawo mine on Monday, saying it\u2019s seeking to renew its expired permit. Shares of North American producers soared as investors bet that the suspension would ease a supply glut and likely lead to a rebound in prices.\n\nIn the US, the core consumer price index, regarded as a measure of underlying inflation because it strips out volatile food and energy costs, will show a 0.3% increase for July, according to the median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt about it, CPI will not be good,\u201d said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. \u201cThe bigger question is \u2018does it matter?\u2019 We think not. Inflation will remain sticky, with potholes, but a weakening employment situation will commandeer the Fed outlook.\u201d",
