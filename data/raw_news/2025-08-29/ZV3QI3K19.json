  "title": "\u2018Landmark\u2019 Climate Change Opinion Promised Reforms, May Be A Paper Tiger",
  "description": "In July, the World Court issued an opinion obligating countries to prevent climate change. Now that the fanfare has faded, its actual influence is questionable",
  "content": "In July, the International Court of Justice released an Advisory Opinion on the Obligations of States in Respect of Climate Change. The opinion claimed that countries were legally required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and may have to pay reparations for damages from climate change. For climate activists, it was a landmark victory. However, the international community has largely ignored the opinion, bringing into question its significance and challenging the credibility of the Court.\n\nIn March 2023, the UN General Assembly asked the ICJ to issue an advisory opinion on the legal obligations of countries in preventing climate change. Over the following two years, over 90 countries engaged in written and oral arguments over the interpretations of treaties and what legal obligations exist under customary international law.\n\nDeveloping countries asserted that the Paris Agreement created a legal liability for countries to meet the goal of net zero by 2050. They also argued that countries who contribute to climate change, through the production of fossil fuels and GHG emissions, should pay reparations to low lying and developing nations that are \u201cadversely impacted\u201d by climate change.\n\nMuch of the legal debate comes from the obligations states have under the Paris Agreement to submit reports to the UN. Article 4, paragraph 2 of the Agreement requires countries to \u201cprepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve. Parties shall pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of such contributions.\u201d\n\nThese NDCs outline actions taken by the the countries to reduce GHG emission. Throughout the legal proceedings, this process was referred to as procedural, meaning that countries are only required to go through the process of creating the report. The debate arose over whether there is a substantive, or actual action, required to enact the goals of the NDC. A substantive requirement creates a legal liability to act and could lead to legal consequences for failure to act.\n\nFollowing two years of proceedings, including both written and oral statements, the Court issued its Advisory Opinion relating to the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change on July 23. The opinion created a new wave of liability for countries to address climate change, both within and beyond the confines of the Paris Agreement. The Court found that the NDCs were legally binding, creating legal obligations for countries to act and to change national law to align with those goals.\n\nWhile climate activists were quick to offer comments on the opinion, world leaders have been largely silent. Select foreign ministers offered generic acknowledgments of the opinion while reaffirming their countries\u2019 commitment to prevent climate change. Some differed, saying they need time to review. A month after the opinion, reaction has gone silent.\n\nAs an attorney practicing in this field, I have had the opportunity to engage in multiple high level discussions on the opinion. Behind closed doors, the response has been indifference and dismissive, even when it was to their advantage.\n\nThat may change at COP 30, when world leaders gather in Brazil to discuss progress relating to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Paris Agreement. The annual meeting is already off to a rocky start, as parts of the Amazon were destroyed to build a highway to the summit site. Climate activists will lean heavily on the ICJ opinion to justify stricter enforcement of the Paris Agreement. However, that may have a chilling effect on reforms.\n\nMany countries openly admitted in their oral statements that the goals set under the Paris Agreement were aspirational, not binding. This understanding of the treaty allowed national leaders to make grand promises, without any intentions of meeting those goals. With no enforcement mechanism, leaders could say anything without consequence.\n\nUnder the claim that any promises made will now be legally enforced through litigation by climate activists, smart national leaders will shy away from new commitments. At minimum, the will clarify that they are only aspirational and not binding, removing the threat of enforcement.\n\nNotably the U.S. will be absent in the debate, as President Trump left the Paris Agreement and associated UNFCCC, making them no longer a \u201cparty\u201d for the Conference of Parties. While the effective date of the exit is not official until January 2026, the Trump Administration has made it clear they considered the exit effective as of January 20, 2025. While it is unclear if the Trump Administration will send anyone, the absence of a delegation may be a strategic error.\n\nThe chilling effect may be the only real consequence of the opinion as actual enforcement is difficult. The problem arises in the limited jurisdiction of the court.\n\nMany have mistakenly referred to the ICJ as the \u201cworld\u2019s highest court.\u201d The term refers to the top court in a jurisdiction, typically called supreme, as they are \u201csuperior to all others.\u201d While it is known as the World Court, the ICJ is not the highest court. Rather, it is a specialized court developed by treaty to handle specific disputes between nations. Decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court cannot be appealed to the ICJ.\n\nAdditionally, ICJ opinions do not hold influence SCOTUS. In 1985, the U.S. withdrew from \u201cgeneral jurisdictional competence\u201d of the ICJ, effectively removing influence by requiring the U.S. to agree to participate in litigation before the Court. In the 1998 case of Beard v. Greene, SCOTUS ignored an order by the ICJ requesting a stay of execution.\n\nThis feeds the general indifference relating to the opinion. The ICJ, like most courts, has no real enforcement mechanism. The advisory opinion was non-binding. It only provided guidance on how countries should interpret the obligations. While a legal challenge can be brought before the court, it can only be filed by a country and with the agreement of all parties. A high GHG emitting country will have to agree to be sued.\n\nLegal actions by activists must be brought in national courts, and most likely in the court of the country being sued. Unless national law allows for enforcement of these opinion or treaties through their courts, success will be difficult. In the U.S., an outlying lower court may accept the argument, but this SCOTUS will reject it upon appeal. The most likely pathway for success will be in European courts, specifically the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThat lands this back to being a political debate. No political opinions were changed as a result of the opinion. Only those closely following these developments are even aware the opinion exists. Those are almost exclusively within climate change circles. For the rest of society, it is business as usual.\n\nWhat climate activists thought would signal a landmark shift in the debate, has, for now, become a footnote. It will be cited in climate change cases around the world, but may ultimately end up being a paper tiger - looking strong but having no real power.",

      "text": "On July 23, the International Court of Justice released its Advisory Opinion relating to the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change. The Court found that developed countries, like the United States, must take action to reduce GHG emissions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Those countries could also be required to pay reparations to developing countries that are \u201cadversely impacted\u201d by the effects of climate change. The opinion, while non-binding, gives teeth to the Paris Agreement and reinforces many concerns expressed by President Trump.\nThe Paris Agreement is an international treaty adopted in 2015 to address the impacts of climate change. The agreement sets a goal of reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. To reach that goal, a series of policies were adopted to address how governments and businesses reduce and report GHG emissions. It also focused on funding of both climate change initiatives and the economic impacts of climate change.\nIn 2019, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the treaty, only for President Joe Biden to rejoin in 2021. On January 20, 2025, Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the U.S. from the agreement for a second time.\nThe justifications can be found in a June 2017 statement by Trump.\n\u201cThere are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives. Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America\u2019s sovereignty\u2026\n\u201cThe risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point \u2014 as bad as it is \u2014 not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States\u2019 sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.\u201d\nThat legal liability has become a reality.\nIn March 2023, at the request of Vanuatu, the UN General Assembly asked the ICJ to issue an advisory opinion on the legal obligations of countries in preventing climate change. The opinion gives an indicator of how the Court may interpret future climate related litigation and guide future legislative development. Following two years of proceedings, including both written and oral statements, the Court issued its opinion, and a shorter summary of the opinion, on July 23.\nThe opinion started with the obligations in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. During the proceedings, a divide was formed between large, developed countries and developing countries.\nOne particular legal debate related to the obligations states have under the Paris Agreement. Article 4, paragraph 2 of the Agreement requires countries to \u201cprepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve. Parties shall pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of such contributions.\u201d\nThese NDCs outline actions taken by the the countries to reduce GHG emission. Throughout the Court\u2019s proceedings, this process was been referred to as procedural, meaning that countries are only required to go through the process of creating the report. Notably, this argument was made by attorneys representing the Biden Administration.\nThe debate arises over whether there is a substantive, or actual action, required to enact the goals of the NDC. A substantive requirement creates a legal liability to act and could lead to legal consequences for failure to act.\nTo justify the substantive argument, advocates point to Article 4, paragraph 3 that states successive NDCs \u201cwill represent a progression beyond the Party\u2019s then current nationally determined contribution and reflect its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.\u201d\nDeveloping countries also argued that the goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050, and the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 C are aspirational and not legally binding. However, the Court disagreed.\nThe Court determined that NDCs, steps to reduce GHG emissions, and the 1.5 C target are not aspirational, rather countries have a legal obligation to meet those goals. Further, the Court said failure to act could bring legal liability.\nAccording to the Court, if developed countries fail to take action to mitigate the impacts of climate change, developing states that are \u201cadversely impacted\u201d by climate change can take legal action. If successful, high GHG emitting countries will have a \u201cduty to make reparation.\u201d Reparation can come in the form of restitution, like \u201creconstructing damaged or destroyed infrastructure, and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity\", or compensation.\nWhile the ICJ\u2019s Advisory Opinion relating to the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change was non-binding, it will be used as a strong legal argument in future cases. Expect a wave of litigation relating to climate change. It will not take long for developing countries to file complaints before the ICJ seeking damages from the United States, China, Australia, and the European Union. Activists will also use the opinion in national courts to challenge both the actions of governments and of companies."

      "text": "Amazon forest felled to build road for climate summit\nA new four-lane highway cutting through tens of thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest is being built for the COP30 climate summit in the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m.\nIt aims to ease traffic to the city, which will host more than 50,000 people - including world leaders - at the conference in November.\nThe state government touts the highway's \"sustainable\" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact.\nThe Amazon plays a vital role in absorbing carbon for the world and providing biodiversity, and many say this deforestation contradicts the very purpose of a climate summit.\nAlong the partially built road, lush rainforest towers on either side - a reminder of what was once there. Logs are piled high in the cleared land which stretches more than 13km (8 miles) through the rainforest into Bel\u00e9m.\nDiggers and machines carve through the forest floor, paving over wetland to surface the road which will cut through a protected area.\nClaudio Verequete lives about 200m from where the road will be. He used to make an income from harvesting a\u00e7a\u00ed berries from trees that once occupied the space.\n\"Everything was destroyed,\" he says, gesturing at the clearing.\n\"Our harvest has already been cut down. We no longer have that income to support our family.\"\nHe says he has received no compensation from the state government and is currently relying on savings.\nHe worries the construction of this road will lead to more deforestation in the future, now that the area is more accessible for businesses.\n\"Our fear is that one day someone will come here and say: 'Here's some money. We need this area to build a gas station, or to build a warehouse.' And then we'll have to leave.\n\"We were born and raised here in the community. Where are we going to go?\"\nHis community won't be connected to the road, given its walls on either side.\n\"For us who live on the side of the highway, there will be no benefits. There will be benefits for the trucks that will pass through. If someone gets sick, and needs to go to the centre of Bel\u00e9m, we won't be able to use it.\"\nThe road leaves two disconnected areas of protected forest. Scientists are concerned it will fragment the ecosystem and disrupt the movement of wildlife.\nProf Silvia Sardinha is a wildlife vet and researcher at a university animal hospital that overlooks the site of the new highway.\nShe and her team rehabilitate wild animals with injuries, predominantly caused by humans or vehicles.\nOnce healed, they release them back into the wild \u2013 something she says will be harder if there is a highway on their doorstep.\n\"From the moment of deforestation, there is a loss.\n\"We are going to lose an area to release these animals back into the wild, the natural environment of these species,\" she said.\n\"Land animals will no longer be able to cross to the other side too, reducing the areas where they can live and breed.\"\nThe Brazilian president and environment minister say this will be a historic summit because it is \"a COP in the Amazon, not a COP about the Amazon\".\nThe president says the meeting will provide an opportunity to focus on the needs of the Amazon, show the forest to the world, and present what the federal government has done to protect it.\nBut Prof Sardinha says that while these conversations will happen \"at a very high level, among business people and government officials\", those living in the Amazon are \"not being heard\".\nThe state government of Par\u00e1 had touted the idea of this highway, known as Avenida Liberdade, as early as 2012, but it had repeatedly been shelved because of environmental concerns.\nNow a host of infrastructure projects have been resurrected or approved to prepare the city for the COP summit.\nAdler Silveira, the state government's infrastructure secretary, listed this highway as one of 30 projects happening in the city to \"prepare\" and \"modernise\" it, so \"we can have a legacy for the population and, more importantly, serve people for COP30 in the best possible way\".\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said it was a \"sustainable highway\" and an \"important mobility intervention\".\nHe added it would have wildlife crossings for animals to pass over, bike lanes and solar lighting. New hotels are also being built and the port is being redeveloped so cruise ships can dock there to accommodate excess visitors.\nBrazil's federal government is investing more than $81m (\u00a362m) to expand the airport capacity from \"seven to 14 million passengers\". A new 500,000 sq-m city park, Parque da Cidade, is under construction. It will include green spaces, restaurants, a sports complex and other facilities for the public to use afterwards.\nSome business owners in the city's vast open-air Ver-o-peso market agree that this development will bring opportunities for the city.\n\"The city as a whole is being improved, it is being repaired and a lot of people are visiting from other places. It means I can sell more and earn more,\" says Dalci Cardoso da Silva, who runs a leather shoe stall.\nHe says this is necessary because when he was young, Bel\u00e9m was \"beautiful, well-kept, well cared for\", but it has since been \"abandoned\" and \"neglected\" with \"little interest from the ruling class\".\nJo\u00e3o Alexandre Trindade da Silva, who sells Amazonian herbal medicines in the market, acknowledges that all construction work can cause problems, but he felt the future impact would be worth it.\n\"We hope the discussions aren't just on paper and become real actions. And the measures, the decisions taken, really are put into practice so that the planet can breathe a little better, so that the population in the future will have a little cleaner air.\"\nThat will be the hope of world leaders too who choose to attend the COP30 summit.\nScrutiny is growing over whether flying thousands of them across the world, and the infrastructure required to host them, is undermining the cause.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt, delivered every Tuesday.

      "text": "The European Court of Human Rights issued a landmark opinion on April 9 establishing protection from the effects of climate change as a human right under European law.\nThe court found that inaction by Switzerland to meet its legal requirements under the Paris Agreement violated the plaintiffs\u2019 right to respect for private and family life. The opinion was released the same day the court dismissed a higher profile climate change case.\nVerein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz and Others v. Switzerland was brought by \u201cfour women and a Swiss association, Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz, whose members are all older women concerned about the consequences of global warming on their living conditions and health.\u201d They claimed that the Swiss authorities failed to take sufficient legislative action to mitigate the effects of climate change, as required under the Paris Agreement.\nThe Paris Agreement, adopted by 196 parties at the COP21, the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris France, set a goal to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0 C by reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 45% by 2030, and reaching net zero by 2050. While the Paris Agreement is legally binding, the enforcement of those obligations has yet to be truly tested.\nIn March 2023, the United Nations General Assembly requested the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on the legal obligations of countries in preventing climate change. The opinion, Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change, while non-binding, will give an indicator of how the court may interpret future climate related litigation and guide future legislative development. That opinion will most likely not be released until 2025.\nIn Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz v. Switzerland, the plaintiffs argued that enforcement of the Paris Agreement could be made through the European Convention on Human Rights. Specifically, they point to Articles 2 (Right to life), 6, (Right to a fair trial), and 8 (Right to respect for private and family life). The court agreed, stating in a press release:\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nInadequate State action to combat climate change exacerbates the risks of harmful consequences and subsequent threats for the enjoyment of human rights \u2013 threats already recognised by governments worldwide and confirmed by scientific knowledge. Having regard to the causal relationship between State actions and/or omissions relating to climate change and the harm, or risk of harm, affecting individuals, the Court found that Article 8 must be seen as encompassing a right for individuals to effective protection by the State authorities from serious adverse effects of climate change on their life, health, well-being and quality of life.\nFurther, the court stated:\nThe Court found that Switzerland had failed to comply with its duties (\u201cpositive obligations\u201d) under the Convention concerning climate change. The Swiss authorities had not acted in time and in an appropriate way to devise, develop and implement relevant legislation and measures to mitigate the effects of climate change in this case.\nWhile the court stated that the Swiss were in violation of the convention, the penalty was minimum. The Swiss government was ordered to pay EUR 80,000 to cover legal costs and expenses of the plaintiffs. No further damages were awarded as the plaintiffs did not ask for any.\nThe court also did not direct specific action by the Swiss government, stating in the judgement:\nThe Court further points out that its judgments are essentially declaratory in nature and that, in general, it is primarily for the State concerned to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the means to be used in its domestic legal order in order to discharge its obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions and spirit of the Court\u2019s judgment.\nIn the present case, having regard to the complexity and the nature of the issues involved, the Court is unable to be detailed or prescriptive as regards any measures to be implemented in order to effectively comply with the present judgment.\nIn other words, the court found that Switzerland is violating the convention, but is leaving it to the leaders of the Council of Europe to find a solution.\nThe higher profile case, Duarte Agostinho and Others v. Portugal and 32 Others, was brought in September 2020 by six Portuguese nationals, born between 1999 and 2012. The plaintiffs allege that 33 signatory states to the Paris Agreement failed to comply with their commitments to limit the impacts of climate change. That case would have had a broader repercussion to all 33 signatory states. However, that case was dismissed because the plaintiffs failed to properly avail themselves of the courts of Portugal before appealing to the ECHR.\nWhile this is a major victory for climate change activists, the reach of the impact may be limited. Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz v. Switzerland is specifically targeted at the actions of Switzerland but does open the door to further litigation and could influence the interpretation of a state\u2019s obligations relating to climate change in their respective courts. It may also become a factor in the ICJ climate change opinion."

      "text": "At the request of the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of Justice reviewed the financial liability of countries for their contribution to climate change and what actions countries must take to prevent climate change. After over two years of proceedings, the ICJ released its Advisory Opinion relating to the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change on July 23. The Court found that large GHG emitting countries, like the United States, could be liable to pay reparations to smaller countries for the adverse impacts of climate change. While the opinion is non-binding, it will shape the future debate over climate change policy and lead to a wave of new lawsuits.\nThe ICJ was established in 1945 through the UN Charter to handle legal disputes between nations. Known as the World Court, it is an outlet for countries to settle civil disputes through a neutral court. The ICJ is composed of 15 judges elected by the UNGA and UN Council to serve a term of nine years. A country may only have one judge serving on the ICJ at a time.\nOn March 29, 2023, at the request of Vanuatu, the UNGA asked the ICJ to issue an advisory opinion on the legal obligations of countries in preventing climate change. The opinion, while non-binding, will give an indicator of how the Court may interpret future climate related litigation and guide future legislative development. Following two years of proceedings, including both written and oral statements, the Court issued its opinion, and a shorter summary of the opinion, on July 23.\nThe UNGA posed two questions to the ICJ:\n\u201cWhat are the obligations of States under international law to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases for States and for present and future generations\u201d?\n\u201cWhat are the legal consequences under these obligations for States where they, by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment, with respect to: (i) States, including, in particular, small island developing States, which due to their geographical circumstances and level of development, are injured or specially affected by or are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change? (ii) Peoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change?\u201d\nAddressing the first question, large countries, including the United States, Australia, and Germany, argued that the creation of a treaty that specifically addresses climate change overrides any other international law on the subject. This is known as lex specialis. Therefore, no additional legal obligations exist that may create a call for reparations or action not directly negotiated.\nDeveloping countries argued that the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement are a starting point, but that the impacts of climate change violate human rights under international common law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As a result, those countries that contribute to climate change, through the production of fossil fuels and GHG emissions, should pay reparations to low lying and developing nations that are \u201cadversely impacted\u201d by climate change. The Court agreed, finding that the obligations to prevent climate change are found under customary international law.\nThe Court stated, \u201cThe customary duty to prevent transboundary environmental harm, which requires States to \u2018use all the means at [their] disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in [their] territory, or in any area under [their] jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State\u2019, also applies to the climate system, which is an integral and vitally important part of the environment and which must be protected for present and future generations.\"\nThe Court\u2019s rejection of lex specialis effectively renders Trump\u2019s exit from the Paris Agreement as moot when it comes to liability.\nThe court established that liability in two parts, or elements. \"The main elements of the obligation of prevention in the context of protection of the climate system are (a) the environmental harm to be prevented and (b) due diligence as the required standard of conduct.\u201d\nThe court addressed the two parts of the obligation and provided more context.\nAddressing the environmental harm to be prevented, the court stated:\n\"For the duty to prevent to arise, there must be a risk of significant harm to the environment. Whether an activity constitutes a risk of significant harm depends on both the probability or foreseeability of the occurrence of harm and its severity or magnitude and should therefore be determined by, among other factors, an assessment of the risk and level of harm combined. The Court is of the view that a risk of significant harm may also be present in situations where significant harm to the environment is caused by the cumulative effect of different acts undertaken by various States and by private actors subject to their respective jurisdiction or control.\n\"The determination of 'significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment\u2019 must take into account the best available science. The question whether any specific harm, or risk of harm, to a State constitutes a relevant adverse effect of climate change must be assessed in concreto in each individual situation.\"\nLooking at the due diligence requirement, the Court listed seven factors that should be considered when determining if a country took the necessary steps to prevent environmental harm. Generally, those are (1) laws or regulations to reduce GHG emissions; (2) availability of scientific information; (3) binding and non-binding agreements from COPs; (4) \u201cthe principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities; (5) \u201dscientific information regarding the probability and the seriousness of possible harm; (6) risk assessments relating to GHG emissions; and (7) \u201cStates\u2019 notification of and consultation in good faith with other States where planned activities within their jurisdiction or control create a risk of significant harm or significantly affect collective efforts to address harm to the climate system.\u201d\nThe opinion is a huge win for climate change activists. While it is non-binding, it is important to note that any disputes between countries will be heard before the International Court of Justice, the same court that issues the advisory opinion. It is also likely that some national courts will adopt the same legal interpretations. Expect litigation based on the opinion to begin within the next few weeks."

  "argos_summary": "The International Court of Justice released a non\u2011binding advisory opinion on July\u202f23 that declares developed countries have a legal duty to reduce greenhouse\u2011gas emissions and may owe reparations to affected states. While the ruling provides a legal framework that climate activists can cite in future litigation, the Court\u2019s lack of enforcement power and the muted response from world leaders mean the opinion is unlikely to change policy immediately. The opinion could spur a wave of climate\u2011related lawsuits and influence national courts, but its impact will depend on how states incorporate its principles into domestic law. Meanwhile, the upcoming COP30 in Brazil is already marred by infrastructure projects that undermine the summit\u2019s environmental goals, illustrating the gap between rhetoric and action.",
