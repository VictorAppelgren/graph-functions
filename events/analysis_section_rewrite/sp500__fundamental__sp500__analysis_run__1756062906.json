      "feedback": "Strengths: the draft assembles a coherent multi‑year regime thesis (domestic semis/AI, reoriented supply chains, and tariffs‑as‑leverage) and ties Ford as a cyclical proxy with explicit Ford metrics (17% YTD, 5.18% dividend yield, forward P/E ~10.3) plus CEO‑pay dynamics as governance signal; it also sensibly flags inflation and policy‑risk spillovers. Gaps and concrete edits to reach world‑class quality: 1) add a formal, first‑principles regime map with invariant anchors (e.g., real rate differentials, terms of trade for tech/semis, productivity, net external position, and a simple policy‑reaction function). Define Regimes and transition triggers: Regime A = baseline tariff cadence (baseline 10% then escalation on China), Regime B = China retaliation/shifting ally alignment, Regime C = domestic capex surge in chips/data centers with energy‑grid backing; specify transition cues (tariff announcements, capex announcements, AI/EW technology milestones). 2) sharpen the transmission mechanism from regime shifts to markets with a clean causal chain: tariffs raise imported‑input costs and inflation risk, driving rates up or risk premia in tech/industrial names, prompting capital reallocation to U.S. fabs, AI data‑centers, and energy infra; map each link to observable price signals (Ford’s margins and ROI risk, tech stock multiples, dividend yields). 3) quantify base‑case paths using available numbers: anchor Ford as an income play (dividend, P/E), cite RoIC/ROE framing from ROIC material only where relevant to governance incentives (SGB2PAZGK/65UUBU0OR); avoid loose statements—provide a plausible band for capex impact and inflation risk tied to the cited tariffs, even if ranges are qualitative. 4) reconcile conflicts and broaden source coverage: acknowledge the policy debate (tariffs as security vs inflation drag) while grounding market pricing in observable metrics; ensure citations cover all critical sources (O4ZEED2EB for CEO pay, 22PL3Q360 and 65UUBU0OR for Ford, SGB2PAZGK for Trump‑era policy) and avoid extrapolations beyond what the sources support. 5) structure “base case, risks, what to watch, confidence” as a tight forecast arc: specify watch items (tariff cadence, capex announcements, Ford EV profitability trajectory, data‑center energy costs, and CEO‑pay signaling as governance discipline) and attach a concise confidence range (e.g., moderate) with explicit transition risks if tariffs accelerate or China/ally responses shift. This will yield a rigorous, multi‑year, first‑principles‑driven piece aligned to SECTION FOCUS.",
