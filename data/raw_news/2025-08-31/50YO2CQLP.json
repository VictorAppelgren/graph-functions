  "description": "Cedar Point's parent company reports 9% attendance drop and $500 million in debt as CEO announces departure following troubled merger.",
  "content": "A view of Cedar Point from the Sky Ride. Six Flags, the park's parent company, faces an uncertain future, with attendance down and a new CEO coming. Susan Glaser, Cleveland.com\n\nSANDUSKY, Ohio \u2013 A new roller coaster won\u2019t fix what\u2019s ailing Six Flags. Neither will a last-minute plan to charge extra for haunted houses at HalloWeekends.\n\n\u201cThe whole company needs to be reimagined,\u201d said Dennis Speigel, a consultant who has studied the amusement park industry for decades.\n\nSpeigel, president of International Theme Park Services in Cincinnati, said he was alarmed by what he saw earlier this month from Six Flags, in the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings report: An attendance drop of 9%, season pass sales off 8%, revenue down $100 million and $500 million in debt.\n\n\u201cWe have not felt the aftershocks from this,\u201d said Speigel, who predicts more difficult decisions ahead for the company, which is the parent of Cedar Point, Kings Island and dozens of other amusement and water parks throughout North America.\n\nSpeigel expects as many as half or more of the company\u2019s parks to be put up for sale. And bankruptcy is not out of the question, he said.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone in his concern.\n\nJames Hardiman, an analyst with Citi Research, said he too thinks the company will need to shed parks to raise revenue and reduce debt.\n\n\u201cEverything should be on the table as we think about asset sales,\u201d said Hardiman, of Shaker Heights, who has followed the industry for decades.\n\nHe then added a caveat: Cedar Point and a handful of the company\u2019s other top parks would likely be excluded from any upcoming liquidation.\n\nAlready, the asset sale has begun.\n\nEarlier this year, even before the company\u2019s dismal second-quarter report, Six Flags announced it would sell Six Flags America, a park in suburban Maryland that is closing next month. The company is also seeking to sell land around its Kings Dominion park near Richmond, Virginia, and will shutter California\u2019s Great America near San Francisco in 2027.\n\n\u201cIf I were running the company, there are 10 to 12 parks I would keep, pay off debt and start over,\u201d said Speigel, who added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you see the company on the precipice of bankruptcy to get that debt off the books.\u201d\n\nSix Flags spokesman Gary Rhodes said the company remains confident that it can reduce debt \u201cthrough the combination of organic growth in the business and the selective divestiture of noncore assets.\u201d\n\nThe company is evaluating the rest of its portfolio for possible additional sales, he said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.\n\nBoth Hardiman and Speigel were supportive of the merger, which joined together the two largest regional amusement companies in a union of equals completed in July 2024.\n\nIn May, less than a year later, company officials painted a rosy picture of the future at an investor day presentation at Hotel Breakers in Sandusky.\n\n\u201cThey thought it was going to be a really strong quarter, with attendance up 5 or 6%,\u201d said Hardiman. Instead, attendance dropped 9%.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the biggest miss I\u2019ve ever seen in the theme park industry versus expectations,\u201d said Hardiman.\n\nIn response, two national law firms in recent weeks have announced they are soliciting clients for a possible securities-fraud class action lawsuit.\n\nRhodes declined to comment on any potential litigation.\n\nOn the same day as the second-quarter earnings report, Six Flags President and CEO Richard Zimmerman announced that he would leave his post at the end of the year.\n\nBoth Speigel and Hardiman said Zimmerman was likely forced out by the Six Flags board, although a spokesman for the company declined to say.\n\nZimmerman was the long-time CEO of Cedar Fair when the Sandusky-based company merged with Six Flags last year.\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman of the board -- Selim Bassoul, who is a former CEO of Six Flags -- has retained his job, despite this month taking on an additional position as chairman of the board of Goodfood, a meal-kit delivery company in Canada.\n\nHardiman said the timing of Zimmerman\u2019s announced departure was odd, given that it occurred in the middle of the amusement-park season.\n\nIn addition, he noted that attendance trends had improved in the weeks since the second quarter ended in June.\n\nAccording to the company, attendance was up 4% during the final four weeks of July.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a good year no matter what happens,\u201d said Hardiman. \u201cBut we might ultimately get to the end of 2025 and think it wasn\u2019t that much of a disaster. I think that is entirely possible.\u201d\n\nCarissa Baker, who heads the theme park and attraction management program at the University of Central Florida, also said Zimmerman\u2019s departure was a surprise.\n\n\u201cMergers have growing pains, there\u2019s no doubt. They were two different companies, management styles, priorities,\u201d said Baker. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that there are difficulties.\u201d\n\nStill, she said, Zimmerman\u2019s exit seems premature. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing. Who\u2019s going to take his place?\u201d\n\nZimmerman, in the earnings call, blamed weather for much of the company\u2019s troubles.\n\nBrian Witherow, chief financial officer at Six Flags, noted that 20% of second-quarter operating days were affected by bad weather. The parks were forced to close for 49 days because of extreme conditions.\n\n\u201cBy comparison, we were only forced to close parks on 12 days due to inclement weather during the 2024,\u201d Witherow said.\n\nSpeigel said weather has long been used as an excuse by amusement park executives to explain poor performance. But in the case of 2025, the weather has been particularly bad nearly everywhere in the U.S. \u2013 especially in early summer, which is an important period for season pass sales.\n\nSpeigel said Six Flags overestimated the number of people who would be enticed to buy season passes that allowed them to visit multiple parks, a perk of the newly enlarged company.\n\nHardiman also believes that perhaps Cedar Fair executives underestimated how deeply troubled the legacy Six Flags parks are.\n\n\u201cOn paper, I thought the deal made a lot of sense,\u201d said Hardiman.\n\nThe Cedar Fair philosophy, as Hardiman describes it, is that slow, steady investment yields growth. \u201cThese are assets that you need to nurture and care for,\u201d he said.\n\nSix Flags, on the other hand, has always operated more tumultuously \u2013 with four CEOs in the eight years before the merger, and a bankruptcy filing in 2009.\n\n\u201cThe Cedar Fair assets can\u2019t have changed that much in last year or so,\u201d said Hardiman. \u201cAnd there now have been three or four management teams to try to turn around the Six Flags assets. Each has struggled. The fear is that there\u2019s something irredeemable there or that it\u2019s going to require a lot more investment and/or time than anybody expected.\u201d\n\nAlready, some cutting has occurred. Earlier this year, Six Flags restructured park leadership, letting go of 27 individual park presidents in favor of a more regional management system.\n\nIn addition, parks were forced to cut 10% of their year-round workforce, which at Cedar Point equated to about 40 people.\n\nIn an effort to raise revenue, the company this fall is charging extra for haunted attractions at Cedar Point and other legacy Cedar Fair parks for the first time \u2013 a move that has angered many long-time season passholders, who said they bought the passes with the assumption that fall activities would be included.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hoping to capture some of the revenue they\u2019ve lost,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to come close.\u201d\n\nSpeigel said he thinks the merger was too quickly conceived, announced in November 2023 and finalized in July 2024.\n\n\u201cI think their due diligence on this merger was just too fast,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good idea, but a flawed business plan. They overpromised and underdelivered.\u201d\n\nHardiman noted that the company\u2019s stock price \u2013 at $23.84 on Wednesday -- was listed at less than half its value before the merger.\n\nStill, he believes it is undervalued and has it rated as a buy. \u201cIf they can get a few things right, the stock will go up,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, though, the priority has to be finding a new leader, he said.\n\n\u201cWho are they going to find who is better equipped to navigate this environment?\u201d asked Hardiman. \u201cThis industry has a lot of examples of management teams and leaders that weren\u2019t built for the job, who came from other industries. To find someone who has the experience to lead this company \u2013 I\u2019m not sure where that person is going to come from.\u201d\n\nHardiman also noted that there\u2019s no guarantee that the next leader will improve things, particularly from a consumer perspective.\n\n\u201cTo be very clear, it could be worse,\u201d said Hardiman. \u201cThis is a management team that was trying to balance investments and growth and financial responsibility. The alternative view is that you need to cut your way out of this problem.\u201d\n\nHardiman said he hopes that\u2019s not what happens.\n\n\u201cAs someone who grew up in the Northeast Ohio region, who has gone to Cedar Point I don\u2019t know how many dozen times, I don\u2019t want to see that happen to the Cedar Fair parks, which I think are really valuable assets,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would hate to see that undone.\u201d\n\nNote: 2023 attendance figures are estimates from the Themed Entertainment Association. Six Flags does not release attendance information for individual parks.\n\nFarewell, Cedar Fair: Cedar Point, Kings Island parent company is now Six Flags\n\nCedar Fair shareholders want to derail the merger with Six Flags -- but can they?",

      "text": "CHARLOTTE, North Carolina \u2013 Attendance at Six Flags parks dropped 9% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year, a disappointing start to the year that company officials attributed to lousy weather across much of the United States.\n\u201cWe prefer not to use weather as an excuse for soft performance, but rather acknowledge that it is an uncontrollable we need to navigate through,\u201d said Brian Witherow, Six Flags chief financial officer, on a conference call with analysts Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s clear, however, that extreme weather throughout much of our North America portfolio had a meaningful impact on early season operations.\u201d\nIn response to the weak first half of the year, company officials revised their financial outlook downward for 2025.\nSix Flags stock dropped 21% on Wednesday, to $24.33.\nThe earnings report Wednesday comes 13 months after the merger between Cedar Fair and Six Flags, which created the largest amusement park company in the world. The company is the parent company for Ohio\u2019s Cedar Point and Kings Island, as well as 40 other parks throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico.\nDespite a disappointing first half of the year, company executives believe the company will rebound in the last six months of 2025.\nIndeed, attendance figures from July and early August are already showing signs of recovery. Attendance for the five-week period ending Aug. 3 was up 1% compared to the same period in 2024.\n\u201cJuly has been a turning point,\u201d said Six Flags CEO and President Richard Zimmerman, who announced Wednesday that he was stepping down at the end of 2025. \u201cAs weather has normalized and guests have had a chance to experience our new rides and other attractions, we are seeing a surge in demand for our parks, while sales for season passes and memberships are climbing fast. While we know we have ground to make up from a tough May and June, these results send a clear message: When the gates are open and the product is strong, people will visit.\u201d\nCedar Point recently started selling a new $99 Gold Pass, good for unlimited admission to all Six Flags parks for the rest of 2025 and all 2026.\nRelated: Richard Zimmerman, who oversaw Six Flags-Cedar Fair merger, to step down\nAttendance in 2025 is also expected to be affected by the cancellation of several late-year events at some of the company\u2019s smaller parks.\nEarlier this summer, Six Flags announced that it was canceling fall festivals at Michigan\u2019s Adventure and Six Flags America in Maryland, as well as December events at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey and Six Flags Over Georgia.\nIn another cost-cutting move, the company is planning to sell Six Flags America in the Washington, D.C. suburbs, as well as excess land located near Kings Dominion in Virginia.\n\u201cWe are also actively evaluating other opportunities where similar value creation is possible,\u201d said Witherow."

      "text": "CHARLOTTE, North Carolina \u2013 Six Flags announced Thursday that it will close Six Flags America in suburban Washington, D.C. at the end of the 2025 operating season.\nThe park, which opened in 1974 as a wildlife park and became part of the Six Flags chain in the late 1990s, will be put up for sale and marketed for redevelopment, according to the company.\nIt\u2019s the first major operational announcement from Six Flags since the merger last year between Cedar Fair and Six Flags, into what is now the largest operator of regional amusement parks in North America.\nSix Flags also owns Ohio parks Cedar Point and Kings Island.\n\u201cThere are no plans to close other parks at this time,\u201d said company spokesman Gary Rhodes.\nRichard Zimmerman, the president and CEO of Six Flags, said he expects strong interest in the park property, which also includes Hurricane Harbor waterpark. The entire park encompasses about 500 acres in Bowie, Maryland, approximately 15 miles northeast of the nation\u2019s capital.\n\u201cAs part of our comprehensive review of our park portfolio, we have determined that Six Flags America and Hurricane Harbor are not a strategic fit with the company\u2019s long-term growth plan,\u201d said Zimmerman, in a prepared statement. \u201cAfter reviewing a number of options, we believe that marketing the property for redevelopment will generate the highest value and return on investment.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThis was a difficult decision, and we recognize the impact it will have on our Six Flags America and Hurricane Harbor park associates and guests. We are grateful to our park associates who work hard to create lifelong memories for our guests, and Six Flags is committed to supporting all impacted associates through the closure process at the end of this year.\u201d\nSix Flags America employs approximately 70 full-time associates. The park\u2019s final operating day will be Sunday, Nov. 2.\nWith the closure of Six Flags America, Six Flags will operate 26 amusement parks and 14 waterparks in 16 states, as well as Canada and Mexico."

He succeeded Matthew Ouimet, who led the company from 2012 to 2017.\nThe board has already begun a search for Zimmerman\u2019s successor.\nZimmerman, in a statement, said the industry has evolved tremendously during his decades of work.\n\u201cThe company has significantly evolved since I first joined what was then Paramount Parks, Inc. in 1987, and it has been an honor to have led such talented teams through critical and transformative periods over the years \u2013 not only for our company, but for the entire amusement park industry,\u201d said Zimmerman.\nZimmerman\u2019s announcement Wednesday coincided with the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings report. The company reported disappointing financial results, with attendance down 9% compared to the same period in 2024.\nJeff Putz, co-founder of the Cedar Point fan site Pointbuzz.com, isn\u2019t a fan of Zimmerman\u2019s leadership or the merger, which resulted in widespread layoffs at the parks earlier this year.\nRelated: Six Flags 2025 layoffs: Will Cedar Point\u2019s service standards suffer?\n\u201cThere was no upside for Cedar Fair investors, and the \u2018cost synergies\u2019 never made sense,\u201d said Putz. \u201cEven if you characterize the merger as purely transactional, the only people who might win were Six Flags investors.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThe deep layoffs resulted in a self-inflicted brain drain. They let go of people with decades of experience and went to a regional structure of micromanagement. Those folks knew their role and markets best. People are now doing the same role at three or four parks. That doesn\u2019t scale.\u201d\nHe said he hoped that Zimmerman\u2019s successor is able to \u201creverse some of the carnage.\u201d\nSelim Bassoul, the former CEO of Six Flags who now serves as executive chairman of the board, praised Zimmerman\u2019s leadership.\n\u201cOn behalf of the board, I want to thank Richard for his leadership and contributions since the successful merger of the legacy Cedar Fair and Six Flags companies last July, and for his unwavering passion and dedication to our industry over the last 38 years,\u201d said Bassoul. \u201cAs CEO, Richard has successfully led Six Flags through a period of significant evolution, with a clear vision to optimize the company to deliver greater value to our guests, associates, and our shareholders.\u201d\nZimmerman said he will serve as CEO until the board has appointed his replacement.

      "text": "SANDUSKY, Ohio \u2013 Cedar Point will charge extra for haunted houses during the park\u2019s popular HalloWeekends event this fall.\nHaunted attractions previously had been included with park admission. Starting next month, however, all indoor haunted houses, plus Cornstalkers 2.0: Revenge of the Pumpkin Heads, which is outdoors, will be accessed via a separate add-on ticket. Price of the new Haunted Attractions Pass ranges from $10 to $30, depending on the day.\nMost outdoor haunted scare zones, meanwhile, will continue to be included with general park admission, which starts at about $50 online.\nSeason passholders, too, will have to pay extra for the indoor attractions.\nPark spokesman Tony Clark said the new pass reflects an evolution of the event.\n\u201cThe Haunted Attractions Pass allows us to deliver more intense scares and better manage guest flow,\u201d he said. \u201cThis way, those who want the full terror experience can enjoy it at its peak, while other guests can still enjoy everything else the park offers.\u201d\nPark fans reacted swiftly on social media.\n\u201cHearing this news I\u2019m not bothering to visit in September,\u201d wrote one long-time visitor on Facebook. \u201cI\u2019m tired of these greedy companies,\u201d wrote another.\nHalloWeekends is Cedar Point\u2019s most popular special event, featuring a combination of the park\u2019s top lineup of rides and entertainment, plus haunted houses and outdoor scare zones. The festival, which runs Thursdays through Sundays, Sept. 11 through Nov. 2, typically draws some of the park\u2019s biggest crowds of the year.\nThe announcement comes a year after the merger between Cedar Point\u2019s parent company, Cedar Fair, and Six Flags, a rival amusement park company. The new company, with 42 amusement and water parks, is called Six Flags, although its top executives all came from Cedar Fair.\nSix Flags parks have typically charged extra for their haunted attractions during fall festivals.\nHalloWeekends this year also will feature another extra-charge attraction, \u201cThe Conjuring: Beyond Fear,\u201d an interactive experience featuring scenes from \u201cThe Conjuring Universe.\u201d It will cost an extra $15-$25, depending on the day, and is not included in the Haunted Attractions Pass.\nNot everyone reacted negatively to the news of the new fees. \u201cI hope this lowers attendance,\u201d wrote one visitor on Facebook. \u201cTrying to walk around there shoulder to shoulder wasn\u2019t worth it the last few years.\u201d\nSix Flags last week reported a disappointing second quarter, with attendance down 9% for the time period compared to a year ago. In response, company officials revised their financial outlook downward for 2025. Six Flags stock is down 22% from a week ago.\nRead more: Cedar Point parent Six Flags reports system-wide 9% attendance drop, revises 2025 financial outlook"

      "text": "SANDUSKY, Ohio \u2013 Don\u2019t expect changes overnight with the completion today of the merger between Cedar Fair and Six Flags, two amusement park giants that are now one.\nEventually, park guests at Cedar Point, Kings Island and other affected parks could see some cost savings and the sharing of rides, technology and intellectual property.\nBut for now, it\u2019s business as usual for the new Six Flags Entertainment Co., headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., with a portfolio of 27 amusement parks, 15 water parks and nine resorts across 17 states, Canada and Mexico.\nThe merger finalized at the close of business Monday.\nIn a statement, the company said it was not planning any name or branding changes at any of the parks.\n\u201cToday marks a significant milestone for our company, shareholders, guests and associates, unlocking higher value and greater opportunities to deliver engaging entertainment experiences,\u201d said Richard Zimmerman, president and chief executive officer of the new Six Flags.\nStarting Tuesday, the new company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange as FUN, which was the ticker for Cedar Fair.\nThough the name Cedar Fair goes away, former Cedar Fair executives will be running the new company, including Zimmerman, Chief Operating Officer Tim Fisher and Chief Financial Officer Brian Witherow.\nCompany headquarters will be in Charlotte, which is where many top Cedar Fair executives have worked for years. Sandusky will retain a satellite corporate office, with finance and administrative staff.\nJames Hardiman, an analyst with Citi Research, said Six Flags parks are the big winners in the deal.\nSix Flags, formerly headquartered outside Dallas, was founded in 1961; flagship parks include Six Flags Great America near Chicago, Six Flags Over Georgia near Atlanta and Six Flags Magic Mountain near Los Angeles.\nSix Flags parks generally are perceived to be not as well run as their Cedar Fair counterparts, according to industry observers.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll end up looking more like Cedar Fair parks in terms of quality and customer service and overall cleanliness,\u201d said Hardiman, who has followed the theme park industry for many years. \u201cThat\u2019s my hope.\u201d\nHardiman, who lives in Shaker Heights, said his only regret is that Sandusky is losing the corporate headquarters.\n\u201cAs a Clevelander, my only real hangup is that the headquarters is moving to Charlotte,\u201d he said.\nCedar Fair has been headquartered in Sandusky since 1983, when the company was created after Cedar Point purchased Valleyfair, a park outside Minneapolis.\nIn the decades since, the company has purchased more than a dozen other parks, including Kings Island near Cincinnati, Knott\u2019s Berry Farm in California, Canada\u2019s Wonderland in Toronto and Carowinds in North Carolina.\nWalt Schmidt, co-founder of the Cedar Point fan site Pointbuzz.com, said he didn\u2019t believe most Cedar Point fans were too concerned about the merger.\n\u201cI think most understand that with the Cedar Fair leadership team largely staying in place, the only thing that\u2019s really changing is the company name,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some nostalgia there with the Cedar Fair name, but I expect it to be business as usual for now.\u201d\nA few dozen corporate employees remain in Sandusky, according to Tom Horsman, communications manager for the city.\nHe noted that the company recently \u201cmade a significant investment in new corporate office space at the Cedar Point Sports Center complex and they have committed to keeping those corporate jobs in Sandusky.\u201d\nCedar Fair in 2023 employed approximately 3,350 full-time employees along with 49,700 part-time workers, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; Six Flags had 1,350 full-time workers with 41,000 seasonal employees.\nIndustry consultant Dennis Speigel, the founder of International Theme Park Services, said layoffs among senior level management are probably likely \u2013 one part of how the company plans to attain $200 million in so-called synergies from the merger.\nStill, he said, \u201cThis is good for amusement park goers, and for Six Flags in particular. It was on the downhill slide. Cedar Fair injection into that company is going to be huge.\u201d\nRead more:\nJustice Department signs off on Cedar Fair-Six Flags merger, amusement park officials say\nCedar Fair shareholders want to derail the merger with Six Flags -- but can they?\nWhat to know about the Cedar Fair-Six Flags merger, from Batman rides to possible name changes\nIs Cedar Fair slowly moving its headquarters away from Sandusky?

  "argos_summary": "Six Flags, now the merged entity with Cedar Fair, reported a 9% drop in Q2 attendance and a $100\u202fmillion revenue decline, prompting a downward 2025 outlook and the announcement that CEO Richard Zimmerman will step down. Analysts warn that the company may need to divest half its parks and could face bankruptcy, with current asset sales already underway (e.g., Six Flags America). Weather has been cited as a major factor, but executives insist the company will rebound in the second half of the year. The merger, completed in July 2024, has sparked shareholder opposition and a potential securities\u2011fraud lawsuit, while the company seeks new leadership and cost\u2011cutting measures.",
