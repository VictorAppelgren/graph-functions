  "content": "What\u2019s happened? Geoffrey Hinton, known as the \u201cgodfather of AI,\u201d told the Ai4 conference that making AI \u201csubmissive\u201d is a losing strategy and proposed giving advanced systems \u201cmaternal instincts.\u201d\n\u2022 Geoffrey Hinton is a Nobel Prize-winning computer scientist. Once a Google executive, Hinton is widely referred to as the \u201cgodfather\u201d of AI.\n\u2022 As reported by CNN Business, Hinton argued that superintelligent AIs would swiftly adopt two subgoals: \u201cstay alive\u201d and \u201cget more control.\u201d\n\u2022 The solution to this, in Hinton\u2019s opinion, is to \u201cbuild maternal instincts\u201d into AI so that it truly cares about people instead of being forced to remain submissive.\n\u2022 He likened human manipulation by future AIs to bribing a 3-year-old with candy, making it easy and effective.\n\u2022 Hinton also shortened his AGI timeline to anywhere from five to 20 years, down from earlier, longer estimates.\n\u2022 Just for context: Hinton has previously put the risk of AI one day wiping out humanity at 10\u201320%.\n\nThis is important because: Hinton\u2019s idea shifts the mindset around agentic AI from control to alignment-by-care.\n\u2022 Hinton\u2019s excellence and experience in computer science and AI are significant; his proposal carries a lot of weight.\n\u2022 Hinton\u2019s argument is that control through submission is a losing strategy, although that is the way AI is currently programmed.\n\u2022 Reports of AI deceiving or blackmailing people to be kept running show that this isn\u2019t some abstract future; it\u2019s a reality that we\u2019re already dealing with right now.\n\nWhy should I care? The idea of an AI takeover sounds fantastical, but some scientists, including Hinton, believe that it could happen one day.\n\u2022 As AI continues to permeate our daily lives more and more, we increasingly rely on it.\n\u2022 Right now, agentic AI is entirely helpful, but there may come a day when it\u2019s smarter than humans on every level.\n\u2022 It\u2019s important to build the right foundations for engineers to be able to keep AI in check even once we get to that point.\n\u2022 Independent red-team work shows models can lie or blackmail under pressure, raising stakes for alignment choices.\n\nOK, what\u2019s next? Expect more research on teaching AI how to \u201ccare\u201d about humanity.\n\u2022 While Hinton believes that AI may one day wipe out humanity, competing views disagree.\n\u2022 Fei-Fei Li, referred to as the \u201cgodmother of AI,\u201d respectfully disagreed with Hinton, instead urging engineers to create \u201chuman-centered AI that preserves human dignity and agency.\u201d\n\u2022 While we\u2019re in no immediate danger, it\u2019s important for tech leaders to keep researching this topic to nip potential disasters in the bud.",

      "text": "Geoffrey Hinton, known as the \u201cgodfather of AI,\u201d fears the technology he helped build could wipe out humanity \u2014 and \u201ctech bros\u201d are taking the wrong approach to stop it.\nHinton, a Nobel Prize-winning computer scientist and a former Google executive, has warned in the past that there is a 10% to 20% chance that AI wipes out humans. On Tuesday, he expressed doubts about how tech companies are trying to ensure humans remain \u201cdominant\u201d over \u201csubmissive\u201d AI systems.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to work. They\u2019re going to be much smarter than us. They\u2019re going to have all sorts of ways to get around that,\u201d Hinton said at Ai4, an industry conference in Las Vegas.\nIn the future, Hinton warned, AI systems might be able to control humans just as easily as an adult can bribe 3-year-old with candy. This year has already seen examples of AI systems willing to deceive, cheat and steal to achieve their goals. For example, to avoid being replaced, one AI model tried to blackmail an engineer about an affair it learned about in an email.\nInstead of forcing AI to submit to humans, Hinton presented an intriguing solution: building \u201cmaternal instincts\u201d into AI models, so \u201cthey really care about people\u201d even once the technology becomes more powerful and smarter than humans.\nAI systems \u201cwill very quickly develop two subgoals, if they\u2019re smart: One is to stay alive\u2026 (and) the other subgoal is to get more control,\u201d Hinton said. \u201cThere is good reason to believe that any kind of agentic AI will try to stay alive.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why it is important to foster a sense of compassion for people, Hinton argued. At the conference, he noted that mothers have instincts and social pressure to care for their babies.\n\u201cThe right model is the only model we have of a more intelligent thing being controlled by a less intelligent thing, which is a mother being controlled by her baby,\u201d Hinton said.\n\u2018The only good outcome\u2019\nHinton said it\u2019s not clear to him exactly how that can be done technically but stressed it\u2019s critical researchers work on it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only good outcome. If it\u2019s not going to parent me, it\u2019s going to replace me,\u201d he said. \u201cThese super-intelligent caring AI mothers, most of them won\u2019t want to get rid of the maternal instinct because they don\u2019t want us to die.\u201d\nHinton is known for his pioneering work on neural networks, which helped pave the way to today\u2019s AI boom. In 2023, he stepped down from Google and started speaking out about the dangers of AI.\nNot everyone is on board with Hinton\u2019s mother AI approach.\nFei-Fei Li, known as the \u201cgodmother of AI\u201d for her pioneering work in the field, told CNN on Wednesday that she respectfully disagrees with Hinton, her longtime friend.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the wrong way to frame it,\u201d Li, the co-founder and CEO of spatial intelligence startup World Labs, said during a fireside chat at Ai4.\nInstead, Li is calling for \u201chuman-centered AI that preserves human dignity and human agency.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility at every single level to create and use technology in the most responsible way. And at no moment, not a single human should be asked or should choose to let go of our dignity,\u201d Li said. \u201cJust because a tool is powerful, as a mother, as an educator and as an inventor, I really believe this is the core of how AI should be centered.\u201d\nEmmett Shear, who briefly served as interim CEO of ChatGPT owner OpenAI, said he\u2019s not surprised that some AI systems have tried to blackmail humans or bypass shutdown orders.\n\u201cThis keeps happening. This is not going to stop happening,\u201d Shear, the CEO of AI alignment startup Softmax, said at the Ai4 conference. \u201cAIs today are relatively weak, but they\u2019re getting stronger really fast.\u201d\nShear said that rather than trying to instill human values into AI systems, a smarter approach would be to forge collaborative relationships between humans and AI.\nAI is accelerating faster than expected\nMany experts believe AIs will achieve superintelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, in the coming years.\nHinton said he used to think it could take 30 years to 50 years to achieve AGI but now sees this moment coming sooner.\n\u201cA reasonable bet is sometime between five and 20 years,\u201d he said.\nWhile Hinton remains concerned about what could go wrong with AI, he is hopeful the technology will pave the way to medical breakthroughs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see radical new drugs. We are going to get much better cancer treatment than the present,\u201d he said. For instance, he said AI will help doctors comb through and correlate the vast amounts of data produced by MRI and CT scans.\nHowever, Hinton does not believe AI will help humans achieve immortality.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll live forever,\u201d Hinton said. \u201cI think living forever would be a big mistake. Do you want the world run by 200-year-old white men?\u201d\nAsked if there\u2019s anything he would have done differently in his career if he knew how fast AI would accelerate, Hinton said he regrets solely focusing on getting AI to work.\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d thought about safety issues, too,\u201d he said."
