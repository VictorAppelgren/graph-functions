  "content": "We recently published 10 Big Names With Surprising Gains. Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) is one of Wednesday\u2019s best performers.\n\nFutu Holdings snapped a four-day losing streak on Wednesday, jumping 6.01 percent to close at $178.66 apiece as investors cheered the company\u2019s stellar earnings performance in the second quarter of the year.\n\nIn an updated report, Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) said net income more than doubled to HK$2.57 billion from HK$1.21 billion in the same period last year. Revenues grew by 69 percent to HK$5.3 billion from HK$3.13 billion year-on-year, on the back of higher brokerage commission and handling charge income, as well as increased interest income.\n\nIn the first half, net income more than doubled to HK$4.7 billion from HK$2.24 billion, while revenues increased by 75 percent to HK$10 billion from HK$5.7 billion year-on-year.\n\n\u201cTrade policy-induced market volatility, coupled with a slate of high-profile IPOs, boosted retail sentiment in Hong Kong, which, for the third quarter in a row, contributed the highest number of new funded accounts across all markets. The US market also recorded solid growth. In the second quarter, we became the official sponsor of the New York Mets, further elevating our brand image in the US and beyond. We also launched crypto trading in most of the states in June, strengthening our value proposition as a one-stop trading platform,\u201d said Futu Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:FUTU) Chairman and CEO Leaf Hua Li.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of FUTU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an extremely cheap AI stock that is also a major beneficiary of Trump tariffs and onshoring, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.",

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes.

But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy?
