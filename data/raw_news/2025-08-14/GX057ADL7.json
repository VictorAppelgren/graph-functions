  "content": "LIZZY: THIS IS HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA. DEEP CUTS. SCOTT BESSENT WAS MARKET EXPECTATIONS FOR FAILING EASING, TELLING BLOOMBERG IT IS TIME FOR A SERIES OF CUTS STARTING WITH 50 BASIS POINTS NEXT MONTH. PRESIDENT TRUMP WARNS VLADIMIR PUTIN HE WOULD FACE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES IF THE RUSSIAN LEADER DOESN'T AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE TOMORROW. TENCENT SHARES CLIMBED AFTER CHINA'S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY BEAT ESTIMATES IN ALL REPORTING SEGMENTS. 8:00 A.M. ACROSS THE MERITS, 5:00 IN LONDON. GOOD MORNING TO YOU AND WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. SEEMS LIKE AUGUST HAS ARRIVED. IF YOU LOOK AT CURRENCIES AND BONDS AND STOCKS, VOLATILITY AT ITS LOWEST LEVELS THIS YEAR. YOU COULD SEE THAT IN FUTURES AND EQUITIES. PRETTY RANGE BOUND, RED ACROSS THE SCREEN AS WE LOOK TO THE ASIA SESSION, ALREADY STARTING IN NEGATIVE TERRITORY BUT IN YOUR CROSS ASSET PICTURE THE 10 YEAR YIELD, 4.2 THREE, EURO-DOLLAR ONE POINT 17, OUR INTERVIEW WITH SCOTT BESSENT WEIGHING ON THE DOLLAR AND YIELDS. SENDING BITCOIN TO RECORD LEVELS, MARCHING EVEN HIGHER THIS MORNING AND YOU HAVE GOLD HIGHER AS WELL. NOT JUST BECAUSE OF BESSENT'S PUSH FOR LOWER RATES BUT AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO THE TRUMP-PUTIN SUMMIT AHEAD IN ALASKA TOMORROW. MINMIN LOW IS IN HONG KONG WITH A LOOK AT ASIAN MARKET. LOOKS LIKE RIGHT ACROSS THE SCREEN WHERE YOU ARE. THERE IS RED. MINMIN: A GOOD WEEK SO FAR. A BIT OF PROFIT TAKING BUT LED BY 1.5% BECAUSE OF THE BIG MOVIE IN THE YEN, TREATING 146.55, DOWN ABOUT 0.5% ON USD-JPY, THE YEN AT ITS STRONGEST LEVEL IN WEEKS AFTER SCOTT BESSENT SAID THE BOJ HAS BEEN BEHIND THE CURVE DRESSING IN ELATION AND HIKING RATES. THAT HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE EXPORT HEAVY NIKKEI 225. THE TAIEX WAS FLOODED WITH RECORD HIGHS YESTERDAY BUT PULLING BACK TODAY BY 0.0%. CHINA SHOWING A DIFFERENT PICTURE, STOCK TURNOVER IN CHINA TOPPING 2 TRILLION YUAN, A LEVEL WE HAVE SEEN AROUND THE DEEPSEEK MOMENTS OF INTEREST COMING INTO THE CHINESE MARKET RECENTLY, PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THE EARNINGS SEASON. LOOKING PRETTY STRONG, TENCENT REPORTING YESTERDAY, ABOUT 1.3%, STRONG EARNINGS IN THE SECOND QUARTER, BEATING ESTIMATES. THAT IS DESPITE THE CREDIT DATA FROM THE PBOC YESTERDAY SHOWING A CONTRACTION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY TWO DECADES. HOUSEHOLDS AND CORPORATE FOCUSING ON PAYING BACK LOANS RATHER THAN TAKING OUT NEW LOANS AND THAT TELLS YOU ABOUT CONSUMER SENTIMENT IN CHINA. LIZZY: LOOKING FORWARD TO DIVING INTO TENCENT EARNINGS LATER. WE WILL SEE WINNOWED BIT. -- SEE YOU IN A BIT. WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW AND MARKET MOVING, SCOTT BESSENT URGING THE FED TO CUT INTEREST RATES BY 150 BASIS POINTS OR MORE. > > WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE 150, 1 HUNDRED 75 BASIS POINTS LOWER, SO I THINK THE COMMITTEE NEEDS TO STEP BACK. I THINK PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST POLITICIZED GOVERNORS JUST WENT OFF THE BOARD. LIZZY: FOR MORE ON HOW THE CURRENCY MARKETS ARE REACTING, LET'S SPEAK TO THE HEAD OF FX RESEARCH AT ANZ. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. LET'S START WITH THE COMMENTS ON THE FED. WE HAVE TRADERS PRICING FULLY A SEPTEMBER CUT. THAT IS WHY A QUARTER-POINT EVEN IF BESSENT WANTS 50. WE WONDER IF WE ARE UNDERESTIMATING HOW MUCH OF A WEAKER DOLLAR THERE COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL PRESSURE ON THE FED TO CUT. MAHJABEEN: IT IS SURPRISING TO HEAR THAT FROM THE TREASURY SECRETARY, LOOKING TO SIGNAL SUCH A DEEP CUT. A CUT LIKE THAT WOULD TAKE FED RATES TO SOMETHING LIKE 275 OR SOMETHING. THOSE RATES WHEN INFLATION IS ABOVE 3.7 -- 3%, WE KNOW WHY THE INTEREST RATE -- THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO LOWER INTEREST RATES AND THAT IS TO BRING LONGER YIELDS LOWER, BRING THE COST OF DEBT LOAN WHICH MAKES SENSE BUT THE REALITY IS, BETWEEN NOW AND SEPTEMBER'S MEETING, WE WILL SEE A PUSH AND PULL OF MARKET EXPECTATIONS BETWEEN 25 BASIS POINTS, WHICH IS PRICED IN, AND THESE HEADLINES INCHING TOWARDS 50. LIZZY: TO COMPILE YOUR DOLLAR OUTLOOK, IS IT ALL ABOUT HEADLINES OVER DATA? MAHJABEEN: IT IS BOTH. WITH THE DATA, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WE ARE WAITING FOR THE NEXT CPI AND JOBS DATA TO SEE HOW SOFT THE LABOR MARKET IS, AS IT WAS IN THE LAST AND IF P. INTERESTINGLY, THE U.S. ECONOMIC SURPRISES, ALTHOUGH WE ARE SEEING THE JOBS DATA IS NEGATIVE, OTHER INDICATIONS SEEM TO BE OK. WE ARE CALLING FOR A WEAKER DOLLAR BUT NOT A CRASH. I THINK THE LARGE MOVE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. LIZZY: DO YOU THINK HAVING A LONGER CANDIDATE LIST FOR THE NEXT FED CHAIR IS NECESSARILY GOING TO MAKE THE FY MC MORE DOVISH OR IF THE DOVISHNESS COMES, WILL THAT BE AFTER POWELL LEAVES AS CHAIR? MAHJABEEN: I THINK WE SAW THE HEADLINE THAT I THINK TRUMP CAME OUT TO SAY HE MIGHT ANNOUNCE THE NEXT CHAIR A LITTLE EARLIER. THAT WILL WEIGH ON EXPECTATIONS. THERE ARE A HOST OF NAMES OUT THERE. WE KNOW WALLER, BOWMAN, THEY ARE DOVISH. IF THEY COME THROUGH AND THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON MARKET PRICING, ANOTHER CANDIDATE, ALL OF THESE ARE LEANING DOVISH, THESE CANDIDATES AND THE OTHER BASKET, A COUPLE NAMES WHO HAVE COME UP, JAMES BULLARD, KEVIN WASH, THEY HAVE WRITTEN A COUPLE TIMES ABOUT FED INDEPENDENCE. THEY WOULD BE MORE ALONG THE NEUTRAL SITE SO IT DEPENDS. LIZZY: I WONDER IF BEING ON THE LIST WILL TEMPT MORE HAWKISH NAMES TO SOUND AND VOTE MORE DOVISH. IT WASN'T JUST THE FED BESSENT WAS TALKING ABOUT. HE TOUCHED ON THE BANK OF JAPAN. > > THE JAPANESE HAVE AN INFLATION PROBLEM. MY OPINION, NOT THE GOVERNORS, THEY ARE BEHIND THE HEART -- THE CURVE AND THEY WILL BE HIKING. THEY NEED TO GET INFLATION UNDER CONTROL. LIZZY: YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE YEN'S VULNERABILITY. IS THAT TREASURY SECRETARY HELPING THE YEN ON MULTIPLE FRONTS? MAHJABEEN: THOSE COMMENTS IF YOU LOOK AT MARKET PRICING RIGHT NOW, WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT WE DO THINK THE BANK OF JAPAN WILL BE HIKING POTENTIALLY IN OCTOBER BUT A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON THE GROWTH OUTLOOK. WE ARE GETTING Q2 GDP DATA TOMORROW AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER JAPAN HAS EFFECTIVELY ESCAPED THE TECHNICAL RECESSION AFTER THE LAST DATA, WHICH WAS UNDERWATER. YOU CAN'T RAISE INTEREST RATES IF GROWTH IS AT RISK. THE TARIFF RISK IS OUT OF THE WAY, AND BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE INVESTING, AND IT PAINTS A POSITIVE PICTURE, A RECOVERY IN JAPAN. SO WE EXPECT HIKES AHEAD WHICH SHOULD HELP THE YEN. BUT IT IS WAIT AND SEE. THE JAPANESE YEN IS A FOLK -- A FUNCTIONAL YIELD. LIZZY: IN THE U.K. WE WILL GET THE LATEST GDP NUMBERS AT 7:00 A.M. LONDON TIME, THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL UNDERSCORE THE STAG IN STAGFLATION. HOW MUCH WILL THAT WAY ON STERLING AGAINST THE EURO IF WE STRIP OUT THE DOLLAR STORY? MAHJABEEN: I THINK SO FAR WE HAVE SEEN THE STERLING OUTPERFORM SINCE THE LAST BOE MEETING BECAUSE IT WAS ON THE HAWKISH SIDE. FUNDAMENTALLY, THE DATA IS WEAK IN THE U.K. AGAINST THE ENVIRONMENT. SERVICES INFLATION IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO WATCH IN THE U.K.. OVERALL, WE ARE QUITE NEGATIVE ON THE STERLING. RELATIVE TO THE EURO. THE EURO HAS A LOT OF THINGS GOING FOR IT RIGHT NOW. I THINK THE MOVEMENT WILL CONTINUE SO THE EURO SHOULD OUTPERFORM STERLING GOING FORWARD. MAHJABEEN: LIZZY: WE WILL HAVE COVERAGE ON THE NUMBERS 7:00 A.M. LONDON TIME BUT SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU. COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM, TALKING TOUGH. PRESIDENT TRUMP WARNS PUTIN HE EXPECTS RESULTS FROM THE HISTORIC SUMMIT TOMORROW. A PREVIEW, NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a LIZZY: WELCOME BACK TO HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA. TWO GEOPOLITICS, PRESIDENT TRUMP WARNED RUSSIA IT WILL FACE CONSEQUENCES IF PUTIN DOESN'T AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE WITH UKRAINE IN THE COMING DAYS. > > YES THEY WILL. THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES. I DON'T HAVE TO SAY, THERE WILL BE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. LIZZY: EUROPEAN LEADERS STRESSED TO TRUMP THAT YOU CREAM NEEDS -- UKRAINE NEEDS ROBUST SECURITY ASSURANCES TO MAKE SURE A DEAL. STUART JOINS US NOW. WOULD RUSSIA REALLY AGREED TO A CEASE-FIRE UNLESS UKRAINE HANDS OVER TERRITORY, WHICH ZELENSKYY HAS RULED OUT? > > GOOD MORNING. THAT IS THE KEY QUESTION. I THINK THE ASSUMPTION IS IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO SELL A DEAL THAT HAS NO TERRITORY INVOLVED TO HIS OWN GOVERNMENT. HE WENT INTO THIS SAYING IT WAS AN EXISTENTIAL QUESTION FOR THE FUTURE OF RUSSIA AND COMES OUT OF IT WITH NO TERRITORY GAINED, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY THE COST IN ECONOMIC AND HUMAN LIFE THAT THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. MIGHT THERE BE SOME PERMUTATION AROUND SECURITY GUARANTEES, THAT UKRAINE WILL NEVER BE PART OF NATO, THAT HE COULD SELL AS A VICTORY? SEEMS LIKE A LONG SHOT. LIZZY: WE HAD THE TRUMP CALL WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS. DO I DETECT A DISPARITY BETWEEN THE READOUTS FROM BOTH SIDES IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS IF PUTIN DOESN'T AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE TOMORROW? IS THERE A SENSE THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENT OUTCOME IN THEIR MINDS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO A FOLLOW-UP MEETING WITH TRUMP, PUTIN AND ZELENSKYY? STUART: YOU ARE RIGHT, THERE IS AN ELEMENT TO THAT BUT IT IS HARD TO PARSE OUT TRUMP'S POSITION BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO HAVE SHIFTED IN THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. IT STARTED WITH THE THREAT OF SANCTIONS, OR HARDER SANCTIONS, THEN BECAME SOFTER AND AFTER THIS CALL TO EU LEADERS THE CLIP YOU PLAYED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEGMENT, HE IS BACK TO TALKING ABOUT SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. WHAT WE WILL HAVE TO DO IS WAIT AND SEE AT THE SUMMIT, GET THE READ OUT FROM THAT AND SEE WHAT TRUMP'S POSITION IS BUT IN TERMS OF THE EU POSITION, THAT HAS BEEN FIRM FROM DAY ONE. NO ONE SHOULD BE MAKING CONCESSIONS ON BEHALF OF UKRAINE, AND FUNDAMENTALLY YOU NEED SECURITY GUARANTEES THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO REPEAT ITSELF BECAUSE THAT IS UKRAINE'S BIG CONCERN, THAT THEY CEDE TERRITORY AND THAT BECOMES A LAUNCHING PAD FOR THE NEXT OFFENSIVE. LIZZY: THANK YOU, STUART, FOR THE ANALYSIS. TRADERS ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE SUMMIT AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO IT. LOOKING AT THE OIL MARKETS, BRENT AND NEW YORK CRUDE FUTURES UP IN THE GREEN. LOOKING AT IT BEING STEADY AROUND A TWO MONTH LOW AND THIS IS AS WE HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY HAVING SAID THE MARKET IS ON TRACK FOR RECORD OVERSUPPLY NEXT YEAR. YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THIS WITH THE EXPECTATION THE SUMMIT COULD RESULT IN AN EASING OR TIGHTENING OF WASHINGTON SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA. WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHAT THOSE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE. LET'S GET TO OTHER TOP STORIES WE ARE FOLLOWING THIS MORNING, LEADERS FROM FRANCE, GERMANY AND THE U.K. THREATENING TO REIMPOSE YOU AND SANCTIONS ON IRAN IF A NUCLEAR DEAL IS NOT REACHED BY THE END OF THE MONTH. THEY SAY THEY ARE PREPARED TO TRIGGER WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS THE SNAPBACK MECHANISM TO REINSTATE INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS ON IRAN WHICH WERE LIFTED UNDER THE 2015 JOINT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION. SOUTH SUDAN'S GOVERNMENT DENIED REPORTS IT IS IN TALKS WITH ISRAEL ABOUT RELOCATING PALESTINIANS FROM THE GAZA STRIP TO THE NATION. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTS THE NATIONS ARE DISCUSSING RESETTLEMENT AS PART OF A WIDER EFFORT BY ISRAEL TO FACILITATE MASS IMMIGRATION, EMIGRATION FROM THE ENCLAVE. SOUTH SUDAN'S MINISTRY DESCRIBED THE CLAIMS AS BASELESS. COMING UP, TENCENT SHARES ARE RISING IN HONG KONG AFTER THE FIRM REPORTED FASTER THAN ANTICIPATED GROWTH ACROSS GAMING AND ADVERTISING. WE WILL HAVE THE DETAILS, NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. LIZZY: LEARNED APPLE IS PLANNING ITS AI COME BACK WITH AN AMBITIOUS SLATE OF NEW DEVICES INCLUDING SMART SPEAKERS WITH SCREENS AND HOME SECURITY CAMERAS. SOURCES SAY AT THE CENTER OF THE STRATEGY IS A TABLETOP ROBOT THAT SERVES AS A VIRTUAL COMPANION. IT IS SLATED FOR 2027, PART OF AN EFFORT TO RESTORE APPLE'S INNOVATION REPUTATION AFTER CRITICISM THE FIRM MISSED THE GENERATIVE AI REVOLUTION. STAYING WITH TECH, TENCENT SHARES GAINED AFTER THE CHINESE INTERNET GIANT BEAT ESTIMATES IN ALL REPORTING SEGMENTS. SALES GROWING AT THE FASTEST PACE IN FOUR YEARS. WE WILL DIVE INTO THE EARNINGS WITHOUT CHINA CORRESPONDENT -- WITH OUR CHINA CORRESPONDENT MINMIN LOW. WHY IS TENCENT PROMISING PRUDENCE ON A SPENDING WHEN WE HAVE SEEN BEATS ACROSS THE BOARD? MINMIN: THE MONETIZATION OF AI IN CHINA REMAINS VERY CHALLENGED BECAUSE CONSUMERS DON'T HAVE THE HABIT OF PAYING FOR AI TOOLS AT THE MOMENT. IMAGINE IF DEEPSEEK STARTED CHARGING. MANY CONSUMERS WOULD DELETE THE APP AND DOWNLOAD ANOTHER NEW ONE BECAUSE THE SECTOR IS COMPETITIVE. TENCENT'S PRESIDENT SAYS THEY ARE NOT PLANNING TO HIRE AGGRESSIVELY OR SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON MARKETING FOR THE SECTOR, WHICH HAS A LOT OF UNREALIZED POTENTIAL BUT DOESN'T MEAN THEY AREN'T SPENDING. THEY INCREASED AI SPENDING BY 150% IN THE SECOND QUARTER. WE KNOW TENCENT'S FOCUS IS NOT SO MUCH ROLLING OUT NEW AI PLATFORMS, BUT INTEGRATING EXISTING, INTEGRATING AI INTO EXISTING SERVICES AND IT HAS SEEN GOOD RESULTS ESPECIALLY WITH ADVERTISING. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE THE CLICK THROUGH RATES AND TARGETING AND THAT HELPS BOLSTER THE ADVERTISING REVENUE. THEY ARE OFFERING AI SERVICES FOR GAME DESIGNERS TO HELP THEM CREATE IN GAME AVATARS OR IN GAME ASSETS, FINDING WAYS TO MONETIZE AND HOPEFULLY GET THE EXISTING CAP TO BECOME A PLATFORM FOR AI AGENT TOOLS IN THE FUTURE. LIZZY: WALK US THROUGH WHAT TO EXPECT FROM JD.COM EARNINGS LATER ON. MINMIN: JD.COM, LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT PICTURE BECAUSE TENCENT, WE SAW A BEAT ON EARNINGS BUT JD.COM, ANALYSTS EXPECT A HIT TO PROFITS BECAUSE OF THEIR FORAY INTO THE FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM. IT IS A NEWCOMER IN A SECTOR DOMINATED BY OTHERS LIKE ALIBABA. IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, WE HAVE SEEN INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION, TALKING ABOUT ALMOST FREE MILK TEA, SO MONEY BEING PUMPED INTO PROMOTIONS AND INVESTMENTS INTO NEW INITIATIVES. WE ARE LOOKING AT CUTS TO OUTLOOK ON ITS ON-DEMAND DELIVERY BY AS MUCH AS 90%. WE ARE SEEING PROFIT CUTS TO OUTLOOK ACROSS THE SECTOR BUT PARTICULARLY JD.COM BECAUSE IT IS A NEW PLAYER, BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES COMING THROUGH FOR EQUIPMENT UPGRADE PROGRAMS, NEW ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SUBSIDIES FOR CONSUMER LOANS, SO THAT COULD LIFT ITS REVENUE FOR RETAIL SALES AND MAYBE OFFER A BIT OF RELIEF FROM THE PROFIT CUTS IT HAS SEEN BECAUSE OF ITS EXPENDITURE INTO ITS INVESTMENT IN THE FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM. LIZZY: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF AGGRESSIVE DISCOUNTING FROM MEITUAN TO IMPACT A DELIVERY COMPANY IN THE MIDDLE EAST THIS WEEK. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING US THAT ANALYSIS AND PREVIEW OF THOSE EARNINGS, WHICH WE WILL WATCH LATER. STAYING WITH TECH, NVIDIA AND AMD SECURED WASHINGTON'S APPROVAL TO RESUME LOWER END AI CHIP SALES TO CHINA. ON THIS CONTROVERSIAL AND LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE CONDITION THEY GIVE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT A 15% CUT OF RELATED REVENUE. THIS CAME UP IN OUR INTERVIEW WITH SCOTT BESSENT AND HE TOLD US PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME UP WITH THE IDEA AND COULD SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHERS IN THE FUTURE. > > THE PRESIDENT IS ONE OF THE MOST OPEN-MINDED PEOPLE I KNOW. HE DOES EVERYTHING ON FIRST PRINCIPLES. WHY DID WE DO THINGS THIS WAY? WHY SHOULDN'T WE DO WITH THE OTHER WAY? THIS IS A UNIQUE SOLUTION, ALLOWS NVIDIA TO EXPAND INTO CHINA. IT CAN MAKE NVIDIA CHIPS THE BELLWETHER FOR CHINESE TECHNOLOGY AND THEN, THE U.S. TAXPAYER GETS A SHARE OF THAT. > > KEYWORD IS UNIQUE. IT IS -- IS THIS YOU NEED TO NVIDIA OR A MODEL FOR OTHER COMPANIES? > > WE COULD SEE IT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES OVER TIME. RIGHT NOW, THIS IS UNIQUE BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE THE MODEL AND THE BETA TEST, WHY NOT EXPAND? > > WHAT YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO SAY WE ARE PUTTING A PRICE ON NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS BY SELLING EXPORT LICENSES? > > THERE ARE NO NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS. WE WOULD NOT SELL ANY OF THE ADVANCED CHIPS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WOULD SAY THESE ARE 4, 5, 6 LEVELS DOWN THE CHIP STACK BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS FOR HUAWEI TO HAVE A DIGITAL BELT. WE DO NOT WANT THE STANDARD TO BECOME CHINESE ACROSS THE WORLD OR EVEN IN CHINA. > > WE HAVE EXCLUSIVE REPORTING BEIJING IS SENDING LETTERS TO FIRMS SAYING, SHRUG OFF THOSE H20 AND USE OUR DOMESTIC CHAMPIONS. IS THIS SOMETHING YOU MIGHT DISCUSS? > > WE CAN DISCUSS THAT BUT IT TELLS ME THAT THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT NVIDIA CHIPS BECOMING THE STANDARD IN CHINA. NVIDIA IS AN INCREDIBLE PRODUCT. A LOT OF THE TECHNOLOGY IN CHINA IS PIGGYBACKING, I WILL USE THAT AS A KIND WORD FOR ACQUIRING, OUR TECHNOLOGY. > > YOU MEAN STEALING? > > YOUR WORDS THAT IS WHAT I MEAN. NVIDIA, JENSEN HUANG STAYS YEARS AHEAD OF THEM. > > CRITICISM CAME FROM THE WASHINGTON JOURNAL EDITORIAL BOARD ABOUT THIS NEW UNIQUE POLICY. THEY SAY IT IS A STEP TOWARDS GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF PRIVATE BUSINESS. ARE YOU CONCERNED, SOME OF THESE ARE LOOKING LIKE THE COUNTRY WERE TRYING TO DE-RISK FROM. CENTRAL PLANNING OUT OF THE OVAL. > > NOT AT ALL. WHERE WE GOT WAS, WITH THIS UNFETTERED TRADE, WE DIDN'T HAVE SECURE TRADE OR FAIR TRADE. SO NOW, WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT SECURE. ARE NOT SENDING OUT THE HIGHEST LEVEL CHIPS. WE DON'T WANT TO SELL EVERYTHING TO EVERYBODY. SO THERE IS A NEED FOR INTERVENTION. LIZZY: STEALING, ACQUIRING, POTATO, POTATO. THAT IS SCOTT BESSENT SPEAKING TO BLOOMBERG. A BIG IMPACT ON THE MARKETS AT THE BACK OF THE INTERVIEW, YOU SAW YIELDS AND THE DOLLAR DROPPING ON THE TREASURY SECRETARY'S PUSH FOR CUTS. STOP TAKING A BREATHER FROM THE RALLY. FUTURES POINTING LOWER ACROSS BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC. COMING UP, THE U.S. CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGAL MINING IN EASTERN CONGO. WE'LL GO TO AFRICA NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a LIZZY: THIS IS HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA. OUR TOP STORIES. TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT FEELS EXPECTATIONS FOR FED EASING, SAYING IT IS TIME FOR A SERIES OF CUTS STARTING WITH THE BASIS POINTS NEXT MONTH. TALKING TOUGH, PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS VLADIMIR PUTIN WARNS -- SAYS HE WILL FACE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RUSSIAN LEADER DOESN'T AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE. WE SPEAK TO THE CFO OF O Q EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AFTER THE COMPANY DELIVERED ROBUST FINANCIAL RESULTS, DESPITE MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES. 8:30 ACROSS THE EMIRATES, 5:30 IN LONDON. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. LOOKING AT THE FUTURES AND EQUITIES PICTURE, PRETTY RANGE BOUND THIS MORNING, TREADING WATER AFTER THE RALLY SO TAKING A BIT OF A BREATHER BUT IT FEELS VERY AUGUST. WE HAVE STOCKS, BONDS AND CURRENCIES AT THEIR LOWEST VOLATILITY SO FAR THIS YEAR. SEEMS CALM DESPITE THE RISKS FLOATING AROUND IN THE BACKGROUND. FLIP THE BOARD TO THE CROSS ASSET PICTURE AND WE HAVE HAD THE IMPACT OF THE INTERVIEW WITH THE TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT. THE DOLLAR AND YIELDS DROPPING COME OF THE 10 YEAR 4.23, EURO-DOLLAR 1.17 AND BITCOIN HITTING A RECORD YESTERDAY AND CONTINUING TO MARCH HIGHER, UP 0.3%, GOLD HIGHER AS WELL OFF A PUSH FOR FED CUTS, 50 BASIS POINT CUTS IS WITH THE TREASURY SECRETARY WOULD LIKE TO SEE. BUT ALSO, GOLD, MINDING THE SUMMIT BETWEEN TRUMP AND PUTIN. WE WILL HAVE COVERAGE OF THAT OUT OF ALASKA. LET'S DIVE INTO THE ASIAN MARKET MOVEMENTS. MINMIN LOW IS ON STANDBY IN HONG KONG. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING? MINMIN: IT IS A SEA OF RED IN ASIA ACROSS MOST OF THE REGIONAL BENCHMARKS. JAPAN, KOREA, TAIWAN, EXCEPT FOR ONSHORE CHINA WHICH IS DOING WELL BUT I WANT TO LOOK AT THE YEN BECAUSE WE ARE STRENGTHENING BY 0.6%, THE STRONGEST LEVEL WE HAVE SEEN IN A COUPLE WEEKS. THAT IS AFTER SCOTT BESSENT MADE A COMMENT ABOUT HOW THE BOJ IS FALLING BEHIND THE CURVE WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING INFLATION AND HIKING RATES. YOU SAW THIS DECLINE IN THE USD-JPY AND THAT HAS DRAGGED DOWN THE TECH HEAVY NIKKEI 225 INDEX. I THINK IT WAS DOWN ABOUT 1% PLUS OR SO. TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE ARE DOING IN CHINA. EARNINGS SEASON IS HAPPENING NOW. WE HAVE TENCENT REPORTING YESTERDAY, SOLID RESULTS IN THE SECOND ORDER, THE FASTEST GROWTH SINCE 2021. YOU CAN SEE THE EARNINGS ESTIMATES OVERALL, RECOVERING CLOSE TO THE LEVELS WE HAVE SEEN IN 2022. NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT ON ITS WAY SO PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT IS FUELING THE INTEREST IN THE CHINESE EQUITY MARKET. WE ARE SEEING THE TURNOVER TOPPING 2 TRILLION YUAN, WHICH IS HIGH LEVELS, CLOSE TO THE LEVELS WE SAW DURING THE DEEPSEEK MOMENT. THIS IS DESPITE THE CREDIT DATA OUT OF THE PBOC LAST NIGHT SHOWING A CONTRACTION. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY TWO DECADES, CORPORATE AND HOUSEHOLDS ARE PULLING BACK THEIR BORROWING, FOCUSING MORE ON PAYING BACK LOANS RATHER THAN TAKING OUT NEW LOANS AND THAT REFLECTS THE SENTIMENT, THE WEAKNESS IN CONSUMER APPETITE FOR SPENDING IN CHINA. LIZZY: TARIFFS, WHAT TARIFFS? THANK YOU FOR THAT LOOK AT THE EARNINGS, MINMIN LOW OUT OF HONG KONG. LET'S GO TO AFRICA. THE U.S. IS CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGAL MINING IN EASTERN CONGO AND THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT SANCTIONED AN ARMED AND TWO HONG KONG-BASED FIRMS ACCUSING THEM OF FUEL IT -- FUELING VIOLENCE AND SMUGGLING MINERALS. ONDIRO JOINS US NOW. IS THIS AN INDICATION THAT THE U.S. IS FULLY COMMITTED TO RESOLVING THE CONFLICT? ONDIRO: 100%. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE, IT INDICATES AND POINTS TO THAT. THE U.S. IN THE REGION -- WE HAVE SEEN A 360 DEGREE SHIFT. FROM WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A FORGOTTEN CONFLICT, IT IS AT THE CENTER OF NEWS, TOP OF MIND IN AMERICA. THEY WARNED THE U.S. WILL NOT HESITATE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST ANY GROUP THAT WILL PREVENT THE U.S. FROM ACCESSING CRITICAL MINERALS VITAL FOR THEIR NATIONAL DEFENSE. THIS OUTLINES WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN THE AREA. IT HIGHLIGHTS A GROUP THAT IS ONE OF MORE THAN 100 ARMED GROUPS OPERATING IN THE EASTERN PART OF DRC IN A QUEST FOR TERRITORY THEY SAY THEY HAVE BEEN MINING ILLEGAL MINERALS, TAXING LOCALS AND THEY WERE SOLD BY -- TO A LOCAL BRC COMPANY BEFORE THEY WERE SOLD TO THE HONG KONG-BASED COMPANIES. THIS IS WHERE THE PROBLEM COMES IN, WHERE THE U.S. SAYS THEY HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT MINERALS THEY CAME FROM AN AREA THAT HAS CONFLICT MAKING THEM BLOOD MINERALS SMUGGLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. THERE ARE TWO INTERESTING THINGS, RUBAYA PRODUCES 13-50% OF GLOBAL PRODUCTION AND BEING CONTROLLED BY AN ORGANIZATION, WILL WE SEE SANCTIONS AGAINST THEM? CHOICES HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND THE CONSEQUENCES REMAIN IN THIS STATEMENT. THERE WILL BE BLOCKED, THERE WILL BE SANCTIONS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE U.S. IS DOING THAT, SANCTIONING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, SANCTIONING A REFINERY AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE BOARD TO SEND A MESSAGE THAT IF YOU INTERFERE WITH OUR BUSINESS INTEREST IN DRC THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES. LIZZY: ON THAT, HOW IS AMERICAN BUSINESS INTEREST TAKING SHAPE IN THE DRC SO FAR? ONDIRO: WE ARE SEEING A FEW PROJECTS BEGIN TO MATERIALIZE AND BEGIN TO UNFOLD IN A WAY THAT OFFERS SOME PROMISE. IF YOU LOOK AT A NEW YORK FIRM, THEY INTEND TO BUILD 140 MEGAWATTS OF ELECTRICITY PROJECTS ALONG THE BORDER OF DRC AND RWANDA. THIS DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE COUNTRIES CAN IMPLEMENT A PEACE DEAL STEWARDED BY THE U.S. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. A $700 MILLION PROJECT ON A LAKE, AND ONE POINT $5 BILLION ELECTRICITY PROJECT THAT GOES ALL THE WAY FROM ANGOLA TO THE MINES IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. THERE IS ONLY ONE PROBLEM WHICH BECOMES, THIS IS AN AREA UNDER THE CONTROL OF AND 23. UNTIL THERE IS STABILITY, THIS PROJECT CANNOT HAPPEN. M23 HAVEN'T SHOWN ANY INDICATION THEY ARE WILLING TO BACK DOWN. IF ANYTHING THEY ARE STANDING ON THEIR TERRITORY AND SAYING THEY AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE. LIZZY: GREAT REPORTING, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WANT TO HEAD SOUTH, SOUTH AFRICA PUSHING BACK AGAINST A REPORT BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THAT SAYS THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY WORSENED LAST YEAR. PRETORIA CALLS THE FINDINGS INACCURATE AND BIASED, ACCUSING WASHINGTON OF RELYING ON DISCREDITED SOURCES. JENNIFER JOINS US NOW FROM JOHANNESBURG. WHAT MORE DO THEY HAVE TO SAY? JENNIFER: THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE WORSENING SITUATION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTH AFRICA. IF WE LOOK AT WHAT WE DID FROM PRETORIA, THEY SAID PROFOUND DISAPPOINTMENT IN A DEEPLY FLAWED REPORT. THOSE WORDS, COMING FROM THEM. THAT IS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE ADVISORY WE GOT FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT, WHICH I WAS LOOKING AT, AS YOU POINTED OUT, THEY DO NOTE THERE IS A WORSENING SITUATION BUT THEY SAY THE SITUATION DID HAPPEN AFTER THE SIGNING AFTER THE EXPROPRIATION BILL WE SAW. OF COURSE, MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOTED THE INACCURACIES THAT HAVE BEEN TOUTED BY THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION ABOUT SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THIS BILL. SOUTH AFRICAN NOTES THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY IRONIC THE U.S. IS THROWING ACCUSATIONS AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THIS IS A COUNTRY, THE U.S., THAT ACTUALLY EXITED THE YOU AND HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL AND SOUTH AFRICA NOTING A LOT OF WHAT THEY SEE AS NOT PRESERVING THE RIGHTS OF HUMANS IN THE U.S., TALKING ABOUT THE SITUATIONS WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS SINCE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN WITH THE ICE ARRESTS AND SUCH. IT SEEMS LIKE AGAIN, THE SITUATION BETWEEN THESE COUNTRIES IS SOURING, SO MUCH SO THAT SOUTH AFRICA FEELS THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PRESENT AND REITERATE THE FACTS THAT THEY HAVE TRIED TO DO, WE SAW PRESIDENT GRUMA POSA DO IT IN THE WHITE HOUSE NEXT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT THEY PUT OUT A NOTE AFTER THE ADVISORY FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYING THEY PLAN TO SUBMIT DOCUMENTS A SAY, WHAT THE U.N. HAS SAID ABOUT THE EXPROPRIATION BILL THAT POTENTIALLY, IT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD FOR MINORITIES IN THE COUNTRY. THIS IS A REMINDER COMING A FEW MONTHS BEFORE SOUTH AFRICA IS HOSTING THE G20 CONFERENCE, WHICH WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO BE HERE. LIZZY: WHEN YOU HAVE MUD BEING SLUNG IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE TRADE TALKS? JENNIFER: THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST CONCERNING. FOR SOUTH AFRICA. WHAT WE DO KNOW, THE SAME DAY THE ADVISORY CAME, OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOUTH AFRICA SUBMITTED A REVISED TRADE OFFER TO THE U.S. AND THIS IS BECAUSE WE KNOW SOUTH AFRICA HAD THE IMPOSITION OF 30% TARIFFS, SOMETHING A NUMBER OF ECONOMISTS AND ANALYSTS HAVE SAID COULD REALLY HURT A NUMBER OF KEY INDUSTRIES FOR THE ECONOMY. THE GOVERNMENT IS ALSO SAYING THEY ARE PRIORITIZING A NUMBER OF THINGS WE FOCUSED ON, DIVERSIFICATION OF EXPORTS, A RESPONSE PACKAGE FOR SOME OF THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE HURT, AUTOS AND CITRUS, AND DIVERSIFICATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY WILL FOCUS ON THEIR EXPORTS TO THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SOME OF THE OTHER MARKETS IN ASIA AS WELL THAT THEY SAY HAVE SHOWN AN INTEREST IN SOUTH AFRICAN EXPORTS. I WANT TO POINT OUT, ALL OF THIS COMES AND YET BUSINESS CONFIDENCE IN SOUTH AFRICA, HITTING A FOUR MONTH HIGH. WHERE DID THINGS GO FROM HERE? WHAT IS THIS MEAN FOR THE SOUTH AFRICAN ECONOMY? LIZZY: WHAT TARIFFS? THANKS FOR THE COVERAGE, JENNIFER. COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM, WE WILL TALK TO THE CFO OF OMAN'S O Q PRODUCTION ABOUT HIS COMPANY'S EARNINGS. THAT IS NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a LIZZY: WE GO TO OMAN, WHERE OQ EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION SAYS FIRST UP AND FELL ALMOST 11% DUE TO RISING FINANCE COSTS. THE ENERGY COMPANY REPORTED REVENUE REMAINING FLAT DESPITE THE LOWER PRICE PRESSURES FOR OIL. FOR MORE I'M JOINED BY JABER AL-NOUMANI. I APPRECIATE YOU MAKING TIME FOR US. WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. AS DISCUSSED, IT WAS A CHALLENGING MACROENVIRONMENT LAST ORDER. LOWER OIL PRICES AFFECTING HUMAN PARTICULAR. HOW HAS OQ WHETHER THAT? JABER: THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING. IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGING QUARTER. ALSO FOR H1 AS WELL. DESPITE THE PRODUCTION, WE WERE ABLE TO PROVE THE OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE RESILIENCE IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES, HOW WE MOVE THROUGH THESE TIMES. WE MANAGED TO INCREASE PRODUCTION BY ALMOST 1.1 MILLION BARRELS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT OIL PRICES DROPPED BY ALMOST EIGHT DOLLARS. THIS YEAR, AS COMPARED TO 2024. WE MANAGED TO MAINTAIN OUR TOP LINE REVENUE AT ALMOST $1 BILLION, AND WE POSTED A PROFIT OF OVER $400 BILLION. LIZZY: TALK ABOUT THE BUYBACK. WHY ANNOUNCE IT A FEW WEEKS AGO AND NOT SOONER? JABER: THE BUYBACK PROGRAM WAS I WOULD SAY A PROCESS WE WENT THROUGH. WE DISCUSSED WITH THE AUTHORITIES, AND THE DECISION CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME WHEN THE OIL PRICE STARTED FALLING AROUND APRIL THIS YEAR. WE BASICALLY LOOKED INTO THE OTHER MAJORS IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY, AND WE DECIDED TO START EXERCISING THAT OPTION. LOOKING TO ARRAY -- INTO A RANGE OF BUYBACK PROGRAMS FROM 45-60,000,000. LIZZY: THAT HASN'T HURT THE SHARE PRICE. I WONDER IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT JOINING THE MSCI E.M. INDEX OR MAYBE THE FTSE. JABER: WE ARE IN JULY THIS YEAR, WE JOINED THE MSCI INDEX.

OTHERS AND MULTIPLE BLOCKS, EITHER IN OIL OR GAS. WE ARE LOOKING FOR SUCH OPPORTUNITIES TOGETHER. LIZZY: IF YOU ARE FOCUSING WITHIN OMAN, ARE YOU LOOKING AT MAY BE INVESTING IN THE NEW LNG TRADE?

COMING UP, A JAILED POLITICAL RIVAL OF THE TURKISH PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IS OPEN TO ENDORSING ANOTHER CANDIDATE IF HE IS UNABLE TO RUN IN THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. WE WILL HAVE MORE, NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a LIZZY: WELCOME BACK TO HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA. TO TURKEY, A JAILED POLITICAL RIVAL OF TURKISH PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IS OPEN TO ENDORSING ANOTHER CANDIDATE IF HE IS UNABLE TO RUN IN THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. ISTANBUL MAYOR IMAMOGLU, WHO HAS BEEN JAILED FOR FIVE MONTHS, SAYS THE DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY IS AT STAKE AND FOR MORE I'M JOINED BY BLOOMBERG'S MANAGING EDITOR FOR THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THANKS FOR JOINING US. THIS WAS THE MAYOR'S FIRST INTERVIEW WITH FOREIGN MEDIA. WHAT DID HE SAY? > > AS YOU SAID, THIS IS HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE HE WAS JAILED IN MARCH. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING MAYOR IMAMOGLU SAID IS HE WOULD ENDORSE AND SUPPORT A UNIFIED OPPOSITION CANDIDATE AGAINST PRESIDENT ERDOGAN, OR A SUCCESSOR THAT HE MIGHT NAME DOWN THE ROAD IN THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. SHOULD HE BE UNABLE TO RUN HIMSELF. AS THE MAYOR HIMSELF SAID, HE IS NOT NAIVE ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT HE IS COMING OUT OF JAIL ANYTIME SOON. THERE ARE MANY LEGAL AND OTHER BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES THAT MIGHT PREVENT HIM FROM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT DOWN THE ROAD. HIS UNIVERSITY DIPLOMA, WHICH IS A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT TO RUN FOR HIGH OFFICE IN TURKEY, HAS BEEN RETRACTED AND HE IS FACING A MYRIAD OF CHARGES THAT COULD BAR HIM FROM BEING A CANDIDATE IF HE IS CONVICTED DOWN THE ROAD. THIS IS BASICALLY THE GIST OF WHAT THE MAYOR SAID IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT HE SAID DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS ARE AT STAKE AND HE CRITICIZED SOME OF THE WESTERN ALLIES OF TURKEY FOR BEING SILENT OF HIS BEING DETAINED ON WHAT HE SAYS OR DRUMMED UP OR MADE UP CHARGES. LIZZY: THIS HAS THE MARKET MOVING CONSEQUENCES. FOR OUR GLOBAL AUDIENCE, REMIND US WHY HE WAS IMPRISONED. ONUR: IMAMOGLU HAS BEEN THE MAYOR OF ISTANBUL SINCE 2019, WHEN HE DEALT A SEVERE BLOW TO ERDOGAN'S GOVERNING PARTY AKP, THE FIRST LOSS OF ERDOGAN SUFFERED IN OVER TWO DECADES. HE HAS BEEN A TARGET OF VARIOUS PROBES. HE SAID ALL OF THOSE PROBES ARE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED, BUT THE SUBJECT OF THE PROBES ARE CORRUPTION CHARGES AND TERRORISM RELATED CHARGES IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER MINOR ONES LIKE THREATENING A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR FOR CRITICIZING HIM ON PUBLIC TELEVISION. BUT THOSE MAKEUP THE BULK OF THE ACQUISITIONS -- THE ACCUSATIONS, TERRORISM AND CORRUPTION, AND THEY COULD PUT HIM BEHIND BARS FOR YEARS IF CONVICTED. LIZZY: AN INCREDIBLE CONVERSATION. WE APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS TEST. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED READ ON THE TERMINAL. ONUR, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE HAVE HAD PLENTY OF RESULTS ON THIS PROGRAM BUT THERE IS ONE SET THAT REALLY WE CARE ABOUT AND THAT IS FOR FOOTBALL FANS. PARIS ST. GERMAIN BEATS TOPSHAM -- TOTTENHAM TO WIN THE CUP ON WEDNESDAY.
