  "content": "Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) campaigned with New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Tuesday, slamming both President Trump and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\u201cNew York has always stood up to bullies and defended what\u2019s right, even when it\u2019s difficult, which is why we were so shocked to learn that Andrew Cuomo called Donald Trump for advice after the Democratic primary,\u201d Nadler said at a press conference alongside Mamdani. \u201cThis betrayal shows exactly what we\u2019re up against: politicians willing to legitimize our city\u2019s greatest threat for their personal benefit. The truth is, Cuomo and Trump are very similar. \u201c\n\n\u201cBoth use their power to serve themselves and their wealthy donors, not the people. If it weren\u2019t clear before, it should be now. Donald Trump is no friend to our city, and neither is Andrew Cuomo. This is why the choice for New York City\u2019s next mayor is so critical,\u201d he added.\n\nMamdani recently heavily criticized reported moves by Trump regarding the New York City mayoral race.\n\n\u201cToday we learned Andrew Cuomo is directly coordinating with Donald Trump, even as this President sends masked agents to rip our neighbors off the streets and guts the social services so many New Yorkers rely on,\u201d Mamdani said in a Wednesday post on the social platform X.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disqualifying and a betrayal of our city,\u201d he added.\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that eight sources said the president talked in private about stepping into the race in an attempt to stop Mamdani from winning the November election.\n\nAccording to the Times, a Republican congressman and New York businessmen have been recently pressed by the president about which of Mamdani\u2019s rivals they believe could win against the Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a candidate for New York City mayor, discussed the race in a phone call within the last few weeks, the Times also reported.\n\nDuring a press conference last week, Cuomo said he couldn\u2019t \u201cremember the last time I spoke to President Trump,\u201d also adding that he has \u201cnever spoken to him about the mayor\u2019s race.\u201d\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a spokesperson for Cuomo and the White House for comment.",
