  "description": "The American Accountability Foundation wants 175 federal employees removed from their jobs for allegedly promoting liberal ideologies.",
  "content": "ATLANTA, Aug 7 (Reuters) - In February, federal worker Stefanie Anderson sat at her kitchen table with her husband and asked questions she never imagined having to face: Were their children safe? Should they pull them from school? Should they leave their home?\n\nA friend had sent her a link to a \u201cDEI Watchlist\u201d published by the American Accountability Foundation, a right-wing group with ties to senior officials in U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. It listed Anderson\u2019s name, photo, salary and work history, and accused her and other federal employees of pushing \u201cradical\u201d diversity, equity and inclusion policies in government.\n\nThe longtime public health worker spent much of her career at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, specializing in infectious disease outbreaks. Her work included a deployment to Sierra Leone during the Ebola crisis. More recently, she supported HIV prevention programs. After her profile appeared on the site, her phone rang for a month with about 30 calls a day from unknown numbers.\n\nAnderson changed her hairstyle to avoid recognition, stayed indoors, rerouted packages from her Atlanta home and reminded her children to lock the doors and check the security cameras. As a Black woman, she said, the experience reminded her of 19th-century fugitive slave ads. \u201cIt made me feel like a criminal on a wanted poster.\u201d\n\nAnderson is among 175 federal employees, mostly civil servants, named on \u201cwatchlists\u201d posted online by the American Accountability Foundation, which wants them removed from their jobs for allegedly promoting liberal ideologies. Many are women and people of color with long careers under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Most have little or no public profile and have spent their careers in behind-the-scenes government roles.\n\nReuters spoke with two-dozen people on the lists, all sharing their stories for the first time. Some bolstered home security or avoided going out in public. Others deleted social media accounts or scrubbed personal information from the internet. More than half wrestled with anxiety. Some described a quiet unraveling of their lives, experiencing depression, feeling a need to disappear.\n\nThrough legal filings, public records and interviews with more than three dozen sources, Reuters traced AAF\u2019s evolution from a Biden-focused opposition research outfit to a sharp instrument in the Trump movement\u2019s campaign to root out perceived enemies.\n\nAAF\u2019s target is the federal workforce. Half the people on AAF\u2019s watchlists \u2013 at least 88 \u2013 have left government or been forced onto administrative leave. Some were fired amid Trump\u2019s mass federal layoffs. Others departed over fears of termination or reassignment. At least two, worried about their safety, have fled the country.\n\nRather than aiming at high-profile political appointees, AAF\u2019s lists focus mostly on career civil servants who execute the policy of the administration in power. AAF President Tom Jones and his backers argue that many of these employees lean liberal and could work quietly to undermine Trump\u2019s agenda, so the public deserves to know their identities.\n\n\u201cThey want to be unaccountable bureaucrats who work in these agencies and never get seen,\u201d he told Fox News in June 2024. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna tell you who these people are and what they\u2019re about.\u201d\n\nJones did not respond to a detailed list of questions about AAF or the impact of its watchlists on the civil servants it targets, but defended its work in a statement to Reuters. \"It's important that anti-Trump civil servants know someone is watching and taking names; we stand by our research and reporting, with our only regret being that more people on our lists haven't left government and handed their jobs over to patriots who will execute on the agenda the American people voted for in November.\"\n\nSince October, AAF has published three watchlists. The first, a \u201cDHS Watchlist,\u201d named 60 federal employees as \u201ctargets\u201d for their work on immigration policy at the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, including nearly a dozen immigration judges. In January, AAF published two more: one identifying \u201cpolitical ideologues\u201d at the Education Department, and one featuring staff who worked on diversity initiatives at other federal agencies.\n\nEach site includes photos and personal details drawn from public records and social media, along with allegations of \u201csubversive,\u201d \u201cdivisive\u201d or \u201cleft-wing\u201d transgressions such as donating to Democrats or supporting immigrant aid groups. Federal employees, however, are allowed to engage in such political activity privately under federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on political affiliation.\n\nBy launching the first list ahead of the 2024 election, the group helped translate Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to \u201cclean out the deep state\u201d into a database of names and faces. After the DHS list went live, one commenter on AAF\u2019s X account posted a photo of bullets. X did not respond to questions about the post.\n\nAs Trump wages a self-described campaign of \u201cretribution,\u201d federal workers on AAF\u2019s lists have paid a price. In Maryland, a mother at a public library with her toddler was confronted by a woman who said she recognized her from the list. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is disgusting,\u201d the stranger said. In Texas, a man shattered a window of an immigration judge\u2019s home and called her a \u201ctraitor.\u201d In Georgia, police stationed a patrol car outside a CDC employee\u2019s home for a week after she was named for working on initiatives to expand healthcare access in low-income and minority communities.\n\nTo the people targeted by AAF, its sites are engines of reputational harm and invitations to harassment. AAF, however, stops short of crossing an important line, say free-speech experts: It omits home addresses, phone numbers and other intimate identifiers associated with doxxing \u2013 the publishing of personal information online with malicious intent. By that standard, the sites remain just outside the boundaries of potential criminal violations of privacy. But legal experts say the watchlists could deter civil servants from politically sensitive work, creating a chilling effect on public service.\n\n\u201cWhat is so ominous about these sites is that they\u2019re close to the line of illegal, but not crossing the line,\u201d said University of Virginia School of Law professor Danielle Citron, a specialist in online privacy. \u201cThey are designed to silence and intimidate and to inspire other people to hurt\u201d people named on the site.\n\nAAF promotes its work as part of a broader effort to defend Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform. On its websites, the group says it exposes \u201cthe truth behind the people and groups undermining American democracy\u201d and serves as \u201ca go-to resource for policy makers and their staffs.\u201d It makes its goal clear to its targets: \u201cIf you see yourself on this list and wish to be removed,\u201d it says on the watchlists, \u201cplease forward us evidence that you've resigned or been fired.\u201d\n\nAs AAF singles out federal employees for alleged political bias, the Trump administration has moved to loosen restrictions meant to keep partisanship out of government work. In April, it relaxed enforcement of the Hatch Act, a nearly century-old law designed to insulate the civil service from partisan political pressure. The change allows federal employees to openly support the sitting president while at work, wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats at their desks, for instance.\n\nAAF received $100,000 last year from the conservative Heritage Foundation to support its work, public records show. Much of its early funding and organizational backing came from groups aligned with Trump, including one run by Russell Vought, now Trump\u2019s budget director, and another headed by Stephen Miller, a senior Trump advisor. AAF\u2019s Jones was an advisor on the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025, which calls for slashing the federal workforce and marginalizing \u201cwoke culture warriors.\u201d\n\nHeritage, Vought, Miller and the White House did not respond to questions, including inquiries about ties between administration officials and AAF or the impact of the watchlists on personnel decisions.\n\nMore than 200,000 federal employees have left government service since Trump took office. The administration says roughly 154,000 accepted buyout offers, while an estimated 55,000 were fired or laid off, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that tracks federal workforce trends. Reuters could not confirm whether the watchlists influenced staffing decisions. The Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services said they did not. The Education and Homeland Security departments did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFor those named by AAF, the consequences can be swift.\n\nNoelle Sharp had served as chief federal immigration judge in Houston for three years without incident. Immigration judges are employees of the Justice Department and enjoy civil-service protections. Sharp\u2019s life was upended last October when her photograph appeared on AAF\u2019s \u201cDHS Watchlist,\u201d which claimed to identify \u201cAmerica\u2019s most subversive immigration bureaucrats.\u201d\n\nAAF targeted Sharp on multiple fronts. Her name was posted alongside details of her career and a pointed accusation: She \u201cmade her bones keeping criminal aliens out of jail and away from deportation.\u201d\n\nThe group questioned her impartiality, citing her decade-long career as a private immigration attorney and her earlier work with Catholic Charities, a nonprofit that provides legal and humanitarian aid to migrants. The organization, affiliated with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, has long been a target of the far right for its role in refugee resettlement and assisting migrants. AAF accused the group of facilitating \u201cmass migration,\u201d a claim Catholic Charities denies.\n\nAAF also flagged a 2017 social media post in which Sharp, then a private attorney, called Trump an \u201cembarrassment\u201d and an \u201cidiot\u201d after he criticized NATO allies for leaving the U.S. with a disproportionate share of Europe\u2019s defense costs.\n\nSharp said AAF falsely portrayed her as biased. When she applied with the Justice Department to become a judge, she said she underwent extensive vetting that began during Trump\u2019s first administration. Her focus, she said, was on clearing immigration backlogs and ensuring cases were handled \u201cefficiently, effectively and fairly.\u201d\n\nOn the day the list was published, the right-wing Gateway Pundit website ran a story amplifying the claims and casting Sharp as among a cadre of left-wing bureaucrats accused of betraying America by \"sabotaging border security.\u201d In the comments section, one reader called for Sharp and others on the list \u201cto hang for treason.\u201d\n\nA week later, she said, a stranger appeared at her home, shouting and pounding on the front door until a window shattered. \u201cTerrorist,\u201d the man called her. He accused her of letting criminals into the country. \u201cSomeone should do something about you,\u201d he yelled. Alone at home, Sharp stepped outside and tried to reason with him. \u201cA lot of what you read on social media isn\u2019t true,\u201d she told him. He kicked her door and left.\n\nSharp said she chose not to report the incident to police, fearing the man might live nearby and retaliate. She informed her supervisors. In late November, she found her car windshield smashed. This time her supervisors alerted the U.S. Marshals Service, which protects federal judges. The Marshals, she said, gave her a phone app to alert authorities in an emergency.\n\nThe Marshals Service declined to comment on Sharp\u2019s case or the watchlist. Reuters was unable to determine whether any suspects were identified or what motivated them. In response to an inquiry from Reuters, the Gateway Pundit said it would remove the comment suggesting people on the watchlist should hang for treason.\n\nOn February 14, Sharp was fired. Immigration judges, unlike federal judges with lifetime appointments, serve at the discretion of the attorney general and can be reassigned or dismissed, provided there is cause and due process. Sharp said she believes her inclusion on the watchlist contributed to her dismissal. \u201cIf I hadn't been on the DHS Watchlist, I don't believe I would have lost my job,\u201d she told Reuters.\n\nSharp requested that AAF remove her photo from its website but said she received no response. Her profile remains on the site. Citing safety concerns because of the watchlist, she recently moved to Mexico with her husband and now works remotely as an immigration attorney.\n\nHer firing coincides with a broader purge. Since Trump took office in January, at least 106 immigration judges have been fired, reassigned or accepted buyouts, according to the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, which represents most of them. Almost all were dismissed without cause, the union said.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on Sharp\u2019s firing or the broader purge of immigration judges.\n\nAAF was launched in December 2020, weeks after Trump lost his re-election bid to Joe Biden. Its initial mission, as Jones said in a 2021 Fox News interview, was \u201cto take a big handful of sand and throw it in the gears of the Biden administration.\u201d\n\nThe group traces its roots to a network of Trump-aligned nonprofits led by the Conservative Partnership Institute, headed by former Senator Jim DeMint and Mark Meadows, who served as chief of staff in Trump\u2019s first presidency. CPI provided $335,100, more than half of AAF\u2019s first-year funding, according to tax filings.\n\nThe next year, CPI provided another $210,000, and two other CPI affiliates also chipped in. The Center for Renewing America, led by Trump budget chief Vought, and America First Legal, headed by Trump adviser Miller, contributed $100,000 and $25,000, respectively.\n\nVought, a self-described Christian nationalist, and Miller were fixtures in Trump\u2019s first White House and have reemerged as architects of his second-term agenda. At its inception, both CPI and America First Legal identified themselves in tax filings as a \"direct controlling entity\" of AAF.\n\nDeMint, CPI, America First Legal and the Center for Renewing America did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRoughly a decade before AAF launched, Jones, Miller and Vought were congressional staffers aligned with DeMint and other right-wing lawmakers in an insurgency against the Republican establishment. Jones built a reputation for opposition research, said a former DeMint staffer who worked alongside him. \u201cJones was one of the harder-edged guys,\u201d the ex-colleague said.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, AAF launched Bidennoms.com to target Biden administration nominees. The site, no longer active, featured profiles of nominees accompanied by disparaging and at times misleading commentary. In interviews at the time, Jones said he was inspired by the Democrats\u2019 success in undermining some of Trump\u2019s first-term nominees to top administration posts.\n\nIn June 2022, as Trump prepared to run again, the Heritage Foundation named AAF a partner in Project 2025, a transition plan that called for a dramatic rollback of the federal bureaucracy, including DEI initiatives. Two years later, Heritage awarded AAF $100,000 to launch \u201cProject Sovereignty 2025,\u201d a database of federal employees involved in Biden-era immigration policy.\n\nAfter launching his DEI Watchlist in January, Jones told Fox News, \u201cWe're going to help the Trump administration identify the people they need to get out of these positions.\u201d\n\nAAF's watchlists disproportionately feature women. Although women make up less than half of the federal workforce, they account for more than two-thirds of the 175 federal employees named across the three lists, according to a Reuters analysis. About 50% of those listed are racial and ethnic minorities, compared with 41% of the overall federal workforce.\n\nPatricia Kramer, a 43-year-old U.S. Army veteran and Hispanic employment strategist at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, said that seeing her name and photograph appear on the list in February triggered the same anxiety she felt during her 2009 deployment to Iraq, when she lived under the constant threat of being targeted by enemy soldiers.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know who you\u2019re emboldening by posting a list of people that strangers should focus their attention on,\u201d said Kramer. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\nAfter returning from Iraq, Kramer earned a degree in psychology, motivated by the mental health struggles she and other soldiers faced. A daughter of Mexican immigrants, she later joined the NIH, working to improve Hispanic representation in staffing and research.\n\nThe DEI Watchlist labeled Kramer and 95 others on the site as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bureaucrats Most Abusing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\u201d\n\nThe watchlist highlighted portions of Kramer\u2019s biography that described her collaboration with Hispanic communities, efforts to promote equitable hiring and her work with the Office of Refugee Resettlement during the Biden administration. The group described her record as \u201cshocking\u201d and incompatible with Trump\u2019s policy goals.\n\nKramer sees her biography as a testament to a public service career spent helping underserved communities. After being spotlighted on the site, she became hypervigilant.\n\nKramer avoided leaving home, scanned her surroundings constantly and monitored her street for anything unusual. Her greatest fear was for her 17-year-old son. \u201cI was afraid that some unhinged individual would make it his duty to confront those of us on the list,\u201d she said. And \u201cpotentially hurt one of us or our family members.\u201d\n\nShe spent months trying to get her photo removed from the site. In February, she filed a takedown request with the site\u2019s hosting platform, Webflow, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which prohibits unauthorized online distribution of copyrighted material.\n\nDocuments related to her takedown request, reviewed by Reuters, show that Webflow initially complied and removed her photo.\n\nIn March, AAF submitted a counter complaint with the host, arguing that the image was an \u201cofficial government portrait,\u201d one of the documents show. AAF also replaced her photo with an illustration of a woman in an office, accompanied by a caption: \u201cDEI bureaucrats are so ashamed of what they\u2019re doing that they don\u2019t want to show their faces.\u201d\n\nKramer contacted Webflow again to prevent her image from being reinstated. By April, a new photo \u2013 taken from Kramer\u2019s LinkedIn profile \u2013 appeared on the site. Kramer has not succeeded in having it taken down.\n\nA Webflow spokesperson declined to comment on the case but said the law allows users to reinstate content if no legal action is taken within 10 to 14 days by the complainant.\n\nTo assist others on the watchlist, Kramer wrote a guide explaining how to file takedown requests. At least eight colleagues initially succeeded in removing their photos, she said. But AAF challenged those removals, arguing \u2014 as it had in Kramer\u2019s case \u2014 that the images were \u201cofficial government portraits,\u201d according to the document reviewed by Reuters. AAF succeeded in reinstating their photos.\n\n\u201cThe length at which they\u2019re willing to go to intimidate and scare people is just ridiculous,\u201d Kramer said, who was terminated from her job in July.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the NIH and CDC, did not answer questions about Kramer or others fired after appearing on AAF watchlists. In a statement, the agency said the lists were not considered in personnel decisions, but added, \u201cDEI has no place at HHS in the Trump Administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not apologize for restoring a culture of merit, integrity and neutrality in federal service,\u201d said spokesperson Andrew Nixon.\n\n\u201cI FELT LIKE I HAD TO DISAPPEAR\u201d\n\nShelby Guillen Dominguez, 34, says she felt a wave of fear when she saw her name on the DEI Watchlist in February.\n\nThe site criticized her work as a diversity program specialist at the Department of Health and Human Services. It featured video of a university speech where she discussed expanding opportunities for students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. The site claimed, without evidence, that her remarks excluded \u201ccertain races.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even mention race,\u201d Dominguez said in an interview. \u201cIt felt like they were framing me as an enemy of the state.\u201d\n\nAAF shared her information on its X account, which has more than 23,000 followers, accusing her of dropping \u201cdiversity\u201d from her title \u201cin a sad attempt to keep her job.\u201d One commenter called for her to be \u201cfired and investigated.\u201d The title change, however, was part of a department-wide reorganization announced a month earlier.\n\nDominguez deleted her social media accounts, locked her credit report and set up alerts to monitor online mentions of her name. She said she stayed indoors, sought therapy, and was prescribed medication for anxiety and depression. She had been at HHS for six months when she was placed on administrative leave in January under Trump\u2019s executive order targeting federal DEI programs. In July, she was officially terminated.\n\n\u201cIt was always my dream to work for the federal government,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s all crumbling.\u201d\n\nKiana Atkins, a longtime federal employee, felt similar stress after landing on the watchlist in January. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d said Atkins, 46, who worked at the NIH. \u201cI was afraid to go out by myself.\u201d\n\nAtkins joined the agency in 2022 after working for the Census Bureau and the U.S. Navy. Her job focused on reducing employment barriers for Black employees and mentoring students. After being named, she experienced severe anxiety and withdrew from a professional development program. She temporarily disabled her LinkedIn account and tried unsuccessfully to remove her name from AAF\u2019s site.\n\nNo longer feeling safe at home alone, she said she made the difficult decision to leave the U.S. and live with family in Central America. She accepted a government buyout and moved in February.\n\n\u201cI did not feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I had to disappear.\u201d\n\nSome named on the watchlists are fighting back.\n\nAnderson, the CDC worker who altered her appearance and told her kids to lock the doors, is a member of a complaint filed in March with the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an executive branch agency that adjudicates federal employment disputes. The complaint accuses the Trump administration of violating federal workers\u2019 civil and constitutional rights by removing employees alleged to be involved in DEI work. The federal Civil Service Reform Act prohibits personnel decisions based on perceived political affiliation and is meant to protect career staff from the politicization of their work.\n\n\u201cYou can't mistreat government workers because you assume they do not share your politics,\u201d said Kelly Dermody, one of the attorneys representing the employees.\n\nThe White House has said its directives to eliminate DEI personnel and programs across the federal government were aimed at ending what it describes as unlawful preferences in federal hiring and ensuring neutrality in government activities. The case is pending.\n\nAnderson said the watchlist distorted her work and harmed her reputation without giving her a chance to respond.\n\nAAF claimed that Anderson \u201cdiscretely (sic) updated\u201d her LinkedIn title \u2014 from Advisor on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility to Public Health Advisor \u2014 to evade a Trump executive order and obscure her \u201ctrue duties.\u201d Anderson said she changed her title after moving into a new role in December. The group also accused her of supporting efforts to muzzle free speech after she liked a LinkedIn post warning about the dangers of health-related misinformation.\n\nDays after her name appeared, Anderson was placed on administrative leave. The Health and Human Services Department declined to comment specifically on her case.\n\nMonths later, Anderson, 50, still avoids crowds, doesn\u2019t go out after dark and flinches when the doorbell rings. She choked back tears as she recalled her 13-year-old daughter asking, \u201cDo people hate us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe that this is my life in 2025,\u201d Anderson said.",

  "summary": "The American Accountability Foundation (AF), a right-wing group with ties to senior officials in President Donald Trump's administration, has published three watchlists targeting federal employees for promoting liberal ideologies. The list, which also includes 60 federal employees on immigration policy, accuses federal employees of pushing \"radical\" diversity, equity and inclusion policies in government. The majority of these federal employees have been women and people of color with long careers under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Half of the people on the watchlists have left government or been forced onto administrative leave. The group's President, Tom Jones, defended the action, stating that many of these employees lean liberal and could work quietly to undermine Trump's agenda.",

      "text": "From Bibles to prayer groups: What Trump's new religion memo for federal workers means\nThe memo provides guidance on religious expression for federal workers. Backers say it mirrors Clinton-era policies. But to others, the overtly Christian language raises First Amendment concerns.\n- The memo comes after Trump issued an executive order on \"Eradicating Anti-Christian Bias\" and established the White House Faith Office and Religious Liberty Commission.\n- The memo's guidance is largely based on existing policy, though some experts said it appears to be less attentive to the risks of religious harassment in the workplace than previous guidance.\n- The memo's examples of acceptable religious expression are from Christian and Jewish traditions, though the Office of Personnel Management said the guidance is applicable to members of all faiths.\nPresident Donald Trump is again making sure his supporters know he is doing his part to bring \u201dreligion back to our country.\u201d\nMost recently, his administration issued a memo in late July outlining to federal employees the types of religious expression allowed in the workplace. Bibles on desks. Groups joining together for prayer. An employee engaging with \u201canother in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs.\u201d\nTo many, it had overtly Christian-centric language, raising concerns about the rights of other religious groups. But backers say the memo reinforces existing policies for federal workers, including similar guidance during the Clinton administration.\nThe memo, which Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor issued to all federal agencies, is \u201cvery much in line\u201d with Trump\u2019s previous actions on religious liberty, according to University of Houston law professor James Nelson.\nOn the campaign trail and elsewhere, Trump has often told religious audiences he would bring religion back and since his second term began has highlighted efforts that appeal to his conservative Christian supporters.\nTrump issued an executive order calling for federal agencies to assist in \u201cEradicating Anti-Christian Bias\u201d in February, which was followed by the establishment of the White House Faith Office and the Religious Liberty Commission. In the commission's first public meeting in June, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said religious liberty had \u201ccome under attack\u201d in the country and vowed to protect religious freedom from \u201cemerging threats.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Office of Personnel Management said the July 28 memo \u201creiterates existing policy\u201d but also updates it in light of U.S. Supreme Court decisions that have upheld religious liberty. It now references, for example, a 2023 ruling in favor of a Christian U.S. Postal Service worker who objected to working on Sundays.\nAlliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal organization, called the new memo a \u201ccritical step in restoring a workplace culture that respects and promotes religious freedom for every American.\u201d\n\u201cNo American should have to check their faith at the door when they walk into the workplace,\u201d the organization\u2019s legal counsel, Michael Ross, said.\nBut experts, including Nelson, said the memo is less attentive to the potential for religious coercion and harassment in the workplace than previous guidance.\nWhat the memo says\nThe five-page memo starts by describing Trump as a champion of religious liberty and goes on to say that the First Amendment, federal statutes and Supreme Court rulings protect federal employees\u2019 rights to religious expression in the workplace.\nIt then describes acceptable forms of religious expression by individual workers and groups of federal workers, including in conversations between federal employees, in interactions with the public and through expressions in areas open to the public.\nThe examples of acceptable forms of religious expression the memo cites are from Christian and Jewish traditions. They include:\n- \u201cAn employee may keep a Bible on her desk and may read it during breaks. Similarly, an employee may keep rosary beads or tefillin on her desk. During breaks, she may use such items to pray.\u201d\n- \u201cA group of employees may form a prayer group and gather for prayer or study of scripture or holy books at the office while not on duty hours.\u201d\n- \u201cOn a bulletin board meant for personal announcements, a supervisor may post a handwritten note inviting each of his employees to attend an Easter service at his church.\u201d\n- \u201cA park ranger leading a tour through a national park may join her tour group in prayer.\u201d\n- \u201cA receptionist in a doctor\u2019s office at a VA Medical Center may pray with a coworker in the patients\u2019 waiting area.\u201d\nIt also says employees may \u201cengage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs.\u201d It notes, however, that the religious employee should honor any request to end such discussion.\nTrump administration praised Clinton-era guidance on religious expression\nBut these aren\u2019t new policies.\nFormer President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration issued similar guidance in 1997.\nLike the more recent memo, the Clinton-era guidance also permits \u201c(engaging) another in a polite discussion of why his faith should be embraced\u201d and says that, if the speaker is not requested to stop, agencies \u201cshould not restrict or interfere with such speech.\u201d\n\u201cIn a country where freedom of speech and religion are guaranteed, citizens should expect to be exposed to ideas with which they disagree,\u201d the 1997 memo says.\nTrump\u2019s first administration also issued a memo on religious liberty in 2017. It called for federal agencies to \"ensure that they are following\u201d the Clinton-era guidance and referred to it as a \u201cuseful\u201d resource for private employers in accommodating religious expression.\nIn other words, there\u2019s \u201cnothing new\u201d about the guidance, Heritage Foundation senior legal fellow Thomas Jipping said.\nBut he said the enforcement of laws protecting religious liberty have been \u201cinconsistent\u201d across presidential administrations. Jipping referenced a 2015 Supreme Court ruling in favor of religious nonprofits that objected to the contraception mandate in President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\nIn his view, the issue is not an oversaturation of religion in public life but rather some \u201cvery aggressive efforts\u201d to remove it. Jipping applauded what he described as the Trump administration's corrective actions.\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it \u2013 there's a lot of folks out there who want religious people to just shut up and go to church,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s never been, to quote a phrase, \u2018the American way.\u2019 That\u2019s not freedom.\u201d\nOthers are more skeptical of the Trump administration\u2019s actions.\nThe most recent memo is \u201cvery tilted in the direction of recognizing rights of religious expression and very unconcerned or quiet about the problems that might create,\u201d according to George Washington University professor emeritus of law Ira Lupu.\nHe contrasted it with the Clinton-era guidance, which he called \u201cbalanced and fair-minded\" in its acknowledgment of both the religious rights of federal employees and the associated risk of religious harassment in the workplace.\nThe memo says, for example, that federal agencies can\u2019t refuse to hire Buddhists or \u201cimpose more onerous requirements\u201d on Buddhist job applicants, that an employee can have a Koran on their desk and read it during breaks, that employees can wear religious apparel like crucifixes or hijabs, and that employers may not force a Jehovah\u2019s Witness to take an oath that conflicts with their religious beliefs.\nLupu noted that the new Trump administration memo does not mention Muslims, Buddhists or other minority religious groups.\nThe Office of Personnel Management spokesperson, however, said the guidance is equally applicable to members of those and other faiths. When asked about the potential for religious coercion, the spokesperson said the memo \"makes clear that declining such an invitation should not be a basis for discipline.\"\nFirst Amendment brings 'real tension,' expert says\nNelson said he views a \u201creal tension\u201d between some of the memo's tenets.\nIt cites a 2015 Supreme Court ruling, for example, that found Title VII \u2013 a section of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that bans employment discrimination \u2013 gives religious practices \u201cfavored treatment\u201d under the law. But the memo then goes on to say employees should \"be allowed to engage in private religious expression in work areas to the same extent that they may engage in nonreligious private expression.\"\n\u201cI do think that ... courts may need to deal with that in the years to come,\u201d Nelson said.\nThough he acknowledged some may \u201craise concerns\u201d about the guidance, Princeton University law professor Robert George said he sees \u201cno such tension or conflict\u201d between the Establishment Clause, which bans the government from favoring religion over non-religion, and the right to free exercise of religion.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s shift away from \"strict separationism\" has, in his view, protected Americans' right to express their religious beliefs while also making clear that such expression cannot be presented as the viewpoint of the U.S. government or interfere with others' rights.\n\u201cSo, just as government employees may freely advocate or display symbols of secular causes \u2013 think of rainbow buttons or banners, Black Lives Matter insignia and so forth \u2013 they may freely express their religious opinions and display religious symbols \u2013 subject, as the memo makes clear, to reasonable and viewpoint-neutral time, place and manner regulations,\u201d George said.\nBrieAnna Frank is a First Amendment Reporting Fellow at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Unemployment among Black Americans can be an early sign of economic strain. It\u2019s rising\nThe surge in unemployment among Black Americans could be a troubling sign for the economy, since this segment is often the first hit by economic downturns.\nEconomists have viewed the U.S. labor market as resilient in recent months, but some warn that cracks have started to emerge \u2013 including among the country's Black workforce.\nThe unemployment rate for Black Americans hit 7.2% in July, up from 6.3% a year ago and 6.8% the month before, according to the most recent jobs report from the Labor Department. The most recent surge follows an eye-popping 13% increase from May to June and puts the metric well above the total unemployment rate of 4.2%.\nBlack women in particular have seen a dramatic increase in unemployment over the past year, from 5.5% to 6.3%. Certain states are also seeing exceptionally high unemployment rates for Black people, and some, including Michigan, are hovering near 10%, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.\nEconomists say the unemployment surge for Black Americans this year could be a troubling sign for the economy at large, because this segment is often the first hit by economic downturns. Other ethnic groups may already be seeing the effects of a weakening labor market; unemployment rates among White, Asian and Hispanic or Latino workers ticked up 0.1, 0.4 and 0.2 percentage points in July, respectively. Plus, the picture of a strong labor market took a hit with the release of the most recent jobs report, which showed payroll gains for May and June were revised down by 258,000.\n\"The Black unemployment rate is always the first to go up. That\u2019s always the canary in the coal mine,\u201d said Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nWhy are unemployment rates among Black workers increasing?\nEconomists told USA TODAY job cuts within the federal government could be hitting Black workers especially hard because they make up a significant share of the workforce.\nOverall, Black Americans account for 18% of the federal workforce as of September, compared with 12% of the overall workforce, according to a National Women\u2019s Law Center report in May. Black employees make up an even larger share at some of the agencies that have seen some of the most severe job cuts, like the Department of Education (36%), U.S. Agency for International Development (21%) and the Health and Human Services Department (20.5%), according to September figures from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.\nThe difference is even more stark for Black women, who made up roughly 12% of the federal workforce, nearly twice their participation rate in the civilian labor force, according to 2021 data from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\u201cThis has been a place where Black people are disproportionately more likely to get jobs \u2013 better jobs, well-paying jobs,\u201d Ajilore said.\nEconomists point to business uncertainty under the country\u2019s shifting trade policy as another potential driver as companies pause major decisions like hiring until they have a better understanding of how tariffs will affect their bottom line. A recent survey from the National Association for Business Economics found 1 in 4 companies plan to delay hiring or investments over the next six months.\nThe Trump administration's push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs in the federal government, education and the private sector also could play a role in the recent unemployment figures, creating an \u201cantagonistic posture against the Black workforce\" that may be hurting Black hiring rates, said Andre Perry, a senior fellow and director of the Center for Community Uplift at the Brookings Institution.\nDEI programs often fell short of their goal to close racial gaps \u2013 Black Americans are still outnumbered 12 to 1 by White people in executive roles, for instance. But the pullback may still impact Black Americans' careers and the diversity of executive suites. USA TODAY has reported that in 2023, as the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions and conservative groups targeted DEI efforts at dozens of companies, the ranks of Black executives fell 3% from the year before, twice the rate of White executives.\n\"It\u2019s one of those things where I think it plays a role (in this year's unemployment data), but it\u2019s so difficult to actually pinpoint,\u201d Ajilore said. \"There's no smoking gun.\"\nAnd while Black employees have benefited from a tight labor market in recent years, he said, they may now be more at risk of \"last hired, first fired,\" or the practice of letting the most recently hired employees first as the labor market cools.\nWhich states have the highest unemployment rates among Black Americans?\nCertain communities have seen even more dramatic unemployment gains among Black workers.\nIn Michigan, the unemployment rate for Black people hit 10% in the first quarter \u2013 nearly double the state's total unemployment rate and up 3.2% from 2020, according to the Economic Policy Institute. South Carolina\u2019s rate jumped 3% to 6.9% in that time frame.\nSouth Dakota, Alabama and Maryland had some of the lowest rates at 2.8%, 4.3% and 4.3%, respectively.\n\u201cThe aggregate (labor market) numbers really mask what\u2019s going on at the local level,\u201d Perry said. \u201cSo you see in some places, Black people are in a recession by the looks of it. In other places, Black employment is faring much better.\u201d\nIs this a warning for the economy?\nElizabeth Crofoot, senior economist and principal researcher at Lightcast, said the employment data is \u201calarming.\" Though she noted it was unclear based on earlier figures if the unemployment surge for Black Americans was caused by blips in the data from small sample sizes, she said July's data paints a more detailed picture of declining Black labor force participation.\n\"The labor market data from BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics), it\u2019s volatile month to month \u2013 especially because those response rates are not as high as they used to be, so there is a lot of noise in the data,\u201d she said. But \"this is looking like an emerging trend.\"\nThat could spell bad news for the economy at large. Crofoot said unemployment among Black people tends to rise first in a weakening economy, \"oftentimes due to equity issues.\"\nShe pointed to occupational segregation \u2012 when different demographic groups are more likely to be concentrated in certain parts of the workforce \u2012 as one driver, pointing to how Black employees have a stronger presence in some of the industries that have seen job declines such as the federal workforce, manufacturing (which shed 11,000 jobs between June and July) and wholesale trade (which lost 7,800 jobs).\n\"There are certain sectors of the economy where there are more African Americans ... and typically those jobs are also not the best jobs,\" she said. \"Especially in retail, for example, or lower-end health care sector jobs.\"\nAjilore pointed to Labor Department data that shows more than 300,000 Black women lost their jobs in the first half of 2025 as another sign the rise could be the start of a long-term trend.\nRising unemployment for Black Americans may not be the only crack in the labor market data. Recent graduates have struggled to find work amid the rise of artificial intelligence and business uncertainty related to tariffs. And job gains this year have been concentrated in areas like health care, leisure and hospitality, and among state and local governments.\nOverall, U.S. employers added just 73,000 jobs in July, below the 105,000 economists expected.\n\"The labor market is slowing down,\" Ajilore said. \"It's one of those things where looking at Black unemployment rate and Black labor market indicators told us this story was coming.\"\nContributing: Jessica Guynn and Jayme Fraser"

      "text": "What's next for DOGE after Trump's alliance with Musk collapsed\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump says the work of the Department of Government Efficiency is \"not finished at all\" after his relationship Elon Musk blew up in spectacular fashion.\nYet whether the government-slashing DOGE will pack the same punch now that the world's richest man not only left the White House, but turned on Trump in an epic public battle, is unclear.\nThe future of DOGE was already in limbo after Musk's four-month run as the chainsaw-wielding DOGE leader ended, especially because several other top DOGE officials exited the Trump administration alongside Musk. But then came Musk's war of words last week with Trump that ended their political alliance.\nHere's what we know about DOGE's direction in a post-Musk White House:\nTrump says DOGE will keep going minus Musk\nIn the aftermath of their fallout, Trump signaled that he's ready to move on from the Musk fight but not DOGE itself.\nThe president told reporters on June 6 he's \"not thinking about Elon\" and has no plans to ask him to return his honorary White House key. Trump added on June 9 that he's not getting rid of the red Tesla car he bought from Musk \u2012 but \"may move the Tesla around a little bit\" \u2012 and said he won't ditch Musk's Starlink internet service that was installed at the White House.\nTrump declined to take a shot at Musk when asked about the former White House adviser's alleged drug use and whether he believed Musk used drugs at the White House. \"I really don't know. I don't think so. I hope not,\" Trump said. \"We had a good relationship and I just wish him well \u2012 very well actually.\"\nFor his part, Musk appeared to take back some of his harshest attacks, deleting a post he made on X endorsing Trump's impeachment and another alleging Trump is mentioned in undisclosed classified files related to the financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nTrump reiterated that in the wake of recent departures, the work of DOGE, which has executed widespread cuts throughout the federal government, isn't over.\n\"We saved hundreds of billions of dollars \u2012 it's terrific. And it's going further,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on June 6.\nOthers out at DOGE\nFor four months, DOGE rapidly fanned throughout the federal government, seizing control of information technology infrastructure, axing federal government contracts, gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development and pushing out or firing tens of thousands of federal employees.\nDOGE is set to continue operations until the summer of 2026 under an executive order Trump signed in January. But without Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, at the helm, it's unclear if DOGE will operate with the same slash-and-burn aggressiveness.\nAt its peak, the quasi-official agency employed more than 100 computer engineers, budget analysts and other staffers \u2012 some working at the group's offices at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House campus and others inside various agencies and departments.\nAmong the other top DOGE employees to follow were Steve Davis, Musk's top lieutenant who oversaw DOGE's day-to-day operations, publicist Katie Miller and DOGE's top attorney James Burnham. Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, has continued to work for Musk.\nMusk's exit as the DOGE leader came as his designation as a \"special government employee\" \u2012 which allowed him to stay on the job for 130 calendar days a year \u2012 ended. Others in DOGE's top brass were working under the same structure.\nBefore Musk began to criticize Trump's tax and policy megabill publicly, he asked for his special government employee status to be extended beyond 130 days to allow him to continue to lead DOGE, but the White House declined, a source told USA TODAY.\nRuss Vought takes on slashing role post-Musk\nThe White House has said no individual person will replace Musk, noting that several DOGE employees have \"onboarded\" as political appointees at the various agencies they've worked to overhaul.\n\u201cThe mission of eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse is a part of the DNA of the federal government,\" Harrison Fields, White House deputy press secretary, said in a statement to USA TODAY, \"and will continue under the direction of the President, his Cabinet, and agency heads to enhance government efficiency and prioritize responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.\"\nRuss Vought, Trump's director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, has started to fill Musk's void as the top Trump official carrying out DOGE's stated mission of cutting government \"waste, fraud and abuse.\"\nVought, who also led OMB in Trump's first term, wrote the chapter on executive power in Project 2025, the controversial policy blueprint created by the conservative Heritage Foundation that Trump distanced himself from during the 2024 campaign. Vought uses a lot of the same language as Musk, writing in Project 2025 that the goal should be to \"bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will.\"\nVought, however, isn't calling himself the DOGE leader. Appearing June 4 before the House Appropriations Committee, Vought said the \"Cabinet agencies that are in charge of the DOGE consultants that work for them are fundamentally in control of DOGE.\"\nRep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisconsin, wasn't pleased with Vought's answer. \"Oh, that's an answer only a mother could love,\" he said.\nWhite House, GOP leaders look to codify DOGE cuts\nLeading up to the Trump-Musk breakup, the business mogul started leveling criticism over the trillions of dollars that Trump's massive tax and spending bill is projected to add to the deficit.\nIn an appeal to Republican fiscal hawks, the White House and House Speaker Mike Johnson have said they want to codify the DOGE cuts, beginning this week when they hope to formally claw back $9.4 billion in spending.\nThe rescissions package, set for a House vote on June 12, will include $8.3 billion in cuts to foreign aid and $1.1 billion from public broadcasting funds, including for NPR and PBS.\nRepublican leadership is bullish that they can get the package quickly passed. They have 45 days to approve it, and it only requires a majority vote in the Senate.\nBut it may not be so simple: Several lawmakers have concerns with the rollback of a Bush-era program to support AIDS prevention and with the impact on rural communities that rely on public media for information.\nVought has said future legislative packages to enact DOGE cuts could come later if the initial rescissions package passes.\nMusk left White House with DOGE goals unmet\nMusk left the White House after falling vastly short of his ambitious cost-savings goal for the federal government.\nMusk had set a goal for DOGE to cut $1 trillion from the federal government by the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. He had even talked about $2 trillion in cuts on the 2024 campaign trail when he stumped for Trump.\nBut DOGE's savings total posted on its website currently stands at $180 billion, which doesn't amount to even 20% of $1 trillion. And this does not even factor in potential exaggerations or errors in DOGE's calculations, which have been a recurring theme in the group's declared savings.\n\"I did not find the federal government to be rife with waste, fraud and abuse. I was expecting some more easy wins,\" Sahil Lavingia, a former DOGE engineer, said in an interview with National Public Radio.\nLavingia added that he believed DOGE had produced many examples of government \"waste\" but disagreed that DOGE uncovered mountains of \"fraud and abuse\" as Musk claimed.\n\"The government has been under sort of a magnifying glass for decades,\" Lavingia said. \"And so I think, generally, I personally was pretty surprised, actually, at how efficient the government was. This isn't to say that it can't be made more efficient.\"\nDOGE rehiring some terminated workers\nBefore he left, Musk said DOGE's next focus will be on fixing the federal government's aging computer systems \u2012 something far less controversial than taking a battering ram to the federal workforce.\nIn the meantime, some federal agencies and departments are doing cleanup work to repatch holes left by the mass exodus of federal worker departures steered by DOGE.\nThe National Science Foundation said it was reinstating several dozen employees following a May federal court ruling that found the mass cuts by DOGE were unlawfully forced by the Office of Personnel Management.\nThe Washington Post reported that several agencies, including the IRS, Food and Drug Administration, and even USAID, are also scrambling to rehire many of the probationary employees fired under DOGE's direction and bring back longtime federal workers who accepted voluntary buyouts.\nContributing: Riley Beggin\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "In win for Trump, Supreme Court lets DOGE access Social Security data\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A divided Supreme Court on June 6 said Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency can have complete access to the data of millions of Americans kept by the U.S. Social Security Administration.\nThe court paused a judge\u2019s order blocking DOGE from immediately getting broad access to the data which includes Social Security numbers, medical and mental health information, tax return information and citizenship records.\nThe court's three liberal justices \u2212 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2212 disagreed with that decision.\n\"The Government wants to give DOGE unfettered access to this personal, non-anonymized information right now \u2014before the courts have time to assess whether DOGE\u2019s access is lawful,\" Jackson wrote in a dissent joined by Sotomayor. \"In essence, the `urgency' underlying the Government's stay application is the mere fact that it cannot be bothered to wait for the litigation process to play out before proceeding as it wishes.\"\nJackson said the court has \"truly lost its moorings\" when deciding what's worthy of emergency intervention and may be showing preferential treatment for the administration.\n\"It says, in essence, that although other stay applicants must point to more than the annoyance of compliance with lower court orders they don't like,\" she wrote, \"the Government can approach the courtroom bar with nothing more than that and obtain relief from this Court nevertheless.\"\nIn a brief and unsigned decision, the majority said access is warranted now because the courts are likely to ultimately decide that DOGE can have the information. A delay would harm the administration's reorganization efforts and not be in the public's interest, the majority wrote.\nIn March, U.S. District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander of Maryland said DOGE was intruding on \"the personal affairs of millions of Americans\" in a fishing expedition that\u2019s based on little more than suspicion.\u201d\nHollander limited DOGE\u2019s access to the information while the courts assess the legality of the Trump administration\u2019s actions.\nThe administration argued the judge overstepped, viewing DOGE staffers as the equivalent of intruders breaking into hotel rooms rather than as employees trying to modernize the agency's technology and root out waste \u2013 as DOGE officials said they intended to do.\n\u201cDistrict courts should not be able to wield the Privacy Act to substitute their own view of the government\u2019s 'needs\u2019 for that of the President and agency heads,\u201d Solicitor General John Sauer told the Supreme Court in an emergency appeal.\nDOGE has sought access to multiple agencies as part of its mission to hunt for wasteful spending and dramatically overhaul the federal government.\nMusk has falsely claimed that millions of Americans who are deceased are still receiving Social Security checks.\nTwo labor unions and an advocacy group sued the SSA after DOGE began digging into personal data.\nThey told the Supreme Court justices they shouldn\u2019t intervene because the administration hadn't shown an emergency need to access data beyond what the district judge allowed.\nIn addition to overseeing Social Security benefits for retirees and disabled people, the Social Security Administration helps administer programs run by other agencies, including Medicare and Medicaid.\nA divided federal appeals court on April 30 rejected the Trump administration\u2019s request to block the district judge\u2019s order.\nU.S. Circuit Judge Robert King of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Richmond, Virginia, said the government hadn\u2019t shown a need for unfettered access to the highly sensitive personal information that the American people had every reason to believe would be \u201cfiercely protected.\u201d\nDOGE\u2019s mission can be largely accomplished through anonymized and redacted data, which is the usual way the agency has handled technology upgrades and fraud detection, he wrote."

      "text": "Despite DOGE, Pentagon escapes Donald Trump's budget cuts unscathed\nThe defense budget request is the biggest in U.S. history.\nWASHINGTON \u2212 In February, before President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's very public feud, the president bragged his ally would find \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse\" in the Defense Department budget.\nLess than five months later, the Pentagon formally announced the country's first-ever $1 trillion defense budget proposal for fiscal year 2026, eclipsing the previous year's enacted total by more than $100 billion. The direct \"savings from DOGE collaboration\" touted in the Defense Department's budget rollout? Only $6 billion.\nAlthough Congress must legislate and approve the full budget, an initial tranche of the fiscal 2026 funding \u2212 $119.3 billion of the $1.01 trillion \u2212 for the Defense Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration will likely arrive via Trump's tax and spending package, which he has dubbed \"one, big beautiful bill.\" The administration staked key portions of the defense budget on Trump's megabill, which includes controversial conservative policy priorities.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth argued before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the budget is needed to \"end four years of chronic underinvestment in our military.\"\nFormer President Joe Biden requested increased levels of defense spending, but congressional Republicans asked for even more. A DOD spokesperson told USA TODAY that Hegseth continues to review programs for cuts or further reallocations.\nThe Pentagon and NNSA spending boost contrasts with major cuts to other programs sought by the administration and the Republican majority in Congress. The reconciliation megabill, which passed the Senate on July 1, must again win House approval before it goes to Trump for his signature. (The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\nOver the next decade, the reconciliation bill would cut $1 trillion from Medicaid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office; $300 billion from food stamps; and hundreds of billions more from clean energy programs.\nForeign aid and education programs are on the chopping block in the main budget, which Congress has not yet started deliberating.\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers, R-Alabama, said the defense spending boost in the reconciliation bill is \"needed to restore American deterrence, revitalize the defense industrial base, and modernize our military.\"\nFigures on both sides of the political spectrum, including Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon, have expressed frustration over the defense budget's continued growth.\n\"You can't talk about fraud and waste and abuse in this town unless you're gonna go to the Pentagon,\" Bannon said in an April 24 podcast. \"And you know what's happened since [DOGE] went over there? Crickets ... The system we have is not sustainable.\"\nWilliam Hartung, a defense spending expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, told USA TODAY the Pentagon's rushed budget rollout omitted key documents detailing \"the nuts and bolts\" of its funding requests.\n\"It makes it very hard to analyze ... their priorities,\" Hartung said. \"(There's) a lot missing if you're a member of Congress trying to evaluate this.\"\nThat could leave lawmakers and analysts flying blind during the hurried reconciliation bill negotiations. Trump has pushed congressional Republicans to have the legislation on his desk by July 4.\nHartung argued that spending more on defense doesn't necessarily mean better results because Congress often spends money based on what congressional district or state will receive the work rather than how the proposal aligns with U.S. strategy.\nFormer Democratic Rep. John Tierney, who now heads the Council for a Livable World and Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation nonprofits, said he believes the political climate discourages lawmakers of both parties from questioning defense spending.\n\"There's not a lot of thought about what the strategy is,\" Tierney added.\nNuclear modernization, missile defense garner billions\nAccording to the Pentagon, about $85 billion of the proposed defense budget would go toward U.S. nuclear capabilities and Trump's Golden Dome missile defense initiative. Much of the funding would go toward America's triad of nuclear-armed bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear submarines whose replacements are the centerpieces of a broader $1.7 trillion nuclear modernization campaign.\nHartung emphasized the Pentagon and NNSA's poor track record of keeping such protects on-time and on-budget.\nThe Government Accountability Office estimated in June that the full cost of developing and deploying the Sentinel ICBM, slated to replace the Minuteman III missiles that have remained on watch since 1970, will balloon to \"approximately $170 billion\" after the Air Force realized the new missiles could not use legacy Minuteman III silos.\n\"This project is totally out of control,\" Tierney said.\nThe administration wants the restructured Sentinel program to receive $4.5 billion in fiscal 2026, according to budget documents. New silos are not included in that figure.\nThe NNSA, which designs, builds and maintains the country's nuclear warheads, is in line to receive a $5.56 billion (or nearly 30%) boost in funding for its Weapons Activities division compared with last year.\nThe agency is struggling to hit its timeline and cost goals for reestablishing mass production of nuclear warheads' explosive cores, known as plutonium pits.\nA USA TODAY investigation in May detailed the NNSA's decadeslong battle to secure enough federal employees with adequate technical backgrounds to oversee the agency's complex and sprawling projects. Government watchdogs have consistently highlighted staffing problems as an Achilles' heel for the agency.\nNNSA's fiscal 2026 budget request does not include significant funding for additional federal employees, despite agency leaders testifying to Congress on May 20 about their scramble to address DOGE-created vacancies amid a near-total hiring freeze.\nThe NNSA funding boost \"is a recipe for wasting money,\" Hartung said.\nDavis Winkie's role covering nuclear threats and national security at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Outrider Foundation and Journalism Funding Partners.

It now heads to the Senate.\n\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk said.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.\n\u201cI think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion,\u201d Musk said in the interview.\nMusk, the richest man in the world and a Republican mega-donor who helped bankroll Trump's 2024 campaign, said he intends to substantially cut back his political spending in future elections as he shifts his attention to his business empire.\n\"I think in terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,\" Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said on May 20 at the Bloomberg News Qatar Economic Forum. \"I think I've done enough.\"\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

He and others including Steve Davis, a key Musk aide who ran DOGE\u2019s day-to-day operations, have left the government, according to a White House official.\nIn March, Reuters reported that Coristine had provided tech support to a cybercrime gang that had bragged about trafficking in stolen data and harassing an FBI agent.\nThe DOGE departures came after Musk\u2019s split with Trump over government spending. Musk had initially aimed to cut $2 trillion in federal spending but DOGE recommendations resulted in about $150 billion in cuts that lawmakers are now debating whether to make permanent.\nMusk, who served in a special White House post that ended May 30, became sharply critical of Trump\u2019s package of legislative priorities that congressional agencies have said will raise deficit spending and the national debt.\nMusk has since said he \"went too far\" in criticism that included calling the legislative package an abomination and suggesting that Trump was mentioned in secret criminal files of the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The White House has denied Trump was associated with Epstein.\nTrump and officials such as Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, who has taken over leadership of DOGE, have argued the tax-and-spending package the Senate is debating this week won\u2019t add to the debt because of anticipated economic growth."

Angus King, I-Maine, if a hiring freeze, resignations and attrition could bring \u201csome pretty important vacancies,\u201d acting National Nuclear Security Agency defense programs head David Hoagland said, \u201cThat\u2019s very true.\u201d Hoagland said at the May 20 hearing that his office had \"shifted people around\" to meet \"critical needs.\"\nHundreds of NNSA staff were fired by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year, amid a $1.7 trillion nuclear weapons upgrade, in a chaotic wave of layoffs. Most were later rehired. Other critical staffers agreed to leave their jobs under DOGE's \"fork in the road\" resignation offer.\nKing said NNSA claims that staffing shortages hadn't placed agency's mission at short term risk \"strikes me as implausible.\"\nThe NNSA struggled with staffing and talent pipeline issues for decades before the new Trump administration, a recent USA TODAY investigation found. Then Musk launched efforts to reduce the federal workforce, which further destabilized the NNSA workforce, experts said.\nThe agency currently faces a near-total hiring freeze and lost more than 130 of its 2,000 federal employees to the DOGE deferred resignation program. More than 300 more employees were fired and reinstated in February damaging morale.\nNNSA's acting principal deputy administrator, James McConnell, said told senators on a subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee the agency could handle the losses \u201cin the short term,\u201d but he said the NNSA needs to \u201cmake sure that our resources are adequate.\u201d\nExperts told USA TODAY sustained staffing shortages could cause further delays and cost overruns on the agency's beleaguered portions of the nation's broader $1.7 trillion nuclear arsenal modernization effort. USA TODAY documented billions of dollars in overruns, as well as safety issues, at NNSA facilities that were attributed to staffing shortages.\nMarv Adams, Hoagland's Senate-confirmed predecessor atop NNSA's defense programs, said in an interview that during his tenure, \"our federal [warhead] program offices struggled to keep up and not get behind because of understaffing.\"\nThe agency's field offices faced similar strain, according to David Bowman, a retired civil servant and former manager of the NNSA's Nevada Field Office. From 2020 until his retirement in the fall of 2024, Bowman oversaw operations at the expansive Nevada National Security Site.\nNNSA field offices must review and approve much of the work the agency's massive contractor workforce does on the nuclear arsenal, as well as safety management plans. In an interview, Bowman said such review \"requires ... technical experts who are feds.\"\n\"If the field offices or the safety experts are short staffed, the work is going to back up,\" he said.\nBowman described finding qualified staff for his far-flung office northwest of Las Vegas as \"the big challenge we had.\"\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman, USA TODAY\nIf you're a current or former NNSA employee willing to inform USA TODAY's coverage of the agency, please contact Davis Winkie via email at dwinkie@usatoday.com or via the Signal encrypted messaging app at 770-539-3257.
