On the other hand, employers also seem uninterested in hiring.\n\nThat means that even a relatively minor uptick in job cuts could mean greater losses, the report added, and that process can be tough to halt once it gets going.\n\nIt\u2019s because of this fear, WSJ added, that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has signaled a possible interest rate cut even with inflation above the central bank\u2019s 2% target.\n\nIn a speech last week, Powell characterized the employment landscape as \u201ccurious,\u201d with the reduced supply of workers because of immigration restrictions offsetting the effects of reduced demand, leaving unemployment relatively low as a result. All the same, Powell said the risks of a deteriorating jobs market are increasing.\n\n\u201cAnd if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nDepartment of Labor data from earlier this month shows that the number of Americans who have filed a continued claim for unemployment benefits has reached its highest level in almost four years.\n\nUnemployment beneficiaries came to 1,972,000 during the week ended Aug. 9, a figure that was 30,000 higher than the prior week and the highest since the 2,041,000 recorded on Nov. 6, 2021, the department said last week.\n\nMeanwhile, recent data from the Conference Board shows that 20% of American employers plan to hire fewer workers this year, nearly double the rate of companies that intended to slow hiring at this point last year.\n\nBusinesses are \u201ctaking a more thoughtful, steady approach as economic and policy uncertainty lingers,\u201d Diana Scott, leader of board\u2019s U.S. Human Capital Center, told WSJ.\n\nAt the same time, research by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that some businesses are feeling renewed confidence in the face of economic uncertainty.\n\nFor example, surveys of micro businesses taken in February and March found that 68% of these companies were optimistic about their chances of surviving the next two years. By June, that figure had climbed to 75%.",

      "text": "One the one hand, the current administration\u2019s shifting tariffs on imported goods and commodities ranging from Swiss watches and Brazilian coffee to Canadian aluminum and steel are a blow to companies reliant on those items. Unless they pivot on sourcing or cut expenses elsewhere, somebody has to eat those costs. and 70% of tariff-related costs will be passed on to shoppers through higher prices, Goldman Sachs assumes. Right now, consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate of 18.3%, the highest since 1934, according to the Yale Budget Lab, equivalent to an average household income loss of $2,400.\nOn the other hand, America\u2019s smaller businesses are feeling newly chipper.\nAs of early June, more than 8 in 10 small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) were confident in their ability to remain operational two years from now, a recent PYMNTS Intelligence report found. This data point, captured in an early-June survey detailed in \u201cSmall Business Growth Monitor Q2 2025: From Headwinds to Hope on Main Street,\u201d marks the highest share since PYMNTS Intelligence began tracking business sentiment over three years ago, in July 2022.\nEven more striking: Small business confidence spiked at a time when uncertainty about the Trump administration\u2019s flip-flop approach to global trade swelled with off-again, on-again levies and start-and-stop negotiations with major trading partners. Just four months prior in early February, before the April \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs were announced and other \u201creciprocal\u201d duties hadn\u2019t yet emerged, nearly 1 in 5 smaller businesses were pessimistic about their survival. Almost 7% thought they might not make it.\nBut by early June, the picture was a lot brighter, with only 5.3% deeming survival unlikely. Even the tiniest firms, micro-SMBs with annual revenues under $150,000, are riding this new wave of optimism, with 3 in 4 indicating they are very or extremely likely to survive the next two years \u2014 a solid increase from 68% in March and February.\nConfidence With Tripwires\nTo be sure, it\u2019s not all puppies and rainbows.\nMid-sized businesses with annual revenues between $150,000 and $1 million saw a slight decrease in confidence in June compared to March, when the second-most recent survey was conducted. Industries like construction and utilities, along with independent retailers, are generally seeing improved financial health, while hospitality businesses are struggling the most.\nBut while micro SMBs pulled overall confidence up, 14% reported being worse off financially than six months ago, double the rate of high-revenue SMBs. These smallest firms are typically disproportionately affected by rising costs for imported goods or services, poor cash flow and late customer payments.\nThere\u2019s more. Just over 8 in 10 small business owners who applied for a business loan or line of credit within the last year found it difficult to access affordable capital, a Goldman Sachs report said in June.\nForces at Play\nThe big mystery is, with the economic headwinds, why are many of America\u2019s small businesses newly optimistic? Several factors are at play.\nFirst, consumers. They\u2019re not locking up their pocketbooks, at least not yet. Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows that they nudged up their spending by 0.3% in June, mostly on food, beverages, clothing and shoes, and recreational goods. That slight increase, after flat spending in May, coincided with an equal rise in disposable income. When money came in the door, people spent it, both on essential categories and discretionary items related to experiences and personal care (areas where many small businesses, like nail salons and summer camps, excel). Four in 10 SMBs reported benefiting from rising demand, the PYMNTS Intelligence report shows.\nNext, business boot-strapping. The report found that larger SMBs saw gains from introducing new products and services and from efficiency-boosting technology upgrades. Meanwhile, the smallest firms were more likely to emphasize better marketing and customer outreach.\nNext, competitive advantages. Andrew Clarke, the president and founder of Ground Floor Partners, a small business consulting firm in Chicago, said Thursday that some of his clients in construction, plumbing and electrical services had kept their prices higher than the competition for years because they can justify that by offering better customer service. If their costs rise due to tariffs, he said, \u201cthey just can reduce their margins\u201d and still do well.\nThen there\u2019s Uncle Sam. In July, the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d made a lucrative tax deduction enjoyed by many small businesses and self-employed individuals permanent (it was due to end on Dec. 31). It also increased the deduction starting next year and made it easier to qualify for. While that legislation came after the June survey days, small business likely already knew it was in the works, after the Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved a permanent, expanded deduction in May, making blessing by the Republican-controlled Senate in July a slam dunk.\nThe deduction allows small business owners to deduct up to 20% of their \u201cqualified,\u201d meaning core, business income, which reduces their taxable income and thus what they owe to the Internal Revenue Service. Starting next year, they can deduct 23%.\nPayment Industry Dividend\nFor the payments industry, the overall small business optimism is a good sign. When SMBs are ready to thrive and grow, they often invest in digital technologies: contactless payments, integrated online checkout, better point-of-sale systems and faster funding solutions. They look for partners who can offer flexible, secure and scalable payment methods. As businesses open new locations, launch eCommerce platforms or expand their service offerings, their need for seamless, cost-effective payments grows in lock step. That\u2019s the silver lining in the tariffs cloud.\nOf course, consumers will have to keep spending if small businesses are to grow their sales and merchant accounts and boost demand for their value-added services. And it\u2019s still early in the tariffs game to see how the levies might drive down consumption. Still, the current sentiment suggests an opportunity to support these businesses, not just with payment processing, but with broader tools including analytics, financing and fraud protection.\n\u201cSmall businesses are no strangers to adversity \u2014 resilience is in their DNA,\u201d said Dave Charest, the director of small business success at Constant Contact, a digital marketing platform. \u201cWhat sets them apart is their ability to stay close to their customers, adapt quickly and deliver real value.\u201d"

      "text": "August 22, 2025\nMonetary Policy and the Fed\u2019s Framework Review\nChair Jerome H. Powell\nAt \u201cLabor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy,\u201d an economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming\nOver the course of this year, the U.S. economy has shown resilience in a context of sweeping changes in economic policy. In terms of the Fed's dual-mandate goals, the labor market remains near maximum employment, and inflation, though still somewhat elevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. At the same time, the balance of risks appears to be shifting.\nIn my remarks today, I will first address the current economic situation and the near-term outlook for monetary policy. I will then turn to the results of our second public review of our monetary policy framework, as captured in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we released today.\nCurrent Economic Conditions and Near-Term Outlook\nWhen I appeared at this podium one year ago, the economy was at an inflection point. Our policy rate had stood at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for more than a year. That restrictive policy stance was appropriate to help bring down inflation and to foster a sustainable balance between aggregate demand and supply. Inflation had moved much closer to our objective, and the labor market had cooled from its formerly overheated state. Upside risks to inflation had diminished. But the unemployment rate had increased by almost a full percentage point, a development that historically has not occurred outside of recessions.1 Over the subsequent three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, we recalibrated our policy stance, setting the stage for the labor market to remain in balance near maximum employment over the past year (figure 1).\nThis year, the economy has faced new challenges. Significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are remaking the global trading system. Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth. Over the longer run, changes in tax, spending, and regulatory policies may also have important implications for economic growth and productivity. There is significant uncertainty about where all of these polices will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be.\nChanges in trade and immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply. In this environment, distinguishing cyclical developments from trend, or structural, developments is difficult. This distinction is critical because monetary policy can work to stabilize cyclical fluctuations but can do little to alter structural changes.\nThe labor market is a case in point. The July employment report released earlier this month showed that payroll job growth slowed to an average pace of only 35,000 per month over the past three months, down from 168,000 per month during 2024 (figure 2).2 This slowdown is much larger than assessed just a month ago, as the earlier figures for May and June were revised down substantially.3 But it does not appear that the slowdown in job growth has opened up a large margin of slack in the labor market\u2014an outcome we want to avoid. The unemployment rate, while edging up in July, stands at a historically low level of 4.2 percent and has been broadly stable over the past year. Other indicators of labor market conditions are also little changed or have softened only modestly, including quits, layoffs, the ratio of vacancies to unemployment, and nominal wage growth. Labor supply has softened in line with demand, sharply lowering the \"breakeven\" rate of job creation needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. Indeed, labor force growth has slowed considerably this year with the sharp falloff in immigration, and the labor force participation rate has edged down in recent months.\nOverall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\nAt the same time, GDP growth has slowed notably in the first half of this year to a pace of 1.2 percent, roughly half the 2.5 percent pace in 2024 (figure 3). The decline in growth has largely reflected a slowdown in consumer spending. As with the labor market, some of the slowing in GDP likely reflects slower growth of supply or potential output.\nTurning to inflation, higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods. Estimates based on the latest available data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in July. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent, above their level a year ago. Within core, prices of goods increased 1.1 percent over the past 12 months, a notable shift from the modest decline seen over the course of 2024. In contrast, housing services inflation remains on a downward trend, and nonhousing services inflation is still running at a level a bit above what has been historically consistent with 2 percent inflation (figure 4).4\nThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether these price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem. A reasonable base case is that the effects will be relatively short lived\u2014a one-time shift in the price level. Of course, \"one-time\" does not mean \"all at once.\" It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks. Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\nIt is also possible, however, that the upward pressure on prices from tariffs could spur a more lasting inflation dynamic, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed. One possibility is that workers, who see their real incomes decline because of higher prices, demand and get higher wages from employers, setting off adverse wage\u2013price dynamics. Given that the labor market is not particularly tight and faces increasing downside risks, that outcome does not seem likely.\nAnother possibility is that inflation expectations could move up, dragging actual inflation with them. Inflation has been above our target for more than four years and remains a prominent concern for households and businesses. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations, however, as reflected in market- and survey-based measures, appear to remain well anchored and consistent with our longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent.\nOf course, we cannot take the stability of inflation expectations for granted. Come what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem.\nPutting the pieces together, what are the implications for monetary policy? In the near term, risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment to the downside\u2014a challenging situation. When our goals are in tension like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. Our policy rate is now 100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance. Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\nMonetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach.\nEvolution of Monetary Policy Framework\nTurning to my second topic, our monetary policy framework is built on the unchanging foundation of our mandate from Congress to foster maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We remain fully committed to fulfilling our statutory mandate, and the revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions. Our revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we refer to as our consensus statement, describes how we pursue our dual-mandate goals. It is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy, and that understanding is important both for transparency and accountability, and for making monetary policy more effective.\nThe changes we made in this review are a natural progression, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. We continue to build upon the initial consensus statement adopted in 2012 under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. Today's revised statement is the outcome of the second public review of our framework, which we conduct at five-year intervals. This year's review included three elements: Fed Listens events at Reserve Banks around the country, a flagship research conference, and policymaker discussions and deliberations, supported by staff analysis, at a series of FOMC meetings.5\nIn approaching this year's review, a key objective has been to make sure that our framework is suitable across a broad range of economic conditions. At the same time, the framework needs to evolve with changes in the structure of the economy and our understanding of those changes. The Great Depression presented different challenges from those of the Great Inflation and the Great Moderation, which in turn are different from the ones we face today.6\nAt the time of the last review, we were living in a new normal, characterized by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound (ELB), along with low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve\u2014meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy.7 To me, a statistic that captures that era is that our policy rate was stuck at the ELB for seven long years following the onset of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in late 2008. Many here will recall the sluggish growth and painfully slow recovery of that era. It appeared highly likely that if the economy experienced even a mild downturn, our policy rate would be back at the ELB very quickly, probably for another extended period. Inflation and inflation expectations could then decline in a weak economy, raising real interest rates as nominal rates were pinned near zero. Higher real rates would further weigh on job growth and reinforce the downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations, triggering an adverse dynamic.\nThe economic conditions that brought the policy rate to the ELB and drove the 2020 framework changes were thought to be rooted in slow-moving global factors that would persist for an extended period\u2014and might well have done so, if not for the pandemic.8 The 2020 consensus statement included several features that addressed the ELB-related risks that had become increasingly prominent over the preceding two decades. We emphasized the importance of anchored longer-term inflation expectations to support both our price-stability and maximum-employment goals. Drawing on an extensive literature on strategies to mitigate risks associated with the ELB, we adopted flexible average inflation targeting\u2014a \"makeup\" strategy to ensure that inflation expectations would remain well anchored even with the ELB constraint.9 In particular, we said that, following periods when inflation had been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\nIn the event, rather than low inflation and the ELB, the post-pandemic reopening brought the highest inflation in 40 years to economies around the world. Like most other central banks and private-sector analysts, through year-end 2021 we thought that inflation would subside fairly quickly without a sharp tightening in our policy stance (figure 5).10 When it became clear that this was not the case, we responded forcefully, raising our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points over 16 months. That action, combined with the unwinding of pandemic supply disruptions, contributed to inflation moving much closer to our target without the painful rise in unemployment that has accompanied previous efforts to counter high inflation.\nElements of the Revised Consensus Statement\nThis year's review considered how economic conditions have evolved over the past five years. During this period, we saw that the inflation situation can change rapidly in the face of large shocks. In addition, interest rates are now substantially higher than was the case during the era between the GFC and the pandemic. With inflation above target, our policy rate is restrictive\u2014modestly so, in my view. We cannot say for certain where rates will settle out over the longer run, but their neutral level may now be higher than during the 2010s, reflecting changes in productivity, demographics, fiscal policy, and other factors that affect the balance between saving and investment (figure 6). During the review, we discussed how the 2020 statement's focus on the ELB may have complicated communications about our response to high inflation. We concluded that the emphasis on an overly specific set of economic conditions may have led to some confusion, and, as a result, we made several important changes to the consensus statement to reflect that insight.\nFirst, we removed language indicating that the ELB was a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, we noted that our \"monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions.\" The difficulty of operating near the ELB remains a potential concern, but it is not our primary focus. The revised statement reiterates that the Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum-employment and price-stability goals, particularly if the federal funds rate is constrained by the ELB.\nSecond, we returned to a framework of flexible inflation targeting and eliminated the \"makeup\" strategy. As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021.11\nWell-anchored inflation expectations were critical to our success in bringing down inflation without a sharp increase in unemployment. Anchored expectations promote the return of inflation to target when adverse shocks drive inflation higher, and limit the risk of deflation when the economy weakens.12 Further, they allow monetary policy to support maximum employment in economic downturns without compromising price stability. Our revised statement emphasizes our commitment to act forcefully to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, to the benefit of both sides of our dual mandate. It also notes that \"price stability is essential for a sound and stable economy and supports the well-being of all Americans.\" This theme came through loud and clear at our Fed Listens events.13 The past five years have been a painful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of necessities.\nThird, our 2020 statement said that we would mitigate \"shortfalls,\" rather than \"deviations,\" from maximum employment. The use of \"shortfalls\" reflected the insight that our real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment\u2014and hence of \"maximum employment\"\u2014are highly uncertain.14 The later years of the post-GFC recovery featured employment running for an extended period above mainstream estimates of its sustainable level, along with inflation running persistently below our 2 percent target. In the absence of inflationary pressures, it might not be necessary to tighten policy based solely on uncertain real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.15\nWe still have that view, but our use of the term \"shortfalls\" was not always interpreted as intended, raising communications challenges. In particular, the use of \"shortfalls\" was not intended as a commitment to permanently forswear preemption or to ignore labor market tightness. Accordingly, we removed \"shortfalls\" from our statement. Instead, the revised document now states more precisely that \"the Committee recognizes that employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without necessarily creating risks to price stability.\" Of course, preemptive action would likely be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price stability.\nThe revised statement also notes that maximum employment is \"the highest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability.\" This focus on promoting a strong labor market underscores the principle that \"durably achieving maximum employment fosters broad-based economic opportunities and benefits for all Americans.\" The feedback we received at Fed Listens events reinforced the value of a strong labor market for American households, employers, and communities.\nFourth, consistent with the removal of \"shortfalls,\" we made changes to clarify our approach in periods when our employment and inflation objectives are not complementary. In those circumstances, we will follow a balanced approach in promoting them. The revised statement now more closely aligns with the original 2012 language. We take into account the extent of departures from our goals and the potentially different time horizons over which each is projected to return to a level consistent with our dual mandate. These principles guide our policy decisions today, as they did over the 2022\u201324 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.\nIn addition to these changes, there is a great deal of continuity with past statements. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. For this reason, our policy actions depend on the economic outlook and the balance of risks to that outlook. We continue to believe that setting a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.\nWe also continue to view a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent as most consistent with our dual-mandate goals. We believe that our commitment to this target is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Experience has shown that 2 percent inflation is low enough to ensure that inflation is not a concern in household and business decisionmaking while also providing a central bank with some policy flexibility to provide accommodation during economic downturns.\nFinally, the revised consensus statement retained our commitment to conduct a public review roughly every five years. There is nothing magic about a five-year pace. That frequency allows policymakers to reassess structural features of the economy and to engage with the public, practitioners, and academics on the performance of our framework. It is also consistent with several global peers.\nConclusion\nIn closing, I want to thank President Schmid and all his staff who work so diligently to host this outstanding event annually. Counting a couple of virtual appearances during the pandemic, this is the eighth time I have had the honor to speak from this podium. Each year, this symposium offers the opportunity for Federal Reserve leaders to hear ideas from leading economic thinkers and focus on the challenges we face. The Kansas City Fed was wise to lure Chair Volcker to this national park more than 40 years ago, and I am proud to be part of that tradition.\n1. For example, after the July 2024 employment report, the 3-month average of the unemployment rate had increased more than 0.5 percentage point above its lowest value over the previous 12 months.

In early September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish a preliminary estimate of benchmark revisions to the level of nonfarm payrolls as of March 2025, based on data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. Data available to date suggest that the level of nonfarm payrolls will be revised down materially. The final benchmark revision will be incorporated into the monthly employment data in February 2026.

The total downward revision of 258,000 between May and June was spread across private-sector industries as well as state and local government employment, particularly education, and reflected both additional information from surveyed establishments and the re-estimation of seasonal factors.

Using the consumer price index and other information, an estimate of the contribution of housing services to 12-month core PCE inflation in July was 0.7 percentage point, while core services excluding housing contributed 2.0 percentage points. The contribution from each of these categories remains slightly above its average during the 2002\u201307 period, during which core PCE inflation averaged about 2 percent. In contrast, the contribution of core goods to 12-month core PCE inflation in July was about 0.25 percentage point, compared with the 2002\u201307 average of \u22120.25 percentage point.

      "text": "Even amid broad economic uncertainty due to the Trump administration\u2019s global trade agenda, many small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the United States are now feeling good about their near-term future. More than eight in 10 said in early June that they expect to still be in operation two years from now, the highest share since PYMNTS Intelligence began tracking business confidence just over three years ago. It\u2019s a significant shift from only four months ago. In early February, when global tariffs were in the air but the April \u201cLiberation Day\u201d levies regime hadn\u2019t yet unfolded, nearly one in five smaller businesses were pessimistic about their odds of survival. Nearly 7% said they might not make it. By early June, just 5.3% said it was likely they won\u2019t survive.\nBut the newly rosier outlook isn\u2019t spread evenly across all businesses. Much depends on a business\u2019s size and industry. Construction and utilities firms, as well as independent retailers, are by and large seeing improved financial health. While the smallest and largest of SMBs are feeling more optimistic, mid-sized businesses (those with annual revenues between $150,000 and $1 million) saw a slight decrease in confidence in June compared to prior months. Hospitality businesses, including hotels and restaurants, are struggling the most.\nA recent, small boost in consumer spending may have helped business outlooks.\nThe fresh data comes as consumers slightly boosted their spending in June by 0.3%, Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows. The increase, driven by slightly more purchases of food, beverages, apparel and recreational goods, came alongside an identical-sized uptick in disposable income. It seems that as consumers weather economic uncertainty and maintain their spending in certain categories, particularly essentials and discretionary items related to experiences and personal care, some SMBs are showing resilience amid widespread uncertainty about the economy and consumer spending.\nMore positive outlook notwithstanding, things are far from uniformly smooth sailing. Rising costs of imported goods, services and labor pose challenges, hurting some SMBs\u2019 financial health.\nThese are just some of the findings detailed in \u201cSmall Business Growth Monitor Q2 2025: From Headwinds to Hope on Main Street,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence exclusive report. This edition examines the current financial health of SMBs and their future expectations. It draws on insights from a survey of 513 SMBs conducted from June 2, 2025, to June 17, 2025.\nSMBs Are More Optimistic Than Ever About Their Long-Term Survival\nSmall businesses are the backbone of the American economy, with nearly 35 million driving close to half (43.5%) of U.S. GDP, Small Business Administration data shows. As independent retailers, accounting firms, mom-and-pop restaurants, local construction firms and the like, so goes the nation\u2019s financial health, making the sector a bellwether of consumer spending and economic growth.\nSMBs are more optimistic about their future than they\u2019ve been in three years. As of early June, the vast majority\u201482%\u2014expected to be still operating two years from now. This marks the highest share on record since PYMNTS Intelligence began tracking SMB sentiment in July 2022. It is also a significant uptick from the 76% who said this in early February. Additionally, 12% now believe it is only somewhat likely that they will survive the next two years, compared to 17% in the February survey. Just 5.3% now say they are only slightly or not at all likely to survive, compared to 6.9% in the February survey. It seems that, for the time being, SMBs are feeling better about their prospects.\nA significant component of the recent rise in confidence is the micro-SMB segment\u2014businesses with $150,000 or less in annual revenue. Among these tiny companies, three in four say they are very or extremely likely to survive the next two years. While this share is smaller than that of larger SMBs, it marks a solid increase from 68% in both March and February. Among large SMBs with revenues exceeding $1 million, the confidence share held flat at 91%.\nBy contrast, medium-sized SMBs with revenues between $150,000 and $1 million saw a slight decrease in optimism. The share reporting high levels of confidence fell to 83% in June from 87% in March.\nGrowing Demand, Cost-Control Measures and Savvy Marketing Strategies Are Fueling SMBs\u2019 Resilience\nBolstering this confidence, a range of variables is positively affecting SMBs\u2019 performance, from exogenous factors to the strategic decisions companies have recently made about their operations. For SMBs of all sizes, increased customer demand is the most common positive contributor. All told, 40% of SMBs say they are seeing benefits from rising demand. Consumers have recently stated that they may reduce their purchases of certain goods and services if tariffs, many of which took effect on Aug. 7, drive up inflation. But they have also indicated that they plan to stick to some of their discretionary spending, particularly on household and lifestyle items, personal care products and extracurricular activities for children\u2014areas where many small businesses, such as nail salons and summer camps, excel.\nOther favorable factors include reduced operating costs and more effective marketing.\nThe largest SMBs (those with more than $1 million in annual revenue) are the most likely to benefit from introducing new products and services and from efficiency-boosting technology upgrades. The smallest firms (with annual revenues of less than $150,000) are more likely to cite more effective marketing or customer outreach.\nIn general, an SMB\u2019s financial health is boosted by factors both within its control, such as internal technology upgrades and marketing, and outside its reins, such as the level of customer demand and improved supplier terms.\nDespite Widespread Confidence, Micro-SMBs Are Facing Cost and Cash Flow Challenges\nBut while micro-SMBs are increasingly optimistic, a few are the most likely to be facing declining financial health. Specifically, 14% report being worse off financially than they were six months earlier. This percentage is double the share of high-revenue SMBs that said the same.\nConstruction and utilities businesses report being the most financially stable. Nearly two in three said in June that they\u2019re doing better than they were six months ago. This share is 20% higher than the cross-industry average. Conversely, hospitality businesses such as hotels and restaurants are struggling the most. Nearly one in four is worse off than they were six months ago.\nRising costs for imported goods or for services, poor cash flow and late customer payments disproportionately affect micro-SMBs. Among firms with annual revenues less than $150,000, 38% say higher goods and service costs have negatively impacted them. This share is considerably higher than the three in 10 SMBs with revenues of more than $1 million that said the same. The gap may be due in part to smaller businesses having less negotiating power with suppliers favoring larger businesses. Additionally, 18% of micro-SMBs report being hurt by poor cash flow or late customer payments. This figure is twice the share of high-revenue SMBs that said the same.\nMeanwhile, the largest SMBs are now the hardest hit by rising labor costs and by supply chain disruptions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, wages and salaries in June were up 1% from three months prior. Nearly one in four SMBs are negatively impacted by labor cost inflation, vs. just 12% of micro-SMBs. Additionally, 15% are adversely affected by supply chain disruptions compared to just 8.6% of micro-SMBs.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the consumer trends driving innovation in consumer finance, digital payments and financial inclusion.

      "text": "A growing number of American companies plan to slow hiring in the latter half of this year.\nTwenty percent of employers say they\u2019ll bring on fewer workers this year, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday (Aug. 21), citing data from The Conference Board. That figure is almost twice the rate of companies that planned to slow hiring at this point in 2024.\nAccording to the report, the last time the survey found optimism among executives about hiring was the second quarter of 2023. Enthusiasm has fallen steadily since then, the WSJ adds, noting a series of hiring pauses, including one at Meta\u2019s AI team.\nCompanies are \u201ctaking a more thoughtful, steady approach as economic and policy uncertainty lingers,\u201d Diana Scott, leader of The Conference Board\u2019s U.S. Human Capital Center, told the news outlet.\nShe added that the slowdown is a sign of companies trying to do more with their existing staffing rather than making the major hiring moves they did several years ago.\nThe report argues that a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of changes is making executives cautious, including tariffs and workplace raids in industries that depend on immigrant labor. And companies continue to turn toward artificial intelligence (AI) to boost productivity and efficiency.\nThe Conference Board\u2019s CHRO Confidence Index for hiring expectations came to 54 in the second quarter, down from 59 in the same period last year.\nAccording to the report, it now takes the average worker 24 weeks to find new employment after losing their job, compared to five months in 2024. Last month\u2019s jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, while the number of long-term unemployed has been creeping up.\nMeanwhile, American workers continue to face financial fragility, according to recent PYMNTS Intelligence research.\nThe Paycheck-to-Paycheck Index came to a new high of 68.4% in May, showing that 684 out of every 1,000 Americans are spending their monthly income on essential expenses. In addition, nearly 1 in 4 Americans say they struggled to stay on top of their bills \u2014 a figure that has climbed up for each of the previous three months.\n\u201cThis environment fosters discomfort, as 6 in 10 consumers feel uneasy when contemplating their finances, and 24% admit to high anxiety, alongside 36% expressing some level of concern,\u201d PYMNTS wrote last month.\n\u201cWhile lower-income individuals predictably bear the brunt of this stress at 71%, even a portion of middle and high earners report worry, demonstrating a broad-based financial apprehension that transcends income brackets and generally impacts all age groups, with baby boomers being a slight exception.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "The U.S. labor market remains tight with low unemployment, yet hiring is slowing as firms adopt a cautious stance amid inflation, tariffs, and policy uncertainty, prompting a rise in continued unemployment claims and a potential Fed rate cut. Small and mid\u2011size businesses report growing optimism about their two\u2011year survival prospects, buoyed by modest consumer spending and strategic cost controls, though micro\u2011SMBs face higher cost pressures and cash\u2011flow challenges. Meanwhile, consumer financial fragility remains high, with many households spending most of their income on essentials and experiencing anxiety over finances. Overall, the economy shows resilience in employment and business confidence, but underlying risks from inflation, tariffs, and labor market frictions persist.",
