  "description": "Former South Carolina Lt. Gov. Andr\u00e9 Bauer has suspended his GOP primary challenge to Sen. Lindsey Graham",
  "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former South Carolina Lt. Gov. Andr\u00e9 Bauer is suspending his GOP primary challenge to Sen. Lindsey Graham, shuttering his effort to oust the four-term incumbent after just more than a month and eschewing a \u201cpolitical climate that rewards deception over honesty, or ambition over unity.\u201d\n\nIn posts on social media, Bauer wrote Friday that he had decided to shutter his campaign \u201cafter deep prayer and reflection,\u201d saying he believed \u201cwe must stop tearing one another down with lies and division.\u201d He stopped short of endorsing any of the remaining candidates in the race to challenge Graham, who already has backing from President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a statement, Graham said he wished Bauer well. Graham campaign spokesperson Abby Zilch called it \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that South Carolina stood behind reelecting the incumbent.\n\nBauer, a wealthy developer and longtime Trump backer, launched his effort 38 days ago, arguing that Graham isn\u2019t conservative enough to represent South Carolina. In a pre-launch interview with The Associated Press, Bauer described himself as \u201ca real, America First conservative\u201d intent on representing what he sees as South Carolina conservatives\u2019 true values, and he said \u201cGraham's been there too long, and he votes like it.\u201d\n\nGraham \u2014 whose relationship with Trump has undulated through the years \u2014 has faced previous primary challenges from the right, with opponents accusing him of kowtowing to Democrats on issues from immigration to climate change.\n\nBut Graham also hews to Republican priorities on national security. Ahead of the U.S. strike on Iranian facilities in June, Graham called for Trump to \u201cgo all-in\u201d in backing Israel and destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nFor this cycle, Graham kicked off his reelection campaign in February and quickly secured Trump\u2019s endorsement, and Chris LaCivita, a co-campaign manager of Trump\u2019s 2024 bid, is serving as a senior adviser.\n\nBauer has backed Trump since before his win in South Carolina\u2019s 2016 GOP primary. At his 2024 campaign\u2019s South Carolina launch event, Trump called Bauer, who served on his state leadership committee, \u201ca friend of mine, somebody that could, I think, run for almost any office and win.\u201d\n\nBauer served in the South Carolina legislature before, at age 33, he was elected the youngest lieutenant governor in the country in 2002. After two terms, he mounted an unsuccessful 2010 gubernatorial bid, finishing last in a four-way GOP primary ultimately won by Nikki Haley.",

      "text": "Sen. Tim Scott and South Carolina\u2019s governor will chair Lindsey Graham\u2019s reelection bid\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of President Donald Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, is kicking off his pursuit of a fifth term with two of his home state\u2019s top Republicans chairing his 2026 campaign, an early show of strength in a race where the longtime lawmaker is expected to face primary challengers.\nGraham\u2019s campaign told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Sen. Tim Scott and Gov. Henry McMaster will chair his 2026 run. Scott, the state\u2019s junior senator, is current chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the chamber\u2019s campaign arm and \u2014 after challenging Trump for the 2024 presidential nomination \u2014 campaigned for him during the GOP primary.\nMcMaster recently became the state\u2019s longest-serving governor, having been elected to two terms of his own after serving the remaining two years of Nikki Haley\u2019s term after she became Trump\u2019s first ambassador to the United Nations.\nBoth McMaster and Scott were surrogates for Trump in the 2024 presidential campaign, and their early support for Graham in his own bid is intended as a signal of strength for the incumbent in a state where Trump has maintained high popularity since his 2016 run.\nIt\u2019s also an early strike in the race, where Graham \u2014 as he typically does \u2014 is expected to face primary challengers. The Trump confidant has long been targeted by the far right in his state, critiqued by his own party and booed at a home-state rally.\nCounty-level Republican parties have censured Graham a number of times for his willingness to work on bipartisan deals. One such measure derided Graham\u2019s \u201ccondescending attitude\u201d to the party\u2019s grassroots organizers.\nHe has even drawn boos at some events of the party faithful in his home state. That includes a July 2023 Trump rally in Pickens \u2014 in the county where Graham grew up \u2014 where objections from the crowd drowned out more than five minutes of his remarks. When he took the stage, Trump also elicited boos when he mentioned Graham\u2019s name, saying he was \u201cgoing to have to work on these people\u201d and adding that Graham is \u201cthere when you need him.\u201d\nLast month, Graham\u2019s campaign said he had more than $15.6 million cash on hand for his reelection bid, including nearly a million raised in the last quarter of 2024 alone. In 2020, Graham bested several GOP challengers before going on to defeat Democratic nominee Jaime Harrison \u2014 who recently ended his term as Democratic National Committee chairman \u2014 by a margin of 10 percentage points.\nPotential Republican primary challengers for this cycle include South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, and Adam Morgan, a former South Carolina legislator who lost a primary bid last year against U.S. Rep. William Timmons.\n___\nKinnard reported from Houston and can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP"

      "text": "A split forms in MAGA world as Trump weighs next steps on Iran, with some top stars rebuking him\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nA schism has opened among President Donald Trump\u2019s most devout MAGA supporters and national security conservatives over the Israel-Iran conflict, as some longtime defenders of the president\u2019s America First mantra call him out for weighing a greater U.S. role in the region.\nGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, commentator Tucker Carlson and conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk \u2014 with legions of their own devoted followers \u2014 are reminding audiences of Trump\u2019s 2024 promises to resist overseas military involvement after a week of deadly strikes and counterstrikes between Israel and Iran, and discussion of U.S. involvement.\nOn social media and their popular airwaves, questions about Trump\u2019s stance from these central validating voices are exposing a crack in his forward guard. They are also warning that the schism could deter progress on other priorities.\n\u201cNo issue currently divides the right as much as foreign policy,\u201d Kirk wrote on X, adding he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d that a massive split among MAGA could \u201cdisrupt our momentum and our insanely successful Presidency.\u201d\nThe State Department and U.S. military last week directed a voluntary evacuation of nonessential personnel and their loved ones from some U.S. diplomatic outposts in the Middle East.\nTrump on Monday abruptly departed this week\u2019s G7 Summit in Canada due to the intensifying conflict, returning to Washington for urgent talks with his national security team. He also posted an ominous social media warning that \u201cEveryone should immediately evacuate Tehran!\u201d\nThe moves sparked new speculation from his isolationist devotees that the U.S. might be deepening its involvement, perhaps by providing the Israelis with bunker-busting bombs to penetrate Iranian nuclear sites or offering other direct U.S. military support.\nOther strong Trump backers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., are making the case that this is Trump\u2019s moment to deliver a decisive blow against Iran. Graham is calling for Trump to \u201cgo all-in\u201d in backing Israel and destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\u201cIf that means providing bombs, provide bombs,\u201d he said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIf that means flying with Israel, fly with Israel.\u201d\nShould the U.S. wade into a war in the Middle East, Trump would begin unraveling his own political base, built on ending foreign entanglements, curbing illegal immigration and reducing the trade deficit, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon said Monday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to not just blow up the coalition,\u201d Bannon said on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show. \u201cIt\u2019s also going to thwart what we\u2019re doing with the most important thing, which is the deportation\u201d of immigrants in the U.S. illegally.\nAny option comes with political risk for Trump, who, as he returned to Washington, expressed exasperation at Iranian leaders\u2019 failure to reach an agreement.\n\u201cThey should have done the deal. I told them, \u2018Do the deal,\u2019\u201d he told reporters on Air Force One. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not too much in the mood to negotiate.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Trump said on social media that the U.S. knows where Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is hiding during the conflict but doesn\u2019t want him killed \u201cfor now.\u201d He also called for Iran\u2019s \u201cUNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.\u201d\nA look at what some of Trump\u2019s top MAGA-world backers are saying:\nTucker Carlson\nOn Monday, Carlson\u2019s increasingly critical rhetoric toward Trump reached a new level, as the longtime supporter who headlined large rallies with Trump during the 2024 campaign suggested Trump\u2019s posture was breaking his pledge to keep the United States out of new foreign entanglements.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to convince me that the Iranian people are my enemy,\u201d Carlson said as a guest on \u201cWar Room,\u201d the podcast led by 2016 Trump campaign adviser Steve Bannon. \u201cIt\u2019s Orwell, man. I\u2019m a free man. You\u2019re not telling me who I have to hate.\u201d\nCarlson posted to X that same day his call to challenge other Trump media supporters like Sean Hannity and Mark Levin to push the president to uphold his campaign pledge.\nTrump has bristled at the criticism, posting on social media, \u201cSomebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that,\u2019 IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!\u2019\u201d\n___\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\nThe Georgia Republican \u2014 the epitome of MAGA, sporting the signature red cap for President Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 State of the Union address \u2014 has publicly sided with Carlson, directly calling out Trump for deriding \u201cone of my favorite people.\u201d\nSaying the former Fox News commentator \u201cunapologetically believes the same things I do,\u201d Greene wrote on X Monday night that those beliefs include that \u201cforeign wars/intervention/regime change put America last, kill innocent people, are making us broke, and will ultimately lead to our destruction.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not kooky,\u201d Greene added, using the same word Trump used to describe Carlson. \u201cThat\u2019s what millions of Americans voted for. It\u2019s what we believe is America First.\u201d\n___\nCharlie Kirk\nThe founder of Turning Point USA has been generally supportive of Trump, saying Monday in an interview with Fox News that \u201cthis is the moment that President Trump was elected for,\u201d but he\u2019s also warned of a potential MAGA divide over Iran since last week.\nDays later, Kirk said, \u201cTrump voters, especially young people, supported President Trump because he was the first president in my lifetime to not start a new war.\u201d He also wrote that \u201cthere is historically little support for America to be actively engaged in yet another offensive war in the Middle East. We must work for and pray for peace.\u201d\nThat same day, Kirk noted, \u201cThe last thing America needs right now is a new war. Our number one desire must be peace, as quickly as possible.\u201d\n___\nThere have been other divides\nThe evolving situation surrounding Iran isn\u2019t the first time Trump and some of his base have diverged, and it\u2019s possible the current tension is more of a disagreement than a breakup between the president and the MAGA faithful.\nIn April, some thought leaders and influential podcasters who backed Trump\u2019s campaign voiced doubts as global markets buckled under the pressure of impending tariffs.\nTrump has been critical of U.S. support for Ukraine, in December calling Biden\u2019s decision to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory \u201ca very stupid thing to do.\u201d But Trump stopped short of cutting off all funding, something for which other allies, including Carlson, have advocated.\n__\nKinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP"

Andr\u00e9 Bauer is mounting a GOP primary challenge to Sen. Lindsey Graham, arguing the incumbent isn\u2019t conservative enough to represent the state.\nBauer, a wealthy developer, is a longtime backer of President Donald Trump. His candidacy sets up a midterm grudge match with Graham, a four-term senator whose relationship with Trump has undulated through the years, but who has Trump\u2019s endorsement for reelection.\nBauer has described himself as \u201ca real, America First conservative\u201d intent on representing what he sees as South Carolina conservatives\u2019 true values.\n\u201cI think Graham\u2019s been there too long, and he votes like it,\u201d Bauer told The Associated Press Tuesday night. \u201cI\u2019m guaranteed, I\u2019m conservative, and I don\u2019t think he is.\u201d\nRepublicans dominate South Carolina\u2019s statewide-elected positions, meaning that the most intense political competition takes place in GOP primaries.\nGraham has faced previous primary challenges from the right, with opponents accusing him of kowtowing to Democrats on issues from immigration to climate change.

This week, Graham\u2019s campaign announced that Chris LaCivita, a co-campaign manager of Trump\u2019s 2024 bid, would serve as a senior adviser. On Tuesday, Abby Zilch, spokeswoman for Graham\u2019s campaign, noted that the senator had earned Trump\u2019s \u201ccomplete and total endorsement,\u201d adding that Bauer \u201chas spent his career chasing titles to feed his ego.\u201d\nBauer said he understood Trump\u2019s need to use Capitol Hill relationships to advance his legislative priorities, like the tax cuts and spending bill that came before the Senate Budget Committee \u2014 which Graham chairs \u2014 before passing the chamber earlier Tuesday.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s got to work and get his bills passed,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cLindsey\u2019s chairman of a major committee. ...

      "text": "Donald Trump and Lindsey Graham are again at odds, now over abortion. The strife could help both men\nDonald Trump and Lindsey Graham are again at odds, now over abortion. The strife could help both men\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 The long and occasionally quixotic relationship between Donald Trump and Lindsey Graham has again turned negative after the South Carolina senator criticized the former president for refusing to support a federal abortion ban.\nTrump repeatedly disparaged Graham on his social media site and said he regretted endorsing the senator during his last reelection campaign. Graham, a staunch abortion opponent who has pushed for a national ban, did not back down from his criticism, saying Trump\u2019s view was an \u201cerror.\u201d\nBut some observers of the Trump-Graham dynamic think both Republicans benefit from their public strife.\nFor Trump, they say, creating public distance from anti-abortion advocates might help him blunt President Joe Biden\u2019s attacks on an issue that Democrats have long credited for electoral victories since the U.S. Supreme Court, with three justices Trump nominated, overturned Roe v. Wade. Graham, meanwhile, gets to burnish his conservative bona fides against years of home-state criticism that he is too liberal.\nState Rep. John McCravy, a Republican who sponsored South Carolina\u2019s new law that bans most abortions at six weeks, said he could not see how the back-and-forth really harmed either Trump or Graham with voters.\nTrump \u201cwants to get elected, and I think that appearing to be moderate helps him to get elected,\u201d McCravy said. \u201cRegardless of what they say, I think he\u2019s taking the practical side of this. He\u2019s pointing out something that\u2019s true and using that to show that he\u2019s not an extremist.\u201d\nSpokespeople for Trump\u2019s campaign and Graham\u2019s Senate office did not immediately comment when asked Friday about the squabble.\nA smashed cellphone; a vow to \u2018count me out\u2019\nThe two have been at odds before.\nThey started off that way in the 2016 campaign when both sought the presidential nomination. Shortly after Trump launched his bid, Graham questioned Trump\u2019s mental fitness for office, calling him a \u201cjackass\u201d who \u201cshouldn\u2019t be commander in chief\u201d for making disparaging remarks about then-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., one of Graham\u2019s closest allies.\nCampaigning in Graham\u2019s home state a day later, Trump opened a rally by calling Graham a \u201clightweight\u201d and \u201cidiot\u201d before reading out the senator\u2019s private cellphone number to the crowd\u2019s delight and disbelief. That move led Graham to poke fun at destroying the device after being deluged with angry messages.\nGraham ultimately abandoned his own presidential effort and did not attend the 2016 convention, saying he would back neither Trump nor Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and that the Republican Party had been \u201cconned.\u201d\nBut after Trump\u2019s election, Graham was all in. He became one of the president\u2019s top Senate confidants and a frequent golf partner. Saying there was \u201can obligation\u201d to help a president, especially a fellow Republican, Graham told The Associated Press in a 2018 interview that he had warmed to Trump and suggested he had used that relationship to shape decisions. Graham did not cite specifics.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to be helpful where I could because I think he needs all the help he can get,\u201d Graham said. \u201cYou can be a better critic when people understand that you\u2019re trying to help them be successful.\u201d\nGraham helped shepherd the three Supreme Court nominees who were in the conservative majority that overturned Roe in 2022. That included Brett Kavanaugh, whom Graham defended against allegations of sexual assault. Graham called the Senate Judiciary Committee proceedings in which they unfolded \u201cthe most unethical sham since I\u2019ve been in politics.\u201d\nThat pivot toward Trump paid off when Graham ran for reelection in 2020. The senator\u2019s popularity among Republicans in his home state grew as he developed a relationship with Trump.\nIn the days after that election, when Trump lost to Biden, Graham would be drawn into Trump\u2019s legal woes. Graham was ordered to testify before a special grand jury investigating whether Trump and others illegally tried to influence the vote in Georgia. Trump and others eventually faced charges of trying to interfere in the outcome.\nNot long after, Graham would take to the Senate floor to deliver an emotional farewell to Trump\u2019s term, saying he felt the then-president must accept his own role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and that the whole matter had been a disappointing \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d in the administration\u2019s closing days.\n\u201cTrump and I, we\u2019ve had a hell of a journey. I hate it to end this way. Oh my God, I hate it,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom my point of view, he\u2019s been a consequential president, but today, first thing you\u2019ll see. All I can say is count me out, enough is enough.\u201d\nA union of mutual convenience\nJust weeks later, Graham visited Trump at his Florida home. And Graham stood by Trump as the former president launched latest White House campaign and faced a succession of criminal indictments.\nDating back more than a decade, Graham has been criticized by South Carolina conservatives who have accused him of kowtowing to Democrats on issues from immigration and bank bailouts to gun restrictions and climate change. But he also hews to Republican priorities on national security and a strong defense of allies against Russia and China, defending Trump when he is criticized for suggesting he would encourage Russia to attack NATO allies he considers delinquent.\nTrump\u2019s backing helped blunt some conservative backlash in 2020, when Graham vanquished both primary challenges from the right and the best-funded Democratic opponent in history \u2014 Jaime Harrison, now the Democratic National Committee chairman \u2014 sailing to victory by double digits, even as Trump lost.\nGraham joined Trump\u2019s leadership team in South Carolina for the 2024 campaign, and Trump easily won the first-in-the-South primary.\nBut the anti-Graham voices among Trump\u2019s supporters have grown louder.\nCampaigning for Trump across the early-voting states, Graham drew boos at rallies in New Hampshire and South Carolina, where Trump supporters jeered Graham for more than five minutes during his remarks in July. After Trump\u2019s South Carolina victory in February, Trump introduced his ally as someone who \u201chappens to be a little bit further left\u201d than his other backers, adding, \u201cI always say, when I\u2019m in trouble on the left, I call up Lindsey Graham.\u201d\nWith his seat up in 2026, Graham may be thinking of the discontented conservative voices he will likely face while campaigning, conservative strategist Dave Wilson said.\n\u201cYou know when you have two people who have never danced before, but they both know how to do the salsa, and the music starts playing, and they just know how to do the dance?\u201d Wilson asked. \u201cIt\u2019s like that. Trump and Graham know how to do the dance of Washington, and they\u2019re doing it effectively. They know what they\u2019re doing, and they\u2019re doing it on purpose.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer Farnoush Amiri in Washington contributed to this report.\n___\nKinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP"

Bauer, who argued that Graham is not conservative enough, did not endorse any remaining candidates after ending his campaign. Graham, who has secured Trump's endorsement for his reelection bid, is expected to face other challengers as he seeks a fifth term, with significant support from key South Carolina Republicans.",
