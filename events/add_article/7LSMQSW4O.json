      "summary": "A New York Times guest essay by former National Security Council members criticized the military's lack of resistance to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard, leading to accusations on social media that the Times was advocating for a military coup. The authors expressed concern that military leaders no longer view themselves as guardians of the constitutional order, prompting backlash from commentators who interpreted the piece as dangerous rhetoric. The Times defended the essay as a fact-checked opinion from experienced writers, while critics, including White House officials, condemned it as a call for insurrection against the elected president.",
