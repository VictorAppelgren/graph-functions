  "title": "Tesla sales in Europe slump 40% as BYD new car registrations more than triple",
  "description": "Electric car business run by Elon Musk continues to lose ground to Chinese rival despite recent revamp of Model Y",
  "content": "Tesla sales slumped 40% across Europe in July compared with a year earlier, as the electric car company run by Elon Musk faces increasingly tough competition from its Chinese rival BYD.\n\nThere were 8,837 sales of Tesla cars last month across the EU, the European Free Trade Association and the UK, according to figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA). That compared with 14,769 at the same point last year.\n\nMeanwhile, new car registrations for BYD more than tripled across Europe last month to 13,503, compared with 4,151 last year. BYD\u2019s now has 1.2% market share, the ACEA found. Tesla\u2019s share stood at 0.8%.\n\nChinese car brands, which often have relatively cheaper models, have been expanding aggressively in Europe. BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time this spring, according to a report from the market research company JATO Dynamics.\n\nIn the UK the government said on Thursday that the US car brand Ford would be the first manufacturer to receive the maximum \u00a33,750 subsidy on two models: the Gen-E and the e-Tourneo Courier. A further 26 other models will be eligible for grants of \u00a31,500 under the government\u2019s new electric car grant scheme.\n\nThe grants only apply to vehicles with a list price of \u00a337,000 or below, and the discount is applied automatically at the point of sale.\n\nThe transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: \u201cWe\u2019re putting money back in people\u2019s pockets and making it easier and cheaper for families to make the switch to electric, by delivering discounts of up to \u00a33,750 on EVs.\n\n\u201cOur measures are driving competition in the UK EV market, boosting economic growth and supporting jobs and skills as part of our plan for change.\u201d\n\nSeparately the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said UK car production rose for a second month in a row in July, by 5.6%.\n\nHowever, the SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said it was a turbulent time in the market, with \u201cconsumer confidence weak, trade flows volatile and massive investment in new technologies under way both here and abroad\u201d.\n\nACEA also reported that in the first seven months of 2025, 1,011,903 new battery-electric cars were registered, accounting for 15.6% of the EU market share.\n\nHybrid-electric car registrations proved more popular, with 2,255,080 units sold across the EU so far this year. This was driven by growth in the four biggest markets: France, up 30.5%, Spain, up 30.2%, Germany, up 10.7, and Italy, up 9.4%.\n\nSigrid de Vries, the director general of ACEA, said that to accelerate uptake, Europe \u201cmust continue to expand public recharging infrastructure, secure lower recharging prices, and ensure well-coordinated purchase incentives schemes\u201d.",

We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nIf European Union or United Kingdom data protection law applies to the processing of your information, you can review the European requirements section below to learn more about your rights and Google\u2019s compliance with these laws.\nContents\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\n- Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\n- Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\n- Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\nInformation Google collects\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users \u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\nWhen you\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\u2019re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\nWhen you\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\nThings you create or provide to us\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \u2014 like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\nInformation we collect as you use our services\nYour apps, browsers & devices\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\u2019re using your Android device.\nYour activity\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\n- Terms you search for\n- Videos you watch\n- Views and interactions with content and ads\n- Voice and audio information\n- Purchase activity\n- People with whom you communicate or share content\n- Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\n- Chrome browsing history you\u2019ve synced with your Google Account\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\u2019s saved in your account.\nYour location information\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\nDepending on the products you\u2019re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\n- GPS and other sensor data from your device\n- IP address\n- Activity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\n- Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\u2019s location on or off using the device\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\nWhy Google collects data\nWe use data to build better services\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\nProvide our services\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\nMaintain & improve our services\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\nDevelop new services\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\u2019ve already installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \u201cmountain bikes,\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\n- We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\n- We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\n- We don\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \u201ctap to call\u201d button, we\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\nMeasure performance\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\nCommunicate with you\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\nWe\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.\nYour privacy controls\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\nWhen you\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you\u2019ve saved with Google.\nWe also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your Google Account includes:\nPrivacy controls\nActivity Controls\nDecide what types of activity you\u2019d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\nAd settings\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. You can modify your interests, choose whether your personal information is used to make ads more relevant to you, and turn on or off certain advertising services.\nAbout you\nManage personal info in your Google Account and control who can see it across Google services.\nShared endorsements\nChoose whether your name and photo appear next to your activity, like reviews and recommendations, that appear in ads.\nSites and apps that use Google services\nManage information that websites and apps using Google services, like Google Analytics, may share with Google when you visit or interact with their services.\nGo to How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services\nWays to review & update your information\nMy Activity\nMy Activity allows you to review and control data that\u2019s saved to your Google Account when you\u2019re signed in and using Google services, like searches you\u2019ve done or your visits to Google Play. You can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.\nGoogle Dashboard\nGoogle Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.\nYour personal information\nManage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.\nWhen you\u2019re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:\n- Signed-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.\n- YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.\n- Ad Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\nExporting, removing & deleting your information\nYou can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.\nTo delete your information, you can:\n- Delete your content from specific Google services\n- Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity\n- Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products\n- Delete your entire Google Account\nInactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you\u2019re unexpectedly unable to use your account.\nAnd finally, you can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law and our policies.\nThere are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you\u2019re signed in to a Google Account, including:\n- Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\n- Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\nSharing your information\nWhen you share your information\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\nWhen you\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.\nWhen Google shares your information\nWe do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:\nWith your consent\nWe\u2019ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we\u2019ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant.

For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based on your activity.\n- If you connect your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. Learn more\n- If you\u2019re a user in the EU, the decisions you make on linking services will affect how certain Google services can use the data across our services.\nViews and interactions with content and ads\nFor example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.\nVoice and audio information\nFor example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like \u201cHey Google,\u201d Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. Learn more\nyour activity on other sites and apps\nThis activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.\nLearn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps."

      "text": "Introduction\nThis is the privacy policy for Guardian News & Media Limited (collectively referred to as \u201cGuardian\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d in this policy), our sites such as theguardian.com and our associated apps (\u201cour sites\u201d). Some of our other sites and services have their own policies, which will be relevant to you when you are using those sites and services.\nOur values guide everything that we do \u2013 including our editorial approach and how we use personal data. We are strongly committed to keeping your personal data safe. This commitment exists throughout the lifecycle of your personal data, from the design of any Guardian service which uses personal data to the deletion of that data.\nTo complement our global approach to privacy protection, this policy also incorporates specific data privacy rights granted to individuals under Californian and Australian privacy law. This reflects our relationship with our readers in these locations where we provide localised editions of our editorial content.\nWe think carefully about our use of personal data, and below you can find the details of what we do to protect your privacy. This policy covers, among other topics:\n-\nInformation about your rights, the choices available to you, and our obligations in the UK, European Union, in California, in Australia, and elsewhere.\n-\nTransparency about how we collect and use your personal data, including when and how it is shared.\n-\nInformation on how we protect your personal data.\n-\nInformation on how we will facilitate your rights and respond to your questions.\nFind out more about how we manage your personal data below.\nAbout this privacy policy\nThis privacy policy explains how we collect, use, share, transfer and sell (for California residents only) your personal data when you use the services provided on our sites or interact with us.

You can read that information using these links:\n-\nGuardian Jobs (jobseekers)\n-\nGuardian Jobs (recruiters)\nSometimes our sites may contain links to sites and services that are not part of the Guardian family of offerings. These sites and services have their own privacy policies.

However, we will still have the personal data that we received when you first set up your Guardian account using your Google login, Apple ID, or any other social media sign in.\nApple\nIf you register or sign in with your Apple ID, you give Apple permission to share your personal data with us. This only includes your first and last name, and your email address. You can also choose to hide your email and Apple will create a random email address so your personal email can stay private.

This email address will be linked to your Guardian profile and will be used to retrieve your subscribed content.\nPersonal data when you post comments about the Guardian on other social media sites\nIf you have mentioned the Guardian in posts on social media sites, then we may collect your social media handles.\nWhen you post publicly (comments) on our sites\nWhen you post on a discussion board or comment publicly on an article on one of our sites, the personal data you post, including your username and other information about yourself, are publicly accessible. This personal data can be viewed online and collected by other people. We are not responsible for the way these other people use this personal data. When contributing to a discussion, we strongly recommend you avoid sharing any personal details, including information that can be used to identify you directly such as your name, age, address and name of employer.

We will rely on consent to:\n-\nPlace non-essential cookies and similar technologies including for personalised advertising as set out in the \u201cPrivacy settings\u201d link on our sites in the footer of every page, which you may withdraw at any time depending on whether you are able to read the Guardian ad free or have a Guardian Ad-Lite subscription.\n-\nSending editorial newsletters that you have signed up to receive.\n-\n-\nPerformance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you): We will use your personal data if we need to in order to perform a contract with you.

We may contact you directly via social media or email if you enter competitions, prize draws, bids or respond to call-outs.\n-\nCompliance with law: In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal data, for example to retain records of transactions as required by financial regulations.\n-\nOur legitimate interest: We may process your personal data where it is necessary for our legitimate interests in a way that might be expected as part of running the Guardian and in a way which does not materially impact your rights and freedoms. For example, it is in our legitimate interest for us to understand our readers, promote our services and ways to support us, and operate our sites efficiently for the creation, publication and distribution of news, media and related journalistic content both online and in print form, globally.

Data protection law includes certain exemptions when personal data is processed for the purposes of journalism. Those exemptions apply to some of the ways the Guardian uses personal data. This privacy policy does not cover personal data that the Guardian processes for the purposes of journalism.\nThe Guardian may use generative AI functionalities in our software and systems, including in our use of personal data. The Guardian has set out our generative AI principles on how we will use generative AI.\nAccess permissions when you are using the Guardian app\nWhen you use the Guardian app, we will ask for permissions to access particular functions of your mobile device.

This includes, for example, the region that you are located in, so that we can show you the prices for subscriptions or other products in your local currency. We may also add personal data to improve the accuracy of your delivery address when we send out mail. We may also obtain your personal data from partners whose offers we include in some of our marketing communications and we use this personal data to ensure that we do not send you irrelevant marketing and to ensure the accuracy of the information we hold.\nWe also use personal data based on the content you have viewed on our sites and your interaction with the content to add you to groups with similar interests and preferences, so that we can make our online advertising more relevant. Sometimes we use data about your interests or demographics that some of our global third parties have collected from you online to add you to these groups, such as Comscore and Nielsen. Please refer to our cookie policy for more information on how we use cookies.\nPersonal data shared by event partners\nWhen you register or book a ticket for a Guardian event organised by an event partner, your registration data may be shared with us by the event partner.\nPersonal data shared by survey partners\nWhen you participate in a survey conducted by one of our survey partners, your email address may be shared with us by the survey partner to facilitate follow-up research.\nChildren\u2019s personal data\nWe do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal data about children under 13 in providing our services. Some of our services may have a higher age restriction and this will be shown at the point of registration.\nWe also note and comply with the California law which prohibits sale of personal data of consumers between 13-16 years of age unless their guardian has authorised the sale.\nSecurity of your personal data\nWe have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. You are responsible for choosing a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of our sites. You should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site. You should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us. Sending any information, including personal data, via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.\nWhen we share your personal data\nWithin the Guardian group of companies\nDepending on where you live, we may share your personal data within the Guardian group of companies in the UK, US, or Australia. We may share it in order to perform a contract with you, for administrative purposes, or when we have a legitimate interest in doing so. For example:\n-\nIf you book an event held in Australia, at first we may hold your data on our systems in the UK and then we may share it with the Guardian in Australia for administration purposes.\n-\nSometimes we may receive a letter, email or another form of communication from you that we consider to be significant to the history of the Guardian. We may decide to share this with the Guardian Archive run by the Guardian Foundation for historic and archiving purposes.\n-\nWe may share your data to understand how you interact across our group products or to tailor and offer relevant advertising to you.\nWith external organisations\nWe share your personal data with other organisations that are not directly linked to us under the following circumstances:\nService providers - We may share your data with other organisations that provide services on our behalf. We may do this to perform a contract we have entered into with you, where it is in our legitimate interests or with your consent. Examples of when we may share your data with service providers include sharing with:\n-\nCompanies that help deliver newspapers and subscription vouchers, such as i-Movo.\n-\nOnline payments processors who process credit and debit card or other forms of payments on our behalf.\n-\nFraud management providers that help us to identify and prevent online fraud.\n-\nInternet and cloud hosting services providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n-\nLife-cycle engagement platforms such as Braze, to help us build and manage our campaigns and send our email communications, including newsletters.\n-\nSoftware service providers such as Salesforce and mParticle that assist us with our customer relationship management.\n-\nCommunications services providers, such as our podcast service provider called Acast.\n-\nError tracking software providers, such as Sentry and Google Firebase, to help us diagnose and fix errors and optimise the performance of our website and apps.\n-\nService providers that help us carry out analytics, facilitate audience creation and segmentation and to measure our audience engagement. For example, Permutive provides us with data management platform services.\n-\nService providers that help provide us with insights and analytics that help us to improve our products and services.\n-\nGoogle ReCaptcha, which we use to protect our sites from fraudulent users.\n-\nData management companies, such as Formstack, that help us collect data via online forms and surveys.\n-\nService providers that help provide online identity-as-a-service and access management services such as Okta.\n-\nService providers that allow us to deliver personalised advertising to your device, such as Criteo.\n-\nService providers that allow us to compare your personal data with information held by advertising partners and identify if you are known to both us and our advertising partner, such as Permutive.\n-\nYouTube because we use their unbranded embedded player to provide video content on our websites and apps. The embedded player relies on the YouTube API, which is a type of software that allows data to be communicated between our website and apps and the YouTube player. This will include personal data which will also be collected by cookies as set out in our cookie policy. We will provide this data about how you interact with videos to enable YouTube to provide statistical information such as how many views a video has, or how many users watch the entire video. More information about how YouTube will use this personal data, which includes usage data when you interact or use the embedded YouTube player, can be found at the Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy.\n-\nSkimlinks because they are an affiliate marketing service provider. We do not drop first or third party cookies, or otherwise access local storage through our affiliate links. Instead we use a type of link that redirects users into Skimlinks\u2019 network. This means we are tracking and identifying the click, rather than individuals. Skimlinks will use IP addresses to direct readers to the geographically relevant affiliate link. The IP address and user agent are anonymised and truncated by Skimlinks. Third party sites including retailers and sites in Skimlinks\u2019 network may place cookies or collect additional information. Details about Skimlinks use of data is set out in their privacy policy at https://skimlinks.com/privacy-policy.\nAdvertising partners - We may also share your data collected through our sites with our advertising partners, as set out in our cookie policy. These partners help us deliver relevant advertising across our sites. For example, we use Google Ad Manager to assist us with the delivery of relevant ads.\nThese partners may also generate their own identifier from your device or email address for the purpose of personalised advertising. You can find details about these partners\u2019 use of data and opt out of their identifiers through the following links:\n-\nLiveRamp: https://liveramp.uk/privacy/service-privacy-policy/ and opt out - https://liveramp.uk/privacy/your-rights/\n-\nID5: Privacy policy - https://id5.io/platform-privacy-policy/ and opt out - https://id5-sync.com/privacy\n-\nLotame: Privacy policy - https://www.lotame.com/privacy/privacy-notices/services/ and opt out - https://www.lotame.com/privacy/privacy-manager/\n-\nThe Trade Desk: Privacy policy - https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/privacy and opt out - https://adsrvr.org/\n-\nEUID: Privacy policy - https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/privacy and opt out - https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/\n-\nUID2: Privacy policy - https://transparentadvertising.com/privacy and opt out - https://www.transparentadvertising.com/\nAffiliate marketing - When a product is linked from a Guardian article or gallery, if the retailer has an affiliate programme, then the link will redirect to the retailer website through our affiliate marketing partner, such as Skimlinks\u2019 network. When a reader clicks on a link, Skimlinks will identify which page the click came from and assign it a randomly generated number. This is communicated to the retailer and associated with any subsequent purchase. The affiliate marketing partner, such as Skimlinks, then reconciles the list of clicks from links on the Guardian with purchases on the retailer\u2019s site. This is used in order to calculate the commission for the Guardian.\nAgencies and authorities if required by law - We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority, or in connection with any legal action if we are required to do so to meet a legal or regulatory obligation, where the request is proportionate, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else (for example, in response to a valid and properly served legal process such as subpoena or warrant). If we have your contact details, we will take reasonable steps to attempt to notify you prior to disclosing your data unless (i) prohibited by applicable law from doing so, or (ii) there are clear indications of unlawful conduct in connection with your use of Guardian services.\nEvent sponsors and partners - We may share your personal data with sponsors of Guardian events and partners who we hold events with for marketing purposes when you have given your permission for us to do so. We may also share your personal data with these sponsors and partners for event administration and security purposes.\nPrize draws, competitions and bids - We may share your personal data with sponsors and partners for the purposes of selecting and notifying winners when you participate in any of our prize draws, competitions and bids. We may also share your data with entities offering any prize you have won in order for that entity to contact you about such a prize.\nSocial media organisations - We may share your personal data with other organisations when our web pages use social plug-ins from these organisations (such as liking or sharing on social media).

We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards.\nCalifornia resident - Do not sell\nThese transfers to third parties may constitute \u201csale\u201d of your personal information under California law. A California resident can halt these sales at any time by pressing the \u201cCalifornia resident - Do not sell\u201d link that is located in the footer of every page on our site.

For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep your personal data while you are still using our product or service. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a subscription.\nIf we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data.

      "text": "Google Terms of Service\nEffective May 22, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDF\nCountry version: Sweden\nWhat\u2019s covered in these terms\nWe know it\u2019s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it\u2019s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google services, and what we expect from you.\nThese Terms of Service reflect the way Google\u2019s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we\u2019ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google\u2019s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:\n- What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services\n- What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services\n- Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services \u2014 whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others\n- In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms\nUnderstanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms. We encourage you to download these terms for future reference. We make these terms, and all previous versions, available at all times here.\nBesides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it\u2019s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\nTerms\nService provider\nIn the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google services are provided by, and you\u2019re contracting with:\nGoogle Ireland Limited\nincorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland\n(Registration Number: 368047 / VAT Number: IE6388047V)\nGordon House, Barrow Street\nDublin 4\nIreland\nAge requirements\nIf you\u2019re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian\u2019s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.\nIf you\u2019re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you\u2019re responsible for your child\u2019s activity on the services.\nSome Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.\nYour relationship with Google\nThese terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of \u201cGoogle,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour,\u201d we mean Google Ireland Limited and its affiliates. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google\u2019s business works and how we earn money.\nWhat you can expect from us\nProvide a broad range of useful services\n- apps and sites (like Search and Maps)\n- platforms (like Google Shopping)\n- integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies\u2019 apps or sites)\n- devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)\nMany of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.\nOur services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.\nDevelop, improve, and update Google services\nWhile we use a broad definition of \u201cservices\u201d throughout these terms as described above, applicable law draws distinctions between \u201cdigital content\u201d, \u201cservices\u201d, and \u201cgoods\u201d in certain situations. That\u2019s why we use the more specific terms in this section and the Legal guarantee section.\nWe\u2019re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware.\nAs part of the continual evolution of our digital content, services, and goods, we make modifications such as adding or removing features and functionalities, increasing or decreasing usage limits, and offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also change our digital content or services for these other reasons:\n- to adapt to new technologies\n- to reflect increases or decreases in the number of people who use a particular service\n- to respond to key changes in the licenses and partnerships we have with others\n- to prevent abuse or harm\n- to address legal, regulatory, safety, or security issues\nIn particular, we sometimes make legally-required updates, which are modifications that keep digital content, services, or goods in conformity with the law. We make these updates to our digital content, services, and goods for safety or security reasons, and to make sure they meet the quality standards that you expect, such as those described in the Legal guarantee section. We may automatically install updates that address significant safety or security risks. For other updates, you can choose whether you want them installed.\nWe maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons.\nIf a modification negatively affects your ability to access or use our digital content or services, or if we stop offering a service all together, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice by email \u2014 including a description of the changes, when they\u2019ll take place, and your right to end your contract with us if our modifications create more than a minor negative impact \u2014 except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse or harm, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We\u2019ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, subject to applicable law and policies.\nWhat we expect from you\nFollow these terms and service-specific additional terms\n- these terms\n- service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements\nWe also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, Transparency Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site. Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services \u2013 such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.\nAlthough we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.\nRespect others\n- comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws\n- respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights\n- don\u2019t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) \u2014 for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others\nOur service-specific additional terms and policies, such as our Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy, provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren\u2019t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.\nDon\u2019t abuse our services\nMost people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don\u2019t respect those rules, so we\u2019re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:\nYou must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems \u2014 for example, by:- introducing malware\n- spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures\n- jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our safety and bug testing programs\n- accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:\n- phishing\n- creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews\n- misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human\n- providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us\n- providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not\n- using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone\u2019s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights\n- reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law\n- using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)\n- using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology\n- hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms\n- providing services that encourage others to violate these terms\nPermission to use your content\nSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content.

If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.\nLicense\nYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else\u2019s creative content if they\u2019ve given you their permission.\nWe need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content.

This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:\n- for spam, malware, and illegal content\n- to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together\n- to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in Ads Settings)\n- using content you\u2019ve shared publicly to promote the services.

The European Commission also offers an Online Dispute Resolution platform, but Google isn\u2019t legally required to use this or other alternative dispute resolution platforms.\nAbout these terms\nBy law, you have certain rights that can\u2019t be limited by a contract like these terms of service.

      "text": "China\u2019s share of the European electric car market has more than doubled in less than two years as the world\u2019s second largest economy tries to take the lead in the transition away from petrol and diesel cars.\nThe UK is the largest market in Europe for Chinese electric car brands, accounting for almost a third of sales in 2023 so far, according to data from Schmidt Automotive Research on the 18 largest European car markets. About 5% of all new car sales in the UK were from Chinese brands in the first seven months of 2023, a market share second only to Sweden.\nSales are accelerating: Chinese carmakers sold almost the same number of electric cars in Europe in the first seven months of 2023 as they did in the entirety of 2022.\nChinese brands have long struggled to break into Europe because of a reputation for lower-quality cars. However, some analysts believe the advent of new battery electric technology has wiped the slate clean for Chinese brands, and sales are booming.\nThe battery and carmaker BYD, which is backed by the US investor Warren Buffett, is the biggest maker of electric cars worldwide barring the US manufacturer Tesla. The state-owned SAIC and the private car conglomerate Geely are also vying with a host of electric-only startups such as Nio and Xpeng for a slice of the growing global market.\nThe share of Chinese cars in the total European car market has risen from 0.1% in 2019 to 2.8% in the first seven months of 2023, Schmidt said. But it is clear that Chinese companies are targeting electric vehicles in particular: the share of the market for pure battery electric cars rose from 0.5% in 2019 to 3.9% in 2021. So far this year, Chinese manufacturers have won 8.2% of the European electric car market, selling 86,000 battery electric cars.\nThe rapid rise of Chinese carmakers has set off alarm bells in Europe, where millions of people work in car manufacturing. China also has a significant advantage because it has the lead in production of batteries, leaving European industry reliant on a geopolitical rival until it builds its own \u201cgigafactories\u201d.\nThe BMW chief executive, Oliver Zipse, on Sunday said Chinese carmakers posed an \u201cimminent risk\u201d to the European industry, particularly for the makers of cheaper models.\n\u201cThe base car market segment will either vanish or will not be done by European manufacturers,\u201d he told the Financial Times, as carmakers gathered in Munich, Germany, for an automotive conference that is also being attended by several Chinese brands.\nXpeng used the Munich conference to announce that it was planning to sell its cars in Germany. Brian Gu, Xpeng\u2019s vice-chairman said it was an \u201cimportant step on our international expansion journey\u201d.\nOne notable Chinese brand in the UK is MG. The MG marque was founded in the 1920s but the brand was taken over by SAIC after MG Rover collapsed in 2005, after decades of decline for the UK industry\u2019s prominence. The Longbridge factory that made MG cars for decades has been replaced by housing and a Marks & Spencer.\nSAIC has launched a series of Chinese-made MG electric cars, which have proved very popular in the UK in part because of relatively low prices. The MG4 EV was the second bestselling electric car in the UK in the first seven months of 2023, behind Tesla\u2019s Model Y SUV, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.\nMatthias Schmidt, the founder of Schmidt Automotive Research, said: \u201cThe success in the UK of MG, which belongs to the China-state-owned SAIC, can partly be attributed to the fact that the brand, celebrating its centennial year this year, sees the UK as its ancestral home with a major design studio in London.\n\u201cMany UK customers may be unaware that MG is anything else but UK-owned, while MG\u2019s new roadster, the Cyberster, will do even more to add to its British racing heritage image among many.\u201d\nThe third top electric seller in the UK, the Polestar 2, is also made in China."

  "argos_summary": "Tesla\u2019s European sales fell 40% in July, dropping to 8,837 units versus 14,769 a year earlier, while BYD\u2019s registrations more than tripled to 13,503, giving it a 1.2% market share against Tesla\u2019s 0.8%. The UK government\u2019s new electric\u2011car grant scheme, offering up to \u00a33,750 subsidies for models priced under \u00a337,000, aims to boost EV adoption and stimulate competition. Meanwhile, UK production rose 5.6% in July, though industry leaders warn that weak consumer confidence and volatile trade flows could temper growth. Overall, Chinese EV makers are rapidly gaining market share in Europe, challenging established brands and prompting policy responses to support domestic manufacturing and infrastructure.",
