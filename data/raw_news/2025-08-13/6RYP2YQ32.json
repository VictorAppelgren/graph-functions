  "content": "At Comcast\u2019s Center City headquarters, many people do not report to the office four days every week, several current employees said, despite the company\u2019s stated four-days-in-office expectation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been informally told, like, make sure you\u2019re in at least three days a week,\u201d said one, a lawyer and parent of young children who said they personally average two or three days a week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m much more productive at home,\u201d the Comcast lawyer said, noting that picking up their kids from daycare is tricky on in-office days. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare that I\u2019m going in four days a week.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since Comcast, which employs roughly 8,000 at its headquarters, boosted its in-office expectations for hybrid workers.\n\nAt Independence Blue Cross, which employs about 3,000 at its Philadelphia headquarters, the rule has been three days a week in-office since spring 2024.\n\nCity workers were ordered back to the office full-time a year ago as Mayor Cherelle L. Parker eschewed the hybrid arrangements her predecessor had allowed.\n\nPresident Donald Trump this year made a similar push, ending telework for federal employees, of whom there are tens of thousands in the Philadelphia area.\n\nAs workplaces in the region made their push toward a more formalized in-office requirement, some employees were concerned about how the loss in flexibility would affect their ability to meet their families\u2019 needs and get work done. And some, who continued working remotely a majority of the time, worried that large employers pushing in-office time would inspire the same across Philadelphia.\n\nStill, data continue to show that pre-COVID-19 ways of working have not resumed.\n\nSince 2022, the number of Philly commuters has been rising each year, but it was still only 74% of 2019 levels at the end of last year, according to Philadelphia\u2019s Center City District, an advocacy group for the city\u2019s downtown.\n\nThe Inquirer checked in with employees at several large companies in Philadelphia to see how their hybrid work arrangements are working out, after their employers put specific mandates in place. Some employees are not named in this article because they feared compromising their employment or they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nEmployers have taken different approaches to encouraging in-office time, but all contacted by The Inquirer have pledged a commitment to work-life balance and flexibility. Individuals\u2019 routines are often determined by what their direct manager will allow, workers said, but thanks to security systems with badges or fobs for each worker, it\u2019s easy for employers to see who\u2019s coming in and who\u2019s not.\n\nEmployees\u2019 experiences vary, but \u2014 especially as the region awaits news on the possible reduction in public transit options \u2014 one common thread runs through them: the future of work in Philadelphia remains in flux.\n\nWhat does hybrid mean for Philly professionals?\n\nFor large employers, getting people back to the office required setting some rules. But in practice, it is tricky to create uniform requirements for hundreds, sometimes thousands, of employees with various functions and personal situations.\n\nAt Comcast, the company emphasized flexibility when it announced the four-days-a-week push. Since then, the policy hasn\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cOur in-office with flexibility approach has enabled all our teams \u2014 from technology, to product development, to the customer experience \u2014 to collaborate more effectively, resolve issues faster, and boost engagement,\" Comcast spokesperson John Demming said.\n\nSeveral Comcast employees said they\u2019ve seen and experienced plenty of flexibility. It\u2019s typical for colleagues to work only a partial day at the office and log in remotely for the rest of their hours. They said it\u2019s not uncommon for people to commute in just to \u201cget their swipes,\u201d but not stay long.\n\n\u201cIn general, the team morale is pretty high,\u201d said a Comcast employee in software engineering. \u201cWe go for lunch together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s helped anyone; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hurt anyone,\u201d said an employee who works in contracts. \u201cIt\u2019s not ruining anyone\u2019s life \u2026 that\u2019s also tied to the fact that my team is very flexible.\"\n\nAt Independence, several employees said the company has communicated the hybrid policy as a strict requirement of three full, eight-hour days in the office. Several current and former employees said reviews have been mixed.\n\n\u201cIt depends on who you talk to. Some people love coming in,\u201d said an analyst for Independence. \u201cI\u2019m neutral on days that are busy and where I have meetings in person because then at least the purpose of being in the office is fulfilled ... But other days when I have a slower day, I am annoyed.\u201d\n\nDifferent departments seem to have different rules, the analyst added. \u201cIt creates a lot of frustration and drops in morale because there are no consistent flexibilities given across the board.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems like people have gotten used to it for the most part,\u201d said another employee, who has been at Independence since before the pandemic. But \u201cit\u2019s enforced unevenly, and they still haven\u2019t addressed some of that.\u201d\n\nOne former Independence employee said they left the company because of what felt like \u201cincreased micromanaging\u201d with the return-to-office mandate.\n\nIndependence human resources chief Alexandra Jorgensen said in a statement that the return to office was successful, and the company finds value in the hybrid arrangement.\n\n\u201cWe also recognize that everyone\u2019s situation is unique,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cOur associates are encouraged to work directly with their manager, just as they did before the hybrid model was in place, to discuss alternative flexible solutions that help support their personal needs while also meeting business requirements.\u201d\n\nAmy Piccola, a partner at the law firm Saul Ewing, works in the firm\u2019s Philadelphia office two or three days a week. Before the pandemic, she worked remotely \u201cvery rarely\u201d but now calls herself \u201ca convert to the hybrid way of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some times when it is just more efficient to cut out a commute,\u201d said Piccola, who lives in Bryn Mawr and uses SEPTA Regional Rail to get to the office. Now it\u2019s no big deal to meet a home repairman or get back to the suburbs for an early evening event.\n\n\u201cI have new appreciation for all of those things that I wouldn\u2019t schedule on weekdays or that would create stress,\u201d Piccola said.\n\nSaul Ewing has a \u201cfour-plus-four\u201d policy for hybrid work. Most employees are expected to be in the office every Wednesday and any four other days of the month.\n\nMeeting with clients outside of Saul Ewing offices or appearing in court counts toward those extra four days, said Chandra Kilgriff, the firm\u2019s chief talent officer. Kilgriff said the policy is \u201chere to stay,\u201d even as some large employers push for more time in the office.\n\n\u201cWe have no plans to dial back our flexibility or change our policy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a key differentiator for us in terms of recruiting and retaining talent.\u201d\n\nPiccola, the firm\u2019s Philadelphia managing partner, appreciates that commitment. \u201cGiving people autonomy, it builds respect,\u201d she said.\n\nPiccola noted that law firms are \u201cvery rarely at the cutting edge of corporate changes,\u201d but she\u2019s seen a shift at their firm toward emphasizing quality work over \u201cfacetime.\u201d Among clients in Philadelphia and nationwide, she said, she\u2019s seen a range of policies, from fully in-office (she works in higher education, where this is often a necessity) to various hybrid and remote arrangements.\n\nAbout 200 of the firm\u2019s 850 employees work in the region. The firm is planning an office move in Philadelphia, and it will be a smaller space, Piccola said. But it will still include individual attorney offices and span multiple floors, she said \u2014 not a full adoption of the open-floor-plan hoteling model.\n\nWhat is the future of work?\n\nExperts say the evolution of hybrid work is not complete.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of working mothers want flexible policies,\u201d said Liz Tenety, co-founder of parenting-focused media company Motherly, which recently published a report on the pressures facing caregivers who work. \u201cEven millennial men want family-friendly policies.\u201d\n\nThe Motherly report, titled \u201cMoms in the Sandwich Generation,\u201d focuses on professionals who with young children are also caring for older relatives. More than half of the dual-caregivers surveyed for the report said they had left a job due to caregiving responsibilities.\n\nA growing population of workers are caring for both younger and older relatives, the report said. And as more of their generation ascend into leadership roles, workplace flexibility will likely increase.\n\n\u201cWe need to start with leadership that acknowledges that most of the workers at any corporation are caregivers,\u201d Tenety said.\n\nWhile some prominent voices, like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, have decried remote work, linking it to poor work ethic or productivity, Tenety has noticed the opposite. Motherly, with 10 employees across the U.S., is fully remote.\n\nMotherly and other employers like it, Tenety said, have \u201cshown what is possible\u201d with remote-work flexibility. \u201cWe have seen the light.\u201d\n\nNicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economist who researches remote and hybrid work arrangements, has found that work-from-home time has stabilized at about 25% recently, compared to its peak of 60% during the pandemic.\n\nHybrid work is more profitable, Bloom said at a recent conference covered by workplace publication Allwork.Space, because it often allows companies to downsize their offices and reduce employee turnover.\n\nGenerally, the expense of being flexible with work arrangements is less than the cost of losing and replacing good employees due to inflexibility, said Ruth Veloria, chief strategy officer at University of Phoenix, which collaborated with Motherly on the sandwich generation report.\n\n\u201cThe tenure and expertise that people who have been in the workplace for a while have is really important to recognize,\u201d Veloria said.\n\nJust as many workers had settled into post-pandemic hybrid arrangements and commuting routines, SEPTA inched toward a fiscal cliff.\n\nThe area\u2019s transit system warned of possible \u201cdraconian cuts\u201d several years ago due to funding shortfalls. Gov. Josh Shapiro swooped in with a solution late last year to avoid a fare hike in 2025.\n\nBut now, as legislators in Harrisburg have yet to reach a budget that includes millions in additional transit funding, SEPTA is preparing for major reductions to bus, Regional Rail, Market-Frankford and Broad Street Lines, and trolleys. The first austerity measures are set to take hold later this month.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stress around cutting SEPTA,\u201d said the Comcast contracts employee.\n\nLeaders at three of the regions largest employers \u2014 University of Pennsylvania, Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Comcast \u2014 wrote in a commentary for The Inquirer about their \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the service cuts and how they will affect their workforces.\n\nJorgensen, of Independence, echoed that concern. She said employees \u201chave been encouraged to work directly with their manager if their commute is affected.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccess to a robust transit system is critical to many of our associates and members, who rely on SEPTA to get to and from work and other activities,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cWhile we hope an agreement will be reached, we have also advised our associates to begin preparing for rate increases and potential changes in service.\u201d",

      "text": "- JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told young workers \u201cyou can\u2019t learn working from your basement.\u201d And it\u2019s not just Gen Zers that benefit from face-time in the office, the Wall Street exec also said his 5-day in office mandate will help management and push workers to innovate.\nWall Street has shifted back to office times of old\u2014in-person five days a week, with staffers scrambling for desks and crowding around water coolers. JPMorgan\u2019s CEO Jamie Dimon, who instituted a strict RTO mandate in January, said it\u2019s all critical to the careers of Gen Z.\n\u201cIt is an apprenticeship system,\u201d Dimon said in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, while adding that in-office time ensures young staffers pick up best practices from their seniors. \u201cYou can\u2019t learn working from your basement.\u201d\nPlus, while some may be less than pleased about the mandate right now, he added, \u201cI think our employees will be happier over time.\u201d\nThe CEO has been outspoken on the return-to-office debate. But Dimon also understands the appeal of logging in from home; remote work can pan out well for some companies and certain roles. Dimon is just adamant that in-person is the best thing for his business\u2014and no one is swaying his choice.\n\u201cI gave a very detailed answer about why [work from home] doesn\u2019t work for young people, why it doesn\u2019t work for management, why it doesn\u2019t work for innovation,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cI completely applaud your right to not want to go to the office every day. But you\u2019re not going to tell JPMorgan what to do.\u201d\nJPMorgan declined Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\nInside JPMorgan\u2019s RTO battle\nIn January of this year, the JPMorgan CEO brought down the RTO hammer, and ordered his more than 300,000 employees to come back into the office five days a week. The choice was met with workforce outcry; 40% had been working on a hybrid schedule of three days a week in-office at the time. So employees of the $650 billion bank launched a public petition, calling on Dimon to keep the usual work model. It garnered nearly 2,000 signatures.\nOne month later, during a February JPMorgan town hall, the CEO had some words for the RTO backlash. Audio of the internal meeting was leaked, where the CEO criticized the petition and said there wasn\u2019t \u201ca god d-mn person\u201d he could reach on Fridays. He also pointed out that employees were distracted during \u201cf-cking Zoom\u201d calls.\nWhile Dimon admitted to Bloomberg that he \u201cemoted\u201d during that February town hall, he holds firm that he isn\u2019t totally pigeonholed in his view. The executive pointed out that the RTO mandate didn\u2019t cause huge negative shifts; he said there was no additional attrition, and that 10% of the company\u2019s jobs, like call center gigs, are still remote.\n\u201cI\u2019m not even against work from home\u2014I\u2019m against work from home [when] it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Dimon said.\nGen Z and their love for WFH\nIt makes sense why Gen Z is keen to log in from their coaches\u2014as the newest cohort of workers, many started their first full-time jobs during the COVID-19 era of remote work. It\u2019s become their normal, and they\u2019re desperate to keep it.\nPlus, for the most part, they\u2019re happy to go into the office, just not every day. Gen Z is the most likely generation to come into the office 3 days a week\u2014higher than millennials, Gen X, and baby boomers\u2014they still crave balance. Almost 40% of Gen Z and millennials would take a pay cut in order to have more work flexibility, like what they had during the pandemic. Going back into the office disrupts their cushy, remote schedule; after all, more than half of the young generation have put off work to finish a show they\u2019re watching.\n\u201cWhile [young workers] actively seek roles offering face-to-face engagement, they reject rigid office mandates, prioritizing flexibility in when and how they work,\u201d Lauren Winans, CEO and principal HR consultant at HR consulting firm Next Level Benefits, told Fortune."

      "text": "Independence Blue Cross changes its work-from-home policy, the latest big Philly employer to require more in-office days\nThe insurance company had been allowing most employees to work remote as much as they liked. Now, they'll be required onsite a majority of the work week.\nAbandoning what it called a \u201chybrid of choice\u201d model, Independence Blue Cross will soon require employees to be in the office three days per week, Tuesday through Thursday. The change is the latest move by a top Philly employer to bring workers into downtown office towers more consistently, nearly four years after the pandemic forced many people to work remotely.\nThe change in work policy will take effect for managers, directors, and supervisors on March 12, and for other employees on April 2. Employees were notified this week.\nThe new policy will apply to all employees designated as \u201chybrid,\u201d who number about 3,000. But there will be no change for roles previously deemed \u201crequired remote\u201d or \u201con-site essential,\u201d said executive vice president Crystal E. Ashby, who leads human resources, diversity, and communications functions.\n\u201cWe are confident that this workplace model will create even more opportunities for collaboration and innovation,\u201d Ashby said. \u201cFor 85 years, IBX has played a leading role in the region we call home, and we are invested in the continued success of Southeastern Pennsylvania today and in the future.\u201d\nIndependence is the 16th largest employer in Philadelphia. Its headquarters at 1901 Market St. houses about 2,500 employees. It moved into that spot in 1989 and bought the 45-floor property in June 2020.\nThe company has a customer and community experience center at 1919 Market St., and a satellite office in Plymouth Meeting. Its affiliate, AmeriHealth, is headquartered in Cranbury, N.J.\nThe health insurance company had previously described its model as \u201chybrid\u201d or \u201chybrid of choice.\u201d That arrangement \u201cprovides our associates with the flexibility to choose whether to work remotely, work in the office every day, or work in the office on certain days at their discretion,\u201d the company\u2019s website said. \u201cHowever, management may require our associates to work from Independence\u2019s physical office locations on certain occasions.\u201d\nThose who worked remotely were required to do so in Pennsylvania, Delaware, or New Jersey.\nHybrid workers will be expected to work in the office for the full day on in-office days, Ashby said, while acknowledging that \u201cassociates may need flexibility to handle business needs or personal matters during the preferred workdays, just as they have in the past.\u201d Employees should approach their managers about those situations, Ashby said.\nEmployees should also talk to their manager when they feel too sick to come to the office, but well enough to work from home, Ashby said. But generally, \u201cIf associates are sick, we want them to focus on getting better. Associates who are not feeling well enough to work will be expected to stay at home and use their PTO so they can recover.\u201d\nIndependence employees have taken to a nonpublic, internal online forum to express their concerns about the announcement, according to employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were internal. Workers were surprised at the sudden change in policy after nearly four years being able to work remotely, and some worried about the challenges they may face in securing child care. One person posted to Reddit about the policy, saying the policy change was especially difficult for people who had children within the last four years.\nWhat are other hybrid work policies in Philadelphia?\nSince COVID-19-related business shutdowns began nearly four years ago, many of Philadelphia\u2019s largest employers have asked workers to return to regular in-person work at least part-time. Some have increased that requirement over the past year.\nComcast, which has about 8,000 Philadelphia employees, shifted to a schedule of four days in the office per week in September. The company announced the change, an increase of one in-office day from the previous policy, in late June, and stressed that flexibility would still be allowed.\nFor employers whose functions can be done remotely, hybrid arrangements seem to have emerged as the most popular long-term plan, but the specifics have varied widely.\nEmployment has grown in the region, but the number of workers present downtown remained lower last year than pre-pandemic, Center City District reported in December. The number of nonresident workers physically present in Center City averaged just under 100,000 per day in November, the organization said, which is 73% of 2019 levels."

      "text": "Everything we know about how SEPTA could change on Aug. 24\nSEPTA warns of possible overcrowding on buses as a result of the cuts in routes. Less frequent trips for buses, subway, trolley, and Regional Rail also could affect reliability.\nSEPTA\u2019s austerity version is set to launch in the early hours of Sunday, Aug. 24.\nThe following Monday morning, the enormity of a 20% cut in transit service and a big fare increase will hit most SEPTA riders for the first time, including thousands of Philadelphia students on their first day of school.\nSEPTA warns of possible overcrowding on buses, leading to more bypassed stops. Reduced subway and trolley runs could bring crush-level crowds. Buses, subways, trolleys, and Regional Rail trains would come less frequently during off-peak times.\nSEPTA has a $213 million operating deficit for the 2026 fiscal year, which began July 1.\nSome details could change. General manager Scott A. Sauer has said SEPTA in early August will post and print timetables that reflect the first set of cuts.\nHere\u2019s what we know so far:\nQuick look\nFares\nSEPTA says it will raise fares 21.5% across the board on all its services, including weekly and monthly passes. The one-way base price is set to rise from $2.50 to $2.90. The fare increase takes effect on Sept. 1.\nLeaders of the Republican majority in the state Senate, many of them skeptical about raising mass-transit funding, have said SEPTA should help itself with higher fare revenue.\nBus\nThe vast bus network, which carries more passengers than any other SEPTA service, would see some of the biggest cuts.\nIn all, 32 bus routes are scheduled to be eliminated. They are routes 1, 8, 12, 19, 30, 31, 35, 47M, 50, 62, 73, 78, 80, 88, 89, 91, 106, 120, 126, 133, 150, 201, 204, 206, 311, 452, 461, 462, 476, 478, 484, and BLVDDIR.\nAlso being cut are special routes, such as the Mann Loop for concerts at the Mann Center in Fairmount Park, as well as those for sports and other events.\nRoutes will be shortened on 16 bus lines: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 17, 27, 43, 61, 84, 115, 124, 125, 433, 441, and 495.\nOn the remaining routes the time between buses, known as headways, would lengthen, particularly during the midday hours. That means fewer trips and fewer buses running each route.\nBuses currently scheduled to run at 10-minute intervals in the midday would instead arrive every 15 minutes. Twenty-minute headways would turn into 30 minutes. Routes with midday intervals of 40, 45, 50, and 60 minutes would remain the same.\n\u00bb READ MORE: A day on SEPTA\u2019s 31 bus, one of dozens that may soon be cut\nRegional Rail\nA normal schedule would have 1,414 weekly trips spread across SEPTA\u2019s 13 Regional Rail lines, SEPTA says. That is close to the current levels.\nService would drop to 960 weekly trips under the reduced schedule, about one-third fewer.\nMost midday riders during the workweek will see intervals between Regional Rail trains increase from one hour to two hours.\nSome peak-travel trips may be cut, but planners have tried to preserve as many of those as possible, spokesperson Andrew Busch said. That means midday trips were cut significantly.\nThe Airport line would change from half-hour to hourly service throughout the day.\nRegional Rail service cuts take effect on Sept. 2.\nMarket-Frankford and Broad Street Lines\nFewer trains would run during midday periods.\nOn the El, trains would be scheduled to arrive every eight minutes in the midday, vs. the current six minutes.\nBSL trains would arrive every nine minutes, compared with the current seven-minute intervals.\nTrolleys\nHeadways for the T2 (Route 34), T3 (Route 13), and T5 (Route 36) trolleys would be increased to every 15 minutes, from 10 minutes, in the midday hours.\nThe midday frequency of trolleys on T1 (formerly Route 10) and T4 (formerly Route 11) would drop to every 12 minutes from 10 minutes.\nThe two trolley lines in Delco (new designation D) would see 25-minute headways, up from 20, during the midday.\nThe G line (a.k.a. the Route 15) would continue to run along Girard Avenue after Aug. 24, with the same mix of restored 1947 cream-and-green trolleys and buses that it uses now.\nBut its midday frequency would decrease to every 10 minutes from eight minutes. If proposed deeper Jan. 1 cuts are necessary, the G (15) would be served entirely by buses, SEPTA says.\nLast, but not least in the eyes of fans, the light-rail Norristown High Speed Line (to become M) will keep its rate of 15 minutes between trips.\nWhy is SEPTA making cuts?\nSEPTA says it must make the service cuts and hike fares because the state has underfunded it and other transit systems for years, as operating costs have jumped.\nIf needed, a deeper round of service reductions would begin Jan. 1, bringing the total to 45% less service than today\u2019s.\nGov. Josh Shapiro proposed $292 million a year for five years, raised by increasing the share of the sales tax devoted to public transit. SEPTA would get an estimated $168 million.\nThe state budget, which would include any new mass transit dollars, is more than 30 days overdue. Lawmakers and the administration are negotiating a budget, and a number of issues, not just transportation, remain sticking points."

      "text": "Mayor Parker announces that all city workers are expected in office five days a week\n\u201cEmployee presence at the workplace allows for more personal and productive interactions,\u201d Parker said when announcing the return-to-office policy.\nMayor Cherelle L. Parker announced Monday that all city workers are expected to work from the office five days a week, essentially returning employees to pre-pandemic scheduling, beginning July 15.\nParker has telegraphed since taking office in January that she planned to order employees to work in-person full time, a departure from former Mayor Jim Kenney, who largely left hybrid work decisions up to individual department heads.\nBut Parker has asked the leaders of the city\u2019s largest employers to bring their workers back to the office, in part to buoy the fortunes of Center City, where weekday foot traffic has yet to recover to 2019 levels. Her announcement Monday was applauded by business leaders and advocates for development in Center City, but it was immediately criticized by one of the city\u2019s largest municipal unions, which said the mayor unilaterally implemented the new rule without negotiating it.\nParker said that about 80% of the city\u2019s 26,000-member workforce was already working from an office or on-site, and that bringing all workers back would foster stronger collaboration.\n\u201cEmployee presence at the workplace allows for more personal and productive interactions,\u201d Parker said during a news conference Monday. \u201cIt facilitates communication. It promotes social connections, along with collaboration, innovation, and inclusion.\u201d\nPaul Levy, who chairs the board of the Center City District, described the policy as beneficial for workers and for the vibrancy of Center City.\n\u201cThe presence of all workers in offices downtown supports retail and restaurants and provides jobs for SEPTA workers, maintenance, and other support staff who keep buildings operating safely,\u201d Levy said. \u201cQuite simply, remote work and inclusive growth are incompatible.\u201d\nBut city workers pushed back, saying an end to hybrid work would lead to decreased morale. The new policy was not agreed to by the municipal unions, and leaders of AFSCME\u2019s District Council 47, which represents many of the professional and supervisory employees, said their members are frustrated.\nDavid Wilson, president of AFSCME Local 2187, District Council 47, argued that starting the policy over the summer when children are out of school is likely to complicate schedules for many parents.\n\u201cShe\u2019s the mayor of the people, but she doesn\u2019t seem to really care for city workers,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cParents have worked their schedules around children\u2019s summer camp plans and now all of a sudden this mayor is going to throw a big old wrench in that.\u201d\nWilson said the union believes the return-to-office policy should be subject to collective bargaining. He said the union met with the administration to discuss the subject once and had another session scheduled for Thursday, adding: \u201cTo hear that the city is going to unilaterally move forward without continuing their bargaining sessions is disheartening.\u201d\nThe mayor said she does not believe an in-office mandate is subject to collective bargaining. Parker said the workforce was \u201cat the center\u201d of her decision-making process.\nLast month, chief administrative officer Camille Duchaussee testified to City Council that the city would negotiate with the unions to add more supports for employees.\n\u201cI am mindful of my responsibilities under labor law to have some of these conversations with the union,\u201d Duchaussee said. \u201cWe are looking broadly at how we can mitigate any concerns, how we can increase value to our employees\u2019 compensation, and how we can ensure that as our employees return to the office, we have created a culture that supports them.\u201d\nOn Monday, Duchaussee said the administration has already made worker-friendly adjustments, including extending paid parental leave from six to eight weeks and designating the Friday after Thanksgiving as a holiday. There will also be relaxed restrictions on the use of sick leave for family members.\nStill, Gennifer E. Reed, president of AFSCME Local 2186, District Council 47, said the new policy could cause an exodus of city workers amid an already dire understaffing crisis. Nearly a quarter of city jobs were vacant as of April following a wave of pandemic-era resignations and retirements.\n\u201cThe members are incensed,\u201d Reed said. \u201cPeople are really, really upset. People who were going to wait to retire want to retire now.\u201d\nAt least one other employer aimed to take advantage of Parker\u2019s new policy Monday: Montgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija posted on X that Montgomery County allows for hybrid work, saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re an excellent public servant and you want to work from home sometimes, come to Montco.\u201d\nSome labor leaders \u2014 albeit not those who represent city workers \u2014 expressed support for the policy. They include Ryan Boyer, a close Parker ally who heads the Philadelphia Building & Construction Trades Council, and Gabe Morgan, a vice president of the Service Employees International Union 32BJ, which represents thousands of workers, including custodians and security officers whose jobs rely on a vibrant Center City.\nBoth labor groups supported Parker when she ran for mayor last year.\n\u201cOur union men and women have been working on-site and on the job throughout this time of COVID, and we welcome city workers back,\u201d Morgan said in a statement shortly after the mayor addressed the union\u2019s convention earlier in the day.\nAfter COVID-19 vaccines rolled out in 2021, Kenney\u2019s administration required workers back in the office only two days a week and, in practice, left the decision to individual departments. The result was a range of work-from-home policies across the city government, with some only required in-person a few times a month.\nParker ran on ending that patchwork of policies and returning to the pre-pandemic status quo. She and her allies also argued that returning to the office is an equity issue and that many city workers have never had the opportunity to work from home.\nNationally, across all sectors, only 10% of American workers are fully remote and an additional 10% work hybrid, partly from home and partly from an office.\nParker insists that a return-to-office policy will be better for the city and its government in the long run.\n\u201cFor the Parker administration, we are at war with the status quo right now,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we want to ensure that we have done everything we could to ensure that our workers have the supports they need as we work to implement this policy.\u201d\nInquirer staff writer Sean Collins Walsh contributed to this article."

      "text": "Gov. Shapiro secures $153 million for SEPTA, averting fare hike planned for 2025\nGov. Shapiro announced the cash infusion on Friday. A 7.5% fare increase for all SEPTA riders will still go into effect on Dec. 1.\nGov. Josh Shapiro, in a moment suggestive of last year\u2019s fast rebuild of a collapsed I-95 bridge, swooped into Philadelphia Friday to announce he was redirecting $153 million in federal highway funds to SEPTA, averting a significant fare increase planned for Jan. 1.\nThe cash amounts to a fiscal life preserver for the sixth-largest mass transit system in the U.S., after the Pennsylvania legislature failed to pass Shapiro\u2019s proposal for a longer-lasting increase in subsidies for public transportation.\n\u201cI want to step up and create a bridge, some time and space, for the House and Senate to be able to work together, to come together on this issue of funding mass transit,\u201d Shapiro said at a Frankford Transportation Center news conference attended by Mayor Cherelle L. Parker and an array of the Philadelphia region\u2019s elected and appointed officials.\nEarlier this month, SEPTA moved to enact a 29% across-the-board fare increase followed by deep service cuts next summer, as the agency grapples with what officials call an \u201cunprecedented\u201d post-pandemic financial crisis. It faces a recurring deficit of $240 million annually.\nWhile Shapiro\u2019s efforts have paused the 21.5% fare increase expected for Jan. 1, riders will still face an increase of 7.5% beginning Dec. 1. Shapiro said the federal cash infusion would limit service cuts, but did not provide further detail.\nSqueezed by high inflation, the end of federal pandemic aid and reduced ridership because of remote work, SEPTA says it needs new (and predictable) state funding to sustain operations and retool services for the evolving needs of today\u2019s riders. Other transit agencies in Pennsylvania and across the nation face similar fiscal challenges.\nMonths, not years, of stability\nStates have used the move Shapiro has triggered, known as \u201cflexing,\u201d since the 1980s to aid transit agencies by taking money earmarked for highway projects.\nAt a similar time of peril for transit in 2005, Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell redirected $412 million in federal highway funds to keep buses and trains moving in Southeastern Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh for two years. SEPTA\u2019s then-$49.2 million deficit \u2014 roughly equivalent to today\u2019s gap in inflation-adjusted terms \u2014 was wiped out instantly.\nSEPTA welcomed the temporary boost as a reprieve from a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of steep fare hikes and drastic service cuts, but acknowledged it still must have a share of a steady source of new funding for state transit agencies.\nThe flex is a \u201cstopgap\u201d but gives SEPTA needed relief through June 30, said Erik Johanson, the agency\u2019s senior director of budgets and innovation. \u201cIt\u2019s not the dedicated funding we\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said, though he\u2019s grateful. \u201cIt buys you months, not years.\u201d\nRobbing Peter to pay Paul?\nSenate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Ind.) and the caucus\u2019 main negotiator on budget issues said in an interview before Shapiro\u2019s announcement that he \u201cappreciates the governor\u2019s need to take care of his own political backyard,\u201d but using the federal funds set aside for highway infrastructure projects elsewhere won\u2019t help Republicans and Democrats reach a long-term solution.\n\u201cFlexing these dollars, No. 1, sends a message that the governor cares more about transit than he does infrastructure, and No. 2, doesn\u2019t seem interested in sitting down and figuring out how we collaborate on real solutions to these issues,\u201d Pittman added. \u201cRobbing Peter to pay Paul is not the answer.\u201d\nState Senate Republicans have blocked Shapiro\u2019s proposal to raise $1.5 billion over five years for transit operations by allocating more sales tax revenue to the Public Transportation Trust Fund. SEPTA, as the largest system, would receive about $161 million annually under that plan.\nThe state House, which has a Democratic majority, passed bills to provide that money three times, but they have stalled in the Senate in part because of internal disagreements among the Republicans who control the chamber about how to pay for it.\nFirst, the GOP senators wanted new transit funding tied to new funding for roads and bridges in an overarching deal. Shapiro agreed to work on that approach.\nSenate Republicans say the sales tax alone is not enough to compensate for transit\u2019s funding woes, and the state has its own pocketbook to worry about as costs continue to outpace revenue in the state budget. Pittman has floated using skill games \u2014 slot-machine look-alikes proliferating in convenience stores, bars and corner bodegas \u2014 as a revenue stream. Democrats have not offered any other alternative plan \u2014 skill games or otherwise \u2014 to find new revenue streams, Pittman added.\nBut the Republican state Senate caucus is divided over what rate of tax to charge skill games, whose owners and manufacturers want to pay less and brick-and-mortar casinos, which are heavily taxed and want the upstart competitors to pay more.\nShapiro has said he is open to the possibility of using skill games as a revenue source. \u201cBut the Senate didn\u2019t get it done,\u201d the governor said Friday. \u201cI\u2019m not here today to point any fingers, because I\u2019m just saying facts.\u201d\nSEPTA\u2019s financial crunch is \u201ca crisis of his own making,\u201d Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward, the top Republican in the chamber, said of Shapiro, arguing it stemmed from his own priorities in state budget deliberations.\n\u201cGov. Shapiro and House Democrats prioritized education over mass transit by approving the largest budget increase ever for a traditional education system that continues to trap Philadelphia\u2019s kids in failing schools,\u201d Ward said. Both Democrats and Republicans were tasked by a state court to invest more money equitably across districts, after finding the long-standing system unconstitutional.\nFinding the money\nSEPTA\u2019s $153 million will come from seven different interstate infrastructure projects across the state, said state Transportation Secretary Mike Carroll: on I-79 in Mercer County; I-80 in Columbia County; I-95 in Philadelphia; on I-83 in York County; two I-80 projects in Jefferson County and another on I-70 in Washington County.\nChanging the money from those projects to SEPTA must be authorized by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, the federally designated metropolitan planning organization that decides the state\u2019s Transportation Improvement Plan, Johanson said.\nThen the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Agency have to approve, and the money is shifted to FTA and given as a grant for preventive maintenance, which allows spending of federal money for local operating expenses, he said.\n\u201cThe projects will only be delayed, not canceled,\u201d Carroll said, adding that the work has not even been put out to bid yet.\nBut transportation funding has often been fraught in Pennsylvania and other states with big urban centers amid rural areas, and huge needs for both road and bridge repairs and public transportation and usually not enough to make everyone happy.\nRendell faced political blowback from Republican lawmakers by using the flex option in 2005 and again in 2010, when he redirected a smaller amount of highway money to Pittsburgh\u2019s struggling transit authority. The move appeared to pit rural drivers against urban transit users. At one point, legislation was introduced to prohibit such transfers.\nShapiro reminded the several hundred people inside the bus depot that his administration has negotiated $330.5 million in additional state funding in for roads and bridges with both parties.\nNaomi Wildflower, a Kensington social worker, testified Thursday on a City Council resolution supporting a flex, which passed. Her family does not own a car.\n\u201cEven though I barely use state highways, a staggering amount of my tax dollars go towards them,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I am asking Gov. Shapiro to use highway flex funds to support the hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians who rely on SEPTA, even if there are many more Pennsylvanians who do not use it at all.\u201d"

      "text": "\u2018Existential threat\u2019\nPhilly employers, workers, and small business owners are \u2018horrified\u2019 by the possibility of steep SEPTA cuts.\nAt Reading Terminal Market, CEO Annie Allman says, there\u2019s a common refrain among merchants during bad weather: \u201cIf SEPTA is running, the market is open.\u201d\nNow, Allman said, the phrase seems foreboding. What will happen if SEPTA reduces service, eliminating dozens of bus and Regional Rail lines?\nShe is \u201chorrified\u201d by the possibility.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never used the phrase existential threat as much,\u201d said Allman, who is CEO and general manager of the nonprofit Reading Terminal Market Corp. \u201cThis would just cripple Philadelphia, and it also would crush the market.\u201d\nThe proposed cuts, announced last month, would slash the transit agency\u2019s service by 45%, with reductions beginning this fall. Trains and buses would run less frequently, and 55 bus routes and five Regional Rail lines would be eliminated entirely.\nThat could all be avoided if the Pennsylvania legislature manages to pass Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2018s latest proposal to increase state aid for mass transit systems. Monday was the first day of public budget hearings, and SEPTA users lined up to testify. The state budget deadline is June 30.\nPhilly leaders, commuters, and even the city\u2019s pro sports teams have expressed \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about the planned cuts.\nTraffic projections have shown the move would result in longer commutes, with about 275,000 more people driving into Philadelphia daily. Several employers and business leaders said they worry there is not enough parking in the city to accommodate them.\nInside the largely empty concourse at Suburban Station, SEPTA\u2019s potential cuts loom over the few remaining business owners, who say foot traffic and sales are a fraction of what they were pre-pandemic.\nAnd in the office buildings that tower over Center City, the possibility complicates the debate around return-to-office policies.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need any more deterrence to come into the city,\u201d said Brenton Hutchinson, chair of the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) of Philadelphia. \u201cWe want to see something resolved, and sooner the better, so that there\u2019s no disruptions.\u201d\nThe impact of the proposed cuts would be \u201cso far-reaching and so deep,\u201d said Chellie Cameron, president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia. SEPTA connects suburban residents to their jobs in the city, and city dwellers to suburban offices, Cameron said. Consumers, patients, and students also rely on SEPTA.\nIf cuts are implemented, \u201cit\u2019s gonna fracture the connections that we have between the city and the suburbs,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s really the underpinning of the success of our economy.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we start to talk about bigger issues like upward economic mobility, and how we continue to create good-paying jobs for people,\u201d she added, \u201chow are we gonna do that if [the system] we actually rely upon to connect our region together is fractured?\u201d\nPhilly workers would be \u2018tremendously affected\u2019\nScores of Philadelphia workers would have their daily lives upended by SEPTA cuts.\n\u201cYou will be adding hours to people\u2019s commutes every week,\u201d Cameron said, \u201cand that doesn\u2019t just impact their ability to get into work. It impacts their ability to access childcare, to pick their kids up from school.\u201d\nBusinesses are afraid of losing employees because of these ancillary impacts, she said.\nEmployees of Philadelphia libraries, water and sanitation departments, and other municipal services will be \u201ctremendously affected,\u201d by the proposed cuts, said Greg Boulware, president of their union, AFSCME District Council 33.\n\u201cThis will impact their ability to get to and from work and provide the services that the city of Philadelphia needs for all its residents,\u201d said Boulware, who represents around 10,000 workers.\nDC33 members are feeling \u201ca huge amount of frustration,\u201d he said. Some are talking about using Uber or Lyft to get to work, but Boulware calls that an added expense \u201cfor workers that don\u2019t make enough money as it is.\u201d\nAt Comcast, leaders are \u201cdiscussing the challenges the planned cuts could bring,\u201d spokesperson John Demming said.\nAnd at Philadelphia International Airport, \u201cReliable mass transit makes working at the airport a viable option for many individuals,\u201d airport officials said in a statement shared by a PHL spokesperson.\nA setback to return-to-office policies\nFive years after COVID-19 shutdowns forced many professionals to work from home, some Philadelphia employers are still pushing to get their employees back in the office more often. SEPTA\u2019s woes are another hurdle for those ambitions.\nAlthough some workers have argued in favor of continued remote or hybrid work for myriad reasons, dramatic reductions in SEPTA service are seen by employers as the most reasonable argument against return-to-office efforts.\nBrandywine Realty Trust, one of the region\u2019s predominant office owners, reports that 50% to 60% of its tenants\u2019 workers use mass transit, even as public transportation usage never fully recovered from the pandemic.\n\u201cIf mass transit schedules are impacted, the issue is: Can they bring people back into work?\u201d said Jerry Sweeney, CEO of Brandywine.\nIn the event of cuts, Sweeney said, some of Brandywine\u2019s tenants are considering reserving additional parking, or modifying work hours so employees could commute at off-peak times.\n\u201cThe world of business today is already complicated with the macroeconomic climate,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cThis is something that no business needs.\u201d\nPhiladelphia\u2019s office market took a blow during the pandemic, and it has not recovered. The number of workers in offices in the core West Market Street district at the end of 2024 was only 63% of what it was in 2019. (That\u2019s 11% higher than 2023.)\nA report from real estate brokerage Colliers showed that in the first quarter of 2025, office vacancy ticked up in both Philadelphia and the suburbs, although it remains higher outside the city.\nSome office market analysts speculate that the proposed SEPTA cuts could make suburban office buildings more appealing, because it would be easier for workers who live in the suburbs to drive to locations outside Center City, where parking is more plentiful.\nImpact on Reading Terminal Market\nSome businesses with deep roots in Philadelphia will be left to deal with the fallout of SEPTA cuts if they occur.\nReading Terminal Market sits atop SEPTA\u2019s Jefferson Station, where Regional Rail passengers catch trains, walking distance from several bus stops and subway stations.\nMonday through Thursday, Reading Terminal serves about 16,000 customers on average, said Allman, the CEO. That\u2019s up from 14,500 at this time last year, before the city implemented its return-to-office mandate.\nAnd \u201cthe bulk\u201d of the market\u2019s 600 employees rely on public transit, she said.\nAllman does not know yet how the market would respond to SEPTA cuts. It may have to adjust operating hours.\n\u201cBetween all the good news of rising egg prices, and tariffs, and lack of international visitors this summer, I haven\u2019t really gotten to forecasting,\u201d she said with a laugh.\nFor now, however, Reading Terminal is thriving, with nearly full occupancy, Allman said.\nAcross the street at the Fashion District, occupancy is lower, but dozens of businesses are humming along, fueled by steady foot traffic.\nSuburban Station business owners worry\nA few blocks away at Suburban Station, the scene is different, with more at stake for business owners if transit is cut.\nThe sprawling underground concourse, a bustling corridor on weekdays pre-pandemic, now has more closed storefronts than operating businesses.\nOn a recent Thursday morning, foot traffic was light, and conversations with about half a dozen business owners and managers painted a grim picture of their potential future. More than 6,200 square feet of retail space is for lease, while several other large storefronts simply sit vacant, apparently not on the market.\nBusiness owners said sales are 20% to 50% of what they were before the pandemic. The concourse is so bleak, one business owner said, that commuters are increasingly exiting at the first opportunity, instead of walking farther underground and passing the stores as they once did.\nSome owners expressed concern that SEPTA cuts could worsen their situations, both by decimating the already-thin foot traffic and by making it harder for their employees to get to work. It would be just the latest blow.\n\u201cWe survived, kind of,\u201d said Michael Choi, manager of Penn Center Beauty Supply, referring to the pandemic. But business now is \u201cslow, very slow.\u201d\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been good ever since COVID,\u201d said Kris Kim, owner of DBA Happy Jewelry. Pre-pandemic, the store would see more than 50 customers a day. Now, Kim said, they\u2019re lucky if a dozen people come in.\nWhen it comes to the future, \u201cwe\u2019re worried.\u201d"

      "text": "In Philly, the hybrid-work wars aren\u2019t over yet. Battles wage beyond City Hall.\nMore employers have brought workers back to the office with increasing frequency this year, and they hope to continue the trend next year.\nEarly this year, Mayor Cherelle L. Parker announced that the City of Philadelphia would require its workers to return to the office five days a week.\nThe policy change was meant to improve public services, increase a sense of safety in Center City, and convince private-sector employers to bring their workers back to the office and downtown Philadelphia full time.\nHybrid work accommodations have become less widely available over the last two years, and employees of major firms are worried that the days of work-from-home flexibility are dying out.\nOne Comcast employee said there are fears about a five-day in-office mandate because of Parker\u2019s policy. \u201cOnce the city went to five days, there was definitely a panic in Comcast because the city relies pretty heavily on the business Comcast employees bring in.\u201d When asked for comment, Comcast said, \u201cWe do not have plans to go to five days a week.\u201d\nThe Comcast employee and other office workers who spoke with The Inquirer are not named in this article because of their concern about job security.\nBased on interviews with a dozen office workers and managers in Philadelphia and its collar counties, the work-from-home debate is far from settled. U.S. Census Bureau data showed the ranks of remote workers \u2014 defined as those who work at least partially from home \u2014 in Philadelphia shrinking from 19.4% in 2022 to 16.2% in 2023.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last 18 months is a slow but increasingly decided move back to full-time in the office,\u201d said Milton Corsey, director of human capital solutions at AchieveNEXT, a Wayne-based HR consultancy that works with dozens of companies in the region. \u201cThe trend has been clear. Ultimately, the goal is a return back to pre-pandemic for a lot of places.\u201d\nThroughout President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, employers have acted cautiously because of a tight labor market that empowered workers who could more easily find a new job.\nA hybrid option is still a strong incentive companies can use to secure talent. At the same time, managers and owners like to work from home, too. In many industries, norms may have simply changed too much since 2020 to require full-time in-office employment.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing this battle between the employee and the employer,\u201d said Sarah McDaniel, employee benefits executive at AssuredPartners, an insurance broker that works with hundreds of local employers. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if [hybrid work is fully] reversible. At the end of the day, the employer has to remain competitive and get the best talent.\u201d\nThe accelerating atrophy of hybrid work\nAfter the COVID-19 vaccines debuted in early 2021, many office-based employers eased into return-to-office policies and maintained a hybrid work schedule. Three days in and two days at home proved a popular model, which also allowed employers signing new leases to seek smaller but more expensive and higher-quality office space.\nStarting in 2023, major employers like Comcast and health insurer Independence Blue Cross began requiring more days in the office. The trend continued into 2024, and local public-sector employers like SEPTA and Parker\u2019s administration joined the trend of a more intensive in-office policy.\nOffice boosters say that trend is still gaining momentum.\n\u201cThe mayor showed a great deal of courage by bringing people back to the office five days a week, and we\u2019re seeing more and more companies do that,\u201d said Jerry Sweeney, CEO of Brandywine Realty Trust, the region\u2019s dominant owner of office buildings.\nIn the early days of return-to-office policies, Mondays and Fridays were the most common work-from-home days, while in-office time was typically in the middle of the week.\nBut now, \u201cin our inventory, the traffic we\u2019re seeing on Monday in our offices is much higher than it was on Tuesdays a year ago,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of working our way back.\u201d\nThe European business software company SAP, with almost 3,000 workers in the Philadelphia area, is an example of this recent trend. It offered greater hybrid flexibility than most other companies before the pandemic, but in early 2024, it instituted a three-day in-office policy.\nSAP is also an example of the nuances of return-to-office policies. The pushback to three days a week was immediate, as employees felt betrayed by a company that had long allowed more remote work. The company granted flexibility within the mandate, specifically for workers hired before or during the pandemic or who live more than 40 miles from the office in Newtown Square, Delaware County.\nAccording to an SAP spokesperson, the company offers temporary exceptions to the in-office requirements for both business and personal reasons. A similar exception process will be available (but not guaranteed) for any new hires or those planning to move farther than 40 miles from Newtown Square. No further alterations of the hybrid policy are are planned.\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have managers in the same office as them, so there\u2019s no one policing it,\u201d said one SAP employee. \u201cThey haven\u2019t gotten strict yet about checking to make sure who\u2019s in and who\u2019s not.\u201d\nWorkers at other companies agree that implementing in-office policies is more nuanced than employers admit. Mandates issued thus far are often riddled with exceptions, with much dependent on individual managers and some workers allowed to maintain full-time remote work if given special dispensation.\nSome industries, such as finance, have returned full-time, while others, like tech and law, have been more likely to stick with hybrid schedules. Fridays in the skyscraper canyons of Center City or on office-lined Swedesford Road in Wayne still feel like a pre-pandemic Saturday.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any [policies] that are actually ironclad,\u201d said McDaniel of AssuredPartners. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard of any company locally or regionally that\u2019s put out a firm, blanket policy that isn\u2019t being adjusted as needed to keep good talent.\u201d\nNew president, new economy, new office policies\nHeading into 2025, some office market observers see that changing.\nThe historically tight job market has been showing signs of fraying, weakening workers\u2019 bargaining power. In 2020 many business leaders hoped remote work would boost employee productivity, and it may have done so for a time, but federal government data show that was a fairly short-lived phenomenon \u2014 and employers are doubting whether sitting at home actually allows their staffs to accomplish more.\nCorsey at AchieveNEXT says some clients are considering ending hybrid work as customers complain about poor service from home-based workers.\nOffice-minded employers have supporters in President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and a close ally of the incoming administration. Both are remote-work foes planning a new push to bring federal workers back to the office full-time.\n\u201cWith the election, there\u2019s this promise of the return to the norm and pushing from the highest levels of government to encourage that to happen,\u201d McDaniel said.\nSome Philadelphia-area office workers do not believe that their employers\u2019 current hybrid work policies are set in stone either.\nAt a recent IBX company town hall, managers told employees that they are not looking to change the current Tuesday-through-Thursday in-office regimen, but workers there said they saw the statement as a temporary stance, not a permanent guarantee.\n\u201cI am worried they will mandate a five-day RTO, especially given that the city has a five-day in-office policy,\u201d one IBX worker said. \u201cFor 2025, I could comfortably guess that they will not change the policy. For 2026 and on, though, I am not so sure.\u201d\nEmployers who have been lenient about their return-to-office policies are beginning to crack down. Workers at Comcast reported that badge swipes are checked more assiduously and that lenient managers are being forced to get tougher.\nMuch depends on the job market. The Philadelphia-area unemployment rate is still at a historically low 3.6%, but many of the employees interviewed felt they would have a tough time finding an equivalent job.\nThat could embolden employers to further roll back hybrid work.\n\u201cThe winds shifted in the past year or two. It\u2019s more of an employer\u2019s market at this point,\u201d said one Vanguard employee. \u201cI feel like [Vanguard leaders] know there would be a lot of pushback, but the job market is changing, so hopefully they don\u2019t take advantage of that.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with information from SAP."

      "text": "- Remote work has stabilized at 25% of workdays and isn\u2019t declining, despite dramatic media headlines.\n- Data proves hybrid work boosts retention and profit without hurting performance.\n- Clear coordination is key, because successful hybrid models require structured, team-based office days.\nIf you\u2019ve been doom-scrolling headlines proclaiming the \u201cdeath of remote work,\u201d Stanford economist Nick Bloom has one message for you: don\u2019t believe the hype.\nSpeaking live at the Running Remote 2025 conference, Bloom brought his signature mix of wit and data to dismantle the most persistent myths about remote and hybrid work.\nFrom Zoom\u2019s alleged return-to-office mandate to Amazon\u2019s controversial RTO push, he exposed how sensational media headlines have distorted a simple truth: work from home has stabilized, and it\u2019s not going anywhere.\nThe Media Says It\u2019s Over. The Data Says Otherwise\nBloom explained the following:\n\u201cWork from home peaked at over 60% of working days during the pandemic,\u201d\n\u201cToday, it\u2019s stabilized at around 25% \u2014 and that figure hasn\u2019t budged in two years.\u201d\nIn other words, remote work has simply settled into a new normal rather than vanishing.\nBloom shared data from three separate sources \u2014 surveys, building access records (Kastle), and cell phone tracking (Placer.ai) \u2014 all pointing to the same conclusion: the number of remote workdays in the U.S. has plateaued.\nDespite media narratives suggesting a widespread return to the office, the evidence tells a very different story.\nSo why the disconnect?\n\u201cMedia incentives are driving the drama,\u201d said Bloom.\n\u201cHeadlines like \u2018The End of Remote Work\u2019 get clicks. Stories that say \u2018It\u2019s Still the Same\u2019 don\u2019t.\u201d\nThere\u2019s Proof Of Hybrid Work\u2019s Popularity and Profitability\nOne of the most compelling moments of the keynote came when Bloom broke down the results of a groundbreaking A/B test with Trip.com, a global, publicly traded travel company.\nThe study randomly assigned employees to two groups: one worked in-office five days a week; the other worked hybrid (three in-office days, two remote).\nAfter two years of tracking metrics, the results were clear:\n- No performance difference between the two groups.\n- 35% reduction in quit rates among hybrid workers.\n- Estimated $20 million annual profit increase due to reduced turnover and office space needs.\n\u201cThis is not just about employee happiness,\u201d Bloom emphasized. \u201cIt\u2019s a bottom-line issue. Hybrid work is highly profitable.\u201d\nThe Secret to Making Hybrid Work? Coordination\nDespite hybrid work\u2019s benefits, many organizations are still struggling to get it right. Why? According to Bloom, it comes down to poor coordination.\n\u201cPeople want to come into the office to collaborate and socialize,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re forcing people in on random days when their team isn\u2019t there, what\u2019s the point?\u201d\nThe takeaway is that hybrid policies must be coordinated and enforced consistently. Unclear or overly flexible schedules lead to empty offices, frustrated employees, and wasted resources.\nBloom contrasted the IMF (with a clear Tuesday-Thursday policy that works) against the World Bank (a four-day \u201csuggestion\u201d that few follow).\nThe IMF\u2019s tight structure worked. The World Bank\u2019s looser one didn\u2019t.\nA Global Snapshot And A Big Opportunity\nBloom also shared global remote work trends from a 22-country survey.\nEnglish-speaking countries lead the way, with the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia reporting the highest levels of remote work. Europe isn\u2019t far behind, while Asia still lags \u2014 a trend Bloom called \u201ca policy failure.\u201d\n\u201cThese are dense, expensive cities with long commutes,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEncouraging remote work could improve quality of life, boost productivity, and even raise fertility rates in countries struggling with population decline.\u201d\n\ud83d\udd2e Looking Ahead at What the Next Decade Holds\nWhile Bloom sees no major changes in remote work policy over the next 12 months \u2014 even in the event of a recession \u2014 he\u2019s bullish on the long-term outlook.\n\u201cTechnology will only get better,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom video conferencing to virtual reality, the tools are evolving. And as leases expire, more companies will downsize and embrace hybrid models.\u201d\nHe closed with a historical chart tracing work from home rates back to 1965, showing a steady, exponential rise long before the pandemic accelerated the trend.\n\u201cLooking five to ten years out,\u201d Bloom said.\n\u201cRemote work levels are going to rise again.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the clearest forecast I can give.\nRemote work is a permanent fixture of the modern workforce, and for companies still resisting it, the data clearly shows that a hybrid model is a smart and viable business strategy.\nWatch the full video recap:"

      "text": "JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon talks tariffs and the possibility of a recession\nIn a visit to Philadelphia to receive an award, the influential CEO raised concerns about the uncertain economy and getting workers back to the office.\nThe day President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping new taxes on U.S. imports took effect last month, JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon told a television interviewer that a recession was \u201clikely.\u201d\nHours later, Trump announced a 90-day pause on some of the steepest tariffs he\u2019d announced just a week earlier on what he dubbed \u201cLiberation Day\u201d \u2014 a policy that prompted turmoil in financial markets.\nSpeaking to reporters, the president said he had observed market volatility \u2014 and also had watched Dimon\u2019s interview on Fox Business.\nDimon, the chief executive of the biggest U.S. bank, is closely watched not just on Wall Street but also in Washington, D.C., for his economic insights.\nSo now, three weeks after Trump hit the brakes on a trade agenda he said would usher in an \u201ceconomic revolution,\u201d does Dimon still think a recession may come soon?\n\u201cI think what I said is that our economists think it\u2019s likely. \u2026 And it\u2019s probably still true,\u201d Dimon said in an interview Thursday in Philadelphia, where he was scheduled to receive an award for business leadership from the Franklin Institute.\n\u201cInflation will be a little higher. Growth will be a little slower. We\u2019ve actually seen a little bit of that,\u201d he said. The Trump administration \u201cdid back off, but it still has a lot of other ongoing effects.\u201d\nAhead of the award ceremony, Dimon sat down with The Inquirer and the Philadelphia Business Journal at JPMorgan\u2019s branch on Broad and Walnut Streets, which opened a few months ago at the site of a former Wawa.\nIt\u2019s one of dozens of branches the bank has opened in the region since the late 2010s, betting that physical locations can still be profitable even as many customers have turned to online banking.\nDimon discussed Trump\u2019s trade talks, Congress\u2019 tax agenda, cuts to scientific research, and his company\u2019s back-to-office policy. Here are highlights from the interview, which has been edited for length and clarity.\nWhat do you think the Trump administration should prioritize in its trade negotiations with other countries?\nThe goal should be, at the end of the day, take Europe and the U.K. to finish these agreements. If there\u2019s unfair trade, fix it. But the goal should be to help them be strong and help them stay close to us. Keep the Western world, the free and democratic nations \u2014 the EU, the U.K., Australia, Korea, Philippines, Japan \u2014 close and strong.\nThe GOP-led Congress is discussing extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, parts of which are set to expire at the end of the year. What should Congress prioritize in the new tax bill?\nIt [the corporate tax cut] did bring a lot of capital back, a lot of jobs back, a lot more investment here. \u2026 The worst thing to me is to not grow the economy and have any taxes that drive capital and innovation and people overseas. It\u2019s a bad tax strategy. If you want to tax, you should tax incomes, which isn\u2019t going to stop you from growing or expanding. So the first is to maintain it. \u2026 And then maintain what they call the extenders, the R&D tax credits, the investment credits and stuff like that. They have a whole bunch of other stuff on the table. I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen to that.\nInstitutions in Philly like the University of Pennsylvania are concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to scientific research. You\u2019ve said such research is important. Why? And do you think the administration will dial that back?\nIf you look at the history of America, the R&D that took place was in companies and in universities and some of the governments. The government\u2019s got fabulous labs. \u2026 But a lot of it was done \u2026 in universities. \u2026 I think [the cuts are] a mistake, and I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll dial it back. I think they\u2019ve been told by a lot of people that [the cuts] probably can hurt America. That R&D drove a lot of success.\nEarlier this year you required JPMorgan employees on hybrid schedules to return to the office five days a week. Has there been a lot of churn?\nWe\u2019re not here for the employee; we\u2019re here for the customer. And if it hurts younger people, is that fair? And if it hurts the company for innovation and growth and speed, is that right? \u2026\nThere\u2019s been no turnover. People are going back to work. There were complaints about the first day in certain sites \u2014 not enough parking, their cafeteria\u2019s overcrowded. Well, I\u2019m like, OK, get over it. I mean, it\u2019s OK. \u2026\nI completely understand if someone else wants a work-from-home company. They will lose in the marketplace. The other thing is, we have 10% working from home. Always have, permanently. So I\u2019m not against working from home. I\u2019m against working at home when it doesn\u2019t work for the company, the clients. And so we did it by job type. So, no, we\u2019ve had no real pushback, no pushback, no attrition. I think we\u2019re a great place to work."

      "text": "3 of Pa.\u2019s largest employers urge: Fund SEPTA and other mass transit now\nDepriving public transit of needed resources will have economic impacts throughout the commonwealth, write the leaders of Penn, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Comcast.\nAs the leaders of three of Pennsylvania\u2019s largest employers \u2014 the University of Pennsylvania, Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Comcast \u2014 we are compelled to voice our deep concern over funding shortfalls facing mass transit.\nWe have reached a critical crossroads where continued inaction poses significant risks to our employees, the communities we serve, and the broader economy of our commonwealth.\nMore than 4,000 CHOP employees providing critical care to children across the region rely on SEPTA to get to and from work. That\u2019s before considering the thousands of patients that rely on SEPTA to access our services, as we see over 1.4 million outpatient visits and 35,000 inpatient admittances every year.\nThe proposed reductions will impede access to vital healthcare services, particularly for families on fixed incomes. As a major employer and provider for the region, mass transit is a lifeline for our most vulnerable populations.\nSimilarly, the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Medicine depend on SEPTA to facilitate the daily commute of faculty, staff, students, and patients \u2014 all of whom contribute to our commonwealth\u2019s economy, workforce, and well-being. Hundreds of students and more than 12,000 employees utilize mass transit for their daily commutes, in addition to approximately 10,000 low-income patients who receive free SEPTA passes from Penn Medicine to ensure their care.\nService cuts will cause a severe disruption in education, research, and healthcare services that are integral to our institution and the city.\nComcast\u2019s headquarters has approximately 8,500 employees in Center City, with employees coming to the office at least four days a week to foster collaboration and innovation. Reductions in SEPTA service will hinder Comcast\u2019s efforts to maintain a dynamic and productive work environment.\nThe vast majority of employees \u2014 over 75% \u2014 take mass transit to work, especially Regional Rail, making the proposed elimination of four Regional Rail lines a massive threat to the productivity of one of the Philadelphia region\u2019s largest employers and economic drivers.\nWhile we represent institutions primarily based in Southeastern Pennsylvania, our success is integral to the success of Pennsylvania as a whole. Our region is a net contributor to the General Fund. Southeastern Pennsylvania is home to 32% of the state\u2019s population, but we are responsible for 42% of the state\u2019s economic activity.\nDepriving SEPTA and other mass transit agencies of the resources they need to stave off disastrous cuts will undoubtedly lead to negative economic impacts that reverberate throughout the commonwealth.\nGov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s budget proposal includes a historic increase in state funding for mass transit, including SEPTA. This investment is a critical step toward addressing the long-standing structural funding gap that threatens the stability of our transit systems. We commend Shapiro and the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for recognizing that transit is not just a Philadelphia issue \u2014 it is a statewide priority that supports workforce participation, economic growth, and equitable access to opportunity.\nWe also appreciate that Senate leadership has acknowledged the importance of mass transit. Legislative action is now needed to solve this crisis.\nWe urge the governor and General Assembly to come together in supporting increased investment in public transit. Without it, the looming cuts to SEPTA will shock Pennsylvania\u2019s economy \u2014 jeopardizing jobs, mobility, and public safety.\nInvesting in public transportation is investing in the health, education, and prosperity of our communities.\nJ. Larry Jameson is the president of the University of Pennsylvania. Madeline Bell is the CEO of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Brian L. Roberts is the chairman and CEO of Comcast Corp."

      "text": "Comcast will soon require most workers to be in the office 4 days a week\nStarting in the fall, Comcast will be adding one more in-office day to the hybrid work arrangement, affecting roughly 8,000 people who work in the company's Philadelphia buildings.\nAnd then there was one ... remote work day.\nAfter almost a year of working on a hybrid schedule with three days per week in the office, Comcast is planning to expand in-office time to four days per week starting in the fall, according to a company spokesperson.\nThe decision was based on observations from the past year of hybrid work, and a desire to provide more opportunities for collaborative work, in-person meetings, and mentorship, the spokesperson said.\nOffice-based employees have been expected to come in on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays since September. The new policy requires four days in the office, and the specific days will be decided between employees and their managers based on their teams\u2019 needs, the spokesperson said.\nComcast will also allow flexibility for employees and their managers to adjust in-office schedules for individual needs, such as child-care arrangements, and special circumstances, the spokesperson added.\nComcast\u2019s two Center City buildings, at 1701 John F. Kennedy Blvd. and 1800 Arch St., are the primary work location for about 8,000 employees.\nWhen the company rolled out its hybrid work policy last year, leadership had already analyzed roles to determine which ones most needed in-office time, and designated thousands of jobs as virtual home-office positions. Before the pandemic, very few jobs at Comcast had that designation, but now there are more than 25,000 such jobs at the company, said Bill Strahan, Comcast\u2019s executive vice president of human resources, in an interview last month.\nGood news for Center City business\nComcast\u2019s shift back to the office last year was widely seen as a signal to the rest of the local business community that in-office work would be part of the future. Foot traffic in Center City increased immediately.\nIn April, the average number of pedestrians in the Center City business district on a Tuesday was about 40,000 \u2014 roughly 15,000 more than it had been in April 2022 \u2014 according to a recent Center City District report. Foot traffic on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays was also up significantly from 2022, though it was down slightly on Fridays.\nPaul Levy, president and CEO of Center City District, said he sees Comcast\u2019s increase in office days as \u201ca very positive sign\u201d for Center City activity. He expects it will bring more business to retailers and restaurants, and will likely inspire other employers to bring people back into the office more.\n\u201cWhen a major firm like Comcast says they\u2019re coming back, it gives a signal to other firms, even if they don\u2019t do business with Comcast,\u201d Levy said.\nWhile downtown recovery has been steady, it\u2019s not complete. The number of people downtown on an average day in May was 75% of May 2019 levels, and the office vacancy rate is nearly 20% (up from 12% in 2019). The prevalence of remote work has continued to plague the lunch business at Center City restaurants. Ridership on SEPTA Regional Rail is around half of what it was pre-pandemic, while it\u2019s slightly higher for buses and lower for the Broad Street and Market-Frankford Lines.\nComcast has been in touch with SEPTA about the planned increase in in-office days, SEPTA spokesperson Andrew Busch said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled any time we see an indication that more people are going to be on the system,\u201d Busch said. \u201cEvery fare paid helps.\u201d\nSEPTA saw a significant dip in ridership as a result of the pandemic and with federal infrastructure money expiring next year, the transit agency is eager to attract more riders to increase revenue.\nBusch said SEPTA has been in frequent contact with employers large and small in the city as part of their efforts to boost ridership. With three months to prepare for Comcast\u2019s increase in foot traffic, he said, there will be time to discuss potential adjustments to service to meet their needs. Busch noted that SEPTA has already noticed some increase in the number of commuters on Mondays, but that hasn\u2019t created a significant uptick in revenue for the transit system yet.\nMarc Vetri, who opened Pizzeria Salvy in the Comcast Technology Center last month, said he expects another day of in-office presence to make a big difference for his business.\n\u201cAnything to boost vibrancy of the city and keep it humming is a great thing in my book,\u201d Vetri said."

  "argos_summary": "Many Philadelphia employers, including Comcast and Independence Blue Cross, are increasing in-office work requirements, with Comcast mandating four days a week and Independence requiring three. Employees express concerns about the loss of flexibility and the impact on family responsibilities, as well as the potential effects of SEPTA's planned service cuts on commuting. Despite these changes, data indicates that remote work remains stable at around 25%, suggesting a complex landscape for hybrid work policies as companies navigate employee needs and operational demands.",
