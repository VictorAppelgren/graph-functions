  "content": "Baby boomer homeowners are sitting on a ton of equity right now. According to the Federal Reserve, they hold $17.3 trillion in home equity, roughly 50% of the country\u2019s total equity. This is in large part due to so many of them \u2014 83% of homeowners with a fixed-rate mortgage \u2014 having let their property build equity over time.\n\nLearn More: 4 Ways Trump\u2019s \u2018Big Beautiful Bill\u2019 Will Change How You Plan for Retirement\n\nUnfortunately, many boomers are facing a new problem, and that\u2019s the current U.S. housing market. As of quarter two of 2025, the average home sold for over $512,000. According to a 2022 Redfin report, nearly 30% of all \u201clarge homes\u201d (those with at least three bedrooms) belong to empty-nest boomers.\n\nBetween high housing prices and a lack of smaller, more accessible homes to downsize to, many boomers are aging in place. For those who might have wanted to move to a more manageable home or somewhere less expensive altogether \u2014 a common drive for retirees on fixed incomes \u2014 it\u2019s just not feasible.\n\nSo, how can boomers manage this new retirement problem? How can this generation find affordable housing, and what should they consider when making the plunge?\n\nHere are a few things boomers should keep in mind when looking for affordable housing.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that finding affordable housing is a serious problem, and not just for boomers.\n\n\u201cFinding affordable housing is very daunting right now \u2014 many real estate markets are still running hot. While inflation has cooled, prices are still high. Property taxes in many states are increasing and the cost of insurance is also on the rise,\u201d said Christine Coley, certified financial planner and wealth advisor at SteelPeak Wealth.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, of all ages, are seeing drastic increases in the mortgage payment due to increases in property tax and the cost of insurance,\u201d Coley continued. \u201cHomes they could comfortably afford are now moving out of reach with these increased costs. In areas where real estate has surged, people who own their home or are still making payments are having trouble keeping up with the increase to taxes and insurance.\u201d\n\nFor fixed-income boomers who\u2019ve paid off their mortgage, property taxes and insurance are serious financial concerns. The average cost of property taxes is $1,815, while typical homeowners\u2019 insurance runs about $1,754 a year. Larger, more expensive homes tend to have higher taxes and premiums.\n\nFind Out: 4 Retirement Expenses Boomers Didn\u2019t Plan for \u2014 but Should Have\n\nAffordable housing is still out there. It just might be harder to find. Boomers who are considering making the move from their current house to a smaller or more manageable one, or even to a different state, should start by asking themselves a few questions.",

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWarren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in the world, has a reputation for his simple financial wisdom. His advice is certainly worth listening to, especially if it helps you avoid making money mistakes.\nAccording to Buffett, here are 10 things poor people waste money on and what he does instead.\nLow-Value Investments\n\u201cThe most important investment you can make is in yourself,\u201d Buffett has said, according to Inc. \u201cThat\u2019s how knowledge builds up. Like compound interest.\u201d\nOne of Buffett\u2019s most famous tips, known as the Buffett formula, is to go to bed smarter each day.\nAccording to Inc., Buffett recommends reading. He spends about 80% of his day reading, and he suggests that anyone hoping to achieve success should read 500 pages per day.\nIf you\u2019re investing in something other than yourself right now, it might be time to rethink your strategy.\nCredit Card Debt\nBuffett is also very against credit card debt. He prefers to rely on cash instead of using a credit card. \u201cI\u2019ve got an American Express card, which I got in 1964,\u201d Buffett told Yahoo Finance. But I pay cash 98% of the time.\u201d\nQuantity Over Quality\n\u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price,\u201d Buffett wrote in his 1989 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.\nBuffett won\u2019t invest in something just because it\u2019s cheap. Although he\u2019s talking about investing in businesses, this can be applied to everyday life. When you prioritize quantity over quality, the short-term gains may not mean much (and it could cost you more) in the long run.\nUnnecessary Spending\nBuffett doesn\u2019t care about having the latest technology or designer labels. According to AP Moneywise, he used a $20 flip phone for several years before upgrading to an iPhone in 2020.\nHis advice? \u201cDo not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving,\u201d according to Moneywise.\nNew Cars\nCars are depreciating assets. According to Kelley Blue Book, most new vehicles have a 20% drop in value in the first year.\nSo instead of buying a new car, Buffett prefers to buy used vehicles at reduced prices.\n\u201cThe truth is, I only drive about 3,500 miles a year, so I will buy a new car very infrequently,\u201d he said, according to Forbes.\nFull-Price Purchases\nEven Warren Buffett looks for good deals. Years ago, Buffett once treated Bill Gates to a meal at a fast food restaurant and used coupons to help pay for the meal.\n\u201cRemember the laugh we had when we traveled together to Hong Kong and decided to get lunch at McDonald\u2019s? You offered to pay, dug into your pocket, and pulled out \u2026 coupons!\u201d Gates wrote in his and now-ex-wife Melinda\u2019s 2017 annual letter.\n\u201cMelinda just found this photo of me and \u2018the big spender.\u2019 It reminded us how much you value a good deal,\u201d Gates wrote, using the anecdote to segue to a discussion about the value of philanthropy.\nRegular Nights Out\nBuffett has a very simple diet and doesn\u2019t like to go out much. In Buffett\u2019s biography, \u201cThe Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,\u201d author Alice Schroeder quoted him as saying, \u201cI like eating the same thing over and over and over again. I could eat a ham sandwich every day for fifty days in a row for breakfast,\u201d Mashed reported.\nWasted Opportunities\nIn his early years, Buffett picked up side hustles and made money by delivering newspapers, selling used golf balls and buffing cars, as previously reported by GOBankingRates. He also looked for new opportunities, and when he couldn\u2019t find any, he\u2019d create them.\nGambling\nAt a 2007 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, Buffett called gambling \u201csocially revolting,\u201d according to The Motley Fool.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a prude about it, but to quite an extent, gambling is a tax on ignorance,\u201d he reportedly said, referring to the tax revenue generated by gambling.\n\u201cA government shouldn\u2019t make it easy for people to take their Social Security checks and [waste them pulling] a handle.\u201d\nIf you have extra money, don\u2019t waste it on gambling.\nLiving Beyond Their Means\nWhen you\u2019re shopping and see something you like, ask yourself whether you really need it or just want it.\nDuring a 2009 meeting at Emory University, Buffett said something to the effect that his goal is \u201cnot to make people envious.\u201d He also said you can\u2019t buy health or love and warned the audience not to confuse the cost of living with the standard of living, according to meeting notes from a student who attended, which appeared on the student\u2019s Underground Value blog.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s signature legislation, dubbed the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d includes plans for tax cuts, green energy cuts, Medicaid cuts and more. It also contains new retirement account provisions that could affect how Americans plan for their golden years.\nAs the landmark bill makes its way from the House to the Senate, here\u2019s a look at what you need to understand about how it can affect how you plan for retirement.\nTax Cuts Could Make Saving for Retirement Easier\nMany Americans would receive a break on their taxes owed if the bill is passed. This means they would be able to channel more money into retirement savings accounts.\n\u201cRetirement planning fundamentally comes down to having sufficient resources to make work optional,\u201d said Brett Horowitz, principal and wealth manager at Evensky & Katz / Foldes Financial Wealth Management. \u201cThe proposed extensions of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act provisions, combined with new deductions for tip income, overtime pay and seniors over 65, could significantly improve retirement outcomes for Americans.\u201d\nThose who benefited from the cuts in the original Tax Cuts & Jobs Act will continue to enjoy these cuts, allowing them to continue saving for retirement as they had been.\n\u201cWith many TCJA provisions set to expire at the end of 2025, the House Republican proposal to make these extensions permanent may provide the certainty we need for effective long-term planning,\u201d Horowitz said.\n\u201cRetirement modeling depends on clear inputs and stable variables,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe less uncertainty in tax policy, the more accurately we can project success rates. When these changes take effect \u2014 pending Senate approval \u2014 we\u2019ll be able to deliver much better news to clients about their retirement timeline.\u201d\nHorowitz believes if Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d does not ultimately pass, it could negatively affect Americans\u2019 abilities to save for retirement.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a profound psychological difference between telling someone they can retire earlier than expected versus having to extend their working years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe former energizes people about their financial future; the latter can feel overwhelming. These tax provisions create the conditions where more Americans can realistically achieve comfortable retirement.\u201d\nIt Could Affect Long-Term Investment Strategies\nSavvy long-term investment strategies should take taxes into account, so changes to tax laws can shift these strategies.\n\u201cSmart investing isn\u2019t actually about chasing the highest gross returns \u2014 it\u2019s about maximizing what clients actually keep after taxes and expenses, and this tax bill addresses some issues there,\u201d Horowitz said. \u201cWhile we can control costs through low-fee funds, tax efficiency requires a more nuanced approach that varies by everyone\u2019s personal circumstances.\n\u201cHigher tax rates push us toward tax-free municipal bonds and tax-efficient ETFs in taxable accounts, while we place tax-inefficient investments in retirement accounts,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis \u2018tax location\u2019 strategy can significantly impact net returns, even if it means accounts perform differently.\u201d\nChanges to the SALT Deduction Can Provide More Freedom When It Comes to Where You Plan To Retire\n\u201cTwo provisions in the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act have created the most anxiety for our clients \u2014 the SALT deduction cap and estate tax exemptions,\u201d Horowitz said. \u201cBoth are getting significant relief under the current proposal.\u201d\nThe proposed increase in the SALT deduction cap means retirees will face less of a penalty if they choose to spend their golden years in a state with higher income taxes.\n\u201cThe SALT deduction increase from $10,000 to $40,000 will reshape where people choose to live and retire,\u201d Horowitz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen migration patterns shift dramatically since 2017, with high-tax states losing residents to states like Florida and Texas. This change reduces the penalty for living in high-income-tax states, though it doesn\u2019t eliminate the advantage of no-tax states entirely.\u201d\nA Higher Estate Tax Exemption Will Bring Relief to Wealthy Americans\nEstate planning strategies would also change for many Americans if the bill were to pass.\n\u201cOn the estate side, the current $13.99 million exemption was set to drop to $7.14 million in 2026 \u2014 a reduction that had wealthy clients scrambling to implement complex gifting strategies and trust structures,\u201d Horowitz said. \u201cThe proposed permanent increase to $15 million per person, or $30 million for couples, provides enormous relief for families in that middle tier.\u201d\nThis is particularly important because of state-level complications, Horowitz continued.\n\u201cTake New York, where you could face no federal estate tax, but still owe state estate taxes on estates between $7.16 million and $13.99 million,\u201d he said. \u201cThe interplay between federal and state rules makes domicile planning critical.\u201d\nThe \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d should make estate planning less complex for many people.\n\u201cFor clients who\u2019ve already implemented sophisticated estate planning strategies, those structures remain valuable,\u201d Horowitz said. \u201cBut for families with estates under the new thresholds, this eliminates the pressure to make rushed gifting decisions or create complex trusts simply to avoid tax cliffs.\u201d\nOverall, Horowitz believes the bill will make retirement planning easier.\n\u201cThe permanent nature of these changes \u2014 assuming they pass \u2014 finally gives families the certainty to make long-term decisions about where to live, how to structure their wealth and when to implement estate planning strategies,\u201d he said.\nEditor\u2019s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nPresident-elect Trump\u2019s previous term and statements leading up to his next presidency suggest that interest rates may get lower. For example, any waste that the Department of Government Efficiency can trim could help to keep rates low. Furthermore, tariffs could increase the cost of building a new home, thus increasing housing prices.\nReal estate investors can use this opportunity to accumulate more properties. However, boomers who are looking for affordable options can also find promising housing markets on this list. These are some of the markets boomers should consider.\nMurfreesboro, Tennessee\nJoe Hafner is the owner and founder of Hafner Real Estate. He specializes in middle Tennessee real estate and has been involved in more than 1,000 real estate transactions. He recommended two housing markets that are just outside of Nashville. His first recommendation is Murfreesboro, which is one of the fastest-growing cities in the U.S.\n\u201cWith people from all over the country still moving to Murfreesboro in large numbers, residential real estate remains an investment as solid as they come,\u201d Hafner said.\nAverage home values in Murfreesboro are up 2% compared to last year and about 50% higher than five years ago.\n\u201cThis makes buy-and-hold price appreciation the focal point for most investors,\u201d Hafner explained. \u201cHowever, with a median sales price under $500,000, many investors are also able to find a rental property with decent cash flow.\u201d\nMount Juliet, Tennessee\nHafner also suggested Mount Juliet as a promising housing market for boomers, whether they\u2019re real estate investors or just want to relocate.\n\u201cMount Juliet, located east of Nashville in Wilson County, has become a hotspot for folks moving to Middle Tennessee who don\u2019t want to live in Nashville and Davidson County,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past five years, Mount Juliet home values have risen close to 55%.\u201d\nHe said most of Middle Tennessee, including Mount Juliet, is best for \u201cbuying and holding\u201d \u2014 meaning purchasing a house either to live in or as a long-term investment.\n\u201cMount Juliet\u2019s housing market has shown its resilience in the past,\u201d he added. \u201cDuring the Great Recession, Mount Juliet more than held its own in sales volume and property value compared to other Middle Tennessee communities.\u201d\nLouisville, Kentucky\nBoomers can find several midwestern cities that offer reasonable housing prices and plenty of things to do. Louisville fits the bill with the Kentucky Derby, Kentucky Exposition Center and plenty of outdoor activities. Louisville\u2019s metro population increased by 0.9% in 2024.\nYou don\u2019t have to be a real estate investor to make a lot of money in this city. Some homeowners rent their places during the Kentucky Derby and make well over $1,000 per day.

Based on current trends and economic forecasts, we can make some educated predictions about the direction mortgage rates might take in the coming year.\nEconomic Recovery and Inflation\nOne of the critical factors influencing mortgage rates is the overall health of the economy. If the economic recovery from the recent turbulent years continues, we could see a gradual increase in consumer spending and investment. This, in turn, might lead to a moderate rise in inflation, which often prompts higher interest rates. However, if inflation is kept in check and remains within target ranges set by central banks, any increase in mortgage rates could be modest.\nFederal Reserve Policies\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy greatly influences mortgage rates. If the Fed continues to raise its benchmark interest rate to curb inflation, mortgage rates are likely to follow suit. However, if the Fed decides to lower rates to stimulate economic growth, mortgage rates could decrease or stabilize at lower levels.\nGlobal Market Influences\nGlobal economic conditions, including international trade relations, political stability, and foreign investment patterns, also impact U.S. mortgage rates. If global markets remain stable, this could lead to a more predictable mortgage rate environment in the U.S. However, unexpected global economic challenges could result in either an increase or decrease in rates, depending on the nature of the issue.\nReal Estate Market Dynamics\nThe state of the real estate market itself is a significant factor. If the supply of homes increases, meeting the pent-up demand, this could lead to more stable or slightly lower mortgage rates. However, if the housing market remains tight with high demand and low supply, mortgage rates might remain elevated to reflect the competitive buying environment.\nTechnological Advancements and Lending Practices\nAdvancements in financial technology and changes in lending practices could also impact mortgage rates. More efficient lending processes and increased competition among lenders could lead to more favorable rates for borrowers.\nPredicted Range for 2025\nConsidering these factors, a conservative prediction for 30-year fixed mortgage rates by 2025 could be in the range of 5.5% to 7%. This estimate accounts for potential economic growth, the Federal Reserve\u2019s likely monetary policy responses, global market influences, and real estate market conditions.\nConclusion\nWhile predicting future mortgage rates is not an exact science, understanding the interplay of various economic factors can provide a reasonable forecast. Potential homebuyers and investors should continue to monitor economic trends and consult with financial advisors to make informed decisions in the ever-changing landscape of mortgage rates.\nEditor's note: This article was produced via automated technology and then fine-tuned and verified for accuracy by a member of GOBankingRates' editorial team.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

      "text": "4 Retirement Expenses Many Boomers Didn\u2019t Plan For (But Should Have)\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nThere are a few critical expenses that are often inevitable in retirement, and it\u2019s likely that many boomers didn\u2019t plan for them accordingly. These expenses are now coming back to bite them.\nWhat are they, and how can succeeding generations avoid these often innocent mistakes?\nLong-Term Care Planning\nPatrice Williams-Lindo, CEO of Career Nomad, saw just how painfully pricey long-term care for seniors can be while helping both her parents and in-laws navigate aging, illness and end-of-life care.\n\u201cI can tell you firsthand: the costs boomers didn\u2019t plan for aren\u2019t just financial \u2014 they\u2019re emotional, generational and systemic,\u201d Williams-Lindo said. \u201cMy family was quoted over $6,000/month for quality assisted living in Georgia. Multiply that over a few years and you\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 money most didn\u2019t save because they assumed retirement meant rest; not round-the-clock care.\u201d\nMany financial experts, including Jay Zigmont, PhD, MBA, CFP, founder and CEO of Childfree Wealth, agreed with Williams-Lindo that lack of long-term care planning among boomers \u2014 and younger generations \u2014 is among the worst and costliest mistakes.\n\u201cA year in a skilled nursing facility runs $115k, on average. Men will spend 2.2 years in care, and women 3.7,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cWithout a plan to pay for long-term care, the first person that needs care may cause their spouse to go broke.\u201d\nLong-term care, whether you pay out of pocket or with a long-term care insurance policy, is incredibly expensive, so it makes sense that so many boomers didn\u2019t bother.\n\u201cFor a couple that wants to pay out of pocket, I recommend setting aside $500k now,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cIf you are single, you also need to set aside $500k. That may not make sense on the surface, but with a couple, your spouse often provides care for some time, making the total cost lower.\u201d\nInflation\nA common unplanned for expense that Frederick Saide, managing partner at MoneyMattersUSA, Advisory LLC often sees coming back to haunt boomers is inflation.\n\u201cI often get the response, \u2018That\u2019s not my problem,'\u201d Saide told GOBankingRates. \u201cThe assumption is retirement will not last all that long \u2014 certainly not 30 or more years \u2014 so \u2018I won\u2019t have to go through the inflation cycle three or four times\u2019 is the mindset.\u201d\nTo guide clients, Saide uses the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of Actuaries calculator on longevity to help establish both individual and joint life expectancies.\n\u201cWhat I want is an agreement on the time horizon to plan for; otherwise, we won\u2019t have a clear direction on how much money is needed to last, and what the client wants their money to achieve for them,\u201d Saide. \u201cThis process is the reality check moment when I show from 2002 to 2023 inflation averaged 5.5%, nearly double the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\u201d\nSocial Security and Pension Tax Burdens\nMany boomers made the mistake of not looking too deeply into the fine print of Social Security and required minimum distributions (RMDs). Specifically, they didn\u2019t study the tax aspect.\n\u201cUp to 85% of Social Security benefits can be taxed, and RMDs can nudge retirees into higher tax brackets, triggering Medicare surcharges,\u201d said Andrew Latham, CFP, content director at Supermoney.com. \u201cRoth conversions in your 60s can help, but many wait too long.\u201d\nEstate Plan Updates\nDid you make a will in your 40s and not update it to reflect your needs and wants in your 60s? A lot of boomers make that mistake.\n\u201cMany times, people adopt a \u2018set it and forget it\u2019 mentality when it comes to estate planning,\u201d said Charles Nemes, co-founder and CEO at Nemes Rush Family Wealth Management. \u201cThis can lead to significant damage to the relationships beneficiaries enjoy today, and potentially put money into their hands when it could actually hurt them more than help them. Unfortunately, estate plans seldom reflect the current feelings of those who drafted them years ago because so many things could have changed. For example, a beneficiary may have issues with drugs/gambling/alcohol, or is getting divorced, has a child with special needs, is getting sued, or is in a high-risk profession.\u201d\nNemes recommended reviewing your estate plan at least every five years to be sure it clearly reflects your current knowledge and feelings about each beneficiary.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

  "argos_summary": "Baby boomer homeowners currently hold $17.3 trillion in home equity, but many are struggling to downsize due to high housing prices and a lack of affordable options. As of mid-2025, the average home price exceeds $512,000, making it difficult for retirees on fixed incomes to find manageable housing. Experts suggest that boomers should consider various factors when searching for affordable housing, including rising property taxes and insurance costs, which are impacting their financial stability.",
