  "title": "After secret meetings, MARTA names new interim CEO",
  "description": "MARTA\u2019s ad hoc CEO search committee met four times without public notice since July 17.",
  "content": "The discussions in those meetings led to Hunt\u2019s selection and to the appointment of an \u201coperations committee\u201d that will advise him on his executive decisions.\n\nThe committee, which will meet with Hunt weekly, is made up of Peter Aman from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens office; Katie Kirkpatrick, head of the Atlanta Metro Chamber of Commerce; Anna Roach, executive director of the Atlanta Regional Commission; and Keith Parker, MARTA\u2019s former chief and the current CEO of Goodwill of North Georgia.\n\nParker is the only person on the committee with transportation expertise.\n\nThere could be as many as three additional members appointed.\n\nHunt declined to speak with reporters after his appointment, but during the meeting thanked the board for their trust in him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m accepting this role A) with a humble heart, B) knowing everything we need to do to move forward,\u201d he said, adding that with everyone\u2019s help, \u201cI know we\u2019re going to build an even better MARTA going forward.\u201d\n\nThe secret board discussions were apparently contentious at times, with MARTA board member Valencia Williamson from Clayton County saying during public comment the decisions around appointing an interim have \u201cnot been easy\u201d and divided the board at times.\n\nThose disagreements seemingly delayed the naming of an interim; Chair Jennifer Ide said the goal had been to pick someone July 24.\n\nThe search committee was supposed to gather that day, apparently, but the meeting was canceled in lieu of a full board meeting, which had been advertised. When asked why the search committee meetings had not been advertised, MARTA spokeswoman Stephany Fisher said it was a mistake and that future meetings would be.\n\nFisher said she didn\u2019t know about the four other ad hoc meetings until Thursday.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when they were held. The acknowledgment they happened at all came in the resolution approved by the board naming Hunt, which Ide read aloud before the board voted. In an interview after the meeting, Ide walked that back.\n\n\u201cI should say, we had four rounds of discussions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe never had an in-person meeting. It was phone calls of different members of the committee deciding where we should go next.\u201d\n\nRichard T. Griffiths, a former CNN executive and Georgia First Amendment Foundation board member, said the four meetings should have been public and disclosed as such.\n\nHe said the state\u2019s open meetings act is clear. \u201cIf they had four meetings, those all should have been public meetings.\u201d\n\nIde said the debate was over who to appoint and whether to go with an internal or external candidate. That led to the decision to appoint both an internal candidate and an external advising board.\n\n\u201cThis was the best solution we could come up with for not losing speed and momentum but bringing fresh thought and play,\u201d Ide said.\n\nOne of the external candidates the board was interested in was Parker, she said, but \u201cGoodwill wasn\u2019t willing to do without Keith.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the way that I am able to get Keith\u2019s input, is by having him serve on the strategic committee,\u201d Ide said.\n\nThe committee interviewed three internal candidates, she said.\n\nIn addition to Hunt, they interviewed Chief Financial Officer Kevin Hurley and Rhonda Allen, who has served as chief in an acting capacity since June. Ide said they didn\u2019t interview external candidates but that she talked with \u201cfour or five\u201d possibilities herself.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what the advisory board\u2019s role will be, or how it is different from the MARTA board, which is itself tasked with overseeing the chief. The resolution appointing the advisers said they are to work with Hunt \u201con a weekly basis\u201d and with the MARTA board monthly.\n\nThe announcement of the advisory committee won praise Thursday from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, who said in a statement he was encouraged the board turned to executives \u201cwho are deeply committed to the success of metro Atlanta and have experience leading transformational change efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cMARTA is a critical ingredient to our success, and the Atlanta region is counting on them to build the world-class system that residents deserve,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nKirkpatrick, from the metro chamber, was the only one of the four appointees to respond to a request for comment. She congratulated Hunt and said she is looking forward to working with him.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment that calls for bold, visible leadership,\u201d Kirkpatrick said.\n\nMARTA has been besieged with problems in recent months. Since Greenwood\u2019s resignation, Ide has said twice the board recognizes the urgency needed to \u201cturn the ship around.\u201d She said Thursday she\u2019s aware business and civic groups are frustrated with the board itself, and members could be more transparent.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk about bad news as much as we talk about good news,\u201d Ide said. \u201cThat\u2019s hard as a leader, I think, to acknowledge when things aren\u2019t going smoothly.\u201d\n\nHunt and the advisory board will oversee MARTA and its $1.55 billion budget during a pivotal time for the agency. It is in the process of launching a bus network redesign, new rail cars and new fare gates, all of which are expected to roll out in the next year. There is also a major renovation at Five Points station and construction for the system\u2019s first rapid bus line that are underway \u2014 and behind schedule.\n\nThere is additional pressure to ensure MARTA is ready for the World Cup next summer. Greenwood previously told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s editorial board the agency was \u201cmore than ready,\u201d but several recent smaller events have had snags, most recently when an escalator malfunctioned after a Beyonc\u00e9 concert.\n\nBefore his early retirement, Greenwood had led the agency as chief for almost three years and as deputy for two years before that. It\u2019s unlikely the next chief executive and general manager will come from within, Ide said. Neither Hunt nor Allen are interested, she added.\n\nIde said the past month has shown the need to build MARTA\u2019s internal capacity.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure \u2026 that we are planning for successions and transitions,\u201d she said. \u201cThree to five years from now I would love to see a much deeper bench here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible the next chief won\u2019t come from the transit industry, an idea pushed by Atlanta\u2019s business and civic community.\n\nThe board has selected Diversified Global to conduct a national search. Ide said the board opted against using search firms MARTA has used in the past and went with Diversified Global because they have experience running searches beyond the transportation industry.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to limit ourselves to perhaps the same pool of candidates that that might sort of naturally come to mind,\u201d she said.\n\nIde said she was in favor of public meetings to solicit feedback on what the board should look for in its next chief.\n\nIdeally, she said, a permanent leader would be in place before next summer\u2019s FIFA World Cup games.",

      "text": "MARTA is set to start working on the Five Points Station renovation in May after 10 months of delays, officials said Thursday afternoon.\nThe announcement comes after months of disagreements between MARTA and the city of Atlanta over how to proceed with the project to transform the transit agency\u2019s central station.\nIn February, MARTA said the city intentionally stalled approval of the demolition permits needed to begin work. Public records obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution appear to show that city officials, at the direction of Mayor Andre Dickens, tied permit approval to the completion of an audit into MARTA spending.\nDickens denied holding up permits and said the city wanted the work to start.\n\u201cAnyone that told you we were holding or delaying permits was lying to you,\u201d Dickens said last month.\nDemolition permits were approved after an AJC story about the delays published in mid-March. City staff said their approval of the permits while the audit issue was still pending proves the two issues weren\u2019t tied together.\nOther permits related to the project are still pending but are expected to be complete soon, spokesperson Stephany Fisher said.\n\u201cWe are in active discussions with the city to finalize the remaining permits,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cOur goal is to get construction started and avoid additional costs with delay.\u201d\nThe $230 million renovation will consist of removing the existing concrete canopy and replacing it with a translucent roof, as well as adding street-level bus bays. It\u2019s being paid for primarily with proceeds from the halfpenny sales tax Atlanta voters approved for transit expansion projects in 2016.\nMARTA is at risk of incurring fines of up to $10,000 per day for each day past last July\u2019s planned start.\nWork is set to begin May 17, Fisher said. The whole project will take four years to complete.\nThe station will remain open to trains and pedestrians during construction, though the work will impact some routes.\nStation services at Five Points, like the police precinct, lost and found and reduced fare offices, will be relocated, with details to be announced soon, MARTA said.\nThe station soccer field, the community garden, information booth and federal building tunnel will close during construction.\nRestrooms will also close. Passengers can use restrooms at the nearby GWCC/CNN Center, Peachtree Center, Georgia State and West End stations.\nBus service changes\nStops on eight bus routes will be relocated to Forsyth Street: 3, 21, 40, 49, 55, 107, 186 and 813.\nThree routes will be detoured through downtown and will no longer stop at Five Points: 26, 42 and 816.\nSix routes that previously terminated at Five Points will terminate at Georgia State Station: 21, 42, 49, 55, 107 and 186.\nThree other routes will now terminate at King Memorial Station: 26, 813 and 899.\nOne route, 816, will now terminate at Civic Center Station.\nCobbLinc, Ride Gwinnett and Xpress commuter buses will operate as scheduled.\nAdditional bus rider impacts are expected and will be announced at a later date.\nKeep Reading\nThe Latest\nFeatured"

      "text": "As General Manager and CEO Collie Greenwood waved from the cockpit, train car number 1004 made its inaugural ride into MARTA\u2019s Lindbergh Station to a noisy backdrop of train honks, cheers and Metallica\u2019s \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d blasting from speakers.\nOnlookers crowded the platform with phones lifted to capture the exact moment when the transit agency\u2019s new CQ400 railcars came into sight. It\u2019s the first design change to MARTA\u2019s trains since they began rolling almost half a century ago.\n\u201cYour chariot has arrived at last,\u201d Greenwood told those gathered before encouraging them to explore the aluminum-frame train still sporting that \u201cnew car\u201d smell.\nCredit: Miguel Martinez/AJC\nCredit: Miguel Martinez/AJC\nThe flashy demonstration \u2014 average riders must wait until the end of the year before the new trains are actually in service \u2014 was the main attraction at Thursday\u2019s State of MARTA address, which was hosted in partnership with the Council for Quality Growth.\nGreenwood painted a rosy picture of a transit agency that has struggled with service reliability, low ridership, and safety, focusing instead on MARTA\u2019s wins: triple-A bond ratings, station renovations and an investment in a new train control system.\n\u201cThe state of MARTA is strong,\u201d he said.\nAll of MARTA\u2019s existing trains will eventually be replaced by 224 new railcars built by Stadler, a Swiss rail construction company with its U.S. headquarters in Utah. The train cars were built in Hungary and work is being completed at Stadler\u2019s Salt Lake City plant.\nThe new trains are four cars long, all connected by an open gangway that lets riders walk from one end to the other. It\u2019s a design popular in Europe and Asia but newer to the U.S., where it was first introduced by New York City\u2019s transit system last year.\nThe front of the cars features a lighted \u201csmile\u201d that will correspond with the rail line being served, either Red, Gold, Green or Blue. The overall look is like a scene from a sci-fi movie, and display boards on the trains proclaimed \u201cThe Future is Here.\u201d\nInside, there are 100 digital display screens with route information. Cameras and noise monitors will alert operators and law enforcement to disruptions on the train that might require intervention.\nThe trains will be outfitted with a new train control system designed by Stadler and approved by MARTA\u2019s Board of Directors in December for $500 million. The railcars, purchased in 2019, cost $700 million total, MARTA spokeswoman Stephany Fisher said.\nThe new trains require less electricity to operate and are designed with the latest safety standards in the event of a crash, said Martin Ridder, Stadler\u2019s U.S. CEO. They also feature redundant systems to minimize service disruptions.\nRidder said there\u2019s no other train car like it in North America.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got that feel and look that makes you want to take the train,\u201d Ridder told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\nCredit: Miguel Martinez-Jimenez\nCredit: Miguel Martinez-Jimenez\nMARTA Board Chairperson Jennifer Ide said she thinks the new train cars are \u201ctransformational\u201d and will give metro Atlantans a visual reminder of the changes happening at MARTA and reassure them that progress is being made.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see all of these initiatives that have been worked on behind the scenes for a number of years come together and come to life,\u201d Ide said in an interview.\nIde said she thinks the new trains will help draw in riders, along with efforts to allow tap-to-pay instead of fare cards and WiFi throughout the system. But she said MARTA also has to address reliability so that the system is competitive with other options.\nIde said she\u2019d planned to take a bus to MARTA\u2019s headquarters a day earlier but after waiting, she learned the route was canceled. On Thursday, she had her husband drop her off because it would have taken her nearly an hour by transit.\n\u201cEven I\u2019m not going to choose to ride 54 minutes when it\u2019s a seven-minute drive,\u201d Ide said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out other ways.\u201d\nGreenwood said in an interview that the new cars demonstrate how much MARTA cares about the quality of the ride. He said it was exhilarating to show off the new trains.\n\u201cThis train is such a visceral representation of what we mean to provide to the city of Atlanta and to metropolitan Atlanta that I think it\u2019s going to do wonders for ridership,\u201d Greenwood said. \u201cI think people are going to start there and then start to figure out, well, what else can MARTA do for us if they\u2019re putting this much care and concern and technology into the rail system?\u201d\nCredit: Miguel Martinez-Jimenez\nCredit: Miguel Martinez-Jimenez\nMARTA has struggled more than almost every other major transit agency in the country to recover bus and train ridership that fell during the pandemic, according to a recent Federal Transit Administration report. Ridership in 15 cities has surpassed prepandemic levels but not in Atlanta, where recovery is below average and ranked second-to-last compared to other metros.\nGreenwood said it\u2019s a challenge because of high work-from-home rates in Atlanta.\nWhile ridership hasn\u2019t fully returned, Greenwood said the annual increases are a hopeful sign of progress. He said he hoped new residents moving to the metro will opt for transit even if former riders have developed new habits.\n\u201cBus and rail are going to take some time,\u201d he said.\nThe upcoming bus network redesign should also help with ridership, Greenwood said.\nMARTA is in the process of getting feedback on the first major overall of the bus network in the transit agency\u2019s history. The plans call for more frequent routes in some areas and will remove routes in others in exchange for on-demand rideshares. The total number of routes would drop from 113 to 79.\nThe new bus service changes are expected to go into effect by the end of 2025.\nAbout the Author\nKeep Reading\nThe Latest\nFeatured"
