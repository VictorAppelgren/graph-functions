  "title": "Daniil Medvedev eliminated in first round of U.S. Open after on-court incident",
  "description": "Daniil Medvedev's match was delayed after a photographer entered the court, leading to a tense exchange between the former U.S. Open winner and chair umpire.",
  "content": "Daniil Medvedev reacts during his first-round loss to Benjamin Bonzi at the U.S. Open on Sunday night.\n\nDaniil Medvedev\u2019s match was delayed more than six minutes between points Sunday night, after a photographer entered the court on match point and the 2021 U.S. Open champion became enraged by the chair umpire\u2019s decision to award his opponent a first serve.\n\nThe latest Medvedev meltdown on Louis Armstrong Stadium led to a wild change in the match. The No. 13 seed was a point away from being eliminated, then won the next two sets to force a deciding fifth before Benjamin Bonzi eliminated him from a second straight major with a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 0-6, 6-4 victory that ended early Monday.\n\n\u201cI tried to stay calm in the match but it was not easy,\u201d Bonzi said.\n\nBonzi had just hit his first serve leading 5-4 in the third set. After he missed it, a photographer left his position before the Frenchman could hit his second.\n\nChair umpire Greg Allensworth told the photographer to get off the court, then announced that Bonzi would get another first serve because of the delay \u2014 which is common in tennis. Medvedev then approached the chair to complain about the decision.\n\n\u201cHe wants to go home, guys. He doesn\u2019t like to be here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour,\u201d Medvedev shouted into the microphones behind the chair.\n\nMedvedev kept encouraging the loud boos on Armstrong, which eventually lasted so long that he then tried to get fans to quiet down so Bonzi could serve. When Bonzi finally did, he double-faulted, and Medvedev won the game and later the set in a tiebreaker to prolong the match.\n\n\u201cI never experienced something like that,\u201d said Bonzi, who had fans chanting his name at times.\n\nIt was reminiscent of Medvedev\u2019s 2019 match on the same court, when fans booed him for his antics and he later taunted the crowd in his post-match interview, saying the jeers gave him energy. Medvedev had snatched the towel from a ballperson during the match and was given a code violation by umpire Damien Dumusois. Medvedev then threw his racket in the direction of Dumusois, barked something at him and later flashed his middle finger next to his forehead as he walked past the umpire\u2019s chair, actions that led to him being fined $9,000 for that match.\n\nMedvedev reached the final that year, then won the title two years later. But he went just 1-4 in Grand Slam tournaments this year and was also upset by Bonzi in the first round at Wimbledon.\n\nMedvedev sat in his chair for a few minutes after the match and repeatedly smashed his racket before eventually departing.\n\nA U.S. Tennis Association spokesman said the photographer was escorted from the court by U.S. Open security and his credential was revoked.",

      "text": "Graphic Testimony in Bryant Hearing\n- Share via\nEAGLE, Colo. \u2014 A sheriff\u2019s detective testified Thursday that the 19-year-old resort worker accusing Kobe Bryant of rape told police that the Laker star placed his arms around her neck and forced her to have sex, despite her protests and tears.\nBut the woman also told investigators she went willingly to Bryant\u2019s room late at night, sneaking through the hotel kitchen to get there. And testimony indicated that there were no bruises or marks on the woman\u2019s neck or shoulders a day after the encounter.\nEagle County Sheriff\u2019s Det. Doug Winters, questioned during a preliminary hearing, testified that the woman said Bryant repeatedly asked her not to tell anyone and made her promise not to before letting her leave his room June 30 at an Edwards, Colo., resort.\nThe hearing, which included riveting testimony from Winters and contentious questioning from Bryant attorney Pamela Mackey, lasted more than five hours and ended without a decision on whether Bryant will stand trial on a felony sexual assault charge.\nEagle County Judge Frederick Gannett ordered the hearing continued on Wednesday. Bryant, 25, remains free on $25,000 bail. He has denied raping the woman, saying that they had consensual sex.\nBryant\u2019s accuser was not in court, leaving Winters to give, in explicit detail, the first public account of the woman\u2019s story. The detective was aggressively challenged by Mackey, who was warned by the judge for using the accuser\u2019s name in open court.\nThe hearing was covered by some 300 reporters and camera crews, most of whom were forced to stay outside because the proceeding took place in a small courtroom and was closed to cameras and recording devices.\nMany experts were surprised there was any testimony at all, anticipating the defense would waive its right to a hearing and let Bryant plead not guilty at an arraignment. The Laker guard, a five-time NBA All-Star, flew in for the hearing from Hawaii, where the Lakers had ended training camp. He arrived 90 minutes before the hearing with his attorneys, bodyguards and agent. He remained expressionless throughout the proceeding, his eyes locked on Winters, the day\u2019s only witness.\nWinters testified that the woman told him the encounter began with mutual flirting during a tour of the resort and ended with forced vaginal intercourse while she leaned over a chair. Bryant held her neck throughout the five-minute assault, the woman told Winters.\nShe told Winters that she broke into tears after twice telling Bryant \u201cin a normal tone\u201d to stop, then became more forceful, grabbing his hands and prying them from her neck. Afterward, the woman cleaned up in the bathroom, promised Bryant not to tell anyone what happened, then ran downstairs to the lobby, meeting a bellman who had seen the pair during the tour of the hotel, the woman told Winters. The bellman, Bobby Pietrack, became the first person to hear the woman\u2019s story.\nThe woman drove home and made her allegations to police the next day. Winters interviewed her for a short time at her parents\u2019 Eagle home and later for about an hour at the Eagle County sheriff\u2019s office.\nUnder cross-examination from Bryant attorney Mackey, Winters said he saw no bruises on the woman during the interviews. He also said the woman told a nurse at a Glenwood Springs hospital that evening that Bryant had insisted she kiss his penis before allowing her to leave his hotel room -- something the woman did not tell Winters.\nWinters also said DNA tests showed that the woman\u2019s blood was found on the inside of Bryant\u2019s T-shirt. The detective said she had told him she bled from the assault.\nMackey aggressively challenged Winters\u2019 testimony and the physical evidence, which consisted of three photographs presented by Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Crittenden. One photograph showed a small bruise on the accuser\u2019s left jaw; the others were of what the prosecution said were vaginal injuries from the assault.\nMackey suggested that small scrapes, visible only on a magnified, dye-enhanced photograph, were caused by a speculum during an examination of the woman\u2019s genital area by hospital staff.\nA short time later, Mackey brought the proceeding to a halt when she asked Winters whether the woman\u2019s injuries might also be \u201cconsistent with a person who has had sex with three different men in three days.\u201d\nThe judge called for a recess, emptying the courtroom and telling attorneys from both sides to meet him in his chambers. Mackey was scolded earlier by Gannett when she used the accuser\u2019s name six times during her cross-examination.\nShe told the judge she would write herself \u201ca big note\u201d not to use the name again. Countered Gannett: \u201cOr I could get you a big muzzle.\u201d\nMackey continued to press the detective, particularly about the absence of bruises anywhere on the woman\u2019s body. Winters said he did not even see the bruise on her jaw during his interview with her.\n\u201cShe talks [about] how Mr. Kobe Bryant grabbed her neck and choked her,\u201d Mackey asked Winters. \u201cYou looked at her neck to see?\u201d\nAfter Winters said he had indeed examined the woman for injuries, Mackey asked if he could see the bruises.\n\u201cNot from the front, no,\u201d Winters said.\n\u201cNot a red mark?\u201d Mackey asked.\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNot a scratch?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d he said.\nMost legal experts had predicted that the defense would waive the hearing and go directly to trial, speculating that lurid testimony in open court would be damaging to Bryant.\nBut Mackey sought to turn the hearing to Bryant\u2019s advantage by challenging Winters at every turn. Observers thought she succeeded.\n\u201cSo far, the prosecution case is weaker than expected,\u201d said Craig Silverman, a former Denver deputy district attorney who sat in the courtroom.\nCrittenden conducted the direct examination of the detective, which surprised some legal analysts because the attorney had suffered a seizure in court during a murder trial 48 days ago. A spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office had said at the time that Crittenden was not expected to play a key role in the Bryant case.\nHowever, Mark Hurlbert, the district attorney who brought the charge against Bryant, and Ingrid Bakke, a deputy district attorney and sexual assault specialist on loan from Boulder County, let Crittenden do all the talking.\nMackey made repeated objections to what she said were Crittenden\u2019s leading questions, and Gannett sustained most of them, at one point telling the prosecutor sarcastically, \u201cWe took different evidence classes.\u201d\nThe cross-examination will continue Wednesday, and Gannett hinted that he might close the remainder of the hearing. The judge denied two attempts Thursday by Bryant\u2019s attorneys to have the hearing closed, once before it began and again during a break.\nHowever, Gannett cleared the courtroom during testimony from Winters about an interview authorities conducted with Bryant the day after the incident; the defense argued that Bryant\u2019s statements could be inadmissible. It is unclear whether Bryant was in custody at the time of the interview and whether he was read his Miranda rights.\nBryant, who had been in Hawaii at training camp, arrived at the Eagle County Justice Center in a white SUV, part of a three-vehicle convoy. Wearing a dark blazer and mustard-colored polo shirt without a tie, he walked inside through a metal detector.\nConcealed were Bryant\u2019s new tattoos, one on his biceps of a crown and butterfly wings over his wife\u2019s name and another on his right wrist of his toddler daughter, Natalia.\nThe Lakers have stood by Bryant, who had arrived a day late to the team\u2019s Hawaii training camp because of an undisclosed illness. He practiced with teammates for several days but did not play in the Lakers\u2019 first two exhibition games.\nThere was no word about when he would rejoin the team, although he vowed last week to play this season. He also said last weekend that he was \u201cterrified\u201d about the prospects of the case moving forward.\nBryant was in Eagle County last June for knee surgery, which was performed the morning after the sexual encounter.\nWinters said Bryant arrived at the hotel with two bodyguards and met the woman while she was checking them in. She showed them to his room on the first floor, and Bryant pulled her aside and asked her to come back later to give him a tour.\n\u201cIt was more of a secretive thing,\u201d Winters said. \u201cShe came back to the front desk, then went the back way to Kobe\u2019s room,\u201d avoiding Bryant\u2019s bodyguards.\nDuring the tour, Bryant complimented the woman on her appearance and her height. \u201cShe laughed at his jokes and thanked him for his compliments,\u201d Winters said she told him.\nHe invited her to his room, and Winters initially said she lifted her dress to show him a tattoo on her back. Later in the hearing, the detective amended the statement, saying he had \u201cconfused two interviews,\u201d and that the woman showed Bryant a tattoo on her ankle.\nThe woman declined Bryant\u2019s offer to join him in a hot tub, telling him her shift was about to end and she wanted to go home. Bryant then hugged her, which led to about five minutes of consensual kissing, the detective testified.\nThe kissing led to groping and the woman, according to the detective, began to resist. After she turned away from him to leave the room, \u201che grabbed her around the neck and moved with her to block her movements,\u201d Winters said.\nWinters said she could still breathe. Bryant forced her over a chair, let go of her neck with one hand and pulled down her panties.\nShe said, \u201c \u2018No,\u2019 \u201d Winters said.\nHenson and Abrahamson reported from Eagle, Colo. Teaford reported from Los Angeles."

      "text": "- Share via\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 The Dodgers finally landed a lot of little jabs as an offense Sunday against the San Diego Padres.\nAnd in a pivotal, sweep-evading 8-2 win at Petco Park \u2014 which once again tied the two teams for first place in the National League West standings \u2014 it allowed their slumping lineup to deliver some badly needed knockout blows.\nFor the first time this weekend, the Dodgers looked like themselves at the plate.\nThey bashed four home runs, none bigger than a tie-breaking three-run shot from backup catcher Dalton Rushing in the seventh that ultimately decided the game.\nThey strung together nine hits and four walks, cracking a Padres pitching staff that had smothered them over the first two games in this rivalry\u2019s final renewal of the season.\nWith Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez struggling defensively and Michael Conforto being a liability on offense, the Dodgers are exploring their outfield options.\nMost importantly, however, they did all the little things that have too often gone missing during their recent two-month funk; one in which they\u2019ve ranked 24th in the majors in scoring since the start of July, and let what was once a nine-game lead in the division turn into a dogfight down the stretch.\nThey extended at-bats. Battled with two strikes. And, at long last, earned the kind of pitches their star-studded roster could wallop.\n\u201cFor us to come out here and execute as an offense, way better than we did the last couple days, that\u2019s a big boost for us,\u201d said first baseman Freddie Freeman, who had two home runs to help the Dodgers salvage the series finale.\n\u201cWhen you expand the zone, the slugging percentage is going to go down, because pitchers are going to continue to expand,\u201d manager Dave Roberts added. \u201cBut when you earn good counts and get good pitches, control the zone, then slug happens. You can\u2019t always chase it. Which, I thought, today we did a really good job of.\u201d\nAhead of first pitch, Roberts spoke at length about the team\u2019s recent offensive struggles \u2014 following up on his Saturday night critique of the club\u2019s increasingly all-or-nothing approach.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really been in-sync,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s been disjointed a lot, as far as the offense.\u201d\nWhen asked if that meant his team needed to adopt more of a small-ball mentality, however, Roberts pushed back.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a fair question,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t disagree more.\u201d\nAfter all, his team is still stocked full of All-Stars, MVPs and future Hall of Famers. At their core, they are built to bludgeon opponents \u2014 not slap singles and drop down sacrifice bunts.\n\u201cSlugging is still a part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want guys to hit like I did.\u201d\nAround the margins, though, there were ways Roberts felt the Dodgers (74-57) could better position themselves to do that. Like trying to work better counts, stay alive with two strikes, and striking a better balance between patience and aggression.\n\u201cI want my cake, and [to] eat it as well,\u201d he quipped, a devilish smile on his face.\n\u201cI\u2019d be shocked,\u201d he added, \u201cif we don\u2019t see a different offensive output from here forward, starting today.\u201d\nThe change started in the first inning, with the Dodgers putting Padres starter Nick Pivetta under immediate stress.\nThe Dodgers\u2019 woes on offense continue, with the team unable to pick up their first hit until the sixth inning of a 5-1 loss to the San Diego Padres.\nShohei Ohtani drew a five-pitch leadoff walk. Mookie Betts shortened up his swing on an 0-and-2 slider to line a single up the middle. Freeman loaded the bases by grinding out a full-count free pass.\nIt was a string of small victories that provided cleanup hitter Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez the perfect chance to slug.\nHern\u00e1ndez tried to, getting a fastball over the plate in a 3-and-1 count and launching a deep fly ball that seemed destined to be a grand slam. The drive, however, hung up just enough for Ram\u00f3n Laureano to rob it at the wall.\nThe sacrifice fly brought in the Dodgers\u2019 only run of the inning \u2014 giving them a 1-0 lead that would soon be erased on Elias D\u00edaz\u2019s two-run homer in the third off Yoshinobu Yamamoto (the only runs he allowed in a six-inning start).\nStill, it set the tone for a flurry of offense that would follow, when a weekend of non-existent offense finally started to turn.\n\u201cGetting the guys on and scoring in that first inning was huge,\u201d Freeman sad. \u201cEven though we could have got more out of it, just getting one run across was a good boost for us coming off the last couple games.\u201d\nIn the sixth, Freeman hit his first home run of the day, crushing another center-cut fastball from Pivetta to right-center for a tying blast.\nThen, against Padres reliever Jeremiah Estrada in the seventh, the club put all the pieces together in a five-run rally.\nAndy Pages rolled a single through the left side to lead off. Michael Conforto came up next, fouled off a full-count slider, then took a borderline fastball at the top of the zone for a stress-inducing walk.\nMiguel Rojas couldn\u2019t get a bunt down after that, eventually swinging away for a fly out to center.\nBut, in what was easily his best moment of a trying rookie season, Rushing connected on the fatal blow seven pitches later \u2014 resetting after a bad first strike call, fouling off his own two-strike slider to keep the at-bat alive, then clobbering another slider to right for his go-ahead three-run homer.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m in the box and I get put in a hole, it\u2019s almost like, \u2018All right, I\u2019m going to find my way out,\u2019\u201d said Rushing, who entered the day batting just .184 with two home runs. \u201cI kind of played the game with him. He threw every pitch that he had, and I was totally banking on just being able to put a good swing on the ball whatever he threw.\u201d\n\u201cI think today,\u201d Roberts added, \u201cwas a big step in the right direction for him.\u201d\nThe same, of course, was true of the Dodgers\u2019 entire offense \u2014 which also got a second homer from Freeman later in the seventh, then another when Ohtani belted his 45th homer of the season in the ninth.\nThey got back to doing the little things right. They reeled off one big swing after another as a result.\n\u201cToday was more indicative of what we\u2019re going to do, we expect, going forward,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe fight, the grind, taking what the pitcher is giving you \u2014 and then if there\u2019s slug there, it\u2019s there. Just the byproduct of good at-bats all day.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nThat thick, wavy black hair once had no place atop Tino Sunseri\u2019s head.\nLong before he arrived in Westwood as UCLA\u2019s offensive coordinator and a GQ cover candidate, his father made him shave that glorious mane, the better to protect his head so that it would fit snugly inside his helmet as a young quarterback.\n\u201cI always had an emphasis of, \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t care how your frickin\u2019 hair looks or what women think,\u2019\u201d Sal Sunseri said. \u201cThe bottom line is, I wanted him to be secure.\u201d\nThis is how the Sunseris operate. Success means sacrifice. It\u2019s why Anthony Sunseri, Tino\u2019s grandfather and the family patriarch, would rise at 5 each morning to prepare for another day of running the family\u2019s Italian deli and grocery store in Pittsburgh. The man who called himself Tony Macaroni wouldn\u2019t come home until after 5 in the evening, only to tackle a stack of bills and other obligations just so that he could get to bed and rise to do it all over again.\n\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d Sal said of his father, \u201che would say, \u2018If you can\u2019t get up in the morning, you ain\u2019t worth a s\u2014\u2019 .\u201d\nUCLA\u2019s 2026 recruiting class that is ranked No. 22 nationally by 247Sports.com is on pace to become the Bruins\u2019 best since they finished No. 19 in 2018.\nTino was on the move practically from birth. The son of a college and NFL coach who schlepped him from Pittsburgh to Iowa Wesleyan to Illinois State to Louisville to Alabama A&M to Louisiana State to Michigan State to the Carolina Panthers by the time he was in middle school, Tino grew up with a sporting goods store\u2019s worth of gear and a deep appreciation for the players who wore all those helmets and jerseys.\nPerhaps the first coaching adage Tino learned was that if you win, you stay. If you lose, you move.\nA rare respite came when Sal spent seven glorious years as defensive line coach with Carolina. His wife, Roxann, would make 150 meatballs with garlic bread that Sal would distribute a few days after wins. Though intended for the defensive linemen, Sal would make sure to squirrel some away for other players such as running back DeShaun Foster.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a 10 out of 10,\u201d Foster said of the meatballs.\nIt was in the Panthers locker room that Tino, accompanying his father to work with wide eyes, first encountered the player who would one day become his boss. Reserved as he was, Foster found it easy to befriend the middle-school boy who dutifully slipped on rubber gloves to pick up jockstraps and jerseys.\n\u201cHe would come up to you as a young kid that looked up to all these NFL players, that was having all the success,\u201d Tino remembered, \u201cand would take the time to be able to talk to you, spend time with you and was really, really genuine.\u201d\nMore than two decades later, Sal was lounging on his couch when he got a call from Foster, now UCLA\u2019s coach, asking if he could have Tino\u2019s phone number. The request came only a few months after Foster and Tino shared a hug at the Rose Bowl, the first time they had reconnected since Foster\u2019s time with the Panthers. Tino\u2019s Indiana Hoosiers, thanks largely to the efforts of the quarterback he coached, had just walloped Foster\u2019s Bruins.\nDuring their brief exchange, Foster told Tino that he would hire him someday. That day was sooner than either might have imagined.\nThe first time he met reporters covering his new team, Tino Sunseri shook everyone\u2019s hand.\nThis is how the Sunseris operate. Respect matters. It\u2019s why Tino indulged every customer, both nasty and agreeable, while working his college summers as a bus boy and waiter at Bella Notte, the family restaurant in Pittsburgh known for its shredded pepperoni pizzas.\nHe\u2019d fully engage when he could, breaking out a big smile. Other times he\u2019d shift into keep-his-mouth-shut mode if he thought it might yield better results from someone who was being difficult.\n\u201cHe knows how to talk to people,\u201d said Nino Sunseri, Tino\u2019s uncle and godfather who runs the joint. \u201cIf you can get people who aren\u2019t nice to perform for you, picture what you can get nice people to do for you?\u201d\nWorking at the restaurant also taught Tino that he didn\u2019t want to do that sort of thing forever. If things broke his way, maybe he\u2019d be an NFL quarterback.\nBy then he\u2019d already led his Pittsburgh high school, Central Catholic \u2014 which also happened to be the alma mater of Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino and two-time Pro Bowler Marc Bulger \u2014 to a 16-0 season and state championship thanks to his strong arm and perfectionist streak. At Pittsburgh, where his mother had been a star gymnast and his father an All-America linebacker, Tino helped the Panthers reach three bowl games while piling up the third-most passing yards in school history.\nUndrafted yet undeterred, Tino pivoted to the Canadian Football League. He won a Grey Cup during his three seasons with the Saskatchewan Roughriders before being cut. His coaching start came with a former colleague of his father\u2019s when he joined Jimbo Fisher\u2019s Florida State staff before the 2016 season as a quality control assistant.\nTino would go on to work with some of the top offensive minds in the college game, culling ideas from Nick Saban and Steve Sarkisian during two seasons as a graduate assistant at Alabama. In 2021, he landed his first big job as quarterbacks coach under Curt Cignetti at James Madison.\n\u201cThose guys,\u201d Sal Sunseri said of his son\u2019s mentors, \u201cknew how to put points on the board.\u201d\nEyes wide once more, Tino watched closely, absorbing every tidbit.\nAs he went on to help Cignetti and Indiana achieve historic success during a 2024 season that ended in the College Football Playoff, somebody was increasingly keeping tabs on him.\n\u201cSeeing how he has evolved as a coach and everything,\u201d Foster said of the coach he hired in December, rewarding him with a two-year contract that will pay him $1.3 million this year, \u201cit just resonated, like, this is somebody that I wanted.\u201d\nSimilar to the way he handled customers at the family restaurant, Tino tailors his approach to each quarterback.\nSometimes that meant demonstrating what he wanted on the practice field or showing game footage of top quarterbacks making the right decisions. Other times, for the players who preferred to see plays spelled out with Xs and O\u2019s, he\u2019d diagram it on paper.\n\u201cHe wanted to get to know you,\u201d said Kurtis Rourke, the Indiana quarterback who led the Hoosiers to an 11-2 record last season before being drafted by the San Francisco 49ers, \u201cand know what learning style worked best with you.\u201d\nUCLA receiver Kwazi Gilmer says he wants to win the Biletnikoff Award, something no Bruins receiver has done.\nThis is how the Sunseris operate. Meticulousness matters. Rourke said that Tino\u2019s exacting nature bled into every quarterback, maximizing their potential. Indiana\u2019s quarterbacks coach and co-offensive coordinator would put plays up on the whiteboard and have everyone in the room explain every detail of what was supposed to happen.\n\u201cIt helped us learn and understand so that when we went out into the field it wasn\u2019t like, \u2018Whoa, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Rourke said. \u201cIt was very much second nature to us.\u201d\nIn his first season with the Hoosiers after transferring from Ohio, Rourke completed 69.4% of his passes for 3,042 yards and 29 touchdowns with only five interceptions.\nWinning big with a new quarterback was nothing new for Tino.\nIn Tino\u2019s first year at James Madison, veteran quarterback Cole Johnson helped the Dukes reach the semifinals of the Division I-AA playoffs. In 2022, transfer quarterback Todd Centeio (now a graduate assistant at UCLA) was part of a team that won the Sun Belt Conference\u2019s East Division title. A year later, Sunseri and Jordan McCloud, a transfer from Arizona, teamed to win another division title.\nWhat\u2019s Tino\u2019s formula? He said it\u2019s as much about continually assessing himself as much as his quarterbacks.\n\u201cDid I articulate this the right way? Is he receiving the information?\u201d Tino said, repeating the questions he asks himself. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not about what I know, it\u2019s what he knows and what he can apply. And so the biggest thing is making sure that you don\u2019t overload the computer and it shuts down. You want to make sure that you\u2019re consistently being able to give it data so that it can be able to make sure that it\u2019s ready to be able to have the information you need when you need it.\u201d\nComparing teaching football to fatherhood, Tino said it\u2019s essential to tell players not what they want to hear but what they need to hear to grow into the best version of themselves.\nWhat Nico Iamaleava, the highly rated transfer quarterback from Tennessee, has heard and seen makes him confident that his coach\u2019s history of immediate success could be on the verge of repeating itself.\nTino has been so active in practice drills, mimicking the footwork he wants and rolling out and firing a pass during one recent session, that he might as well pull on one of the quarterback\u2019s blue jerseys.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a high-energy guy, man,\u201d Iamaleava said of the coach who will turn 37 in December. \u201cHe just has that certain presence to him that makes you want to go play for him.\u201d\nLike his father, who liberally sprinkles \u201cfrickin\u2019\u201d and \u201cthe bottom line\u201d into conversation, Tino is fond of certain phrases. He inserts \u201cmake sure that\u201d and \u201cbe able to\u201d in almost every sentence, often multiple times.\nThis is how the Sunseris operate. Consistency and familiarity matter.\nThat\u2019s why many believe Tino\u2019s UCLA offense will look a lot like Indiana\u2019s, even if Tino wasn\u2019t the one calling plays for the Hoosiers when they rolled up 41.3 points and 426.4 yards per game last season, easily surpassing the 18.4 points and 328.8 yards that UCLA produced under Eric Bieniemy.\n\u201cI expect it to be similar to what Indiana\u2019s done and did last year,\u201d said Rourke, adding the caveat that he has not spoken with his former coach much since he took the UCLA job. \u201cYou know, his offense works, it\u2019s very fast-paced, it has [run-pass options] and a great passing attack.\u201d\nIt\u2019s clear from the snippets of practice reporters have been allowed to watch that presnap movement \u2014 designed to keep defenses guessing about the play call \u2014 will be a staple of the offense. Its design also appears to value efficiency over unnecessary gambles.\nIn an attempt to conceal his scheme before the season opener against Utah on Saturday at the Rose Bowl, Tino would only say that it\u2019s \u201ceverything\u201d that can squeeze the most out of his players\u2019 capabilities. His father predicted it would reflect all of his son\u2019s mentors over the years.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a combination of a little bit of Sark, a little bit of Jimbo, a little bit of frickin\u2019 Alabama,\u201d Sal Sunseri said, \u201cbecause he knows one thing, that you\u2019ve got to be able to run the ball and you\u2019ve got to be able to hit explosives.\u201d\nRecovering from a shoulder injury that required surgery, Sal won\u2019t be there Saturday to share another special moment at the Rose Bowl with his son. They had been at the stadium together in January 2014 when Sal was Florida State\u2019s defensive ends coach and the Seminoles beat Auburn to win the final Bowl Championship Series title game.\n\u201cThat Rose Bowl\u2019s been pretty good to him,\u201d Sal said, \u201cso hopefully he can go out there and do what the old man did and win some games.\u201d\nIt\u2019s certainly what he knows. This is how the Sunseris operate."
