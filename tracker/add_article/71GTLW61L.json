      "summary": "Ram has reintroduced the 5.7L Hemi V8 to its 2026 1500 lineup, pairing it with a 48‑volt eTorque hybrid system that adds 130 lb‑ft of launch torque and a 12 kW belt‑starter generator. The V8 package, priced at $1,200, comes with a standard GT exhaust and integrates seamlessly with the truck’s advanced electronic controls, delivering 395 hp and 410 lb‑ft while maintaining acceptable fuel economy. The hybrid assists with braking regen, traction control, and noise cancellation, allowing the truck to perform well in both towing and spirited driving scenarios. Ram’s move is driven by strong customer demand and aims to keep the 1500 competitive against rivals like the Ford F‑150 Raptor and Chevy Silverado.",
