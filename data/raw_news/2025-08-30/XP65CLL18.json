  "title": "Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea: Transfers TLDR",
  "description": "The Argentina winger has moved from Manchester United to Stamford Bridge for \u00a340m - we break down the deal",
  "content": "Chelsea have completed the signing of Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United for a fee of \u00a340million ($54m). The deal consists of a fixed fee, and United also receive a 10 per cent sell-on clause as part of the package. Garnacho has signed a contract through to 2032.\n\nAs part of this summer\u2019s transfer coverage on The Athletic, in addition to breaking news, tactical analysis and in-depth reads, our Transfers TLDR series (you can read them all here) will bring you a quick guide to each of the key deals.\n\nGive me his back story in 100 words\u2026\n\nAlejandro Garnacho became Manchester United\u2019s 243rd academy graduate to make his senior debut for the club when he came off the bench against Chelsea, who he has now joined, at Old Trafford in April 2022. The Madrid-born winger played for the academies of Getafe and later Atletico Madrid in his hometown before moving to United in 2020.\n\nHe represented Spain at youth level before switching allegiance to Argentina, where his mother is from, and was part of their 2024 Copa America-winning squad. He leaves United having won both domestic cups and, in 2024, the prestigious Puskas Award for this spectacular overhead-kick goal:\n\nWhat should and shouldn\u2019t I expect to see?\n\nApart from Mohamed Salah of Liverpool, Garnacho is the only current Premier League player to have a Puskas Award on display at home.\n\nHe is capable of jaw-dropping goals and is an aggressively creative winger, the kind of player you want to give the ball to as much as possible to see what magic he can muster. While he will get fans off their seats, Garnacho won\u2019t always play the right pass or be completely clinical in front of goal. He is a passion-fuelled forward who throws all caution to the wind in his eagerness to make things happen.\n\nHow will he fit tactically?\n\nGarnacho is a traditional winger, preferring to hug the touchline, as the map below of his attacking touches for United last season shows. His willingness to cut outside full-backs with either foot means he can play on both flanks.\n\nThe 21-year-old\u2019s natural tendencies were at odds with head coach Ruben Amorim\u2019s tactical approach at United, but should fit better at Chelsea. Enzo Maresca often used inverted full-backs last season, isolating his wingers against the opposition full-backs. Garnacho is at his best when doing exactly that at full throttle.\n\nHe is capable of spectacular finishes and loves to get shots away, but scored with only two of his 16 Opta-defined big chances in last season\u2019s Premier League. The Argentinian can occasionally over-dribble or delay simple passes too, but these qualities, along with his defensive work-rate, should improve with experience.\n\nGarnacho\u2019s injury history bodes well for Chelsea. He has had just one extended spell on the sidelines, after picking up an ankle problem in March 2023. This kept him out for 54 days and meant he missed 14 games in total but he was back before season\u2019s end as United, having won the Carabao Cup, finished third in the Premier League behind Manchester City and runners-up Arsenal and lost to City in the FA Cup final.\n\nSomeone who knows him says\u2026\n\n\u201cAlejandro always backed himself on the pitch. He had an unbelievable self-belief,\u201d Nick Cox, former director of United\u2019s academy, told The Athletic in March 2024.\n\nCox was involved in the negotiations with Atletico to sign Garnacho from his hometown club in summer 2020 \u2014 the year Covid-19 brought the world to a standstill.\n\n\u201cHe is a showman sometimes, who plays to the crowd in a positive sense,\u201d Cox said. \u201cHe has a desire to entertain. In the FA Youth Cup run (Garnacho helped United\u2019s under-18 side win that competition in the 2021-22 season, scoring twice as they beat Nottingham Forest 3-1 in the final), the bigger the game, the bigger the crowd, the better he was.\u201d\n\nWhat do we know about the finances of the deal?\n\nChelsea are paying United \u00a340million to bring Garnacho to Stamford Bridge. The winger has signed a seven-year contract, running to June 2032, at his new club.\n\nThis deal marks United\u2019s most lucrative ever sale of an academy graduate and is their fourth-highest fee received for any player, trailing only Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria. They have also secured a sell-on clause, entitling them to 10 per cent of any profit Chelsea make if Garnacho moves on.\n\nWhat impact will this have on both clubs\u2019 PSR calculation?\n\nAssuming agent payments of 10 per cent, alongside the Premier League\u2019s transfer levy, signing Garnacho will cost Chelsea \u00a345.6million in fees. That is without including whatever wage he will be paid over the next seven years in west London, which will be sure to push the overall cost of buying him considerably higher.\n\nThat seven-year contract is at odds with both Premier League and UEFA (European football\u2019s governing body) regulations limiting the length of time that player transfer fees can be amortised over.\n\nUnder Chelsea\u2019s assorted PSR (profitability and sustainability rules) calculations, they\u2019ll only be able to amortise Garnacho\u2019s fee over five years. A total of \u00a37.6million will therefore be booked in amortisation costs in 2025-26, \u00a39.1m in each of the four seasons after, and a small \u00a31.5m at the beginning of Chelsea\u2019s 2030-31 accounting period. There will be a disconnect between Chelsea\u2019s published accounts and their PSR submissions; in the accounts, Garnacho\u2019s amortisation cost will be around \u00a36.5m annually.\n\nUp in Manchester meanwhile, this sale generates significant profit. Garnacho was bought in October 2020 for an initial fee of just \u00a3150,000, potentially rising to \u00a3200,000. Pretty much all of the \u00a340million fee will be booked as profit in 2025-26 for United.",

      "text": "Chelsea have confirmed the signing of winger Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United.\nGarnacho, 21, has joined on a deal set to take him through to 2032 and is the second winger to join the London side from United in as many years, after Jadon Sancho.\nThe Athletic reported on Thursday that the clubs had agreed a deal worth consisting of a \u00a340million fixed fee and a 10 per cent sell-on clause, after reporting on August 7 that Chelsea had stepped up talks with Manchester United over the move.\nTake a seat, Alejandro. \ud83e\ude91 pic.twitter.com/P1n5nm0zXz\n\u2014 Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) August 30, 2025\nUpon joining the club, Garnacho said: \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible moment for my family and I to join this great club. I can\u2019t wait to get started.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special \u2013 we\u2019re the best team in the world! It\u2019s amazing to be here and I\u2019m very happy.\u201d\nGarnacho has not featured in any of United\u2019s matchday squads this season, after The Athletic reported in June that he was one of five United players permitted to return to pre-season training late after Amorim had told him, in front of his team-mates, to find a new club.\nChelsea have had a long-standing interest in the Argentina international who has had a turbulent relationship with United head coach Ruben Amorim in recent times.\nGarnacho joined United\u2019s academy from Atletico Madrid as a 16-year-old in October 2020. He has made 144 senior appearances for the Manchester club, registering 26 goals and 22 assists.\nThe winger has made eight international appearances for Argentina but has not been in the squad since November 2024.\n(Photo: Alex Livesey/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Alejandro Garnacho\u2019s closest watchers had seen it before. The second time was at Everton this season, already a favourite for the goal of the season. Yet two years earlier, he did what his coaches say was identical in an under-17s cup game.\nManchester United film every minute of every training session and every game. After his incredible bicycle kick at Goodison Park in late November, the staff came into the training ground the next day, excited. \u201cHe scored that goal at Wigan,\u201d they said to each other and demanded to see it again.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe do video all the time,\u201d explains Nick Cox, director of United\u2019s academy. \u201cBut the rain in Wigan that day became so bad that the cameras used by the analysts wouldn\u2019t work. His first goal was there but not the second. Can you believe it?\u201d\nGarnacho is enjoying a good season at Manchester United. He\u2019s starting every week, playing on the right and not just his usual left side, scoring and assisting. He\u2019s becoming a key player aged just 19 and became the first United player in Premier League history to win two penalties in one game in the return game against Everton.\nElsewhere on The Athletic\u2026\nHe might be one of this season\u2019s bright sparks, but United had been receiving scouting reports on the Madrid-born Argentine since he was 14. And that was down to the foresight of the club in setting up a comprehensive youth scouting network around Europe in 2016. One of the appointments that year was Gerardo Guzman, previously head of youth recruitment for Atletico Madrid.\nGuzman first saw Garnacho when he was 10 and at that stage the winger had informal links to Getafe. Liking his self-confidence, Guzman signed him for Atletico almost immediately. Guzman was well placed \u2013 Garnacho\u2019s family lived only 500 metres away from him in Arroyomolinos, a new town built in Madrid\u2019s fast-expanding southwestern suburbs, 30 kilometres from the centre of the Spanish capital.\nIt\u2019s a town of 4,000 who live in houses rather than apartments like many Spanish families. Garnacho had attended the same football school as Guzman\u2019s sons so they knew each other well and Guzman laughed as he heard stories of Garnacho playing in his front room and imagining that he was in a huge stadium. At Atletico, Garnacho quickly became a key player, a regular goalscorer from the age of 11 in 2015.\n\u201cGerardo Guzman is Mr Football and everyone in Spain knows him,\u201d says Cox. \u201cHe builds great relationships, he\u2019s got a warm character and he cares about young people. And now he\u2019s fallen in love with Man United. Gerardo deserves great praise for his work. It was a coup for us when we brought him in as a scout. Though he had less responsibility (than at Atletico), he saw it as a bigger club.\u201d\nInsider knowledge was key in bringing Garnacho to England. Guzman knew Garnacho wasn\u2019t happy at Atletico and that he would soon be out of contract. During lockdown, when Spain had one of the strictest in Europe, Guzman and the Garnachos worked out at the same gym and he could see how hard he was training. Other Spanish clubs were interested but none from England. And thanks to Guzman, none had the insight that United did.\nAdvertisement\nGarnacho\u2019s name had to go through a filtering process. Dave Harrison, who was top of academy recruitment, and Steve Brown (director of scouting), to whom Harrison reported, compared him to talents of a similar age in a similar position across other regions.\nWhy United needed Garnacho was partly down to Manchester City. All the 2020 new players coming in \u2014 Willy Kambwala was another \u2014 looked like a splurge before Brexit restrictions came in. In reality, United look closely at their players when they hit 16 and merge them with the age group above. Some are let go and United consider where the gaps are in their squad. United want the best local boys blended with the best international talent \u2014 and international talent was more economical.\n\u201cBack then, we could bring players from Europe across,\u201d explains Cox. \u201cMost of the big English clubs would also look to Europe. That year we had a lot of slots to fill.\u201d United had slots to fill because Garnacho\u2019s age group was raided by Manchester City, with several of the best talents moving from red to blue.\n\u201cIf we do our job properly, you should only ever have three or four gaps to fill,\u201d explains Cox. \u201cSo last year we brought in the two Fletcher boys, Harry Amass and Gabriele Biancheri. That feels about right to me. But in the year when Garnacho turned 16, we had more.\n\u201cWe\u2019re never trying to build a team, but a healthy pool of talent that is balanced and that can go and support the first team. And Man United has a way of playing, so there\u2019s a type of player we look for, plus we look at their character and temperament because moving to a new country at such a young age isn\u2019t easy. Then we look at their potential and whether they might be able to play in the Premier League in the future. Alejandro fitted the bill and was presented to me as the number one target. We shared video with the coaches and they were all aligned.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nUnited were attracted by his ability to beat players, his good (if not electric) pace, his strength with both feet. He wasn\u2019t seen as a generational talent. Harrison watched him once in person and studied videos of him. United would normally watch a player a lot more in person. That wasn\u2019t possible in 2020 due to Covid.\nJohn Murtough gave his approval, negotiations began and United got permission to speak to the player. Cox then had the job of selling United to the player, his family and the agent.\n\u201cIt was a weird time with lockdown,\u201d Cox remembers. \u201cOrdinarily you would have brought the player to Manchester and shown him around the facilities and stadium. Introduced them to the staff and talked to them about what we could do.\u201d\nInstead, a Zoom call was arranged between Cox, Steve Higham (head of academy football operations) and Alejandro, his agent and family.\n\u201cThere was not much English spoken,\u201d says Cox. \u201cGerardo helped. I was desperately trying to connect with this young person who I\u2019d never met and talk about our reputation for developing talent. I told him how much intelligence we had on him as a player to reassure him that it wasn\u2019t a knee-jerk reaction. We had reports on him since he was 14. And reassured mum that we were going to look after her boy.\u201d\nCox took the call in his spare bedroom, from where he was trying to run United\u2019s academy, and from where his own boys, then aged 14 and 10, would listen in. During the call with the Garnachos, the boys were arguing.\n\u201cI still tell my boys that if the argument rumbled on much longer, then we probably wouldn\u2019t have Alejandro Garnacho at Manchester United!\u201d But Garnacho did sign. And for a price that now looks like a bargain.\nManchester United signed him on a pre-contract as he couldn\u2019t sign as a pro until 17. Garnacho\u2019s transfer fee was just \u00a3150,000 guaranteed, with \u00a350,000 depending on targets being achieved. Atletico also wanted to keep him and offered a similar amount to United: \u00a370,000 per year, rising to \u00a390,000 within the deal.\nThen there were further complications in the summer of 2020. \u201cAlejandro couldn\u2019t travel to join the club as it was lockdown,\u201d Cox says. \u201cOur boys didn\u2019t report back until later, in July in 2020, when we were told the season could go ahead.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nEven then it wasn\u2019t straightforward and Garnacho had to do two weeks in isolation in his new country.\n\u201cMoving to Manchester United is hard in the best of circumstances,\u201d says Cox. \u201cAlejandro had to do it with the odds stacked against him. He\u2019d normally be able to make friends and see the city and get to know his coaches. He spent two weeks in quarantine. We tried to teach him English in video calls, put fitness sessions on with him in the garden \u2013 via videos. He was only 16 and needed to continue with his education.\u201d\nAfter those two weeks, life was far from normal for this first-year scholar. To protect the first-team bubble, United\u2019s under-18s and 21s decamped to one of the club\u2019s training grounds at Littleton Road in Salford, where a marquee was erected. The players had to arrive changed and were only allowed to train for 75 minutes per day, while keeping social distance \u2014 there was no close contact. Gym use was banned, everything was outside. As he played amid the terraced houses of Salford, Garnacho could have been excused for thinking that this wasn\u2019t quite what he signed up for when United was sold to him as the biggest club in the world.\nNew players usually build relationships first with coaches, medics, athletic development coaches, psychologists and analysts. United tried to help young players by setting up Zoom calls with established players and coaches including Michael Carrick, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Darren Fletcher and Wes Brown. That was great, but Garnacho couldn\u2019t understand any of them.\nMarc Jurado and Alvaro Fernandez, two other Spanish youngsters who joined at the same time, offered great support. They learned and laughed together as they found their way in a new country, turning their noses up at English food, wondering why English people eat and go to bed so early.\nHis family, who moved to be with him, went to games, sitting in the away end.\nYet Garnacho\u2019s journey at United was far from straightforward. It seldom is.\nAdvertisement\nHe took time adjusting to the English approach and was too relaxed to begin with. He was a young kid learning and was allowed to make mistakes, but coaches felt that he got into his stride after six months at the club.\n\u201cHe was a slow burner in his first year, he wasn\u2019t ripping trees up,\u201d says Cox. \u201cHe made his debut for the youth team at Man City when he came on as a sub and found it all a little bit quick.\u201d\nIn July 2021 he signed his first professional contract and the signs of his talent really started to show.\n\u201cAlejandro always backed himself on the pitch, he had an unbelievable self-belief,\u201d says Cox. \u201cHe is a showman sometimes who plays to the crowd, in a positive sense. He has a desire to entertain. In the (2022) Youth Cup run, the bigger the game, the bigger the crowd, the better he was.\u201d\nGarnacho was shining and won the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award. He scored an audacious overhead kick against Scunthorpe similar to the one at Everton, but closer to goal. Young fans waited for him afterwards. Against Everton in the next round, he ran at the full-back from the halfway line and, leaving him floundering and beaten, he cut inside and buried the ball in the corner. In the hard-fought quarter-final against Leicester, Garnacho saved his side by scoring twice in the second half, including an 88th-minute winner. Wolves were next.\nGarnacho tried to learn as much as he could about the players he was about to face, travelling to Molineux to study Wolves\u2019 full-backs \u2014 he and his dad regularly studied his opponents, though usually on video. Then he slinked past the right-back like a young Ryan Giggs and scored as Wolves were defeated 3-0.\nIn the final, in front of 67,000 fans, Garnacho snatched two in the last 12 minutes as United lifted the Youth Cup for the first time since 2011. His celebrations, the first Ronaldo-esque, the second as he took his shirt off, showed no lack of self-confidence.\nAdvertisement\nAs 2021-22 closed, he made his first-team debut, a one-minute cameo against Chelsea. Cox punched the air in delight. His parents, invited into the directors\u2019 box, cried as he came on. \u201cHis family are amazing people, passionate football people,\u201d says Cox.\nUnder Ralf Rangnick in early 2022, Garnacho was back and forward between the first team and the youth team. Darren Fletcher was excellent in supporting him during this stage and continued to champion him on the Asia and Australia pre-season tour after Erik ten Hag joined the club. The youth coaches expected him back after that tour, but he never came.\nAs well as putting his arm around the player, Fletcher was involved in another way. When Garnacho was called up to Argentina\u2019s senior squad \u2014 he qualified through his mother \u2014 even before he\u2019d made his United debut, United\u2019s staff held a video call with the Argentinian FA. He was about to be put into the main national squad alongside Lionel Messi, a big deal, and United felt they had to be on the same page.\nNobody at United got carried away.\n\u201cHe was 18, and when you\u2019re 18 you can be a little loose,\u201d says Cox. \u201cThat\u2019s normal. You might have your flip-flops on and not your trainers. You might not bring your water bottle when you\u2019re supposed to bring your water bottle. They\u2019re little things, but they become more apparent when you\u2019re standing next to Casemiro and you\u2019re the new kid at work with someone who has had 20 years of this professional lifestyle.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got good attacking flair and there\u2019s real potential there,\u201d said his former boss Neil Wood in October 2022. \u201cHe\u2019s still got a lot to learn and a lot of development to go through. There\u2019s no doubt that he has talent, can score individual goals and that he\u2019s good at dribbling. But there are areas he needs to improve \u2014 his passing, keeping the ball, protecting the ball, hiding the ball when he\u2019s dribbling, being more productive with his end product, creating more assists.\u201d\nAnd he began to improve. In November 2022, United played an important Champions League game back in Spain at Real Sociedad. Twenty members of his family and friends travelled up from Madrid. Garnacho was set up by Cristiano Ronaldo to score and said it was the sweetest moment of his life. His father, sat among United fans in the main stand, was crying his eyes out.\nAdvertisement\nThe following month, United were back in Spain again for a supposed warm-weather training camp in Andalusia. It rained every day. On the waterlogged pitch, Garnacho was doing little in training until a group of media turned up. Immediately he turned it on with an array of runs and shots. A showman.\nHe finished last season coming on in the FA Cup final as United tried in vain to get an equaliser against Manchester City. Replacing Christian Eriksen on 61 minutes, his arrival was cheered by fans who knew their side needed to be bolder. Garnacho made clever runs, touches and shot wide. Once again his father was in tears in the stand watching his son.\nJurado and Fernandez left United so Garnacho has been busy building new friendships. He\u2019s a popular, level-headed member of a squad that has undergone a difficult season, yet those difficulties have given him chances. Be it Jadon Sancho being banished or Antony\u2019s poor form, space has appeared on the right for United.\nGarnacho signed a new contract last year until 2028. More recently, United produced a video internally to show his time at the club.\nThe video starts with the highs and his recent goals and assists, like for Bruno Fernandes\u2019s winner in the 91st minute at Fulham. Then the tone changes and it shows the earlier versions of the player, the one coaches worked on to improve his left-foot crosses. Several clips are shown of him overhitting crosses in youth games. Another shows how he needed to improve his positioning and work rate.\nHe did just that and more. He worked on cutbacks and crossing. He learned to play as a nine or 10, to better his positioning and be ready to jump on a poor pass from opponents. His work rate went up and up. He was taught to finish better. Practice, practice, practice.\nThe video finishes with Erik ten Hag putting his arm around his player as his girlfriend (they recently became parents) and beaming parents watch on.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThis new contract is deserved by his performance,\u201d says Ten Hag. \u201cHe had to fight his way into the team and it was a huge step, but he\u2019s been magnificent. I hope that his new contract is a motivation and inspiration to do even better.\u201d\n\u201cHe stands for everything that Manchester United is about: he\u2019s individual, young, energetic, aggressive,\u201d the twice-assistant manager Mike Phelan tells The Athletic.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an intelligent player who understands his role in the team, takes risks and gets bums off seats. He\u2019s going to make mistakes, young players do, but he\u2019s got an edge, a skill factor. If he continues to learn and take on information and grow quickly as a player, he\u2019s got a great future.\u201d\nGarnacho has played with both Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. A heart-breaking reminder of this came recently when Anderson, a seven-year-old United fan who adores Garnacho and who has undergone a year of chemotherapy, needed to provide an emergency question which is asked when the disease is at its worst and doctors or parents need a cognitive response. Anderson\u2019s question is: \u201cWho has played with Messi and Ronaldo?\u201d It was used a lot last year.\nUnited invited Anderson to Carrington, explaining that they wanted to ask him about the Spurs game he\u2019d attended. Instead, it was to meet Garnacho.\nThe player, a new father himself, was drawn to the story and visibly emotional when meeting Anderson. He called him \u201cheroic\u201d and \u201cbrave\u201d.\nThis happened in January, when he was having his best time as a United player. Just before, on Boxing Day, he scored twice as United came from 2-0 down to beat Aston Villa 3-2.\nOn February 1, he played at Wolves where he was a threat on the right and involved in two goals. He was even better against West Ham a few days later, as United won their first home game of the season in the league by more than one goal, scoring twice and balancing alongside Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund on an advertising hoarding. The following day, he came in on a rest day to train alone in the gym.\nAdvertisement\nUnited have struggled in recent weeks but the two penalties he won against Everton at Old Trafford have kept alive dreams of Champions League football next season.\nOnce again \u2018Viva Garnacho\u2019 \u2014 to the tune of his hero \u2018Viva Ronaldo\u2019 \u2014 could be heard from the United fans. Much like that night at Goodison with the spectacular bicycle kick.\nWas it as good as that goal at Wigan? We\u2019ll never know.\nGO DEEPER\nAlan Shearer on the biomechanical beauty of the overhead kick\n(Top image: PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty Images)"
