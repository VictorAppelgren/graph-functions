  "title": "Are Wall Street Analysts Bullish on HCA Healthcare Stock?",
  "description": "HCA Healthcare has underperformed the broader market over the past year, and analysts are moderately optimistic about the stock\u2019s prospects.",
  "content": "HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA), headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, owns and operates hospitals and related healthcare entities. Valued at $94.6 billion by market cap, the company provides diagnosis, treatments, consultancy, nursing, surgeries, and other services, as well as medical education, a physician resource center, and training programs.\n\nShares of this healthcare service provider have underperformed the broader market over the past year. HCA has gained 7.3% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 13.3%. However, in 2025, HCA\u2019s stock rose 34.7%, surpassing the SPX\u2019s 8.3% rise on a YTD basis.\n\u2022 Should You Buy the Dip as Palantir Stock Falls for 7 Straight Days?\n\u2022 George Soros Is Betting Big on Beaten-Down UnitedHealth Stock. Should You?\n\u2022 2 \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 Stocks Offering Fat Yields of Over 7.5% in August 2025\n\u2022 Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nNarrowing the focus, HCA\u2019s outperformance is apparent compared to the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF). The exchange-traded fund has declined about 18.4% over the past year. Moreover, HCA\u2019s double-digit gains on a YTD basis outshine the ETF\u2019s 3.3% losses over the same time frame.\n\nOn Jul. 25, HCA shares closed down more than 2% after reporting its Q2 results. Its revenue increased 6.4% year over year to $18.6 billion. The company\u2019s adjusted EPS came in at $6.84, up 24.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect HCA\u2019s EPS to grow 19.8% to $26.30 on a diluted basis. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 26 analysts covering HCA stock, the consensus is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 13 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, two \u201cModerate Buys,\u201d and 11 \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is less bullish than a month ago, with 14 analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 4,Benjamin Rossi from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) maintained a \u201cHold\u201d rating on HCA with a price target of $370.\n\nWhile HCA currently trades above its mean price target of $401.14, the Street-high price target of $444 suggests a 9.8% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Neha Panjwani did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
