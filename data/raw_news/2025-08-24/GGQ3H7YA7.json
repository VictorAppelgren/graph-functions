  "description": "There are a lot of things you'll need to consider when building out a surround sound audio system in your home, but they're all very important.",
  "content": "4 Key Things To Consider When Building Your Home Surround Sound System\n\nCertain things signify a level of well-earned luxury on the home front. While things like a swimming pool, high-end appliances, and the latest in smart home gadgetry tend to dominate such conversations, for some homeowners, the luxury line is officially crossed with the setup of a snazzy surround sound system in their living room. That's particularly true for folks who prefer to spend their nights, weekends and holidays perched comfortably on the couch or in a recliner as they watch the latest hit series or major motion picture to hit the streaming realm. If such entertainment is your primary pastime, you no doubt prefer your home viewing experience to resemble, as closely as possible, the one you have when you visit the local movie theater. And to do that, you'll need to properly outfit your space with the requisite surround sound system. There is, of course, more to setting up a home surround sound system than just getting your hands on the right gear. In fact, to do surround sound the right way, most audio experts might be quick to tell you that there are dozens of factors to consider when plotting out your setup, and that the devil is indeed in the details when it comes to optimizing sound. Here are a few things they might encourage you to consider when building out your home surround sound system.\n\nYour audio goals will also impact the components you need Selecting what components and audio accoutrements to utilize in your system will easily be among the most important decisions you make. And yes, those decisions will likely also rank among the most difficult, if only because there are so many brands of note and products at play in the audio arena these days. But before you begin searching through the various speakers and components you'll need to complete your system, you need to ask yourself what your ultimate goal is for your sonic experience. For instance, if your primary goal is to recreate the theatrical experience when you're binging away on the couch, you'll need to ensure that you've procured components and an array of surround speakers that are capable of delivering the multi-channel sound affixed to most movies and television shows being produced today. Yes, the surround sound you desire when watching movies is very different from the 2-channel stereo sound you typically hear when you're rocking out to the pop tunes, punk rock, or Pavarotti that may currently be occupying your Spotify playlist. If music is a master in your home, a surround sound system geared towards that may be best. Even as amplifiers and receivers should offer optimized audio options for both movie sound and music, if the sound of cinema is important to you, you should prioritize components built to bolster those features.\n\nWhen researching components, you'll want to pay attention to their audio channels and which surround sound format they are best-equipped to support. These days, the most prominent formats come from Dolby Labs and DTS. Yes, both surround sound formats are regularly featured at modern multiplexes. Each format has also long been available for home theater use. However, each may offer slightly different returns in your surround sound experience, with the belief being that DTS' less compressed, higher bitrate setup may offer better clarity, even as Dolby remains a go-to format in the industry. Audio channels are, understandably, a big part of the surround sound format conversation, as the general rule of thumb is that the more channels you have, the more immersive your surround sound should be. Both Dolby and DTS systems offer similar channel ranges, from 5.1 up to 11.1. For now, 5.1 is still a relatively common layout in the sound industry, with many streamers offering content in that audio range. For what it's worth, Dolby is the format favored by many of the more prominent streaming services, including Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, Apple TV+, and Max. Those factions also support Dolby's Atmos surround sound if you're looking for components and speaker packages with that capability. Likewise, Disney+ even supports DTS:X for some IMAX and MCU content if you're looking at that high-end package. In terms of physical media, most DVDs are optimized for Dolby Digital, though they may also support DTS audio packages.\n\nRoom acoustics and speaker placement can make or break your surround sound setup Once you've made those decisions, it's time to consider room acoustics and speaker setup. For those of you lucky enough to be building a home theater from the ground up, this will be less of an issue, as you'll be able to design a room specifically to optimize your sonic desires. It's safe to assume, however, that most folks are working with a pre-existing space in their home, which will require a little more layout planning. It may prove fortuitous that said space likely already resembles a movie theater, as the rectangular layout is considered ideal for an immersive surround sound setup, and many living rooms indeed fit that bill. Even still, there are other factors to consider, like the overall size of the room, or the location of your furniture and wall hangings, as each will affect the manner in which sound is distributed throughout the space. In general, the idea is to limit objects that might block or reflect sound, as this can unbalance acoustics on the high and low ends of the sonic spectrum. Once your furniture is placed, speaker setup can begin. The general logic is that larger speakers and a center speaker should be situated directly in front of your seating, with smaller \"surround\" speakers placed slightly behind on either side. Likewise, if you've gone the Atmos route, additional speakers may need to be fixed to your ceiling. In-room sound design can be a legit make-or-break science, meaning it may pay to consult an acoustics expert when you're setting up your surround sound system.\n\nBudget is a big part of putting a system together With those factors covered, one could easily argue that the first thing you need to think about before you head out to the closest electronics store is exactly how much money you're willing to spend on the setup. And for the sake of being crystal clear on this point, buying the requisite components you'll need to properly set up your system will likely be a pricey endeavor, as receivers, amplifiers, woofers, and speakers from even the lower-end electronics brands may not come cheap. On the high end of the market, such a setup could easily cost many thousands of dollars. Given those facts, it is, understandably, vital that you come up with a dollar amount you're comfortable with spending on your surround sound experience. It's even more important that you actually stick to that budget when you start shopping, 'cause it can be all too easy to get swept up and inadvertently drop some serious green when you're plotting out your home theater setup. The good news is that electronics big box retailers like Best Buy offer more budget-friendly options in the surround sound arena, often packaging receivers, speakers, and woofers together at a lower cost than you might see purchasing each individually. These days, most electronics manufacturers are also making soundbars that claim to deliver room-filling surround sound (including even Dolby Atmos) to your home theater setup in one easy-to-manage package \u2014 though prices can be pretty steep for a high-end soundbar as well.",

      "text": "What Brand Is Best Buy's Most Affordable Surround Sound System & What Does It Cost?\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nThere was a time when surround sound was well out of the reach of most consumers' wallets. This changed during the DVD boom of the aughts: Very inexpensive systems, usually referred to as \"home theaters in a box\" (HTIB for short) made their way to retail, and for most people, they were good enough. Suddenly, you didn't need to spend several hundred dollars on a receiver and speakers; you could spend $100 to $300 and get a self-contained system that would perform perfectly fine when it came to giving you an immersive experience watching movies or even music mixed for surround, even if they wouldn't necessarily qualify as hi-fi.\nIn recent years, though, soundbars with \"virtual surround\" modes have largely pushed out HTIBs. For a true surround experience, you generally need to spend at least $600 to bundle a speaker set and a receiver, but there are exceptions. And at electronics superstore chain Best Buy, there's one particularly big exception: Vizio's V51-H6, a soundbar with semi-wireless surround speakers that enable full surround sound in a package that retails for just $249.99, or under $200.00 for My Best Buy Plus members or Amazon customers.\nFinding a genuine surround system for $200 to $250 is incredibly rare these days, so you might be skeptical of what Vizio's selling here. But with a 4.5-star average out of five from customers on both Best Buy and Amazon's websites amidst thousands of user reviews, plus positive professional reviews, it's worth taking a deeper look at.\nIt's the Vizio V51-H6 soundbar with wireless subwoofer and semi-wireless surrounds\nBy \"semi-wireless\" surround sound, we mean that the V51-H6 has some wires, but they won't run across your living room floor. The soundbar connects wirelessly to the subwoofer, and that subwoofer is designed to be stationed next to your couch. The satellite surround speakers are then wired \u2014 with very long included speaker wires \u2014 to the subwoofer, so the cables can run neatly behind your couch.\nNumerous professional reviewers have weighed in on the V51-H6, and they've been very positive. Most notably, both Digital Trends and USA Today's Reviewed gave the budget system their \"Editors' Choice\" recommendations. In listing the pros of the Vizio package, Digital Trends praised its ease of setup, \"[i]mmersive surround sound,\" and the pleasant surprise that was its music reproduction abilities, as that can be a weak spot in this kind of budget surround sound system. \"For a couple hundred dollars, this 5.1-channel surround system really has no business being so robust and flexible,\" concluded that review.\nCNN Underscored, Consumer Reports, Soundbars.com, and RTINGS all delivered praise across the board for the V51-H6, as well. Taken together, it's pretty clear: If you're looking to upgrade your living room's sonic experience but don't have much to spend, it seems like it's pretty hard to beat the Vizio V51-H6 at a retail price of $249.99 and going as low as roughly $200.00."

      "text": "Every Major Surround Sound Brand Ranked By Top Reviews\nIf you've always wanted to create an incredible audio experience at home, choosing the right surround sound system is key. Here, we've scoured the best brands in the industry based on factors like top reviews, innovation, and value for money. These brands have earned a reputation for being excellent investments in home audio.\nWhen considering a surround sound system, it's important to think about your specific needs. Factors such as budget, room size and layout, usage, and personal preferences play an important role in helping you choose the right system. Whether you're a movie buff looking for cinema-quality sound, a music enthusiast, or simply wanting to improve your home entertainment setup, there's a system made for your needs.\nEach brand on our list brings something unique to the table. From cutting-edge technology and feature-rich systems to budget-friendly options that don't compromise on quality, these brands have made their mark in the world of surround sound. We'll consider what makes each brand stand out, from the specific features that cater to various user requirements to what top reviews are saying about them. We're looking at the best in the business to discover how these top-rated surround sound brands can transform your listening experience. Whether you're setting up your first home theater or looking to upgrade, these insights can help you make an informed decision.\nWharfedale\nThe first brand on the list was founded in 1933, originally as the Wharfedale Wireless Works, by Gilbert Briggs. Since then, the Wharfedale company has had its hand in speaker manufacturing for commercial, military, and residential needs.\nSince 1933, the Wharfedale brand has built its reputation as a quality manufacturer, but what set it apart was its quality to price ratio. Wharfedale's speaker and surround sound systems are by no means cheap, ranging anywhere between a few hundred dollars to thousands. However, even their cheapest speakers have been noted by HiFi Trends as having excellent sound quality, high above its price point.\nWharfedale has several different speaker and surround sound product lineups. Its most notable line is perhaps the Diamond series, which was originally conceived in 1981 and has been continuously improved upon over time. It is currently in its 12th iteration. The Diamond 12 is an impressive blend of innovations, with numerous technologies to reduce unwanted vibrations in the speaker and produce excellent sound at a reasonable price \u2014 around $500.\nWharfedale is not only limited to budget-friendly products, however. The company's high-end line of speakers, the Aura, starts in the thousands, and goes up from there.\nOnkyo\nFounded in 1946 by Takeshi Godai in Osaka, Japan, Onkyo has established itself as an innovator in the sound industry. Starting with a customized record cartridge, Onkyo has continuously developed in-house components and systems.\nOnkyo surround sound systems are some of the most beginner-friendly sound systems that users can buy. They are easy to set up and notably come with an impressive receiver that's packed with features and compatibility, a bonus that's often overlooked by other manufacturers.\nThe entry-level option in Onkyo's range is the SR series. Priced at around $600, this complete surround sound package includes the TX-SR494 receiver, a center speaker, four surround speakers, and a subwoofer. With the receiver alone priced at $450, it's clear that the investment primarily focuses on the quality of the receiver.\nFor those new to home audio or seeking a basic starter system, the SR series offers a solid foundation with the flexibility for future upgrades. The TX-SR494 receiver supports direct wire connections, allowing for the integration of various speaker brands beyond Onkyo's offerings.\nIf you're looking for a receiver, many reviewers have pointed to Onkyo products for their reliability, features, and price points. Home Cinema Choice revisited their review of the Onkyo TX-NR6100 and found it an excellent value. It includes features like built-in Chromecast that, while not essential, do add convenience and reduce clutter, for a cleaner look to your installed system.\nPolk\nPolk Audio has created a niche in the audio industry by offering audiophiles an immersive listening experience without the steep prices typically associated with high-fidelity (HiFi) systems. Founded as a startup over 50 years ago by George Klopfer and Matthew Polk, the company began by handcrafting speaker systems for grassroots bands. With the addition of Sandy Gross, the team expanded their venture, innovating and creating audio equipment right from their shared apartment.\nThis quintessentially American startup story has shaped Polk Audio's ethos as a company dedicated to delivering high-quality audio equipment. Polk stands out for its commitment to catering to discerning audiophiles without the pretense or inflated costs often found in the industry.\nPolk Audio boasts a comprehensive lineup of surround sound systems designed to accommodate various spaces and preferences. For smaller spaces like apartments, its React 4.1 surround system is an ideal choice. It features the React soundbar as its main component, delivering clear audio in a small package. Reviewers like Tech Hive and Tech Radar were impressed with the quality of its sound at an extremely affordable price.\nOn the complete opposite end of the spectrum is the Reserve R700 Platinum system that comes with enough equipment and speakers to start your own theater. In addition, it's compatible with the Dolby Atmos system that allows users to experience surround sound with height differentials offering a whole new dimension to the experience.\nLogitech\nLogitech is known for its reliable PC peripherals and accessories. The company has built an impressive reputation for a wide variety of products like speakers, headphones, and computer mice, often having dozens of different affordable options for any type of gaming or PC accessory you can imagine. This makes it a little surprising that Logitech currently only has one complete surround sound system in its lineup: the Logitech Z906 5.1 surround sound system. However, it does have numerous options for smaller sound systems and speakers.\nWith so many different audio brands out there, Logitech has solidified itself as a budget-friendly, mid-tier brand. The product offerings may not look the most exciting or flashy, but they work well and often at a fraction of the price of their competitors. According to Tech Spot, the Z906 is fantastic with a gaming rig or movies, offering crisp and powerful sound. What makes that even more impressive is that it does so with a price tag under $400.\nHowever, to get to the low price point, Logitech did make some sacrifices. The Z906 is THX-certified to offer true movie theater quality surround sound, and is also able to play Dolby Digital and DTS (Digital Theater Systems) encoding, which is great, but it's missing HDMI connections.\nDali\nHailing from Scandinavia, Danish Audiophile Loudspeaker Industries, or Dali, has been crafting speaker systems since 1983. The company's guiding principle has always been to deliver sound that's as close to 'authentic' as possible. This ambition is evident in its speakers and systems, which are brimming with proprietary technology for vibration dampening and other innovations, resulting in an impressive array of audio products.\nWhile the name Dali might inadvertently conjure images of the surreal artist Salvador Dali, the connection ends there. However, you wouldn't be far off in thinking of its speakers as artwork in their own right. Dali's speakers are works of meticulous craftsmanship, blending futuristic elements with timeless design. Their Kore and Epikore series feature futuristic bevels and curves, while the Oberon series embraces a classic, timeless aesthetic.\nDali's range is vast, catering to audiophiles and casual listeners alike. A case in point is its Oberon 7c, a relatively simple Bluetooth surround sound system that has garnered high praise. In their review, Audioholics highlighted the system's ease of setup that's as straightforward as pressing a connect button. The Oberon 7c also reduces wire clutter, offering a streamlined experience. However, it's important to note that it primarily connects the speaker and receiver via Bluetooth. For those seeking more control and uncompressed audio quality, Dali's Kore series or other lines might be the better choice.\nQ Acoustics\nDespite being a relatively new player in the audio industry, Q Acoustics has quickly established itself as a brand to watch since its inception in 2006. Entering the market with the ambitious goal of offering competitively priced HiFi speakers, Q Acoustics has not only met but exceeded expectations. In just three years, they showcased their innovative drive by introducing systems specifically designed to enhance flat-screen TV audio, a first in the industry at the time.\nTechRadar found Q Acoustics to be the perfect boost for listeners looking to upgrade their standard TV speakers. While reviewing the M20 bookshelf speaker they stated that, \"The M20 HD delivers a significant improvement on the majority of built-in TV audio systems.\" This endorsement highlights Q Acoustics' ability to offer a substantial upgrade from standard TV speakers.\nThe latest achievement from Q Acoustics is the 5000 series, a line that builds upon the success of their Concept series. This new series incorporates the proprietary Continuous Curved Cone profile, ensuring smoother high frequencies and deeper bass. Moreover, each speaker in the 5000 series employs Q Acoustics' Point-2-Point (P2P) Bracing system, a feature meticulously designed to minimize vibrations within the speaker's casing, further refining the audio output.\nSonos\nSonos is known for their excellent wireless and smart speaker systems. Each speaker is designed to seamlessly sync together, and users can easily create customized home sound systems by simply adding Sonos speakers to your home until you're satisfied. It's an impressive design that makes it easy to set up a surround sound system anywhere in your house.\nStarting your Sonos journey is a simple task. The company has various starter bundles with a soundbar and a couple of side speakers for newbies to dip their toes in the water. From there, you can add more depth to your system with subwoofers, bring in some smaller HiFi speakers, or even grab the Sonos Move, their handy portable speaker.\nThe Sonos Move is not just any speaker. It is a portable indoor/outdoor speaker that's designed to work with your integrated Sonos system, or as a standalone speaker that can easily be moved from room to room, or from house to your backyard BBQ. PCMag gave it two thumbs up for its sturdy design and was impressed with how easy it is to use \u2014 from its handy app controls to the smart Alexa integration.\nSennheiser\nAfter 75 years, Sennheiser is still family owned and operated, and is one of the biggest names in audio technology in the world. Started in Germany in 1945 by Fritz Sennheiser, the Sennheiser company was founded on the principles of innovation and the pursuit of recreating the perfect sound from their devices.\nOne of its most unique products is the Sennheiser Ambeo Max Soundbar. Unlike traditional setups requiring multiple speakers, the Ambeo Max employs a unique design to create an immersive sound environment from a single unit. This product incorporates 3D audio technology, including Dolby Atmos and MPEG-4 standards, to enhance the home audio experience. The soundbar will automatically detect the size of the room and its location in the room during setup by sending sound waves to the ceiling and measuring the feedback. With only a single soundbar, you can turn most living rooms into an amazing home theater.\nIndustry experts have been blown away by Ambeo's capabilities. It challenges the conventional setup of multiple surround sound speakers by delivering a comparable, if not superior, audio experience. Reviewers like WhatHiFi have noted that while the Ambeo Max's price point might align with that of multiple smaller speakers, its performance in delivering 3D sound really stands out.\nKlipsch\nMany startups say they're founded on hope, but Klipsch Audio was literally founded in Hope, Arkansas. Started by Paul W. Klipsch in a small tin shed, Klipsch Audio has been producing and innovating sound technology since 1946. Paul Klipsch's first innovative design was the horned speaker nicknamed the Klipschorn. His goal was to create an orchestra-level sound right in the user's living room. It's the only speaker in the world that's been in continuous production for over 70 years.\nWith such a long-standing heritage in the audio world, it's no wonder that Klipsch has been at the top of numerous audio review sites. The company continues to take Paul Klipsch's original design and refine it for the modern market. Home Theater Review describes Klipsch speakers as \"big speakers with a big sound, that beg you to turn it up.\"\nThe Cinema 1200 5.1.4 surround system is its latest in Klipsch's home audio offerings. Not only does it feature an aesthetically pleasing design, but it's also equipped with an array of features. The system includes customizable audio modes, easily adjustable with the touch of a button. These settings allow users to enhance vocal clarity or amplify action sequences instantly. There are even nighttime modes that limit subwoofer use so that you can keep the peace with your neighbors.\nBowers & Wilkins\nFounded in 1966 by John Bowers and Roy Wilkins, Bowers & Wilkins has dedicated itself to the pursuit of reproducing sound in its purest form. The company's guiding principle has been to make speakers that recreate sound as close as humanly possible to artists in a recording studio. This philosophy can be seen in a quote from the founder John Bowers, \"The best loudspeaker isn't the one that gives the most. It's the one that loses the least.\"\nBowers & Wilkins speakers are designed to replicate what they call the \"True Sound\" by replicating a faithful replication of original music recordings by artists in sound studios. This has led Bowers & Wilkins to be one of the most respected names in speakers for home and professional use.\nDuring a baseline test of Bowers & Wilkins floor speakers, HiFiCentre tested the 600, 700, and 800 series tower speakers. Starting with the lowest tier, the 600, they were amazed at the sound quality and were skeptical that the subsequent generation could improve on it. However, the 700 and 800 series speakers surpassed these high expectations. Notably, despite their premium pricing, these speakers were considered a justified investment for serious audiophiles, offering a level of sound fidelity that aligns with their cost.\nNakamichi\nNakamichi was founded in Japan by Etsuro Nakamichi in 1948. What started as a Research & Development firm would eventually become the sound giant Nakamichi that we know today. True to their R&D roots, Nakamichi has always innovated and pushed the envelope with its products. This philosophy has served the company well over the years, and helped it become one of the most respected producers of audio equipment in the industry.\nThe Nakamichi Dragon 11.4.6 surround sound system is a recent standout in its line of products. Digital Trends provided a comprehensive review of the system, examining its capabilities against the nearly $4,000 price tag. The conclusion was that while a similar system could potentially be assembled for less, the Nakamichi Dragon offers a unique combination of a clean design and advanced features in one package.\nThe influence of Nakamichi's R&D background is evident in the Dragon surround sound system. Notable as the world's first wireless 21-channel surround system, it combines powerful, wireless speakers with compatibility for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, showcasing Nakamichi's commitment to innovation in audio technology.\nSony\nWhen it comes to titans of consumer electronics, the last two entries on our list are in a league of their own. These brands have not just survived but thrived in a fast-paced industry, where innovation is key. They are the benchmarks of quality and longevity, making it a tough call to decide which one truly takes the crown.\nSony is a name that's virtually synonymous with cutting-edge consumer electronics, and has been at the forefront since 1946. Although the company's first product was a rice cooker, the Type-G tape recorder is what made Sony famous, helped secure its prominence, and set it on its path to becoming one of the world's best producers of audio equipment.\nSony is such a massive company, producing multiple tiers and ranges of products, that it sometimes ends up competing against itself with reviewers. For instance, the review site Rtings.com even has a comprehensive review that ranks the best Sony soundbars, since Sony's catalog is so varied. No matter what budget, room size, or level of professionalism needed in your system, Sony has a product line catered to you.\nSamsung\nToday we know Samsung as one of the world's leading manufacturers of commercial goods. However, in 1938, the fledgling Korean company traded in groceries. Founder Lee Byung-Chull would continue to add to Samsung's portfolio until they found the secret recipe with the Samsung Electronics division in the 1960s. Since then, Samsung has focused its efforts on home and consumer electronics, making it one of the world's most popular brands and a household name.\nThe Q-Series surround sound system is Samsung's latest foray into home audio. Earning spots on numerous \"top\" lists, the Q-Series is acknowledged for its advanced features. The system's soundbar is designed to automatically adjust its settings to suit the acoustics of the room, enhancing the viewing experience. Additionally, the system's rear speakers are equipped with upward-facing speakers to amplify sound coverage, creating a fuller surround sound experience.\nSince Samsung produces so many different types of electronics, it's no surprise that it also has its own line of smart TVs that sync up with Samsung sound systems. The Q-Series surround sound system syncs up to Samsung TVs with a system called Q Symphony. This feature was noted by PCMag for its ability to wirelessly sync with newer Samsung TVs for easy setup, while automatically using the TV's built-in speakers to supplement the Q-Series sound system."

      "text": "DTS:X Vs Dolby Atmos: The Two Top Surround Sound Technologies Explained\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nIf you've been looking into building a new home theater system and haven't looked into the topic in the last decade or so, then you've probably been hit by some new terminology that you weren't previously familiar with. The old-school front speakers, center speaker, surround speakers, and subwoofers have been joined by height-level speakers, which are either positioned in/on your ceiling or in upward-firing enclosures that bounce the sounds off the ceiling to make it sound like effects are coming from over your head.\nWith these changes came new surround sound formats from the leaders in the field, Dolby and DTS. Dolby came first with Dolby Atmos, while DTS soon followed with DTS:X. The two companies have been rivals for decades and have always argued over which had the better technology. The spatial audio era is no different, with DTS pledging that it has a more flexible and user-friendly format. So hewre are the key differences between DTS:X and Dolby Atmos.\nWhat is surround sound?\nPut simply, surround sound uses multiple speakers placed strategically around the viewing/listening area to create a more three-dimensional sound design for a given movie, TV show, video game, or music album. The first commercially popular surround sound format was Quadraphonic sound for music in the 1970s, with two front and two read channels. There was a not-insignificant amount of titles released on vinyl with Quadraphonic encoding, but it fizzled out before consumers could widely adopt it.\nThe technology spread to film, with Dolby Labs taking center stage with its Dolby Stereo technology that could extract surround sound information from what, on the surface, seemed like a simple two-channel stereo audio track. (If that sounds familiar, it may be because it's very similar to the Dolby ProLogic encoding that's still in AV receivers today.) In time, the standard configurations would take shape: 5.1 channel surround sound, meaning two front speakers in the traditional stereo positions, a center speaker for dialogue, two rear speakers, and a subwoofer for low-frequency effects. In time, that would expand to 7.2 channels, with the surround channels being split off into two side channels and two rear channels, plus an additional optional subwoofer.\nMost recently, technologies like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X added a new dimension: Height-level or overhead-firing channels. Those are represented by a third number: a 7.1 setup where the front left and right speakers also have upward-firing drivers would be 7.2.2 channel surround sound.\nAudio codecs explained\nIn the digital realm, audio data is defined by codecs, the type of software that handles both the encoding and decoding of a given audio stream (or video stream or still image). Speaking broadly, audio codecs use two different types of compression, lossless and lossy. Lossless codecs compress files by throwing out redundant data and nothing more, meaning that the original, uncompressed file should be able to be reconstructed from a losslessly compressed one. In that sense, it's like a ZIP or RAR file, just optimized for audio. Lossy compression, meanwhile, works completely differently, using psychoacoustic modeling to throw out audio that, in theory, the human ear should not notice. In practice, it doesn't always work that way, but it's still very smart technology.\nIf the average person has any idea of these concepts, it's probably through music downloads and streaming, where MP3 and AAC are the most popular lossy codecs, while FLAC and Apple Lossless are the most popular lossless ones. The same basic concepts also apply to home theater audio tracks, though. On DVD, the most common audio codec was Dolby's lossy AC-3, also known in the past as Dolby Digital. (The latter name now refers to Dolby's full suite of codecs.) On some discs, it was joined by a track from rival DTS using the lossy DTS Coherent Acoustics (commonly \"DTS\") codec, which was encoded at a higher data rate. In the transition from DVD to Blu-Ray, these were joined by lossless codecs from both companies: Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio.\nThe original Dolby Digital vs. DTS war\nWhen it comes to the lossless, Blu-Ray era codecs, there's no difference between Dolby and DTS's offerings because they're both lossless. As lossless codecs, they're always going to sound exactly the same. The only difference between lossless codecs comes in how efficiently they reduce file size.\nWith lossy codecs, it's a lot more subjective. DTS had its backers on the basis that the higher bitrate made it superior to AC-3, but there was a question as to whether AC-3 was more efficient. \"The engineers who wrote the compression algorithm [sic] for each format also used somewhat different, and somewhat subjective, criteria in deciding what parts of the original signal could be eliminated to save bits without sacrificing sound quality,\" wrote Ian G. Masters in the May 2005 issue of Sound & Vision. He added that DTS and AC-3 versions of a given soundtrack \"have been known to vary in their apparent frequency and channel balance,\" as well.\nComplicating matters in the DVD era was that AC-3 was supported on all hardware, like basic DVD players or \"home theater in a box\" systems, while DTS support was more limited. In its 2006 Annual Buying Guide, Consumer Reports stressed that consumers should look for AV receivers that supported both codecs, something that would soon turn into the default for that kind of hardware. By Blu-Ray, this would stop mattering much to the consumer, as all players fully supported the DTS suite of codecs.\nSo what are the differences between Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, the two newest technologies?\nThe differences between Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, the brand names for the revisions that include height level/overhead-firing speakers for spatial audio, are where things get particularly confusing. That's because unlike the previous generations of digital audio from both companies, they're not different flavors of the same thing, even if they might commonly be described as such. Specifically: DTS:X is DTS's latest codec and it allows for spatial audio configurations, while Dolby Atmos is explicitly not a codec. Instead, Atmos describes the audio stream data and the accompanying instructions telling your hardware how to output each channel.\nThis means that even though they're spoken about as competing formats, and on some level, they are, DTS:X and Dolby Atmos are two drastically different things. A DTS:X track delivers data encoded using the DTS:X codec, while a Dolby Atmos track is encoded using Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital Plus/Enhanced AC-3/EAC-3 (which had been used primarily for digital TV and online streaming audio tracks), and Dolby MAT, which is used to deliver TrueHD over HDMI.\nWhere this gets really interesting is that while Dolby Atmos requires upward-firing speakers to get spatial audio, DTS claimsin its original DTS:X press release, that DTS:X can accomplish spatial audio using speakers in \"a hemispherical layout based around the listening position in the room.\" Audio tracks could be \"remapped\" for different speaker layouts, making DTS:X more flexible, especially for those unwilling or unable to upgrade their systems to add upward-firing speakers.\nWhich is better, Dolby Atmos or DTS:X?\n\"Better\" is subjective, but the biggest advantage is probably one belonging to DTS:X. Dolby Atmos. In DTS:X, instead of being broken down into tracks required to have specific positions, everything is broken down into specific objects that can be adjusted individually.\n\"With spatial remapping with dialogue control, for example, if you are watching a sporting event and want to hear the announcers better, you will be able to adjust the volume of the announcers, as they will be rendered as objects,\" explained DTS's Dave Casey when asked about DTS:X's differences from Dolby Atmos in a July 2015 interview for Sound & Vision. \"Or, if you are watching an action movie with a lot of explosions or cars racing through the streets and want to hear the actors' dialogue more clearly, you will be able to adjust the dialogue.\"\nCasey conceded that the \"inclusion of height speakers will best replicate the immersive experience,\" but stressed that they weren't required.\nMeanwhile, one advantage for Dolby Atmos is simply that a lot more content is encoded in that format, especially on streaming services and in video games, with DTS:X generally appearing on Blu-ray Discs. Atmos also supports configurations with twice as many total speakers, 64 instead of 32, but most people won't come close to using even the smaller number of speakers. Realistically, though, any new receiver you buy will support both, and knowing the differences between the two formats is all you need."

      "text": "12 Major Soundbar Brands Ranked Worst To Best\nFlat-screen TVs are, on the whole, a giant leap forward in home entertainment. We no longer have to give up much of our living space to accommodate an unsightly, boxy appliance that commands attention in any room. Yet when it came to space-saving, attractive televisions, a significant compromise had to be made for sound quality, and this is where the soundbar comes in.\nAccurate sound reproduction demands the acoustic properties of more prominent speakers, and, for the most part, the slimline cones in flat-screen units don't cut it. The soundbar is an essential addition to any home theater setup, and it provides better audio clarity across a broader frequency spectrum, especially when combined with an accompanying subwoofer.\nHere, we take a deep dive into the biggest soundbar brands and how they compare according to their products' sound quality, value for money, features, and functionality. In this instance, it is necessary to consider a wide range of models to suit different consumer budgets, requirements, and technical elements, such as frequency responses, audio processing, mobile connectivity, and the materials used in their construction. Let's jump right in.\n12. LG\nSouth Korea is famous for many things, including its fried chicken, soju liquor, pop music, and consumer electronics companies. LG is one such company that produces affordable yet high-quality soundbars. While its systems couldn't be described as audiophile-quality, they significantly upgrade any flat-panel TV for those who don't wish to spend a small fortune.\nIts soundbar products include Google Assistant functionality, wireless subwoofers, HDMI ARC connectivity, and various audio channels such as 3.1, 5.1, and 7.1 surround sound. They are also compatible with the excellent LG Magic Remote line of control units, some of the most intuitive and versatile with their voice recognition technology and gesture commands.\nIn short, while it is by no means the best soundbar manufacturer, the fact that it made this ranking places LG among the top brands, and with models such as the LG P9YA offering 5.1 surround-sound, and Dolby Atmos compatibility for under $300, it is one of the best budget options going.\n11. Yamaha\nFirst and foremost, it is worth mentioning that Yamaha invented the \"digital sound projector,\" the YSP-1 soundbar, which brought us the first authentic 5.1 surround sound. So it's with little surprise that the Japanese giant known for its wide variety of products, encompassing the musical instrument, automotive, and pro audio sectors, gets a nod here.\nYamaha soundbars are recognizable for their unique curvy styling. They are also among the most affordable in this ranking, with their modestly-priced YAS-209 costing as little as $230, including a subwoofer and Alexa voice control functionality. While this unit will not provide a fully-immersive sound like more expensive units, it is a small price to pay for a vast improvement on your television's built-in audio.\nYet for a few dollars more at $250, you can opt for the versatile and compact SR-C30A with Bluetooth connectivity, Yamaha's Adaptive Low Volume and Clear Voice sound enhancement features, and a wireless subwoofer. While it won't be getting much love from audiophile publications this year, Yamaha is still a key player within the soundbar category. This brand demands some attention from buyers shopping on a budget.\n10. Samsung\nThis ubiquitous South Korean brand needs no introduction, and its extensive catalog of soundbars ranges from a few hundred dollars to almost two thousand for its flagship Q990C unit. When synced with a Samsung TV, they can provide an immersive experience, thanks to front, side, and up-firing speakers, which blend with the TV's sound using the new Q Symphony feature.\nKey features that many Samsung soundbars offer include advanced audio technologies, such as DTS:X and Dolby Atmos spatial audio processing, as well as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. They can be configured via the Samsung SmartThings app for convenience. It's worth remembering that soundbars can be used as standalone Bluetooth speakers for mobile devices, so connectivity is undoubtedly something that should be a consideration, especially if you like to stream music and podcasts around the house without going into your TV's menu or signing into your accounts there.\nUnfortunately, some features of Samsung soundbars, such as the \"Tap Sound\" activation function, only work if you have a Samsung phone, but this is more of a novelty than a requirement. All in all, Samsung delivers a quality line of products, including slimline soundbars, all-in-one soundbars, and premium soundbars. If you have a Samsung TV, it might be the best option for compatibility alone.\n9. Sony\nAs another brand that offers a wide range of models to suit all budgets, Sony soundbars represent excellent value for money. Its flagship products deliver crisp audio across a broad frequency spectrum with exceptional clarity. Still, it also has basic offerings that are perfectly acceptable to boost your TV's existing sound quality. As with Samsung, you can expect a reassuring build quality from Sony as it designs its gear to last and offers many features and functions to suit all home entertainment configurations.\nSony makes soundbar systems with 2.1, 3.1, 5.1, and 7.1 channel options (the .1 refers to a low-frequency channel \u2013 usually an external subwoofer). Generally speaking, the more channels you have, the richer the sound. However, certain factors like room size and speaker placement are essential for achieving the optimal sonic experience. 5.1 surround sound is the most commonly used configuration for home cinema setups. For most people, this is more than fit for purpose, with 7.1 systems usually reserved for those looking for detailed depth and clarity that encompasses distances and directions.\nAdditionally, Sony offers a range of sound technologies within its soundbars, including 360 Reality Audio, 360 Spatial Sound Mapping, Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, Sound Field Optimization, and Vertical/Front Surround. From the options available, we can clearly see that much research and development has gone into how Sony's soundbars achieve their excellent sound reproduction.\n8. Denon\nDenon has been a big name among hi-fi enthusiasts for decades, so it makes sense that they branched out into home cinema systems. It currently makes some of the best value-for-money soundbars in various sizes to suit your home theater setup. They are among the most versatile, with some models supporting Dolby Atmos 3D spatial audio and a range of voice commands and input/output options.\nWith its history rooted in home audio systems, it's no surprise that Denon focuses on audio streaming for its soundbar range. This is apparent from the inclusion of HEOS Built-In technology on its flagship Sound Bar 550 model, which syncs with smart devices to provide direct high-resolution audio streaming. There is also a HEOS companion app to make life easier for you when configuring and controlling your soundbar. Additionally, much of the range has Alexa voice command functionality to switch volume, EQ levels, and even input sources without lifting a finger.\nDenon's soundbar range is limited, with five options and just two that include wireless subwoofers, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. For example, the compact DHT-S217 has Dolby Atmos and built-in subwoofers for under $250, making it ideal for those looking to streamline their home theater setup without compromising sound quality.\n7. JBL\nJBL is a pioneering firm that has lately made great waves in the home audio industry, established over 75 years ago. Known for its professional-level products, the company created music production speakers, Cinema systems, DJ gear, PA systems, and in-car audio.\nJBL offers an extensive range of soundbars that are well-designed with valuable features. Its top-of-the-range BAR 1300 model boasts impressive 11.1.4 surround capabilities with Dolby Atmos and innovative detachable wireless satellite speakers. These internal batteries charge from the central soundbar unit and can be placed behind the viewer to achieve the system's fully-immersive potential. It also has multiple connectivity options, with AirPlay, Alexa MRM, and Chromecast built-in. The detachable units can also be used as independent wireless speakers or paired for stereo sound when used independently.\nSuch innovation and remarkable functionality make JBL stand out among its peers in the soundbar sector. The sheer amount of choice makes it hard not to consider JBL an option when shopping for a soundbar setup. While JBL soundbars are a little more expensive than similar-spec alternatives, you can pick up the entry-level BAR Studio 2.0 for as little as $140.\n6. Bose\nBose has long been an innovator in all things audio and is known for its small-scale products that provide big sound. This innovation extends to its soundbar sector, with smart models offering cinema-quality sound without an additional subwoofer. This brand focuses on quality over quantity, with a small but wide-ranging product line that caters to most home theater requirements.\nAt the entry-level end of the range is its succinctly-named Bose TV Speaker. For $279, this does exactly as you'd expect by boosting your TV's audio performance with a compact Roku-ready soundbar with its own remote and Bluetooth connectivity. Going further up the ranking are models such as the Smart Soundbar 600, which has Dolby Atmos and Alexa voice command functionality. While these models are known to produce a satisfying bass response, Bose does give you the option to buy its Bass Module woofer and satellite speakers as extras.\nOr you can spend $2,347 on the Bose Premium Home Theater system, complete with the nine-speaker Smart Soundbar 900, Bass Module 700, and Surround Speakers 700. While this impressive system has all the voice command functionality, Dolby Atmos 360-degree sound, and connectivity options that you'd expect from a flagship model from a premium brand, its fit and finish capture the eye, with the use of glass and Bose's OmniJewel surface making this plush bundle stand out from the rather monolithic crowd.\n5. Sonos\nSonos is one of the original trailblazers in wireless home entertainment. Its smart soundbars are just a part of the Sonos experience. Multiple speakers around the home are connected via the companion app to provide a truly immersive sonic experience wherever you happen to be. Sonos soundbars are available in three models, starting with the entry-level Sonos Ray, then the midrange Sonos Beam (Gen 2), with the top-of-the-range Sonos Arc completing the set.\nWhile each soundbar that Sonos creates represents excellent build quality and exceptional sound, the midrange Beam (Gen 2) is making waves in hi-fi circles as one of the most impressive systems the brand has produced and one of the best-quality soundbars for the money. Retailing at just under $500, this compact Dolby-Atmos-equipped soundbar has five speaker arrays that combine to deliver theater-quality surround sound in a compact chassis that won't clutter your television stand. As with all Sonos products, it integrates into your wireless multi-room setup, but even as a standalone unit, it is an excellent product. However, it does lack DTS:X, meaning it requires satellite speakers to shine.\nOther offerings to augment your sound include the third-generation Sonos Sub subwoofer that bottoms out at 25 Hz and multiple packages, such as the Surround Set, Entertainment Set, and Immersive Set, each with different satellite speakers and subwoofer configurations. If you are keen on a house-wide network of wireless sound systems, then Sonos is likely the solution you are looking for, provided it suits your budget.\n4. Klipsch\nWhile Klipsch soundbars may look similar, with two horns bookending a long mesh grille, they each have different features to suit various audio solutions. This company uses some of the best materials, such as fiber composite woofers and hand-finished exotic woods, to bring you an artisan product that looks as good as it sounds. Yet, many have not even heard of this premium brand founded in Arkansas back in 1946.\nThe idea behind the Klipsch Cinema 600 was to take the ideology that informed its high-end reference speakers and apply it to its soundbars, which is a good starting point. The result is a 5.1 surround sound system that is intuitive and powerful. You can control its multiple settings via the Klipsch Connect app, which includes six speaker presets, so you are out of the gate straight away.\nKlipsch provides few frills in its product line. Their entire range only extends to 5.1 surround with Dolby Atmos on its more premium models, but a more modest product, when made well, can best even the most technical offerings from the best-known brands, and this is where Klipsch has succeeded.\n3. Vizio\nCalifornia-based Vizio designs some of the most visually appealing soundbars, provided you are a fan of the color black. It also has one of the most impressive ranges of soundbars available right now; they sound great and are competitively priced, leaving us wondering whether there's a catch.\nOne of the latest additions to the Vizio Soundbar Catalog is its M-Series AiO model, which, with its trapezoidal profile and fabric grille, is undoubtedly a thing of beauty, with buttons that are concealed well out of the way at the side and a 2.13-inch height that will enable it to slide effortlessly under most TV stands. However, despite its advertised DTS:X decoding, the AiO falls a little short in the 3D sound department. It does, however, include onboard \"subwoofers\" that, while not as effective as the real thing, add enough bottom end to embellish your viewing experience far beyond the capabilities of a regular TV's speakers.\nIf you want to go the full distance, Vizio has enough in its range to satisfy the most ardent audiophile, from compact soundbars to complete home theater and immersive bundles that leave little to be desired. In summary, anyone serious about home entertainment should have Vizio on their list of considerations for their ultimate in-house setup.\n2. Sennheiser\nSennheiser has long been a significant player in the pro-audio industry. Its soundbars live up to this well-earned reputation, provided you are prepared to pay pro-audio prices. But this ranking is for the best soundbars, not the best-priced, and, as is often the case, German engineering shines as being among the best products within any given category.\nOne such product that is more than worthy of mention is Sennheiser's Ambeo Soundbar | Max, which likely produces the biggest sound for a standalone soundbar available today. Most notably, it offers bass frequencies as low as 30Hz from its integrated subwoofer, so if floor space is a point for consideration, this slimline all-in-one solution could be just what you're looking for.\nWhile it is compatible with Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and MPEG-H audio processing, the Ambeo utilizes its own Upmix Technology to convert any stereo or 5.1 audio into 3D sound. In addition, its Advanced Room Calibration tailors sound to your living space, giving you a bespoke experience that is hard to beat in home theater terms, making Sennheiser among the most innovative and progressive brands currently producing soundbars.\n1. Polk Audio\nWhile it may not be the most well-known brand in this ranking, the Polk Audio company is focused purely on speakers. Its product line extends to home speakers, built-in speakers, outdoor speakers, and car and marine speakers, plus they make excellent, reasonably-priced soundbars. From its more affordable Signa range to its premium Magnifi line of soundbars, there is something here to satisfy everyone and every budget.\nPolk's flagship Magnifi Max AX SR bundle features everything that a premium soundbar should, including DTS:X and Dolby Atmos processing and Polk's patented SDA technology to deliver near-perfect sound reproduction in glorious 7.1 surround. It features an 11-speaker array to ensure that no syllable is clipped and every frequency, from deep bass to the highest registers, is accounted for.\nYet you don't have to spend a fortune to purchase one of Polk's top-tier products, with models like the Signa S4D delivering Dolby Atmos 3D sound for as little as $279. Polk Audio's comprehensive and affordable range allows buyers to own a high-quality home theater setup without having to delve too deep into their pockets or feel obliged to opt for audio quality that is surplus to their requirements. After all, most people will settle for anything notably better than their current TV speakers, and Polk's soundbar products go far above and beyond this."
