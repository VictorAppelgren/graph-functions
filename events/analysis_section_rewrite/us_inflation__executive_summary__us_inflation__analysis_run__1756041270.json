      "feedback": "The draft is informative but overly sprawling and source-heavy; it needs a crisp, executable house view (4–6 sentences or bullets) with a single, coherent causal chain and explicit, source-backed numerics. Actionable edits: compress to 4–6 executive lines that state a base-case Regime A (long-horizon, regime-based) with clear anchors (demographics/health costs, persistent inflation/real rates, saving/income policy frictions) and concrete beneficiaries (UNH, MSFT, SHOP) plus explicit metrics (e.g., UNH free‑cash‑flow yield >9%; near-term dividend ~3%; SWR floor 3.7%; 1–1.5% annual AI productivity uplift). Build a tight causal chain: anchors → pricing → multiples → valuations, and ensure every assertion ties to a cited source ID; reconcile conflicting debt figures (e.g., 4T vs 4.4T vs 2.4T) by selecting a single base assumption or presenting clearly labeled alternatives. Define explicit scenario structure (Base Case, Alt 1, Alt 2) with time-bound triggers and invalidation rules (e.g., policy offsets fail by day 60; debt/GDP breaches a defined corridor; HeartSciences milestones slip), and attach concrete thresholds to each watch item (tariff pass-through, CPI/PCE autos components, AI milestones, HeartSciences FDA/Medicare timelines, Pacaso/mogul fundraising velocity, UAS data revisions). Replace broad narrative with quantified near-term paths: 0–3 weeks autos pricing pass-through to CPI/PCE autos components; consumer credit/SoFi-Upstart APR ranges as inputs to lending-cost sensitivity; ensure all numeric claims are sourced from IDs present in SOURCE MATERIAL and avoid non-listed references. Tighten near-term momentum sections (Shopify/MSFT cloud/AI trajectory, tariff/oil inputs) into a single, testable outline with 2–3 sharp catalysts and 2–3 concrete risks, and conclude with a concise, executive verdict and a moderate confidence tag tied to the cited sources.",
