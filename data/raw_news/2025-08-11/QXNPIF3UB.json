  "description": "Key PointsArtificial intelligence (AI) is driving demand for Amazon's cloud services.",
  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None The company's digital advertising has become the company's fastest-growing segment.\n\u2022 None Even Wall Street's modest growth targets will earn Amazon a spot among the tech elite in short order.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Amazon \u203a\n\nThe primary growth drivers of the U.S. economy have shifted in recent decades. Twenty years ago, the largest companies in the land hailed from the oil and industrial industries. For example, in 2005, the largest companies in the U.S., measured by market cap, were ExxonMobil and General Electric, worth $392 billion and $375 billion, respectively. Now, two decades later, technology enterprises, particularly those involved in artificial intelligence (AI), are at the top of the charts.\n\nThree of the world's most recognizable companies are at the forefront. AI chipmaker Nvidia leads the field at $4.3 trillion, within striking distance of a new all-time high. Software and cloud purveyor Microsoft also appears poised to climb to new heights, recently climbing to $3.9 trillion. Rounding out this tech trifecta is iPhone maker Apple at $3.1 trillion.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nWith a market cap of $2.3 trillion, it might seem a bit premature to predict Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) admission. After all, fair-weather investors have fled, and the stock is flat so far this year, weighed down by tariff-related uncertainty. However, other segments of Amazon's business appear poised to spark a renaissance in the company's growth, securing its membership in the $3 trillion club.\n\nThe Trump administration's tariff policies remain in flux, and the resulting uncertainty is weighing on Amazon's stock. That's easy to understand, as third-party merchants generate roughly 62% of unit sales, and many of these goods are sourced from China. A recent deal set a minimum levy of 30% on Chinese imports, while some products are saddled with a higher rate. The recent trade agreement notwithstanding, investors are wary of the ongoing impact on Amazon's e-commerce sales.\n\nResults from the second quarter and Amazon's forecast seemed to confirm their worst fears. Overall net sales increased 13% year over year to $167.7 billion, with 61% of its revenue from digital sales or third-party seller services. The company's third-quarter outlook is telling. While Amazon is forecasting revenue growth of 11.5% at the midpoint of its guidance, it expects operating income to be essentially flat, in no small part thanks to tariffs.\n\nThe good news is that its cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), won't be directly affected by tariffs. For context, AWS generated 19% of Amazon's revenue and 58% of operating income so far this year, helping insulate the company somewhat from tariffs.\n\nFurthermore, AWS is the worldwide leader in cloud infrastructure services, with a market share of 32% in Q1, according to market analyst Canalys. Furthermore, the segment is growing at a respectable pace, with sales of $31 billion representing a roughly 18% increase.\n\nGrowth has reaccelerated over the past year, driven by rising demand for AI. In June, CEO Andy Jassy pulled back the curtain, revealing that Amazon had more than 1,000 generative AI services and apps in development or already built, and the company plans to create many more. \"AI will be a substantial catalyst,\" Jassy said.\n\nAmazon's cloud customers represent a captive audience and target market for its AI products and services, which will be a catalyst for future growth.\n\nAnother area fueling Amazon's growth is advertising, which is by far the company's fastest-growing segment. Ad revenue grew 23% year over year to $15.7 billion in Q2, and now accounts for more than 9% of total revenue. Its growth has expanded beyond in-search advertising, driven by Amazon Prime, live sports programming, Fire TV, and Twitch -- the company's live-streaming gaming platform.\n\nAmazon also recently inked deals with Roku and Disney to drive future growth. The company now reaches more than 80% of connected TV (CTV) households in the U.S., significantly expanding the reach of its advertising.\n\nAmazon has a market cap of roughly $2.32 trillion as of this writing, so it will only take a stock price increase of about 29% to boost its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $708 billion in 2025, resulting in a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would need revenue of roughly $914 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nWall Street is currently forecasting Amazon's growth to be roughly 10% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that target, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2028. That might well be conservative, as Amazon has grown its annual revenue by 561% over the past decade, and by 13% in the most recent quarter, fueled by demand for cloud and AI services.\n\nFurthermore, at 33 times earnings, Amazon trades at a slight premium compared with a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500 -- yet has generated stock price gains of 719% over the past 10 years, far exceeding the S&P 500, which rose just 202%. This makes a compelling case that Amazon stock is attractive at this price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $653,427!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,119,863!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,060% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.

      "text": "What is it?\nWhat is the price-to-sales ratio?\nThe price-to-sales ratio, also known as \"price/sales,\" \"P/S ratio,\" or \"list-price-to-sale-price ratio,\" is one of many valuation metrics for stocks. The ratio describes how much someone must pay to buy one share of a company relative to how much that share generates in revenue for the company. Generally speaking, the lower the P/S ratio, the better.\nFormula\nPrice-to-sales ratio formula\nYou determine the P/S ratio by dividing the company's total market capitalization by its trailing 12-month revenue:\nThat means the P/S ratio is based solely on revenue, not on profits or cash flow. As a result, it's especially useful for comparing the valuations of companies with little or no profit or negative cash flow.\nCash Flow\nAmazon (AMZN -0.7%), for example, is notorious for having been unprofitable until 2003, seven years after it went public. On Jan. 1, 2003, Amazon's market capitalization (the sum of the price of all its outstanding shares) was $7.3 billion. Its trailing 12-month revenue was $3.9 billion. Divide $7.3 billion by $3.9 billion and you get about 1.8, which was Amazon's P/S ratio at the time.\nExample\nAn example of price-to-sales ratio analysis\nBy using the P/S ratio, we can compare Amazon's valuation on Jan. 1, 2003, with its performance leading up to that point:\nDue largely to how quickly Amazon was increasing its revenue, its price-to-sales ratio fell from a high of about 40 to 1.8. As a result, Amazon looks like a comparative bargain in 2003. (And it was: The stock has appreciated more than 22,000% since then.)\nComparing companies\nThe price-to-sales ratio can also be used for comparing companies -- including unprofitable companies -- against one another. Here, for example, is a comparison of two cloud-computing solution stocks, Snowflake (SNOW -0.22%) and Datadog (DDOG -1.7%).\nSnowflake's price-to-sales ratio is significantly higher than Datadog's. From a P/S ratio point of view, that makes Snowflake a more expensive stock. But that doesn't mean it's a worse investment. Snowflake could be worth the premium price because it's accruing revenue faster than Datadog. Remember, Amazon made a great investment in the early 2000s despite its sky-high P/S ratio because it was adding revenue at such a rapid clip.\nThe P/S ratio is a good starting point to compare two companies' stock, but investors should dive deeper to understand whether one stock is a better buy than the other.\nAdditional information\nWhat is a good price-to-sales ratio?\nIt depends on the company and the industry.\nGrocery stores, for example, have massive amounts of sales but relatively low profit margins, so it's not unusual for grocery store stocks to see P/S ratios of 0.2 or even 0.1. A higher-margin company could have a much higher P/S ratio and still be considered a bargain. Amazon's P/S ratio, for example, has ranged between 2 and 6 for the past five years.\nBecause P/S ratio is a rear-facing metric that looks only at past performance, fast-growing companies such as Snowflake or Datadog can easily see massive P/S ratios as investors bid up the price in expectation of future sales growth.\nYour best bet when looking at a company's P/S ratio is to compare it with the P/S ratios of similar companies in the same industry.\nOne piece of the puzzle\nThe price-to-sales ratio is a useful tool for evaluating companies, especially those with negative earnings or cash flow that can't be measured through the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. But the P/S ratio isn't very useful on its own.\nFor example, if one company has a low P/S ratio but an unreasonably high debt load, it isn't necessarily a good value. A company's growth rate, profit margins, and competitive advantages should also be considered. Snowflake's P/S ratio might be much higher than Datadog's, but Snowflake also has no debt, is growing faster, and has a higher gross profit margin.\nInvesting decisions should never be made on the basis of a single metric, and the P/S ratio is no exception.\nRelated investing topics\nGoing beyond the P/S ratio\nCalculating the price-to-sales ratio for any given stock is very easy. Just divide the market cap by the company's total revenue. One of the best ways to use the P/S ratio is by comparing it to a stock's historical average. Alternatively, you can use it to compare the valuations of two companies' stocks to help determine which is a better fit for your portfolio. Ultimately, however, you should dig deeper for context around why the market may be trading a stock at a certain P/S ratio to make the best investment decisions possible."

      "text": "You have probably heard the term \"generative AI\" tossed around in tech circles or investment discussions. It's one of those buzzwords that seems to be on everyone's lips nowadays, starting when OpenAI released the ChatGPT tool in November 2022. But the name alone doesn't really explain what's going on, and there are many ways to look at this interesting toolkit. So, it's time to demystify this tech jargon.\nWhat is generative AI?\nWhat is generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) where computer systems create new content. It's like a digital Picasso, Shakespeare, or Mozart, generating complete works of creative text, images, music, or even entire virtual worlds.\nThis is the secret sauce behind those eerily realistic images and even videos you see online nowadays. These tools can be quite powerful, but they are not digital magic -- the quality of an AI-generated creative artifact rarely matches the quality of a competent human creator. The AI systems must be trained with the help of creative works created by humans -- adding several ethical and practical wrinkles to computerized semi-creativity.\nWhy should I care?\nWhy should I care about generative AI?\nImagine a world where AI can write a best-selling novel, design a skyscraper, or even create a blockbuster movie. In the long run, that's the potential of generative AI. It's not just about creating content; it's about pushing the boundaries of creativity and innovation. These are the long-term goals of generative AI systems. They have a long way to go before becoming truly creative, and the resulting content often comes with obvious flaws. Still, the AI industry is taking giant steps in this direction.\nGenerative AI is also a potential game-changer for businesses. It can automate content creation and personalize user experiences. With this tool in your pocket, you can create good-looking marketing campaigns from scratch, complete with AI-written text and computer-generated images. Text and images used in conversation-style customer interactions don't always have to be perfect, making today's generative AI efforts good enough for many practical purposes.\nBut like any powerful tool, generative AI has its dark side. It can be used to spread misinformation, create deepfakes, or even commit fraud. It's a double-edged sword that nobody knows exactly how to handle yet. The companies behind high-powered generative AI systems must balance unfettered creative ability against the legal and ethical ramifications of doing the job too well.\nFurthermore, the AI systems are trained with reference to existing works of art, literature, music, architecture, and so forth. It's not always clear how much of the credit for an AI-generated piece belongs to the system and how much is a direct copy of a human artist's original work. Many human content creators don't want computers to rely on their creative works to train their systems and sometimes simply copy the originals.\nAnd the computers still need a fair bit of human hand-holding. The auto-generated output is only as good as the human instinct and analysis that went into the text-based instructions and other inputs. Generative AI content can't compare to the art and craft of human creators yet, and it usually must be reviewed by editors before being used for business purposes.\nThe robots can provide assistance to creative processes or deliver good-enough quick takes. But they're not writing the next great American novel or composing brilliant symphonies.\nCompanies involved with AI\nCompanies involved with generative AI\nAs an investor, you can benefit from generative AI in several ways.\nThe most obvious method is to invest directly in businesses that run generative AI services, such as Adobe (ADBE -2.25%) or Microsoft (MSFT -0.16%). The hardware that makes it possible is another simple option, including AI accelerator specialist Nvidia (NVDA -0.44%) and computer memory maker Micron Technology (MU 4.12%).\nBut you have other options. Companies that leverage generative AI technology to run or enhance their existing business may have a competitive edge, and investing in them could yield significant returns as the market develops. Clear examples of this would include voice command systems developer SoundHound AI (SOUN 17.49%) and media-streaming pioneer Netflix (NFLX 0.57%). SoundHound AI relies on ChatGPT to manage conversations with human customers, while Netflix leverages image and video generators as a production tool.\nConsumers can already enjoy the fruits of generative AI. From personalized recommendations to AI-generated art, this technology can enrich your life in countless ways. But be aware of the potential pitfalls. Always question the source of the information and be critical of what you consume.\nHow generative AI is used\nHow generative AI is used\nSome of the best generative AI systems out there combine the language-processing smarts of a chatbot with powerful image-generation tools.\nThe early leaders in this particular field include OpenAI's DALL-E 3, Adobe's Firefly, the independently developed Midjourney, and the self-funded Leonardo.AI. Each platform has its own benefits, downsides, and quirks, but all can turn plain text instructions into stunning images in just a few seconds.\nRelated investing topics\nLimitations\nLimitations\nHowever, designing the instructions in plain old English is arguably an art form in itself. Computers can't read your mind, and even extremely detailed instructions probably won't generate exactly what you visualize.\nOther issues crop up with generative AI productions, too. Before using generative AI tools for business purposes, you'll need to consider many legal, moral, practical, and ethical problems first. In the end, the computers aren't actually creative and you should consider the makers of the underlying training materials. Companies like IBM (IBM -2.6%) specialize in providing generative AI tools with clear audit trails and specific source materials. Enterprise-class AI users crave that legal clarity."

Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Shorthand for \"market capitalization,\" market cap is one way an investor can evaluate how much a company is worth. Market cap refers to the total value of a publicly traded company's shares.\nTo determine a company's market cap, simply multiply the share price by the number of shares outstanding.\nAn example of market capitalization\nAn example of market capitalization\nHere's Costco Wholesale (COST 0.79%) as an example. At recent prices, Costco shares sell for $900, with around 450 million shares outstanding. In this case, $900 times 450 million equals a $400 billion market cap.\nBut why is market cap important and how should you use it? It's one of the best measures of a publicly traded company's size, which can tell you a lot about what to expect if you buy its stock.\n- Large companies tend to have more stable and mature businesses, having proven themselves over time and weathered difficult business conditions to emerge stronger. However, the growth prospects for large companies can be limited because they've already taken advantage of their primary opportunities to grow to their current size.\n- Smaller companies often have more room to grow, but they are typically younger, with riskier business models that haven't yet proved themselves. Their odds of failure can be higher than those of larger companies, which presents added risk.\nHere's a quick breakdown of how market cap ranges are often segmented across companies of different sizes:\n| Type of Stock | Market Capitalization Range |\n|---|---|\n| Mega cap | More than $200 billion |\n| Large cap | $10 billion to $200 billion |\n| Mid cap | $2 billion to $10 billion |\n| Small cap | $300 million to $2 billion |\n| Micro cap | $50 million to $300 million |\nIn general, investors look at the market in the following three categories most often since these are the market cap categories most stocks tend to fall into.\nWhat are large-cap stocks?\nWhat are large-cap stocks?\nLarge-cap stocks have market caps of more than $10 billion. Most of the best-known companies in the world are large caps, and these are typically the companies that have established themselves as the leaders in their industries. While many deal with the ups and downs of their industry's cycles, these are often the strongest companies and have proven capable of holding off competitive threats. Large caps are often where you'll find the best dividend stocks. These large companies often generate more cash than they need for the business and return that extra capital to investors in dividend payments.\nWhat are mid-cap stocks?\nWhat are mid-cap stocks?\nMid-cap stocks have market caps between $2 and $10 billion, occupying the middle ground between large and small companies. Mid-cap companies often have made considerable progress in building up successful business models, and that gives their investors some stability and protection against the future challenges smaller companies may face. Yet even with some track record, mid caps also may face the daunting task of beating out, or even disrupting, bigger and better-funded large-cap competitors to realize their own financial promise.\nNot all mid caps are growth stocks. They may be companies that operate in a smaller niche without big growth prospects, or they may be former large caps that have declined due to changes in the competitive landscape or (as with many brick-and-mortar retailers) some industry disruption.\nWhat are small-cap stocks?\nWhat are small-cap stocks?\nSmall-cap stocks are generally defined as having market caps between $300 million and $2 billion. Sometimes companies with market caps below $300 million are in this group, although most categorize those as micro-cap stocks. They are generally growth stocks or upstarts just getting their feet under them and looking to do something big. While small-cap stocks have historically delivered above-average returns as a group, many fail to live up to expectations. Small-cap stocks are more volatile than larger caps, meaning there is more risk of losses in the short term. These stocks are generally best owned as a diversified group, and for many years, in order to reduce those risks.\nDividends Per Share\nHow to use market cap\nHow to use market cap\nMarket cap is helpful when evaluating a company's size. But don't let the market value of a company cause you to dismiss large- or even mega-cap stocks as \"too big to buy.\" The global economy is enormous, serving more than 7 billion people and with a fast-growing middle class. A $10 billion company that serves a multi-trillion-dollar market can grow substantially.\nMoreover, companies can deliver strong per-share returns without expanding their market cap fast. Share repurchases that reduce the share count reward long-term investors with a bigger piece of the company, while dividends put money directly back into your pocket. These two things combined can significantly reduce how much market cap needs to grow for investors to get above-average returns.\nRelated investing topics\nConversely, companies -- often small caps that need the cash -- may sell stock to fund growth, pay debt, or just keep the lights on. When this happens, it reduces -- dilutes -- how much of the company each share is worth. For example, if a company with 10 million shares issues and sells 1 million new shares, 10% of your former equity now belongs to the new shareholders. The key here is to consider a company's history of share buybacks and dilution.\nMost investors find that having a diversified portfolio that includes stocks of various market caps is best. It lets you tailor for the desired return and risk levels that meet your goals. If you want your portfolio to be more stable, you'll want a bigger allocation of large-cap stocks. If your primary goal is to increase your portfolio's size as much possible over many years, you'll likely want to own more small- and mid-cap stocks."

Despite facing challenges from tariff-related uncertainties, Amazon's overall sales grew 13% to $167.7 billion, with a significant portion coming from third-party seller services. Analysts predict that if Amazon maintains a growth rate of around 10% annually, it could reach a $3 trillion market cap by 2028, bolstered by its leadership in cloud services and expanding AI capabilities.",
