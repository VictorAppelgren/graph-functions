  "content": "Mortgage borrowers are facing the \u201ctoughest burden\u201d since the 2008 financial crisis, analysis shows.\n\nA middle earner with an average mortgage has to spend nearly half of their gross salary on monthly repayments, according to data from Moneyfacts.\n\nThe figure hit a 16-year high of 49.1pc in June last year, and has since fallen slightly to 45.1pc.\n\nThe percentage of income spent on mortgage repayments hit a record-high of 53pc in June 2007, before interest rates were slashed to stimulate the economy, causing mortgage prices to fall.\n\nOver a decade of ultra-low borrowing costs and a lack of housing supply have helped house prices grow much more quickly than wages.\n\nThe rise in interest rates from 2022 has left many buyers caught between high house prices, expensive borrowing and stricter lending rules.\n\nIn January 2000, the average house price was \u00a378,000, around five times the average wage of \u00a315,800, Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry data show.\n\nToday, the average house price is \u00a3269,000, around seven times the average wage of \u00a337,600 \u00ad\u2013 well above standard lending caps.\n\nSince 2000, wages have risen by 237pc, while house prices have increased by 345pc. House price inflation has far outpaced the rise in most household goods during this time.\n\nIf wages had increased at the same rate as house prices since 2000, the average UK salary would be over \u00a354,000 today compared to the actual figure of just \u00a338,224.\n\nIt all means that a typical borrower today will need to take a mortgage over a 50-year term to keep their repayments to a more affordable 35pc of gross monthly income, according to Moneyfacts.\n\nTom Bill, of estate agents Knight Frank, said: \u201cAffordability has become a bigger concern for buyers and homeowners since rates began normalising in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe recent spike in bond yields, in part due to market jitters ahead of the autumn Budget, has only added to the financial pressure on households, irrespective of the fact the Bank of England has cut rates three times this year.\u201d\n\nThe average two-year fixed-rate mortgage fell below 5pc last month for the first time since Liz Truss\u2019s 2022 mini-Budget, signalling a \u201csymbolic turning point\u201d for homeowners, according to experts.\n\nThe rate was last below 5pc on September 29 2022, before the former prime minister announced \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts.\n\nThe Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee trimmed the UK\u2019s main benchmark interest rate from 4.25pc to 4pc last month. The committee will meet next on September 18.",

  "argos_summary": "Mortgage borrowers in the UK are now facing the toughest repayment burden since the 2008 crisis, with average borrowers spending nearly half of their gross salary on mortgage payments. The high cost of borrowing, driven by rising interest rates since 2022, has pushed the mortgage\u2011to\u2011income ratio to a 16\u2011year high of 49.1% in June, slightly down to 45.1% recently. House price inflation has outpaced wage growth, making homeownership increasingly unaffordable and forcing many to consider longer loan terms to keep repayments below 35% of income. The Bank of England\u2019s rate cuts have temporarily eased pressure, but the overall environment remains challenging for prospective homeowners.",
