  "description": "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints",
  "content": "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.\n\nThe judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The handcuffs will prevent Google from negotiating contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.\n\nBut Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.\n\nThe judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d\n\nPartially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.\n\nThe Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.\n\nIn its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d\n\nThe Mountain View, California, company has already vowed to appeal the judge\u2019s monopoly findings issued 13 months ago that led to Tuesday's ruling.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot,\u201d said Nidhi Hegde, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project.\n\nInvestors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged nearly 3% in extended trading. Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged nearly 3% in extended trading.\n\nAllowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.\n\nIn hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google\u2019s search engine anyway.\n\nOthers, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.\n\nMehta refrained from ordering a sale of Chrome because he decided there wasn't adequate proof the browser served as an essential ingredient in Google's search monopoly, making a divestiture \u201ca poor fit for this case.\u201d\n\nChrome would have been a hot commodity had the judge forced Google to put it on the auction block. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Chrome last month. And during court testimony earlier this year, a ChatGPT executive left no doubt that service\u2019s owner, OpenAI, would be interested in be interested in buying Chrome, too.\n\nBut the judge decided forcing Google to open up parts of its search data to rivals such as DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others will offer he best and fairest way to foster more compelling competition. In doing so, Mehta still narrowed the scope of the Justice Department's request and will limit the access to Google's search index and query histories.",

      "text": "Judge wrestles with far-reaching remedy proposals in US antitrust case against Google\nJudge wrestles with far-reaching remedy proposals in US antitrust case against Google\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The fate and fortunes of one of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies now sit in the hands of a U.S. judge wrestling with whether to impose far-reaching changes upon Google in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared an illegal monopoly.\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta heard closing arguments Friday from Justice Department lawyers who argued that a radical shake-up is needed to promote a free and fair market. Their proposed remedies include a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser.\nGoogle\u2019s legal team argued that only minor concessions are needed and urged Mehta not to unduly punish the company with a harsh ruling that could squelch future innovations. Google also argued that upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already is reshaping the search landscape, as conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice\u2019s four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier.\nIt was an argument that Mehta appeared to give serious consideration as he marveled at the speed at which the AI industry was growing. He also indicated he was still undecided on how much AI\u2019s potential to shake up the search market should be incorporated in his forthcoming ruling. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been struggling with,\u201d Mehta said.\nMehta spoke frequently at Friday\u2019s hearing, often asking probing and pointed questions to lawyers for both sides, while hinting that he was seeking a middle ground between the two camps\u2019 proposed remedies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to kneecap Google,\u201d the judge said, adding that the goal was to \u201ckickstart\u201d competitors\u2019 ability to challenge the search giant\u2019s dominance.\nMehta will spend much of the summer mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day. Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it can\u2019t take until the judge orders a remedy.\nGoogle\u2019s attorney John Schmidtlein asked Mehta to put a 60-day delay on implementing any proposed changes, which Justice prosecutor David Dahlquist immediately objected to.\n\u201cWe believe the market\u2019s waited long enough,\u201d Dahlquist said.\nWhile both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry\u2019s future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google.\nThe Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won\u2019t rein in Google\u2019s power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that\u2019s the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc., is valued at $2 trillion.\nGoogle has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine i nto an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet\u2019s main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.\nThe Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale.\nThe debate over Google\u2019s fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups.\nApple, which collects more than $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department\u2019s proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might even make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn\u2019t compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google.\nIn other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department\u2019s proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company\u2019s business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal that would require Google to share its data with rival search engines \u201cdoes not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship\u201d of their personal information.\nMehta said Friday that compared to some of the Justice Department\u2019s other proposals, there was \u201cless speculation\u201d about what might happen in the broader market if Google were forced to divest of Chrome. Schmidtlein said that was untrue, and such a ruling would be a wild overreach.\n\u201cI think that would be inequitable in the extreme,\u201d he said.\nDahlquist mocked some of the arguments against divesting Chrome.\n\u201cGoogle thinks it\u2019s the only one who can invest things,\u201d he said."

      "text": "Google illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A judge on Monday ruled that Google\u2019s ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation, a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world\u2019s best-known companies.\nThe highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country\u2019s biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century.\nAfter reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year\u2019s 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\u201cAfter having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\u201d Mehta wrote in his 277-page ruling. He said Google\u2019s dominance in the search market is evidence of its monopoly.\nGoogle \u201cenjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices,\u201d the ruling said.\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers\u2019 overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google\u2019s search engine processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\nKent Walker, Google\u2019s president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta\u2019s findings.\n\u201cThis decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make it easily available,\u201d Walker said.\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech\u2019s power during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\n\u201cThis victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \u201cNo company \u2014 no matter how large or influential \u2014 is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\u201d\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google\u2019s monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine \u2014 a lax approach that hurt consumers.\nMehta\u2019s ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google\u2019s product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \u201cGoogle is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\u201d\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta\u2019s decision as a step in the wrong direction. \u201cThe United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\u201d said Yael Ossowski, the center\u2019s deputy director.\nMehta\u2019s conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape. He scheduled a Sept. 6 hearing to begin setting the stage for the next phase.\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire, or preventing it from paying to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other devices. Or, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal \u2014 depending on the remedy,\u201d said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.\nRegardless, she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\nThe appeals process could take as long as five years, predicted George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division for most of the 1970s. That lengthy process will enable Google to fend off the likelihood of Mehta banning default search agreements, Hay said, but it probably won\u2019t shield the company from class-action lawsuits citing the judge\u2019s findings that advertisers were gouged with monopolistic pricing.\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft\u2019s bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival, with a market value of about $2 trillion.\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google\u2019s default search deals, it could squeeze Apple\u2019s profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\nGoogle\u2019s payments have helped Apple\u2019s steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company\u2019s last fiscal year. Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division has recently taken on some of the biggest companies in the world. It sued Apple in March and in May announced a sweeping lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its owner, Live Nation Entertainment. Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations into the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom.\nThe Biden administration has won some big cases, including blocking mergers of some of the world\u2019s biggest publishers as well as JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines. It\u2019s also had some notable setbacks, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department\u2019s allegations that Google\u2019s advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\u2014\u2014\nLiedtke reported from San Ramon, California. Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer and Barbara Ortutay contributed to this report."
