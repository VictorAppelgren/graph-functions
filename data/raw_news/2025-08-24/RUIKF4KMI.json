  "description": "When South Korean President Lee Jae Myung meets with Donald Trump at the White House for the first time on Monday, the Asian leader will face his biggest test since\u2026",
  "content": "Any perceived retreat by Lee on agriculture \u2014 giving American farmers greater access to South Korea\u2019s beef and rice markets \u2014 would risk spurring domestic backlash. South Korea earlier said rice and beef were excluded from the concessions it made in the negotiations, citing their political sensitivity. But Trump has said South Korea would be \u201ccompletely open\u201d to trade with the US, including its markets for agricultural goods. The comments leave open the possibility there could be differing interpretations of the pact, as was the case with Washington\u2019s deals with China and the UK. Most sectors in South Korea\u2019s economy will take a hit from Trump\u2019s barrage of tariffs, making it difficult for the agriculture industry to insist it should be exempt from the pain. In terms of economic output, the farming sector generates about 1.5% of gross domestic product. In contrast, the automobile and semiconductor industries are key drivers of the nation\u2019s total exports, which are equivalent to more than 40% of the economy. Chips accounted for around 21% of exports last year, while cars comprised around 10%. South Korea is expected to push for lower sectoral tariffs on key export items, including auto parts and semiconductors. Whether Lee will ultimately concede ground on the country\u2019s agricultural sector \u2014 a crucial support base for his liberal party \u2014 in exchange for better terms for exporters remains to be seen. Defense spending, which Trump has repeatedly framed in blunt financial terms, is at the heart of issues spanning politically fraught questions over the number of US troops stationed in South Korea to the Asian country\u2019s role in the broader regional security framework. Trump has been urging US allies to ramp up spending on security and rely less on the US. Against that backdrop he referred to South Korea as a \u201cmoney machine.\u201d The nation hosts 28,500 American troops to help deter threats from North Korea. While the defense cost-sharing issue wasn\u2019t addressed by tariff negotiators, a senior South Korean official earlier confirmed that the two countries are discussing expanding Seoul\u2019s defense spending in line with global trends. South Korea plans to spend 2.32% of its GDP on defense this year. One area of diplomacy where Lee and Trump may find common ground is the approach toward North Korea, as both are seeking a departure from the approach taken by their predecessors. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in person three times during the US president\u2019s first term, with those interactions failing to convince Kim to curb the development of his nuclear weapons program. North Korea has since rebuffed the idea of sitting down with the US and has emerged as a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, supporting his war on Ukraine. Kim last week called for the \u201crapid expansion\u201d of his country\u2019s nuclear weapons program, ramping up tensions just as the US and South Korea commenced joint military drills that Pyongyang views as a prelude to war. \u201cNorth Korea, of course, will be on the agenda, but the summit likely will not create an opening for either country\u2019s engagement with Pyongyang unless the two presidents agree to suspend US-ROK joint military drills and drop North Korea\u2019s denuclearization as a policy goal,\u201d said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center.",

      "text": "Why returning to the office is a pay cut for many people\nThe Ontario government and banks are forcing people back into the office but what if you don't want to go?\nIt\u2019s been more than five years since the pandemic and employers are still trying, unsuccessfully in many cases, to force their workers to return to the office.\nIt\u2019s not shocking to see employees object because the bottom line is that a return to the office constitutes a pay cut for them.\nThe Ontario government is one of the latest to say employees have to be in the office five days a week, though not until 2026. Premier Doug Ford wants municipalities to do the same.\nOthers, such as Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank of Canada, are making their employees commute at least four days a week come September.\nWhat\u2019s in it for the employees besides a loss of time, increased transportation costs and a higher budget for lunch and other expenses?\nEmployees got a financial break when the COVID-19 lockdown happened. There was a social impact, but anyone with children or family pressures gladly took that on even though \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 that burden still falls mainly on women.\nI\u2019m not going to debate productivity. Employers say they are losing it by having remote workers, while employees maintain the opposite.\nBut the financial debate comes down to who is paying to bring people into the office. Traditionally, the worker bears those costs.\n\u201cThe classic simple model of cities is everybody working downtown and they all have to commute. People traded the lower cost of a house in the suburbs for the longer commute,\u201d Tsur Somerville, a professor at the University of British Columbia\u2019s Sauder School of Business, said.\nThe pandemic let those commuters win on two counts: they got a bigger house and no commute, but household savings also rose to $350 billion.\n- Posthaste: Canadians are dragging their feet back to the office \u2014 with many opting to cheat or quit\n- Howard Levitt: When working from home means working two jobs\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nI\u2019ll declare my bias, having left a job that had moved to five days in the office, while the Financial Post has a flexible workplace policy.\nNancy D\u2019Onofrio, a director at recruitment and human resources company Randstad Canada, said workplace issues are at the forefront of negotiations today.\n\u201cFlexibility is key. It\u2019s just massive and people are still looking for it,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on our stats, flexibility ranks supreme.\u201d\nAmong 26,000 people surveyed globally by Randstad, 55 per cent won\u2019t take a job without scheduling flexibility. Another 37 per cent of workers quit a previous job because of a lack of flexibility.\n\u201cThe market is working for employers and people are scared to make moves,\u201d D\u2019Onofrio said. \u201cBut when the (job) market improves, there could be waves of people (leaving) in the future.\u201d\nAs a result, employers need to shift their strategy, especially for high-demand talent.\n\u201cSometimes employers struggle to find bilingual talent,\u201d she said, adding it is clear that people will take less money in exchange for flexibility. \u201cIf you are saying you have to come into the office, it will shrink your talent pool.\u201d\nDavid Cairns, a longtime broker at CBRE Group Inc. and now a strategist at Kadence Inc., a global hybrid workplace platform, said the latest return-to-office mandates will not work.\n\u201cLook at (the data) when it comes to cellphone pings, badge swipes, etc., and \u2018work from home\u2019 has been flat since 2023,\u201d he said, adding that new return-to-office mandates might add a \u201ccouple of percentage points.\u201d\nCairns points out that pre-pandemic, offices were occupied 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the time.\nBut there is a rising wave of returnees to offices in Toronto based on data from the Strategic Regional Research Alliance that measures the percentage of employees returning to the office compared to pre-COVID-19 times.\nAs of July 15, average weekly occupancy was 78 per cent compared to pre-pandemic. Peak day occupancy is 88 per cent and the low is 51 per cent. That looks like a lot of people still have flexible work arrangements.\n\u201cWe did this same thing last year,\u201d Cairns said about new mandates. \u201cThe only thing that looks a little different is that there are a few more. But I call it sentiment, not reality. The data shows it is not reality, nor will it be.\u201d\nJamie Grossman, managing principal and a broker at tenant representation firm Cresa, said there has been an uptick in leasing demand, but it\u2019s not one-size-fits-all for every industry.\n\u201cFinance is leaning more into the office. There is some flexibility, but there is a point now where people get an office or workstation that is their own,\u201d he said, adding that doesn\u2019t mean it gets used five days a week. \u201cWe will never go back to what pre-pandemic was.\u201d\nCairns said the math is simple. Daily commute times average 60 minutes round trip, which amounts to about $42 in driving costs based on mileage rates. The time cost of commuting based on average wages is worth $44 daily.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double hit. It\u2019s obvious why employees favour hybrid,\u201d he said, especially after adding in costs such as the \u201cuniform tax\u201d of office life, which he calculates at $8 per day. Food and coffee are $6 to $8 per day cheaper at home with healthier options. Utility costs go up, he said, but only $3 to $5 daily.\nBut what about your career path and salary?\n\u201cThe long tail of this is no,\u201d Cairns said, predicting that younger chief executives will grow into leadership roles and offer flexible working.\nJon Pinkus, an employment lawyer at Samfiru Tumarki LLP, said unionized government employees have limited choices legally.\nBut if your employment agreement is unclear, a change in your workplace could amount to constructive dismissal and lead to a settlement.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been deluged with clients,\u201d Pinkus said about workers looking for a legal out. \u201cIt might change as these things come into effect.\u201d\nIn the case of specific industries such as the oligopolies that are the banks, he said movement is inhibited because you can\u2019t find a job in the same industry and that limits pushback.\nSome people want to be back at the office, and, in some industries, there will be no choice because the employee has no leverage.\nIn others, such as high-demand technology jobs, employers are going to pay more for a rigid workplace policy.\nThe genie is out of the bottle; people will negotiate on flexible workplace policy. Flexibility is part of compensation. There is no turning back.\n\u2022 Email: gmarr@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Postal services around the world pause U.S. deliveries over tariff confusion\nMillions of low-value packages will lose their duty-free treatment next week\nPostal services across the world are suspending parcel deliveries to the United States, citing confusion about how to process millions of low-value packages that will lose their duty-free treatment next week.\nAs of Aug. 29, President Donald Trump is ending the so-called de minimis exemption that has applied to more than 4 million parcels flowing through the U.S. each day, driven largely by e-commerce.\nUnder the new regime, which started with China and Hong Kong in May, goods mailed from other countries will be subject to tariffs and compliance with Customs and Border Protection rules. Verifiable gifts valued at less than US$100 will remain duty-free, according to the White House.\nIn response to the changes, a growing number of national mail services are pausing some services to the U.S. as soon as this week, blaming a lack of clarity from U.S. authorities on how the duties will be collected and how to submit required data.\nIn Asia, Korea Post said it will halt accepting air parcels and some express mail services to the U.S. starting Tuesday, while keeping premium services, operated via private couriers, available subject to customs duties.\nSimilarly, Singapore\u2019s SingPost will suspend standard services for commercial shipments to America from Monday, with Speedpost\u2019s Express and Direct International Service available to retail and corporate customers, respectively.\nJapan warned of potential delays or returned parcels because of the changes, with authorities vowing to share more information when available.\nEuropean postal services also made adjustments in light of the changes, with several suspending shipments. Norway and Finland\u2019s mail carriers both said their stoppages begin Saturday.\n\u2018Key Questions\u2019\nDeutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany are also temporarily suspending \u201cthe acceptance and transport of business customer parcels via the postal network to the US.\u201d DHL Express service remains available.\n\u201cKey questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the US Customs and Border Protection will be carried out,\u201d DHL said in a statement Friday.\nThe Czech Republic has halted U.S.-bound parcels, while Austria\u2019s postal provider will stop accepting them after Aug. 25, citing the changes. Belgium\u2019s Bpost will reportedly pause shipments from Friday due to regulatory uncertainty.\nThe UK\u2019s Royal Mail plans a brief suspension for business account customers next week to implement a revised system for handling the newly imposed duties.\nAustralia Post has temporarily suspended its transit service deliveries \u2014 a small number of items from third countries sent through Australia to the US, a spokesperson confirmed. However, regular direct deliveries between the two countries will be unaffected.\nThe White House and CBP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe service interruptions highlight the seismic impact from Trump\u2019s decision to eliminate the de minimis exemption and raise concerns that cheap goods \u2014 especially those from China \u2014 will flood into other economies given the new barriers in the US.\nWashington\u2019s long-standing de minimis policy had allowed parcels packed with cheap items to flow into the US from around the world with little interruption or oversight, fuelled by consumer demand for bargains and immediacy. Trump\u2019s White House claims it\u2019s a loophole used to evade tariffs and funnel illegal drugs.\n\u2018Real Concern\u2019\nNow, postal services, online sellers, consumers and shipping companies are attempting to sort through the costly and complicated process to comply with US rules with little guidance from federal agencies.\n\u201cIt is a real concern that the dominoes are falling and there will be a ripple effect where more and more posts announce that they will be suspending packages to the US,\u201d said Kate Muth, executive director of the International Mailers Advisory Group, which represents the US international mailing and shipping industry.\nOnce the exemption ends, duties will be assessed on US imports shipped by mail based on the country-of-origin tariff rate that Trump imposed using his emergency powers. Alternatively, packages shipped via international post could be assessed with a temporary flat fee of $80 to $200 per item, but only for the next six months.\nCBP outlined in an Aug. 15 bulletin how the flat fees would be calculated, corresponding to the countries\u2019 tariff rates. The agency also offered some additional instruction to shippers on Thursday, when it issued guidance certifying two companies to collect and pay duties on behalf of international mail carriers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously very welcomed,\u201d Muth said, \u201cbut it\u2019s still a concern that we\u2019re just a week away and we only have the first two approved.\u201d\nThe fallout is extending beyond mail carriers. Starting Aug. 25, online marketplace Etsy Inc. plans to suspend its shipping label service for national mail services in Australia, Canada and the U.K. for US-bound packages, according to its website.\nThe company suggested that shippers use carriers with services in place that allow them to pay duties before goods arrive in the US, such as United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp.\nFedEx said it continues to accept and transport shipments to the U.S. and is unaffected by the postal operators\u2019 decisions. UPS had no immediate comment. The U.S. Postal Service didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u2014 With assistance from Cailley LaPara, Kate Sullivan, Ben Westcott, Heesu Lee, Maho Nambu, Andrea Tan and Heidi Taksdal Skjeseth.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Safe as houses? How Canada's ailing housing market could spell trouble for the whole economy\nReal estate is not only a major source of wealth for Canadians, it's also one of the country's top economic drivers. Jordan Gowling looks at how one of the worst housing markets in decades could drag on jobs, government revenues and the stability of the financial system\nArticle content\nHolly Calderwood has worked in the Vancouver real estate industry for two decades, and there\u2019s only been a handful of times when she has seen the housing market this bad.\n\u201cI think the last time I saw this was in 2008-2009 during the financial crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in 2020 during COVID-19.\u201d\nCalderwood has built a career specializing in selling luxury real estate from condos to waterfront properties, and she has recently noticed both a decline in sales and prices, as well as a rise in foreclosures.\n\u201cIt really picked up last year, but this year, too,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of foreclosures and then you just see the price dropping. Sometimes people are losing a couple of million.\u201d\nCalderwood attributes the causes for that trend to homeowners renewing at higher interest rates, a foreign buyer ban and a trade war with the United States that has put a damper on investment sentiment and demand.\nEconomists and industry insiders say some markets have entered a buyer\u2019s market for the first time in years, with cities such as Toronto, Vancouver and even Calgary recording significant drops in sales activity and posting record highs in inventory.\nThat could be a sign of price bubbles bursting, which is welcome news for would-be buyers, but could also spell trouble for the Canadian economy, which has relied on housing in recent years as an important economic driver, and it could lead to a drag on jobs, government revenues and the stability of the financial system.\nThe housing market recently peaked in mid-2022, before it started declining as the Bank of Canada began raising interest rates to deal with post-pandemic inflation. Earlier this year, the industry was hoping the market would begin a slow recovery after the central bank began delivering rate relief in 2024. Data from June and July seem to suggest a pickup in activity, but prices and sales are down compared to last year.\nRobert Hogue, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, projects home resales will decline 3.5 per cent in Canada to 467,100 units in 2025, with the drop largely concentrated in Ontario and British Columbia.\nTrade uncertainty and general worries about the Canadian economy have been blamed for the slowdown, but some markets have also become unaffordable for many buyers.\n\u201cWe have had a structural shift in interest rates,\u201d Charles St-Arnaud, chief economist at Alberta Central, said. \u201cThat changed the affordability equation quite significantly for many markets.\u201d\nHe said mortgage rates are 150 basis points higher than they were in the decade before the pandemic and that has left a lot of would-be buyers not being able to afford what they thought they could afford.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been seeing prices going nowhere; no one can afford to overbid for a house in aggregate,\u201d he said.\nBy the numbers\nSome politicians like to talk about lowering housing market prices as a social good, but housing and real estate investments remain a key economic driver for Canada and investors need to know they\u2019ll get a return on their money.\nIn May, Canada\u2019s newly appointed Housing Minister Gregor Robertson said the quiet part out loud when he was asked whether house prices should go down.\n\u201cNo, I think that we need to deliver more supply, make sure the market is stable,\u201d he said during a scrum on Parliament Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge part of our economy.\u201d\nLast year alone, the housing sector contributed $143.4 billion to the economy and supported 1.2 million jobs. Someone buying a home often translates into spin-off consumption in other areas of the economy, such as household appliances, renovation services and materials.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve often heard the saying in the U.S. that when the housing market is doing well, the general economy is doing well,\u201d St-Arnaud said. \u201cStrong housing starts, strong building construction, have a lot of spillover to the rest of the economy.\u201d\nResidential investment contributed 10 per cent to Canada\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021 during the pandemic housing boom and 7.5 per cent in 2023. The total value of housing assets grew to $4.2 trillion last year, representing 25 per cent of national wealth.\nThe total residential dollar value of all homes sold in Canada in June was $33.1 billion, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association, compared to $25.1 billion in June 2019, which represents a 24 per cent increase in six years. This has been helped by an increase in the average home price, which climbed to $691,634 in June from $505,500 in June 2019.\nMike Moffatt, an economist and founding director of the Missing Middle Initiative at the University of Ottawa, said governments are trying to achieve two things at once: restore affordability while also maintaining an environment that encourages confidence in the market and developers to keep building.\n\u201cThe governments are trying to do two things that are, on the face of it, inherently contradictory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do need prices to fall. But we\u2019ve seen over the last three years what happens when prices continue falling. It basically just breaks the economics for builders by eliminating the incentive to build. That creates a challenging situation where we want low prices, but we also want to create the conditions for builders to build more.\u201d\nMoffatt said all levels of government benefit from housing development, often through development charges, HST/GST and other fees.\nBut cracks are starting to show in this industry. The condo markets in Ontario and British Columbia have experienced significant losses in pricing value, with signs of financial distress in the sector. What used to be an attractive area for investors to park their money is no longer the case.\nCondo apartment sales have dropped by 75 per cent in the Greater Toronto Area and 37 per cent in Vancouver since the pandemic peak in 2022, according to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC).\n\u201cThe story of the dog-crate condominiums is well understood here in Toronto and in downtown Vancouver,\u201d Ron Butler, a mortgage broker and host of the Angry Mortgage Podcast, said.\nHe said buyers who bought at preposterous prices five years ago, particularly in the pre-construction condo market, will not be able to see a return on their investment. Even worse, a number of condo projects in Canada\u2019s two largest cities have entered receivership or been cancelled over the last two years.\nOne reason for the industry\u2019s decline is that Canada\u2019s population growth slowed to a crawl at the beginning of this year after several years of record-breaking growth in immigration. Some economists credited the previous surge in newcomers for masking the underlying weaknesses in the economy coming out of the pandemic as well as for keeping housing demand high in urban centres.\nButler said a combination of immigration curbs introduced last fall by the federal government and an increased number of for-purpose rentals entering the market are now the biggest contributors to a decline in rental prices.\n\u201cYou literally couldn\u2019t imagine a worse set of circumstances (for these investors),\u201d he said.\nCondo prices in Toronto\u2019s surrounding suburbs are recording even more significant drops than in the city itself, according to a recent report by Moody Analytics. For example, prices in Halton Hills have fallen by as much as 50 per cent from their peak.\nPrices are dropping elsewhere, too. The average national price of a one-bedroom rental unit in Canada decreased 3.6 per cent year over year to $1,857 in May 2025, according to the latest National Rent Report by Rentals.ca and Urbanation Inc.\n\u201cOdds are that rent is probably going to continue falling over the near term, so I wouldn\u2019t expect investors to make their way back anytime soon,\u201d Hogue said.\nHe said the 10 per cent decline from the peak prices in the Toronto area is significant, but it has not completely reversed the price run-up experienced during the pandemic.\n\u201cA 10 per cent price decline historically would have been very significant and a big correction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after the period we have gone through, it\u2019s only reversing a small fraction of the price increase we saw during the pandemic.\u201d\nTiming and speculation\nInvestor speculation in the real estate industry has often been a point of criticism from housing advocates. Butler said today\u2019s condo market debacle is what happens when you build a product solely around the priorities of investors instead of homeowners since it can lead to an oversupply of a product no one wants or can afford.\n\u201cThe model of building high-rise condos is that you have to sell 75 per cent of the building on a presale basis, with people who will give you 20 per cent down,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all, a lot of first-time homebuyers don\u2019t have the 20 per cent or need to come by it slowly, and, secondly, most of the 75 per cent of presales were comprised of investors.\u201d\nInvestor participation in the real estate market has also been criticized for turning housing into an asset and for taking capital away from other productive parts of the economy. Canada\u2019s lagging business investment and productivity are longstanding issues.\nBut many regular homeowners often use their houses as a funding source for retirement or it may be the only major asset they own.\n\u201cWe can think about the boomers who are sitting on big appreciation in their house values, but we can also think of recent buyers who probably overstretched themselves to get on the market,\u201d St-Arnaud said. \u201cHow do we deal with that if in 25 years they have zero appreciation on their main asset and they can\u2019t save for anything else?\u201d\nWhile this price adjustment is happening in the condo market, it is also happening in the house market in certain regions in Southern Ontario and British Columbia.\nBut not all regions are equal, since housing markets in the Prairies and Quebec are showing some resilience.\n\u201cThe Quebec market seems to be on a sustained gradual upward movement,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a reflection of the fact that it\u2019s just not badly priced.\u201d\nBut once fast-growing markets such as Calgary are also facing more buyer-friendly conditions for the first time in years, though conditions are not as bad as they are for sellers in Vancouver and Toronto.\nJustin Warthe, a realtor and real estate investor in Calgary, said the city\u2019s benchmark prices rose above $700,000 during the 2022-2023 peak from the mid-$500,000 range in 2020. The market has cooled since mid-2023, when interest rates rose, and the market has returned to having more than three months of inventory.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely more of a buyer\u2019s market right now,\u201d he said.\nWarthe said he has to sit some clients down who think their houses will sell overnight and tell them that\u2019s not the reality anymore.\nStill, despite this softening in some markets, St-Arnaud said Canada\u2019s housing remains the most expensive in the G7.\n\u201cHouse prices are still 26 per cent above where they were pre-COVID,\u201d he said.\nTo get into the market, Canadians have heavily leveraged themselves, with residential mortgage debt reaching $2.3 trillion in February this year, compared to $1.6 trillion in 2019. Nearly half of all lending by Canadian banks is for residential mortgages.\nThe increase in mortgages has led to an increase in household debt, though Canada\u2019s current debt-to-disposable-income ratio at 173 per cent is a slight decline from the 179 per cent reported in 2024.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the highest in the G20,\u201d St-Arnaud said. \u201cHow much more debt do we want our households to take? How much more vulnerability?\u201d\nThe worst-case scenario for mortgage renewals if a longstanding global trade war leads to higher unemployment and depleted house prices was laid out by the Bank of Canada in its financial stability report in May.\n\u201cResults suggest that the share of mortgages in arrears by at least 90 days could rise to a level comparable with or higher than levels reached in the 2008-09 global financial crisis,\u201d the central bank said.\nThis is, of course, the most severe scenario policymakers worked out and does not represent a likely eventuality.\nAbout 60 per cent of mortgages in Canada will renew in 2025 or 2026, with 60 per cent of those mortgage holders expected to see an increase in their payments. That said, many of those mortgage holders are expected to be able to handle the higher payments.\nBut, as many economists have noted, the mortgage renewal risk will only be contained if the labour market holds. The unemployment rate held steady at 6.9 per cent in July, but Statistics Canada said net employment has only increased by 27,000 since the beginning of the year.\n\u201cA chief risk officer will tell you the three most important things about mortgage default, it\u2019s unemployment, unemployment and unemployment,\u201d said Butler.\nFor now, the weakness has been driven by slow hiring, not layoffs, and recent GDP data suggests economic growth has merely flatlined in the second quarter, so the country has not entered a contraction.\n\u201cAs long as there are no job losses, as long as people still have an income, we\u2019ll be OK,\u201d St-Arnaud said. \u201cIf there is a negative shock, if there is a recession and we start to see relatively big layoffs, I would be really concerned for the housing market and the ramifications to the broader economy.\u201d\nBut the unemployment rate is rising in many places. For example, the jobless rate hit 7.9 per cent in Ontario in July and increased to 5.9 per cent in British Columbia. The construction industry led the way, with employment down 22,000 positions in July after five consecutive months of little change in the sector, according to Statistics Canada\u2019s latest release.\nThe stalling economy seems to be affecting homebuilders. CMHC forecasts that housing starts will come in at 237,800 in 2025, down from 245,367 in 2024. The Crown corporation also forecasts 227,734 housing starts next year and 220,016 in 2027. Those figures are all well below the 430,000 to 480,000 new homes per year it said are needed to restore affordability to 2019 levels.\n\u201cWe are seeing the most expensive markets experiencing a price decline,\u201d Moffatt said. \u201cAnd because of it, new home sales have basically evaporated in those two markets.\u201d\nCalderwood said developers are dealing with tariff-related cost increases and the new-build market has considerably slowed.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had builders contact me and say it\u2019s the slowest they have ever seen it,\u201d she said.\nMoffatt said this slowdown will only exacerbate the supply issue. It may be hard to imagine now, but that lack of supply could fuel another bubble in pricing by the end of the decade.\n\u201cIf we go through a period where nothing gets built and then the economy improves, we\u2019re not going to have a lot of inventory once people are ready to buy again,\u201d he said.\nButler said the supply of homes that people want to buy will remain constrained for the foreseeable future.\n\u201cThe undersupply is in first-time, low-rise homes for people to buy, whether they\u2019re single-family, townhouses or semis,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that particular area, in Ontario and British Columbia, building of that product collapsed 16 months ago.\u201d\nThe CMHC expects the average house price to drop by two per cent this year, with a slow recovery starting in 2026 as trade tensions ease and economic conditions improve.\nCalderwood said markets can quickly change, but she remains pessimistic that things will improve.\n\u201cA lot of realtors say they can predict the market, but we\u2019re not psychics,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as Trump is in power and with that all the tariffs and chaos, I don\u2019t see it trending upward.\u201d\n\u2022 Email: jgowling@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Canada AI by the numbers \u2014 how much money is being spent and who is spending it\nCanada has been a hotbed of AI talent and research, but continues to play catch-up in capitalizing on its AI advantages\nCanada has been a trailblazer in artificial intelligence (AI) in many ways: the work of Canadian scientists and institutions laid the foundations for today\u2019s AI systems, including Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio\u2019s research on deep neural networks. Eight years ago, Canada became the first country in the world to launch a national AI strategy. And this year, the country joined the modest ranks of nations that have appointed a national AI minister.\nUnder Prime Minister Mark Carney, Canada is placing even bigger bets on AI, championing it as a tool to jumpstart productivity and economic growth and to shore up national security as other countries accelerate their sovereign AI strategies. Carney has promised to incorporate the technology into the public sector, provide tax breaks for companies that adopt AI and slash regulatory red tape on AI infrastructure efforts such as the building of data centres.\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about Canada\u2019s AI ecosystem in numbers.\nHow much has the government invested in AI?\nSince 2016, the federal government has invested more than $4.4 billion in AI and digital research infrastructure.\nIn 2017, Ottawa launched the world\u2019s first-ever national AI strategy \u2014 the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy \u2014 which directed funds toward developing the country\u2019s AI R&D firepower, talent pipeline and efforts to develop and adopt AI standards.\nIn December 2024, the former Justin Trudeau government announced the Sovereign AI Compute Strategy. The price tag: roughly $2.4 billion to build out Canada\u2019s public supercomputing infrastructure and to help Canadian researchers and businesses access AI compute resources.\n- Ottawa teams up with startup Cohere to bring AI to the public sector\n- Cohere hits US$6.8-billion valuation and snags Meta's former AI head\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nHow much funding have Canadian AI startups received?\nCanadian startups attracted US$15.3 billion in private investment from 2013 to 2024, which ranks fourth worldwide, according to the 2025 AI Index Report by Quid and Stanford University. The United States took the top spot, receiving more than US$470 billion during the same period, followed by China at US$119.3 billion and the United Kingdom with US$28.1 billion.\nPitchBook Inc., a research firm and financial data provider, recorded similar private investment numbers: it counted 2,468 venture-capital deals in Canada\u2019s AI space from 2014 to August 2025 totalling US$14.5 billion. Venture-capital deal activity in Canadian AI peaked in 2021, when it hit 345 deals and raised US$3.69 billion, according to PitchBook.\nCanada\u2019s position, however, plunges to eighth place when it comes to the creation of newly funded AI companies: it created 51 such businesses last year, while first-place U.S. launched 1,073 companies, the Stanford report said. Toronto-based Cohere Inc. wears the crown of the country\u2019s top-funded AI startup: it has raised US$1.44 billion since its founding in 2019.\nWho are the top investors in Canadian AI startups?\nDomestic investors have been, by far, the most active in funding Canadian AI startups over the past decade. Canadian firms accounted for 26 of the top 30 \u2014 or 86 per cent \u2014 venture investors in homegrown AI startups from 2014 to 2024 when ranked by deal count, according to numbers from PitchBook.\nMontreal-headquartered Business Development Bank of Canada Capital Inc., better known as BDC Capital, participated in 148 deals and ranked first. Another Montreal-based firm, Real Investment Management Inc., or Real Ventures, came in second with 81 deals, followed by Toronto\u2019s MaRS Investment Accelerator Fund Inc. with 77 deals. Four American firms made the list: Plug & Play Venture Group LLC, Right Side Capital Management LLC, 500 Startups Management Co. LLC, and Techstars Central LLC.\nToronto-based early-stage investor Radical Ventures Investments Inc. recorded a median deal size of US$10 million, ranking it first among venture capital firms in that category. Across Canada\u2019s startup ecosystem, Canadian investors dominate early stage and smaller deals, while U.S. investors participate more in later-stage and larger funding rounds, according to the Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (CVCA).\nHow much \u2018compute\u2019 is available in Canada?\nCanadian researchers and industry have long said that Canada lacks the computational resources, known as \u201ccompute,\u201d required to train and run AI models and to compete in the AI economy.\n\u201cCompared to its G7 peers, Canada holds the lowest amount of publicly available computing infrastructure and performance,\u201d said a 2024 report by The Dais, Toronto Metropolitan University\u2019s public policy think tank.\nOttawa\u2019s Sovereign AI Compute Strategy has helped grow Canada\u2019s compute from 41 petaFLOPS \u2014 a measure of computing speed \u2014 in November 2023 to 78 PFLOPS as of June 2025, according to new calculations by Graham Dobbs, a co-author of the Dais report and a senior research associate of innovation and technology at the Conference Board of Canada.\n\u201cThe increase is substantial, as Canada\u2019s compute expansion is mainly in AI-specific infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cCanada added three more government (and) research computing infrastructure sites\u201d in the aforementioned timeframe.\nStill, rapidly growing investments in AI infrastructure worldwide have decreased Canada\u2019s share of global compute to 0.6 per cent from 0.7 per cent during the same period, according to Dobbs.\nWhere does Canada stand in terms of AI patents?\nCanadian researchers and institutions accounted for 1.8 per cent of the 85,144 worldwide patented AI inventions from 1998 to 2017, according to a 2022 report by the Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED).\nISED lacks updated numbers beyond 2017, but Stanford University\u2019s 2025 AI Index Report said Canada failed to crack the top 15 in terms of granted AI patents per 100,000 inhabitants in 2023.\nGeorgetown University\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET), a research organization, similarly said Canada accounted for 0.6 per cent of the patents granted worldwide from 2018 to 2022, trailing the U.S., China, Japan and Australia. CSET data tracks patents based on the location of the initial filing, which includes those from non-Canadian researchers and institutions.\n\u201cPatent counts alone don\u2019t measure innovation quality, but they are a strong proxy for where AI intellectual property, and therefore future economic value, will accrue,\u201d said Daniel Wigdor, a University of Toronto computer science professor and cofounder and chief executive of venture studio Axl, which is aiming to build 50 AI companies in Canada by 2030.\nIndustry calls to keep Canadian IP in the country are growing. Around 75 per cent of AI patents produced by Canadian researchers and institutions leave Canada, with the bulk ending up with U.S. tech giants and seven per cent assigned to Canadian firms, according to research from Jim Hinton, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a think tank in Waterloo, Ont., that analyzed data up to 2023 from global patent offices such as the World Intellectual Property Office and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\nThe result, Hinton said, is that Canada is experiencing an \u201cAI ownership crisis,\u201d while Wigdor said, \u201cWe risk becoming a talent and IP farm for others (despite) having world-class AI talent and public investment in research.\u201d\n\u2022 Email: ylau@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "CRA penalizes taxpayer for failure to report the sale of residential real estate\nJamie Golombek: Taxpayer failed to report capital gain of $159,282 and the CRA also hit him with a $21,000 gross negligence penalty\nReviews and recommendations are unbiased and products are independently selected. Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page.\nPerhaps the biggest tax break remaining for ordinary Canadians is the principal residence exemption (PRE), which allows individuals to realize an unlimited tax-free gain upon the sale of their home. Contrast that to the U.S. where the exemption is currently limited to US$250,000 for single filers (US$500,000 for married couples filing jointly), although last month, a bill was introduced in the U.S. that would provide an unlimited exemption just like in Canada.\nUnder our tax rules, if you do sell your principal residence, as of 2016 you need to report that sale on your tax return even if it fully qualifies for the PRE. The designation of your principal residence is reported on the front page of Schedule 3 of your return, and you must also complete the appropriate sections of Form T2091(IND), Designation of a Property as a Principal Residence by an Individual.\nFor a property to qualify as your principal residence for a particular tax year, four criteria must be satisfied: 1. the property must be a housing unit; 2. you must own the property (either alone or jointly with someone else); 3. you or your spouse (or common-law partner) or kids must \u201cordinarily inhabit\u201d the property and 4. you must \u201cdesignate\u201d the property as a principal residence.\nNote that a seasonal residence, such as a cottage, cabin, lake house or even ski chalet, can be considered to be \u201cordinarily inhabited in the year\u201d even if you only use it during vacation periods \u201cprovided that the main reason for owning the property is not to gain or produce income.\u201d\nA rental property, however, is generally not considered a principal residence, and you could be on the hook for capital gains tax when you sell it. Similarly, you may be precluded from claiming the PRE if you bought or built a home with the purpose of selling it for a profit.\nIn recent years the government has been cracking down on residential house flipping. New anti-flipping rules for residential real estate (including rental properties) came into effect Jan. 1, 2023, and were designed to \u201creduce speculative demand in the marketplace and help to cool excessive price growth.\u201d\n- CRA loses case as judge rules in favour of taxpayers' Home Buyers' Plan withdrawal timing\n- CRA prevails over Holt Renfrew saleswoman in battle over wardrobe deduction\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nThe rules prevent you from claiming the PRE to shelter the capital gain realized on the sale of your home if you\u2019ve owned it for less than 12 months. And, any gain on the sale of residential real estate held under 12 months is taxable not as a 50 per cent capital gain, but rather as 100 per cent taxable business income, subject to certain exemptions for life events such as death, disability, separation and work relocation.\nIf you sold residential real estate (including a rental property) that you owned for less than 365 days, you are obligated to declare that sale on Part 2 of the Schedule 3 of your personal tax return for the year of sale.\nAnd, although the flipped property rules only came into play for 2023 and future years, the Canada Revenue Agency can still challenge real estate flips that took place prior to 2023 if it feels a taxpayer has speculated and flipped a property for a quick profit.\nIn recent years, the CRA has also been cracking down on perceived abuse of the PRE even when properties are held for more than a year. Take the recent decision of the Tax Court, decided in June 2025, involving a Toronto taxpayer whose 2016 tax return was reassessed by the CRA because he failed to report a capital gain of $159,282 on the sale of residential real estate. To make matters worse, he was also hit with a $21,000 gross negligence penalty for failure to report the gain.\nThe taxpayer, an avid investor who was \u201cparticularly fond of real property,\u201d purchased several properties along a certain portion of Toronto\u2019s Yonge Street between 2010 and 2017. In 2016, the taxpayer sold multiple real estate holdings.\nOne of these properties was his principal residence in which he lived from May 2010 to July 2016. The CRA allowed him to claim the PRE on the sale of this property even though he failed to report its disposition on his 2016 tax return.\nThe taxpayer also failed to report the disposition of a second property sold at a gain in 2016, claiming that it was \u201calways intended as a principal residence.\u201d This claim was rejected by the CRA for a variety of reasons, including the fact he never resided at the property, did not file a T2091 to report it and already had a different principal residence at the same time in the same taxation year.\nUnfortunately, this was not the first time the taxpayer failed to report a disposition of real estate. It turns out that in 2011 the taxpayer was also reassessed, penalized and \u201cred flagged for future vigilance by the (CRA)\u201d for failure to report a sale.\nIn his defense, the taxpayer claimed that he reviewed his 2016 tax return with his accountant, reported the disposition of two other properties he sold in 2016, but omitted the gain on his principal residence and the property in question, believing that the gains were sheltered by the PRE.\nThe taxpayer blamed his accountant for failing to disclose the sale of his principal residence since 2016 was the first year this was required and his \u201caccountant likely was ignorant\u201d of the need to report it. When asked why his accountant didn\u2019t testify, the taxpayer said it was because he had \u201cmoved to the States.\u201d\nBut the judge wasn\u2019t buying this excuse, noting that the taxpayer had a master\u2019s degree, was experienced in real estate and even became a licensed real estate broker in 2022. The judge upheld the CRA\u2019s assessment of the unreported gain.\nThe judge also concluded that in failing to report any disposition from the sale of the property, the taxpayer \u201cknowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence\u201d made a false statement or omission on his 2016 tax return. Consequently, the CRA was justified in levying a gross negligence penalty for failure to report the gain associated with the sale of the property.\nJamie Golombek, FCPA, FCA, CFP, CLU, TEP, is the managing director, Tax & Estate Planning with CIBC Private Wealth in Toronto.
