      "feedback": "Strong start, but to reach world‑class quality, overhaul the piece into a tight 3–4 scenario map over 3–6 months with explicit triggers, invalidations, and timing windows, and then anchor every claim to quantified signals from the sources; specifically, rewrite to (1) build a clear base case plus 1–2 alt paths (bullish NFLX re‑rating on faster international monetization; bearish NFLX on sharper multiple compression if growth slows), plus a policy/AI‑cycle shock alt, with entry/trigger dates and exit criteria; (2) map catalysts/triggers and invalidations with numeric anchors: NFLX Q2 15.9% revenue growth and 86.9% FCF rise; 8.8% US TV viewing share via Nielsen; P/E of 51.7; international growth runway vs pricing power constraints; Costa Coffee sale estimate ~£2b; Disney’s January 4, 2026 last‑day‑of‑old‑perk; Wedbush AI‑30 changes adding CrowdStrike/Roblox/GE Vernova/Nebius and dropping Adobe/C3.ai; KO P/E ~25/ forward ~23.7 and 2.9% yield; KO/PG/XOM/SO/MAA/SHW dividend emphasis; (3) lay out a macro/flows lens:  AI‑driven cap‑flow shifts, sector rotation into income plays (YX2J8NHZ1), and potential dividend‑led demand amid moderating growth; (4) sharpen causal chain: AI cycle momentum and Netflix’s monetization push power near‑term subs/ARPU gains but pressure from high multiple; Alphabet/YouTube provides a steady cash/valuation ballast; Coca‑Cola, Disney, and dividend names anchor risk/defense in the 3–6 month window; (5) quantify every claim and reconcile conflicts (Netflix’s growth punch vs. P/E risk; YouTube/Alphabet voting control vs. broad institutional ownership; Coca‑Cola’s Costa Coffee sale vs. slow M&A pace); (6) add explicit watch‑list signals and confidence: NFLX quarterly cues, AI‑30 rotation signals, Costa sale progress, Disney margin dynamics, KO/PG dividend sustainability, and clear invalidation rules (e.g., NFLX P/E re‑rating fails to offset growth slowdown by 2H2025); (7) tighten formatting so base case, alts, risks, watch‑list signals, timing windows, and path‑dependency are explicit in separate, labeled sections; (8) ensure precise sourcing: attribute each quantitative claim to 61SVFUKBY, A88B7V8PY, STBVARD8F, U3ZK13ZQI, YX2J8NHZ1, and KO data within STBVARD8F, with no uncited assertions. These edits will elevate depth, reduce speculation, and deliver a coherent, decision‑ready 3–6 month view.",
