      "feedback": "Your draft captures the right drivers but misses several key Argos‑style requirements.  \n1. **Canonical mapping** – every Up/Down line must explicitly link to a canonical handle (e.g., ust10y or mortgage‑rate futures) with a signed magnitude range (bp or %). Add “mortgage‑rate” or “ust10y” in brackets and state the expected move (e.g., +10–20 bp or –10–20 bp).  \n2. **Magnitude & probability** – include a concrete range for each scenario and tie the probability to the cited evidence (e.g., 20 % probability of a Fed‑rate hike per LF0UUL917).  \n3. **Catalyst window** – each line must list a specific date or window (e.g., Fed policy meeting 16‑17 Sept, core CPI 1 Oct).  \n4. **Trade/Outlook format** – the Outlook line is currently a prose summary. Rewrite it as a single Outlook line:  \n   `Down | 12–18 mo | 6.5–7 % corridor | Fed cuts & inflation easing | Fed hike, debt surge, loan‑demand spike | Fed policy 16‑17 Sept, core CPI 1 Oct | 70% | 60`.  \n   If you prefer a swing trade, produce a Swing Trade line with entry/stop/target and R/R.  \n5. **Avoid drift** – remove any mention of the dollar or tariffs unless you explicitly tie them to mortgage‑rate movement. Keep the focus on mortgage rates and their UST10y proxy.  \n6. **Citation placement** – place the ID citations immediately after the fact they support (e.g., “Fed raises rates (LF0UUL917)”).  \nApply these edits to produce a concise, actionable outlook that meets the 4‑line Up/Down format and a single Outlook/Swing Trade line.",
