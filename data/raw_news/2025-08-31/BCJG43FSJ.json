Follow the link. It\u2019s also a place to report human trafficking of immigrant workers, and Title VII employment discrimination,\" Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights at the DOJ, posted to X on Friday.OVER 55 MILLION VISA HOLDERS SUBJECTED TO CONTINUOUS VETTING AMID TRUMP ADMIN CRACKDOWNThe DOJ is also allowing people to send in tips for possible human trafficking violations related to temporary visa programs.H-1B visas were the subject of debate earlier this year, as many opponents argued they hinder American talent in key sectors like technology, whereas others believe it bolsters the economy.\"The main function of the H-1B visa program and other guest worker initiatives is not to hire \u2018the best and the brightest,\u2019 but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad,\" Sen.

The reality is that's not actually what H1Bs are. Most of them are from one country, India.

The outlet added that if violations are found, visas will be revoked, and if the individual is in the U.S., he or she could be subject to deportation.\n\"The department\u2019s continuous vetting includes all of the more than 55 million foreigners who currently hold valid U.S. visas,\" a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital.\nThe spokesperson added that the department cancels visas when there are \"indications of a potential ineligibility, which includes things like any indicators of overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity or providing support to a terrorist organization.\"\nThe information the department is reviewing in the vetting process includes law enforcement records and \"any other information that comes to light\" after the visa is issued that could indicate ineligibility.\n\"As part of the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to protect U.S. national security and public safety, since Inauguration Day, the State Department has revoked more than twice as many visas, including nearly four times as many student visas, as during the same time period last year,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe announcement came the same day Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. would pause the issuance of worker visas for commercial truck drivers. The decision likely stems from last week\u2019s fatal crash in Florida, which allegedly involved an illegal immigrant truck driver.\nBLUE STATE INVESTIGATES HOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT TRUCKER GOT LICENSE BEFORE DEADLY FLORIDA CRASH\nHarjinder Singh is accused of making an illegal U-turn on the Florida Turnpike, causing an accident that killed three people. It is unclear how he obtained his license, as he failed an English proficiency assessment and could not correctly identify several highway signs. Singh has since been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOn Thursday, Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins traveled to California to take custody of Singh, who fled there after the crash. Collins vowed that Florida would hold Singh accountable and ensure justice was served."

      "text": "Immigration: What to know about border security, US immigration policy and more\nImmigration in the United States has become a controversial topic in the political arena. There are several steps one must take to become a U.S. citizen, which are outlined on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. These steps include preparing an application for naturalization, paying fees, completing an interview and taking the oath of allegiance to the United States.\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration prioritized securing the border and cracking down on the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the country. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is the federal agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws. Since beginning his second term in the White House, Trump has worked to initiate the deportation of undocumented immigrants.\nThousands of people gathered in downtown Los Angeles for protest demonstrations over immigration. The scene turned from peaceful to violent as rising unrest prompted police to deploy tear gas. The Los Angeles immigration protests were among other nationwide protests against federal immigration raids conducted by ICE agents. California Gov. has continued to blame Trump for the escalating protests, claiming that they were peaceful demonstrations before the National Guard and Trump's rhetoric intensified the conflict.\n\u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d the nation's newest detention facility for undocumented immigrants, is located in the Florida Everglades and surrounded by swampland teeming with alligators and pythons. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis authorized the construction of the detention center on a 30-square-mile property in the swamplands of Miami-Dade County under an emergency order in June 2025. The property, a former airport, has been outfitted with sturdy tent structures to house 5,000 undocumented immigrants amid the Trump administration's deportation blitz to remove the millions of migrants who entered the country during the Biden administration."

      "text": "Ron DeSantis is a Republican politician who currently serves as the 46th governor of Florida. From 2013 to 2018, DeSantis previously served in the House of Representatives for Florida's 6th district. He is widely seen as a major conservative political leader and a possible 2024 Republican presidential contender.\nBefore entering politics, DeSantis was a Navy lieutenant, an advisor for SEAL Team One, and was later deployed to Iraq. In 2008, he was appointed to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida to serve as a Special Assistant attorney until 2010. DeSantis received his undergraduate degree at Yale and graduated from Harvard Law School.\nDuring his tenure in Congress, DeSantis gained a reputation as an ardent defender of President Donald Trump by opposing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. In 2018, he won the Florida gubernatorial campaign against Democratic Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum by a thin margin, triggering a recount. DeSantis would go on to win the governorship by a 0.4% margin.\nDeSantis's stardom in conservative politics took off partly due to the coronavirus and vaccination policies he implemented in Florida during the pandemic. He prohibited private businesses from enforcing face masks and vaccination requirements. He received praise from conservatives such as Trump but was criticized by those on the left, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. In October 2021, Florida\nrecorded the lowest COVID-19 daily average case per 100,000 residents in the United States, according to the state government.\nDeSantis also signed a law prohibiting educational instructors from teaching students about sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten to the third grade. Critics of the bill have referred to it as the \"Don't Say, Gay Bill.\" After the bill's passage, Disney admonished the Florida government and vowed to help fight the law in court. As a result, DeSantis stripped \"Walt Disney World\" of its self-governing status in the state. During the 2022 Florida gubernatorial election on November 8th, 2022, Desantis was reelected by nearly 60% of the electorate."

Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told Rubio May 20.\nRUBIO SPEARHEADS MASSIVE STATE DEPT REORGANIZATION SET TO ELIMINATE, MERGE MORE THAN 300 OFFICES\nA student visa permits those outside the U.S. to study in the country for a set amount of time at an academic institution. It\u2019s different from a green card, which allows an individual already in the U.S. who is not an American citizen to remain in the country.\nThe crackdown on student visas aligns with several executive orders President Donald Trump signed in January, aimed at safeguarding the U.S. from foreign terrorists and other national security threats, along with combating antisemitism.\nRUBIO OVERHAULING 'BLOATED' STATE DEPARTMENT IN SWEEPING REFORM\nOne of the executive orders instructed the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security, attorney general and director of national intelligence, to \"vet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States, particularly those aliens coming from regions or nations with identified security risks.\"\nA separate executive order Trump signed ordered the U.S. to use \"all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\""
