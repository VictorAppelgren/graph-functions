  "title": "Bay County's most overlooked tree is also its most important: here's the longleaf story",
  "description": "The longleaf pine was the basis of local industry and is part of why northwest Florida is a biodiversity hotspot. It's in trouble.",
  "content": "PANAMA CITY \u2014 There's one tree that dominates much of northwest Florida that most are likely unaware of: the longleaf pine tree.\n\nThis southern pine once towered over most of the southeast, covering 90 million acres between Texas and Virginia. Old photos show impressively wide and tall old-growth tall trees dwarfing early pioneers, a far cry from the skinnier and shorter trees we see today.\n\nA mature longleaf stands between 80 to 100 feet tall with a trunk 3 feet in diameter. They can grow to be up to 120 feet tall.\n\nWood from the longleaf pine was valuable because of its durability. In places like Bay County and across the southeast, naval stores for ship building were a large economic driver for local economies. Over 200 years, timbermen were able to reduce the range of the tree to just over 3 million acres.\n\nCoastal towns such as Panama City and Port St Joe built up around the industry, with papermills processing all this timber into a fine pulp for other uses. Forestry at the time was a less-than-sustainable business. Before the 1930s, the \"cut and get out,\" method was common. Lumbermen would go from area to area clear-cutting forests.\n\nThe longleaf pine, for all its useful traits, can also take 150 years to reach its full maturity. In their place, faster growing species like slash and loblolly pines were replanted.\n\nTurpentining, the act of extracting a sap resin from the trees, was also a big industry in Florida and Georgia particularly. Before European colonization, indigenous people would use the sap from the trees as insect repellent, antiseptic, and in the construction of canoes.\n\nEarly settlers set up stills where they would turn the sap into industrial products for use on boats and in other chemicals. Turpentine camps were known for harsh conditions and often used the enslaved and leased-convicts. This led to them gaining a reputation of being rowdy and dangerous places.\n\nThe mass scale of turpentining further led to the destruction of longleaf pine forests across the southeast and locally. Vanishing forests, the end of the convict-leasing system, and advancements in technology eventually resulted in the end of turpentining by the 1950s.\n\nAerial imagery from 1941 shows a largely barren and deforested landscape in Bay County. In the end, the longleaf was left with only 3% of their historical range.\n\nWhy should we care about a tree species?\n\nSome readers might be wondering why they should care about a tree. There's a few reasons:\n\nMore than half of the 1,630 estimated plant species found in the southeast are only found within longleaf pine ecosystems. This biodiversity is second to a tropical rainforest.\n\nThe Florida Panhandle is one of five biodiversity hotspots in North America. The longleaf expanses and unique geography provide refuge for rare and endemic species to thrive.\n\nKeystone species are plants or animals that can cause whole ecosystems to collapse without their presence. The longleaf pine is considered one of them.\n\nOne of the threatened species harbored within longleaf forests is the gopher tortoise, which is also classified as a keystone species. Some 350 other species rely on the tortoise and their burrows. Longleaf ecosystems provide sandy oils and plant diets that greatly benefit the animal.\n\nThe threatened red-cockaded woodpecker is an iconic and secondary keystone species within the longleaf habitat. They are very picky with nest-building locations and often opt to live in the sometimes softer-interior of older longleaf pine trees. Other small mammals and insects go on to use the burrows they've carved out of the pines.\n\nLongleafs are also more resilient against natural disasters than other pines. Surveys found after Hurricanes Katrina and Michael showed that the trees were better-able to withstand high winds than other pines.\n\nThese trees can adjust their water uptake during droughts, are more pest-resistant than other species, and are evolved to survive wildfires.\n\nBefore European colonization, the longleaf pine was an essential part of life for tribes like the Choctaws and Creeks.\n\nEvery part of the tree down to the bark was used to build homes. Logs of larger pines were used to build canoes and their bark was used for paving village streets.\n\nAccording to a USDA report, the Cherokee believed the pines to have eternal lives. When there was a death in a home they would use the smoke of cooked pine branches to purify the dwelling.\n\nParts of the trees were used in medicines and there's a still-standing and deep-rooted indigenous craft of weaving baskets from the needles. Early settlers also took part in the craft.\n\nThe open and park-like understory of longleaf pine forests allowed early pioneers to graze their cattle beneath the pines. Although the deforestation largely brought this practice to an end, it is still practiced in some areas and is known as silvopasture.\n\nThe term \"Florida cracker,\" describing early white pioneers, is said to have come from the sound of ranch hands cracking whips trying to corral cattle roaming among the longleafs.\n\n\"It's just a part of our core being of if you live in the south,\" said Vernon Compton, director of the Gulf Coastal Plain Ecosystem Partnership for the Longleaf Alliance. \"The longleaf pine forest built a lot of particularly southern cities, but you would have found it throughout the growth of our country when the longleaf forests were being clear cut in the late 1800s and early 1900s so it really built a lot of our houses, commercial buildings, furniture, doors, windows, and many of our historic cities in the south.\"\n\nA healthy longleaf pine ecosystem relies on fire to survive. The flames snuff out invasive and competing species, allowing native plants and the longleaf tree to thrive. Part of the reason the understory of a healthy longleaf ecosystem is so open and non-crowded is because of fire-management.\n\nIn its natural state, periodic fires would occur naturally. Early indigenous groups understood the value of fire to the ecosystem and practiced controlled, managed burns.\n\nEarly Florida pioneers would use fire to to clear undergrowth and fields.\n\nThe artform was lost at some point, but today prescribed burns are used by entities to maintain these ecosystems.\n\nCompton pointed to urban development being one factor, adding that the lands where the pines are is typically attractive to people. Homes aren't the only thing reducing habitat cover, conversion to agriculture and some types of forestry are also posing a threat.\n\nInvasive species such as cogongrass are also creating challenges. This grass is described as a \"novel fuel\" that increases fire intensities. While longleafs are fire-adapted, enough heat can still kill them.\n\nIncreasing frequencies and intensities of hurricanes and droughts due to climate change are also taking their toll. Although they may be more resilient than other pines, a strong hurricane can still flatten a mature longleaf ecosystem.\n\nAs humans push further and further into longleaf territory, it can also constrain where and when perscribed burns occur. The lack of fire can do serious damage to the forests over time.\n\nWhat are we doing to save the longleaf?\n\nMultiple groups are leading the charge to conserve lands containing longleaf pine ecosystems.\n\nConservation groups have been able to bring the range of the pine up to 5 million acres from its historic 3 million acre low.\n\nThe environmental advocates are also making resources available for property owners who want to get involved in preservation of the longleaf pine. Organizations such as America's Longleaf argue that landowners can make a profit off of creating the habitat through pine straw and timber.\n\nMeanwhile, replanting efforts have been underway. The Northwest Florida Water Management District celebrated planting their 20 millionth longleaf in 2022. Florida State Parks bragged that the nearby Torreya State Park restore about 350 acres of the ecosystem yearly.\n\nThe state recently finalized plans to create the new Sandy Creek State Forest that will preserve 12,243 acres in Bay, Calhoun, and Gulf counties. Some of the acreage contains longleaf pine habitat.\n\nIf this read has inspired you to go out and see one of these iconic pines for yourself, there could be one in your back yard. Readers can see an interactive map of the longleafs created by the Florida Forest Service.\n\nMore on the environment: This endangered crayfish only lives in Bay County, and it's been through some controversy\n\nThe largest concentration of the trees in Bay County is in Pine Log State Forest, (Florida's oldest state forest,) and state owned lands along Econfina Creek.\n\nThe highest concentration in the Florida panhandle can be found on the range of Eglin Air Force Base, Blackwater State Forest, the Apalachicola National Forest, and the water management areas around Econfina Creek.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The News Herald: You've seen this tree a thousand times, but its future is at risk",

      "text": "Keystone species are critical because entire ecosystems rely on their presence to remain balanced. If removed, the ecological structure may collapse. They differ from indicator species, which reflect the health and maturity of an ecosystem rather than supporting it directly.\nOne such keystone species in Florida is the Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris). This towering pine is a symbol of the Southeast\u2019s once vast pine grassland ecosystems.\nHistorically, Longleaf Pine forests covered over 90 million acres across the southeastern United States. Today. As of 2024, just over 5 million acres remain. This is just approximately 5 % of the original forest coverage. As researchers and land managers recognize their ecological importance, restoration efforts are gaining momentum, bringing attention to this resilient species.\nAmazing Fire Adaptations\nLongleaf Pines are uniquely adapted to fire, a natural and necessary process in their native habitats. Their life cycle includes distinct stages designed to protect the tree\u2019s growth point from heat damage:\nGrass Stage (Years 1\u20137):\nAppears as a tuft of long needles\nFocuses on building a deep root system\nNeedles insulate the apical meristem (growing tip) from fire\nBroom Stage:\nRapid vertical growth pushes growing tissue above typical fire height\nAllows the tree to mature without fire-related setbacks\nAdult Stage:\nGrows to heights of 60\u2013125 feet\nReaches full maturity at 100\u2013150 years\nBark becomes thick and flaky, shedding easily during fire events\nThese adaptations not only help the tree survive, but also allow fire to clear underbrush\u2014benefiting grasses, wildflowers, and wildlife that depend on open landscapes.\nPlant Identification\nMature trees are irregular in uniformity with an overall oval habit.\nNeedles are 8-14 inches long with 3 needles per fascicle. Occasional groups of only 2 needed will be found.\nFemale cones are 6-12 inches long.\nBark color includes brows, grey and orange in scaly plates.\nRed-Cockaded Woodpeckers Depend on Longleaf Pine trees\nAn iconic indicator species in mature Longleaf Pine forests is the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Endangered and highly selective in nesting habitat, this woodpecker prefers living trees\u2014especially those over 80 years old. Older Longleaf Pines often host heart rot fungus, which softens the interior wood and allows the birds to carve out nesting cavities.\nThese primary cavities then support other species, such as small mammals and insects, making the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker a secondary keystone species within this habitat.\nWhy Keystone Species Matter\nProtecting keystone species like the Longleaf Pine isn\u2019t just about preserving individual trees\u2014it\u2019s about conserving entire ecosystems. Once lost, keystone species are difficult\u2014and sometimes impossible\u2014to reintroduce. Their absence can trigger cascading effects throughout the food chain and alter the landscape\u2019s structure and function.\nRestoring Longleaf Pine forests is essential for safeguarding Florida\u2019s biodiversity, improving land resilience, and maintaining a healthy ecological legacy for future generations.\nFor planting or management advice, contact your local UF/IFAS Extension Office, and explore resources on ecosystem restoration through FFL Landscaping.\nAdditional Recourses: https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/ST469\nhttps://gardeningsolutions.ifas.ufl.edu/plants/trees-and-shrubs/trees/longleaf-pine/"

For example, prescribed burning is a widely used management tool for promoting longer-term resilience and sustainability in longleaf pine ecosystems of the southeastern United States, but regional stressors such as climatic warming, changing fire conditions, and an expanding wildland-urban interface may challenge its application. To facilitate the development of fire management strategies that account for such changes, we surveyed nearly 300 fire managers to elicit information on the criteria used for prioritizing burn sites, current burning practices and constraints, and expectations for changes in burning opportunities, including those pertaining to climate change and urban growth.\nResults\nRespondents noted that their most common criteria for selecting longleaf pine stands for burning were fire history, ecosystem health, and fuel reduction, with the presence of threatened and endangered species also given priority by public land managers. Many respondents (38%) cited recent burn frequencies that fall short of historic burn intervals. Barriers to burning included legal, institutional, and managerial constraints, such as proximity to human developments, public concerns, and risk aversion, as well as environmental and resource constraints, including weather, air quality restrictions, and lack of personnel, equipment, or funding. Roughly half of all respondents expect that opportunities to burn will be reduced over the next 30 years, particularly during the growing season. Fire manager perceptions of factors that will limit prescribed burning in the future include a similar suite of constraints, many of which will be affected by projected regional changes in land use and climate.\nConclusions\nOn an organizational level, burn window availability and resource limitations constrain prescribed burning practices. More broadly, policy and legal frameworks coupled with trends in urbanization and climate change are expected to interact with operational constraints to challenge managers\u2019 abilities to implement landscape-scale burning strategies and achieve restoration goals. Additional research and engagement with fire managers are needed to investigate opportunities for introducing policy flexibility, leveraging shared management interests, and developing creative solutions to expand burning opportunities.\nResumen\nAntecedentes\nLas trayectorias proyectadas de cambio clim\u00e1tico y cambios en el uso de la tierra sobre lo que resta del Siglo XXI puede resultar en condiciones y situaciones que requieren de aproximaciones flexibles para el planeamiento y pr\u00e1cticas de conservaci\u00f3n. Por ejemplo, las quemas prescriptas son una pr\u00e1ctica ampliamente usada como herramienta de manejo para promover la resiliencia y sostenibilidad a largo plazo en ecosistemas de pino de hoja larga (Pinus palustris) en el sudeste de los EEUU., aunque algunos estreses regionales como el calentamiento global, el cambio en las condiciones de los fuegos, y la expansi\u00f3n de la interfaz urbano-rural pueden dificultar su aplicaci\u00f3n. Para facilitar el desarrollo de estrategias de manejo que tengan en cuenta esos cambios, relevamos la opini\u00f3n de cerca de 300 gestores de fuegos para obtener informaci\u00f3n sobre los criterios usados para priorizar sitios de quema, las pr\u00e1cticas corrientes de quema y sus condicionantes, y las expectativas de cambio en las oportunidades de quema, incluyendo aquellas concernientes al cambio clim\u00e1tico y al crecimiento urbano.\nResultados\nLos respondientes notaron que el criterio m\u00e1s com\u00fan usado para seleccionar rodales de pino de hoja larga para efectuar quemas prescriptas fueron la historia de fuego, la salud del ecosistema y la reducci\u00f3n del combustible, a lo que se agreg\u00f3 la presencia de especies amenazadas y en peligro, a las que le dieron prioridad los agentes manejadores de tierras p\u00fablicas. Muchos de los respondientes (38%) citaron a la frecuencia de quemas recientes que estaban por debajo de los intervalos hist\u00f3ricos de quemas. Las barreras para las quemas incluyeron aspectos legales, institucionales, y condicionantes del manejo, como la proximidad a desarrollos urbanos, las preocupaciones del p\u00fablico en general, y la aversi\u00f3n al riesgo; tambi\u00e9n lo fueron condicionantes ambientales y de los recursos, incluyendo el tiempo meteorol\u00f3gico en el momento de la quema, las restricciones en cuanto a calidad del aire, y la falta de personal, de equipamiento, o de financiamiento. Alrededor de la mitad de todos los respondientes creen que la oportunidad de hacer estas quemas se reducir\u00e1 en los pr\u00f3ximos 30 a\u00f1os, especialmente durante la estaci\u00f3n de crecimiento. Las percepciones de los gestores de fuegos sobre los factores que limitar\u00e1n las quemas prescriptas en el futuro incluyen un conjunto similar de condicionantes, muchos de los cuales ser\u00e1n afectados por cambios regionales en el uso de la tierra y en el clima.\nConclusiones\nA nivel organizacional, la disponibilidad de ventanas de quemas y limitaciones en los recursos van a condicionar las pr\u00e1cticas de quema. De manera m\u00e1s amplia, las pol\u00edticas y el marco legal acoplados a la tendencia a la urbanizaci\u00f3n y el cambio clim\u00e1tico pareciera que interactuar\u00e1n como condicionantes operacionales que desafiaran las habilidades de los gestores para implementar estrategias de quema a escala de paisaje para alcanzar objetivos de restauraci\u00f3n. Investigaciones adicionales y el involucramiento con los gestores del fuego ser\u00e1 necesario para investigar oportunidades de introducir flexibilidad en las pol\u00edticas e influir sobre la posibilidad de compartir los intereses de manejo, y desarrollar soluciones creativas para expandir las oportunidades de quemas prescriptas.\nBackground\nLongleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystems are a prominent focus of conservation efforts in the southeastern United States following more than a century of losses to development, agriculture, conversion to industrial forest types, and altered disturbance regimes (Kirkman and Mitchell 2006; Oswalt et al. 2012). Even in extant stands, years of fire prevention and suppression have resulted in an increased abundance of midstory hardwoods (Provencher et al. 2001) and shrubs (Gilliam and Platt 1999; Freeman and Jose 2009), significantly altering the characteristic open-canopy structure that was maintained by frequent fires and supported high levels of vascular plant species richness. Reduced fire frequencies have also led to fuel buildup, increasing the potential for higher intensity fires (Varner et al. 2005). Collectively, the loss and alteration of these ecosystems have significant implications not only for longleaf pine, but also for associated endemic flora and fauna, including species of interest such as the red-cockaded woodpecker and gopher tortoise (Weiss et al. 2019; Hunter and Rostal 2021).\nPrescribed burning, used in conjunction with mechanical thinning and fuel reduction, herbicides, and planting, is a key management tool for restoring and managing longleaf pine ecosystems (Mitchell et al. 2006; Wolcott et al. 2007). America\u2019s Longleaf Restoration Initiative (ALRI), for example, called for burning 600,000 ha of longleaf ecosystems annually as part of its Range-Wide Conservation Plan (ALRI 2009). However, the widespread application of prescribed fire may be challenged by a suite of evolving regional stressors (Mitchell et al. 2014; Costanza et al. 2016). Human population density, rates of land use conversion, and extent of urban systems are all projected to increase dramatically in upcoming decades (Wear and Greis 2013; Terando et al. 2014), expanding the wildland-urban interface and altering the landscape context within which longleaf pine forests are embedded (Costanza et al. 2015; Radeloff et al. 2018). These ongoing threats will occur at a time when the region is expected to experience significant climatic changes that will affect species and ecosystems in complex ways (Carter et al. 2018). Changes in climate will also impact fire weather, altering wildfire regimes (Gao et al. 2021) and narrowing the available window for setting prescribed fires (Kupfer et al. 2020) in a region where more than 3 million ha are burned annually to reduce wildfire risks and achieve a range of ecological and economic objectives (Melvin 2020).\nBroadly speaking, it is recognized that flexible approaches that consider how conservation planning, practices, and policies can be adapted to incorporate future environmental changes are needed to address many of the most pressing future challenges in species and ecosystem management (Golladay et al. 2016; Rissman et al. 2018; Lynch et al. 2021; Simpson et al. 2021). With respect to prescribed fire in longleaf pine ecosystems, there is a need for more information on the factors that shape current burning decisions and how fire managers expect those factors to change in the upcoming decades. Costanza and Moody (2011), for example, argued that more knowledge about how managers prioritize sites for burning and the factors that constrain prescribed burning is particularly needed to understand the potential longer-term consequences of fire management and facilitate effective management practices.\nPast research has identified a suite of criteria that may influence practitioner decisions concerning which stands to prioritize for burning; these criteria include both ecological (e.g., ecosystem health of a site; the presence of threatened or endangered species) and non-ecological (e.g., presence of existing firebreaks; management objectives for timber or game) factors (Table 1). Similarly, researchers have identified potential impediments to prescribed burning that range from factors associated with legal, institutional, and managerial constraints to those associated with environmental conditions and resource availability (Table 2). While these criteria and constraints are intuitive and have been cited in longleaf pine management guides, few studies have specifically sought to quantify their relative importance via direct input from fire managers, especially across the full historic range of longleaf pine. Furthermore, efforts to adapt fire management programs to address projected changes in climate, fire weather, and land use over the remainder of the century will likely require managers to consider creative (and even novel) actions and strategies to maintain current levels of prescribed fire, let alone expand it. There is, however, relatively little information on how fire managers perceive the implications of such changes for conservation goals and actions.\nGiven this context, we surveyed nearly 300 fire managers across the Southeast to elicit baseline information on the goals, practices, and challenges associated with their longleaf pine prescribed burning programs. We then used a mixed-methods approach involving quantitative and qualitative analyses of survey responses to address three questions: (1) What are the most common criteria that practitioners use to decide where to burn to achieve management objectives in their longleaf pine ecosystems? (2) What are the primary factors that constrain the implementation of prescribed burning in their management units? (3) How do managers expect burning constraints and the availability of suitable burning conditions to change over the next 30\u201350 years? For the first two questions, we tested for differences in criteria and constraints, whether responses differed between managers responsible for burning on public vs. private lands, and whether responses differed between the states across the historic range of longleaf pine. For the third question, we analyzed responses regarding the factors that managers believe will be most constraining in upcoming decades and explored their perceptions about the potential effects of projected regional changes in land use and climate. In doing so, this study contributes a first look at how fire managers themselves believe changing conditions could challenge their ability to fully achieve existing conservation goals and objectives in longleaf pine ecosystems. We conclude by discussing this study\u2019s implications for the design and implementation of burning strategies that consider important evolving regional stressors.\nMethods\nFire manager surveys\nWe developed a Qualtrics web-based survey for fire managers working with longleaf pine ecosystems to learn more about their criteria for prioritizing burn sites, current burning practices, factors that constrain their ability to conduct prescribed burns at desired locations and times, and expectations of how climate change and urban growth may affect those factors in the future. We asked specifically about factors related to weather conditions, site conditions, and various legal, institutional, and managerial constraints identified in previous research, as noted in Tables 1 and 2. The survey consisted of 25 questions, including 6 open-ended response questions that allowed managers to provide more detailed comments. To ensure that the question phrasing, format, and survey flow were appropriate for our target audience, co-author Hiers, Director of Fire Science Applications, and another fire applications specialist associated with Tall Timbers Research Station reviewed the draft survey and consulted on strategies for improvement.\nThe survey was deployed in July 2019 and remained open through September. The survey invitation asked for participation from fire managers specifically working with longleaf pine ecosystems and was distributed by two organizations supporting fire management professionals. The Southern Fire Exchange, a wildland fire science communication program that represents states encompassing the historic range of longleaf pine (Fig. 1), circulated the survey in mid-July as an article with a weblink in Fire Lines, their bimonthly newsletter, and then as a standalone email with a weblink to the same list in early August. Fire Lines has approximately 3000 subscribers, many of whom work with longleaf pine in some way. In early August, the Southeast Regional Partnership for Planning and Sustainability (SERPPAS) circulated the invitation to the southern prescribed fire community via the Driptorch Digest, their monthly e-newsletter, which has roughly 250 subscribers.\nOverall, we received 296 responses that included answers to at least some questions; of those respondents, a majority (206) fully completed the survey and included their state and land ownership class, which differentiated those primarily responsible for managing fire on public lands (including federal, state, and local levels) from those managing private lands, including individual landholders, corporations, and NGOs. If we consider the entire distribution lists for Fire Lines and Driptorch Digest (n = 3250), the corresponding response rates would be 9.1% for partially completed surveys and 6.3% for those providing their state and land ownership class. Calculating exact response rates is difficult, however, because the outlet memberships include fire managers who do not manage longleaf pine stands and thus would not be part of the potential survey pool. Our respondent group included managers from a diverse range of management and ownership types (public lands: n = 118; private lands: n = 89) and states, albeit with fewer responses from Louisiana (n = 8), Texas (n = 9), and Virginia (n = 4) (see Additional file 1: Table A1, for more detailed respondent demographics). Respondents reported varying tenures in their current management positions (minimum = 0.5 years, maximum = 53 years), with a median of 10 years and over three-fourths (77.4%) serving five or more years in their current position.\nWe disseminated the survey through the Southern Fire Exchange and SERPPAS newsletters because both organizations are trusted and known in the longleaf pine management space and offered the best opportunity to reach professionals throughout the region. However, we acknowledge several limitations with using this convenience sampling approach and advise that while our results offer additional insight into constraints on prescribed burning practices and emerging concerns for achieving longleaf pine restoration goals, further research throughout the region is needed to elaborate and verify these findings and to investigate the causes and potential solutions to these constraints. First, while these distribution lists include a broad constituency, we cannot know for certain whether those lists were representative of all regional fire managers, defined here as individuals who plan and implement prescribed burns and have responsibility for specific management units. Second, the list likely includes individuals who do not serve in a fire manager role. Although we indicated the survey was intended for individuals who \u201cmanage prescribed burns on longleaf pine units,\u201d for those respondents who did not provide information about their state, management unit, and other demographic information, their role as fire managers cannot be certain. For the statistical analyses, we addressed this limitation by including only those respondents who provided state and management information. For other analyses, we assumed that respondents were involved in fire or longleaf pine management in a professional capacity due to their membership in the Southern Fire Exchange or SERPPAS lists and decided to use their responses. Some respondents may have experiences in fire suppression or other management activities that might contribute to variability in professional judgment, but these possibilities were accepted as part of the diversity within the population and not pursued in the survey design. In terms of survey participation, the timing unfortunately corresponded to the summer fire season, a period when some fire managers serve on fire details supporting other units and regions, which may have decreased the response rate. Additionally, the detailed nature of some questions may also have affected the response and completion rates by requiring too much time of, or information not readily available to, the respondents.\nData analysis\nCriteria for prioritizing burn sites within a management unit\nManagers were first asked to indicate their top three criteria for determining whether a site (e.g., stand, burn unit) within their management unit (e.g., National Forest, private land holding) had a high priority for burning given a list of factors associated with site conditions, fire history, proximity to developed areas, and potential management goals (see Table 1). Responses were coded as a binary variable for analysis (1 = selected; 0 = not selected) and analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM: Agresti 2012). Criteria served as a repeated measures factor to distinguish individual criteria, while the management class (public vs. private: PubPriv) and state (State) were observational factors. Here, and elsewhere, all analyses that included PubPriv and State were based on responses only from managers who provided that information (n = 206). The response was modeled as a binomial random variable with a logistic link function assuming the conditional form of the GLMM. Simultaneous pairwise comparisons of least square means (LSMEANS) were computed using a Tukey-Kramer procedure to explore significant results, and criteria with values that were not significantly different were placed into groups to facilitate the interpretation of the pairwise comparisons. All models were analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS Studio 9.4, unless otherwise noted.\nConstraints to prescribed burning\nWe next asked managers to rate how often a set of factors served as constraints to prescribed burning at their units using three possible responses: \u201cNot a Constraint,\u201d \u201cOccasionally a Constraint,\u201d or \u201cRegularly a Constraint.\u201d For both the survey and analysis, we placed constraints into one of two categories to reflect the different ways and time frames at which they affect decisions: (1) legal, institutional, and managerial constraints, including those associated with risk, liability, legal requirements, and partnerships, and (2) environmental and resource constraints, including aspects of weather, atmospheric conditions, and the availability of personnel and equipment (Table 2). The legal, institutional, and managerial constraints capture factors that bound a fire manager\u2019s decision context, for example, constraints that are rooted in long-term management objectives or settings, or that involve legal mandates or agreements with other stakeholders. Environmental and resource constraints, on the other hand, primarily relate to conditions associated with operational (i.e., near real-time) decisions on whether to burn or not.\nUnlike the legal, institutional, and managerial constraints, the environmental and resource constraints have distinctly seasonal components in that factors may be constraints during some seasons but not others. For example, weather variables that define prescription burn windows in the Southeast vary seasonally (e.g., Chiodi et al. 2018), as does the availability of personnel and equipment to conduct prescribed fires. Therefore, we asked managers to provide ratings for each of the environmental and resource constraints for four seasons defined by longleaf pine phenology: (a) the dormant season, the period of slowest growth before longleaf pine growth increases to spring and summer levels; (b) the candling season, the early spring growth period before protective needles have developed around the growing buds; (c) the growing season, the primary period of late spring and summer growth; and (d) the senescing season, the autumnal period during which tree growth slows. Because calendar dates for longleaf pine phenology vary over its range in the Southeast, managers were asked to provide approximate start dates for each of these four seasonal periods and to respond to all questions using those seasons to guide their responses.\nFor the statistical analyses, we converted responses into a binary variable that distinguished those in which the factor is not a constraint (value = 0) from those in which it is occasionally or regularly a constraint (value = 1). For the legal, institutional, and managerial constraints, we used a GLMM with a binary logistic link, with Constraint serving as a repeated measures factor for the criteria and PubPriv and State as observational factors. For the environmental and resource constraints, Season served as an additional repeated measures factor to distinguish the two phenological seasons in which most prescribed burning of longleaf pine stands occurs, the dormant and growing seasons. We chose not to include the candling and senescing seasons in these analyses because prescribed burning is less commonly conducted during these two seasons.\nBeyond quantifying the overall importance of weather as an environmental constraint, we wanted to identify which weather variables served as the greatest operational constraints to burning during the dormant and growing seasons to better understand current burning practices and because previous work has projected that changes in the number of suitable burning days will be more closely linked to some weather variables than others (Kupfer et al. 2020). We asked managers to indicate whether each variable was a common constraint to implementation of prescribed burns during each season (coded as 1 = constraint during that season and 0 = not a constraint). Provided constraints included high and low temperatures, high and low relative humidity, high and low wind speeds, days since the last measurable rainfall, drought conditions, low atmospheric dispersion index values, and the presence of strong transport winds. The result was a set of binary variables indicating whether the weather variable of interest was a common constraint in that season (value = 1) or not (value = 0). Analyses used a comparable approach to that used to evaluate environmental and resource constraints.\nFuture changes in burning opportunities\nThe final set of quantitative analyses focused on managers\u2019 perceptions of future changes in constraints to, and opportunities for, prescribed burning of longleaf pine stands. We first asked managers how they expect the availability of suitable burning opportunities to change in each burn season given a 30-year planning horizon. The response scale was ordinal: 1 = greatly reduced, 2 = somewhat reduced, 3 = no significant change, 4 = somewhat increased, and 5 = greatly increased. We then asked them to identify the most important constraints that they believe will limit their use of prescribed burning for the same time period. Respondents could select up to five constraints from the list used previously (Table 2) or add their own. We recorded individual responses for each constraint using a simple binary scale (0 = not selected; 1 = selected). As with earlier analyses, we used a mixed binomial model with Manager as a random effect and PubPriv, State, and an 11-level variable (FutConstr) distinguishing the various constraints as a repeated measures factor.\nFinally, we asked managers to rate how they think changes in future urbanization patterns (e.g., changes in the wildland-urban interface, loss of habitat to restore longleaf pine ecosystems) and climate (e.g., increasing temperature, more intense rainstorms and extreme weather events) will affect their prescribed burning decisions. Possible responses were again ordinal (1 = not at all; 2 = a little; 3 = moderately; 4 = a great deal), with an additional option of \u201cDon\u2019t Know.\u201d Because responses would likely vary with the time frame, managers were asked to provide ratings for three future time horizons: the next 5\u201310 years, 10\u201330 years, and 30\u201350 years.\nQualitative analyses\nFor the open-ended questions, we used a qualitative data analysis software program, NVivo 12, to analyze the text responses and provide context to managers\u2019 prescribed burning decisions. Initial coding categories aligned with the prescribed burning criteria (Table 1) and constraints (Table 2) posed in the survey and evaluated in the statistical analyses. Sub-categories were added when the text provided new details about burning criteria and constraints or when respondents discussed additional factors that affect their burning decisions. Individual responses could be coded at multiple categories, depending on the response content. Once the data were coded, we conducted a series of queries to compare differences between management types and explore intersections between the different survey questions and codes. Of the fully or partially completed surveys (n = 296), 162 contained responses to one or more open-ended questions and were reviewed during the qualitative coding. Of those 162, 148 contained demographic data (83 public land managers, 65 private land managers).\nResults\nWhen asked how often longleaf pine stands in their management units should be burned, nearly all respondents (98.8%) cited a frequency of 1\u20134 years, a value that corresponds to the historic fire regime in longleaf pine ecosystems (cf. Glitzenstein et al. 2003; Rother et al. 2020). However, when asked how frequently longleaf pine stands in their units have been burned over the last decade (on average), many respondents (38.5%) gave values ranging from 4 years to never within that time span. Even managers who cited recent burn frequencies of 4 years or less noted that they are not burning as often as they would like to meet management goals. These responses underscore the importance of understanding the factors that shape prescribed burning decisions.\nCriteria for prioritizing burn sites within management units\nBased only on data from respondents who provided both their management class and state (n=206), the GLMM of burn criteria indicated significant differences in how often individual criteria were cited (Criteria: DF = 8; Den DF = 1632; F = 48.53; p \u2264 0.0001), but no differences for PubPriv (p = 0.38) or State (p = 1.00). There was, however, a highly significant interaction between Criteria and PubPriv (DF = 8; Den DF = 1632; F = 5.11; p \u2264 0.0001). While analysis of a main effect in the presence of significant interactions should be undertaken with caution, pairwise comparisons of LSMEANS for Criteria identified several discrete groups of burn criteria. These groups, listed in descending order of importance, were formed by TimeSinceBurn and EcoHealth (group A) and FuelReduction and TandE (group B), with two overlapping groups formed by Firebreaks, WUI, ExoticInvasive, OtherCrit (group C) and ExoticInvasive, OtherCrit, and Timber (group D) (Table 3). A majority of respondents cited time since the last burn (76.4%) and ecosystem health (67.5%) as top priorities, followed by fuel reduction (48.5%) and management for threatened and endangered species (39.9%). Other priorities were selected by fewer than 20% of respondents.\nThe significant interaction indicates that the Criteria groupings were affected by whether a respondent managed private or public lands. For private lands, two distinct, non-overlapping groups of criteria emerged. The first group of more cited criteria included TimeSinceBurn, EcoHealth, and FuelReduction; the second group contained ExoticInvasive, TandE, WUI, Firebreaks, OtherCrit, and Timber. For public lands, five groups with often overlapping variables were identified; these included TimeSinceBurn and EcoHealth in the group of most cited criteria, followed (in descending order) by groups consisting of EcoHealth and TandE; TandE and FuelReduction; FireBreaks, WUI, ExoticInvasive, and OtherCrit; and WUI, ExoticInvasive, OtherCrit, and Timber. The presence of threatened and endangered species was thus given higher priority on public lands compared to private lands (53.9% vs. 21.4% of respondents; Table 3) while fuel reduction appeared in the highest grouping for private, but not public, lands. There were no statistically significant differences among states, suggesting that respondents across the region use similar criteria for site prioritization.\nLegal, institutional, and managerial constraints\nThe most common legal, institutional, and managerial constraints to burning were the presence of human developments (WUI) and risk aversion (Risk), with over 70% of respondents citing those factors as regular or occasional constraints (Fig. 2). Avoiding public concerns over burning (PublicConcern), legal constraints (Legal), challenges posed by partnerships and agreements (Partner), and limited incentives to burn (Incentives) served as occasional constraints but were each cited as regular constraints by fewer than 15% of respondents.\nQuantitatively, the GLMM found significant differences based on the individual constraints (Constraint: DF = 5; Den DF = 971; F = 31.21; p \u2264 0.0001) and state (State: DF = 8; Den DF = 971; F = 2.18; p \u2264 0.027), as well as a weakly significant interaction between Constraint and PubPriv (DF = 5; Den DF = 971; F = 2.17; p = 0.055). The significant State-level effect was due to differences between Virginia, on the one hand, and North Carolina and Mississippi, on the other; however, this result is likely trivial because of the small sample size from Virginia (n = 4). For private land managers, follow-up tests of the interaction effect identified a distinct group containing WUI and Risk as the most common legal, institutional, and managerial constraints to burning, with overlapping secondary groups formed by PublicConcern, Legal, and Partner in one group and Partner and Incentives in another. For public land managers, WUI and Risk again formed a group of the most cited constraints, with an overlapping second group containing Risk and PublicConcern followed by a distinct secondary group containing Partner, Incentives, and Legal. Collectively, these results indicate that the most common constraints (nearby development, risk aversion, and liability) were the same for all managers, but public land managers more often cited avoiding public concerns over the use of burning as a constraint, while legal constraints were more often cited by private land managers.\nEnvironmental and resource constraints\nAll four environmental and resource constraints were commonly cited as regular or occasional constraints to burning, but there were statistically significant differences between the constraints (DF = 3; Den DF = 1211; F = 6.27; p = 0.0003) and the two seasons (DF = 1; Den DF = 1211; F = 14.85; p = <0.0001) (Fig. 3). Tests of pairwise differences identified three overlapping groups (in descending order of importance) formed by Weather and Resources, Resources and AirQuality, and AirQuality and FuelLoad and indicated that constraints were more common during the growing season than the dormant season. There were no differences for PubPriv (p = 0.80) or State (p = 0.31) and no significant interaction effects.\nFor the individual weather constraints, the results indicated significant fixed effects related to the different constraints (WxConstr: DF = 9; Den DF = 3885; F = 22.06; p < 0.0001) and a significant interaction between WxConstr and Season (DF = 9; Den DF = 3885; F = 28.85; p < 0.0001), meaning that that some meteorological variables were more commonly cited as being constraints and that the importance of constraints varied seasonally. The frequency of respondents citing specific meteorological variables as regular constraints also provided perspective on available burn windows in the dormant versus growing seasons (Fig. 4). During the growing season, high temperatures, drought, and days since the last rainfall were the most frequently cited weather limitations, followed by high relative humidity and low wind speeds (Fig. 5: note that vertical bars connect constraints with statistically equivalent values). Variables associated with heat and fuel moisture were thus central in restricting burn opportunities during the hottest time of the year. Two of the main growing season constraints were also in the top group of dormant season constraints (drought, days since the last rainfall), but the other dormant season constraints in the highest group were low relative humidity, high wind speeds, and atmospheric dispersal. Growing season constraints thus reflected a greater emphasis on hotter stagnant conditions and their influence on fire control, crew safety, and smoke transport than dormant season constraints.\nFuture changes in burning opportunities and constraints\nRoughly half of the respondents expected that the availability of suitable burning opportunities will be reduced (either greatly or somewhat) over the next 30 years, with the greatest percentages noted for the growing (53.5%) and candling (53.8%) seasons (Table 4). In contrast, few foresee increased prescribed burning opportunities in any season.\nIn terms of potential future constraints, there was a significant difference in the number of managers citing specific factors (FutConstr: DF = 10; Den DF = 2050; F = 39.39; p < 0.0001), but no differences between those managing public vs. private lands (p = 0.42) or those in different states (p = 0.34). Pairwise comparisons illustrated the differences in how respondents view such constraints, with resulting groups (in descending order of importance) formed by AirQuality and WUI (group A); Risk, PublicConcern, and Weather (group B); PublicConcern, Weather, and Resources (group C); Resources and Legal (group D), Legal and FuelLoad (group E), and Incentives and Partners (group F) (Table 5). The most cited future constraints thus included a diverse mix of legal, institutional, managerial, and environmental constraints, most (if not all) of which would likely be affected by projected changes in land use, urbanization, and climate.\nWhen managers were asked to rate how they think future changes in land use and urbanization patterns will affect prescribed burning decisions, the percentage who responded \u201cA Great Deal\u201d rose from 25.7% over the next 5\u201310 years to 62.5% for 30\u201350 years into the future (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the percentage of managers who responded \u201cNot at all\u201d or \u201cA little\u201d dropped from 39.8 to 9.8% for the same periods. These responses signal a clear expectation among fire managers that changes in human land uses, for example growth of the wildland-urban interface, will increasingly affect prescribed fire programs in upcoming decades.\nA similar pattern emerged when respondents were asked to rate the degree to which they expect future climate change to affect prescribed burn opportunities (Fig. 6B). In this case, the percentage who responded \u201cA Great Deal\u201d increased from 5.9% over the next 5\u201310 years to 44.8% for 30\u201350 years into the future, while the percentage who responded \u201cNot at all\u201d or \u201cA little\u201d dropped from 56.5 to 15.9%. However, more than twice as many respondents were uncertain about the impacts of climate change on prescribed burning in the next 30\u201350 years (27.5%), when compared with changes in land use and urbanization (9.8%).\nQualitative results: interactions among stressors and constraints\nNarrative responses reinforced the quantitative results by highlighting key factors that influence prescribed burning decisions as well as the interactions among factors that contribute to the insufficient burn frequencies reported by many respondents. Regarding the prioritization of burn sites, twenty-eight respondents (8 public; 17 private; 3 not specified) provided narrative comments. Their responses were mostly associated with the EcoHealth, FuelReduction, and Firebreaks survey criteria. Respondents particularly noted the importance of reducing competing species and promoting longleaf pine growth, especially to support restoration objectives, and considering both a site\u2019s fuel conditions and the ability to conduct safe burns in the decision process. For other criteria (OtherCrit), respondents listed client interests, contractual obligations, and management objectives related to hunting and quail habitat.\nWith respect to current constraints, 153 respondents (81 public; 59 private; 13 not specified) submitted additional comments. After weather- and resource-related factors (cited by 52.9% and 49.7% of the 153 respondents, respectively), urban growth emerged as an additional, but less commonly cited, challenge, with 19% of respondents stating that development affected when and where they can burn and 18.3% mentioning smoke management in developed areas as a common constraint. Although fewer respondents elaborated on future burning opportunities and constraints (24 total: 9 public; 14 private;1 not specified), factors related to land use change and urbanization patterns were the most prevalent among the coded responses. Fourteen respondents cited development in the wildland-urban interface and changing landowner incentives and objectives as future burning constraints. In contrast, only three respondents specifically mentioned climate change-related issues.\nThere was also a high percentage of narrative content coded under multiple categories (150, or 92.6%, of the 162 surveys available for qualitative analysis), illuminating the complex nature of prescribed burning decisions (Table 6). For example, 46 reports (28.4% of the total) referenced both weather and resources as affecting burn decisions, and 31 of the 36 surveys referencing human development and presence of the wildland-urban interface were jointly coded with the smoke and smoke management, weather, resources, political and policy issues, and risk aversion categories. The ability to meet air quality requirements, avoid public concerns, and hence meet management objectives is subject to myriad, interacting stressors, as illustrated by the example quotes.\nAs a whole, the qualitative results suggested that most managers currently work to optimize the resources and opportunities they have, yet the multi-layered set of challenges they face appear to make it difficult to maintain desired burn regimes. To address expectations that these challenges will continue, and likely increase, into the future, several respondents suggested actions or mitigation opportunities to pursue. These recommendations pertain to public education, insurance reform, and improving understanding of the economic benefits of prescribed burning. Other comments focused on altering fire management practices, such as by expanding burn windows, taking advantage of burning opportunities in non-traditional seasons, and considering strategies such as mechanical thinning or herbicides to supplement burning.\nDiscussion\nPriorities and constraints to prescribed burning in longleaf pine ecosystems\nHigh rates of population growth, urbanization, and land use change coupled with projected changes in climate pose a significant threat to regional biodiversity in the southeastern United States (Carter et al. 2018). These drivers of change are common in many terrestrial ecosystems across the globe, but in landscapes with pyrophilic systems, they compound the complexity of managing beneficial prescribed fires (Vose et al. 2021). Longleaf pine ecosystems illustrate many of the design and implementation challenges associated with the development of longer-term management strategies in the context of anthropogenic threats and stressors. Prescribed burning is widely considered to be one of the most important and effective tools for achieving rangewide conservation goals in these ecosystems (ALRI 2009), but supporting restoration through prescribed fire may require new approaches to burning as well as additional resources and policy changes to achieve desired goals (McIntyre et al. 2018). Drawing on results from a survey of longleaf pine fire managers, the purpose of this research was to provide information on the key criteria considered by practitioners when planning prescribed fires, the perceived constraints to the active use of manager-ignited fire, and beliefs about how such constraints are likely to change in the future.\nResources for conducting prescribed burns are frequently insufficient to manage lands for all conservation and resource management objectives, creating the need to prioritize the application of fire across a landscape within any given year (Hiers et al. 2003). Our results indicate that the most common criteria for selecting specific longleaf pine stands for burning were fire history, ecosystem health, and fuel reduction, with slight differences in secondary factors between public vs. private land managers (Table 3). The effective use of prescribed fire in longleaf pine ecosystems also requires understanding the constraints that factor into burning decisions. Here, fire managers cited the proximity of human development near burn units, weather, risk aversion, the availability of personnel and equipment, and issues associated with air quality as the most common constraints affecting prescribed burning. These results generally align with those from previous surveys in the southeastern United States and elsewhere that have examined prescribed burning objectives, priorities, and practices (Cleaves et al. 2000; Haines et al. 2001; Costanza and Moody 2011; Quinn-Davidson and Varner 2012; Kobziar et al. 2015; Melvin 2018).\nBeyond these individual constraints, though, our findings support the idea that factors occurring on a variety of spatial and temporal scales may interact to affect a manager\u2019s ability to take advantage of burning opportunities. For instance, suitable weather conditions are needed for a manager to safely burn, but these conditions must align with organizational capacity (e.g., staffing, funding, costs, equipment availability). Similarly, the ability to adhere to air quality and smoke management requirements that were identified in the qualitative coding intersects with available weather conditions and organizational capacity (Table 6). Uncovering the existence of such interactions requires, in part, an examination of seasonal patterns in burn constraints, especially if longer-term strategies seek to utilize shifts in the seasonal timing of burns to meet conservation objectives. For example, drought and days since rain were important considerations regardless of season, but other variables, particularly those associated with temperature, differed between seasons (Figs. 4 and 5). Several respondents even noted how extreme weather events and seasonal or annual weather variability (e.g., changes associated with ENSO, the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation), can disrupt plans for prescribed burning and force managers to adapt to either expanding or contracting burning opportunities on a seasonal basis.\nUnderstanding the intersection between legal, institutional, and managerial constraints that frame fire management with operational factors such as weather and organizational capacity that dictate day-to-day decisions is important not only for understanding current fire management practices, however. In this respect, our survey extends work from previous studies by explicitly asking managers to consider prospective constraints to their burn programs and how they may be affected by climate change and landscape transformation. Survey results articulate manager concerns about the future of prescribed burning in longleaf pine ecosystems, with roughly half of all respondents expecting reduced seasonal availability of suitable burning opportunities over the next 30 years (Table 4) due to issues associated with air quality, development in or near burn areas, risk aversion, and inappropriate weather conditions (Table 5). These factors themselves have direct linkages to climate change and human land use and development.\nDesign and implementation of future-looking burning strategies\nOur results hold several implications for the design and implementation of fire management strategies that consider current and evolving threats to longleaf pine ecosystems. First, inadequate resources and organizational capacity to implement burning even under current conditions imply that achieving existing goals and objectives in the future will be increasingly challenging. The qualitative analysis suggests that most managers currently work to optimize the resources and opportunities that they have, yet many sites are still falling behind prescribed burning needs. The quantitative analyses, in turn, provide manager-contributed data regarding the perceived importance of various constraints. Collectively, these results suggest that managers consider evolving interactions between burn priorities and constraints, such as changes involving agency policies or burning practices, as they seek to navigate shrinking burn window opportunities (e.g., Quinn-Davidson and Varner 2012; Kupfer et al. 2020).\nWe also posit that the (re)evaluation of longleaf pine restoration actions and goals should consider the interactive effects of urbanization and climate change on a manager\u2019s ability to meet prescribed burning objectives. Even under current conditions, many fire managers find it difficult to maintain desired burn regimes due to a mix of environmental, resource, legal, institutional, and managerial constraints. If climate change further narrows the availability of suitable burning conditions, managers may need to consider alternative burning approaches (e.g., burning at different times or in different seasons) or the increased use of more expensive mechanical or chemical options to meet future management goals (Provencher et al. 2001). Projected patterns of urbanization would impose an additional challenge to longleaf pine fire management as more stands are brought into an expanding wildland-urban interface (Costanza et al. 2015). Effectively addressing these intertwined challenges will be critical because any reduction in prescribed burning is likely to result in decreased biological diversity and could contribute to increased wildfires and, with that, the potential to threaten human developments and negatively influence regional air quality (Mitchell et al. 2014).\nFinally, our findings suggest that a broader re-evaluation of longleaf pine conservation goals and approaches may be needed in light of ongoing, and likely increasing, prescribed burning constraints. Increasing the use of prescribed burning underpins the larger suite of strategies intended to support long-term goals of increasing longleaf pine acreage and advancing the ecosystem\u2019s restoration. Effectively doing so may require building on existing or forging new collaborative strategies to create fire-adapted communities and landscapes that place fuels and forest health treatments in the right places and at the pace and scale needed to change the trajectory of wildfire risk to people, communities, and natural resources and to restore forest health and resilience (US Forest Service 2022). The need to engage with private landholders may be particularly acute given that (1) privately owned and managed lands account for over 60% of all longleaf pine acreage but only 24.3% of the acreage burned in 2020 (ALRI 2021) and (2) decisions for private land objectives may seek to minimize short-term risks, such as avoiding areas in which fire would be more difficult to manage, which has implications for burning (Costanza et al. 2013). In short, it is important to consider and reevaluate whether existing conservation goals, objectives, and approaches are still adequate or appropriate given the expected trajectories of climate and land use change (Stein and Shaw 2013).\nRecommendations and conclusions\nFire managers represent a valuable, yet largely untapped, source of perspective on the potential effects of evolving regional stressors on prescribed burning in longleaf pine ecosystems. Our survey results suggest that the design and implementation of future burning strategies for the long-term restoration of longleaf pine ecosystems should consider three key (but interrelated) issues to be successful. First, while prescribed burning in these systems often focuses on achieving broader restoration objectives, other goals and objectives are also at play, including burning to reduce wildfire risks or to achieve objectives related to private uses, such as hunting, esthetics, and timber. Successful approaches and planning will need to consider interactions between an array of conservation goals and objectives that may, or may not, be compatible.\nSecond, because land ownership and management in the southeastern United States is fragmented, there is a need for shared visions and fire management strategies that cross jurisdictions and ownership types. The degree to which conservation goals, objectives, and priorities in individual units are aligned will be important, as that affects how complex climate and land use stressors can be addressed on a regional or landscape level (e.g., Foster et al. 2019). Our results identified some differences in responses between managers working on public versus private lands, yet fire managers across the region used broadly similar criteria for site prioritization and identified many of the same constraints to their burn programs. Points of concurrence could serve as a means for increasing collaboration among interested parties and for finding creative solutions to maintaining, or even expanding, prescribed fire within the region.\nThird, fire management strategies need to account for the time scales of multiple constraints. This would include identifying and articulating relationships between operational constraints and capacities (e.g., staffing, weather, logistics), slower-moving institutions (e.g., best practices, policy and legal frameworks), and long-term environmental trends (e.g., land use and climate change). A key question is whether decisions made in current environments reinforce longleaf pine risks and vulnerabilities by limiting future flexibility, choices, and ability to adapt or achieve restoration goals.\nIn conclusion, this study identified multiple layers of constraints to prescribed burning in longleaf pine ecosystems that occur at intersecting temporal, spatial, and decision scales (see also Becknell et al. 2015; Gillson et al. 2019). Managers\u2019 expectations that land use change and climate will pose even greater limitations with an increase in future uncertainty poses practical challenges to regional landscape restoration efforts. Given the importance of prescribed burning as a tool for longleaf pine restoration, additional research and policy flexibility may help managers and organizations optimize the (changing) windows of burning opportunities, explore other management strategies, and/or reconsider the attainability of existing restoration goals.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe dataset analyzed in the current study, excluding information that could be used to identify individual respondents, is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAgresti, A. 2012.

If you haven't worked any mapping websites, operation might not be obvious to you. To help you scale this short (we hope) learning curve, we have compiled this list of common tasks. We also encourage you to explore. Move the mouse around and try clicking on things. Don't worry, you won't break anything.\nNote that this is an interactive guide. You can keep it on the screen while you try our suggestions. To move this guide to the side of the screen, just click and drag the heading of the popup window to wherever you want it.\nLet's get started!\nNavigation\nChances are, you aren't interested in the area we present to you by default. If you chose not to block your location, the default area will be your current location, or more specifically, the location of your Internet provider. Otherwise, you will be dropped off in Tempe, Arizona where our headquarters is located.\nTo move the map, drag it by clicking and holding down the left mouse button (or only mouse button if on a Mac.) With the mouse button pressed over the map, move the mouse and the map will pan. Go ahead and try it now.\nThat's all well and good you say, but the world is a big place. Panning to Fargo, North Dakota from Yuma, Arizona might take awhile. There's an easier way... see that text box in the upper left of the viewer with the text 'geo coordinates or street address'? Click on that text box and type Fargo, North Dakota, then click the 'go' button to the right, or press the [Enter] key. Your map should now display with a center location in Fargo, North Dakota.\nThe text search box works for street addresses, cities, and even landmarks. Try searching for Mount Rushmore.\nZoom\nOn the upper left side of the viewer content area are the zoom controls, indicated by the plus (+) and minus (-) sign. To zoom in, click on the plus, to zoom out, click on the minus.\nAerials\nMaps are used for orientation, and we don't deviate from their utility. However, you likely came here to view some historic aerial imagery, not to view maps, right?\nTo view the aerial view of the current map location, you need to select an aerial year to display. Click on the aerials button in the top left of the viewer. You should see a list of years pop out to the right. These are the years of aerial coverage that we currently have for the area indicated by center point of the map. To select a year, just click on the year you want to see. The current year will now display under the aerials button and within a couple seconds, the imagery for that year will replace the map.\nTo select another year, click on the aerials button again and select a different year. Note that you can pan around, or zoom like we did with the map.\nTopographic Maps\nReady for this? You already know how to view topographic maps. That's right, it works just like the aerial selection. Just click on the topos button and select the year you wish to view.\nAtlases\nLike the aerials and topos selectors, the atlases will let you view additional historical representations of the viewing area. We have geo-referenced digitized versions of historic maps and property boundary documents. This is also where you can select the map layer if you so desire. Note that our atlas selection is rather scarce as we are currently working on this arduous task.\nCompare\nYou may have noticed that only one 'layer' (whether that be an aerial, topo, or atlas) can be displayed at one time. To provide you with the ability to compare two different years (or layers,) you can use one of the compare utilities. To activate, click on the compare button.\nYou'll see four icons:\nturn compare off\nview specific area in circle\ncompare two layers side by side\nset transparency between layers\nTry clicking on the slider. Click on the compare button followed by the side-by-side option. On the right side of the screen a selector will appear similar to the left side. When you are comparing two layers, think right and left side.\nThe map is the default layer for both sides. Go ahead and select an aerial year on the right side that is different from the left. The slider on top of the viewing area allows you to move the demarcation line between the two layers.\nTo turn the compare tool off, click on the compare button on the left, and click on the X icon. Poof! The right layer and associated selectors disappear.\nOverlays\nUnfortunately, photography from the sky doesn't come with labels. In other words, counties, cities and roads are rarely obvious. To help you identify these man-made labels, we provide overlays. You have the option to view major roads, all roads, counties, and cities. Just click on the overlay button and select which overlays you want to view. To turn overlays off, click on the X icon at the top of the compare tools.\nMeasure Distance\nOften times distance isn't obvious when you're looking at some particular layer. The measure tool lets you measure real distance between points, and even calculate the area of a polygon.\nClick on the measure button on the left. A flyout dialog appears on the lower left of the viewer. Click on the icon left of the option to Create a new measurement. Further instruction will prompt you to add points on the layer by clicking. When you are finished adding points, click the finish option. Another dialog will appear with your measurement. You can leave the object on the screen or remove it by clicking on the delete option on the result dialog.\nLike the other buttons on the left, clicking the measure button will toggle the measurement dialog on or off.\nOrdering Digital Imagery and Prints\nLooking at historical photos is certainly interesting, but what if you want a snapshot of an area unencumbered by watermarks? You can purchase imagery in the form of digital images (jpeg, png, or GeoTiff). Or you can purchase a printout of a selected area.\nSee that text at the top of your viewer area that reads, 'purchase image and/or print'? An arrow to the left of that text points to yet another button. If you have selected a layer other than 'map' you can click that button to make a selection within the viewable space.\nAfter you click that button with the square, you'll see the center area of the viewer remain lighter while the outside area becomes darker. This lighter area is the selected area you want to purchase. To change the size of the selected square, click and drag on one of the four corner handles indicated by a small white square.\nAfter you have positioned the viewer and selected the area you want, click on the 'Purchase Selection button now displayed at the top of the viewer. If you are a registered user, your selection will be added to your shopping cart where you can select your purchase options.\nDid you get a 'Guest Order' page? That's because you aren't logged in as a registered user. That's okay, we'll save your work and direct you to the registration page.

      "text": "By George M. Cole and John E. Ladson III Aucilla Research Institute\nSimilar to the rapid growth of plantations in the early 1800s, the late 1800s saw another large-scale development in the Aucilla River area. This was the advent of the turpentine industry. Unlike the plantations which were located along the northern reaches of the river with its rich agriculture soil, this phenomena was aimed at southern areas with its less rich soil but thriving growths of virgin long leaf pine. This development was also unlike the plantations in the upper region which were developed by settlers owning and working the land in that it involved Northern investors who had taken advantage of the inexpensive land prices in the post-war south.\nHistory \u2013 The turpentine industry in the United States had started in the Carolinas. Soon after European colonists began settling there, they learned of the resinous nature of long leaf pines. This was a significant discovery because of the need for pine pitch to caulk seams in the hull and for preserving rigging on wooden ships; Hence the term \u201cNaval Stores.\u201d Pine pitch and products made from that substance became such an important product of that region that North Carolina became known as the \u201cTarheel State\u201d and the sports teams at the University of North Carolina are nicknamed the \u201cTarheels.\u201d North Carolina seaports became the world\u2019s largest exporters of pine pitch commodities. Derivatives of the pitch, such as turpentine became widely used in paints, medicines, soaps and many other products.\nBy the mid-1800s, many of the long leaf pine forests in the Carolina Piedmont area began to decline due to agricultural practices and due to insect infestation of the trees weakened by the extraction process. As a result, the industry began to move southerly into Georgia and North Florida. At one point, in the late 19th century, the pine pitch industry had become so significant in Florida that it was the state\u2019s second largest industry, second only to citrus. In the Aucilla River area, the turpentine industry flourished with the large areas of long-leaf pines which are especially heavy producers of pine pitch. The long-leaf pine is often called the turpentine tree.\nDue to the developing Naval Stores industry in North Florida circa early 1900s, northern investors began rapidly buying large tracts of forests for pine pitch extraction. Reportedly, in 1888 a Chicago investor purchased 122,000 acres in the area for as little as twenty five cents per acre. Collecting the pitch was an extremely labor-intensive process, so large numbers of laborers were recruited for the work. They often lived in crude, so called turpentine camps, located close to the production areas. Several communities in the area featured such camps. Fanlew is an example which still appears on regional maps. Because of the shortage of labor, the leasing of convicts from the Florida Prison system became a common practice for a number of years in the early 1900s. But after complaints of cruel treatment of the assigned inmates and especially after the torture and murder of an inmate in 1922, the legislature outlawed use of convict labor.\nCollection and Processing \u2013 The original process for extracting the pine pitch was to blaze the tree and cut a \u201cbox\u201d into its base to collect the pitch which could be periodically removed by dipping. That process ultimately killed the trees. But in the early 1900s, Dr. Charles Herty developed a method for collecting the pitch that was far less labor intensive and also less damaging to the trees. His cap and gully system involved blazing the tree and installing metal gutters to direct the flow of the pine pitch into a container. He founded a company, the Herty Turpentine Cup Company, to produce terracotta collection pots for this purpose. Blazes, metal gutters and Herty cups are still occasionally seen on the few remaining turpentine trees in the area surrounding the Aucilla River and are protected by state law.\nThe pine pitch required a distillation process to produce usable products. As the industry developed, a number of small stills were built to handle the distillation process near the source of the pitch harvesting. But by the 1930\u2019s, large distillery plants began to replace the reportedly 1300 stills scattered throughout the State. Nevertheless, several of the small stills were located in the Aucilla vicinity and remains of them may be seen today. One such operation in the area was run by Thomas Puckett who later built the Mandalay Lodge along the Aucilla River.\nEnd of the Turpentine Era \u2013 By the 1950\u2019s, the turpentine era began to fade. Various factors led to its decline. Steel ships began to replace the wooden ones reducing the need for pine pitch. Further, synthetic chemicals began to be used for many of the products previously using turpentine. In addition, the great long-leaf pine forests, known for their high-quality pitch, began to disappear due to the timber boom. For a while, pine stumps left behind from the harvesting of the long-leaf timber were considered as a source of pitch. Stumps were removed using dynamite and transported to facilities that used a steam treatment process for extraction.\nTrends in the forest products industry gravitated toward pulpwood and faster growing species such as slash pine which was not conducive to pine pitch collection. Synthetic solvents became dominant, and a process was developed to produce turpentine as a by-product of paper manufacturing. Soon the venerable turpentine industry faded, and with it another era had passed."

      "text": "Uncover the Forgotten History of Florida Crackers: Resilience, Fire, and Heritage\nOn Florida Crackers, their origins in the Scottish borderlands, alliances with Seminoles, and the transformative fire ecology practices that shaped our landscape and conversation legacy.\nPicture this: You're deep in Florida's swampland, circa 1835. Gunshots echo through the cypress trees, whoops and hollers fill the air, and a group of so-called \"crackers\" are pulling off one of the greatest acts of resistance in American history - pretending to fight Native Americans while secretly protecting their allies.\nThe price of their performance?\nA mere $90 for three months of theatrical warfare that had the U.S. military completely fooled.\nThese weren't just any settlers. They were outcasts; ones the British Empire wanted to forget. Yet, these rebels had formed strong alliances with the Seminole tribe, recognizing a kindred spirit in their shared struggle for survival. Even the Romans knew about their fierce independence - there's a reason Hadrian's Wall stopped where it did.\nIn his writings, Hadrian claimed there were \"no civilized people living north of the wall.\" These were the Braveheart people (notorious for their defiance, even if the movie\u2019s historical accuracy left much to be desired), and their story of resistance was just beginning.\nA Survival Story That Will Make You Rethink Everything\nWhen you hear the term Florida Cracker, what comes to mind? Perhaps you picture a rugged cowboy cracking his whip as he herds cattle across sun-scorched prairies.\nOr maybe you think of a bygone era where untamed landscapes are met with the grit of early pioneers \u2014 much like Frederic Remington\u2019s rather imaginative renditions during this time period, pictured below.\n\u201cI was sitting in a \u201csto\u2019 do\u2019\u201d (store door) as the \u201cCrackers\u201d say, waiting for the clerk to load some \u201cnumber eights\u201d (lumber), when my friend said, \u201cLook at the cowboys!\u201d This immediately caught my interest. With me cowboys are what gems and porcelains are to some others.\u201d \u2013 Frederic Remington, 1895\nOr, if we\u2019re being honest, you might have heard the term used pejoratively\u2014a shorthand for dismissing rural Floridians as unsophisticated or backward.\nBut what if I told you that this term\u2014and the people it represents\u2014has a history far richer and more complex than most Floridians even realize? Beneath its often misunderstood connotations lies a story of survival, resilience, and a deep connection to the land.\nIf you think you know Florida's history, think again. The truth about Florida Crackers reveals a heritage that is both unexpected and essential to understanding the Sunshine State\u2019s past.\nFor a brief moment, erase the tourist brochures and theme parks that come to mind when thinking of Florida. Let me take you on a journey through this state\u2019s curious past, guided by the stories of T.R. Anderson, a descendant of some of the earliest settlers in the Sunshine State. The following is a tale of migration, survival, and fire\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014shaping the land and its people.\nThe Real Story Behind Florida's Most Misunderstood Rebels\nI recently had the privilege of sitting down with T.R. Anderson, a fire ecologist who has worked in eight different National Parks over the course of the past three decades. What he shared with me about Florida's true heritage left me questioning everything I thought I knew about my birth state.\nTo truly understand this Florida origin story, we must travel back across the Atlantic to the rugged Scottish borderlands of the 17th and 18th centuries. These were tumultuous times, with England striving to consolidate power over its neighbors. The Scots, particularly the borderlanders, were seen as unruly, fiercely independent, and inconvenient for the British Crown.\nDuring the English Clearances, thousands of Scots were displaced, often forcibly, from their ancestral lands. Many ended up in the Ulster Plantations of Northern Ireland, where they toiled as tenant farmers or indentured servants. But life there wasn\u2019t much better. Over time, these displaced people\u2014known as the Scots-Irish\u2014made their way across the Atlantic, landing in places like Savannah, Charleston, and ultimately the southeastern United States.\nA French conte (a kind of prince) who observed these early settlers described them as \"mean, very violent, also being very resourceful, but not liking to be around outsiders.\" Given their history of displacement and persecution, can you blame them?\nThe word \"cracker\" itself has fascinating origins. T.R. traced it back to Shakespeare, where it was used as a derogatory term for boisterous Scots who dared to speak up against authority. \u201cWhat crackers are these that deef our ears with superfluous speech?\u201d one of Shakespeare\u2019s characters laments. The term referred to the cracking of wood\u2014a sharp, unsettling noise symbolic of defiance. Over time, it became a badge of honor for those who refused to bend the knee.\nToday, the term Florida Cracker is often associated with the romantic image of the cowboy, thanks in part to 20th-century films and novels. But this narrative oversimplifies a much more nuanced history. The bullwhip-wielding cattle driver is just one thread in the tapestry of Cracker culture. In reality, these pioneers were diverse in their skills and lifestyles. They were loggers, hunters, and subsistence farmers. They lived off the land, not by conquering it, but by adapting to its rhythms.\nFrom Georgia's Black Belt to Florida's Prairies\nOnce in America, these Scots-Irish settlers faced yet another challenge: soil. The fertile lands of the Black Belt Prairie in Georgia and Alabama were quickly snapped up by wealthy plantation owners. This left poorer settlers with marginal land, unsuitable for large-scale agriculture.\nIn search of better opportunities, many moved southward into Florida\u2014a land of swamps, prairies, and promise. The Spanish, eager to solidify their claim to the territory, offered land grants to these settlers. The plan was strategic: populate the frontier with hardy, self-sufficient people who could defend it against British incursions.\nFlorida Crackers adapted quickly, relying on cattle, hunting, and small-scale farming to survive. Unlike the plantation owners to the north, Crackers had little interest in land ownership. Their connection to the land was practical, not possessive. Despite being forced to the periphery time and time again, they survived, forming deep alliances with indigenous peoples by sharing knowledge and strategies.\nLife & Alchemy on the Frontier\nLife in the Kissimmee River Valley was not for the faint of heart. For Crackers, every day was a test of ingenuity and resilience. They navigated a landscape of ridge and slough, where rivers were the highways and the dense interior, with its treacherous wetlands and towering sawgrass, often seemed impenetrable. In this rugged environment, survival depended on resourcefulness and a deep knowledge of the land\u2014a knowledge passed down through generations.\nT.R.\u2019s ancestors were no strangers to this hard life. His grandfather worked as a logger in the Big Cypress region of the Everglades during an era when Florida\u2019s timber resources were being rapidly exploited. Towering cypress trees, some hundreds of years old, were felled to feed the growing demand for wood, their massive trunks floated down waterways to mills. The Everglades, often mischaracterized as an endless \"river of grass,\" was, in fact, a mosaic of ecosystems that included vast stands of timber\u2014an environment T.R.'s family knew intimately.\nT.R.\u2019s mother spent her childhood in a logging camp deep in the Everglades, a place where life was as raw and untamed as the wilderness that surrounded it. She and her siblings roamed the swamps, exploring cypress domes and hunting for small game. These experiences fostered a profound connection to the land\u2014an appreciation for both its bounty and its dangers. The Everglades was their home long before it became a National Park, and their presence in the region was emblematic of the Crackers\u2019 ability to adapt to Florida\u2019s most inhospitable terrains.\nTheir connection to the land wasn\u2019t just born of necessity\u2014it was shaped by cultural ties, too. T.R.\u2019s ancestors were among the Scottish and Scots-Irish settlers who migrated to Florida during the 17th and 18th centuries. Drawn southward by Spanish land grants and the promise of opportunity, they carved out a life on the frontier. These settlers brought with them a pastoral tradition, relying on cattle grazing, hunting, and fishing to sustain their families. One element in particular, fire, remained a central tool in their way of life, used to clear fields, manage undergrowth, and maintain the delicate balance of Florida\u2019s ecosystems.\nT.R. explained that fire is elemental - as crucial to an ecosystem as water or air.\nRemove it, and the balance of the ecosystem shifts, often to the detriment of native species. These Celtic settlers understood this instinctively, bringing with them ancient fire management practices from their homeland. Drawing on their heritage, they practiced controlled burns\u2014clearing the land to encourage new growth and manage wildlife habitats. The biochar from these burns replenished nutrients in Florida's easily eroded soil, while the cleared landscape allowed wildlife like bison (yes, Florida had bison!), cattle, and deer to thrive.\nThis tradition, rooted in ancient practices from the Scottish moors, reflected a broader understanding of how humans could harmonize with nature to sustain ecosystems. Outsiders, however, often misunderstood fire as purely destructive rather than regenerative, failing to see its ecological significance.\n\ud83d\udd25 Fun Fact: Florida burns approximately 3 million acres annually - using the same principles these Celtic settlers brought with them from the Scottish moors. Without these controlled burns, Florida's unique biodiversity would collapse.\nTalk about a hot take on history!\nFire recycles nutrients back into the soil, encourages the recovery of fire-adapted plants, and maintains open habitats that countless species depend on. For example, wading birds in the Everglades need clear lines of sight to hunt for insects and fish in shallow waters\u2014a condition fire creates by reducing dense sawgrass, which can otherwise dominate the landscape. The Crackers\u2019 practice of controlled burning wasn\u2019t just a means of land management; it was a lifeline for maintaining the delicate balance of Florida\u2019s ecosystems, a balance that continues to hinge on the careful reintroduction of fire today.\nFire ecology remains critical to Florida\u2019s biodiversity, serving as a natural reset button for ecosystems that depend on periodic burns to thrive. Without fire, invasive plants can outcompete native species, and dense undergrowth can choke out critical habitats. Many of Florida\u2019s iconic ecosystems, like the longleaf pine forests and the Everglades, evolved alongside fire and rely on it for renewal.\nAs T.R. reflects on his family\u2019s story, he recalls how their lives intertwined with the indigenous Seminole people who also called the Everglades home. His ancestors formed alliances with the Seminoles, a relationship rooted in mutual respect and shared struggles against a common foe\u2014whether it was the harshness of the land or the encroachment of outside forces.\nSeminole Alliances: A Story of Resistance\nThe U.S. government\u2019s attempt to remove the Seminole people from Florida is a dark chapter in the state\u2019s history. However, it\u2019s also a story of quiet rebellion.\nDuring the Seminole Wars, when the U.S. government tried to recruit them to fight against their Native American allies, the Florida Crackers pulled off an incredible feat of resistance. According to a frustrated quartermaster's report I discovered through T.R., they would venture into the swamps, create a tremendous ruckus, fire their guns into the air... and return without a single casualty on either side.\nThey were literally getting paid to protect the very people they were supposed to be fighting. And when you look at the muster rolls for the second and third Seminole Wars, you'll find something telling - they're all from the North. No Southerners, particularly Floridians, were involved (except for a few families like the Lykes and Griffins, but that's another story altogether).\nThe Kissimmee River Valley, with its wide prairies and winding waterways, provided the backdrop for these stories of survival and resistance. It was a place where resilience was born of necessity and where families like T.R.\u2019s shaped Florida\u2019s history, not as conquerors, but as stewards of the land. Their legacy endures in the stories they left behind and in the land they helped to shape.\nThe Pitfalls of Environmental Journalism\nNo discussion of Florida\u2019s environmental history is complete without mentioning Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, the author of The Everglades: River of Grass and a pivotal figure in the conservation movement.\nMarjorie was a journalist prior to becoming an environmentalist; she worked for the Miami Herald, a newspaper her father co-founded. Despite being one of the Everglades\u2019 greatest advocates, Douglas reportedly only visited the Everglades a handful of times. She preferred writing about its beauty and importance from her home in Coconut Grove.\nDuring World War I, Douglas served in the American Red Cross, stationed in Paris. Her time there likely influenced her sense of civic duty and dedication to causes larger than herself. Published in 1947, her book on the Everglades was groundbreaking, galvanizing efforts to safeguard this unique landscape and eventually leading to the establishment of Everglades National Park.\nHowever, Douglas\u2019s portrayal of the Everglades also perpetuated what T.R. Anderson calls the pristine myth. While her writing painted a poetic picture of a pure and untouched wilderness, it ignored the deep and longstanding human relationships with the land. Indigenous peoples like the Seminoles and Miccosukees, as well as Florida Crackers, had actively managed the Everglades for generations, often using fire as a tool for ecological balance. Douglas, influenced by the conservationist ideals of her time, criticized practices like prescribed burns, viewing them as destructive intrusions rather than essential components of the ecosystem\u2019s health.\nIn her book\u2019s chapter titled \u201cThe Eleventh Hour,\u201d Douglas condemned the cattlemen\u2019s fires, suggesting they had \"ripped through the heart of the Everglades, destroying it forever.\" This perspective, while well-intentioned, oversimplified the role of fire in the Everglades\u2019 ecology. Fire, in fact, is a cornerstone of this landscape. The Everglades depend on regular burns to prevent sawgrass from overrunning open water, maintaining habitats crucial for birds, fish, and other wildlife. Without fire, this delicate balance collapses, choking the ecosystem Douglas fought so hard to protect.\nT.R. views this tension as emblematic of a broader misunderstanding in conservation. While Douglas\u2019s work was invaluable in rallying support for the Everglades, her dismissal of fire management practices contributed to policies that attempted to exclude humans from the ecosystem altogether.\nThe result was the removal of the very people\u2014Seminoles, Miccosukees, and Crackers\u2014who had shaped and sustained the Everglades for centuries.\nAs T.R. reflects, \u201cFire isn\u2019t just an element; it\u2019s a lifeblood.\u201d Today, prescribed burns are recognized as a critical tool in preserving the Everglades, aligning more closely with the practices of those who lived here long before it became a national park. While Marjorie Stoneman Douglas\u2019s influence is undeniable, her legacy is a reminder that conservation must embrace not just the land itself, but the cultural and ecological knowledge of those who have shaped it.\nA Legacy Under Threat\nAs I navigate Florida's rapidly changing landscape, I see echoes of this history everywhere. In the words of T.R.'s grandfather, when asked why his family came to Florida: \"We couldn't starve to death down here.\"\nIt's a simple statement that captures a profound truth about their relationship with the land - they didn't seek to own it, but to understand it.\nT.R. Anderson\u2019s decades-long career with the National Park Service has taken him across some of the nation\u2019s most iconic landscapes\u2014from the towering peaks of Olympic National Park to the expansive wetlands of the Everglades. His work as a fire ecologist, particularly in the Everglades, gave him a profound understanding of the delicate interplay between people, ecosystems, and policy. It also deepened his belief that history isn\u2019t just a record of the past\u2014it\u2019s a guide for shaping the future.\nT.R.\u2019s time in the Everglades exemplifies how understanding history can inform modern conservation. His office, housed in a former Cold War-era Nike missile base within the park, was a physical reminder of the many layers of human influence on this land. During his years there, T.R. pored over archives filled with stories of families\u2014Seminoles, Crackers, and others\u2014who had lived in the Everglades long before it became a National Park. These records revealed a landscape that was far from pristine, shaped by prescribed burns, timber harvesting, and indigenous practices. Yet, the National Park Service's early policies sought to erase these human connections, promoting a depopulated wilderness as the ideal.\nAs T.R. puts it, \u201cThere is no better species than Homo sapiens to carry around fire.\u201d Humans have been shaping ecosystems for over 13,000 years, and fire has been an integral part of that relationship. The Seminoles and Crackers didn\u2019t merely live off the land; they lived with it, wielding fire as a tool to maintain the balance of ecosystems. The Everglades\u2019 \u201criver of grass,\u201d pictured below, depends on fire to sustain life.\n\u201cTo remove fire from the ecosystem,\u201d he warns, \u201cis like trying to remove water or air.\u201d\nFor T.R., these historical missteps were lessons in what not to do. He began advocating for conservation policies that honored the human history of the land, including the practices of controlled burns and sustainable management. He has worked closely with indigenous communities, learning how their traditional knowledge could complement modern ecological science.\nBy integrating history into his work, T.R. developed a nuanced approach to conservation\u2014one that acknowledged the mistakes of the past while striving for a future where humans and nature coexist.\nWhy Our National Parks Are in Trouble\nDespite their iconic status, U.S. national parks face significant challenges today. Overcrowding, underfunding, climate change, and political pressures threaten the very landscapes these parks were established to protect. T.R. often reflects on these issues, emphasizing that many stem from a failure to understand the historical and cultural contexts of the parks themselves.\nThe romanticized notion that places like the Everglades were untouched wildernesses (the pristine myth) before becoming national parks is just one example T.R. provides to illustrate this. The National Park Service\u2019s decision to depopulate the Everglades erased this history, creating a landscape that was not just empty of people but also devoid of its cultural and ecological caretakers.\nEarly conservation efforts often displaced indigenous peoples and ignored traditional land management practices, creating parks that were beautiful but ecologically incomplete. Without controlled burns, invasive species have flourished in places like the Everglades, disrupting native ecosystems and diminishing biodiversity.\nCompounding these ecological challenges is the strain of overuse.\nParks like Yosemite and Yellowstone see millions of visitors annually, putting immense pressure on trails, infrastructure, and wildlife. At the same time, federal funding for the National Park Service has failed to keep pace with rising costs, leading to a maintenance backlog of over $12 billion. T.R. has witnessed firsthand how park staff are stretched thin, forced to balance the needs of visitors with the demands of conservation.\nClimate change further complicates these issues. Rising temperatures, more frequent wildfires, and shifting ecosystems threaten the very landscapes parks were created to protect. The Everglades, for example, is grappling with sea level rise and saltwater intrusion, which could transform its unique freshwater habitats into barren salt marshes.\nPreserve the Future by Understanding Florida's Past\nFor T.R., addressing these challenges requires a shift in how we view and manage our national parks.\n\u201cWe have to move beyond the idea that parks are frozen in time,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re living systems, and they need to be managed as such.\u201d\nThis means embracing practices like prescribed burns, which mimic the natural role of fire in maintaining ecosystems, and partnering with indigenous communities to incorporate traditional knowledge into modern conservation strategies.\nIt also means fostering a deeper public understanding of the history behind these landscapes. T.R. believes that educating visitors about the human stories embedded in the parks can inspire a sense of stewardship and responsibility. \u201cWhen people understand that the Everglades were shaped by fire, or that the Smoky Mountains were once home to thriving communities, they start to see themselves as part of the story\u2014and that\u2019s powerful.\u201d\nIn addition to his work as a fire ecologist, T.R. serves as a writer, editor, and producer with Into Nature Films. This film company focuses on capturing the stories of Florida\u2019s unique landscapes and communities, including a rich collection of films about fire ecology. These films, available at IntoNatureFilms.org, provide a treasure trove of Florida\u2019s history, showcasing its people, ecosystems, and conservation efforts. In exploring these films, you will not only gain deeper insights into Florida\u2019s landscapes, but also discover the human narratives that bring these places to life.\nThe future of our national parks depends on this kind of inclusive, adaptive management. By learning from history and embracing innovation, we can ensure that these landscapes remain not just beautiful, but vibrant and resilient. As T.R. puts it, \u201cOur parks are in trouble, but they\u2019re also full of promise. We just need to have the courage to see them for what they are\u2014and what they can be.\u201d\nBe Part of the Story\nAs Florida faces unprecedented environmental challenges, from rising seas to vanishing habitats, the wisdom of these forgotten rebels becomes more relevant than ever. They understood something we're desperately trying to relearn: true wealth isn't in owning the land, but in knowing how to live with it.\nHere's what you can do:\nLearn about fire management in your area: Explore resources from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission on the vital role of prescribed burns in maintaining ecosystems.\nSupport traditional land stewardship: Back initiatives like the National Park Service\u2019s co-stewardship agreements with the Miccosukee Tribe, which honor Indigenous knowledge in land management.\nShare stories of resilience: Highlight sustainable practices and historical contributions of communities like the Seminole and Miccosukee Tribes through social media or local events.\nJoin conservation efforts: Connect with programs like The Florida Land Steward initiative, which offers workshops and resources for sustainable landowners.\nWatch and share T.R.'s work: Explore the incredible Florida stories captured in these films, which highlight the intersection of history, fire ecology, and conservation.

      "text": "Bay County's most overlooked tree is also its most important: here's the longleaf story\nPANAMA CITY \u2014 There's one tree that dominates much of northwest Florida that most are likely unaware of: the longleaf pine tree.\nHistory\nThis southern pine once towered over most of the southeast, covering 90 million acres between Texas and Virginia. Old photos show impressively wide and tall old-growth tall trees dwarfing early pioneers, a far cry from the skinnier and shorter trees we see today.\nA mature longleaf stands between 80 to 100 feet tall with a trunk 3 feet in diameter. They can grow to be up to 120 feet tall.\nWood from the longleaf pine was valuable because of its durability. In places like Bay County and across the southeast, naval stores for ship building were a large economic driver for local economies. Over 200 years, timbermen were able to reduce the range of the tree to just over 3 million acres.\nCoastal towns such as Panama City and Port St Joe built up around the industry, with papermills processing all this timber into a fine pulp for other uses. Forestry at the time was a less-than-sustainable business. Before the 1930s, the \"cut and get out,\" method was common. Lumbermen would go from area to area clear-cutting forests.\nThe longleaf pine, for all its useful traits, can also take 150 years to reach its full maturity. In their place, faster growing species like slash and loblolly pines were replanted.\nTurpentining\nTurpentining, the act of extracting a sap resin from the trees, was also a big industry in Florida and Georgia particularly. Before European colonization, indigenous people would use the sap from the trees as insect repellent, antiseptic, and in the construction of canoes.\nEarly settlers set up stills where they would turn the sap into industrial products for use on boats and in other chemicals. Turpentine camps were known for harsh conditions and often used the enslaved and leased-convicts. This led to them gaining a reputation of being rowdy and dangerous places.\nThe mass scale of turpentining further led to the destruction of longleaf pine forests across the southeast and locally. Vanishing forests, the end of the convict-leasing system, and advancements in technology eventually resulted in the end of turpentining by the 1950s.\nAerial imagery from 1941 shows a largely barren and deforested landscape in Bay County. In the end, the longleaf was left with only 3% of their historical range.\nWhy should we care about a tree species?\nSome readers might be wondering why they should care about a tree. There's a few reasons:\nEcological importance\nMore than half of the 1,630 estimated plant species found in the southeast are only found within longleaf pine ecosystems. This biodiversity is second to a tropical rainforest.\nThe Florida Panhandle is one of five biodiversity hotspots in North America. The longleaf expanses and unique geography provide refuge for rare and endemic species to thrive.\nKeystone species are plants or animals that can cause whole ecosystems to collapse without their presence. The longleaf pine is considered one of them.\nOne of the threatened species harbored within longleaf forests is the gopher tortoise, which is also classified as a keystone species. Some 350 other species rely on the tortoise and their burrows. Longleaf ecosystems provide sandy oils and plant diets that greatly benefit the animal.\nThe threatened red-cockaded woodpecker is an iconic and secondary keystone species within the longleaf habitat. They are very picky with nest-building locations and often opt to live in the sometimes softer-interior of older longleaf pine trees. Other small mammals and insects go on to use the burrows they've carved out of the pines.\nLongleafs are also more resilient against natural disasters than other pines. Surveys found after Hurricanes Katrina and Michael showed that the trees were better-able to withstand high winds than other pines.\nThese trees can adjust their water uptake during droughts, are more pest-resistant than other species, and are evolved to survive wildfires.\nCultural heritage\nBefore European colonization, the longleaf pine was an essential part of life for tribes like the Choctaws and Creeks.\nEvery part of the tree down to the bark was used to build homes. Logs of larger pines were used to build canoes and their bark was used for paving village streets.\nAccording to a USDA report, the Cherokee believed the pines to have eternal lives. When there was a death in a home they would use the smoke of cooked pine branches to purify the dwelling.\nParts of the trees were used in medicines and there's a still-standing and deep-rooted indigenous craft of weaving baskets from the needles. Early settlers also took part in the craft.\nThe open and park-like understory of longleaf pine forests allowed early pioneers to graze their cattle beneath the pines. Although the deforestation largely brought this practice to an end, it is still practiced in some areas and is known as silvopasture.\nThe term \"Florida cracker,\" describing early white pioneers, is said to have come from the sound of ranch hands cracking whips trying to corral cattle roaming among the longleafs.\n\"It's just a part of our core being of if you live in the south,\" said Vernon Compton, director of the Gulf Coastal Plain Ecosystem Partnership for the Longleaf Alliance. \"The longleaf pine forest built a lot of particularly southern cities, but you would have found it throughout the growth of our country when the longleaf forests were being clear cut in the late 1800s and early 1900s so it really built a lot of our houses, commercial buildings, furniture, doors, windows, and many of our historic cities in the south.\"\nFire dependence\nA healthy longleaf pine ecosystem relies on fire to survive. The flames snuff out invasive and competing species, allowing native plants and the longleaf tree to thrive. Part of the reason the understory of a healthy longleaf ecosystem is so open and non-crowded is because of fire-management.\nIn its natural state, periodic fires would occur naturally. Early indigenous groups understood the value of fire to the ecosystem and practiced controlled, managed burns.\nEarly Florida pioneers would use fire to to clear undergrowth and fields.\nThe artform was lost at some point, but today prescribed burns are used by entities to maintain these ecosystems.\nCurrent threats\nCompton pointed to urban development being one factor, adding that the lands where the pines are is typically attractive to people. Homes aren't the only thing reducing habitat cover, conversion to agriculture and some types of forestry are also posing a threat.\nInvasive species such as cogongrass are also creating challenges. This grass is described as a \"novel fuel\" that increases fire intensities. While longleafs are fire-adapted, enough heat can still kill them.\nIncreasing frequencies and intensities of hurricanes and droughts due to climate change are also taking their toll. Although they may be more resilient than other pines, a strong hurricane can still flatten a mature longleaf ecosystem.\nAs humans push further and further into longleaf territory, it can also constrain where and when perscribed burns occur. The lack of fire can do serious damage to the forests over time.\nWhat are we doing to save the longleaf?\nMultiple groups are leading the charge to conserve lands containing longleaf pine ecosystems.\nConservation groups have been able to bring the range of the pine up to 5 million acres from its historic 3 million acre low.\nThe environmental advocates are also making resources available for property owners who want to get involved in preservation of the longleaf pine. Organizations such as America's Longleaf argue that landowners can make a profit off of creating the habitat through pine straw and timber.\nMeanwhile, replanting efforts have been underway. The Northwest Florida Water Management District celebrated planting their 20 millionth longleaf in 2022. Florida State Parks bragged that the nearby Torreya State Park restore about 350 acres of the ecosystem yearly.\nThe state recently finalized plans to create the new Sandy Creek State Forest that will preserve 12,243 acres in Bay, Calhoun, and Gulf counties. Some of the acreage contains longleaf pine habitat.\nWhere can I find a longleaf?\nIf this read has inspired you to go out and see one of these iconic pines for yourself, there could be one in your back yard. Readers can see an interactive map of the longleafs created by the Florida Forest Service.\nThe largest concentration of the trees in Bay County is in Pine Log State Forest, (Florida's oldest state forest,) and state owned lands along Econfina Creek.\nThe highest concentration in the Florida panhandle can be found on the range of Eglin Air Force Base, Blackwater State Forest, the Apalachicola National Forest, and the water management areas around Econfina Creek."

      "text": "Between 1930 to 1949, Extension played a significant role in turning around Florida\u2019s cattle industry, and changed the landscape of the state forever.\nThe Cracker Kingdom\nThere have been cattle in Florida ever since Ponce de Leon brought them to the new world in 1521. When conflicts with the Calusa Indians caused his second expedition to flee, the cows they left behind were small, wiry animals of the Andalusian \u201ccriollo\u201d breeds, uniquely adapted to Florida\u2019s climate. Decades later, Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries near St. Augustine became the first ranchers in Florida, with help from local Indian tribes. English settlers and Seminoles took up ranching after the Spanish left Florida in the 1700s, and the herds expanded throughout the state. During the Civil War, Florida became the main supplier of beef to the Confederate army, but it was during the reconstruction period, when a thriving trade opened up with Cuba, that the cattle industry really entered its golden age.\nA typical Florida rancher in those days lived on a small homestead of about 80 to 160 acres, and owned 1,000 to 2,000 head of criollo and longhorn cattle. Calves and cows he kept penned in on his property, to protect them from predators and rustlers and provide milk and fertilizer for his own use. But his steers he left to roam free, grazing on wiregrass and saw palmetto across thousands of acres of unfenced, public and privately owned land. Often, a rancher saw his cattle only once or twice a year, when it was time to drive the herd to market. To help in this long and arduous task, he relied on \u201ccow hunters\u201d\u2014 ranch hands who rode the open range on small horses, finding errant cows and pulling them from pine woods and palmetto stands. Aiding them were two trusty tools\u2014their cow dogs and their buckskin whips. The cow hunters would crack their whips to run the cattle and signal to other cow hunters. The sound of these cracking whips\u2014which could be heard for miles on a windless day\u2014became so associated with Florida cow hunters they were known as \u201ccrackers,\u201d and their steers \u201ccracker cows.\u201d\nWhen the cattle were finally rounded up, they\u2019d be driven to markets in Jacksonville, Pensacola or Tampa, where they\u2019d be boarded on steamships bound for Cuba, in exchange for gold doubloons that made ranchers, on their small homesteads miles away, wealthy enough that their names\u2014Carlton, Lykes, Summerlin, Hendry and many others\u2014are still well-known today.\nTick Fever, Arsenic and Barbed Wire\nWhen the Cooperative Extension Service started up in Florida in 1915, the state\u2019s cattle industry, second only to Texas\u2019, needed little help in thriving, but over the next few years, it was hit by a number of major setbacks. The Cuban market declined in the 1920s, and the domestic market for beef favored robust stock from the American Southwest over Florida\u2019s leaner \u201cscrub cattle.\u201d Attempts were made to improve Florida\u2019s stock by importing other breeds, but they were thwarted by the spread of bovine piroplasmosis, or Texas tick fever. As its name implies, the fever is spread by tick bites; native free-range cattle were generally immune, but they carried the disease-ridden ticks to the imported cattle, killing nearly all of them.\nThe situation became so critical that in 1923, the Florida legislature enacted a compulsory tick eradication program. With the help of the USDA, vats of arsenic were constructed to dip the cattle every 14 days until each herd was tick-free. In order to quarantine the treated cattle, ranchers had to fence them in. The days of open range and cattle hunting were over, at least for a time. At first, some of the less wealthy cattlemen resisted the eradication program, and several of the arsenic vats were dynamited. Many cattlemen sold off their entire stock ahead of the eradication program; between 1925 and 1930, the number of cattle in the state declined by 35 percent.\nExtension Helps to Turn the Industry Around\nBy 1930, the eradication program had succeeded in making north and western Florida tick-free. Cattlemen in these areas were eager to regain their business, but recognized that they needed to make some changes. To respond to cattlemen\u2019s needs, in 1930 the Extension service developed an animal husbandry program and hired its first fulltime husbandman, Walter J. Sheely. Sheely immediately began an ambitious project to help turn the Florida cattle industry around by assuring that cattle were better bred and better fed.\nIn tick-free areas, Sheely and other agents helped ranchers buy purebred Angus, Hereford and Brahman bulls to breed with cracker cows and produce bulkier calves suited to Florida\u2019s climate. The Florida Cattlemen\u2019s Association, founded in 1934 with the help of Osceola County agent June Gunn, convinced bankers to back \u201ccattle loans\u201d so that ranchers could buy new bulls.\nRanchers needed better, more nutritious pasture to support their upgraded cattle. Using research from the Agricultural Experiment Station, Extension conducted courses and field days to demonstrate methods of improving pasture grasses, the importance of feeding cattle silage over the winter, and how to properly inspect and care for their animals. One important side effect of the tick fever epidemic was that it convinced cattlemen they couldn\u2019t allow their herds to remain uncared for.\nSheely\u2019s ambition paid off\u2013within 3 years, Florida\u2019s cattle population had increased by 11 percent, the number of breeders of purebred cattle more than doubled, and the average annual calf crop rose to 30 percent.\nWith the cattle population on the rebound, improving the market value of Florida beef became the next objective. In 1935, Extension organized the first Florida Fat Stock Show at Jacksonville to help improve the market for Florida cattle; the show helped attract out-of-state buyers and ran annually until the 1940s. Sheely\u2019s office also conducted meat cutting courses, organized 4-H calf-raising programs, and produced brochures, radio shows and filmstrips to promote Florida beef.\nScrew Worm, and a New Research Center\nBut just as the Florida cattle industry was making a comeback, another scourge struck cattlemen in the form of the parasitic screw worm. Some claimed that screw worm was spread in Florida through \u201cDust Bowl\u201d cattle that were imported from the Midwest. Controlling the spread of screw worm required that ranchers carefully inspect their animals and laboriously remove the parasites by hand, and once again build fences and pens for quarantine. Screw worm would continue to plague Florida cattle until the late 1950s, when UF entomologists developed sterile screw worm pupae and dropped them by airplane over cattle ranges.\nTo further its commitment to improving the cattle industry, in 1941 the University of Florida broke ground on the Range Cattle Research Station in Ona, Florida. Later named the Range Cattle Research and Education Center, the Ona facility was established to learn how to produce better quality forage grasses and investigate the breeding, feeding and management of beef cattle in central and south Florida. Today, the Range Cattle REC is a state-of-the-art research center that offers field days, short courses and forage testing programs on more than 2,840 acres of native and developed pastures, with approximately 1,200 head of cattle.\nThe End of the Open Range\nEventually, the pressures of infectious diseases, the need for improved pasture, and Florida\u2019s growing population forced more and more cattlemen to permanently fence-in their herds. After the state legislature passed the Murphy Act in 1937, allowing the sale of tax-delinquent land, many ranchers were able to buy vast tracts of pasture land cheaply; the average land holdings of ranchers jumped from 88 acres to 870 acres. The final blow to the open range came in 1949, when Florida became the last state in the union to pass a mandatory fence law. Extension, a longtime advocate of fencing, was able to help ranchers acquire timber cheaply and demonstrate how they could treat fence posts against weather damage.\nWithin twenty years, Extension had helped completely transform Florida\u2019s cattle industry from a break-even existence to a major part of the state\u2019s economy. As a cost of progress, it had also helped change the landscape of the state and end a centuries-old way of life forever. Gone were the days of cracker cattle and cow hunters wandering open prairies of palmetto palm, wiregrass and scrub pine; in its place were large fields of green pasture, hay rolls and high-shouldered Brahmans that graze behind fences along the highway.\nSources:\nAkerman, J.

      "text": "Resource Catalog\nDocument\nLongleaf pine was exploited from first European settlement, but before 1700, dependence on navigable water for travel and trade limited impacts to coastal regions and belts along navigable streams. In these settled landscapes effects of domestication included land clearing and establishment of saturation densities of open range cattle and hogs which fed on longleaf pine seedlings in nearby woods. Effects of commercial logging were negligible until introduction of the water-powered sawmill in 1714, but by the 1760s hundreds of these were turning out milled lumber. Still, deforestation was limited to narrow patterns defined by streams and rivers. By this time much of the eastern Piedmont was fully settled and the frontier had passed on almost to the Appalachians. By the Civil War all the best land on the Atlantic slope was in fields and pasture, but much virgin forest remained on the Gulf coast. The naval stores industry began in Virginia, where boxing longleaf for crude turpentine was practiced all through the Colonial Period, and most of the longleaf there was decimated by 1840, but there had been little impact to the south, with the exception of stands along rivers in North Carolina. Then, in 1834, adaptation of the copper whiskey still to turpentine distillation made the process vastly more efficient and profitable. This activity, which left most of the primeval pine forest weakened or destroyed, swept south and then west along the Gulf, decade by decade, as northern stands were exhausted, reaching full swing in the last stands in Texas around 1900. Steam technology mushroomed by 1870, with proliferation of logging railroads, steam log skidders and steam sawmills, and virtually all remaining virgin timber in the South came down during the era of intensive logging from 1870 to 1920. The 1920s saw the beginning of converson of unmanaged woodlands to pine plantation, now about 15% of southern uplands. The presettlement range of longleaf pine is estimated at 92 million acres, of which 74 million were longleaf dominant and 18 million had longleaf in mixtures with other pines and hardwoods. By 1946, longleaf pine had dwindled to 1/6 its original acreage. This decline has continued until only about 3% remains.\nCataloging Information\n- adaptation\n- agriculture\n- copper\n- deforestation\n- European settlement\n- fire exclusion\n- forest management\n- grazing\n- hardwoods\n- histories\n- logging\n- longleaf pine\n- North Carolina\n- Piedmont\n- pine\n- pine forests\n- Pinus palustris\n- presettlement vegetation\n- regeneration\n- rivers\n- seedlings\n- streams\n- Texas\n- turpentine\n- Virginia\n- water\n- wood\nThis bibliographic record was either created or modified by Tall Timbers and is provided without charge to promote research and education in Fire Ecology.

      "text": "Restoring the Land of the Longleaf Pine\nFire helps the plants and animals of longleaf forests thrive.\nLongleaf pine was once the dominant Southeastern coastal plain tree, covering 90 million acres from southern Virginia to eastern Texas. North Carolina\u2019s state toast describes the state as \u201cthe land of the longleaf pine,\u201d but in the centuries after Europeans arrived, this tree was exploited to the point where just 3.5 million acres remained by the mid-20th century.\nLongleaf pine is prized for its strong, straight wood and resistance to decay. These trees were used to create building materials and, during the Colonial period, ship masts. Its resin was an important source of tar, rosin, pitch and turpentine\u2014collectively known as naval stores because of their use in shipbuilding. North Carolina was given the nickname of \u201cthe Tarheel State\u201d around the time of the Civil War for its connection to this industry.\nLongleaf pine forests are adapted to fire. In fact, fire helps young longleaf pines and native plants flourish by removing invasive shrubs and other competing vegetation. Indigenous people were forward-thinking environmental stewards, and for this reason, fire was an essential tool for maintaining healthy ecosystems on the coastal plain. However, in the 20th century, with the turpentine and logging industry booming, most fire was excluded from the forest to its detriment.\nToday, The Nature Conservancy is working to restore, connect and manage longleaf pine, and longleaf ecosystems have rebounded to 5.2 million acres across the Southeast.\nHow Fire Works to Support Longleaf\nControlled burns, also known as prescribed fire, is the process of mimicking natural fire in the landscape. By managing the natural process of fire on the landscape, instead of preventing it, we can improve habitats for native plants and animals and reduce the risk of out-of-control wildfires.\nControlled burns require a lot of planning and only happen under the safest conditions by trained practitioners. Burn crews look at things like wind direction, humidity and the location of fire lines to determine when and where to burn.\nLongleaf pine trees are specially adapted to fire coming through the landscape. The longleaf pine apical bud, located at the tip of the terminal stem, is crucial for the tree's growth and survival. As long as the bud remains intact, the tree will survive.\nLongleaf Pine Growth Stages\nIn the \"grass stage,\u201d which can last up to seven years, seedlings grow strong root systems while keeping the bud at ground level, away from the hottest part of a fire. In this stage, fire is crucial to keep the forest floor clear from brush and other species that can grow quickly and outcompete the young longleaf.\nIn the bottlebrush and sapling stages, dense needles protect the bud from fire\u2019s heat. A strong root system allows saplings to quickly grow above a typical fire\u2019s flame height. Mature longleaf pine trees have thick, protective bark and, while they may lose most needles after a fire, the needles immediately regrow, and the trees are soon bushy and green again.\nGet Updates from the Field\nSign up for our monthly e-newsletter.\nFirst Longleaf Pine Stewards\nThe history of the Lumbee and Waccamaw Siouan tribes are deeply woven into the pine needles and deep root systems that characterize longleaf pine trees. In 1526, Spanish explorer Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo wrote about Waccamaw Siouan ancestors\u2019 houses made out of longleaf pine:\nQuote: Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo\nWindy is a historian and conservationist of Waccamaw Siouan descent from Castle Hayne, NC. Windy's work is rooted in the belief that history and environmentalism are inextricably linked. With deep family ties to the Waccamaw Siouan Buckhead community, she approaches conservation through the vital lens of Indigenous land practices. This perspective guides her role as the Education and Marketing Coordinator for the Hooheh Cultural Burn project and in her other work. Now serving on the NPCA\u2019s Next Generation Advisory Council and pursuing a degree in Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation at Oregon State University, Windy continues to advocate for a future where history illuminates our path and conservation guides our steps forward.\nWindy Daniels, Waccamaw Siouan STEM Program Education and Marketing Manager, explains that these structures were large meeting houses where clans gathered. At the center of the house was the sacred fire, with an opening in the ceiling to allow smoke to escape. The name of these principal houses is ouke, pronounced \u201cOh-u-k,\u201d the Woccon word for house. Woccon was a subdivision of the Waccamaw and likely spoke the same or a similar Siouan language as the Waccamaw Siouan today.\nThe turpentine and logging industries of the 1800s devastated longleaf pine forests, deeply affecting the tribes that called them home. Communities lost ancestral lands, ceremonial traditions and the ability to pass down cultural knowledge across generations. One of those ancestral areas was the Green Swamp region in southeastern North Carolina\u2014a vast wetland system full of longleaf pine and cypress trees that served as refuge and home for the Waccamaw after the Tuscarora Wars.\nIn the early 1900s, the Waccamaw Lumber Company began large-scale logging in the Green Swamp. They acquired over 230,000 acres across Columbus and Brunswick counties and constructed an 18-mile railroad into the swamp, which they drained to harvest the timber. \u201cThe environmental and cultural disruption was profound. But the most damaging effect we\u2019re still dealing with from those industrial activities is the health and environmental concerns. We\u2019ve faced challenges with soil and water contamination, which has led to increased health risks\u2014especially elevated cancer rates,\u201d Windy reflects.\nA walk through TNC\u2019s Green Swamp Preserve offers a glimpse into what the region looked like before European arrival. It remains one of the best existing examples of healthy longleaf pine savannas interspersed with pocosin wetlands.\nAbout Windy Daniels\nWindy is a historian and conservationist of Waccamaw Siouan descent from Castle Hayne, NC.

The Hooheh Restoration Cultural Burn Program, funded by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and TNC, is reintroducing traditional fire management practices to tribal communities, restoring longleaf pine ecosystems, developing educational programs for kids and fostering opportunities for the Waccamaw Siouan Tribe to engage in decision-making, economic development and co-management of ancestral land.\nOn February 2025, as part of the longleaf restoration, the Waccamaw Siouan Tribe hosted a tree planting ceremony on their tribal grounds in southern Bladen County. \u201cIt was the first time our people have come together for something like that, ever,\u201d Windy shares.\nQuote: Windy Daniels\nTNC\u2019s Plant a Billion campaign helped prepare the site and plant 18 acres of longleaf. The ceremony highlighted the work of the Hooheh initiative, including a ceremonial planting of trees in a circular pattern, which will eventually bend and form an ouke\u201d\u2014a traditional home. Each tree represented one of the main families of the Tribe and was planted by an Elder from that family.\n\u201cWe know they won't be there to see that, but by having them plant those trees, it is a continuation of their spirit and love growing with us forever,\u201d Windy says. \u201cThis was a powerful and emotional connection that further tied us to the land and our people.\u201d\nPlants and Animals that Inhabit Longleaf Pine Forests\nLongleaf pines are considered a foundational species: they provide essential structure and habitat for a wide range of plants and animals. You can see and hear all these species at our Calloway or Green Swamp preserves.\nEssentials for Longleaf Pine Forest Owners\nNorth Carolina offers a robust network of support for landowners managing longleaf pine forests. These resources include technical guidance, financial assistance and conservation partnerships:\nPrescribed Burn Associations: A community-based organization connecting private landowners and interested citizens to a prescribed fire network. Offers cost-share programs and technical assistance.\nSafe Harbor Program: Started in 2006 with goal of recovering the population of Red-cockaded woodpeckers, while providing assistance to private owners. Offers management guidance, pest control and flexibility to continue timber production, and reduces legal uncertainty from having an RCW on your land.\nStatewide Safe Harbor\nSandhills Safe Harbor\nLand protection: TNC acquires land in strategic locations to meet longleaf conservation goals. Purchased lands are often transferred to state or federal agencies to allow for public use and enjoyment, while other properties are added to our network of nature preserves. TNC will also acquire conservation easements, where the landowner retains ownership of the property and sells or donates the development rights and other land use rights that would degrade the conservation values. TNC works in partnership with the landowner to protect the habitat on the property. To date, TNC has contributed to the protection of over 740,000 acres in North Carolina.\nThe Longleaf Alliance: Provides educational materials and restoration strategies, and connects landowners with local implementation teams."

      "text": "Longleaf Pine: A Tree for Our Time\nThroughout the Southeast, a coordinated effort is underway to conserve and restore these rich and vital forests.\nSpanning nine states in the U.S. southeast, we\u2019re working together to restore and manage longleaf pine forest from Texas to Virginia. Longleaf pine once dominated the coastal plain blanketing more than 90 million acres. Today there are just 5.2 million acres, up from an historical low of 3.2 million acres two decades ago.\nLongleaf pine played an important role in America\u2019s history. In Colonial times, pine pitch was a major component in ship construction. \u201cNaval stores\u201d\u2014tar and turpentine derived from longleaf pine sap\u2014were used to waterproof ships. North Carolina got its nickname the \u201cTarheel State\u201d because of that work. No doubt, many of the people who cheer, and boo, the Carolina Tarheels teams have no idea where that nickname originated. Longleaf pine was also crucial to victory in World War II. Troops landing on the beach at Normandy arrived in Higgins Landing Crafts constructed out of longleaf pine from Louisiana.\nThreats to Longleaf Pine\nFactors causing longleaf loss:\n-\nLongleaf is fire dependent\u2014it needs regular fires to thrive. The region\u2019s earliest land managers, Indigenous People, understood this and set fires to improve forest health. Early colonists followed suit. But during the last century, the use of fire as a management tool was strongly discouraged throughout North America.\n-\nLongleaf pine is found in some of the country\u2019s fastest growing regions. These locations are prime for modern development. Witness the number of subdivisions that have some iteration of longleaf or pine in their names.\n-\nMuch of the historical loss of longleaf was due to logging. Today TNC and other conservation partners encourage sustainable forestry practices for economic and environmental health. Longleaf wood is still valued in construction due to its strength and durability. Selective thinning operations can improve longleaf forest stands and benefit private landowners financially. Some salvage operators bring longleaf that was lost centuries ago on its way to mills from river bottoms and the wood is still intact and valued for construction.\nLongleaf Pine: A Tree for Our Time\nNow more than ever, it is important that we double down on longleaf restoration. A changing climate means more hurricanes and other strong storms. The dual threats of climate change and biodiversity loss are impacting both people and nature on a large scale. With a changing climate comes periods of drought and accompanying wildfires. Nature can play a role in making the region more resilient to these impacts. Longleaf pine thrives in harsh variable climates and provides habitat for many threatened and endangered species\u2014making it the perfect tree for our time.\nQuote: Colette DeGarady\nColette DeGarady is all about longleaf pine, leading TNC\u2019s efforts to restore longleaf forests. Although the numbers are still small compared to their historical level, DeGarady sees promise because TNC\u2019s efforts are paying off. Now she and her team are working to keep that momentum going.\nWhy Longleaf Pine?\nHere are the many benefits of longleaf pine that help it thrive naturally better than other trees.\nNature's latest, right to your inbox.\nGet the latest updates from conservation work near you and around the world.\nWorking to Grow and Manage Longleaf\nTNC's approach to protection\n-\nTNC protects property across the longleaf range. Some of these sites contain spectacular examples of intact longleaf habitat while others require different degrees of restoration.\n-\nMany longleaf pine forests were logged and replaced with commercial forest trees such as loblolly and slash pine. TNC restores these sites with longleaf pine and has planted millions of longleaf seedlings across the Southeast.\n-\nLongleaf needs fire to thrive and survive. TNC conducts controlled burns on its own lands and assists partners to put more fire on their land.\nTNC manages preserves across the longleaf range that serve as living laboratories for restoration. One of the most visited of these preserves is TNC's Disney Wilderness Preserve near Orlando, Florida. Visitors to that preserve and others scattered across the region can see longleaf pine forests, learn about its management and see some of the cool creatures who make their homes in longleaf pine.\nVisitors may be inclined to look up at the majestic, iconic trees, but much of the longleaf forest\u2019s diverse beauty is on the ground.\nQuote: David Printiss\nWorking with Partners\nTNC also works with a variety of conservation partners including the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, state game, forestry and park agencies, and the Department of Defense.\nOur work with the Department of Defense was pioneered at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. The military wants to ensure that development doesn\u2019t encroach on base boundaries hindering the mission of the world\u2019s largest military training facility. So far, the Department of Defense and TNC have protected 24,000 acres, buffering 48 miles of military training land boundary in the NC Sandhills that is vital longleaf habitat. This work has been replicated elsewhere including Fort Benning, Georgia and Camp Shelby, Mississippi.\nQuote: Jesse Wimberly\nWe are also working with private landowners. This is very important because approximately 86% of the forestland in the Southeast is owned by private landowners.\nJesse Wimberly is one of those private landowners. Wimberly has managed his family\u2019s Lighterwood Farm in the North Carolina Sandhills for three decades. Recently, with TNC\u2019s assistance, he has created a Prescribed Burn Association to help private landowners manage their longleaf. Wimberly\u2019s farm is an ode to longleaf, named after lighterwood \u2014the heartwood of longleaf pine, which is filled with turpentine that makes for great kindling.\nLongleaf Pine Is Home to Rare Plants and Animals\nWimberly and other longleaf lovers hope to coax back rare plants and animals to their land. Red-cockaded woodpeckers are the best known of the animals that thrive primarily in longleaf forests. These tiny birds were once common throughout the longleaf range, but their population declined in tandem with longleaf forest destruction. In the past few years, however, their numbers have grown due to the emphasis on restoring longleaf across the range.\nEastern indigo snakes are another rare longleaf species, once found throughout Florida, Georgia, Southern Alabama, and southeastern Mississippi. They can grow up to nine feet in length, making them the longest snake native to the United States. These non-venomous snakes prey upon venomous snakes and are particularly beautiful with blue black scales reminiscent of Wonder Woman\u2019s hair. TNC is working on a 10-year plan to reintroduce this apex predator to Florida\u2019s Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve.\nGopher tortoises are also confined to the southern longleaf range. They are one of only five tortoises native to North America and the only native tortoise east of the Mississippi. Gopher tortoises originated in North America 60 million years ago, making them one of the oldest living species. They spend a lot of time underground in their burrows, which can be more than 30 feet long. These creatures may not look important, but they are a keystone species; more than 350 other species including the Eastern indigo snake depend on their burrows for shelter.\nProbably the most well-known denizen of longleaf forest is the carnivorous Venus flytrap, which naturally occurs in a small area roughly 75 miles around Wilmington, North Carolina. This plant, which Charles Darwin once called the \u201cmost wonderful in the world\u201d and which served as the inspiration for Audrey in \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors,\u201d is one of many plants that occur only in longleaf pine habitat. TNC\u2019s Green Swamp Preserve is home to flytraps and 13 other carnivorous plant species and more than 30 different orchid species\u2014witness to the diversity of longleaf understory.\nAnimals of the Longleaf Pine Forest\nHow You Can Help Save Longleaf Pine\nLongleaf pine forests are fascinating places\u2014home to an amazing array of plants and animals. They can also play a vital role in the southeast, providing a natural defense to climate change. That\u2019s why TNC is focused on restoring longleaf forest across the region. You can help us with this work. Support longleaf pine planting through TNC\u2019s Plant a Billion Trees Program.\nPlaces Where You Can Visit a Longleaf Pine Forest\nAnother way you can help is to visit one of TNC's preserves that is home to restored longleaf pine habitat.\n-\nAlabama\nSplinter Hill Bog Preserve: The Ruth McClellan Abronski Splinter Hill Bog Preserve was renamed in 2014 to honor a supporter who donated her estate to conservation.

      "text": "According to Conservation International, there are 36 biodiversity hotspots worldwide. These are defined as areas with \u201cat least 1,500 vascular plants as endemics \u2014 which is to say, it must have a high percentage of plant life found nowhere else on the planet. A hotspot, in other words, is irreplaceable. It must have 30% or less of its original natural vegetation. In other words, it must be threatened.\u201d\nOnly two of these 36 biodiversity hotspots lie within the United States, including the North American Coastal Plain, which stretches from Texas along the Gulf Coast and up the Atlantic coast. The state of Florida rests fully within the coastal plain. Within that region, northwest Florida is the hottest \u201cbiodiversity hotspot,\u201d one of just six designated regions in North America.\nWhy us? How did our little corner of the state earn such notoriety? If you\u2019ve ever spent August here, you know how very hot and humid it gets in the summer. As we experienced with the snow and freeze a couple of weeks ago, the Panhandle endures some rather extreme temperatures that fall within our natural range. Our coastal communities sit just above sea level, but we\u2019ve also got hills\u2014while not terribly high (345 feet), the state\u2019s highest point is in Walton County. Along the bluffs of the Apalachicola are whispers of the last Ice Age, where fingers of the Appalachian Mountain range are visible in the same hardwood species and geologic formations typical of north Georgia and Tennessee.\nAs they say, variety is the spice of life, and this wide spectrum of livable habitats, from coastal marsh to high and dry ridges means we have more options for plants and wildlife to inhabit. The Florida panhandle is home to more than 2500 plant species, 300 species of birds, and 25 species of salamanders, including many endemic species found nowhere else in the world. The oxygen-deprived soils of our flatwood bogs give rise to dozens of carnivorous plant species. They\u2019ve adapted to poor nutrition in the soil by supplementing with insects. Vast waterways mean we have 500 species of saltwater fish and at least 85-90 freshwater fish, including those that live a portion of their life cycle in both.\nA project known as the Northwest Florida Greenway Corridor is actively being funded and set aside to create a 150,000 acre conservation region connecting two million acres of protected land including Blackwater River State Forest, Eglin Air Force Base, and Apalachicola National Forest . Along with coastal barrier islands and inland areas of Gulf Islands National Seashore, these huge swaths of land enable large species like bears, alligators, and cats to roam with less interference from human development. Restoration of longleaf pine and dune ecosystems mean the land and waters are managed to ensure the survival of smaller endangered species like flatwoods salamanders, beach mice, gopher tortoises, red cockaded woodpeckers, and sea turtles. The confluence of less development (compared with densely urban areas to our south), large state and national parks, and protected military bases have allowed plants and wildlife to thrive unlike any other region.\nIn science, we measure both species richness (the number of different species in an area) and abundance (actual number of individuals) to come up with an index for species diversity. Generally, the higher these numbers, the healthier the ecosystem. A clear example of this can be seen when monitoring water quality in streams. If you sample the macroinvertebrate population of a creek and find only bloodworms, you know water quality conditions are terrible. These species can survive in sewage water. But, if you find dozens of species, particularly the larvae of pollution-sensitive caddisflies, mayflies, and stoneflies, this indicates the water is clean and hospitable to a wide variety of species. These insects serve as the basis of the food web for fish, crabs, and larger animals that maintain a healthy ecosystem.\nIt\u2019s generally understood in ecology that the \u201chigher the diversity, the greater the stability.\u201d When we create monocultures\u2014ecosystems containing one or only a handful of dominant species types\u2014these systems are weak and susceptible to attack. Agricultural operations that grow one crop are prime examples of how monocultures can be highly vulnerable\u2014orange groves devastated by disease or freezes; chicken farms wiped out by avian influenza. They cannot adapt to threats, and being genetically similar they can be easily devastated by a single disease or environmental threat. Having a diversity of species creates a redundant \u201cback-up\u201d system for crucial ecosystem services, like providing pollen, erosion management, or shade from extreme heat if other species suffer from pathogens or parasites.\nJust like economists measure the health of an economy by productivity, ecologists can analyze ecosystems mathematically. And where are those most productive ecosystems located? It\u2019s not the extreme habitats of tundra, grassland, and desert, where only a handful of species survive. The most productive ecosystems\u2014those cycling nutrients, producing oxygen, and converting solar energy to biomass, are the most diverse ones. At the top are tropical rainforests, coral reefs, and estuarine swamps and marshes. These ecosystems have thousands of moving parts and are virtually impenetrable to a single disease or pest wiping them out. If one species suffers, there are so many backups to fill in and perform the important roles. In fact, the only disturbance any of these systems can\u2019t defend against are complete clearing or extreme pollution by humans.\nThe world is much bigger than humanity. It is wise to consider the words of my favorite biologist, E.O. Wilson. An expert on insects, especially ants, he once said, \u201cIf all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos.\u201d\n- Hurricane Season 2025 - July 7, 2025\n- The Striped Burrfish - April 11, 2025\n- The Value of Biodiversity - March 28, 2025"

      "text": "Planting trees through our 50 Million for Our Forests campaign has many documented benefits, such as improving forest health, air quality, and watershed stability. Tree planting projects also restore wildlife habitat, including restoring habitat for endangered or threatened species.\nLongleaf pine forests once covered 90 million acres spanning from present day Virginia, down to Florida, and stretching into Texas. After decades of fire suppression and intense logging, only about 6% of the highly fragmented forest remains. Since 2010, over three million longleaf pine trees have been planted by the National Forest Foundation to help restore the forest to its former range.\nLongleaf pine trees are very tall, usually reaching heights of 98 to 115 feet. The name comes from their needles, which are the longest of the eastern pine species. These needles grow in bunches of three and are 8 to 15 inches long on mature trees.\nLongleaf pine forests are home to hundreds of unique plant and animal species. Approximately 900 plant species are only found in longleaf pine forest ecosystems, and there are over 20 other threatened or endangered species, including the gopher tortoise. The gopher tortoise is federally considered threatened in it\u2019s western range, and all states throughout the species range offer protections. The gopher tortoise is considered a keystone species, as burrows dug by the tortoise are relied upon by over 350 other species, such as mice, snakes, frogs, and small mammals.\nGopher tortoises are 9 to 11 inches long when fully grown, and usually live 40 to 60 years and spend around 80% of their lifetime in their burrows. Burrows are typically 15 feet long, and 6.5 feet deep, and gopher tortoises often use multiple burrows over the course of their lives. Burrows maintain a steady temperature and humidity throughout the year, offering protection from the elements and threats like hurricanes and fire. Longleaf pine forests are ideal habitats for gopher tortoises, with their sandy soils, open and grassy forest floors, and lots of sunlight. Longleaf pine forest ecosystems also support the plants that compose the gopher tortoises\u2019 diet.\nWorking with the US Forest Service, The Longleaf Alliance, and donors such as Endangered Species Chocolate, the National Forest Foundation plants longleaf pine trees, helping to restore the longleaf pine range, improve ecosystem and habitat connectivity, and help reestablish habitat for many species, including the gopher tortoise.\nThis blog post is sponsored by Endangered Species Chocolate, a National Forest Foundation partner since 2019."

      "text": "IN the old days lumbermen had a harsh motto\u2014\u201dCut and get out\u201d\u2014as they marched across U.S. forests leaving them stumped and stripped. The result was that by the late 1930s the U.S. was in danger of becoming timber-poor, and the lumber industry was under heavy fire from conservationists. Today, lumbermen have a new approach and a new program that promises to produce more trees than ever before. The project: tree farming, under which U.S. forests are as carefully planted, managed and harvested as lettuce and tomatoes. When loggers fell a tree, they make sure a new one grows in its place.\nTree farms, ranging in size from small, back-country wood lots to the vast forests of big logging firms, now cover 33,692,964 acres, an area bigger than New York State. Some 3,500,000 of these acres were set aside for farms last year for the first time. In the South tree farms cover 21 million acres from North Carolina to Texas. Florida has one gigantic farm of 800,000 acres owned by St. Joe Paper Co., and Texas has 3,400,000 acres producing fast-growing Southern pines for U.S. construction and pulp mills. But the biggest operations are in the Pacific Northwest, where the idea first took root. There the Weyerhaeuser Timber Co., Potlatch Forests, J. Neils Lumber, Crown Zellerbach, Long-Bell Rayonier, and other large companies have nearly 8,000,000 acres of tall Douglas fir, cedar, hemlock, spruce and pine spreading across four states.\nCredit for the idea goes largely to the Weyerhaeusers. As far back as the turn of the century enlightened lumbermen talked of timber as a steady crop instead of something to be mined like gold. But no one did much in an organized way until 1941, when dwindling U.S. lumber reserves, new wood-using industries, and the increased needs of World War II gave the idea a boost. For a starter, Weyerhaeuser planted the first 120,000 acres of logged-over ground near Montesano, Wash, with Douglas fir seedlings, and sat back to watch them grow to logging size in 80 to 100 years.\nTo help nature work for man, loggers now act as regulators of the natural reseeding process. For example, in cutting over an area of Douglas fir, they fell trees in blocks about half a mile square, leaving thick stands of mature trees as natural nurseries to sow their airborne seeds over the cut areas. At five years the seedlings are Christmas-tree size and at 20 about the height of a two-story house, and growing about 300 to the acre. When the crop is 30 years old, the lumberman\u2019s harvest begins. With power saws the lumbermen thin out the weakest trees, use the wood for pulp and poles, leave the best trees to mature in another 50 to 70 years into huge, 150-ft. giants for the building industry.\nThe harvest is only half the job. Year round company foresters roam the woods to protect the crops against disease and fire, spray insecticides to kill off such enemies as the pine beetle and the spruce budworm, which can destroy masses of trees. If fire has cleaned out all mature, seed-bearing trees, the timbermen do their own planting. In six years Crown Zellerbach seeded nearly 30,000 acres of barren land, gave away more than 1,000,000 seedlings to 4-H clubs and others for planting.\nSpurred by many new uses for wood, U.S. lumber production last year hit a near record of 36 billion board feet. Yet the loggers promise that there will be more timber in the U.S. in the future than there is now. \u201cOur big problem,\u201d says Arthur W. Priaulx of the West Coast Lumbermen\u2019s Association, \u201cis to get the idea across to the little guys. They can realize $25 an acre every year by tree farming, more than they can make by putting the same land into pasture.\u201d Those who have tried it agree. Says one timber-wise farmer, who tree-farms 180 acres in Washington\u2019s Lewis County: \u201cFor years we struggled to clear this land for pasture and crops . . . Finally, the timber company told us to get wise and harvest timber as a crop. In the last ten years I\u2019ve harvested 1,000,000 board feet of railway crossties, 800 cords of fuel wood, 1,000,000 board feet of saw logs and 500 cords of pulpwood off that land. Now my motto is \u2018Let your tree work for you.\u2019 It pays.\u201d\nMore Must-Reads from TIME\n- Cybersecurity Experts Are Sounding the Alarm on DOGE\n- Meet the 2025 Women of the Year\n- The Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion\n- Why Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\n- Colman Domingo Leads With Radical Love\n- How to Get Better at Doing Things Alone\n- Michelle Zauner Stares Down the Darkness\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Keystone species are critical because entire ecosystems rely on their presence to remain balanced. If removed, the ecological structure may collapse. They differ from indicator species, which reflect the health and maturity of an ecosystem rather than supporting it directly.\nOne such keystone species in Florida is the Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris). This towering pine is a symbol of the Southeast\u2019s once vast pine grassland ecosystems.\nHistorically, Longleaf Pine forests covered over 90 million acres across the southeastern United States. Today. As of 2024, just over 5 million acres remain. This is just approximately 5 % of the original forest coverage. As researchers and land managers recognize their ecological importance, restoration efforts are gaining momentum, bringing attention to this resilient species.\nAmazing Fire Adaptations\nLongleaf Pines are uniquely adapted to fire, a natural and necessary process in their native habitats. Their life cycle includes distinct stages designed to protect the tree\u2019s growth point from heat damage:\nGrass Stage (Years 1\u20137):\nAppears as a tuft of long needles\nFocuses on building a deep root system\nNeedles insulate the apical meristem (growing tip) from fire\nBroom Stage:\nRapid vertical growth pushes growing tissue above typical fire height\nAllows the tree to mature without fire-related setbacks\nAdult Stage:\nGrows to heights of 60\u2013125 feet\nReaches full maturity at 100\u2013150 years\nBark becomes thick and flaky, shedding easily during fire events\nThese adaptations not only help the tree survive, but also allow fire to clear underbrush\u2014benefiting grasses, wildflowers, and wildlife that depend on open landscapes.\nPlant Identification\nMature trees are irregular in uniformity with an overall oval habit.\nNeedles are 8-14 inches long with 3 needles per fascicle. Occasional groups of only 2 needed will be found.\nFemale cones are 6-12 inches long.\nBark color includes brows, grey and orange in scaly plates.\nRed-Cockaded Woodpeckers Depend on Longleaf Pine trees\nAn iconic indicator species in mature Longleaf Pine forests is the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Endangered and highly selective in nesting habitat, this woodpecker prefers living trees\u2014especially those over 80 years old. Older Longleaf Pines often host heart rot fungus, which softens the interior wood and allows the birds to carve out nesting cavities.\nThese primary cavities then support other species, such as small mammals and insects, making the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker a secondary keystone species within this habitat.\nWhy Keystone Species Matter\nProtecting keystone species like the Longleaf Pine isn\u2019t just about preserving individual trees\u2014it\u2019s about conserving entire ecosystems. Once lost, keystone species are difficult\u2014and sometimes impossible\u2014to reintroduce. Their absence can trigger cascading effects throughout the food chain and alter the landscape\u2019s structure and function.\nRestoring Longleaf Pine forests is essential for safeguarding Florida\u2019s biodiversity, improving land resilience, and maintaining a healthy ecological legacy for future generations.\nFor planting or management advice, contact your local UF/IFAS Extension Office, and explore resources on ecosystem restoration through FFL Landscaping.\nAdditional Recourses: https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/ST469\nhttps://gardeningsolutions.ifas.ufl.edu/plants/trees-and-shrubs/trees/longleaf-pine/"

      "text": "Longleaf pine forests were once one of the most extensive ecosystems in North America. The historic range of longleaf pine stretched from Texas to Virginia, covering approximately 90 million acres. Early explorers described the forest as a vast open park-like savanna of long-needled pine over a diverse understory of grasses and forbs. Frequent fires caused by lightning strikes shaped the longleaf forest for thousands of years, resulting in a unique forest home to many endemic (restricted to a certain area) plants and animals that require fire or habitats created by fire to survive. Longleaf pine is well-suited for the landowner who may want to manage for multiple uses including forest products (timber, pine-straw), recreation, wildlife, and aesthetics. Whether you are a tree farmer, an environmentalist, a hunter, a hiker, or a combination of these, you can enjoy the many superior qualities of a longleaf forest.\nLearn more: Introduction to Long Leaf Pine\nMuch of North Carolina\u2019s past was shaped by the longleaf pine. Cattlemen, turpentine producers, loggers and health resorts were born within and thrived under the longleaf pine. Its historic importance is recognized through the State Toast, and the official State Tree of NC is the pine. For many landowners, returning their land to presettlement condition is reason enough to become a part of the longleaf pine restoration effort.\nLearn more about the history of longleaf pine in North Carolina.\nThe longleaf forest provides excellent habitat for many wildlife species. The early successional understory layer of legumes and herbs maintained by periodic fire produces lots of hard seed that supports a diverse wildlife population. Quail, turkey, deer and numerous songbirds such as the bachman\u2019s sparrow, pine warbler, and bluebirds, prefer the open, early successional habitat. Many wildlife species prefer the longleaf pine ecosystem and several are found nowhere else. Among them is the southeastern fox squirrel, the largest squirrel in the Southeast, the gopher tortoise in the Gulf Coast region, the northern pine snake, and the red-cockaded woodpecker, the only woodpecker in the world to excavate its cavity in living trees. The wet savannas and flatwoods contain up to 40 different plant species per square meter including many rare plants, such as the roughleaf loosestrife and the unique insectivorous plants such as Venus\u2019s fly-trap and pitcher plants. Of the estimated 1630 plants found in the Southeast, more than half of them are found only in the longleaf ecosystem. This astonishing biodiversity is second only to a tropical rainforest.\nLearn more about managing longleaf for wildlife and threatened and endangered species.\nLongleaf pine naturally grows straighter, tapers less, and produces a stronger, heavier wood than loblolly pine. Longleaf yields a higher number of poles and pilings whose value is 30-to-40 percent higher than sawtimber. Longleaf pine is commonly grown at harvest rotations of 60-to-80 years, but can grow past 150 years. This long life span allows landowners more time to plan thinning and wait for high timber prices. Longleaf pines respond well to release with increased growth at older ages and higher stand densities. Longleaf pine grows well on less fertile soils and can out compete loblolly pine on poor and average sites. Longleaf pine straw is a high-value landscaping mulch due to its longer length, attractive color, and decay resistance. Landowners can rake 75-to-100 bales per acre every two or three years and earn an extra $100-to-$200/acre depending on site quality and tree density.\nLearn more about site selection and regeneration, burning longleaf, and raking pine-straw.\nA longleaf forest is aesthetically pleasing. The open and grassy landscape is easy to walk through while enjoying the solitude and beauty of the diverse ecosystem. Many landowners prefer to retain most of the forest and maintain wildlife habitat and visual beauty, yet still sustain a flow of income from periodic timber harvests. They are stewards of the land and manage all the natural resources.The group selection or shelterwood harvest method is a good choice for them. Longleaf pine is well suited for either method, and the only pine effectively managed as an uneven-aged forest (a forest of many different aged trees with patches or clusters of even-aged trees). The life span of longleaf pine also allows the forest stand to be retained for a longer time.\nLearn more about multiple-value management.\nLongleaf pine is a low risk species to manage because it is able to survive damage from natural disasters that kill other pines. Its open crown, strong stem, and deep tap root make it windfirm and able to better withstand hurricanes and other storms. The thick bark of mature longleaf pine trees is also tolerant to wildfire. The longleaf pine is resistant to the major disease and insects that plaque loblolly pine, such as fusiform rust, pitch canker, annosus root rot, southern pine beetle and tip moth."

  "argos_summary": "Longleaf pine once dominated the southeastern U.S., covering ~90\u202fmillion acres, but intensive logging, turpentine extraction and land conversion have reduced its range to ~5\u202fmillion acres, leaving only 3\u202f% of its historic extent. The species is a keystone ecosystem, supporting over 800 endemic plants and species such as the gopher tortoise and red\u2011cockaded woodpecker, and its fire\u2011adapted ecology makes it resilient to hurricanes but vulnerable to fire suppression, invasive grasses, and climate change. Recent restoration initiatives\u2014led by groups like America\u2019s Longleaf, the Florida Forest Service, and the Florida Forever program\u2014have planted millions of trees, established new state forests such as Sandy Creek, and promoted prescribed burns to restore habitat connectivity and biodiversity.",
