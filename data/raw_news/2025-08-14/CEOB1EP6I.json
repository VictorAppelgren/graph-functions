  "content": "California will forge ahead with a plan to redraw its congressional district maps in a bid to give Democrats five more US House seats, a drastic move intended to neutralize a similar President Trump-backed effort underway by Texas Republicans.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced the anticipated measure in Los Angeles Thursday with a rally-like speech, where he ranted about supposed threats to democracy in America \u2014 despite support for his own redistricting plan falling across strictly partisan lines in the heavily blue state.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,\u201d Newsom said at the speech, confirming that state Democrats would soon officially declare a Nov. 4 special election to vote on the new maps.\n\nNewsom\u2019s plan mirrors a Trump-backed effort from Texas Gov. Greg Abbot to redraw its own congressional map and try to win the state five more Republican US House seats \u2014 all of which is part of a wider play to help the GOP hold unto its slim 219-212 seat majority during the midterm elections.\n\nSome Texas Democrats have left the state to avoid a vote on the matter, with the Trump administration even dispatching the FBI to bring the AWOL representatives back home.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama also waded into the debate, telling Texas Democrats on a video call that he \u201clauded their fight against the Republican efforts,\u201d a spokesperson told ABC News.\n\n\u201cHe made clear that they are part of a bigger effort to protect free and fair elections and commended them for inspiring others with their actions,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nNewsom said California\u2019s redrawing won\u2019t take effect unless Texas goes ahead with its own, but that he was ready to greenlight the plans if provoked.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump, you have poked the bear and we will punch back,\u201d said Newsom, who has been seen as a top contender to lead the Democrats\u2019 2028 presidential ticket.\n\nTexas restructuring first started after a federal court\u2019s new ruling on the Voting Rights Act rendered some of the state\u2019s districts illegal in June.\n\nIf Texas goes ahead with its plans and California follows, similar efforts could unfold across the country in other states and dramatically reshuffle congressional seating.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s new map proposals are expected to be unveiled Friday.\n\nNewsom\u2019s announcement \u2014 held at the Japanese American National Museum in LA\u2019s Little Tokyo \u2014 took a shocking turn when about 100 armed federal agents showed up outside, apparently to carry out an immigration enforcement operation nearby, KTLA reported.\n\n\u201cRight outside, at this exact moment, dozens and dozens of ice agents,\u201d said Newsom, flanked by Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla. \u201cDonald Trump, you think it\u2019s coincidental?\u201d\n\nThe operation was led by US Border Patrol Sector Commander Gregory K. Bovino, who seemed to brush off those accusations and said at least one illegal immigrant was detained.\n\n\u201cBreaking the law is not coincidental,\u201d he told NBC Los Angeles. \u201cBreaking the law is breaking the law.\u201d",

Bovino said the agency was conducting roving immigration enforcement patrols in the area.\n- At least one person was taken into custody during the operation in Little Tokyo.\n- Federal agents have carried out similar operations with regularity in Los Angeles and nearby communities since early June.\nDozens of U.S. Border Patrol gents showed up Thursday morning in downtown Los Angeles, where Gov. Gavin Newsom and other California political leaders were speaking at an event, and detained at least one person in the latest high-profile immigration enforcement operation in the city.\nStream Los Angeles News for free, 24/7, wherever you are.\nNewsom was speaking at the Democracy Center at the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo about a congressional redistricting map plan in response to Texas' redistricting effort. Masked and armed Border Agents in tactical gear arrived in on the streets outside the museum late Thursday morning.\nU.S. Border Patrol Sector Commander Gregory K. Bovino said the agency was conducting roving immigration enforcement patrols and one person was taken into custody. Video agents walking with a man whose hands were restrained behind his back.\nGet top local stories in Southern California delivered to you every morning with NBC LA's News Headlines newsletter.\nThe agents eventually left the area in the direction of a complex of federal buildings that includes the federal detention center.\nBovino told NBCLA Investigates that the man who was detained was in the country illegally.\nDetails about the federal law enforcement operation were not immediately available, but authorities have carried out similar operations with regularity in Los Angeles and nearby communities since early June.\nSens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff also spoke at the event inside the museum as the immigration enforcement operation unfolded outside. Newsom addressed the Border Patrol operation during his speech.\n\"Right outside, at this exact moment, dozens and dozens of ice agents,\" Newsom said. \"Donald Trump, you think it\u2019s coincidental? Donald Trump\u2019s minions, (border czar) Tom Homan, decided this was a location they\u2019d advance.\n\"Donald Trump, you have poked the bear. We will punch back.\"\nPadilla, who was forcibly removed earlier this year from a news conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles, spoke outside the cultural center.\n\"Trump, it's all about spectacle,\" Padilla said. \"Guess what? California is not going to be intimidated.\"\nIn addition to Newsom's speech at the museum, a midday ceremony was scheduled at the nearby Japanese American Cultural & Community Center in honor of three Japanese American brothers who served in World War II. The Akimoto brothers served in the war as their family was in forced internment under a World War II-era executive order.\nMayor Karen Bass showed up in the area and spoke with reporters.\n\"There is no way this was a coincidence,\" Mayor Karen Bass said. \"There was no reason in the world for them to come here. This is a complete provocation. This has nothing to do with safety. This is the exact opposite of keeping our city safe.\"\nBovino was asked whether the location of the Border Patrol presence was a coincidence.\n\"Breaking the law is not coincidental,\" Bovino said. \"Breaking the law is breaking the law.\"\nThe recent immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California are part of President Trump's campaign promise to carry out a mass deportation plan. The administration has highlighted arrests involving undocumented individuals with violent crime convictions. Those who have been caught up in the nationwide raids include asylum seekers, people who overstayed their visas and migrants awaiting their day in immigration court.\nThrough Aug. 1, nearly 56,600 migrants had been taken into ICE detention since the start of President Trump's second term, according NBC News, which used ICE data both public and internal as well as data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. About 29% of those in detention had criminal convictions; 24.7% had pending criminal charges; 46.8% were listed as \"other immigration violator;\" and 11.9% were fast-tracked for deportation."

      "text": "Why Gavin Newsom\u2019s wild plans for mid-decade congressional redistricting may blow up in his face\nGavin Newsom is going to war with the voters of California \u2014 and they might just hand him his head.\nThe ambitious governor of California says he is trying to end the presidency of Donald Trump two years early with a plan to elect more Democrats to the House of Representatives, offsetting a mid-decade redistricting in Texas. Newsom wants to call a special election to throw out the congressional maps drawn by the independent Citizens Redistricting Commission that voters established using the initiative power.\nThe initiative power in California goes back to 1911, when Republican Gov. Hiram Johnson said the people needed a way to deal with an indolent and corrupt legislature. He was half-governor, half-psychic.\nIn 2008, a majority of California voters were disgusted with incumbent politicians in Sacramento drawing self-serving district maps to guarantee their own re-election. Using the initiative power, voters revoked the legislature\u2019s map-drawing authority for state offices in 2008 and for congressional districts in 2010. The two ballot measures, Propositions 11 and 20, empowered a California Citizens Redistricting Commission to draw the district lines free from the control of politicians and lobbyists.\nOne drawback to excluding everyone in politics from serving on the Citizens Redistricting Commission is that the 14-member panel is advised by consultants who work closely with everyone in politics. The new system may not have protected incumbents but it seems to have tilted the playing field toward an ever-more-extreme Democratic party.\nVoters in California are nowhere near as wild-eyed leftist as the government they\u2019ve elected. President Trump received 6 million votes in the 2024 election, a little more than 38% of the total vote, but Republicans hold just 17% of the congressional seats, 24% of the California Assembly and 25% of the state Senate.\nEven Democratic voters in California are more conservative than the Democrats who control the government. Last year a tougher-on-crime initiative opposed by Newsom passed with more than 68% approval statewide, and a measure that would have made it easier for local governments to borrow money and raise property taxes went down to defeat by 10 points.\nNow Newsom is planning to ask voters to give more power to the leftist-Democrat legislature so it can draw congressional district maps that will give more power to leftist Democrats in Washington. Don\u2019t count on it.\nIn Republican-controlled Texas, redistricting is happening because of changes to the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of the Voting Rights Act. On July 7, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon sent a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott informing him that some of the state\u2019s congressional districts now violate the law. Abbott added redistricting to the agenda of a special session of the legislature.\nOn July 15, Trump spoke with Texas Republicans and encouraged them to draw the new district lines in a way that would give the GOP five more seats in Congress. Before the new maps could be approved by the Texas House in a scheduled Monday vote, dozens of Democratic members of the legislature bolted for other states, preventing the quorum needed to conduct legislative business.\n\u201cThis is what fighting for democracy looks like,\u201d Newsom wrote in an online post.\nAnd this is what craven ambition looks like: Newsom proposing a snap election to discard the citizen-drawn congressional maps and substitute maps drawn by politicians, with no transparency to the public, for the next three election cycles.\nThere is significant and high-profile opposition.\n\u201cAny attempt to undermine the nonpartisan California Redistricting Commission will be strongly opposed in the courts and at the ballot box,\u201d wrote Charles Munger, Jr., in an online post on July 16. Munger personally spent more than $12 million in support of Proposition 20. A website is already up at VotersFirstAct.org.\nAlso threatening a lawsuit is GOP candidate for governor Steve Hilton. And Politico reported that former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will be back to defend the citizen redistricting he championed.\nRoughly a dozen other states, including New York, are considering mid-decade redistricting. Gov. Hochul has said she\u2019ll \u201cfight fire with fire,\u201d but as in California, overriding the state\u2019s redistricting commission will require voter approval of a constitutional amendment.\nIt\u2019s 2024 all over again. Voters are the main obstacle to Democrats\u2019 plans to \u201csave democracy.\u201d\nSusan Shelley is a columnist for the Southern California News Group and VP of communications for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association."

      "text": "Texas Democrats get boost from Obama for blocking GOP redistricting plan\nThe former president said in a virtual meeting their action is inspiring others\nFormer President Barack Obama on Thursday joined a virtual meeting with Texas House Democrats who left the state to deny Republicans the ability to pass newly drawn GOP-favorable congressional maps, cheering on their efforts and stressing their work comes at a critical time in the fight against partisan gerrymandering.\nABC News is first to report on the meeting and its contents.\n\u201cWe can't let a systematic assault on democracy just happen and stand by and so because of your actions, because of your courage, what you've seen is California responding, other states looking at what they can do to offset this mid-decade gerrymandering,\u201d Obama told the Texas legislators as they gathered in Illinois.\nHe continued: \u201cI want all of you to be returning feeling invigorated and know that you have helped to lead what is going to be a long struggle. It's not going to be resolved right away, and it's going to require, ultimately, the American people understanding the stakes and realizing that we cannot take our freedoms and our democracy for granted. You've helped set the tone for that, and I'm grateful for it.\"\nHe continued: \u201cI want all of you to be returning feeling invigorated and know that you have helped to lead what is going to be a long struggle. It's not going to be resolved right away, and it's going to require, ultimately, the American people understanding the stakes and realizing that we cannot take our freedoms and our democracy for granted. You've helped set the tone for that, and I'm grateful for it.\"\nTexas Rep. Gene Wu, who chairs the state\u2019s House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement to ABC News that members were \u201cespecially excited\u201d about the meeting and Obama\u2019s involvement is proof that their actions are supported by their party \u201cat every level.\u201d\n\"Having President Obama speak with us and support us is proof that when Texas House Democrats stand up and fight back, we don't stand alone -- we have the support of Democrats at every level who understand that when Republicans attack voting rights in Texas, they're attacking the foundation of our democracy everywhere,\u201d Wu said.\nWu said Democrats had to hold the meeting virtually because of \"Republican threats,\" which he said is proof of desperation from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\u201cThe fact that we have to meet President Obama from an undisclosed location and via Zoom because of Republican threats and surveillance only proves how desperate Abbott and his extremist allies have become,\" Wu said. \"They know their racial gerrymandering scheme is falling apart, so they're resorting to intimidation tactics. But President Obama's support shows the whole country is watching -- and Texas House Democrats won't be silenced by bullies.\u201d\nObama was joined on the call by former Attorney General Eric Holder, who chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC). During the conversation, Holder updated the caucus on his committee\u2019s plans to push back on Republican efforts to encourage other red states to redraw congressional maps more favorable to Republicans to get an edge for the midterms.\nThe former president will continue to highlight the ongoing redistricting standoffs later this month when he headlines a fundraiser in Martha\u2019s Vineyard hosted by the NDRC.\nHolder and Speaker Emerita Rep. Nancy Pelosi will also attend the event, which is scheduled for Aug. 19.\nWu said Thursday that the group could return to the state soon on two conditions: if the legislature\u2019s first special session adjourns Friday and if California Democrats introduce their redistricting proposal that would offset proposed Texas maps. Both of those instances are likely to happen Friday.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Thursday that he was moving forward with putting proposed new congressional maps for the state on the ballot in a Nov. 4 special election in an attempt to counter Texas\u2019 plans.\nHe said state government will affirm its commitment to California\u2019s independent redistricting commission after the 2030 census, \u201cbut we're asking the voters for their consent to do midterm redistricting in 2026, 2028, and 2030 for the congressional maps to respond to what's happening in Texas \u2026 and we'll do so in a way that also affirms our desire as a state to level the playing field all across the United States.\u201d\nThe California legislature will have to pass legislation to put the redrawn maps on the ballot.\nABC News\u2019 Oren Oppenheim contributed to this report."

Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\u201d she added. \u201cYou will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\u201d\nDunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division \u2014 which handles cases of fugitives abroad and helps foreign countries on extradition matters with their own fugitives, according to the DOJ.\nDunn appeared to have been similar to a paralegal \u2014 assisting attorneys in handling a \u201clarge volume of cases, including the litigation of those matters,\u201d according to the DOJ\u2019s job listing for the position.\nHe does not appear to be an attorney as his name isn\u2019t listed on the DC bar\u2019s website.\nAn attorney for the suspect did not immediately respond to requests for comment and attempts to contact Dunn directly were unsuccessful.\nDunn was allegedly caught on camera berating a group of federal officers as \u201cfascists\u201d before lobbing his deli sandwich and hitting a US Customs and Border Protection agent in the chest.\n\u201cF\u2014 you! You f\u2014ing fascists! Why are you here? I don\u2019t want you in my city!\u201d Dunn allegedly fumed within inches of an officer\u2019s face, per a criminal complaint.\nAccording to the complaint, Dunn successfully attempted to flee on foot, telling a local cop while he was being processed: \u201cI did it. I threw a sandwich.\u201d\nFootage of the incident went viral against the backdrop of President Trump\u2019s deployment of hundreds of federal law enforcement personnel to assist DC police in cracking down on crime.\nDunn faces one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer and faces up to one year in prison if convicted.\n\u201cThe police are not out there to get pushed around or beat up,\u201d DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro declared in announcing the case against Dunn. \u201cHe thought it was funny. Well, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny today because we charged him with a felony: Assault on a police officer.\u201d\n\u201cSo there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else!\u201d\nOn Monday, Trump federalized the DC Metropolitan Police Department for 30 days and activated the National Guard to patrol the District\u2019s streets.\nSince then, hundreds of federal officials have arrested more than 100 suspects, with 23 collared on Monday, 43 nabbed on Tuesday and 45 apprehended on Wednesday, according to data from the Trump administration.\nTrump\u2019s crackdown comes after former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee Edward Coristine \u2014 aka \u201cBig Balls\u201d \u2014 was beaten up while intervening to prevent a carjacking last week."

      "text": "FBI helping Texas law enforcement locate \u2018rogue\u2019 Dems who fled state redistricting session\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The FBI is now assisting Texas authorities with finding \u201crogue\u201d Democrats who fled the state to stall a redistricting effort, according to a bureau spokesperson.\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) had requested FBI involvement after the 57 legislators decamped to blue states \u2014 including Illinois, Massachusetts and New York \u2014 in the middle of a special session convened to redraw congressional maps.\n\u201cI am proud to announce that Director Kash Patel has approved my request for the FBI to assist state and local law enforcement in locating runaway Texas House Democrats,\u201d Cornyn said in a statement after asking the feds to help round up the \u201cpotential lawbreakers.\u201d\n\u201cI thank President Trump and Director Patel for supporting and swiftly acting on my call for the federal government to hold these supposed lawmakers accountable for fleeing Texas. We cannot allow these rogue legislators to avoid their constitutional responsibilities.\u201d\nThe Texas Dems\u2019 absence prevented the state legislature from establishing a quorum necessary to consider the redistricting and other bills, with several decrying the GOP\u2019s effort as an attempt to secure more seats in next year\u2019s midterms.\n\u201cI will liken this to the Holocaust,\u201d Texas Democratic state Rep. Jolanda Jones said Tuesday, before issuing an apology for the unhinged comparison between partisan politicking and the slaughter of more than 6 million Jews by the Nazis.\nRepublican Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows set a Friday deadline for the runaway Democrats to reappear before \u201cjudicial orders\u201d are sought declaring that they have \u201cvacated their office.\u201d\nPresident Trump had indicated Tuesday that the FBI \u201cmay have to\u201d get involved to force the runaway legislators back to Austin.\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott ordered state authorities Monday to \u201carrest\u201d the \u201cdelinquent Texas House Democrats\u201d and bring them back for the special legislative session in the state\u2019s capital.\n\u201cAs we\u2019re talking right now, Texas Department of Public Safety officers are on the streets looking for those Democrat House members to arrest them and to take them to the Texas capitol and hold them there until a quorum is reached,\u201d Abbott told Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Will Cain Show\u201d on Tuesday.\nCornyn\u2019s Tuesday letter to Patel also expressed concerns \u201cthat legislators who solicited or accepted funds to aid in their efforts to avoid their legislative duties may be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a probe into any \u201cunlawful activity\u201d by former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s political group that could have aided state Dems.\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s Powered by People PAC, founded in 2019 during his failed Democratic presidential bid, may have run afoul of state bribery laws by \u201cbankrolling\u201d the trip by Texas House Democrats who flew to deep-blue Illinois to meet with Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker.\n\u201cAny Democrat coward breaking the law by taking a Beto Bribe will be held accountable,\u201d Paxton said in a statement. \u201cTexas cannot be bought. I look forward to thoroughly reviewing all of the documents and communications obtained throughout this investigation.\u201d\nAbbott indicated on \u201cThe Will Cain Show\u201d Tuesday that state Democrats who took financial assistance for their trip could be removed from office.\nPritzker got a dose of his own medicine later Tuesday during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d when the lame-duck late night host confronted the Illinois governor with a map of his state\u2019s own gerrymandered House districts.\n\u201cTake a look at this. Look at [District] 17 here. It does that, then it comes up here and it sneaks around there and goes all the way up here, and then goes right over there like that. And look at this one, kind of goes whoop up there,\u201d Colbert noted, brandishing a map of Illinois\u2019 congressional boundaries.\nOne looked like \u201cthe stinger on a scorpion,\u201d the recently canceled CBS host noted.\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said, everything\u2019s on the table,\u201d Pritzker told Colbert, suggesting Illinois Democrats could convene their own special session to mark up new district lines.\nRedistricting usually occurs through state legislatures or independent commissions every 10 years after a census is released.\nIn recent years, Texas, Pennsylvania and North Carolina have convened special sessions before the decennial population count to make new boundaries, which drew legal challenges."

She accompanied the story with the Notorious B.I.G. song \u201cAnother,\u201d featuring Lil\u2019 Kim, which details an affair.\n\u201cWhat do you do when your man is untrue? Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?\u201d Lil\u2019 Kim raps in the portion of the song Biden shared on social media.\nThe dark-haired man in a casual short-sleeved shirt and the blond woman in a strapless black dress are not immediately identifiable, but Biden\u2019s message was clear.\nSunday morning\u2019s Instagram Story \u2014 which was quickly taken down \u2014 came just hours before Biden filed for a divorce from the 58-year-old plastic surgeon in a Philadelphia court after 13 years of marriage.\nAnother since-deleted Instagram Story, showing Biden walking through a park giving a thumbs-up to the tune of Beyonce\u2019s song \u201cFreedom,\u201d also appeared to allude to the split.\nIn a subsequent story accompanied by the Lauryn Hill song \u201cFreedom Time,\u201d she reposted a quote, \u201cNew life, new beginnings means new boundaries. New ways of being that won\u2019t look or sound like they did before.\u201d\nFormer President Joe Biden\u2019s daughter is seeking spousal support from her ex as part of the divorce, court records seen by Radar Online show.\nBiden, executive director of the nonprofit Delaware Center for Justice, is \u201cunable to sustain herself\u201d while the divorce is pending, according to the documents filed by her attorney Charles Meyer.\nShe is requesting a no-fault divorce, claiming that the marriage is \u201cirretrievably broken,\u201d and that the couple are living \u201cseparate and apart,\u201d the documents show.\nBiden and Krein did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.\nThe couple married in 2012 in Greenville, Delaware, two years after meeting through Ashley\u2019s late brother, Beau, who died of cancer in 2015.\nKrein, a New Jersey-born otolaryngologist at Thomas Jefferson University, proposed in 2011 at Big Sur, California.\nThey married at Delaware\u2019s St. Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic Church in a ceremony combining her traditions with Krein\u2019s Jewish ones, before the couple and some 200 guests traveled to the Biden family\u2019s nearby lakeside home in Wilmington for a reception and dinner.\nJoe Biden, who was vice president at the time, personally prepped the house for his youngest child\u2019s wedding.\n\u201cI kept telling Ash, we\u2019ve got to open up the church and practice walking up and down the aisle so I can handle it,\u201d he previously told People.\nHe was also full of praise for his future son-in-law, saying, \u201cThis is the right guy. And he\u2019s getting a helluva woman.\u201d\nKrein also served on the Biden Cancer Initiative\u2019s board of directors between 2017 and 2019, and advised his 2020 presidential campaign on its response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an unofficial capacity.\nAt last year\u2019s DNC in Chicago, Ashley Biden recounted her wedding day and discussed her father\u2019s words to her before she tied the knot.\n\u201cBefore he walked me down the aisle, he turned to me and said he would always be my best friend.

      "text": "Chuck Todd warns America is heading towards a \u2018cold civil war\u2019 amid ongoing redistricting battles\nFormer NBC host Chuck Todd argued that America is heading towards a \u201ccold civil war\u201d on \u201cThe Chuck Toddcast\u201d on Tuesday as redistricting battles in states like Texas and California continue to rage.\nTodd contended that the ongoing redistricting battles are \u201cjust the latest skirmish between what is turning into a cold civil war,\u201d and that it is President Donald Trump and the Republican Party who are \u201ccreating this unprecedented challenge to our constitutional republic.\u201d\n\u201cI hate using that rhetoric. I hate using those words, but what else are you going to describe it? We are literally having a redistricting war between the states right now, and we have governors who have decided they don\u2019t care about the minority rights in their own states,\u201d Todd argued.\n\u201cGreg Abbott doesn\u2019t care. If you don\u2019t agree with Greg Abbott, he is going to force his will upon you in the state of Texas. And if you don\u2019t agree with Gavin Newsom and how they\u2019re going \u2014 he\u2019s going to force his will upon you,\u201d he added.\nThe former NBC host stated that \u201cthis is not what the founders intended,\u201d placing blame on both sides of the aisle, but focusing in on Trump as the primary catalyst for what he describes as a \u201ccold civil war.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not a policy fight. This isn\u2019t the usual partisan back and forth. It is a direct stress test of whether our constitutional system actually works when a president and his party decide they don\u2019t have to care about the limits that are written down on paper,\u201d he asserted.\n\u201cTrump has spent years \u2014 parts of his first term and much so far of these first 200-plus days bending and breaking the guard rails of the republic.\u201d\nWhile Todd criticized the Trump administration\u2019s use of federal power and Texas Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s redistricting efforts, he also took issue with the Democrats\u2019 \u2018fight fire with fire\u2019 approach to these perceived problems.\n\u201cThe Democratic response is pretty troubling because, right now as a party, okay, as an official party apparatus, they\u2019ve decided to frame this moment as a war, right? Okay, you got to fight fire with fire. This is an unprecedented moment, so they\u2019re framing this as a war,\u201d he stated.\n\u201cAnd when you tell yourself you\u2019re in a war, you start rationalizing things you\u2019d normally not do that you would say is immoral or wrong or unprincipled. But hey, it\u2019s war and all is fair in war, right?\u201d\nTodd noted that Democrats have championed independent commissions and wanted competitive district mapping for years, but now with Republicans \u201copenly wanting to break the rules like they\u2019re doing in Texas,\u201d Democrats are also looking to \u201cbreak the rules\u201d with their own redistricting efforts.\n\u201cAnd if you criticize that decision, as I\u2019ve been doing, I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m naive, that I don\u2019t understand the stakes, that you are not taking this threat seriously,\u201d he railed.\n\u201cAu contraire, my friend, I do God \u2013 understand the stakes, and we are not replacing one unprincipled, unconstitutional set of leaders with another set of unprincipled, unconstitutional set of leaders.\u201d\nIn closing, Todd called on Republican members of Congress to \u201ccheck\u201d Trump\u2019s power and use the tools afforded to them by the Constitution to hold him accountable for the \u201cunconstitutional\u201d actions he has taken while in office.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve not lifted one finger of oversight. Not one\u2026 You couldn\u2019t even say there\u2019ve been a weak check on Trump. It has been no check on him at all,\u201d he asserted.\n\u201cGuess what? The Constitution can\u2019t enforce itself without people willing to wield those checks. All we have are words on yellowing parchment paper.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to redraw congressional district maps to potentially gain five additional Democratic seats, countering a similar effort by Texas Republicans backed by former President Trump. The move, set for a special election on November 4, is seen as a response to Texas Democrats fleeing the state to block redistricting efforts. Newsom's proposal has sparked controversy, with critics arguing it undermines the independent redistricting commission established by voters. The situation reflects a broader national struggle over redistricting and partisan power dynamics.",
