  "title": "Why rising Black unemployment should worry us all",
  "description": "Black unemployment is becoming a noticeable crack in the U.S. economy",
  "content": "There's an old saying in the Black community: last hired, first fired.\n\nAnd the way the U.S. labor market is looking there might be reason to believe that is happening.\n\nGreetings, This Is America readers, Phillip M. Bailey here.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons the job market is being called resilient, but a noticeable crack has emerged among Black Americans, who have reached their highest level of unemployment since the COVID-19 pandemic days.\n\nThe jobless rate for hit 7.2% in July among Black workers, up from 6.3% a year ago and 6.8% the month before, according to the most recent jobs report. It's a troubling sign mainly because historically speaking Black people are often hit first economic downturns.\n\n\"The Black unemployment rate is always the first to go up. That\u2019s always the canary in the coal mine, Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told USA TODAY.\n\nFor more on what's happening in the U.S. economy, check out the USA TODAY Network's coverage:\n\u2022 Gen Z's financial wake up call: Younger Americans are learning about budgeting, saving, and struggling\n\u2022 What's keeping Americans up at night: Duh! Bills, debt and inflation -- we spend 4 hours a day worrying\n\u2022 The heir's property: Speaking of Black America, here's one man's fight to reclaim family land in the South\n\nDon't take your eyes off Texas and their attempts to redraw congressional maps.\n\nThis is a fight that could determine the future of Donald Trump's presidency, but also one that might open up a larger conflict among Democratic and Republican-controlled states.\n\nPrompted by the prospect of losing control of Congress, the president wants a rare mid-decade redistricting in Texas, where Republicans have come up with boundaries for U.S. House districts that could give the GOP five more seats.\n\nNow more than 50 Texas Democratic legislators have skipped town to break quorum, and Trump's allies want to send the FBI after them in order to bring them back to Austin, the Lone Star State's capitol.\n\nBoth parties are portraying this as a battle for the future of the country that could expand to other states, as Trump administration officials -- namely Vice President JD Vance -- visited Indiana to urge Republicans there to do the same thing as Texas.\n\nAsked if any agreement had been reached on making new maps for the Hoosier State, Gov. Mike Braun said \"we listened.\"\n\nDon't forget blue state governors in California, Illinois and New York are thinking about adopting this same strategy, which ultimately will make Congress even more divided.\n\nThanks for reading! See you back next week with more stories of justice from across the country. You can find me on social @phillipmbailey.",

      "text": "'A part-time job': Americans spend nearly 4 hours a day thinking about money\n- Americans spend nearly four hours a day thinking about their finances, with many experiencing increased financial stress compared to last year.\n- Top financial concerns include bills, inflation, housing costs, and debt, varying by generation.\n- Younger generations, particularly Gen Z and Millennials, spend more time worrying about money and experience more sleep disruption due to financial concerns.\nBetween bills to pay, tariff news and inflation worries, money is living rent-free in Americans\u2019 minds.\nThey\u2019re spending nearly four hours a day on average thinking about it, according to new research from Empower, a financial services company.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a part-time job,\u201d said Rebecca Rickert, head of communications and consumer insights at Empower.\nAt 54%, a little more than half of the 2,206 adults surveyed said they\u2019re thinking about it more than they did last year. In fact, the June survey found 53% of Americans said they\u2019re feeling financial stress \"more acutely than ever,\" including 62% of Gen Xers and 41% of baby boomers.\nWith banking and investment apps a tap away on their phones, 17% of Americans are checking their financial accounts multiple times a day, and 24% check their bank account daily.\nThe high level of surveillance is more common among younger generations: 24% of Gen Zers and 21% of millennials are looking at their accounts several times a day, compared with 10% of baby boomers.\n\u201cPeople are checking their accounts like they check the weather,\u201d Rickert said.\nWhat exactly are Americans thinking about?\nTop of mind for most Americans is, of course, upcoming and due payments \u2013 57% of Americans report they\u2019re thinking about bills.\nInflation and rising prices also are taking up headspace for 51% of Americans. Of those surveyed, 34% are thinking about housing costs, 30% are thinking about debt, 28% are thinking about tariffs, and 24% are thinking about retirement savings.\n\u201cPeople are carrying more financial pressure as they face external factors that are beyond their control, like market uncertainty, while managing multiple priorities like debt, everyday expenses, and savings \u2013 even if their income hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Lisa Frison, head of financial inclusion at Citi, told USA TODAY.\nChief worries for younger generations are housing costs, job security and debt, Rickert said. Meanwhile, older generations are thinking about retirement savings and reserves, like their emergency cash.\nYounger Americans spend more time worrying\nTime spent thinking about money varies by generation, and it appears to decline as Americans grow older.\nGen Z spends the most time thinking about money, averaging 4.82 hours a day. Millennials follow close behind, averaging 4.73 hours a day. Money still weighs heavily on Gen Xers\u2019 and baby boomers\u2019 minds, but they aren\u2019t thinking as much about it: They average 3.74 hours and 2.4 hours a day, respectively.\nJack Howard, head of financial wellness at Ally Financial, said Gen Zers are unique because they grew up having more information at their fingertips thanks to the internet and are \u201ccomparing themselves against the world\u201d thanks to social media.\n\"Which is good because we want you to get the information and use it. But I wonder if it\u2019s also creating an overload of anxiety,\u201d Howard said. \u201cSocial media creates some level of competition.\u201d\nWhen are Americans thinking about money?\nThe topic is so stressful that 36% of Americans report losing sleep over their financial worries. Millennials may be getting the least rest: 44% report that money worries are keeping them up. Baby boomers are faring better at night; only 24% report it affects their sleep.\nMoney concerns don\u2019t stop during the day. The survey found that 38% of respondents said financial worries interfered with their ability to focus and put a strain on their relationships.\nGen Zers are most likely to think about money between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., while millennials and Gen Xers are often worrying about their finances before bed, between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m.\nIs money stress motivating?\nClose to half of Americans report that thinking about money helps them take action to reach their long-term goals, and 47% said they feel confident they\u2019ll reach them.\nAnother 30% reported feeling neutral, or on the fence, about whether they\u2019ll reach their long-term goals. In the meantime, many Americans are seeking financial advice and information.\nMore than half reported following financial news to stay informed, commonly researching topics including inflation, budgeting and saving. A third said talking with a financial adviser helps clarify their financial goals.\nStill, Frison cautions people against ruminating over their finances and thinking too much about past mistakes or missed opportunities, which can lead to frustration but not solutions.\n\u201cIt's unhelpful when thinking about money becomes an infinite loop, so the key is to shift from stress to structure, even with one small move,\u201d Frison told USA TODAY.\nWhat helps ease financial pressure\nAsked what would ease their money worries, nearly half of the survey respondents said a higher income, and 45% said lower living expenses.\nBut 29% also wished for \u201cbroader economic improvements,\u201d and 28% pointed to debt elimination. Nearly a quarter said a larger emergency fund would help, and 18% said a detailed financial plan would have a positive impact.\nSuppose money is taking up more mental headspace than you'd like. In that case, Frison recommends doing a personal financial audit, building small habits over time, and asking friends, family or a professional for help.\n\u201cWhen people are in a silo on these things, it makes it difficult to take action,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the shame comes in.\u201d\nShe and Rickert emphasized the importance of people shifting from passive worrying to taking action \u2013 whether that\u2019s starting to pay down debt or contributing to a 401(k) \u2013 to better their financial situation and relieve stress.\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_"

      "text": "Waiting for a Fed rate cut? Chair Powell offered few signals of one, economists say\nAt least on the surface, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell played it straight down the middle on the big question looming over the central bank's decision to hold rates steady for a fifth straight meeting.\nWill the central bank be ready to resume its rate cuts in September as futures markets and many economists have expected?\n\u201cWe have made no decision about September,\u201d Powell told reporters. He said the economic data will guide Fed officials, noting there will be two more inflation reports and two more jobs reports by the mid-September meeting.\nHe also gave a nod to risks on both sides of the ledger. Raising rates too early could reignite inflation, reversing the progress made since pandemic-related product and worker shortages drove inflation to a 40 year high of 9.1% in 2022. Waiting too long could allow a the labor market to weaken significantly.\nPowell specifically cited \u201cdownside risks to the labor market.\u201d\nWhen can we expect interest rates to go down?\nYet, while the economy's course over the next six weeks will determine what the Fed does, many forecasters and futures markets believe Powell delivered a \u201chawkish\u201d message Wednesday that reduces the chances officials will be ready to act in September.\nAfter the Fed's July 30 meeting, fed funds futures lowered the odds of a September cut to 45% from about 65%.\n\u201cWe think the uncertainty and balance of risks will push most of the committee to remain in wait-and-see mode at least a few months longer, with the next rate cut not coming until December,\u201d economist Michael Pearce of Oxford economics wrote in a note to clients.\nHow do high interest rates affect consumers?\nFor millions of Americans, that would mean relatively high borrowing costs on auto loans, credit card balances, mortgages and other debt would persist, at least for a few more months. But it also would mean higher bank savings rates for seniors and other people who depend on fixed income assets.\nAmid an already slowing job market and economy, the Fed chief previously has acknowledged officials likely would be cutting rates now that inflation has eased but is waiting to see how much President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs feed into consumer prices.\nThat could take a while.\nThe Fed lowers rates to bolster a sagging economy and raises rates or keeps them higher longer to head off inflation.\nHere\u2019s why forecasters think Powell sent a cautious message about lowering rates in the near term:\n- Powell noted that while the labor market is at the Fed\u2019s target of full employment - with unemployment at just 4.1% - inflation, at 2.7%, is still above the 2% goal. \u201cThat calls for modestly restrictive, in my way of thinking, modestly restrictive stance right now,\u201d he said.\n- Despite the Fed's higher-than-normal interest rates, \u201cThe economy is not performing as (if) restrictive policy is holding it back inappropriately,\u201d Powell said. That doesn't sound like a Fed chief worried that high rates are hurting consumers and businesses. It \u201csuggested he sees little reason to (trim rates) soon,\u201d economist Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.\n- Even though job growth is slowing, Powell noted labor supply growth is also downshifting because of Trump's immigration crackdown. That's keeping the unemployment rate steady at a low level, and Powell said the jobless rate should be the Fed's main focus. In other words, low unemployment could keep the Fed from reducing rates soon despite meager job gains, Pearce said.\n- Powell initially seemed to throw a bone to rate-cut advocates. \u201cA reasonable base case is that the effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level,\" he said. That sounds like a rate cut could be around the corner. But then he added, \u201cIt is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed.\u201d\n- By September, \u201cOur view is that there won't be enough in the data to convince the committee that tariffs will prove to be a one off lift to inflation, or that the labor market is weakening decisively enough to warrant loosening policy,\u201d Pearce wrote.\n- The effects of tariffs on inflation could take a good bit more time to play out, Powell said. \u201cWe're still a ways away from seeing where things settle down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn't feel like we're close to the end of that process.\u201d\n- Nothing tariffs are starting to push up prices, Powell said the Fed is already \u201clooking through\u201d goods inflation by not raising rates. That \u201ccould be pushback to those who might want lower rates now,\" economist Michael Feroli of JP Morgan Chase wrote to clients.\n(This story was updated to correct a typo)"

      "text": "July jobs report reveals employers added 73,000 jobs; unemployment rises\nU.S. employers added a disappointing 73,000 jobs in July as payroll growth slowed amid President Donald Trump's sweeping import tariffs, intensifying immigration crackdown and massive federal layoffs.\nEven more concerning: Job gains for May and June were revised down by a whopping 258,000, portraying a much weaker labor market than believed in late spring and early summer and raising the odds the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.\nThe unemployment rate rose from 4.1% to 4.2%, the Labor Department announced on Friday, Aug. 1.\nBefore the report was released, economists had estimated that 105,000 jobs were added in July.\n\"The cracks in the labor market have widened substantially and add further pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates,\u201d Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic wrote in a note to clients.\nHow's the job market right now?\nEconomists believed the labor market has been remarkably resilient in recent months despite Trump's economic policies, adding well over 100,000 jobs per month from April through June. But payroll gains for May have now been revised from 144,000 to 19,000 and June\u2019s additions were downgraded from 147,000 to 14,000.\nOver the past three months, U.S. job gains have averaged just 35,000.\n\"To me, today\u2019s jobs report is what entering a recession looks like,\" Josh Bivens, chief economist of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said in a statement.\nWhile layoffs have remained low, hiring has been soft and fell to a 12-month low in June. June's overall job gains appeared to be bolstered by state and local government hiring but even that silver lining has faded with the outsize revisions to job growth in the spring.\nThe dismal report adds to a dimming outlook for the U.S. economy. The broader economy grew at a healthy 3% annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said the week of July 28. But the numbers were pumped up by the reversal of a tariff-related surge in imports that caused the economy to contract early in the year.\nWhat industries are in high demand?\nHealth care, a reliable job generator the past couple of years, again drove the payroll gains with 55,000 but few other sectors added jobs. Professional and business services lost 14,000; manufacturing shed 11,000 and leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants and bars, added just 5,000. For months, private-sector job creation has been concentrated in health care, leisure and hospitality and little else.\nIn July, businesses added a relatively meager 83,000 jobs but it marked progress compared to the paltry 3,000 added in June following the latest revisions. Economist Thomas Ryan of Capital Economics said it may be a sign of firms feeling more confident adding workers as uncertainty from Trump's early April \"Liberation Day\" reciprocal tariffs has eased.\nIs there a federal hiring freeze in 2025?\nMeanwhile, the federal government is shedding workers in droves, shedding 12,000 in July and a total of 84,000 since January. A federal hiring freeze was extended from July to October, while 154,000 federal employees have accepted buyouts and tens of thousands more have been laid off. Only a small portion of the layoffs have shown up in the monthly job numbers because they were being challenged in court. The Supreme Court, however, recently lifted that injunction, possibly curtailing employment further last month, Capital Economics said.\nGoldman Sachs, though, said the high court ruling likely came too late to affect Labor\u2019s July survey.\nHow do tariffs affect the job market?\nPrivate-sector hiring has been sluggish and increasingly concentrated in just a few sectors, such as health care and leisure and hospitality. Trump's tariffs have generated uncertainty about their impact on consumer prices and spending, as well as corporate profit margins, causing many businesses to hold off hiring.\nPrivate companies added fewer than 100,000 jobs in June. Manufacturers, which have been hit hardest by the import fees, lost an average of 5,000 jobs a month in the April-June quarter, Goldman noted.\nJuly 31, ahead of a midnight negotiating deadline, the White House announced it would maintain its base 10% tariff on imports from 100 countries but push the fee to 15% for another 40 nations and up to 40% for an additional 30 countries. Economists have estimated the average U.S. tariff would leap from about 3% early this year to 15% to 20% and possibly higher, driving a key inflation measure from 2.8% to upwards of 3%.\nHow do deportations affect the labor market?\nArrests and deportations of migrants who lack permanent legal status have picked up, hampering hiring in industries such as agriculture, construction and leisure and hospitality. From March through May, those sectors lost an average of 7,000 jobs a month, Goldman said.\nDeportations may have ratcheted up further in July after the Supreme Court lifted a judge's order requiring that migrants be granted the chance to show they would be harmed if removed to certain countries, Capital Economics said.\nThe crackdown, which also restricts the flow of migrants to the U.S., has served as the biggest factor in a labor force that has shrunk by more than 300,000 since January, said economist Dante DeAntonio of Moody\u2019s Analytics.\nThe labor force participation rate - the share of Americans working or looking for jobs dimmed to 62.2% last month, the lowest since November 2022.\nOn the one hand, a smaller workforce curbs hiring since employers attract fewer job candidates. But it also has kept the unemployment rate from rising as weaker employer demand is balanced by a smaller pool of job seekers, DeAntonio said.\nContributing: Joey Garrison; Reuters"

      "text": "Unemployment among Black Americans can be an early sign of economic strain. It\u2019s rising\nThe surge in unemployment among Black Americans could be a troubling sign for the economy, since this segment is often the first hit by economic downturns.\nEconomists have viewed the U.S. labor market as resilient in recent months, but some warn that cracks have started to emerge \u2013 including among the country's Black workforce.\nThe unemployment rate for Black Americans hit 7.2% in July, up from 6.3% a year ago and 6.8% the month before, according to the most recent jobs report from the Labor Department. The most recent surge follows an eye-popping 13% increase from May to June and puts the metric well above the total unemployment rate of 4.2%.\nBlack women in particular have seen a dramatic increase in unemployment over the past year, from 5.5% to 6.3%. Certain states are also seeing exceptionally high unemployment rates for Black people, and some, including Michigan, are hovering near 10%, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.\nEconomists say the unemployment surge for Black Americans this year could be a troubling sign for the economy at large, because this segment is often the first hit by economic downturns. Other ethnic groups may already be seeing the effects of a weakening labor market; unemployment rates among White, Asian and Hispanic or Latino workers ticked up 0.1, 0.4 and 0.2 percentage points in July, respectively. Plus, the picture of a strong labor market took a hit with the release of the most recent jobs report, which showed payroll gains for May and June were revised down by 258,000.\n\"The Black unemployment rate is always the first to go up. That\u2019s always the canary in the coal mine,\u201d said Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nWhy are unemployment rates among Black workers increasing?\nEconomists told USA TODAY job cuts within the federal government could be hitting Black workers especially hard because they make up a significant share of the workforce.\nOverall, Black Americans account for 18% of the federal workforce as of September, compared with 12% of the overall workforce, according to a National Women\u2019s Law Center report in May. Black employees make up an even larger share at some of the agencies that have seen some of the most severe job cuts, like the Department of Education (36%), U.S. Agency for International Development (21%) and the Health and Human Services Department (20.5%), according to September figures from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.\nThe difference is even more stark for Black women, who made up roughly 12% of the federal workforce, nearly twice their participation rate in the civilian labor force, according to 2021 data from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\u201cThis has been a place where Black people are disproportionately more likely to get jobs \u2013 better jobs, well-paying jobs,\u201d Ajilore said.\nEconomists point to business uncertainty under the country\u2019s shifting trade policy as another potential driver as companies pause major decisions like hiring until they have a better understanding of how tariffs will affect their bottom line. A recent survey from the National Association for Business Economics found 1 in 4 companies plan to delay hiring or investments over the next six months.\nThe Trump administration's push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs in the federal government, education and the private sector also could play a role in the recent unemployment figures, creating an \u201cantagonistic posture against the Black workforce\" that may be hurting Black hiring rates, said Andre Perry, a senior fellow and director of the Center for Community Uplift at the Brookings Institution.\nDEI programs often fell short of their goal to close racial gaps \u2013 Black Americans are still outnumbered 12 to 1 by White people in executive roles, for instance. But the pullback may still impact Black Americans' careers and the diversity of executive suites. USA TODAY has reported that in 2023, as the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions and conservative groups targeted DEI efforts at dozens of companies, the ranks of Black executives fell 3% from the year before, twice the rate of White executives.\n\"It\u2019s one of those things where I think it plays a role (in this year's unemployment data), but it\u2019s so difficult to actually pinpoint,\u201d Ajilore said. \"There's no smoking gun.\"\nAnd while Black employees have benefited from a tight labor market in recent years, he said, they may now be more at risk of \"last hired, first fired,\" or the practice of letting the most recently hired employees first as the labor market cools.\nWhich states have the highest unemployment rates among Black Americans?\nCertain communities have seen even more dramatic unemployment gains among Black workers.\nIn Michigan, the unemployment rate for Black people hit 10% in the first quarter \u2013 nearly double the state's total unemployment rate and up 3.2% from 2020, according to the Economic Policy Institute. South Carolina\u2019s rate jumped 3% to 6.9% in that time frame.\nSouth Dakota, Alabama and Maryland had some of the lowest rates at 2.8%, 4.3% and 4.3%, respectively.\n\u201cThe aggregate (labor market) numbers really mask what\u2019s going on at the local level,\u201d Perry said. \u201cSo you see in some places, Black people are in a recession by the looks of it. In other places, Black employment is faring much better.\u201d\nIs this a warning for the economy?\nElizabeth Crofoot, senior economist and principal researcher at Lightcast, said the employment data is \u201calarming.\" Though she noted it was unclear based on earlier figures if the unemployment surge for Black Americans was caused by blips in the data from small sample sizes, she said July's data paints a more detailed picture of declining Black labor force participation.\n\"The labor market data from BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics), it\u2019s volatile month to month \u2013 especially because those response rates are not as high as they used to be, so there is a lot of noise in the data,\u201d she said. But \"this is looking like an emerging trend.\"\nThat could spell bad news for the economy at large. Crofoot said unemployment among Black people tends to rise first in a weakening economy, \"oftentimes due to equity issues.\"\nShe pointed to occupational segregation \u2012 when different demographic groups are more likely to be concentrated in certain parts of the workforce \u2012 as one driver, pointing to how Black employees have a stronger presence in some of the industries that have seen job declines such as the federal workforce, manufacturing (which shed 11,000 jobs between June and July) and wholesale trade (which lost 7,800 jobs).\n\"There are certain sectors of the economy where there are more African Americans ... and typically those jobs are also not the best jobs,\" she said. \"Especially in retail, for example, or lower-end health care sector jobs.\"\nAjilore pointed to Labor Department data that shows more than 300,000 Black women lost their jobs in the first half of 2025 as another sign the rise could be the start of a long-term trend.\nRising unemployment for Black Americans may not be the only crack in the labor market data. Recent graduates have struggled to find work amid the rise of artificial intelligence and business uncertainty related to tariffs. And job gains this year have been concentrated in areas like health care, leisure and hospitality, and among state and local governments.\nOverall, U.S. employers added just 73,000 jobs in July, below the 105,000 economists expected.\n\"The labor market is slowing down,\" Ajilore said. \"It's one of those things where looking at Black unemployment rate and Black labor market indicators told us this story was coming.\"\nContributing: Jessica Guynn and Jayme Fraser"

      "text": "Why Trump's political war in Texas is much bigger than the Lone Star State\nSpurred on by Trump, Texas Republicans redrew the boundary lines for U.S. House seats in the state. The new map creates five more GOP-leaning seats.\n- \u201cAs goes Texas, so goes the nation,\" said Texas state Rep. Brian Harrison, a former Trump administration official.\n- Califoria Gov. Gavin Newsom said a Democratic House majority would be the \"de facto\" end of Trump's second term.\nThe future of Donald Trump's presidency may be decided in Texas in the coming weeks.\nA nasty fight in the Lone Star State over redrawing U.S. House districts could decide whether Trump is politically neutered after the 2026 midterms.\nDemocrats see next year's election as an opportunity to flip the House, cripple Trump's presidency and ensure he's in full lame duck mode during his final two years before the 2028 presidential campaign.\nTrump and his allies are determined to prevent that.\n\u201cAs goes Texas, so goes the nation and we are in a battle, this is not hyperbole, we are in a battle for the future of the republic, for the future of these United States,\u201d Texas state Rep. Brian Harrison, a former first-term Trump administration official, told USA TODAY, adding: \u201cThe stakes could not be higher.\u201d\nLaunching a rare mid-decade redistricting, Texas Republicans have drawn a new map of U.S. House districts that could give the GOP five more seats and help the party maintain control of the narrowly-divided chamber.\nIf they succeed, a pliant GOP-led House would allow Trump to continue one of the most aggressive and disruptive agendas in modern presidential history, while a Democratic majority in January 2027 opens the door to Congressional investigations, legislative paralysis \u2212 even a third impeachment.\nDemocratic control of the House would be the \"de facto\" end of Trump's presidency, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a recent press conference.\nRepublicans argue it would bring chaos, pointing to the impeachments that consumed Washington D.C. during the second half of Trump's first term.\nThe GOP's Texas power play has shaken the political landscape 15 months ahead of the midterm election, setting off a redistricting arms race as blue state leaders move to create more Democratic-leaning House seats to counter Texas, and lawmakers in other red states, including Indiana and Missouri, consider joining the fray.\nThe tit-for-tat redistricting battle has exploded into one of the most consequential elements of the 2026 midterms, with the potential to decide control of the House well before votes are counted.\nDemocrats seek check on Trump\nRepublicans currently hold a 219-212 majority in the House, with four vacancies. The party in power typically loses seats in the midterms. If the four vacant seats are filled by a member of the same party that vacated them, Democrats need to pick up just three seats to win control.\nTrump\u2019s agenda has energized the Democratic base.\nA Democrat-controlled House could kill any legislation coming out of the White House, launch investigations of the Trump administration on everything from the Epstein files to Trump's deportation tactics, wield subpoena power to compel testimony from administration officials and even impeach the president for a third time.\n\"Donald Trump has always been a wannabe dictator,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat, told USA TODAY. \"If Democrats take control of the House we\u2019re a stumbling block for him.\"\nTrump has seen it before.\nDemocrats rode a wave of anti-Trump enthusiasm to win the House in 2018 during his first term and aggressively probed everything from Trump\u2019s tax returns and personal finances to his administration\u2019s family separation policy for detained immigrants and his purported threats to the rule of law.\nTrump twice was impeached by the House during his first term after Democrats won a majority, the first time over allegations he pressured Ukraine's president to dig up dirt on political rival Joe Biden and the second for allegedly inciting an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021 when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.\nThe Senate acquitted Trump in both cases. Democrats face a less favorable political map for the upper chamber and are less likely to win control next year.\n'Impeach, impeach, impeach'\nRepublicans are highlighting the impeachment threat to argue the last two years of Trump\u2019s presidency could be a distraction from issues Americans care about, such as boosting the economy. They hope to give Trump maximum flexibility to continue a controversial agenda that includes mass deportations, overhauling the federal government and new tariffs on foreign goods.\n\"We all know that should we lose the House, which I don\u2019t think we would... that the Democrats would do nothing but impeach, impeach, impeach for two straight years,\" Texas GOP Rep. Troy Nehls, a Trump ally, told USA TODAY.\nDemocrats say Trump is abusing his power and must be reined in. They point to polls showing aspects of his agenda are unpopular. The Texas redistricting plan is a way for Trump to game the system to circumvent a reckoning at the 2026 ballot box, Democrats say.\n\"Let\u2019s be clear why this is happening, this is happening because Donald Trump is trying to avoid accountability,\" Texas Democratic Party Chair Kendall Scudder told USA TODAY.\nWhether a few new GOP-leaning seats in Texas would be enough to swing the election is unclear. Many other factors could come into play, especially the economy, University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato told USA TODAY.\n\"We\u2019re so far away\" from the election, Sabato said. \"Suppose we have a recession or even a significant slowdown in the economy? Then it probably will be... a sizeable Democratic margin, at least in the House.\"\nBut in a close race for the House, any redistricting changes could be decisive.\nHigh stakes\nBoth parties are acting aggressively, portraying the redistricting fight as a battle for the future of the country.\nAs Texas Republicans worked to jam through a new House map, Democrats fled the state to prevent a quorum and stall legislative business. The state\u2019s GOP governor and attorney general responded with legal threats.\nCalifornia Gov. Newsom is pushing a plan to redraw his state\u2019s House districts to counter Texas.\n\"Whatever they are doing will be neutered here in the state of California,\" Newsom said Aug. 4. Trump \"recognizes he\u2019s going to lose in the midterms and we have the opportunity to de facto end the Trump presidency in less than 18 months. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting a stake in the ground.\"\nOther blue state leaders are contemplating redistricting, and more red states are considering joining Texas to create more conservative-leaning seats.\n'Using every day to the hilt'\nTrump said Aug. 5 on CNBC that \"we are entitled to five more seats\" in Texas because of his strong performance in the state.\nScudder, the Texas Democratic chair, said his party must be willing to play hardball.\n\"We are tired of playing by a different set of rules than the ones they play by,\" he said.\nSabato said presidents typically understand they have two years to enact their agenda and then \"they shift into a lower gear.\" Trump seems determined to make his second two years as consequential as the first two.\n\"Whatever the motivation, he is using every day to the hilt, much to the chagrin of Democrats,\" he said.\nWhoever prevails in the redistricting war, Sabato was skeptical that a Democratic-controlled House would be a meaningful check on a MAGA White House.\n\"There\u2019s no obstacle that cannot be removed or cut down to size, especially when you've got a president like Trump,\" he said."

      "text": "See how Texas redistricting maps could gain Trump more Republican seats in the House\nAt least 51 of 67 Texas Democratic lawmakers have fled the state, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered their arrests, and the Legislature has ground to a halt in a partisan dispute that could decide political control of Congress in 2026.\nRepublicans have proposed redrawing congressional districts in a way that could help the GOP gain five more House seats in the midterm election.\nDemocrats left to prevent a quorum, the minimum number of lawmakers needed to legally meet and enact legislation. The arrest warrants apply only within state lines.\nThat political move has spilled over state lines and ignited legislative disputes across the nation. That includes Illinois, New York and California, where governors are threatening to redraw their own maps to add Democratic-majority districts.\nHere's what\u2019s happening in Texas.\nHow Texas districts could change\nHere's a before-and-after look at how Republicans propose to redraw Texas districts. Many changes are to districts democrats won in the 2024 election including those near El Paso, Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas.\nCan't see our graphics? Click here to reload the page.\nRight now there are 219 Republicans and 212 Democrats in the 435-seat U.S. House of Representatives. Trump\u2019s political operatives fear Democratic victories in 2026 could hamper his final two years in office.\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said Democrats would impeach Trump for a third time if they gained the majority in 2026. Trump is the only president to be impeached twice, both times when the Democrats held the majority in the House.\nTrump has said his margin of victory in Texas in 2024 justifies changing the maps, which were introduced by a Texas legislative committee Aug. 2.\nTrump would have won more districts in 2024 with proposed maps\nTexas has 38 seats in the U.S. House, with 25 currently held by Republicans. According to reporting from the The Texas Tribune, the newly proposed maps would have allowed Trump to racked up victories in 30 Texas districts in the 2024 election \u2014 three more than the 27 districts he actually won.\nHere's a closer look at how key districts could change. The first map shows how current districts voted. The second map shows how the proposed new boundaries might perform based on the Texas Tribune analysis.\nHave voting district changes been disputed before?\nTexas Democrats left the state capitol in May 2003 to prevent Republicans from redrawing congressional districts. The lines eventually were redrawn, the Tribune reported.\nWhen do states draw new voting maps?\nBy law, state governments draw new congressional voting districts \u2013 geographic areas in which voters choose their representatives to Congress \u2013 every 10 years.\nThe districts are created using population changes from the Census Bureau, which updates the information every decade.\nSome Democratic governors are pledging to counter Texas by creating maps in large blue states that would offset GOP gains by targeting Republican members of Congress, USA TODAY said.\nContributing: Aysha Bagchi, Savannah Kuchar, Philip M.

      "text": "Gen Z is getting serious about their finances. What's in the way?\nMembers of Generation Z are becoming more financially independent, a likely welcome reprieve for the bank of mom and dad.\nOver the last 12 months, 72% of Gen Z took steps to improve their financial health, and fewer Zers are relying on monetary support from family, according to a new Bank of America survey of 1,069 adults. Between rent and groceries, young Americans aren\u2019t happy with the high cost of living but they\u2019re reacting to it responsibly, according to Holly O\u2019Neill, Bank of America\u2019s president of retail, consumer and preferred banking.\nWhile they may be known for challenging traditional workplace norms and the Gen Z stare, Zoomers are also leading the way in prioritizing income diversification, entrepreneurship, and values-based spending.\n\u201cGen Z is learning adulting is expensive, but the good news is they\u2019re taking it in stride\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThey\u2019re saving more and investing. I think they\u2019re feeling pretty good, given where they are.\u201d\nProgress toward financial independence\nWhile not all 18- to 28-year-olds have left their parents\u2019 payroll, the percentage of Gen Zers who rely on family financial support is now 39%, down from 46% last year.\nTaylor Price, a Gen Z personal finance expert and founder of Priceless Tay, a platform and coaching program teaching young people how to thrive financially, said that decrease doesn\u2019t only reflect Gen Z growing up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about us waking up financially, \"Price told USA TODAY. \u201cToday, getting rich is a decision, not a dream. The tools and education are publicly available with no minimum net worth required.\u201d\nGen Zers who are still financially dependent on family are also receiving less. The survey found 22% receive $1,000 or more per month, down from 32% a year ago, and 54% receive less than $500 monthly compared to 44% last year.\nA separate savings.com report found groceries, cell phone bills, and rent or mortgage payments top the list of costs parents help their adult children cover.\nGen Z's financial green flags\nFinancial wellness may be a team sport for Gen Z.\nOf those surveyed, 66% said they don\u2019t feel pressure from friends to spend beyond their means. The group values transparency, and 42% don\u2019t mind declining an invite and telling friends they can\u2019t afford an activity.\nA majority focused on reducing expenses in the last year, including 41% who cut back on dining out. More than half put money toward savings and 24% paid down debt.\n\u201cThey\u2019re overall inspired to put themselves on a path to financial independence,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cAs you can imagine, when you\u2019re starting out, things are a little more expensive than you thought.\u201d\nAlthough they\u2019re building good habits, a third are still stressed \u2014 52% of whom cite economic instability as a reason why. But that anxiety leads 90% to take action, the survey found. A majority are checking their bank account balance and budgeting. Nearly half are getting ahead on paying bills.\nGen Z's 'treat yourself' mentality\nFor some, money stress isn\u2019t motivating. In fact, about a third of Gen Zers surveyed said they\u2019re likely to avoid thinking about money and treat themselves to a purchase when they\u2019re worried about finances.\nMore than half buy themselves a small \u201ctreat\u201d at least once a week to celebrate an accomplishment or find a silver lining on a bad day. For 59%, those treat-yourself moments lead to overspending.\n\u201cIt\u2019s less about the treat itself and more about the lack of boundaries around it,\u201d Price said. \u201cA $7 matcha isn\u2019t going to ruin your financial future, but daily impulse spending without a plan will.\u201d\nWhat is holding Gen Z back financially\nGen Z lists the high cost of living as a barrier to financial success. Total monthly spending is higher than 35% of Gen Z thought it would be. Specifically, 63% were surprised by the cost of groceries, 47% were caught off guard by rent and utility bills, and 42% were not expecting the high price of dining out.\nGen Z also isn\u2019t making as much money as they would like. Over half said they don\u2019t earn enough to live the life they want and 55% don\u2019t have adequate savings to cover three months of expenses.\nWhile 42% of Gen Z view saving for retirement and 35% see investing as important steps to financial independence, only a quarter contributed to a retirement account in the last year. One in five invested in the stock market, up slightly from recent years.\nThat said, a 2024 Transamerica Institute study found that Gen Z started saving for retirement at the median age of 20. That\u2019s a 15-year head start compared to baby boomers, for whom the median age to begin was 35.\nFinancial tips for Gen Z\nA detailed financial plan can go a long way in relieving money stress.\n\u201cFinancial stress can either paralyze you or push you. The key is finding a balance,\u201d Price told USA TODAY. \u201cFor Gen Z, it\u2019s about building systems that run in the background.\u201d\nThat\u2019s where Price\u2019s \u201cRich Routine\u201d comes in. She recommends automating savings, contributing to investments, and splitting paychecks across fixed bills, flexible spending, and future goals.\nO\u2019Neill recommends the 50/30/20 budgeting method, stacking up emergency cash, and limiting impulse purchases.\n\u201cWhen your money has a plan, you don\u2019t have to think about it 24/7,\u201d Price added.\nWhen expenses feel unmanageable, Price says, income is how people can take back control. She recommends pursuing a side hustle to create some financial breathing room and preparing for a raise, not waiting for one.\n\u201cTrack your wins at work, quantify your impact, and practice negotiating,\u201d she said. \u201cExplore roles or industries with growth potential.
