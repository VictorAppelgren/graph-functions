      "summary": "President Trump claimed that stocks need tariffs, but the market reaction has been largely negative, with equity indices falling and Treasury yields spiking as investors worry about the fiscal impact of potential tariff refunds. A federal appeals court ruled most of Trump's tariffs illegal, prompting Trump to seek a Supreme Court appeal. The ruling has heightened uncertainty for U.S. fiscal policy, driving bond yields higher and weighing on equity sentiment.",
