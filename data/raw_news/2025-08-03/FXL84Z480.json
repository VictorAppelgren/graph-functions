  "title": "Laguna Beach investigates sites for proposed pump track",
  "description": "The Laguna Beach City Council has moved forward with investigating potential sites for a proposed pump track to bring an additional recreational amenity to the community.",
  "content": "Other cities in the process of looking to bring a pump track to their communities include Buena Park, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Irvine and Tustin, according to the Orange County Mountain Bike Assn. A city staff report noted that San Clemente opened one in April.\n\nLaguna Beach is showing interest in bringing an additional recreational amenity to the community in the form of a proposed pump track, a graded and paved contoured track used by mountain bikers and others to hone their skills.\n\nThe Laguna Beach City Council entertained preliminary analysis of several sites for a proposed pump track during its meeting on July 22. City staff suggested in a report that two tracks could be built \u2014 one for beginners and the other for general use.\n\nThe council appeared to favor exploring a pump track at or adjacent to Moulton Meadows Park, which was in line with the recommendation of the city\u2019s recreation committee.\n\n\u201cIt is currently the vacant section of the park past the soccer field,\u201d said Alexis Braun, the city\u2019s acting director of transit and community services. \u201cIt\u2019s adjacent to mountain biking trails and is already being utilized by the community, with multiple access points connecting both Arch Beach Heights and the Top of the World neighborhoods. Bikers have constructed their own jumps in this proposed location already.\u201d\n\nSites such as Aliso Beach Park, the Community and Recreation Center, and Lang Park also came up for consideration. The alternative sites could potentially infringe upon other recreational amenities or city projects, according to city staff.\n\nSan Clemente recently completed the first pump track in Orange County. The 18,000-square-foot facility, which city staff noted cost approximately $619,000, opened in April. The land provided to build that facility was largely flat.\n\nDavid Browning, president of the Orange County Mountain Bike Assn., addressed the topography associated with the Moulton Meadows Park site.\n\n\u201cThat slope would have to be filled, engineered and [a] retaining wall would have to be built because you have to start with a level surface,\u201d Browning said.\n\nOther cities in the process of looking to bring a pump track to their communities include Buena Park, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Irvine and Tustin, the Orange County Mountain Bike Assn. wrote on its website in an announcement following the Laguna Beach discussion.\n\nOrange County Parks is also planning to construct a 9.7-acre bike facility at Craig Regional Park in Fullerton.\n\nCity staff said community outreach efforts included notices mailed to homes within 500 feet of Moulton Meadows Park, a comment form in the city newsletter, and signage installed around the park soliciting input from cyclists and residents a couple weeks prior to the meeting.\n\nThe response was significant, with 193 park users and 127 neighbors providing feedback in that time period. Asked if a pump track is a park amenity they would use, 77.4% of respondents said they would, according to data presented by city staff.\n\nAbout 60% of the survey respondents whose homes would neighbor the project submitted comments in support of it.\n\n\u201cRegarding concerns about park crowding, the proposed project will be on land outside of the current park boundaries,\u201d said Tierney Doran, the city\u2019s recreation supervisor. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to overcrowd the area that\u2019s already being used. To mitigate undesirable behaviors, we can always install fencing and include supervision by park rangers. \u2026Pump tracks are not intended for e-bikes, nor are they allowed on the nearby trails. We expect that the primary users will be accessing the pump track either via the existing network of trails or the adjacent neighborhoods from Top of the World and Arch Beach Heights.\u201d\n\nDoran added that a pump track could also be used by skateboarders and roller skaters.\n\nApart from impacts on the surrounding neighborhood, environmental concerns also entered into the discussion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to undersell the large-scale environmental impacts of putting it in the open space,\u201d said Councilmember Hallie Jones, who has teamed up with Mayor Alex Rounaghi in a working group for the pump track effort. \u201cI want to be really clear about that. I think it\u2019s possible. I think we could find a win-win situation, but I think it\u2019s going to be complicated.\u201d\n\nThe council voted unanimously to direct staff to further investigate a site selection, including the initiation of a feasibility study and site evaluation. The city plans to work with the county to explore land-transfer agreements for a preferred site and to collaborate with the Orange County Mountain Bike Assn. to identify funding opportunities.\n\n\u201cI just think this is the ideal spot,\u201d Rounaghi said of the Moulton Meadows Park site, noting its accessibility in proximity to residences. \u201cI\u2019m open to the idea of exploring whether it\u2019s feasible. We could easily speak to a civil engineer and just get an understanding of what the cost would be associated with the grading to deal with that topography, which is very intense, but I ultimately think that this site is the one that we should move forward with.\u201d",
