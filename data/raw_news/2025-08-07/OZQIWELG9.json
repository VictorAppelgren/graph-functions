  "description": "",
  "content": "Maryland Stadium Authority is selling approximately $261.8 million in bonds for capital improvements at the Oriole Park baseball stadium and related facilities in Baltimore.\n\nThe offering consists of approximately $251.4 million in Series 2025B Taxable Revenue Bonds with maturities ranging from 2027 through 2038. Series 2025C Taxable Revenue Bonds in the amount of approximately $10.4 million will also be offered. These securities mature in 2027, as per the preliminary official statement posted on MuniOS on Wednesday.\n\nPricing on the bonds is slated for Aug. 13, with closing scheduled for Aug. 27.\n\nInterest on the bonds is payable on Dec. 15, 2025 and semi-annually thereafter.\n\nThe bonds are limited obligations of the Maryland Stadium Authority, payable solely from the Trust Estate, which primarily consists of money in the Camden Yards Baseball Sports Facility Supplemental Financing Fund. This fund receives proceeds from the State Lottery Fund.\n\nProceeds will be used to finance capital improvements to Oriole Park at Camden Yards and other sports facilities. The funds will cover design, renovation, development, and construction costs, as well as pay interest accruing through June 15, 2026, and cover issuance costs.\n\nUpgrades to Oriole Park include a new center field videoboard, right field wall display, upper deck and club level LED ribbon boards, and a unified control room. The new center field videoboard will be two and a half times larger than the existing one, making it the 12th largest videoboard among Major League Baseball stadiums. The enhancements are scheduled to begin following the 2025 season and be operational for 2026, according to the Maryland Stadium Authority website.\n\nS&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings have both issued AA ratings on the bonds.",
