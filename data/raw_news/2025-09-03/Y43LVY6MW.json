  "description": "The data from the 2025 Boundless report reflects the 2023\u20132024 academic year and marks a 9.5% increase from the previous year.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nInternational students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy, according to a new report.\n\nThe data, from the 2025 Boundless Immigration report, reflects the 2023\u20132024 academic year and marks a 9.5 percent increase from the previous year.\n\nThe Trump administration has adopted a tougher stance on student visas, with officials stating that they have revoked more than 6,000 student visas since January.\n\nThe State Department links the actions to overstays and alleged criminal conduct. The administration frames the measures as part of efforts to tighten vetting and curb perceived abuses of the student-visa system, including expanded social media screening and a proposed DHS rule to limit the duration of stay for certain visa categories.\n\nOfficials say roughly 4,000 revocations were for alleged lawbreaking, such as assaults, DUIs, and burglary, and a smaller number, reported at about 200 to 300, for alleged \"support for terrorism.\"\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe number of international students in the U.S. reached 1.58 million in 2024, a 5.3 percent increase from 2023, according to the report.\n\nXiao Wang, founder and CEO of Boundless Immigration, told Newsweek that the international student population and its economic contributions are likely to decrease next year due to the current administration's policies. He attributes this to the revocation of thousands of student visas, restrictions on schools like Harvard and their recent graduates' work opportunities, as well as stricter admissions rules.\n\n\"If prospective students aren't clear about if they can enter the country, graduate, or work, they will look elsewhere,\" Wang told Newsweek.\n\nInternational students supported 378,175 jobs across various sectors, including education, retail, and services, according to the report.\n\nInternational students are concentrated in specific states, with California, New York, Texas, Massachusetts, and Florida hosting nearly half the total population. California alone accounted for 14.6 percent of international students in 2024.\n\nMore than 70 percent of international students in the U.S. come from Asia, with India (422,335) and China (329,541) accounting for the largest shares. Combined, students from these two countries made up nearly half (47.5 percent) of all active Student and Exchange Visitor Program records in 2024.\n\n\"The top students from around the world want to come study in the U.S., get instilled with American values, and are encouraged to achieve the American dream,\" Wang said.\n\nA significant portion of international students pursue degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In 2024, 194,554 international students obtained work authorization through the Optional Practical Training program, with 95,384 receiving STEM OPT authorizations, a 54 percent increase from the previous year. Major tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, were among the top employers of these graduates.\n\nInternational students in the U.S. are considered \"nonimmigrants,\" a category that applies to foreign nationals who enter the country temporarily for a defined purpose, such as education. Their study programs fall under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS), which is administered by the Department of Homeland Security. Most are admitted on F-1 visas for academic study, M-1 visas for vocational training, or J-1 visas for exchange programs.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is proposing new four-year limits for holders of student, exchange, and media visas as part of efforts to tighten immigration regulations.\n\nIn a proposal published in the Federal Register on August 27, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) outlined plans to revise the F, J, and I visa categories.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nXiao Wang, founder and CEO of Boundless Immigration, said in a statement: \"Fewer international students will have a ripple effects to the local community around the schools, but more worrisome, will actively suppress the next generation of researchers and entrepreneurs. If students decide to go to Canada, the UK, or Australia instead, we are losing more than in-year revenue, we are losing brainpower and the energy that fuels the next generation of innovation in America.\"\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe Trump administration could continue to take a hard-line stance toward student visa holders as it looks to curb migration and carry out widespread deportations.",

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe Trump administration is proposing new four-year time limits on student, exchange and media visa holders, as part of plans to tighten up immigration rules.\nIn a proposal filed in the Federal Register on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced its intention to modify the F, J, and I visa categories.\n\"If enacted, this rule would create additional uncertainty, intrude on academic decision-making, increase bureaucratic hurdles and risk deterring international students, researchers and scholars from coming to the United States,\" Miriam Feldblum, president and CEO of the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, told Newsweek.\nWhy It Matters\nStudent visa holders have been a focus of immigration enforcement under the second Trump administration, with many having their legal status revoked and interviews for new applicants paused for several weeks. This latest proposal revisits a plan from President Donald Trump's first term.\nWhat To Know\nThe DHS said that, unlike many other visa types, F, J, and I visas currently do not have time limits; instead, they require holders to adhere to the rules of their respective visas. Under the new plan, four-year limits would be imposed, aimed at stopping lengthy visa overstays.\nThe three categories cover foreign students, exchange visitors\u2014such as summer workers, au pairs, and medical students\u2014and those in foreign media.\nThe DHS memo stated that part of the reason for seeking the new limits was due to the \"dramatic rise\" in these visas, with F visas (used by international students) increasing from 260,000 in 1981 to 1.6 million in 2023.\nJ visas (used by some students, academics, medical professionals, au pairs and other such visitors) experienced a 250 percent increase between 1985 and 2023, rising from 141,200 to approximately 500,000, while I visas (for media) also doubled during the same period.\nThe DHS stated that this posed a challenge to its agencies when it came to monitoring individuals in the U.S. with such visa types, and that a fixed-term approach would be more effective in managing immigration numbers.\nFor student visa holders, under the new proposal, they would have to either apply for a change in status at the end of their term (i.e., for an H-1B or other work-based visa) or ask for an extension of their F-1 visa if they have not completed their studies. Similar parameters would apply to I and J visa holders.\nThe Trump administration's efforts to withdraw legal status for students and hold up interviews at the embassy stage have faced and lost to legal challenges in recent months, with student and exchange visitor advocates arguing that these programs deliver significant benefits to the U.S. economy.\nWhat People Are Saying\nMiriam Feldblum, president and CEO of the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, told Newsweek: \"The proposed rule is yet another unnecessary and counterproductive measure targeting international students and scholars. It would require them to repeatedly submit additional applications just to remain in the country and fulfill requirements of their academic programs\u2014imposing significant burdens on students, colleges and universities, and federal agencies alike.\"\nA DHS Spokesperson, in a statement shared with Newsweek: \"For too long, past Administrations have allowed foreign students and other visa holders to remain in the U.S. virtually indefinitely, posing safety risks, costing untold amount of taxpayer dollars, and disadvantaging U.S. citizens. This new proposed rule would end that abuse once and for all by limiting the amount of time certain visa holders are allowed to remain in the U.S., easing the burden on the federal government to properly oversee foreign students and history.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nDHS will now welcome comments and feedback on the proposals. When the idea was floated in 2020, over 32,000 comments were submitted, many of which were against the idea, which was subsequently scrapped by the Biden administration.\nUpdate 8/27/25, 1:45 p.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from Miriam Feldblum.\nAbout the writer\nDan Gooding is a Newsweek reporter based in New York City. His focus is reporting on immigration and border security. ... Read more"

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe loss of foreign students will impact the United States' economy, new data shared with Newsweek on Tuesday revealed.\nWith international students spending an average of $35,000 per year in their local communities, a 10 percent drop in this spending could lead to a $3.4 billion dent in U.S. GDP, data from economic analysis platform Implan found.\n\"This is not a college town problem and it's not an education state problem. It's an effect that is going to ripple through the broader economy,\" Bjorn Markeson, academic divisional director at Implan, told Newsweek.\n\"It's not going to be immediate. It's going to take some time. But it's a sizable amount of economic activity that is associated with international students, and those ripple effects are going to be felt both in communities that have colleges and universities and in the economy as a whole.\"\nNewsweek reached out to the U.S. Department of Commerce for comment via email Tuesday morning.\nWhy It Matters\nThe Trump administration has taken a tougher stance on F-1 student visa holders in recent months, with more than 6,000 revoked since January for a variety of reasons, including alleged immigration law violations. Colleges and internation student advocates have warned that the loss of thousands of temporary immigrants could negatively impact schools and the communities they sit within.\nWhat To Know\nThe data released by Implan looked at the potential monetary impact of losing new students, which may not fully be seen until next school year.\nAcross the country, about 26,800 jobs could be lost, along with $1.8 billion in labor income for every 10 percent drop in spending by foreign students who choose to stay at home or go elsewhere.\nAs Newsweek previously reported, more than 1.5 million foreign students were enrolled in schools across the country in fiscal year 2024, up 5 percent on the previous year. The majority came from China and India, countries whose immigrants are seeing increasing pushback from those on the right concerned about high levels of immigration.\nAmid concerns in college campus protests around the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Trump administration began revoking student visa holders' legal status in the spring. Only a few hundred saw their visas revoked for allegedly being pro-Hamas, with the vast majority picked up on minor offenses, such as traffic violations.\nThe Presidents Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration previously warned that the efforts would deter future international students, leading the U.S. to lose at least $44 billion in economic activity annually.\nImplan's data reflected similar potential losses, finding that four states would likely see the biggest impact of the White House's policies:\n- Texas: 2,500 jobs and $300 million in GDP\n- Massachusetts: 1,800 jobs and $260 million in GDP\n- North Carolina: 600 jobs and $70 million in GDP\n- Wisconsin: 400 jobs and $44 million in GDP\nWhen it comes to the sectors likely to be affected, Implan predicted that every 10 percent drop in student visa holder spending would lead to job losses in these key sectors:\n- Food service workers: 2,800\n- Retail sales: 2,400\n- Office support roles: 2,300\n- Health care support staff: 1,700\n- Material movers: 1,600\nMarkeson told Newsweek that it would take time for all the effects to be felt, depending on how many students decide to return or avoid applying for student visas in the first place.\n\"It'll hit first in retailers, restaurants, local service providers, and then it'll slowly ripple through the economy to warehousing, to transportation, to manufacturers,\" Markeson said. \"That's going to take a little more time because it takes time for those dollars to flow through and for businesses to make those kinds of decisions.\"\nUncertainty was a key word in this, Markeson said, as the shifts in immigration policy happened so rapidly and the new school year arrived already. However, the readily available data on F-1 visa holders did mean that this immigrant group was a helpful indicator of how Trump's policies were playing out more widely.\n\"The broader shifts in policy around immigration are a little harder to wrap your hands around in terms of numbers and spending and locations, but a similar principle is going to follow,\" he said. \"That with a networked economy, the effects, the economic effects may hit specifically in given geographic areas that have high proportions of immigrants living there, but their expenditure patterns ripple through the economy and are going to touch it in a lot of different places much further afield.\"\nWhat People Are Saying\nMiriam Feldblum, president and CEO of the Presidents Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, told Newsweek in June: \"We have close to 400,000 international students participating in some form of training that directly benefits American employers, industry, research across the country.\n\"This is, again, beyond thinking about the $44 billion, but thinking about the actual work, talent, skills that could be lost if we do not ensure that international students want to come here. Our premier destination role is not assured, it is fragile.\"\nA State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital on August 18: \"Every single student visa revoked under the Trump administration has happened because the individual has either broken the law or expressed support for terrorism while in the United States. About 4,000 visas alone have been revoked because these visitors broke the law while visiting our country, including records of assault and DUIs.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nThe Trump administration said it has placed all U.S. visa holders\u2014including students\u2014under continuing review, while there have also been moves to increase vetting at U.S. embassies and consulates when international students apply for the first time. It is yet to be seen what impact these policies will have on student visa arrivals in the coming year.\nAbout the writer\nDan Gooding is a Newsweek reporter based in New York City.

  "argos_summary": "International students contributed $43.8\u202fbillion to the U.S. economy in the 2023\u201124 academic year, a 9.5% rise from the prior year. The Trump administration has revoked more than 6,000 student visas, tightening vetting and raising uncertainty for future enrollment. A 10% decline in student spending could cut U.S. GDP by $3.4\u202fbillion and eliminate roughly 26,800 jobs, especially in retail, food service and support roles. States such as Texas, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Wisconsin would feel the largest impact.
