  "content": "SCARLET: WELCOME TO BLOOMBERG MARKETS, I'M SCARLET FU. TWO CRITICAL INFLATION REPORTS IN THE COMING DAYS. HERE IS WHERE THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW. SEMI CONDUCTOR STOCKS ARE LEADING THE WAY. INTEL'S CEO SET TO MEET THE PRESIDENT AFTER TRUMP CALLED FOR HIS RESIGNATION. AMD AND NVIDIA AGREEING TO PAY 15% OF THEIR REVENUE TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN RETURN FOR EXPORTING CHIPS. THE 10-YEAR GILTS COMING DOWN TO 4.2 5%. GOLD FUTURE SLIDING AS TRADERS STILL AWAIT CLARIFICATION FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ON WHETHER CERTAIN GOLD BARS FACED TARIFFS OR NOT. THAT COST A LOT OF CONFUSION FRIDAY. LET'S QU\u00c9BEC TO EQUITIES TO CHECK OUT INDIVIDUAL MOVERS AND LET'S BRING IN NORA LINDA. > > I'M LOOKING AT A FEW NAMES IN THE RED THIS AFTERNOON LOOKING AT BIOTECH STOCKS. I'M LOOKING AT CAPRICORN THERAPEUTICS. TUMBLING AFTER A FORMER REGULATOR OF GENE THERAPY AND VACCINES WAS FORMALLY OUSTED BUT IS NOW COMING BACK AFTER HE IS RETURNING AT THE FDA REQUEST. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER HE WILL TAKE HIS FORMER ROLES AS CHIEF SCIENCE AND MEDICAL OFFICER HERE BUT WE HAVE SEEN SHARES TUMBLING AS THEY ARE TRYING TO DIGEST THE NEWS. TAKING A LOOK AT SOME OF THE NAMES AND GREEN, SHARES OF CANNABIS STOCKS ARE FLYING HIGH. AFTER A WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORT THAT TRUMP IS CONSIDERING RECLASSIFYING MARIJUANA AS A LESS DANGEROUS DRUG SO YOU ARE SEEING SHARES GETTING A LEFT THIS AFTERNOON BUT I DID WANT TO END ON ANOTHER NAME AND FOCUS HERE. WE ARE LOOKING AT PARAMOUNT SKY DANCE RECENTLY ACQUIRED BY SKY DANCE LAST THURSDAY. IT DID WIN THE RIGHTS TO SHOW ALL EVENTS FROM THE UFC IN THE U.S. FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS, THAT'S A MASSIVE DEAL WORTH $7.7 BILLION. YOU ARE SEEING THE SHARES RISING AFTER THE NEWS. SCARLET: THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR MORE ON THE OVERALL EQUITY MARKET AS WELL AS GLOBAL MARKETS , LET'S BRING IN CATHERINE ROONEY BARRA FROM STONE AND. THE S & P 500 IF IT DOES CLOSE AT THESE LEVELS WOULD CLOSE HAD YET ANOTHER RECORD HIGH. I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR FROM YOU WHEN IT COMES TO THE MARKET CONVERSATION, WE ARE AT THESE LEVELS, BUT THE NARRATIVE IS SHIFTING FROM SOFT LANDING TO STAGFLATION, THIS IDEA THAT RISING INFLATION AND A STAGNATING ECONOMY SEEMS MORE LIKE WHAT MAY BE IN STORE. WHERE ARE WE IN THAT TRANSITION OF THAT NARRATIVE? ARE WE AT THE START OR THE MIDDLE? WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR HOW INVESTORS ALLOCATE? CATHERINE: EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR SOFT LANDING. WE ARE NOW FINALLY AT THAT POINT. AS WELL AS THE LABOR MARKET. ECONOMIC GROWTH BELOW POTENTIAL. THE IMF INCREASED THEIR U.S. GDP REVISIONS. THAT IS RIGHT ON PAR WITH POTENTIAL. WE ARE NOT UPGRADING BELOW POTENTIAL GROWTH. WITH THE LABOR MARKET THAT IS WEAKENING, BUT CERTAINLY NOT AT WHEREVER WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THE NEUTRAL RATE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. MAKING UNEMPLOYMENT INFLATIONARY OR DEFLATIONARY. WE ARE STILL BELOW THAT. THE LABOR MARKET IS STILL NOT IN DIRE STRAITS. I'M NOT AT THE POINT TO CALL IT STAGFLATION THOUGH THAT IS THE ZEITGEIST AT THE MOMENT. I WOULD MAY BE CONFERRED MORE WITH THE IDEA OF SOFT LANDING. THE VALUATION IS STILL SLIGHTLY ABOVE TARGET BUT ECONOMIC GROWTH IS SHOWING CLEAR SIGNS OF DECELERATION. SCARLET: THE DYNAMICS OF THE SOFT LANDING LOOK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT WAS. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE JULY JOBS REPORT. THAT IS COMING UP TOMORROW AND WILL BE CRITICAL IN TERMS OF HOW INVESTORS VIEW THE MARKETS GOING FORWARD. GIVEN THAT THE ECONOMICS STATISTIC SAID WAS FIRED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE HUGE REVISIONS NEEDED IN THE JOBS REPORT, HOW MUCH FAITH DO YOU HAVE IN THE CPI REPORT. > > MY PROPRIETARY FORECAST MODELS ARE BORINGLY ON TARGET WITH BLOOMBERG. WHAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE LOOKING AT IS THE IMPACT ON TARIFFS ON THIS NUMBER, THAT IS WHAT ECONOMISTS WHERE ANTICIPATING INFLATION WOULD BE AFFECTED BY, BY THE BACK END OF THE SUMMER, EARLY AUTUMN. WE SHOULD BE SEEING INFLATION NUMBERS AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM COME INTO PLAY GET. THE NET DRAG OF TARIFFS ON GROWTH AND INFLATION WILL BE LESS WITH THE MARKET ANTICIPATED AT THE BEGINNING. ONE OTHER THINGS IN TERMS OF MARKET ALLOCATION AND STRATEGY, TERM PREMIUM JUMPED SIGNIFICANTLY. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HIS GROWTH, DEMAND, INFLATION, COMBINED THAT WITH TRADE DEALS. THE RUN RATE OF $300 BILLION IN NET REVENUES ON THE BACK OF TARIFFS. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING NOW AS INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS MORE KEEN ON DURATION, GRABBING THE TERM PREMIUM BECAUSE THEY SEE IT IS BETTER SUITED TO REALITY RATHER THAN THE WHOLESALE FEAR POST APRIL 2. SCARLET: I'M LOOKING AT THE FORECAST. LOOKING AT THE CORE AND THE HEADLINE NUMBER EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE. WE HAVE SEEN ESPECIALLY WITH THE JOBS REPORT THAT IT DID RESULT IN A BAD OUTCOME FOR RISK ASSETS. WHAT IS THE DYNAMIC NOW FOR HOW MARKETS REACT TO WEAK VERSUS STRONG DATA? ARE WE BACK TO BAD DATA IS A BAD OUTCOME FOR MARKETS OR BAD DATA IS A GOOD THING FOR MARKETS? KATHRYN: I THINK THANKFULLY WE ARE BACK TO A LESS VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE ARE HANGING ON TO LEAD -- LESS TO EACH HEADLINE. I THINK WE ARE PAST THAT. WE ARE PAST PEAK FEAR AND WE ARE BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE GAUGING THE ECONOMY ON THE FUNDAMENTALS. WHERE IS THE CONSUMER? HOUSING IS STILL COMPLETELY UNAFFORDABLE. I WOULD ARGUE THAT IS PART OF INORDINATE GOVERNMENT ISSUANCE. THE BAD NEWS IS WE COULD SEE ADDITIONAL DELINQUENCIES. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE MY EYE ON AS YOU LOOK AT AUTO LOANS, STUDENT LOANS. ALL OF THESE DELINQUENCIES ARE MOVING HIGHER. I DON'T THINK IT IS SMOOTH SAILING. IT IS BACK TO BEING CHEAP. MARKET COMPLACENCY IS BACK TO THE FORWARD. SCARLET: I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. WE HAVE SEEN GLOBAL MARKETS PERFORM BETTER. YOU HAVE NOTED BRAZIL AND MEXICO ARE SEEING INFLOWS. WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN WE SEE NEWS OF THE COLUMBIA PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL DYING TWO MONTHS AFTER A SHOOTING? HOW DOES THAT CHANGE WILLINGNESS TO INVEST IN EMERGING MARKETS LIKE COLUMBIA. KATHRYN: IT IS MAYBE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL EMERGING MARKETS GOT -- MARKETS, BUT IT IS INDICATIVE OF THE INHERENT RISK IN EMERGING MARKETS. THIS IS A SENATOR WHO WAS IN FACT ASSASSINATED AT THE END OF THE DAY. HE SPENT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AND CRITICAL CARE. WE HAVE SEEN THE INTEREST IN COLOMBIAN DEBT PLUMMETING BECAUSE SECURITY RISKS ARE RISING. ADDING TO THAT ASSASSINATION, THE INDICTMENT AND CONVICTION OF A FORMER PRESIDENT THAT WAS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WILL DECREASE APPETITE FOR COLOMBIAN ASSETS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE WON'T BE INTEREST IN BRAZIL AND MEXICO WHICH OPERATE UNDER A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF DRIVERS. BRAZIL TENDS TO BE A BENEFICIARY OF THE TRADE WAR AND MEXICO IS A LEVERED LAY ON THE U.S.. THERE WAS A LOT OF INTEREST IN THE BIGGER NAMES IN THE EMERGING MARKET SPACE. WHILE TALKING TO HER INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS WHO ARE REAL MONEY, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UNWINDING AND REALIZING WHAT HAS BEEN A SPECTACULAR TRADE, THE EUROPE TRADE YEAR TO DATE. IN FAVOR OF LOADING BACKUP ON THE U.S.. IT HAS CERTAINLY NOT GONE OUT THE WINDOW. SCARLET: THERE ARE SOME HEADLINES WE WANT TO UPDATE YOU ON. HIS MEETING WITH SCOTT BESSENT, THE TREASURY SECRETARY, WAS CANCELED. TRADE ISSUES WITH BRAZIL ARE NOT A FOCAL POINT FOR THE U.S. ACCORDING TO THE FINANCE MINISTER WHO IS AGAIN SPEAKING ON LOCAL TELEVISION. IN TERMS OF MARKET REACTION, LOSING GROUND. THE BRAZILIAN REAL IS WEAKER VERSUS THE DOLLAR. HOW DOES THIS CHANGE OF SOME KIND OF TRADE DEAL IS LONG IN THE COMING? KATHRYN: IF IT IS LONG IN THE COMING AND MARKETS ARE NOT COMING AND I EXPECT THERE TO BE A CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT WITH THE CURRENT PRESIDENT LULA IS VERY UNPOPULAR, WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET A VERY MARKET FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT ELECTION. THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN EVENTUAL TRADE WITH BRAZIL, I THINK WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES IN SOME OF THESE INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATE'S. IT IS BASICALLY AFFECTED BY THE STATE. IT IS RESULTING IN DOWNTURNS LIKE WHAT WE ARE SEEING TODAY. SCARLET: DO YOU WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THE ELECTIONS TAKE PLACE OR IS NOW THE TIME TO JUMP IN WHEN YOU CAN ANTICIPATE THAT LULA WILL LOSE GROUND. KATHRYN: I THINK THESE THINGS ARE GENERALLY PRICED IN CLOSER TO THE ELECTION DATE. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE TRADE CONFLICT. IF YOU AGREE AND YOU THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE AN EVENTUAL TRADE DEAL WHICH IS MY SUSPICION IN THE CASE OF BRAZIL BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT TO LOSE, THE U.S. HAS LOST GROUND TO CHINA BEING THE NUMBER ONE TRADE PARTNER WITH BRAZIL BUT IT REMAINS AN IMPORTANT MARKET FOR BRAZIL, SO I DO THINK THERE WILL BE A TRADE ACCORD. I THINK WE WILL GET A BOOST IN ASSET PRICING BECAUSE OF THIS CHANGE. I THINK IF YOU ARE IN EMERGING MARKET INVESTOR YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BRAZIL, YOU SHOULD IN MEXICO AND HE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES IN ASIA AS WELL. SCARLET: GOOD STUFF. CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT STONE X FINANCIAL, WE COVERED THE U.S., LATIN AMERICA. PRESIDENT TRUMP CONFIRMS NVIDIA WILL PAY 15% OF CHIP SALES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a > > IN OTHER WORDS, TAKE 30%-50% OFF OF IT. THAT IS THE LATEST AND GREATEST IN THE WORLD, NOBODY HAS THAT, THEY WANT TO HAVE IT. IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. IT HAS A MARKET, I SET I WANT 20%. FOR THE COUNTRY. SCARLET: THAT WAS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, CONFIRMING NVIDIA WILL PAY ITS CHIP SALES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AS PART OF A DEAL TO SHARE EXPORT LICENSES WITH THE COUNTRY. YOU HAVE SHARES WAVERING AFTER BOTH AGREED TO PAY 50% OF SALES FROM CHINESE CHIP -- 15% OF SALES FROM CHINESE CHIPS TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO BE REAL SPRING IN CAROLINE HYDE. IS THIS WHAT JENSEN HUANG WAS NEGOTIATING ALL ALONG HE WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CHINA AND THE WHITE HOUSE? CAROLINE: SEEMINGLY IT WAS A DEAL DONE WITH JENSEN HUANG. WE HAD COME AWAY WITH BATTLING TRUMP DOWN. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS QUICK TO CALL OBSOLETE. WE HAVE HEARD FROM DAVID SACHS TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT THESE ARE THOSE STILL MADE FOR THE CHINESE MARKET. SO NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES CHINA MAKE OF IT? WHAT HAS BEEN INTERESTING OVERNIGHT IS CHINESE STATE RELATED PRESS WORRIED ABOUT THE LACK OF EFFICIENCY SO THEY SAY AND THE SECURITY RISKS. JENSEN HUANG WAS BUSY BEING SUMMONED BY THE WHITE HOUSE BUT BUSY BEING SUMMONED BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE TALK COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE RELATIONAL IN MANY WAYS TECH EXECUTIVES AND ADVISORS WHO HAVE BEEN SAYING MAYBE WE CAN TRACK THESE CHIPS AND THE LOCATIONS AND THAT IS GETTING WORRIES ABOUT THE BACKDOORS FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY WILL ALLOW THEIR AI WINNERS TO DEPEND ON H20'S. OR WHETHER THEY WILL BE FAR MORE SELF-SUFFICIENT. SCARLET: NVIDIA DID GET A LOT OF MONEY FROM CHINA FOR CHIP SALES IN GENERAL. IT CONSTITUTED A BIG CHUNK OF ITS REVENUE. SHOULD CHINA CONTINUE TO BUY THESE CHIPS. WASN'T DEEPSEEK BUILT WITH THESE CHIPS? CAROLINE: THAT IS WHAT EVERYONE WAS CONSIDERING. NO ONE UNDERSTOOD HOW DEEPSEEK HAD MANAGED TO LAND THE AMOUNT OF POWER AT SUCH A PRICE. H 20'S HAVE BEEN WHAT CHINA HAS BEEN DEPENDENT ON. THEY DID WANT ACCESS TO IT. THE QUESTION IS HOW WRONG THEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO REMAIN -- DEPENDENT. THIS IS DOVETAILING WITH U.S. WINNING THE SO-CALLED AI RACE. YES YOU WANT TO TRACK AND MAKE SURE WHAT CHINA IS BUYING AND FROM WHOM. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SHORT TIME THAT -- CHINA IS STILL ATTACHED AWARE TECHNOLOGY IN IT IS US THAT REMAINS THE PROWESS AND WORLDWIDE PREVIOUSLY. IF YOU TAKE AWAY ACCESS AND AMD HAS A NICE LITTLE EARNER AS WELL THAT IT WANTS ACCESS FOR, LOOK IF YOU TAKE THAT AWAY WE ARE JUST GOING TO FEED INNOVATION IN CHINA AND MAKE THEM BUILD IT THEMSELVES. ALLOW 85% OF REVENUE TO FLOAT AND IT IS BETTER THAT THE U.S. REMAINS THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN. SCARLET: THE OTHER IS THE CEO OF INTEL, WAS HE SUMMONED TO THE WHITE HOUSE ARE GOING ON HIS OWN? CAROLINE: THIS IS SO IN MANY WAYS DOVETAILING WITH THE AMD AND NVIDIA STORY. THIS IS SEEMINGLY ABOUT CHINA'S CONCERN WITH CHINESE RELATIONSHIPS. SCARLET: EVEN THOUGH HE IS MALAYSIAN. CAROLINE: HE WAS ON THE BOARD OF SMIC, THE CHINESE SEMI CONDUCTOR GIANT. HE HAS RELATIONS, WE ALL KNEW THAT AND THE BOARD KNEW THAT AND THIS ISN'T KNEW THAT HE HAS THESE ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHINA AND IN MANY WAYS THAT IS WHY PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WAS SO POWERFUL IN THE INDUSTRY. HE IS GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY. AND WHY THEY WILL CONTINUE TO FABRICATE THE MOST SOPHISTICATED AI CHIPS THAT THEY CAN. AT THE MOMENT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE PULLING BACK FROM THAT. SCARLET: BECAUSE INTEL TOOK A LOT OF MONEY IN THE CHIPS ACT, THE GOVERNMENT FEELS IT HAS A SAY. THIS IS A PRIVATELY OWNED COMPANY THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO GET APPROVAL FROM THE PRESIDENT. CAROLINE: ANALYSTS SAYING A GUY ON THE BOARD IS THE PRESIDENT. THEY HAVE MANAGED TO BUILD THAT BRIDGE, THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT INTEL HAS BEEN TO ABSENT FOR TOO LONG AND HE SAYS HE NEEDS TO REMOVE SOME OF THE MISINFORMATION. SCARLET: WE WILL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT. CAROLINE HYDE WITH THE LATEST ON THE CHIP INDUSTRY. COMING UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP DEPLOYING THE NATIONAL GUARD TO WASHINGTON, D.C., DECLARING A PUBLIC EMERGENCY. WE WILL GET THE LATEST FROM WASHINGTON NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a SCARLET: ALL RIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCING HE IS TAKING CONTROL OF WASHINGTON'S POLICE DEPARTMENT AS HE LOOKS TO REDUCE CRIME AND HOMELESSNESS IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL. JOINING US NOW IS KATE SULLIVAN. WHAT IS THE IMMEDIATE CATALYST FOR THIS WHEN THE CRIME RATE DATA HAS SUBSIDED FROM THE HIGHS DURING THE PANDEMIC? KATE: IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THERE WAS A DOGE STAFFER ATTACKED LAST WEEK. TRUMP TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE CARJACKINGS TAKING PLACE. THERE WERE TWO 15-YEAR-OLDS INVOLVED IN THIS. I THINK HE WAS PERSONALLY AFFECTED OR PEOPLE TELLING HIM ABOUT THIS, THE FACT THAT IT WAS A DOGE STAFFER. THIS IS SOMETHING TRUMP HAS TALKED ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME. HE HAS HINTED AT POTENTIALLY TAKING OVER AS HE SAYS WASHINGTON DC AS HE REALLY DECRIES THESE CRIME RATES. AS YOU NOTED, FEDERAL OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THAT THE VIOLENT CRIME RATE IS AT A 30 YEAR LOW. THE BACKUP -- THE DATA DOES NOT BACK UP THE DARK AND DIRE PICTURE THE PRESIDENT WAS PAINTING OF CRIME IN D.C. HE IS PUTTING D.C. UNDER FEDERAL CONTROL AND DEPLOYING THE NATIONAL GUARD. YOU WILL SEE A HUGE INFLUX OF FEDERAL AUTHORITIES PATROLLING D.C. SCARLET: I WONDER HOW MUCH IT WOULD LOOK LIKE LOS ANGELES WHERE THE PRESIDENT CALLED IN THE NATIONAL GUARD TO QUELL PROTESTS. PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN OTHER CITIES, PARTICULARLY BLUE CITIES. KATE: ABSOLUTELY. SOMETHING TO WATCH WILL FOR SURE BE WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER CITIES AFTER THIS. YOU MENTIONED THE SITUATION IN LOS ANGELES WAS AN UNUSUAL ONE AND WE ARE NOT USED TO SEEING THE CITIES AND STREETS OF AMERICAN CITIES LOOKING AS MILITARIZED AS THEY WERE. TRUMP HINTED THIS COULD BE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN D.C., SOMETHING HE COULD TAKE TWO OTHER CITIES. IT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE SOMETHING WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH. SCARLET: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I'M SCARLET FU AND THAT DOES IT FOR BLOOMBERG MARKETS.",

  "summary": "The article discusses the news of AMD and NVIDIA agreeing to pay 15% of their REVENUE to the US Government in exchange for exporting AI chips from China. The companies will pay $7.7 billion in return for these chips. The article also discusses the potential for the International Association of Industry Co-operation (IMitability) to be a benchmark in the global economy. Meanwhile, there are concerns about the potential impact of the looming inflation of the US economy and potential for a stagnating economy. The IMF has also increased its U.S. GDP REvisations, and the S & P 500 could close at a record high if the S&P 500 closes at these levels, which would mark a record low for the year.",
