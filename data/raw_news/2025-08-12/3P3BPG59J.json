  "content": "Live from Washington, D.C.. Is balance of power with the Joe Matthew. Lower interest rates may require more than a new Fed chair. Welcome to the Friday edition of Balance of Power, as we focus on persistent questions surrounding President Trump's tariff program now that the regime is in place will be joined this hour by Bloomberg's Tom Auralic, one of the forces behind the new book, The Price of Money. Well, check new research on the tariff impacts with our trading partners with Ernie Tedeschi at the Yale Budget Lab. And as President Trump threatens to federalize the city of Washington, D.C., we'll have analysis from our political panel. Bloomberg Politics contributors Judy Shane Zaino and Rick Davis are with us for the hour. And it all follows a look at Wall Street. Let's start with the Friday trade right now. Charlie Pellet has the numbers at World headquarters in New York. Charlie. Hi. Thank you very much, Joe. Matthew, indeed. Very close to a record on the S & P 500 index, the old closing high, 6389. Right now we're at 63, 84, up by 44 points, gain of 7/10 of 1%. Wall Street ending the need know the week on a positive note. Stocks rising as traders sift through all those corporate results. The Dow up 204 now up by about 5/10 of 1%. NASDAQ also advancing 180 points. The nasdaq composite index at a record up about 8/10 of 1%, ten year, 4.28% with a two year 3.75% gold little changed on the day. Now a 3397 up less than 1/10 of 1%. And West Texas Intermediate crude up 4/10 of 1%, 6413 for a barrel of WTI. Intel CEO Lip Boutin says he's got the full backing of the company's board responding for the first time to President Trump's call for his resignation over alleged conflicts of interest, Intel shares down by 2/10 of 1%. Again, recapping S & P 500 index up now by 43, and that is a gain of 7/10 of 1%. Back we go to washington. I'm charlie peloton. That is a bloomberg business splash. All right, Charlie. We thank you, sir. He'll be back a little bit later on this hour. Charlie Pallett, the voice of Wall Street's and the New York subway every day here on balance of power. Thanks for spending some time with us here on the Early Edition on Bloomberg TV and radio. We always have to balance of power. Late Edition, 5 p.m. Eastern as we wrap up news of the day. And we could have a lot to cover at five. As President Trump spends time today with the leaders, a bit later on this afternoon, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan and a trilateral peace signing deal on the schedule for later on today. We want to start, though, with the president's view of the economy and more specifically, interest rates, constantly beating the drum on potential interest rate cuts, which of course, he's not getting from Jay Powell. This is why he is also beating the drum on a new Fed chair. But as you consider a new book from our friend Tom Horlick and several other Bloomberg journalists will talk about here at Bloomberg Economics, it does call into question the whole idea of simply replacing Jay Powell to bring about lower interest rates against the backdrop of tariffs and so many other crosscurrents in our economy. Tom Ehrlich, Jamie Rush and Stephanie Flanders wrote a book called The Price of Money A Guide to the Past, Present and Future of the Natural Rate of Interest. And I'm glad to say that Tom is with us right now in our Washington, D.C. studios. Congrats on this massive project you just completed. We talk every day, Tom, about interest rates through the eyes of the president of the United States. We try also to look at it through the prism of the greater economy and some of the trends, including the tariff program, that have really upended a lot of assumptions about where we're going. We've also heard many economists tell us that long term interest rates could start rising as a result of what we're seeing here. Give us the big picture on what this president might be learning. Well, great to be here, Joe. Thanks for having me on the show. So let's cast our minds back briefly to the early 2000, to Ben Bernanke and to his famous savings glut hypothesis. So you remember back then the Fed was hiking rates. So short term rates were going up, but Treasury borrowing costs stayed low now. And Bernanke said, you know what? There's a glut of global savings. All of this money coming into the US from China, from Saudi Arabia. And that means the Fed can move the short end, but long term borrowing costs are going to stay low. So the big argument that we make in this book, written by my colleagues at Bloomberg Economics, edited by me, by Jamie Rush, by Stephanie Flanders, is that that savings glut is now gone. And the reality confronting the world and the US is a savings shortage. And what that means is that President Trump could appoint whoever he likes as the next Fed chair. He can appoint Kevin Hassett, and he could appoint Kevin Warsh. He could train an AI algorithm to mimic the decision making of Arthur Burns, the Fed chair in the 1970s, who gifted Nixon rate rate cuts and won him the 1972 election. And that would mean the Fed policy rate went down. But for long term borrowing costs, we think this saving shortage is going to be the dominant driver. We think the new normal for the ten year Treasury is around 4.5%. Wow. Well, I'm sure Scott Bessant is not going to want to hear this today. If we did start to see interest rate cuts maybe 50 basis points in September, for instance, I'm curious what it would mean for the housing market, the direct relationship that we see with mortgage rates, because it does sound like the administration is banking on a loosening in the housing market, helping to offset some of these headwinds that you're talking about. So the next move for the Federal Reserve is very likely to be a rate cut, right? We've just had some really weak jobs data, July coming in weaker than expected, major downward revisions to May and June. We've had the surprise exit of Adriano Kugler from the Fed Board and we heard yesterday that she'll be replaced by the by Stephen Myron, currently the head of the Council of Economic Advisors. I'm sure he'll be voting for a cut and put those pieces together. And it's very likely that the Fed will be cutting rates, perhaps not in September, but certainly before the end of the year. The bigger reality, though, Joe, and the reality that we attempt to address in our new book is that for the economy as a whole, it's not the Fed's policy rate that is the most important thing, right? It's the ten year Treasury which sets borrowing costs across the economy as a whole. And for that, we think this this saving shortage is going to be the dominant factor. We think that means that even if. Gets a loyalist in as Fed chair, even if he gets the Fed policy rate down. Yeah, long term borrowing costs are going to stay high. And to come back to your question, that's going to be challenging for real estate. Sounds like challenging for stocks. I talked to Stephen Myron yesterday. Incidentally, he was about an hour before the president announced that he would be his nominee to fill this seat being vacated today, I believe, by a governor cooler that you mentioned. And we were talking about the inflationary or not impacts of tariffs. This administration argues every day that a one time change in prices does not equal inflation. And as he described, they prove this in the first term. Listen to what Stephen Myron said, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors here on Bloomberg. You're right. There's been a lot of conversation about this subject, and I think a few things are worth mentioning. One. We ran this experiment in 2018, 2019. We saw zero macro economically significant evidence of tariff driven inflation. Then, too, we've been running higher tariffs in this administration since the very first day since January 20th. We've now got several months of data and again, there's just zero macro economically significant evidence of price pressures from tariffs. Three, the overall policy mix is extremely disinflationary. This is the new addition, assuming he gets confirmed to the Federal Reserve Board. What's the like take on what he just said? Well, firstly, Joe, I think the logical conclusion from Myron appearing on your show and then getting the nod for the Fed board is that the White House personnel office are watching the show and making their decisions based on in the West Wing every day. Be careful what you say. So I should say, just for clarity, I'm flattered that you would think of me, but I think Chair Powell is doing a great job, and I'm very happy. A Bloomberg Economic well done. So more seriously. And coming back to your question. So I think what we heard there from from Steve Stephen, Myron was a very clear view that tariffs are not going to be inflationary. And the view in the Fed, of course, is, well, probably they are going to be inflationary. So Fed staff, many on the Fed board are nervous about cutting interest rates because they think, well, we haven't seen the tariff impact just yet, but maybe that's because everyone front run the tariffs stocked up on inventory. Maybe the tariff impact on inflation is still to come. We have to stay cautious. We have to stay cautious. What we heard from Stephen, Myron, is, well, I don't accept that view. I don't think tariffs are going to be causing inflation. And implicit in that is the idea that actually the Fed just can get on with it and start cutting now. And so I think what that tells us is that Myron's appointment sets up some interesting conversations, probably some dissents and some conflict on the Fed board. Congrats on this book, The Price of Money A Guide to the Past Present Future of an Actual Rate of Interest. Tom Erlich, Bloomberg Economics. Great to have you as always, Tom. Don't be a stranger working with us here in Washington. There you have it on Bloomberg TV and radio. We want to add the voice of Ernie Tedeschi as we consider the anecdotal evidence out here that is frequently competing with the hard data. You hear that exposed on a regular basis here on Bloomberg and questions about, as Tom just suggested, whether that hard data will catch up or vice versa to the anecdotal evidence, look no further today than when these the most recent fast food chain to, in this case cut its sales guidance or disappoint investors, as McDonald's did earlier this week, as consumers tighten their belts. Breakfast is the point of weakness, which in itself is considered an economic indicator. When people stop working, they don't buy breakfast on the way to the office because there's no office to go to. Also, it's the first year, skip, when you're trying to save a couple of bucks. Sweetgreen joins the parade down today on fewer diners splurging on pricey salads. Because guess what? You go to Sweetgreen when you get a lunch break at work. You add what we heard from Proctor and Gamble, raising prices on a quarter of its consumer products in its quarterly report. The likes of Black and Decker feeling the weight of tariffs. And we're starting to wonder exactly what all of this means. I talked last evening with a grocer. Stew Leonard Junior joined us on the Late edition of Balance of Power to talk about the costs that he's encountering at his grocery store. And he said he's not going to be able to afford it for that much longer. The margins just aren't big enough. Let's hear from Stu Leonard. He was standing right in the produce section when we talk to him. Right now, what we're just trying to do is navigate. We're eating a little bit of the margin and we're already on thin margins in the supermarket business. So we're eating some of it. I can't eat it forever. We're hanging by your fingernails right now. I mean, we can't do this forever. And I'm hoping all of Trump's bear appeals and. We think will work themselves out. And I'm hoping we'll go into the holidays with, like Trump said, low prices. I got to go meet Stu for a ribeye later this month. Ernie Tedeschi is director of economics at Yale Budget Lab and former chief economists at the White House Council of Economic Advisors. He's with us right now on Bloomberg TV and Radio. Ernie, it's great to have you. Do you see? Poor stew is hanging by his fingernails there. He even showed us his fingernails. How long can he hang on? I'm hanging on by my fingernails trying to keep up with these tariff updates, although I'm not in the dire straits that's due, as you know. Look, I think that what we see from the data, first of all, is we see very clear signs that tariffs are having a price level impact on affected goods. So let's take durable goods, for example, durable goods, durable goods in the PCI report, which is the inflation concept, but the Fed pays attention to. Usually durable goods fall in price over the years through over the first six months of last year, durable goods fell in price by 0.6%. They've risen by 1.7% in the first six months of 2025, which is very unusual heat for durable goods. Those are the goods, of course, like appliances, furniture, electronics that are the most sensitive to the tariffs that have been put in place by this administration. So I think there are very clear signs that certain goods in particular are getting hit by these tariffs and that the price and that the effect of the tariffs is being passed on to consumers. We estimate at the budget lab and a forthcoming report that probably about three quarters of the tariffs that have been put in place so far are being borne by consumers rather than businesses and rather than foreign producers. I got some pretty chippy mail from folks on the terminal and viewers and listeners. After that conversation with Steve and Myron yesterday, people start pulling their hair out over this argument about whether tariffs are inflationary. The whole other argument is about, well, who actually pays tariffs? Can you speak to this issue? The idea of a 1 to 1 time bump in prices not equaling an inflationary trend? What's what's your view of this? Yeah, no, it's a very important debate to have. So let's be absolutely clear. The question is the effect of tariffs on the price level. Like I said, there is very clear, I think, evidence right now that tariffs are raising the price level. The much more debatable contention is whether tariffs increase inflation growth in prices persistently over time. Now, tariffs take some time to phase in and to be, you know, priced into businesses, businesses, you know, sort of look, they look over their shoulder, they look at what other businesses are doing. They look at how price sensitive consumers are. And they make decisions from week to week, month to month, how much they're going to pass on to consumers. Gradually, over time, we think more and more of the tariff gets passed on to consumers. And and because of that gradual phasing, it can feel inflationary, right? Like the, you know, the pace of growth in prices, you know, goes up for a time. The better argument, I think, comes from the Federal Reserve that has looked into this and they say, look, it's not just a mechanical one time price level effect. There are effects on supply chains, the supply side of the economy, and that has a risk of being, if not permanently inflationary, then, you know, persistently inflationary over 2 to 3 years. I think that that is why Jay Powell and the board is worried about is that latter part. I think they totally understand the, you know, the mechanical concept of a one time price level increase. I think what they're worried about is, you know, the spill over into supply chains. I think they're also worried about inflation expectations as well. And we see very clear evidence of higher expectations. You know, in consumer surveys, for example, like University of Michigan. That's got to be the smartest answer I've heard to that question. Yeah, well, thank you. I send it to you, so let's not even get the usual research yet. Well, yeah, this could only get better. Apparently. So the current tariff rate, based on your research at Yale Budget Lab, an overall average effective tariff rate of 18.6%. A lot of people are throwing 15 around. It's higher than 18, the highest since 1933. Overall price level and distributional effects. This is awfully important for all 2025 tariffs rising by 1.8% in the short run. This gets to what Ernie was just saying the equivalent of an average per household income loss of $2,400 in 2025. To your point, these may not be permanent, but they can be persistent. Is this what family should brace for the next couple of years? That's right. So we think that these effects phase in over 2 to 3 years. The other thing I would say, too, is that it won't surprise people to hear that not all families and not all products are affected equally, you know, over those 2 to 3 years. So first of all, it's lower income families that are going to get the bigger hit. When you look at the tariff hit as a share of income, lower income families are hit three times as much as higher income families. And that's because it's not just that lower income families spend a greater share of their income in general. It's that they spend a greater share of their budget on imports, in particular imports from China, because imports are often a cheaper way to get the durable goods necessities that they need. Think about, you know, back to school shopping with clothing and electronics. So so that's point one. The other thing is that, you know, when you look at different products, it's obviously not a 1.8% across the board price increase. You know, services are going to be relatively unaffected by tariffs, whereas when you look at apparel, electronics, cars, you know, you're going to see double digit price increases to the level over a couple of years. Yeah. Even gold is going up. This is a great conversation and one that I'm glad we could have with Ernie Tedeschi. Thank you, as always. Yale Budget Lab, former chief economist, White House Council of Economic Advisors. Data driven research here on Bloomberg. That's what we promise. We'll assemble our political panel next. Rick and Genea on the weigh in on Bloomberg as we follow the Friday trade here, even as we follow the news here in the capital city, which is in itself in the news, maybe you're coming down for a little vacation. Visit the Smithsonian. Tour of the monuments this summer. If you do, you will likely see a lot more police than you may have otherwise. And when I say that, I mean federal police alongside D.C. metro cops. The president of the United States is making this request and it's already happening. This deployment was ordered today at 12:01 a.m., including law enforcement officers from a wide swath of agencies across the federal government, immigration police tasked with deportations. We've got the FBI here, U.S. Marshals, DEA, and as The Washington Post reports, 12 other federal agencies. That's a lot of police cruisers. And they say that this will be very noticeable in the high traffic tourist areas. So, as I say, if you're coming to the Smithsonian, if you're crossing the mall, if you're anywhere around us here at Bloomberg, you're probably going to notice the difference. And this is something the president has talked about before. He has described our capital city as being filthy and dirty and violence and crime ridden. And he has threatened to federalize the city as a result, most recently prompted by the assault of a Dodge worker that led to the arrests of a couple of teenagers here. This individual, Edward Cora Stein, who was one of Elon Musk's top lieutenants at the Doge, known affectionately online as Big balls, was beaten badly after he tried to help a woman who was being carjacked, according to what the president said. Here's Donald Trump from earlier. By the way, I have to say that somebody from Doge was very badly hurt last night. You saw that a young man who was beat up by a bunch of thugs in D.C. and either they're going to straighten their act out in the terms of government and in terms of protection, or we're going to have to federalize and run it the way it's supposed to be run. Let's assemble our political panel. They both know a lot about Washington, D.C.. And I'll preface this by telling you that it is actually a city that we don't only live and work in, but a place that we love. Rick Davis, Bloomberg politics contributor, Republican strategist and partner at Stone Fort Capital, alongside Jenny Shannon, a Bloomberg Politics contributor, senior democracy fellow with the Center for the Study of the Presidency in Congress. Rick, there's always something wrong with a city and you can always, I guess, clean a city more and make it safer. But the fact is, when we look at D.C. crime statistics for this year, 2025, we find that all crime is actually down. The president said it was way up. It's down 7% from the year earlier. Violent crime is down 26%. And assault with a weapon is down 20%. Do we need to federalize Washington, D.C.? Well, the city can always be safer. And the one I live in should be the safest. So I'm for safety. And and we lived here a long time. And the city has gone through various levels of crime, sometimes being the nation's murder capital and sometimes not. And I think it's great that we're experiencing a downturn in crime, but you can never be diligent enough. And I don't begrudge a president for a show of force. There have been some very high profile murders and robberies and assaults recently that have made front page news and most newspapers around the country. And that's no way for our nation's capital to look to the rest of the world, into the rest of our country. So it'll be interesting to see how long this lasts or where it ultimately goes. I can't imagine a scenario where the federal government wants to run a city where they're good at a lot of things, but city management may or may not be a skill set. And so if this is a show of force to reduce crime, I'm for it. If it's something beyond that, you really want to think about it. Well, we have come a long way, obviously, since the 1980s, when a lot of people did refer to the city as the murder capital of the world. To your point, Rick. Back in the days of Mayor Marion Barry going all the way up through COVID and some of the problems that Washington had, keeping things safe and keeping things clean. At this point, though, we've had a massive amount of money invested in this town. We've seen people come from all over the world to create a very diverse community who lives here side by side with people who grew up in Washington, D.C. All of that said, Gini, we should separate these two concepts. Okay. Make the city safer with the help of federal law enforcement as opposed to federalizing the city and having the federal government run Washington, D.C.. Which do you want to see? I want to thank the president for not using that young man's nickname when he spoke about him. That was very grateful for that. And it was horrific what happened to that young man, just 19 years old. That said, the commitment to federalizing D.C. is a long standing commitment by Donald Trump and the GOP overall. The Republican Party's platform in 2024 had this in it. It has long been discussed by Donald Trump. And so what we seem to be seeing, given the crime numbers that you talked about, rightly so, is that he is using this in order to pursue an agenda that he has long been pursuing, which is to criticize cities run by Democrats, to say they are violent and to threaten to take them over. And so, yes, I agree with Rick. I think every thinking person does Everyone wants any community to be safer. But since when does the Republican Party believe that they are better off putting the federal government in to do something at the ground rather than leaving it to the state and the well, in this case, the local community. And so I think there is a bit of hypocrisy there. We've also seen, by the way, just this session in Congress, we saw a senator and a representative introduced legislation to repeal the home rule, which is another thing Donald Trump wants to do. So it's a long standing commitment of Donald Trump's and it seemed to be triggered by this horrific violence we saw the other day. But the numbers don't support it. A lot of people who don't live here may not realize this whole idea of home rule is actually a relatively recent one for the people of Washington, D.C., and remains a controversial one. Do you see people driving around with the license plate? It says taxation without representation. I remember when Tony Williams put that into effect. Home rule was passed in 1973. Rick, if the president really wanted to federalize the city, it would take an act of Congress to overturn the Home Rule Act. We can't even write a budget around here. Could that happen? Well, on a straight line party vote, yeah, you probably could, although I think you'd find a lot of Republicans echoing what Jeannie just said, which is what in the world are we going to do running a city? You know, I thought we were for, you know, the federal government getting out of the nitty gritty of of our community. So I think there's an ideological issue there. But there is a political issue, too. And I think this is one of the things that Donald Trump is sort of giving us a head fake on. We talked a lot in the height of the presidential campaign about what a poor job the Democrats have done in these cities to manage these the the rhetoric around crime and and why it should be an issue that Democrats own. And yet they virtually abdicated it to the Republicans. And and if there are issues that you want to go to to try and get some of these suburban congressional districts to flip from Democrat to Republican, you're going to go to the crime playbook. Law and order is a tried and true political device that Donald Trump has used in the past and I believe is starting to, you know, head fake toward his way to doing that again for the 2026 election. There are some other changes coming to the city that don't involve law enforcement. Genie, a statue of the Confederate general, Albert Pike, is apparently making its return to a location near Judiciary Square. And that is that's right, downtown. If you're a tourist, you walk right by it. Near Pennsylvania Avenue, the National Park Service announced that just this week, remembering it was torn down by protesters in 2020. Also, a large Confederate memorial is being put back in Arlington National Cemetery. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, made this announcement today, having been removed in 2023 as part of a congressional attempt to remove Confederate imagery from military sites. What will this mean for the culture in Washington? Anything? You know, I think what we're seeing is, quite frankly, Donald Trump focusing on law and order, as Rick just talked about, and revitalizing these cultural issues that have worked and for the Republican Party to get their base out. And I think he is doing that in the wake of some really troubling jobs numbers that he obviously was very concerned about the tariff war and uncertain economic issues. He is trying to refocus attention as he thinks forward to the midterm on these law and order and culture issues. And so I think we're going to see more and more of this, not just in D.C. And you gave so many good examples of that, Joe, but I think around the country to remind people of an issue that worked well for the Republicans in 2020 and has for a long time about the far left, which we're talking about, the MAGA. But you look at the far left wing of the Democratic Party and some of the ways in which they've gone to extremes on culture issues. So I think that's what we're seeing here and I think it's going to be important for people in DC for whom some of these issues remind them of the reality that they don't have the ability to have full autonomy in terms of their governance and representation in the federal government. And that's always been troubling for them. The President had called for the return of federal monuments that had been, quote, inappropriately removes unquote, from Washington, D.C. The city's congressional delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton. Rick, is going to be reintroducing a bill to ensure that the statue is permanently removed. We've only got about a minute left. Do we just see this kind of back and forth over these cultural symbols for the rest of this president's term? Yeah, this is just another flare up of the sort of woke attacks that that have been going on for some time. First of all, you should never tear down statues. You go through a process, you know, this got out of control and and now the pendulum swings back the other way. Military bases are being renamed after being changed, you know, and these statues are going up. So it's the breathing in and out of power. And in this case, Alcoa's woke incomes, you know, the Trump administration. I guess that's it, Rick. Thank you. Rick Davis and Julie Shane Zaino, always a fascinating conversation. They'll be back on the Late edition of Balance of Power, which of course starts at 5 p.m. Eastern. Thank you both. Much more ahead as we explore what could come next with Ukraine and Russia and important conversation with former Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, only here on Bloomberg. Thanks for joining us here on Bloomberg TV and radio. Always a pleasure to meet you at the threshold of the weekend. It does feel like it a bit in Washington where things are kind of quiet. But soon we'll have some activity at the White House as the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan join President Trump today for a series of events that will walk us through the afternoon, culminating with a trilateral signing of a peace agreement. That is the way the president will be wrapping his week with big news on Russia and Ukraine. This will likely dominate our conversations next week, and it's already played a pretty big role in this one, even as reciprocal tariffs took effect along with so many other things. This is the day, by the way, that secondary tariffs were intended to take effect, according to the president of the United States. Secondary tariffs against nations buying oil from Russia. But Bloomberg has been doing some remarkable reporting here. According to people familiar with the matter, Washington and Moscow are now aiming to reach a deal to halt the war. And they're even using the word truce here toward an agreement on territories for the planned summit that we expect in the days ahead between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. They say this could happen as early as next week. This is very unclear right now in terms of timing and venue. But the spirit of this deal might be a nonstarter for Vladimir Zelensky. As it would demand Ukraine cede its entire eastern Donbass region as well as Crimea. And essentially freeze in place the lines that have been the subject of this war of attrition for so long. It's where we start our conversation with Wendy Sherman. Always a delight to have the former deputy secretary of state and the Biden administration, now joint senior fellow with the Belfer Center Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University. Wendy, it's great to have you back on Bloomberg TV and radio when you consider this potential deal as the way I just described it, freezing the lines in place. Is that something that Ukraine will accept? Well, I think, first of all, congratulations to Bloomberg on gathering such important information, if indeed these are the outlines of a possible at least stopping the tremendous bombardment of Ukraine with so many lives lost. I think we all would welcome a ceasefire. But it's not only about territory which will be suspect. It's how do you guarantee enforcement of those lines? How do you make sure that Russia doesn't go further? Does Russia also require that the Ukraine not join the European Union, not join NATO's that in the past Putin has said that Ukraine must demilitarize? I can't imagine Zelensky doing that. And although Ukrainian people are war weary for very good reason and really wish this horrible war would be over this horrific illegal invasion, it does remain to be seen not only whether Zelensky will accept this and Ukraine as a whole, but whether Europe, which will have to enforce this future and NATO's will accept it. You wonder what kind of message we're sending here, realizing that parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk have been under Russian occupation since 2014 illegally, and Putin declared the four Ukrainian regions to be forever part of Russia when he announced the annexation back in 2022. Even though he's never actually controlled these territories. So this deal would codify this arrangement, and you tell me it would not tell other nations to try to do the same. Yes, I think this would be a terrible outcome, as you say, not only for Ukraine, but it would also say that other leaders can take territory, perhaps Xi Jinping take Taiwan with impunity, that others around the world could take territory with impunity, that sovereignty, territorial integrity, the right of countries to make their own choices would go by the wayside. So I think there's a lot of detail here. It's one thing to say to get a cease fire, to stop the bombardment. Things freeze in place, but then to get a final peace agreement. I cannot imagine Ukraine deciding that it's going to forever give up this territory and say that it belongs to Russia. We have never said that Crimea belongs to Russia, that they, in fact, legally own Crimea. I can't imagine we will do this for the Donbas either. I think it's important to Joe for your listeners to understand that all of this, of course, we want peace to break out around the world. But President Trump has said he could deal with this on day one. He said he could solve the Middle East on day one. And we have a real crisis of of starvation in Gaza and a prime minister who now wants to go all in and taking Gaza City, putting the hostages at risk. We have yes, this meeting at the White House today between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I understand that it may mean that a transit route will get named after President Trump. Everybody knows how to flatter him to try to get what they want, but it won't, in essence, really resolve Nagorno-Karabakh, which is at the heart of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It also will not be something that Russia much likes. And then, of course, we've got these tariffs that are supposed to come in secondary tariffs on India at the end of this month. That's all leverage in getting to an agreement on Ukraine. So the president has thrown a lot at all of us. And I think some of this is to make sure that we don't keep talking about that really nasty problem he's got in front of him, called the release of the Epstein Files. Wow. You just married a whole bunch of stories there, Wendy. I hadn't heard about this. This trade route named for Trump. This is fascinating. As I read here, the agreement between the two nations would create the Trump route for international peace and prosperity. So that's that's how it's done. I'm going to ask about what's happening in the Middle East in just a moment, but I want to just get your take as as a as a professional diplomat on this back and forth over who should be in the meeting. At one point, President Trump said that Zelensky and Putin must first meet. Then he said maybe the three of them would meet together. And now he has walked that back to suggest that he's willing to meet with Putin alone. Having said that, quote, I don't like long waits. They would like to meet with me and I will do whatever I can to stop the killing, unquote. If Zelensky is not in the room, what good is this? Well, it certainly won't get us to a peace agreement, that's for sure. And, you know, the president is a very transactional negotiator. But what I find very interesting is he often gives up leverage in advance, trying to incentivize people to come to the table. He's doing that with Putin. Putin very much wants this meeting so he can look like he's in charge. He's defining what will happen here. I think Zelensky felt he'd gotten further with the president when they met on the margins of the pope's funeral. But my guess is right now he's in a pretty nervous place. And the president spoke to the leaders of Europe with Zelensky on the phone to talk about what might be happening here. But details are never Trump's strong suit. Most of these tariff deals, as you all know better than I do, are really quite broad decisions without all of the details really being inked, without any of us really knowing what's going to happen over the long term. We've seen that. In the dust up with Japan. I'm sure we will see that with others as well. I'll be deeply curious to hear if President Trump weighs in on Israel's decision to occupy Gaza City. He does have, as I mentioned, some public opportunities here to speak today, but it's important. Israel's Security Council approving a plan to occupy militarily occupy Gaza City as opposed to all of the Gaza Strip. Is it possible to defeat Hamas, as Israel is suggesting, without endangering the hostages that are the whole point of this conflict? Sadly, Joe, I don't think so. The IDF, in fact, said during this ten hour overnight discussion in the Israeli security cabinet that they could not say that the hostages would remain alive. They also said there would be many more deaths of IDF as well as civilians. Nonetheless, the security cabinet decided to go ahead. This has been roundly condemned all over the world. And quite extraordinarily, the chancellor of Germany has said that no military weapons will go to Israel that might be used in Gaza as a result of this decision. I haven't found anyone yet who supports what the prime minister is doing except for his very, very right wing coalition partners who want to see Israel take over pretty much everything, including the West Bank. We're showing some pretty horrifying images of Palestinians who are starving, trying to access food. And part of this plan would include the IDF providing humanitarian aid to civilians outside of combat zones as they enter Gaza City. It is unclear what these combat zones will be, though, and the the camps that will be created in other areas to house refugees. When do you know how complicated this type of planning can be? I'm just curious, drawing on your experience in the Biden administration and President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, ever envision this going on for so long? This is just been horrifying, as I believe even President Trump has reportedly said to Prime Minister Netanyahu in a phone conversation. Don't tell me it's fake. This is Donald Trump saying this is not fake news. You can just look at the pictures and see that they're starving people. Far more people died of starvation today, including two children. The IDF has said it will take until, I think, at least October to get everybody out of Gaza City and find places for them to go. There's no housing in any of Gaza except some remaining in Gaza City. So where people live is not known. You cannot feed this many people with one aid station. You have to have many aid stations so that you don't have people dying as they get stampeded trying to find food. It is a tragedy that USAID is gone. USAID knew how to do this. We have the expertise. We've done it all over the world. We know how to set up these humanitarian corridors and aid stations. The current foundation that's doing this really doesn't know how to do this. And there were months when Israel would not allow in any food. So we are in a very terrible place. And with this new effort to take over Gaza City, things are even worse. Well, you know, I was just going to say that the World Food Program knows how to do this to Cindy McCain, knows how to do this. But they've told us that they won't be allowed in. So will this occupation change that? I don't see how I and the Prime Minister has sort of pulled back a little bit today, not saying they're going to occupy Gaza, because if they occupy Gaza legally, then they are responsible to making sure that everybody is fed and housed. So they are saying that they are going to really just get rid of Hamas, demilitarize Gaza, get Arab states to come in and take care of Gaza. But as others have said, I cannot imagine Arab states coming in behind the guns of Israel to take care of Palestinians. And Saudi Arabia, among other countries, has denounced this plan today. Wendy, I'm really glad you could join us in bringing your experience to our conversation here on balance of power. Wendy Sherman is former deputy secretary of state in the Biden administration, now joint senior fellow at the Belfer Center and Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University. Thank you, Wendy. Come back and see us again soon. I'll meet you back here on the Late edition of Balance of Power. That takes place 5 p.m. Eastern time. We'll have a lot more to talk about following the peace signing that's taking place, Armenia, Azerbaijan at the White House. This is Bloomberg.",
