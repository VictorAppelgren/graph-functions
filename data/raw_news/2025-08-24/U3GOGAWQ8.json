  "title": "Should You Be Adding Allreal Holding (VTX:ALLN) To Your Watchlist Today?",
  "description": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks...",
  "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Allreal Holding (VTX:ALLN). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, Allreal Holding has grown EPS by 19% per year, compound, in the last three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that Allreal Holding's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. EBIT margins for Allreal Holding remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 6.8% to CHF428m. That's progress.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\n\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Allreal Holding's forecast profits?\n\nAre Allreal Holding Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nIt's a necessity that company leaders act in the best interest of shareholders and so insider investment always comes as a reassurance to the market. So it is good to see that Allreal Holding insiders have a significant amount of capital invested in the stock. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth CHF466m. That equates to 16% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors.",

  "argos_summary": "Allreal Holding AG, a Swiss real\u2011estate company, has shown strong recent profitability with a 19% annual EPS growth and a high net margin of 61%, but its revenue and earnings are forecast to decline in the next three years, with a projected 14.3% annual earnings drop and 16.8% revenue decline. The company has a high debt\u2011to\u2011equity ratio of 104.6% and insiders hold a significant 16% stake, indicating alignment with shareholders. While the stock has delivered a 68% return on investment and offers a CHF7.00 dividend, analysts remain bearish due to strained balance sheet and rising debt concerns, leading to a mixed outlook for investors.",
