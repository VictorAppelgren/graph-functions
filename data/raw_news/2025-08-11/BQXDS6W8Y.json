Ben Platt, the Tony, Grammy and Emmy Award-winning actor and singer, recently performed an emotional cover of Addison Rae\u2019s \u2018Diet Pepsi\u2019 at the 2025 Las Culturistas Culture Awards and the internet quickly decided it had serious 'Glee' vibes.\n\nThe awards show, taped July 17 at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles and aired August 5 on Bravo (and streaming on Peacock now), is known for its comedic tone and quirky categories. Hosted by 'Las Culturistas' podcast creators Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers, the event typically offers more laughs than tear-jerking ballads. But when Platt took the stage, he turned a playful pop song into a moving performance that instantly went viral.\n\n\ud83c\udfac SIGN UP for Parade's Daily newsletter to get the latest pop culture news & celebrity interviews delivered right to your inbox \ud83c\udfac\n\nThe Performance That Sparked a Wave of Nostalgia\n\nPlatt\u2019s stripped-down rendition slowed the tempo and leaned into raw vocal emotion, transforming Rae\u2019s upbeat single into something that felt straight out of a 'Glee' episode. Fans flooded social media with praise, not just for his vocals but for the way the cover transported them back to the golden age of the musical comedy-drama.\n\n\"This feels like something Mr. Schue would have made the kids sing for sectionals,\" one fan joked on X (formerly Twitter). Others went further, declaring, \"This is proof we need a 'Glee' reboot.\"\n\nThe demand for a streaming release of Platt\u2019s version was immediate and successful. Within days, \u2018Diet Pepsi\u2019 (Ben Platt's version) was available on major music platforms, ensuring fans could keep replaying it to their heart\u2019s content.\n\n'Glee,' created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan, premiered on Fox in 2009 and quickly became a pop culture phenomenon. The show followed the members of a high school glee club as they navigated relationships, competition and personal challenges, all while breaking into song. Over its six-season run, the series featured more than 729 musical performances, covering everything from chart-topping pop hits to Broadway classics.\n\nThe combination of heartfelt storytelling, diverse characters and cleverly arranged covers made 'Glee' a hit with viewers and an influential force in shaping the modern TV musical format.\n\nAfter the death of cast member Cory Monteith in 2013, Murphy announced the sixth season would be the last. The show concluded in 2015 with over 100 episodes under its belt, leaving fans with a mix of closure and longing for more.\n\nIn an era where reboots and revivals are everywhere, it\u2019s no surprise that Platt\u2019s performance has reignited interest in bringing 'Glee' back. His emotional delivery and the stripped-back arrangement reminded fans of the series\u2019 signature blend of drama and music.\n\nSocial media comments range from playful casting suggestions (\"Ben Platt as the new choir director?\") to more heartfelt appeals for a revival that could bring the same uplifting, inclusive spirit to a new generation.\n\nWhether or not a reboot ever happens, the response to Platt\u2019s \u2018Diet Pepsi\u2019 cover is a reminder of the cultural impact 'Glee' had. It also highlights the enduring power of a well-executed cover to move people\u2014and, in some cases, inspire them to imagine a whole TV series built around that feeling again.\n\nFor now, fans will have to settle for streaming Platt\u2019s version on repeat, daydreaming about what a new season of 'Glee' might look like. But if the reaction to this performance is any indication, the appetite for a comeback is stronger than ever.\n\nRelated: Lea Michele Reveals What 'Glee' Songs She Still Loves to Listen to Today (Exclusive)\n\n\u2018Glee\u2019 Fans Are Begging for a Reboot After Broadway Star\u2019s Viral Cover Sparks Nostalgia first appeared on Parade on Aug 11, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by Parade on Aug 11, 2025, where it first appeared.",
