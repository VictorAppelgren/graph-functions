      "feedback": "Actionable edit plan to upgrade to world‑class quality: (1) Ground the horizon in explicit first‑principles anchors and regimes, not just narratives—add a short section mapping real rate differentials (policy rate 4.25–4.5% with Powell’s Jackson Hole dovish tilt vs. 2% inflation target and flexible average regime), policy‑reaction function logic, and a productivity/stock‑flow view (tie to ETH/Treasury demand and stablecoins). (2) Build a formal regime framework with transition conditions: Base Case (gradual easing with ETF and treasury demand supporting ETH leadership), Policy Surprise Upside (earlier/persistently easier policy), and Policy Surprise Downside (hawkish shift/tighter regs). State trigger levels from sources (Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks signaling possible cuts; five‑year policy framework review; GENIUS Act and Project Crypto expanding institutional access) and quantify transitions qualitatively and, where possible, with ranges. (3) Make the crypto transmission channels concrete and data‑driven: specify the channel where rate cuts lower discount rates and elevate long‑duration/crypto cash flows; quantify pieces from sources (ETH near 4,955–4,885 high; ETH staking about one‑third supply locked; ETH ETFs inflows; Bitmine Immersion’s $45 million purchase; stablecoins accounting for ~40% of blockchain fees) and tie them to price/portfolio impact. (4) Strengthen catalysts and invalidation with precise triggers: regulatory clarifications (Trump executive order, Project Crypto), ETF inflow/outflow trajectories, ETF/spot demand shifts, and corporate treasury dynamics; add a concrete invalidation rule such as “if ETH ETF inflows drop below X and staking yield competition tightens, ETH leadership decays within Y months.” (5) Quantify the base case and alternatives with explicit price ranges and timeframes drawn from sources or reasonable extrapolations—ETH holding above $4k turning into a re‑rating toward $5k–$6k in the base path; BTC tracking ETH but with separate macro‑driven pivots; reference concrete levels from sources (ETH near $4,900s; BTC around $110k–$120k in weak macro spells; Bitmine’s treasury activity). (6) Tighten the causal chain to show a clean market pricing logic: policy stance → cost of capital → crypto treasury demand and staking yields → ETF/institutional flows → price discovery, with cross‑asset checks from Ford’s cyclical example (22PL3Q360) to remind on macro‑cyclical constraints; ensure every causal claim cites OGK8WLL69, NL5YYTLF2, and 22PL3Q360 where relevant. (7) Reconcile conflicts and avoid over‑generalities by explicit caveats: fiduciary caution and Project Crypto vs. outright adoption, differing views on UBI/AI identity risks (NL5YYTLF2) and the limited employment effects observed in trials; note these as regime risk rather than baseline. (8) Format and alignment: present as a coherent multi‑year framework with a base case, 2–3 explicit alternate regimes, a short list of triggers, and watchpoints; anchor every claim to IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL and avoid non‑sourced assertions. (9) After edits, add a concise figure/table: a regime map with triggers and price/flow implications, and a one‑paragraph executive summary of the base case, key risks, and watch items, using the cited numbers (ETH near 5k, Bitmine $45m, Powell’s signals, 2% target, stablecoins share, Ford’s cyclicality) to keep it data‑driven. (10) Finally, prune speculative language (likely, could) in favor of conditional probability statements and calibrated ranges, ensuring the analysis meets SECTION FOCUS on multi‑year horizons, invariant anchors, and a clear causal path to market pricing.",
