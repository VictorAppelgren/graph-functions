  "content": "Solomon Pe\u00f1a, center, a Republican candidate for New Mexico House District 14, is taken into custody by Albuquerque Police officers, Jan. 16, 2023, in southwest Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nA failed political candidate was sentenced to 80 years in federal prison Wednesday for his convictions in a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of state and local lawmakers in the aftermath of the 2020 election.\n\nA jury convicted former Republican candidate Solomon Pe\u00f1a earlier this year of conspiracy, weapons and other charges in the shootings in December 2022 and January 2023 on the homes of four Democratic officials in Albuquerque, including the current state House speaker.\n\nProsecutors, who had sought a 90-year sentence, said Pe\u00f1a has shown no remorse and had hoped to cause political change by terrorizing people who held contrary views to him into being too afraid to take part in political life.\n\nPe\u00f1a\u2019s lawyers had sought a 60-year sentence, saying their client maintains that he is innocent of the charges. They have said Pe\u00f1a was not involved in the shootings and that prosecutors were relying on the testimony of two men who bear responsibility and accepted plea agreements in exchange for leniency.\n\n\u201cToday was a necessary step toward Mr. Pe\u00f1a\u2019s continued fight to prove his innocence,\u201d said Nicholas Hart, one of Pe\u00f1a\u2019s attorneys. \u201cHe looks forward to the opportunity to appeal, where serious issues about the propriety of this prosecution will be addressed.\u201d\n\nThe attacks took place as threats and acts of intimidation against election workers and public officials surged across the country after President Donald Trump and his allies called into question the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nProsecutors said Pe\u00f1a resorted to violence in the belief that a \u201crigged\u201d election had robbed him of victory in his bid to serve in the state Legislature.\n\nThe shootings targeted the homes of officials including two county commissioners after their certification of the 2022 election, in which Pe\u00f1a lost by nearly 50 percentage points. No one was injured, but in one case bullets passed through the bedroom of a state senator\u2019s 10-year-old daughter.\n\nTwo other men who had acknowledged helping Pe\u00f1a with the attacks had previously pleaded guilty to federal charges and received yearslong prison sentences.",

      "text": "Gang member gets 16 years for firebombing Black families\u2019 homes\n- Share via\nA leader of a Latino street gang was sentenced Tuesday to 16 years in prison for a 2014 firebombing that sought to drive Black families out of a Los Angeles housing project.\nCarlos Hernandez, 36, admitted that he orchestrated the midnight assault on Black families living in Ramona Gardens, a mainly Latino public-housing complex in Boyle Heights.\nHernandez and seven other members of the Big Hazard gang smashed windows and tossed Molotov cocktails into four apartments where most of the residents \u2014 including 10 children \u2014 were sleeping. Hernandez pleaded guilty to five federal crimes in 2019.\nU.S. District Court Judge Christina A. Snyder said she wanted to send a message that racial violence would not be accepted.\n\u201cThis is not a time for any court to tolerate hate crimes,\u201d she said at a sentencing conducted remotely by Zoom.\nThe sentencing of Hernandez brings to a close one of the most significant hate-crime prosecutions in recent years by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles. The seven other participants in the firebombing also have pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes and related offenses.\nMack Jenkins, the assistant U.S. attorney who oversees civil-rights prosecutions in Los Angeles, said that although the legal threshold for proving a crime was motivated by hatred of a person\u2019s race, religion or other characteristic was high, communities needed to trust that the government would pursue such cases aggressively if there was sufficient evidence.\n\u201cIt only takes one horrible act,\u201d he said, \u201cto reinvigorate those memories of when [racial] violence was more common.\u201d\nThe sentencing comes amid a public debate over whether a white man who shot and killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area last week can be prosecuted for hate crimes.\nRacial violence at Ramona Gardens goes back decades.\nBuilt in 1941 alongside the 10 Freeway just east of downtown Los Angeles, it is the city\u2019s oldest public housing project. It was long dominated by Big Hazard, or Hazard Grande, a gang with a history of killing, robbery, extortion, drug dealing, illegal gun sales and threats against Black residents of the project, prosecutors say.\nThe gang, based in Ramona Gardens, was named after nearby Hazard Park and counted 350 members, according to a government estimate in 2016. It is part of a network of Latino street gangs in the L.A. area controlled by the Mexican Mafia, or La Eme, a violent criminal organization that runs much of the drug trafficking inside California prisons, prosecutors say.\nIn 1992, firebombings gutted the apartments of two of the seven Black families then living in the 497-unit complex. Victims said fear of reprisals from gang members deterred their neighbors from helping investigators catch the assailants.\n\u201cDear Salia, You are my best friend. I will never forget you . I wish you a happy life.\u201d\nIn planning the 2014 assault, prosecutors say, Hernandez used a racial slur as he told seven fellow gang members that the firebombings would drive the Black residents out of the project.\nThe group gathered to make the Molotov cocktails on the afternoon of Mother\u2019s Day. That night, they split into two groups of four to target Black families living in different sections of Ramona Gardens. Hernandez provided the others with a hammer and other tools to break windows and a lighter to ignite the Molotov cocktails.\nHernandez was armed with a semiautomatic handgun during the assault. After shattering some windows, he cut his right arm on broken glass as he was hurling a lighted firebomb into one of the units, court papers say. He bled so profusely that he sought treatment at White Memorial Hospital.\nBlack families lived in three of the four units that were firebombed. No one but Hernandez was seriously injured, according to prosecutors.\nFor the last few years, many residents of Ramona Gardens took pride in a remarkable turnaround.\nAmong other crimes, Hernandez pleaded guilty to: conspiracy to violate the Black residents\u2019 civil rights, violent crime in aid of gang racketeering, and using explosives to commit a felony.\nProsecutors had recommended a 17-year sentence; his lawyer argued for 15. Since 2016, Hernandez has been serving a 17-year sentence on a state conviction for an armed robbery in Riverside County. Snyder ruled that he could serve his federal prison sentence concurrently.\nThe judge invited Hernandez to address the court but barred the public from monitoring that part of the sentencing. She gave no explanation for putting that portion of the hearing under seal.\nAfter the public hearing resumed, Hernandez, wearing an orange prison uniform, asked Snyder to have him incarcerated in the western United States. She granted the request."

      "text": "For political candidates in Mexico, the stakes can be life or death\n- Share via\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 Her campaign rally was already heating up, with a live band belting out ranchera beats on the street, when Rosa Alma Barrag\u00e1n sent out a hastily made video on Facebook in hopes of drawing an even bigger crowd.\n\u201cCome and listen,\u201d she said from the city of Morole\u00f3n, where she was running for mayor. \u201cCome and share a moment. Together we can make things better. \u2026 I\u2019ll wait for you here.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t just her admirers who took note.\nAn hour or so after her shout-out, gunmen in a convoy of sedans and motorcycles crashed the festivities, scattering the crowd with a spray of bullets that left four people wounded and Barrag\u00e1n dead on the ground.\nThe assassination Tuesday afternoon stunned Mexico. But it was only remarkable in its brazenness.\nElection season in Mexico is a whirlwind of impassioned debates and confetti-strewn rallies \u2014 and a steady stream of intimidation, threats and deadly attacks against candidates.\nBarrag\u00e1n was the 34th office-seeker killed in the run-up to national midterm balloting on June 6, according to Etellekt Consultants, a risk analysis firm. On Friday, a city council candidate in the southern state of Chiapas was found slain, police said, bringing the total to 35.\nHundreds of other candidates have been threatened, leading some to drop out. The violence has struck across party lines, but the most frequent targets have been those opposing incumbent parties.\nCampaigning and killing have long been entwined in a shadowy embrace in Mexico. The best-known case in recent history is the 1994 assassination of presidential aspirant Luis Donaldo Colosio at a rally in Tijuana \u2014 a slaying still shrouded in conspiracy theories and doubts about the official story that it was the work of a lone gunman.\nBut most attacks target small-town candidates lacking extensive protection details.\nIn many ways, organized crime has more interest in local politics than in national politics. Control of city halls swells gang coffers and provides a path to broader influence as \u201cbought\u201d officeholders ascend the political ladder.\n\u201cMunicipalities are the easiest point for organized crime to penetrate, but the consequences go way beyond the local orbit,\u201d wrote columnist Sergio Sarmiento in the daily Reforma.\nThe politicians killed during the current electoral cycle constitute \u201cthe tip of the iceberg,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many more have been pressured or have had to accept demands from organized crime to keep on competing.\u201d\nCriminal syndicates seek to infiltrate police forces, seize smuggling routes, corner public funds and patronage jobs, launder illicit proceeds and expand opportunities to extort money from local businesses. Some gangs bankroll candidates outright, while ordering hit men to deal with the competition.\nUltimately, the perennial election cycle of violence raises a profound question: Have thugs hijacked Mexican democracy?\n\u201cThe specter of criminal violence and its objectives are, unfortunately, much bigger than the candidates of any party,\u201d said Javier Oliva Posada, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.\nThis year\u2019s midterms are thought to be the largest elections in Mexican history. At stake are more than 20,000 seats across the country, including 15 governorships, 500 congressional positions, 30 of 32 state legislatures and thousands of mayoralties, city council positions and other local posts.\nNot on the June 6 ballot is President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who began a six-year term in 2018 and has been widely criticized since then for scaling back law enforcement operations against cartels, even as homicides surged to record highs.\n\u201cImagine if what we were living through here were happening during elections in Germany or the United States \u2014 without an overwhelming response from the federal government,\u201d said Oliva Posada, the security expert.\nIn comments to reporters last week, L\u00f3pez Obrador said cartels were trying to scare off voters.\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be terrorized, we have to participate and get out and vote,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen there is abstention, the mafias dominate the elections.\u201d\nHis aides said that authorities have provided security to at least 148 candidates \u2014 a meager percentage of the thousands running.\nIn the town of Xochitepec, in the state of Morelos, mayoral candidate Alejandra Lagunas only received police protection after she announced last month that she had no choice but to drop out of the race.\nSomebody had tried to run her car off the road, and death threats appeared on social media and her cellphone, she explained.\nShe said her 8-year-old son pleaded with her: \u201cMam\u00e1, please, don\u2019t continue because they are going to kill you.\u201d\nWith a patrol car stationed outside her house, Lagunas rejoined the race. But she said she doesn\u2019t plan to campaign publicly.\n\u201cThe truth is, if I had known this would have happened I never would have become a candidate,\u201d said Lagunas, 26, a mother of three. \u201cI\u2019m so worried about having put the lives of my family at risk.\u201d\nMay has been an especially dark month for Mexican candidates.\nThe victims have included Omar Plancarte Hern\u00e1ndez, 57, who hoped to be mayor of the municipality of Uruapan in Michoac\u00e1n state. His political party said he had been kidnapped and remains missing.\nPlancarte, an avocado farmer, denounced the presence of organized crime in Uruapan. His two adult sons were kidnapped in 2012 and never seen again, a fate shared by tens of thousands of other \u201cdisappeared\u201d Mexican citizens.\nA local reporter had asked Plancarte last month if he feared for his own life.\n\u201cWhy should I be afraid if they already hit me where it hurts most?\u201d he replied.\nJos\u00e9 Alberto Alonso, 35, who is running for mayor of Acapulco on the Pacific Coast, was riding in an SUV when a pair of assailants on a motorcycle sprayed the vehicle with more than a dozen 9-millimeter shells. No one was hit.\n\u201cWe threw ourselves to the floor and [the bullets] passed five centimeters from our heads,\u201d he told Radio Formula.\nZudikey Rodr\u00edguez, a former Olympic sprinter and reality-show contestant running for mayor of Valle de Bravo, a resort town outside of Mexico City, was kidnapped and ordered to drop out of the race, according to her party.\n\u201cAll my life I have never allowed fear to push me backward,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez, 34, who is also a sergeant in the Mexican army, declared after restarting her campaign, albeit in limited, indoor venues.\nIn the southern state of Chiapas, angry townsfolk grabbed Juan Salvador Camacho, 39, a mayoral hopeful in San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas. They shoved him into a playground and placed a noose around his neck in a scene that was captured on cellphones and went viral on social media.\nResidents were enraged about what they called Camacho\u2019s failure to complete public works projects during his tenure as a local elected official.\nCamacho \u2014 scion of a politically prominent and wealthy family \u2014 was released unharmed after agreeing to pay the equivalent of about $15,000, according to news accounts. He later denied any deal to buy his freedom.\nAlso in May, Abel Murrieta, 58, a mayoral candidate in the city of Cajeme in the northern state of Sonora, was gunned down as he handed out campaign literature on a street. Photos showed his bloodied body amid scattered leaflets.\nMurrieta was a prominent former state attorney general and was a lawyer for the LeBaron family, which lost nine members in a 2019 cartel ambush on an isolated desert road about 70 miles south of Arizona.\nMurrieta was running under the banner of the small Citizens\u2019 Movement party \u2014 also the party of Barrag\u00e1n.\nBarrag\u00e1n, 60, a grandmother and shop owner, was making her inaugural run at public office.\nMorole\u00f3n, a city of 50,000, is in Guanajuato state, which has experienced some of Mexico\u2019 deadliest violence in recent years. Rival bands battle for control of drug-trafficking, black-market gasoline, extortion and other rackets.\nBarrag\u00e1n had vowed to combat crime and graft and described herself as a \u201csocial warrior\u201d who, if elected, would donate her salary to build a shelter for destitute children.\nWriting on Facebook less than two months before she was killed, Barrag\u00e1n said she had been the victim of a \u201cdirty war\u201d in which anonymous opponents had labeled her a \u201cmafiosa.\u201d Behind the smears, she asserted, were crooked municipal bosses terrified that her rise would end their \u201cgold mine\u201d of ill-gotten gains.\n\u201cI am not afraid,\u201d Barrag\u00e1n wrote. \u201cThey don\u2019t intimidate me. They make me stronger. Because it confirms that we are going in the right direction.\u201d\nSpecial correspondent Cecilia S\u00e1nchez contributed to this report."

      "text": "L.A. serial killer convicted of five 2014 murders faces life in prison\n- Share via\nA man who killed five people and injured several others during a months-long shooting rampage that stretched from the San Fernando Valley to West Hollywood in 2014 was convicted of all charges Wednesday and will spend the rest of his life in prison, prosecutors said.\nAlexander Hernandez, 42, was found guilty of five counts of murder with special circumstances, 11 counts of attempted murder and several other offenses following a six-week trial, according to Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Michele Hanisee.\nUnder California law, a person convicted of murder with special circumstances can only be sentenced to death or life without the possibility of parole. Prosecutors originally sought the death penalty against Hernandez, but Dist. Atty. George Gasc\u00f3n barred his prosecutors from seeking capital punishment after his election in 2020.\n\u201cA verdict in a murder case is never a triumph, it\u2019s just a relief,\u201d Hanisee said. \u201cA relief that the victims can start to move on with their lives.\u201d\nHernandez was arrested in August 2014 and accused of going on a five-day shooting rampage that left several people dead in the San Fernando Valley. At the time, police referred to him as a serial killer.\nHis attacks actually started months earlier, when Hernandez shot and killed Sergio Sanchez while driving on the 210 Freeway near Sylmar, leaving the man slumped dead in his car on an off-ramp, court records show.\nHernandez did not know Sanchez, and there was no discernible motive in any of his attacks, according to Hanisee. In many of them, he seemed to fire at random from his vehicle.\nAfter Sanchez\u2019s killing, Hernandez carried out a string of several shootings in which people were gravely wounded but survived. They included a May 2014 attack in Northridge in which he opened fire on a 19-year-old who was bringing his girlfriend home after prom. That victim was partially paralyzed, records show.\nIn August 2014, Hernandez armed himself with a shotgun and committed another seven shootings over a five-day period, records show. He killed Gilardo Morales, Mariana Franco, Michael Planells and Gloria Tovar, records show. Hernandez also shot and killed several dogs, and pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges ahead of his trial.\nHanisee said video evidence presented at trial showed Hernandez \u201cstalking\u201d his victims on more than one occasion. He followed Franco\u2019s vehicle for several blocks, according to Hanisee, and circled a park in his car repeatedly before shooting Planells at close range with a shotgun.\n\u201cHe was hunting for people,\u201d she said.\nAll told, Hernandez killed five people, wounded seven others and shot at four more, including two 12-year-olds who were in a car with their parents.\nJohanna Archer, whose son Julian was the victim left partially paralyzed in one of Hernandez\u2019s attacks, said her son can only walk short distances with a cane due to nerve damage and largely relies on a wheelchair.\nNonetheless, she said, her son has forgiven his attacker. He is attending Santa Monica College with the hopes of soon finding a job outside the state, Archer said.\n\u201cMiraculously he has no real resentment towards Alexander Hernandez, understanding that he is obviously mentally unstable with the horrible crimes he committed,\u201d she said.\nIn the years prior to the shootings, Hernandez had been arrested on vandalism, drug possession and weapons charges, according to court records. He was also arrested after he allegedly brandished a knife at his cousin in June 2014, in the midst of the shootings, but prosecutors declined to charge him.\nIt is not clear why prosecutors did not bring charges in that case. Hernandez had already shot and wounded another man the same day he was arrested, Hanisee said, but police had no information about that shooting at the time.\nSeveral factors caused the case to stretch nearly eight years. Questions were raised about Hernandez\u2019s mental competency at various points, and prosecutors\u2019 initial pursuit of the death penalty also added extra hurdles, Hanisee said. Trials were also put on hold in L.A. County for 18 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMany of the victims\u2019 families spent time in court during the last three weeks, and Hanisee said the eight years between the shootings and the verdict have done little to dull the pain they feel.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s awful when I speak to them. They are still heavily affected. They\u2019re crying. There\u2019s a lot of tears involved,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the sort of thing that never leaves them.\u201d"
