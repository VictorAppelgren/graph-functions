      "summary": "The Trump administration has intensified its conflict with Harvard University, formally accusing it of tolerating antisemitism, which could threaten its federal funding. A federal task force's investigation found Harvard to be a 'willful participant' in antisemitic harassment, leading to potential civil rights lawsuits if the university does not comply with federal demands. Harvard has strongly disagreed with the findings and maintains its commitment to combatting bias, while the administration has already cut over $2.6 billion in research grants and threatened to revoke the university's tax-exempt status.",
