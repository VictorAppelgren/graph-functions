      "feedback": "Strong groundwork, but to reach world-class level for a 3–6 month horizon, tighten the causal chain, sharpen the catalysts with explicit windows, and anchor every claim to a source ID; specifically, (1) fuse a disciplined, first‑principles view of growth, inflation, and yields: AI‑driven productivity is framed by Range’s 1–1.5% productivity gain (UPV3X2MQ6) driving modest GDP uplift and disinflation, which in turn should compress risk premia, but offset by a debt‑biased fiscal impulse (EPJYXB7DX); quantify the plausible range of rate/policy impact (e.g., if debt service rises, wage/inflation dynamics shift), and pin this to a 3–6 month rate/risk premia trajectory your base case relies on; (2) convert your narrative into a explicit catalyst map with timing: Pacaso’s cross‑border expansion to 10 destinations (Italy, Caribbean, Mexico) and 1.8T vacation‑home market potential, with 21% annual co‑ownership growth and 18%+ IRR‑level rhetoric from Pacaso material (UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F), plus HeartSciences’ FDA/Audited adoption pathway and Medicare reimbursement momentum (ILYC1M41F), and Walmart private‑label dynamics (Great Value produced by Sara Lee, plus BetterGoods) to anchor near‑term consumer margins and private‑label price resilience (YQOMV2HAJ); attach a precise timing window (e.g., 2Q‑4Q 2025 for Pacaso milestones, 1H 2026 for HeartSciences regulatory clearance) and an invalidation point if international expansion stalls or regulatory delays occur (EPJYXB7DX, ILYC1M41F). (3) strengthen the scenario structure with a formal base case, 1–2 plausible alts, and a tight watch list: base case—AI productivity ~1–1.5% uplift, private‑label price resilience supports staples margins, near‑term growth from the tax‑cut bundle, but deficits keep yields volatile (UPV3X2MQ6, EPJYXB7DX); alt‑1 could be a growth‑surprise AI productivity path (>1.5–2% impact) boosting equities in tech-enabled services and private markets (ILYC1M41F, UPV3X2MQ6); alt‑2 could be a debt‑driven stall where higher debt service and GOP policy backlash lift risk premia and compress consumer discretionary/price expectations (EPJYXB7DX, YQOMV2HAJ). (4) infuse the base with granular, non‑platitudinal data points: use Great Value/BetterGoods price bands and private‑label reliance as a market‑structure tailwind; cite explicit ranges from YQOMV2HAJ (private‑label price dynamics, bread lines, and $2–$15 BetterGoods price range) and the 40–60k mile life plus 50k warranty for Douglas tires as a proxy for durable‑goods inflation dynamics (V8TEZOR8R); (5) fix the prose so every causal assertion is source‑anchored and conflicts reconciled: e.g., acknowledge that the “big beautiful bill” expands deficits per EPJYXB7DX, while Range/AI productivity suggests potential disinflationary offsets, to avoid implying a unidirectional bullish macro view; (6) tighten readability and format to fit the SECTION FOCUS: deliver a concise catalyst map with 3–5 dated triggers, 2–3 invalidation signals, and a crisp base case plus 1–2 alternate paths, ending with a clear risk/watch list; (7) ensure citation density is high but precise: after each assertion append the relevant IDs (e.g., (UPV3X2MQ6), (EPJYXB7DX), (YQOMV2HAJ), (ILYC1M41F), (V8TEZOR8R)); (8) prune non‑essential tangents (e.g., extraneous Reddit anecdote unless it ties to 3–6 month flows) and replace with quantified, source‑backed sensitivities; (9) add an explicit invalidation trigger for each catalyst (e.g., Pacaso expansion stall ≥3 months delay, HeartSciences FDA/Medicare progress misses target, Walmart price/volume underperformance) to satisfy the 3–6 month instruction. Overall, sharpen the causal chain, anchor every claim to a source ID, inject precise timing and thresholds, and present a tightly sourced, testable, 3–6 month scenario with a single base, 1–2 alts, and explicit watch‑list signals.",
