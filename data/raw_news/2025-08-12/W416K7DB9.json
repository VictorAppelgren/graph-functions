  "content": "The hot weather is set to last for days\n\nHOT STUFF UK weather: Heatwave could hit parts of UK this week as Brits bask in glorious 34C sunshine\n\nBRITS are set to bask in more glorious sunshine today with temperatures hitting 34C in some parts of the UK.\n\nBeaches and parks have been packed out by thousands of people enjoying the beautiful weather in the past few days.\n\nAnd today will be no exception with droves of Brits heading outside to make the most of the summer sun.\n\nThe soaring temperatures come as the fourth heatwave hits today, according to the Met Office.\n\nSome parts of the UK could reach highs of 34C as the mercury soars, said the forecaster.\n\nSouthern areas including Berkshire, Oxfordshire and outskirts of London such as Heathrow may reach 34C.\n\nSunseekers have been spotted at beaches in Brighton, Lyme Regis and Southend enjoying the balmy weather in recent days.\n\nMany families were seen enjoying an ice cream and a dip in the cooling water during the summer holidays.\n\nHowever, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reminded people of the importance of staying safe and issued heat health warnings for all of England.\n\nThe East Midlands, West Midlands, east of England, London and the south east having been upgraded to amber from 9am on Tuesday to 6pm on Wednesday.\n\nYellow heat health warnings are in place for the rest of England.\n\nWednesday could bring 33C to 34C heat to eastern England including Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire and East Anglia.\n\nAnd Thursday will still see hot weather with 29C to 30C expected in London and East Anglia.\n\nSeasonal averages are generally between 18C and 22C in Britain, and go up to 23C for London.\n\nMet Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said on Monday that the UK is on day two of the heatwave and there is \"overall a very hot, very warm week to come\".\n\nThe Met Office defines a heatwave as temperatures meeting or exceeding a certain threshold for three consecutive days or more.\n\nThis is 25C for most of the UK, but rises to 28C in London and its surrounding area, where temperatures are typically higher.\n\nLower pressure to the west and higher pressure to the east of the country is creating a southerly airflow which is drawing in hot and humid air from Europe, he added.\n\nThe near continent is experiencing high temperatures with France reaching the low 40Cs on Monday.\n\n\"As we go through the week, there's lots of sunshine and the air isn't really going anywhere ... that sort of then hangs around,\" he added.\n\n\"It's drawing in at the moment and then sort of stays across the UK for the rest of the week.\"\n\nFire spread around three hectares of grass in Wanstead Flats, east London, on Monday afternoon.\n\nWales may see its hottest day of the year on Tuesday but temperatures are not expected to break 2025 records in other parts of the UK.\n\nEngland's high for 2025 stands at 35.8C recorded in Faversham, Kent, on July 1.",
