      "feedback": "Overall assessment: solid integration of fundamental anchors (AI/cloud moats, strong balance sheets, cash-flow durability) and a coherent base-case logic, but the Swing-Trade/Outlook needs tighter formatting, sharper first-principles causality, explicit invalidation triggers, and probabilities grounded more transparently in the cited evidence; current 4 movers exist but two lines are under-specified and the probabilities lack explicit evidence-based justification, while the Outlook, though present, should be kept strictly to 1 line if tradable, or clearly flagged as non-tradable if not; there’s also unnecessary dispersion from weather/portfolio-private-market signals that dilute focus on the core AI/cloud thesis. Actionable edits: (1) reformat Movers & Scenarios to exactly four lines, each line strictly five fields: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, with the driver anchored to a single first-principles pathway (e.g., AI/cloud moat drives durable FCF and multiple re-rating; balance-sheet quality sustains dividends/buybacks; moats/pricing power support long-duration cash flows; macro-rate regime governs discount rates). In each line, fold an explicit invalidation cue into “What to watch” (e.g., “invalidated if cloud capex slows below X% QoQ or if 10Y yields move decisively above Y%”). (2) ensure probabilities are evidence-based: assign a central Up around a clearly justified band (e.g., 50–70% for the near-term up if Azure 39% growth persists; 20–40% for the longer up if margin expansion accelerates), with the remaining lines carrying lower bands (e.g., 10–25% for each Down) and annotate the reasoning succinctly via cited facts: Azure growth, UNH/LULU cash metrics, cloud pricing power, and macro-rate signals. Place citations directly after the facts used to justify the probability band (not after the entire line). (3) align the Outlook with the four scenarios: if tradable, deliver a Swing Trade line; otherwise keep a single, concise Outlook line that mirrors the base-case and its invalidation/trigger logic, and ensure the fields match the required structure (Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence). (4) prune the non-core content (Weather, private-market voices) unless you explicitly tie them to cross-asset risk premia that affect the AI/cloud thesis; if kept, fold them into the first-principles chain as supplementary catalysts rather than main drivers. (5) tighten the numeric footprint: cite the exact figures (Azure 39%/21.2% CAGR; UNH FCF >9%; Lulu debt-free $1.3B cash; forward multiple ~13.5x; $368B contracted base) in the Driver/Mechanism field where relevant, and avoid duplicative or conflicting data points across lines. (6) deliver a crisp, linear causal chain at the outset (first-principles: AI/cloud momentum → durable FCF/dividends/buybacks → valuation re-rating; macro-rate regime sets discount rates) to anchor all four lines. (7) ensure no trailing citation lists and that every numeric claim in the lines has a parenthetical ID; if a figure isn’t clearly numeric from the sources, either omit or rephrase to a qualitative but precise claim. (8) confirm the final four-line Movers & Scenarios are individually coherent, mutually distinct (two Ups, two Downs), and collectively cover the primary risk-reward axes of the base-case thesis; then place the single Outlook line (or a 1-line Swing Trade if you deem the instrument tradable) under the required format with explicit horizon, path, signals, invalidation, triggers, probability, and confidence.",
