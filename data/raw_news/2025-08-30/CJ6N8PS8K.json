  "content": "Dani also opens up on the first three months of her marriage to Jarrod and juggling her intense rehearsal schedule with family life\n\nDYE DO! Dani Dyer on wedding moment that made Jarrod Bowen & dad Danny sob, the Strictly curse & THAT X-rated footie chant\n\nAFTER tying the knot, most women plan to spend that first year kicking back and enjoying married life \u2013 but not Dani Dyer.\n\nAfter getting hitched to West Ham and England footballer Jarrod Bowen, 28, at the five-star Langley Hotel in Buckinghamshire in May, Dani\u2019s announced she\u2019s joining this year\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing line-up, jokingly calling it: \u201cThe second most amazing thing I\u2019ve done this year!\u201d\n\nBut with the dreaded Strictly Curse \u2013 which has been blamed for the breakdown of at least 21 relationships over the 20 years it\u2019s been on air \u2013 isn\u2019t she a bit concerned that it could jeopardise her marriage?\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d she laughs. \u201cJarrod\u2019s so chill. We aren\u2019t worried. There is no Strictly Curse. As soon as me and Jarrod met, we just gelled.\n\n\"We get on so well, and I\u2019ve always wanted to have a nice, chilled and easy relationship. If we have a problem, we talk about it. I can\u2019t be bothered with games, and when I met him there was none of that. I\u2019m just so glad I got a good prince at the end. Finally!\u201d\n\n'I WANT TO PUSH MYSELF'\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Dani\u2019s family adore their son-in-law, especially her dad, Danny, 48, who is an avid West Ham supporter. The former EastEnders actor joked he\u2019s: \u201cMore in love with Jarrod Bowen than Dani is.\u201d\n\nBut appearing on the BBC1 dancing show means a chance for the 29-year-old to wow her in-laws.\n\n\u201cI want to push myself as much as I can. I\u2019ve always watched it, but I never ever thought I\u2019d be asked to do it. It\u2019s just such an honour.\n\n\"Last year, Jarrod\u2019s mum was watching it with me. She loves manifestation, so I call her the white witch, and she said: \u2018I would love that to be you next year.\u2019 And now I\u2019m doing it, so I think it was her!\u201d\n\nAmid the sequins and fake tan, Dani will have her hands full, juggling the famously intense rehearsal schedule with her two-year-old twin daughters Star and Summer, and four-year-old son Santiago.\n\n\u201cIt is really hard juggling all three,\u201d she admits.\n\n\u201cI can sort of manage one child \u2013 anyone can do that. But when it\u2019s three, it\u2019s a lot. You just can\u2019t physically do it on your own. But I\u2019ve got a good routine now.\n\n\"Jarrod\u2019s family live four hours away, but his mum is a teaching assistant, so when she\u2019s on holiday she comes down and helps us as much as she can. My mum helps, too. But it can be exhausting.\n\n\u201cThankfully, the twins are starting nursery and Santi is starting school in September. I feel like he\u2019s ready, but I\u2019m so sad!\n\n\"We went shopping the other day to get his uniform, and there were loads of kids in the shop crying, and then he was crying.\n\n\"I think on his first day of school, I\u2019ll be worried about him. But at least I\u2019ll be busy doing Strictly so there\u2019ll be no free time!\u201d\n\n'IT CAN BE EXHAUSTING'\n\nReality shows and school uniform shopping aside, how have the first three months of marriage been?\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel any different,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t. But it was just the best day of our lives. Friends that were already married were telling me to take it all in, so I was just so chilled in the morning because I was marrying someone so special.\n\n\u201cIt was perfect. The weather was stunning. My dad cried. It was a real moment for him, giving his daughter away. And to be honest Jarrod really cried, too. I didn\u2019t think he would.\n\n\"He\u2019s not an emotional person at all \u2013 though he did cry when the twins were born.\n\n\"Seeing him sob like that at the wedding set my dad off again. Obviously everyone knows how much he loves Jarrod. It felt really special.\u201d\n\nLike most brides, Dani had the post-wedding blues after all the planning and organising was over.\n\n\u201cThe next day, I was so emotional,\u201d she admits.\n\n\u201cI was on such a high and everyone is celebrating you, but then it\u2019s like: \u2018Oh god, it\u2019s done now.\u2019 You spend so much time getting all the finer details sorted and you have the day and you are like: \u2018What next?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut at least she had the honeymoon to eke out the celebrations a bit longer?\n\n\u201cIt rained the whole time,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes.\n\n\u201cWe went to Lake Como and I didn\u2019t really think to look at the weather, because I just assumed it was warm. But it rained for three days straight and there\u2019s not much to do in Lake Como in the rain, so we binged the whole series of MobLand.\n\n\"Friends were sending bottles of champagne to the room, so I was having a lunchtime bath with my champagne because I couldn\u2019t do anything.\n\n\"To be honest, it was nice to do nothing because we don\u2019t do that ever. Between football and the kids, we very rarely get to spend a lot of time together on our own. So it was really nice to have that time waking up and enjoying breakfast, just the two of us.\u201d\n\nWhile Dani embraced our tongue-in-cheek, Stepford-Wives-themed shoot, in reality she and Jarrod have a much more equal relationship.\n\n\u201dI am so like this all the time at home,\u201d she jokes.\n\n\u201cJarrod would probably like it if I was! I actually do the ironing. Jarrod takes the bins out, but I do the recycling. We take turns cooking \u2013 but I make food for the kids.\u201d\n\nWhile she might seem like a domestic goddess, Dani\u2019s had some mishaps in the washing department when it comes to Jarrod\u2019s West Ham kit.\n\n\u201cSo, the football kit that Jarrod wears on the pitch is washed by the club,\u201d she explains.\n\n\u201cBut they have their kit that they\u2019ll travel in, so I\u2019ll wash it. But you have to really put it on a real sensitive wash. You can imagine with three kids how much laundry there is.\n\n\"I just throw everything into the machine on the same setting, but his football kit came out completely destroyed. It was all frayed, so I was getting the scissors out to try and cut all the ends off. Luckily, he didn\u2019t notice and I fixed it!\u201d\n\nAside from destroying Jarrod\u2019s kit, having three kids under four and getting ready for Strictly, Dani has also found time to co-design her first collection with Peacocks \u2013 which she says has been a joy to work on.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m getting older, I\u2019m dressing differently. I\u2019m a mum, so I don\u2019t have lots of time to plan outfits and I want to be able to shove things on and still look good.\n\n\"I went for a preppy vibe with rugby tops, jeans, cosy sweats and cute co-ords that are all easy to wear.\n\n\u201cIt was really important to me to have a range that was affordable. I love a budget buy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like nice things, but I think having a nice designer bag with some high street is the perfect mix.\u201d\n\nOf course apart from Jarrod and Santi, the other man in Dani\u2019s life is her dad.\n\nBut the actor \u2013 who appears in Disney+ hit Rivals as well as Sky\u2019s Mr Bigstuff, for which he recently won a BAFTA \u2013 is so in demand that Dani has to keep doing their podcast, Live And Let Dyers, so she can actually spend time with him.\n\n\u201cThat man is so busy,\u201d she laughs. \u201cHe\u2019s having a good time at the minute. Like, he\u2019s absolutely smashing it. He\u2019s having his moment right now.\n\n\"He keeps saying: \u2018I can\u2019t believe it, babe.\u2019 He took a real risk leaving EastEnders, but things just keep getting better and better for him. He deserves it all.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been in the industry since he was 14, so he really appreciates it. The BAFTA win was a massive one.\n\n\"He has the award up in the house. He even brought it to my wedding to show people! He talked about it in his speech. It was really comical and funny, though.\u201d\n\nThe pair have also been filming a new Sky series called The Dyers\u2019 Caravan Park, where they take on the challenge of running a caravan park at Priory Hill and Nutts Farm Holiday Park on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.\n\n\u201cMy dad loved going to the caravan as a kid. It\u2019s been amazing fun. We are trying to make it better, but we are not business people \u2013 we can\u2019t pretend to know it all, so we\u2019ve gone down the comedy route. Dad would love to buy a caravan now.\n\n\"But it\u2019d be really hard for him. He says: \u2018I\u2019d have everyone knocking on my door.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey also spend time together when they head to London Stadium to watch Jarrod play.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d like football, ever,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBut I love it now. I get so into it, even if I still don\u2019t know the offside rule. Jarrod has explained it to me a million times, but it goes in one ear and out the other, so he says he doesn\u2019t even try now!\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, Dani doesn\u2019t even mind the rude song they sing about her at the grounds. Set to the tune of Gala\u2019s Freed From Desire, they chant: \u201cBowen\u2019s on fire and he\u2019s f**king Dani Dyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey sing it when I\u2019m there, but it\u2019s funny. It doesn\u2019t bother me. Some people think they might change the lyrics now I\u2019m his wife, but I don\u2019t mind it the other way.\n\n\"I like the West Ham fans \u2013 they are really nice to me, and so loyal. They come up to me now and say: \u2018Oh, Jarrod\u2019s a legend, can I have a picture?\u2019 or: \u2018Your dad\u2019s a legend, can I have a picture?\u2019\n\n\"I\u2019m like: \u2018What do you want one with me for?\u2019 But they are really sweet!\u201d\n\nWhile the forward has another five years left on his contract that would keep him at West Ham until 2030, there is always the risk he could be sold to another club, either up north or abroad. Does Dani stress about it?\n\n\u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said that we\u2019ll take it as it comes. If it happens, we\u2019ll go. I\u2019ve always lived seven minutes away from my mum and dad, but I would go as it\u2019s his career, so we\u2019d follow him.\n\n\"He has to take every opportunity. I married into that, although I\u2019ve been lucky so far.\u201d\n\u2022 Dani\u2019s collection with Peacocks is out now, available at 340 stores nationwide and online at Peacocks.co.uk.",
