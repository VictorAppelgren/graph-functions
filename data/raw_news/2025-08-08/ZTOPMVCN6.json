Generate Key Takeaways\n\n\u201cPee-wee as Himself\u201d offers a refreshing contrast to celebrity documentaries shaped by estate-approved image control. Director Matt Wolf approached the film as a gay man profoundly influenced by \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse\u201d and its message of non-conformity \u2014 and as someone eager to unpack the complexity of Paul Reubens, a brilliant artist who re-entered the closet and disappeared behind his iconic persona to thrive in Hollywood.\n\nHowever, Wolf didn\u2019t expect the project to nearly break him. It changed him personally and professionally \u2014 but it also earned five Emmy nominations, including Best Director. On this week\u2019s Filmmaker Toolkit Podcast, he reflected on the toll of making a film about his idol.\n\u2022 None For 'Will & Harper,' Accessibility Has Been More Impactful Than Awards Success\n\u2022 None Noah Hawley on Finding the Class Commentary in 'Alien,' Ignoring 'Prometheus,' and Why Ridley Scott Is a Better Hang Than the Coen Brothers\n\nWolf\u2019s introduction to Reubens came through Josh and Benny Safdie, who would later come aboard as producers.\n\n\u201cPaul had met with other directors whom he either didn\u2019t connect with artistically or who were not open to his level of involvement,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAnd I think I had a cocky attitude, \u2018I\u2019m good with complicated people.\u2019 And I am, but this was on a different level. The amount of control that Paul wanted to have, maybe I didn\u2019t fully understand, or take seriously. I figured once we got up and running, he would trust me to do what I do.\u201d\n\nReubens and Wolf had long, personal conversations. Both were gay Jewish creatives with supportive families and uncompromising visions, and Wolf hoped their connection would build trust. He also believed Reubens appreciated that he wasn\u2019t focused on the 1991 arrest or the later, discredited child pornography charge \u2014 which Wolf saw as a homophobic witch hunt.\n\nTo uncover the artist behind his Pee-wee alter-ego, Reubens\u2019 1,000-hour personal archive was key \u2014 but while Reubens indicted he was ready, he struggled to let go.\n\n\u201cI was dealing with somebody who had enormous issues with control,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cI think he would say that about himself at the time. But so do a lot of artists. The difference with Paul was that he had lost control of his personal narrative in the media.\u201d\n\nThe public first saw the man behind Pee-wee in what Reubens called his \u201cCharlie Manson\u201d mug shot \u2014 goatee, long hair, vacant stare \u2013 when he was arrested at a Sarasota, Florida porn theater in 1991. It was an image that would change his life forever. Privately, he let Wolf in, but getting him on camera took time. When he finally agreed, his need for control was obvious.\n\n\u201cThere was a real power struggle that had been brewing and that was playing out on camera,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cI pretty quickly realized that this is part of who this person is, and he\u2019s putting it on full display in front of the camera.\u201d\n\nReubens was especially complex: an openly gay CalArts artist who re-entered the closet, gave up love, and found fame and artistic independence as a character preaching non-conformity. It was a story of someone who exerted the ultimate control over his image, and then experienced its complete loss at the hands of the tabloids.\n\nTrying to unravel that on-camera led to real breakthroughs, but the camera also captured how quickly Reubens could be triggered to mistrust the documentary process without being the one directing it. Wolf had no interest in being a character in his own film, but the subject-director dichotomy that was playing out on camera would become key to understanding Reubens\u2019 complexities.\n\nWolf would make concessions, including letting the Pee-wee creator, who once obsessed about his \u201cPlayhouse\u201d sets, guide the documentary\u2019s production design for interviews.\n\n\u201cI was also transparent that there is no script,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be constructing that story in post-production. That was informative and alarming to Paul because he wanted to be in the edit room every day, and there\u2019s no way I could do what I do in that manner.\u201d\n\nOn the podcast, Wolf described a major fight over the director maintaining final cut. \u201cI remember walking with him after we had this fight, and he [said], \u2018We\u2019re scared of the same thing. You want to control the film you\u2019re making and I want control over my life.\u2018\u201d\n\nWolf had always planned to divide his interviews with Reubens into three chronological blocks, separated by editing breaks. The second block covered Reubens\u2019 life up through the end of \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d It was immediately after wrapping his children\u2019s show in 1991 that Reubens visited his parents in Florida, during which his infamous arrest took place. Both director and subject were well aware that the impact of that event would be inescapable in the third and final block of interviews, which never took place. After the second block of interviews was completed, Wolf and editor Damian Rodriguez cut the first 45 minutes of the documentary and screened it for Reubens, hoping to finalize the deal.\n\n\u201cWe had a basic agreement, but negotiating an involved and long-form contract with the subject before you begin can be a toxic process. It can really freak people out,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cIt is a dance of making people feel comfortable, but also protecting yourself while making a film. And we rode that line hard. So we were still in the process of closing a deal with Paul as we were filming. And it had been established that I would have final cut and he would have meaningful consultation, but the nitty gritty of that was not yet resolved.\u201d\n\nReubens left the screening multiple times, struggling to gather his thoughts. Then, he disappeared. He stopped responding to Wolf, refused to sign the agreement, and wouldn\u2019t book the final interviews. HBO and the production assumed the film was dead. The post team was laid off, and all work ceased.\n\n\u201cIt was horrible. It was horrible for him too, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cIt was just so devastating, mostly because everybody knew how good the material was and what a good film we had on our hands\u2026 I kept telling him this film would reintroduce him to a modern audience, would let him set the record straight after years of malicious and unfair portrayals\u2026 It just felt so devastating that people might not see it. And so dumb. Like, \u2019Why can\u2019t we find a path and make this work? Do not self-sabotage. This film is going to reappraise your legacy.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the time, Wolf had just turned 40. Having his biggest and most expensive project fall apart this late in the process was a threat to his career. His personal life suffered; fights with his partner of two decades became frequent.\n\n\u201cIt changed me as a human,\u201d he said. \u201cI will never make a film the same way again. And I worry in some ways that somehow I\u2019ll believe that great struggle leads to the best art because I don\u2019t think that has to be true.\u201d\n\nThen, after almost a year of no communication with Wolf, Reubens shocked everyone by signing the deal. His attorneys asked how quickly the third interview block could begin.\n\n\u201cI had a conversation with [Reubens] and his voice sounded weird,\u201d said Wolf, describing their first \u2014 and last \u2014 conversation in a year. \u201cHe said some intense things that to me indicated that he may be contemplating his mortality, that maybe [he] had a health diagnosis\u2026 he wasn\u2019t specific, but he did say, \u2018I\u2019m not going be able to be as involved as I had hoped, and I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ve been so emotional the past few years.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry if I did things that upset you.\u2019 And he said, \u2018You didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u2019 and then, \u2019I trust you.\u2019\u201d\n\nJust as he prepared to fly to LA and resume filming, the next shock came.\n\n\u201cI had no knowledge that he had ever had health-related issues, and I get a text from my executive at HBO with a screenshot from Instagram saying that Paul\u2019s dead,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cAnd then I got a call from Paul\u2019s publicist and longtime friend Kelly Bush Novak. She encouraged Paul to record a final message for the documentary. She learned that he had not had an opportunity to address his arrests, and it was important for him to address that \u2014 and he did, the day before he died. Kelly recorded it.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing the final audio, Wolf began putting the pieces together. \u201cI knew immediately what happened here was part of the story of this film,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I went to work the next day.\u201d\n\nSeven months after the Emmy-nominated \u201cPee-wee as Himself\u201d premiered at Sundance, Wolf said he would never make another documentary the same way again. He also couldn\u2019t imagine having made this one any other way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to fully absorb the intensity to which people are reacting to this film emotionally. I knew I felt that way [making it],\u201d said Wolf. \u201cBut I also feel that there\u2019s nothing to be done differently. He was an intense person. We had an intense relationship. What happened to him during his lifetime was intense. The way he died was intense. It\u2019s intensity after intensity, and brilliance and genius on full display \u2014 and so my job was to make that come across so that you could experience it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPee-wee as Himself\u201d is nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special, and Outstanding Directing, Picture Editing, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing for a Documentary/Nonfiction Program.\n\nTo hear Matt Wolf\u2019s full interview, subscribe to the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast on Apple, Spotify, or your favorite podcast platform.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nNarrated by a host of actors including Ben Whishaw and Jena Malone and boasting a score from Deerhunter\u2019s Bradford Cox, documentarian Matt Wolf\u2019s (\u201cI Remember\u201d) third feature, \u201cTeenage,\u201d is stylish blend of archival footage and 16 mm recreations masquerading as period film. Wolf\u2019s doc is a detailed history of the origins of the teenager, stemming from youth movements at the turn of the century.\nWhat it\u2019s about: Teenagers didn\u2019t always exist. At the turn of the century, child labor\nended, and a new second stage of life emerged. Teenage is about the\nstruggle between adults and adolescents to define youth.\nAbout the filmmaker: I\u2019m a documentary filmmaker and writer in New York. My first\nfeature \u201cWild Combination\u201d about the avant-garde cellist and disco\nproducer Arthur Russell came out in 2008. My most recent film \u201cI Remember\u201d\nis about the artist and poet Joe Brainard, and is playing in festivals\nnow. I make creative non-fiction films that blur genre. In addition to\ntraditional film outlets, I also like to show my work in music, art\nworld, and literary contexts.\nWhat else do you want audiences to know about your film? Most people think of beatniks, punks,\nhippies, and skaters when they hear \u201cyouth culture,\u201d but this film is a\npre-history of the teenager. Our storylines feature Flappers,\nWandervogels, Boxcar Children, Nazi Youth, Jitterbugs, and other\nforgotten youth movements.\nThe film is a living collage of rare archival footage, filmed portraits,\nand voices lifted from early 20th century diary entries. Rather than\nexplaining this cultural history with experts and historians, the story\nis told subjectively from the point of view of youth.\nMusic is a huge subject and also an important experience in Teenage.\nBradford Cox of the bands Deerhunter and Atlas Sound made the original\nscore.\nWhat was your biggest challenge in developing this project? With such a panoramic topic, it was important to sharpen thefocus of the film. My writing collaborator Jon Savage and I had a rule\nthat any story we told needed to have a basis in strong archival\nfootage. With the help of a team of researchers from around the world,\nwe sourced over 90 hours of archival footage and 4,000 photos from over\n70 archives. Creating a storyline around this found material, and\ndigging deeper for rare footage was the biggest challenge.\nWhat would you like Tribeca audiences to come away with after seeing your film? Teenage is set in the past, but it\u2019s stories and struggles are\nabout the future. During this formative period in history, young people\nendured incredible oppression from their parents, governments, and the\npolice as they fought to be treated like equals. I hope viewers will\nthink about the youth movement alongside other civil rights struggles,\nand that they will reexamine their attitudes about youth today.\nDid any specific films inspire you? For \u201cTeenage\u201d I was inspired by Adam Curtis\u2019 essay films (The\nPower of Nightmares, Century of the Self, It Felt Like a Kiss), which\nuse found footage in innovative and provocative ways. I was also\ninspired by Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cZelig,\u201d which meticulously recreated the look\nof 1920s newsreel footage.\nWhat do you have in the works? This summer I\u2019m making a short documentary about the illustrator and \u201cEloise\u201d co-creator Hilary Knight with Lena Dunham.\nWhere did you learn how to make films? I went to film school at NYU, and Kelly Reichardt was an\nimportant mentor to me. I also started out in the experimental film\nworld, and that community really shaped me.\nIndiewire\ninvited Tribeca Film Festival directors to tell us about their films,\nincluding what inspired them, the challenges they faced and what they\u2019re\ndoing next. We\u2019ll be publishing their responses leading up to the 2013\nfestival.\nKeep checking HERE every day up to the launch of the festival on April 17 for the latest profiles.\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.
