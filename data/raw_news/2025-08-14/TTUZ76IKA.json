  "content": "The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an internet trade group\u2019s request to block Mississippi\u2019s age verification law, which requires social media companies to confirm minors aren\u2019t using their platforms or being exposed to harmful content.\n\nNetChoice had asked the high court to block the state law as its legal challenges played out in lower courts over the potential First Amendment violations. The online business trade group says the law violates adults and minors\u2019 right to access speech.\n\nThe Mississippi law requires minors to have consent from a guardian to use a social media platform. The penalties are as tough as a $10,000 fine and criminal liability.\n\nThe district court had blocked the state from enforcing its law, which was set to take effect in July 2024.\n\nThe 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court\u2019s block on the legislation.\n\nThat prompted NetChoice to seek out the Supreme Court in July, asking it to intervene on an emergency basis.\n\n\u201cIn a one-sentence order, the Fifth Circuit upended the First Amendment rights of Mississippi citizens seeking to access fully protected speech across social media websites,\u201d NetChoice said in its filing.\n\nThe high court refused to do so Thursday.\n\nAccording to NetChoice, the law affects nine of its members: Instagram, Facebook, Dreamwidth, Pinterest, Nextdoor, Snapchat, YouTube, Reddit and X.\n\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote in a concurrence with the high court\u2019s refusal to block the law at this time that he doesn\u2019t think the outlets will be harmed while the litigation plays out. However, he noted he recognizes First Amendment concerns.\n\n\u201cIn short, under this Court\u2019s case law as it currently stands, the Mississippi law is likely unconstitutional. Nonetheless, because NetChoice has not sufficiently demonstrated that the balance of harms and equities favors it at this time, I concur in the Court\u2019s denial of the application for interim relief,\u201d the Trump appointee wrote.\n\nMore than a dozen states require some form of age verification to protect children using social media.\n\nMany have been challenged in courts by Netchoice, a pro-free enterprise and expression organization, and judges have delivered mixed results.",
