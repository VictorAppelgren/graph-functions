      "summary": "In 2024, Washington, D.C. experienced its lowest violent crime rate in over 30 years, with total violent crimes down 35% from the previous year, according to data from the Metropolitan Police Department. However, there are concerns regarding the accuracy of these statistics, as allegations have emerged that police commanders may have manipulated crime data to present a more favorable picture of crime trends. Despite the reported decline, discrepancies between local and FBI data suggest that the actual decrease in violent crime may not be as significant as indicated by the MPD's public reports.",
