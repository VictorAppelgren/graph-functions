  "content": "COPT Defense Properties is a fully-integrated and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on owning, operating and developing properties in locations proximate to, or sometimes containing, key U.S. Government (USG) defense installations and missions. Its tenants include the USG and their defense contractors, who are engaged in priority national security activities, and who generally require mission-critical and high security property enhancements. Its properties include 195 operating properties totaling approximately 22.4 million square feet comprised of 16.5 million square feet in 164 office properties and 5.9 million square feet in 31 single-tenant data center shells.\n\nWe grade stocks based on past performance, their future growth potential, intrinsic value, dividend history, and overall financial health. The chart below shows how we grade COPT Defense Props ( CDP ) across the board compared to its closest peers.\n\nWhat is the current state of the company's financial situation? We measure the health of a company based on how profitable they are and their ability to cover both their short-term and long-term debts. The key indicators that we use are the Operating Margin, Quick Ratio, and Debt-to-Equity ratio relative to the companies peers The operating margin measures how much profit a company makes after it spends money on wages, materials or other administrative expenses but before interest and taxes. It is a good representation of how efficiently a company is able to generate profit from its core operations. The quick ratio measures how much of a company's debt, that is due in less than 1 year, can be covered using its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and money that is currently owed to them (accounts receivables). A company with a quick ratio of less than 1.00 does not, in many cases, have the capital on hand to meet its short-term obligations if they were all due at once, while a quick ratio greater than one indicates the company has the financial resources to remain solvent in the short term. Debt-to-equity is calculated by dividing a company's total liabilities by its shareholders equity. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly owned funds. Generally speaking, a D/E ratio below 1.0 would be seen as relatively safe, whereas ratios of 2.0 or higher would be considered risky. The chart above shows COPT Defense Props ( CDP ) operating margin, quick ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio compared to its peers. The black markers represent the peer averages for each ratio and the blue bars represent COPT Defense Props ( CDP ) ratio values.\n\nHow has COPT Defense Props ( CDP ) performed over the past 5 years? The two main factors that we consider when analyzing past performance is overall return and volatility Using these two metrics, we can determine if this stock gave its investors enough return for the risk that they took on by owning it. This is measured by the sharpe ratio, which has been used as a primary measure of risk/reward trade-off for almost 60 years. This ratio can be interpreted as the amount of return an investor has received for the amount of risk that they took on by owning the stock over that timeframe. COPT Defense Props ( CDP ) sharpe ratio over the past 5 years is 0.0359 which is considered to be above average compared to the peer average of -0.5916",
