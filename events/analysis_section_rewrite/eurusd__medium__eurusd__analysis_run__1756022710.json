      "feedback": "The draft has a solid through-line, but it needs four tight upgrades to reach world-class quality: (1) fix attribution and tighten the citation map; the tariff thesis is driven by 9JYRMPXB0, not 1443EJVX4 (which covers Black unemployment), so replace any tariff claims tied to 1443EJVX4 with explicit numbers from 9JYRMPXB0 (e.g., base 10% tariffs, potential escalations to 15%/40% by country class) and anchor Apple/other capex signals (Apple’s $100B-ish investment mention appears in 9JYR, not 1443EJVX4); ensure all numbers are traceable to the IDs you list. (2) sharpen the causal chain with first-principles channels, and spell out triggers and invalidations: tariff passes parity to import prices, input costs, and consumer inflation; capex/FDI shifts feed domestic capacity and wage dynamics; labor supply and immigration enforcement alter payrolls and hiring; geopolitical/cross-border actions (Mexico, Greenland/Panama contingencies) reprice risk but are bounded by policy/legal/international constraints. For each channel, add a concrete trigger (e.g., “tariff policy announced within 4 weeks” or “Apple/semiconductor investment approval in 6–8 weeks”) and an explicit invalidation (court ruling blocks tariffs; a major trading partner suspends retaliation). (3) deepen quantification and timing: replace vague language with specific, source-backed figures and windows—base tariffs at 10%, with escalations to 15% (selected economies) and up to 40% (others); Apple/other CAPEX commitments (cite 9JYR); Black unemployment at 7.2% in July; July payrolls +73k; Fed communications signaling a hold with a late-2025 cut if inflation prints converge (cite USAToday Powell piece); CBP border-encounter trends (cite W3CN6QOQR); and Mexican presidency’s pushback (cite 4693XL4AP). (4) improve scenario structure and watch-list rigor: produce a base case plus 2 clearly defined alts with explicit probability weights, tie them to 3–6 month timing windows, and include 6–8 watch-list signals (tariff announcements, Fed guidance, major capex announcements, border-policy shifts, Mexico–US diplomacy developments, Greenland/Panama contingency disclosures) plus a succinct confidence rating. (5) ensure the base case, alts, risks, and watch-list signals all run from the same disciplined framework and avoid rhetorical summaries or non-actionable platitudes. (6) broaden critical-source coverage by explicitly mapping each claim to its source ID, reconcile any conflicting strands (e.g., Trump’s maximalist rhetoric vs. court/policy constraints), and present a single, coherent multi-source citation footprint (e.g., (9JYRMPXB0); (W3CN6QOQR); (4693XL4AP); (N9A7MEOD2); (1443EJVX4) only where it directly sources a number). This will lift depth, reduce ambiguity, and deliver a robust, decision-ready 3–6 month scenario with calibrated risk or watch signals.",
