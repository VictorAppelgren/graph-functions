      "summary": "The National Hurricane Center is monitoring Tropical Storm Fernand, which is 295 miles east of Bermuda and expected to move northeast, possibly strengthening but unlikely to threaten land before weakening. Meanwhile, a tropical wave near the Windward Islands could develop into Tropical Depression Seven or named Storm Gabrielle, bringing heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the Caribbean. The article also notes that the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is projected to be above normal, with 13‑18 named storms, 5‑9 hurricanes, and 2‑5 major hurricanes, driven by warm ocean waters and climate change.",
