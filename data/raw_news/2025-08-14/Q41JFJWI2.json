It reaches more than 95% of the world\u2019s banked population, according to the Mastercard Move webpage.\n\nThe deal brings proven global rails to Zand\u2019s digital finance offering. Checkout.com already uses Mastercard Move in the UAE for insurance disbursements, wallet cashouts and refunds. A similar Mastercard collaboration with UAE-based Fundbot is designed to streamline B2B payment flows by linking buyers and suppliers.\n\n\u201cOur collaboration with Zand will connect more people and businesses to the financial system, helping drive greater financial inclusion and economic opportunity in the UAE and across the region,\u201d J.K. Khalil, executive vice president and division president of East Arabia at Mastercard, said in the release.\n\nThe UAE is a smartphone-rich, innovation-friendly market where FinTechs like Zand and others were first emerging several years ago. In 2022, for example, the Open Finance Lab at Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) named Zand among its four participating banks, signaling early regulatory engagement and digital capabilities.\n\n\u201cThe payments ecosystem is rapidly growing and evolving in the region and offers compelling potential to accelerate the applications of AI, blockchain and payments technology,\u201d Zand CEO Michael Chan said in the release.\n\nMeanwhile, the May PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cGlobal Digital Shopping Index: UAE Edition,\u201d a collaboration with Visa Acceptance Solutions, found that most UAE consumers want to seamlessly connect their shopping journeys across physical and digital channels and different devices.\n\nThe report revealed that 53% of UAE shoppers used or wanted to use cross-channel shopping features at the merchant where they most frequently shop. Furthermore, 66.7% completed an online purchase with a mobile phone and shopped in-store with digital assistance from a mobile phone, the most out of the eight countries surveyed.",

The lab will be an education forum for banks, regulators and FinTechs and will serve as a live testing ground to spotlight the positive impacts open finance has had on businesses, customers and the wider economy.\nTarabut Gateway has played a leading role in forwarding the region\u2019s open banking ecosystem and is the first regulated open banking platform licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA).\nRead more: Is 2022 the Year Islamic FinTech Takes Off?\nTarabut Gateway CEO Abdulla Almoayed said it\u2019s an honor to be selected by DIFC as its preferred platform partner.\n\u201cThe UAE\u2019s commitment to shaping the future of finance and establishing itself as a major global FinTech hub is reflected in the support we\u2019ve received from regulators such as the DFSA. We are committed to contributing to the country\u2019s vision and look forward to enabling a new world of financial services in collaboration with the various ecosystem players,\u201d Almoayed said.\nRelated: State of Open Banking in Europe, Africa and the Middle East\nUse cases will be developed from July to November, and the lab will conclude with a demonstration of the impact achieved in December.\nTarabut Gateway was founded in 2017 by Almoayed as MENA\u2019s first and largest regulated open banking platform for account information service providers (AISP) and payment information service providers (PISP) that connects a regional network of banks and FinTechs via APIs.\nWorking closely with regulators, the company provides the connectivity for data to flow between banks and FinTechs and supports the creation of a thriving ecosystem and an improved consumer experience."

      "text": "The collaboration, announced in a news release Thursday (Nov. 21), is designed to streamline business-to-business (B2B) payment flows via a new platform linking buyers and suppliers.\n\u201cRolled out initially in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the innovative tech-driven solution will boost the user experience by including added-value capabilities, such as Fundbot\u2019s dynamic discount product that incentivizes quicker B2B payments, fast-tracking the conversion of receivables to cash for suppliers and reducing days sales outstanding (DSO),\u201d the release said.\nAccording to the release, the solution\u2019s initial rollout will center around early claim settlements in the healthcare sector, \u201ctackling these significant payment delays.\u201d\nFundbot\u2019s discount product, the companies note, is integrated with leading enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, making it easier for businesses of all sizes to adopt and use.\n\u201cIt features an AI-powered tool that uses advanced algorithms to recommend the optimal discount rate for each transaction based on country, vertical and industry trends to help buyers achieve high acceptance rates,\u201d the release said.\n\u201cIn addition, it allows buyers to maximize savings by utilizing early payment discounts before invoice due date.\u201d\nInvesting in the supply chain, the companies said, bolsters the relationship between buyers and suppliers by accelerating payments and helping address cash flow issues, a critical pain point for smaller businesses in the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region.\nAs PYMNTS wrote last month, embracing digital financing options can help companies improve their liquidity, while also creating more durable supply chains that are better equipped to handle economic fluctuations and disruptions.\n\u201cDecades of globalization have led to supply chains becoming increasingly complex,\u201d Duncan Lodge, global head of supply chain finance and EMEA head of trade at Bank of America, said in a recent PYMNTS interview. \u201cThe ability to join the dots across different platforms will be key to driving further digitalization and unlocking the full potential of global trade.\n\u201cIf investors have better data, they can better understand credit and performance risk dynamics, making trade finance and receivables more investable as an asset class,\u201d Lodge added. \u201cThis, in turn, helps plug the trade finance gap \u2014 a gap that is only increasing as more companies seek to engage in global trade.\u201d"

      "text": "Although not all countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) \u2014 Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) \u2014 are known for their tech industries or their leadership in digital finance, a closer look reveals that the Arab Peninsula is home to some of the most exciting innovations in FinTech today.\nThis PYMNTS series will consider each member of the GCC in turn, highlighting some of their FinTech success stories and elaborating on their respective politico-economic environments with respect to technological innovation in finance.\nOf all the GCC nations, the UAE is probably the most known for its booming FinTech sector.\nRead more: The UAE\u2019s Increasing Role as a Regional FinTech Hub\nThe country\u2019s largest cities \u2014 Abu Dhabi and Dubai \u2014 operate as global financial hubs and are home to some of the largest banks in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). As the UAE increasingly looks to digital transformation as a key avenue for economic diversification, unsurprisingly, the country\u2019s two megacities have emerged as important locations for FinTech innovation.\nPioneering Wave of Neobanks\nOne area where the UAE especially leads is in the field of mobile banking, where a high level of smartphone penetration and a healthy retail environment have allowed digital-first banking apps to flourish.\nRelated: 59% of UAE Shoppers Use Smartphones to Enhance Their In-Store Experience, Study Finds\nUnlike in other parts of the world, where innovation has been left to a rising generation of neobanks, in the UAE, established players were among the first to launch multi-feature banking apps in the market.\nFor example, although its parent company Mashreq is the oldest privately-owned bank in the UAE, the digital-first Mashreq Neo has been at the forefront of pioneering new technologies like facial recognition.\nSee also: UAE Digital-First Bank Mashreq NEO Debuts Facial Recognition\nOther app-based solutions on offer from the UAE\u2019s banks include Liv and E20 by Emirates NBD, and the Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank\u2019s (ADIB) ADIB Smart Banking and ADIB Amwali.\nNot to be outdone by their peers in the traditional Islamic Banking sector, in recent years, a young cohort of neobanks have also entered the fray.\nYap, Wio and Zand are pioneering a wave of mobile banking apps that take the branchless model popularized in Europe and the U.S. as their model while catering specifically to the needs of customers in the UAE and its GCC neighbors.\nRead more: UAE Approves New Digital Bank Wio\nBut their ambition doesn\u2019t stop there. With foreign investment flowing into the country\u2019s startups, alongside the sizable Emirati sovereign wealth funds, the UAE has both the human and financial capital to act as a launchpad for new FinTechs to step up to the international stage.\nRelated: UAE-Based Digital Bank YAP Raises $41M to Expand to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt\nIn fact, UAE-based companies play an increasingly critical role in the whole of the MENA financial system. Companies like Nymcard are strategizing around building regional dominance thanks to the UAE\u2019s established banking center and close political and economic ties to other countries in the GCC and beyond.\nWhat\u2019s more, as scaling startups from other countries look to grow across the region, Abu Dhabi and Dubai are seen as the go-to locations for setting up MENA headquarters.\nSee also: The Key to Solving MENA Banking Challenges Starts With Regulators\nActive Government Support\nBy GCC and global standards, the UAE is generally regarded as having an economically progressive political environment that cultivates innovation and an entrepreneurial spirit. Since the 1970s, efforts to diversify the country\u2019s economy have seen successive governments plow billions of dollars of oil wealth into the cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai.\nThe government\u2019s support has also been instrumental in the creation of several initiatives and business development programs, including enterprise and innovation hubs, technology parks, free economic zones, Dubai Internet City and the Dubai International Finance Center \u2014 all aimed at shaping the country\u2019s financial landscape.\nRelated: DIFC Selects Tarabut Gateway for MENA\u2019s First Open Finance Lab Partner\nAs a further sign of its support to drive business growth, the government recently announced a scheme to offer up to a one-year paid leave to government employees who want to start their own businesses.\nRead more: UAE Government Employees Offered Year Paid Leave to Start Businesses\n\u201cOur goal is to encourage the youth to take advantage of the huge commercial opportunities offered by our national economy,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the vice president and prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai, said in a translated tweet.\nFor all PYMNTS EMEA coverage, subscribe to the daily EMEA Newsletter."
