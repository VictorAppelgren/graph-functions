  "description": "Here's a look at Nebraska football's record in one-score games since 2017 heading into the Cornhuskers' Week 1 game against Cincinnati",
  "content": "Nebraska is one of college football\u2019s historic powers, a program whose accomplishments are central to the sport\u2019s lore.\n\nFrom 1970 through 2001, the Cornhuskers won five national championships, produced three Heisman Trophy winners and became a fixture of the top 10 of the major national polls and New Year\u2019s Day bowl games.\n\nFor much of this century, though, going back to its loss to Miami in the national championship game at the end of the 2001 season, Nebraska has struggled, especially compared to its historically high standard. Over the past 23 seasons, the Huskers won at least 10 games only four times. They haven\u2019t won a conference championship since 1999. Heading into last season, they had gone seven straight years without a bowl appearance.\n\nWhile Nebraska hasn\u2019t been close to what it was under the halcyon days of Bob Devaney and Tom Osborne (or even Frank Solich), it maybe hasn\u2019t been quite as bad as its record over the past decade might indicate.\n\nThe Huskers have been perpetually snake-bitten in close games, regularly coming up on the wrong end of matchups decided by a single score. Even last season, when coach Matt Rhule and quarterback Dylan Raiola helped lead it back to a bowl for the first time since 2016, Nebraska went just 2-5 in one-score games, meaning a 7-6 finish was very nearly something much better.\n\nHeading into their Week 1 game against Cincinnati at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, here\u2019s a closer look at the Huskers\u2019 shortcomings in one-score games:\n\nWhether it\u2019s poor execution in critical moments, subpar coaching or just flat-out bad luck \u2014 or some combination of all those variables \u2014 Nebraska has struggled mightily in close games for nearly a decade.\n\nJust how bad has it been?\n\nSince the start of the 2017 season, the program\u2019s final season under coach Mike Riley, the Huskers have gone 11-38 in games decided by eight points or fewer. Over those eight seasons, they\u2019ve never finished better than 2-3 in one-score games.\n\nMuch of that stretch occurred under former coach Scott Frost, a Nebraska native and national-championship-winning quarterback at the school. Frost\u2019s disappointing tenure at his alma mater from 2018-22 was defined by close losses. Though he went just 16-31 and was fired three games into his fifth season, Frost lost 22 games by one score, 12 of which came by five points or fewer. Each of his final 13 losses came by single digits.\n\nRhule has improved Nebraska in his first two seasons at the school, going 12-13 and getting the program back to a bowl game, but he, too, has been plagued by heartbreaking losses. The Huskers are 3-10 in one-score games under their current coach.\n\nHere\u2019s a year-by-year look at how Nebraska has fared in games decided by eight or fewer points since the start of the 2017 season:\n\nHere\u2019s a game-by-game look at the Huskers\u2019 2025 schedule:\n\n* Game is at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri",

      "text": "No excuses for Matt Rhule heading into Nebraska opener vs Cincinnati\nSeveral teams face must-win situations in Week 1 of the college football season. The Nebraska Cornhuskers are one of them. Coach Matt Rhule absolutely has to beat the Cincinnati Bearcats on Thursday night in Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium. A loss would be a total disaster for Nebraska football. Cornhuskers Wire identified one of the central plot points of this game:\n\"Dana Holgorsen is preparing for his first full season as Nebraska's offensive coordinator after taking over for the final four games last season. The Huskers went 2-2 during that stretch. The new OC replaced then coordinator Marcus Satterfield, who now serves as the Huskers' tight end coach. The Huskers struggled offensively in 2024 after starting the season with a 5-1 record. At the time of the staffing change, Nebraska ranked No. 99 in total offense, averaging 354.1 yards per game. The Huskers also ranked No. 100 in scoring offense, with an average of 23.6 points per game.\"\nMatt Rhule's offense did not make the grade last season. It's why he brought in Dana Holgorsen. Having a few games with Dylan Raiola last season should give Holgo a very good idea of what he must do to unlock Raiola's talents. If this marriage between play-caller and quarterback works out, Nebraska should be much better in 2025. It's long past time for Nebraska to return to the nine-win standard the program counted on for decades. The Huskers would love to reclaim the 11-win pedestal they had in Tom Osborne's best years, but first things first: NU must make the leap from middle-of-the-road to solidly good. If this season doesn't deliver that level of progress, Matt Rhule will enter 2026 in a precarious position -- maybe not a flaming hot seat, but certainly a warm seat with a lot of grumbling from the fan base.\nThis game against Cincinnati should frankly be a slam dunk for Nebraska. Cincinnati head coach Scott Satterfield is firmly on the hot seat. Satterfield was once viewed as a rising star in the coaching profession. Now he might be entering the last season of his head coaching career.\nCincinnati made the 2021 College Football Playoff under former coach Luke Fickell. The Bearcats have cratered since then. If Nebraska can't pound Cincy into the Arrowhead Stadium turf, legitimate questions will emerge about the Huskers' present moment and future prospects as a program.\nThere are no excuses for Matt Rhule. An authoritative win over Cincinnati is the clear and legitimate expectation for Thursday night in Kansas City.\nContact/Follow @College_Wire on X and @College_Wires on Threads.

      "text": "What are the best college football programs? Our rankings of the top 25\n- These college football program rankings were based on a variety of factors, including traditions, fan base, on-field success and recruiting territory.\n- Despite being the most recent national championship winners, Ohio State is not rated No. 1.\n- Some blue blood programs such as Nebraska, Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Texas have gone through title droughts.\nMy program is better than your program. That's the start of the quintessential college football argument. And it's an argument that never really produces an agreement between the sides involved because they are intractable in their positions.\nSo how do you solve the debate? You bring together the staff at USA TODAY Sports to vote on the best programs and produce a definitive list of the 25 best based on a variety of factors, including traditions, fan base, on-field success and recruiting territory.\nHow much each of those factors are weighed depends on the mind of those casting ballots. There's the matter of weighing the historical success of blue blood programs, like Oklahoma, Texas, Notre Dame and Nebraska, that have gone through title droughts. And also programs, like Clemson, LSU and Georgia, that have won multiple titles in the last 20 years.\nWith enough voters to spread out the highs and lows of both perspectives, we've assembled our ranking sure to inspire debate and sure to lead to unresolved disagreements.\n1. Alabama\nAlabama conveys authority, building an international brand from a home base where college football is a cultural pillar. The two most legendary coaches in the sport\u2019s history, Nick Saban and Bear Bryant, ruled at Alabama. Wallace Wade and Gene Stallings thrived, too, and produced national championship glory. Alabama is a recruiting machine that consistently attracts, then develops, premier talent.\n2. Ohio State\nThe most consistently successful program in college football. Each of the past three permanent head coaches (Tressel, Meyer and Day) have won a national championship. The Buckeyes have won at least 10 games in every non-COVID season since 2005 but one (2011) and have just two losing seasons since 1960. Overall, Ohio State has six national titles, all since 1942.\n3. Oklahoma\nThe Sooners ruled multiple eras \u2013 first in the 1950s with Bud Wilkinson and later in the 1970s operating Barry Switzer\u2019s wishbone offense to perfection. Although it hasn\u2019t won a national championship since its seventh in the 2000 season under Bob Stoops, double-digit-win records remain the standard for Oklahoma. Only Southern California has produced more Heisman Trophy winners than the Sooners\u2019 seven. And their poll consistency - third in most No. 1 rankings and overall appearances in the poll - puts them in elite territory.\n4. Texas\nThe Longhorns spent too long in the desert of mediocrity between Mack Brown and Steve Sarkisian, but the glory days were glorious under Darrell Royal, while Texas ruled the Southwest Conference and ripped off national championships. Brown enjoyed an elite run, too, and Sarkisian restored Texas to punching at weight. Sarkisian\u2019s Longhorns, armed with an NIL war chest, enjoy staying power.\n5. Michigan\nAfter a 75-year drought, the winningest program in the FBS finally captured an unshared title in 2023 under former coach Jim Harbaugh. Plenty of Michigan\u2019s excellence comes in the earlier days of college football under coaching legends such as Fielding Yost. But the Wolverines have been a fixture from the very beginning, challenging for Big Ten and national supremacy behind some of the most recognized coaches and players in the sport\u2019s history.\n6. Georgia\nGeorgia doesn\u2019t have to live in its past. Bulldogs fans are bearing witness to the program\u2019s glory days. Kirby Smart incorporated the Saban blueprint of elite recruiting and development to provide rocket fuel to a program that consistently performed well, but infrequently ruled. Herschel Walker and Vince Dooley gave Georgia an elite experience. Decades later, they\u2019re in the midst of another.\n7. Southern California\nThere are definitely a few chunks of modern USC history that don\u2019t exactly move the needle, including most of the post-Pete Carroll era. But the Trojans became a powerhouse in the 1920s and have mostly remained an elite national program for the century since, highlighted by the long run at or near the top of the FBS under John McKay and John Robinson and then the nearly unmatched dynasty Carroll built in the 2000s. USC has also developed some of the greatest players in college football history, including a record eight Heisman winners.\n8. Notre Dame\nIn addition to being immortalized on the silver screen and in some of the most memorable writing in sports pages for over a century, the Fighting Irish have produced seven Heisman winners, a slew of All-Americans, and over a dozen claimed national championships. The program has stayed relevant in the modern era while fiercely maintaining its independence, a testament to its staying power and broad name recognition.\n9. LSU\nLSU fans could teach a master class in elite tailgating, and they\u2019ve had plenty to cheer this millennium, too, with Saban, Les Miles and Ed Orgeron supplying national championships. Since the dawn of the BCS era, only Alabama has captured more national championships than LSU\u2019s three. LSU benefits from being the only Power Four school in a talent-rich state, but it also built a national brand to which it can recruit.\n10. Penn State\nPenn State had long been a national player but didn\u2019t truly take off as a program under the Rip Engle era (1950-66), which paved the way for the Nittany Lions\u2019 long run under Joe Paterno (1966-2011) as one of the top programs in the sport. Paterno captured a pair of national titles (1982, 1986). Penn State has reclaimed its place among college football\u2019s elite under James Franklin and is one of the preseason favorites entering 2025.\n11. Florida\nThe Gators do not own the history of our top-10 programs, but they became members of the ruling class in the 1990s while program hero Steve Spurrier spurred a revolution. Spurrier produced a national championship and branded The Swamp \u2013 and then Urban Meyer and Tim Tebow re-electrified the place with a pair of crowns. Florida\u2019s seven SEC championship game triumphs are second only to Alabama.\n12. Florida State\nBuilt from the ground up by legendary coach Bobby Bowden, the Seminoles became even more of a household name after joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1992. The Seminoles claims 16 league titles with three national championships as well as a trio of Heisman winners. There's also the matter of a record 14 consecutive seasons with a finish in the top four of the final poll from 1987-2000.\nNo. 13 Clemson\nThe Tigers\u2019 success in the modern playoff era ended a lengthy title drought, but Clemson has been the most decorated program in the ACC for decades. The school now owns 22 outright or shared conference crowns since reclaiming king-of-the-hill status from Florida State thanks to championships in eight of the last 10 seasons.\n14. Miami\nThanks in no small part to a reputation for playing fast and loose with the rules both on and off the field, the Hurricanes burst on to the sport\u2019s landscape in the \u201880\u2019s and \u201890\u2019s. Unlike the bunch from Tallahassee, Miami has yet to regain their championship form since joining the ACC but still attracts its share of next-level talent.\n15. Oregon\nOregon had hit-or-miss success (mostly miss) as a program until the late 1980s, when former coach Rich Brooks kicked off a run that has established the Ducks as one of college football\u2019s top programs. Oregon has gone 276-103 since 1995, won nine conference titles and twice played for the national title (2010, 2014). The program has also changed college football with unique offensive schemes and, of course, a variety of wild uniform combinations.\n16. Tennessee\nTennessee\u2019s rabid fans finally have something to cheer again thanks to Josh Heupel\u2019s program save after the Vols stagnated in a prolonged period of dysfunction since Phillip Fulmer\u2019s heyday. Gen. Robert Neyland put the Vols on the map. Decades later, Tennessee won the first BCS championship. In the fall, they say \u201cIt\u2019s football time in Tennessee,\u201d but college football captivates this state no matter the month.\n17. Nebraska\nNebraska has fallen on hard times this century but has a lengthy history to support its case for still being counted among college football\u2019s bluebloods. Five-time national champions, the Cornhuskers won at a level unmatched in modern history under two coaches, Bob Devaney (1962-72) and Tom Osborne (1973-97). From 1993-97, the Cornhuskers went 60-3 and won three titles. Since 2002, though, Nebraska has just four 10-win seasons.\n18. Auburn\nAuburn and its boosters thirst for greatness as the other half of an epic rivalry. Consider, amid a cash-strapping pandemic, Auburn fired a coach who\u2019d never had a losing season and forked over a historic buyout. Less than two years later, it fired another coach. When it\u2019s not firing coaches, it\u2019s enjoyed undefeated seasons and premier performers like Pat Sullivan, Bo Jackson and Cam Newton.\n19. Boise State\nThey\u2019ve only been in the Bowl Subdivision since 1996, but the Broncos have established an identity well beyond their gimmicky blue turf. Boise State has gone to 21 bowls and won 283 games overall since moving up, and after participating in the inaugural 12-team playoff while sending a player to the Heisman ceremony the program is positioned to be among the standard bearers in the next generation.\n20. Wisconsin\nWisconsin has been one of the top programs in the Big Ten and FBS since the 1990s, when Barry Alvarez orchestrated an incredible turnaround that has since yielded six conference titles and seven Rose Bowl berths. This has erased what had been an extended run of mediocrity, though there are fears the Badgers are headed for another downturn in a much stronger Big Ten.\n21. Texas A&M\nGreat minds have pondered how the Aggies have not supplied a national championship since 1939. Don\u2019t blame it on a lack of financial, institutional or fan support. The Aggies are steeped in resources within a state that oozes recruiting talent from every corner. Texas A&M needs someone to turn back the clock to the early 1990s, when R.C. Slocum\u2019s Aggies ruled the Southwest Conference and dominated rival Texas.\n22. Washington\nGil Dobie put Washington on the map by going 58-0-3 from 1908-16. In more modern times, the Huskies reversed a few decades of mediocrity with the hire of Jim Owens (1957-74) before really popping under Hall of Fame coach Don James (1975-92). James led the Huskies to a 153-57-2 mark complete with the 1991 national title. After another dip, UW returned to college football\u2019s upper crust under former coaches Chris Petersen and Kalen DeBoer.\n23. Michigan State\nMichigan State was essentially the top program in college football from between 1950-66, with six claimed national titles (1951-52, 1955, 1957, 1965-66) under coaches Biggie Munn (1947-52) and Duffy Daugherty (1954-72). The Spartans returned to national prominence under former coach Mark Dantonio (2007-19), including a College Football Playoff appearance in 2015.\n24. Iowa\nLike Michigan State, Iowa was a dominant figure in the 1950s and had things run off the rails in the immediate aftermath before being saved by former coach Hayden Fry (1979-98). Fry\u2019s successor, Kirk Ferentz (1999-present), has built a rock-solid identity built around a perennially strong defense that has yielded eight 10-win seasons and a Rose Bowl bid (2015).\n25. Utah\nIt took until the turn of the century for the Utes to become bowl fixtures, but a couple of undefeated campaigns in the aughts and back-to-back Rose Bowl appearances more recently gave the school a presence in the realignment derby. Their fans now hope last year\u2019s 5-7 finish was just a bump in the road as they forge ahead in the Big 12."

      "text": "College football's 25 most powerful people: See the USA TODAY Sports ranking\nWho are the most powerful people in college football? The USA TODAY Sports Network decided to figure it out.\nOur panel of experts debated and discussed the topic for hours and settled on the top 25 going into the 2025 season, with SEC commissioner Greg Sankey taking the top spot in a vote after the list was determined.\nNames like Sankey, Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti, Colorado coach Deion Sanders and retired coach Nick Saban will be familiar to college football fans, but others like Jimmy Sexton, Cole Gahagan and Dave Brown hold tremendous sway behind the scenes. And some members of this exclusive club, like President Donald Trump, may surprise you.\nOur panel of experts from our network who decided on this ranking included national college football writers Matt Hayes and Blake Toppmeyer, USA TODAY sports writers Paul Myerberg and Brent Schrotenboer, former USA TODAY sports columnist Dan Wolken and beat writers Frank Bodani (Penn State), Scott Wright (Oklahoma State) and Marc Weiszer (Georgia). Editors Erick Smith, Andrew Birkle and Tommy Deas helped shape the discussion.\nHere are the top 25 most powerful people in college football as the 2025 season gets underway.\n1. Greg Sankey, SEC commissioner\nWhy he is on the list: Sankey blends the credibility he\u2019s earned from a career working in college athletics with the respect he amassed from guiding college football throughout the pandemic season and the gravitas that accompanies leading a \u201cSuper Two\u201d conference steeped with powerful brands to shape the sport in an unparalleled way.\n2. Burke Magnus, ESPN president, content\nWhy he is on the list: He oversees the live content, studio shows and journalism for a company that is paying billions of dollars to league partners for the rights to televise games, including the College Football Playoff and postseason bowl games. His company controls much of what you see and learn about the game.\n3. Tony Petitti, Big Ten commissioner\nWhy he is on the list: Petitti leads the richest conference in college football \u2013 the one owning the past two College Football Playoff champions. His power and influence, however, don\u2019t quite match the SEC\u2019s Greg Sankey in shaping and leading the sport.\n4. Mark Silverman, Fox Sports president and COO\nWhy he is on the list: He oversees live event, studio programming, production, marketing and digital for Fox Sports, the television partner of the Big Ten Conference. His company funded the Big Ten\u2019s expansion and is a 61% owner of the Big Ten Network, where he previously served as president.\n5. Steve Berman/Jeffrey Kessler, antitrust attorneys\nWhy they are on the list: They are the lead attorneys who helped dismantle the NCAA\u2019s amateurism model with class-action lawsuits, including the landmark case, House v. NCAA. Because of their work, schools are now paying players for the names, images and likenesses. They remain positioned to advance players\u2019 rights.\n6. Claudia Wilken, federal judge\nWhy she is on the list: Wilken approved the massive, landmark $2.8 billion dollar House settlement that paved the way for the current era of college sports, allowing schools to directly reimburse their student-athletes. Just over a decade ago, Wilken presided over O\u2019Bannon v. NCAA and ruled the ban on athletes being compensated for their NIL rights represented illegal restraint.\n7. Pete Bevacqua, Notre Dame athletics director\nWhy he is on the list: Notre Dame remains one of the biggest brands in college football, and Bevacqua\u2019s influence on the sport matches it. Notre Dame\u2019s value on the national landscape gives Bevacqua a valuable seat at the table with major conferences and TV networks when the future of the sport is being molded.\n8. Brett Yormark, Big 12 commissioner\nWhy he is on the list: While his conference doesn\u2019t carry the weight of the Big Ten or SEC, Yormark\u2019s innovative approach to leading his conference and generating revenue streams has strengthened his impact. His aggressive style and business background have elevated the Big 12\u2019s relevancy in an evolving college football environment.\n9. Rick Cordella, NBC Sports president\nWhy he is on the list: The president of NBC Sports since September 2023, Cordella oversees the Big Ten Saturday Night package that brought regular-season games not involving Notre Dame back to the network for the first time since 1959. While not to the level of ABC/ESPN or CBS, NBC is now an influential player at the crossroads of TV and college sports.\n10. Jimmy Sexton, agent to coaches\nWhy he is on the list: Sexton represents a cavalcade of prominent coaches. Clients include Kirby Smart (Georgia), Steve Sarkisian (Texas) and Kalen DeBoer (Alabama). No agent has fueled the soaring coaching salaries and buyouts and the advent of fully guaranteed contracts more than Sexton.\n11. Donald Trump, United States president\nWhy he is on the list: Trump has involved the federal government in the interest of policing college sports, the focus on big-money college football. It seems a daunting bureaucratic lift. Will his actions \u2013 creating a presidential commission on college sports and signing an executive order to reform it \u2013 prove more symbolic than policy-changing?\n12. Jim Phillips, ACC commissioner\nWhy he is on the list: Phillips remains in an impactful position as the future of power-conference college football evolves. He offers another influential voice in the fight for fair and equal treatment of power conferences moving forward, particularly in the College Football Playoff.\n13. Mark Keenum, Mississippi State president\nWhy he is on the list: Keenum is the president of the College Football Playoff\u2019s board of managers, an 11-member group comprised of university presidents and chancellors that holds authority over all aspects of playoff operations. Keenum has been the president of Mississippi State since 2009 and has previously served as the president of the SEC and leader of the league\u2019s executive committee.\n14. Cody Campbell, Texas Tech booster and board of regents chair\nWhy he is on the list: He\u2019s changing the paradigm on both ends: he has spent, and will continue to spend, hundreds of millions on Texas Tech sports with notable gains in football and softball. He\u2019s also President Trump\u2019s point man in the White House\u2019s push for college sports reform.\n15. Cole Gahagan, Learfield CEO\nWhy he is on the list: Founded as a farm radio network, Learfield has morphed into a major player in the business of college sports, serving as a conduit for a variety of deals, from stadium naming rights to media rights to engineering more than $140 million in NIL sponsorship agreements in 2025.\n16. Dave Brown, Gridiron founder and president\nWhy he is on the list: Brown\u2019s company provides the go-to software for college football scheduling. Gridiron serves as a matchmaker platform where schools can view and connect with potential opponents for their scheduling needs. If you\u2019re watching a non-conference game, there\u2019s a good chance Gridiron helped procure the matchup.\n17. Chris Del Conte, Texas athletics director\nWhy he is on the list: Oversees a department that generated the most total operating revenue nationally in fiscal year 2024 at $331.9 million with $325 million in operating expenses. Helped spearhead Texas going to the SEC where it started league play in 2024. That move set off a round of conference realignment.\n18. Nick Saban, ESPN analyst and retired coach\nWhy he is on the list: Even after exiting the sidelines, Saban remains a visible presence on ESPN\u2019s College GameDay and a voice that resonates across the sport. President Donald Trump met with him when he spoke at Alabama\u2019s spring graduation and turned to him for guidance on the changing landscape in college athletics.\n19. Chad Chatlos, Turnkey ZRG search firm managing director\nWhy he\u2019s on the list: ZRG is the most respected search firm in college sports, and Chatlos has led searches for some of the top jobs in football, including Texas, Oklahoma, Michigan State and Ole Miss. He also played key role in searches for NCAA president, and Big Ten and Big 12 commissioners.\n20. Ted Cruz, U.S. senator, R-Texas\nWhy he is on the list: Cruz, the chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, is the face of congressional efforts to reform college athletics. Working within his own party and across the aisle on an issue with largely bipartisan support, Cruz has wielded substantial influence in the college space.\n21. Deion Sanders, Colorado coach\nWhy he\u2019s on the list: He is the single highest-viewership attraction in a sport where eyeballs are the currency of the realm. His heavy reliance on the transfer portal has influenced recruiting nationally. His success pushed the door open wider for former Black athletes to become college coaches.\n22. Bryan Seeley, College Sports Commission CEO\nWhy he\u2019s on the list: Potential. Because there\u2019s a whole lot of unknown with a position that has the framework to be the \u201cczar\u201d of college football as his organization oversees NIL deals, but could easily devolve into a front man for the most powerful presidents and chancellors of the SEC and Big Ten.\n23. Shannon Terry, founder of On3 Sports, 247 Sports and Rivals\nWhy he\u2019s on the list: A visionary in the multimedia world of delivering content, his On3 brand crossed over into NIL valuations that are now the industry standard. Previous companies (Rivals, 247Sports) are trendsetters in recruiting coverage, and used by many FBS and FCS coaching staffs.\n24. Kirby Smart, Georgia coach\nWhy is on the list: Entering his 10th season, the former Alabama defensive coordinator is winning at Saban-like levels and looks like he will be a mainstay competing for national titles. Served as co-chair for the NCAA Football Rules Committee and isn\u2019t shy about voicing his take on issues of the day across the national landscape like transfer portal windows.\n25. Kirk Herbstreit, ESPN personality\nWhy he is on the list: Herbstreit, an ESPN college football fixture since 1996, is the anchor of College GameDay and is arguably the preeminent TV analyst in the sport. His national cache (which includes his ever-popular golden retrievers) has been fueled by his pointed commentary on the sport and his social media interaction with fans.\nBrent Schrotenboer, Paul Myerberg, Matt Hayes, Blake Toppmeyer, Marc Weiszer, Scott Wright and Frank Bodani all contributed to biographies.\n(This story was updated to add a video.)"

Frost posted a 16-31 record with the Cornhuskers. Frost's tenure was ultimately defined by close losses, as 23 of his 31 losses were by single digits, including each of his final 13 losses. Nebraska lost 22 one-score games during Frost's career, including 12 games by five or fewer points.\nNebraska (2018-22)\nFrost led Nebraska to wins in four of its final six games in his first year in 2018, with the team improving by nearly 28 points per game in the second half of the season. The Huskers finished with a 4-8 record, but Nebraska faced eight opponents who were ranked during the 2018 season. Five of Nebraska\u2019s losses were by five or fewer points, with the Huskers\u2019 final three losses coming in a three-point overtime loss at Northwestern, which finished with a No. 21 ranking, a five-point setback at No. 3 Ohio State and a three-point loss at No. 25 Iowa as time expired.\nFrost also lived up to his reputation as one of the best offensive play-callers in the country in 2018. Frost inherited an offensive unit that ranked 87th nationally in total offense in 2017. Nebraska ranked 25th nationally in total offense, the program\u2019s first top-25 finish in the category since 2008.\nIn his second season in 2019, Nebraska improved its win total with one of the youngest teams in the country, as the Huskers had more freshmen on their roster than any team in the country. Nebraska went 5-7, with five of those losses coming to ranked teams, including four losses to teams that finished in the top 15 of the final Associated Press poll. Four of the Huskers\u2019 seven losses were by a combined 17 points, including two last-second losses.\nFrost\u2019s leadership guided the Huskers through the COVID-19 pandemic and an abbreviated 2020 campaign. Nebraska posted a 3-5 record, with three losses to teams that finished in the top 15 nationally.\nIn the 2021 season, the Huskers were competitive in every game despite posting a 3-9 record. All nine of Nebraska\u2019s losses were by single digits - including eight losses by one score or less \u2013 while facing eight teams that won at least nine games, and six opponents who were nationally ranked at game time. In 2022, Frost was relieved of his head coaching duties after Nebraska went 1-2 to start the season.\nFrost did well as a recruiter as four of his five recruiting classes ranked in the top 25 nationally.\nUCF (2016-17)\nFrost went 19-7 in two seasons at UCF, helping turn an 0-12 team into a 13-0 squad in just two years. In Frost's first season, he took the Knights to a bowl game and finished with a 6-7 record. The turnaround was historic, as Frost became the only first-year coach in FBS history to make a bowl game with a team that was winless the previous season.\nUCF led the nation with a six-win improvement in 2016 and exceeded that mark in 2017 with a win over No. 7 Auburn in the Peach Bowl to complete a 13-0 season as the nation's only undefeated team. The Knights put together the first undefeated regular season in UCF and AAC history in 2017, posted the longest winning streak in school history (13 games), achieved the highest in-season ranking in program history (10th), highest final ranking (6th) and set an AAC record with 16 all-conference selections.\nUCF was led by its high-powered offense and improved defense under Frost. The Knights led the nation in scoring at 48.2 points per game and were the only FBS team to score at least 30 points in every game. Defensively, UCF improved its scoring defense by 65 spots in Frost's two seasons.\nIn addition to being the unanimous choice as the 2017 AAC Coach of the Year, Frost was honored as the national coach of the year by the Associated Press, American Football Coaches Association, the Touchdown Club of Columbus, the Lombardi Award and FCA in addition to winning the Home Depot, Paul \"Bear\" Bryant and Eddie Robinson coach-of-the-year awards. He was also a semifinalist for the George Munger Coach of the Year Award in each of his two seasons at UCF, making Frost one of three coaches to be a semifinalist for the award in both 2016 and 2017.\nAssistant Coaching Career\nOREGON: Frost took his first head coaching job at UCF after spending seven seasons as an offensive assistant at Oregon from 2009 to 2015, including serving as the Ducks' offensive coordinator in his final three seasons. Frost helped Oregon post a 79-14 record in his seven seasons, during which time the Ducks won four conference titles and twice played for the national championship.\nOregon never ranked lower than eighth nationally in scoring offense during Frost's seven seasons on staff, and the Ducks led the nation in scoring in 2010. Frost was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2013, and Oregon ranked in the top five nationally in both scoring and total offense each of his three seasons calling plays. The Ducks scored 681 points in 2014, the second-highest total in NCAA history. Oregon made it to the College Football Playoff Championship Game that year, when Frost was one of five finalists for the Broyles Award, presented annually to the nation's top assistant. Frost's quarterback, Marcus Mariota, won the Heisman Trophy and was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.\nNORTHERN IOWA: Frost's first full-time coaching job came in the FCS ranks at Northern Iowa, where he spent two seasons on the Panthers' defensive staff. He coached the Panther linebackers in 2007 and helped UNI to the No. 1 seed in the FCS playoffs and a quarterfinals appearance. Frost was promoted to co-defensive coordinator the next season, when UNI ranked ninth nationally in scoring defense and advanced to the FCS Semifinals. The Panthers finished with a 24-4 record in Frost's two seasons, winning two Missouri Valley Conference titles and earning a No. 4 final ranking both years.\nKANSAS STATE: Frost began his coaching career as a defensive graduate assistant at Kansas State in 2006, helping the Wildcats to a bowl game.\nNEBRASKA: Frost's first coaching experience came during a brief stint on Nebraska's staff as a defensive graduate assistant in 2002, coaching the Huskers in the Independence Bowl.\nPlaying Career (Nebraska & NFL)\nFrost spent two seasons at Stanford - where he was a two-way starter at safety and quarterback - before returning home to Nebraska for the Huskers' 1995 national championship season. He took over as NU's starting quarterback the next season and was the 1996 Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the Year. In 1997, he was a Johnny Unitas Award finalist and an Academic All-American as Nebraska went 13-0 and captured the program's fifth national title. Frost was then selected in the third round of the 1998 NFL Draft and played six seasons as an NFL safety.\nPersonal\nFrost earned his degree in finance from Nebraska in 1997.\nCoaching Career\nNEBRASKA (4 SEASONS)\n-Head Coach (2018-22)\nUCF (2 SEASONS)\n-Head Coach (2016-17)\nOREGON (7 SEASONS)\n-Offensive Coordinator (2013-15)\n-Assistant Coach, Wide Receivers (2009-12)\nNORTHERN IOWA (2 SEASONS)\n-Co-Defensive Coordinator (2008)\n-Assistant Coach, Linebackers (2007)\nKANSAS STATE (1 SEASON)\n-Defensive Graduate Assistant (2006)\nNEBRASKA (1 SEASON)\n-Defensive Graduate Assistant (2002)\n| YEAR | SCHOOL | ROLE | RECORD | CONFERENCE TITLE | RANK |\n| 2007 | Northern Iowa | Assistant Coach | 12-1 | Gateway | 4th |\n| 2008 | Northern Iowa | Co-Def.

      "text": "Dylan Raiola, Dana Holgorsen and Nebraska's path to College Football Playoff\nWe begin with the first meeting last October, and the eyes. May as well have been a neon billboard screaming for attention.\n\u201cHe was worn out. A little beat up, tired,\u201d Dana Holgorsen says of his first meeting with Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola. \u201cHis head was spinning.\u201d\nThis felt all but inevitable with Raiola. Just a matter of when, and who would pick up the pieces when it broke.\nThat someone was Holgorsen, who fittingly was in the process of reorganizing his own unraveling as \u2013 get this \u2013 a defensive analyst at TCU. One of college football\u2019s elite offensive minds and a year removed as head coach at Houston, Holgorsen was breaking down defensive game film last season when hope in Lincoln began to look a whole lot like the ugly that got Rhule hired in the first place.\nTheir paths converged in one desperate bye week, after Rhule demoted offensive coordinator and play caller Marcus Satterfield. The coach whose program was spinning its wheels in his second season, and the heralded freshman quarterback who finally hit the wall.\nAnd Holgorsen, whose quarterbacks have averaged 31 touchdown passes a season since 2016.\n\u201cWe just sat there and talked about everything,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cTen days later, I\u2019m calling plays in the Coliseum at USC. It elevated pretty quickly. It was like learning Japanese in a month.\u201d\nFast forward to this summer, and there was Raiola representing Nebraska at Big Ten media days in Las Vegas. Dressed sharply in a black suit with red piping, a pattern of playing cards on the satin lining of his coat.\nAs smooth as the night is long on The Strip.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more comfortable playing football than I do right now,\u201d Raiola said.\nPATH TO PLAYOFF: Sign up for our college football newsletter\nIt has been a long road, made more difficult by what he saw coming all along, what he couldn\u2019t see \u2014 and frankly, some difficulty of his own making. He knew what he was walking into at Nebraska, and it wasn\u2019t just the idea of rebuilding a lost national power.\nHis name was All-America royalty at Nebraska (his dad and uncle starred for the Huskers), and he played hard to get for nearly two years of high school hype before finally signing. He committed to Ohio State, then switched Georgia, and then made Rhule sweat it out before finally committing to Nebraska two days before national signing day.\nAnd the next thing you know, Nebraska wins five of six to begin his freshman season \u2014 before losing three in a row and staring at another season of failing to simply qualify for a bowl game. Imagine that, one of the greatest dynasties in college football history in the 1990s, working on an eighth consecutive season of failing to win six lousy games.\nThe Huskers eventually got bowl eligible, and a seventh win with a Pinstripe Bowl victory. But the enormity of that weight, the pressure of lifting a program \u2013 the hopes of a state \u2013 from that abyss, hasn\u2019t subsided.\n\u201cThis is what I wanted,\u201d Raiola said. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to be in this situation.\u201d\nSo he got in better shape in the offseason, dropped his body fat percentage and increased strength and mobility. And he dove into all things Holgorsen, knowing full well what his quarterbacks have accomplished in the past.\nGraham Harrell, Case Keenum, Geno Smith, Will Grier, Clayton Tune. A Who\u2019s Who of mega seasons over the 20 years of college football.\nMore to the point: four of those quarterbacks had breakout seasons in their second full season as starters. Keenum had 44 touchdown passes, Smith had 42, Grier had 37 and Tune had 30.\nRaiola had 13 touchdown passes in 2024.\nBut get this: Holgorsen says Raiola\u2019s football IQ is better than any of his previous quarterbacks.\n\u201cHe\u2019s intelligent and highly competitive,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cHe understands run checks and coverages, and fronts and protections, better than anyone I\u2019ve been around. One hundred percent, it\u2019s not even close.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not difficult to see where this is headed, where happenstance arrived and three paths met and the symmetry is undeniable. Rhule needs Raiola, who needs Holgorsen, who needs Nebraska.\nRaiola was talking about the College Football Playoff last month, and why couldn\u2019t Nebraska expect to be there? Why wouldn\u2019t that be the goal?\nRhule added some key pieces from the transfer portal to energize the offense, and more than anything, he kept both Raiola and Holgorsen. It wasn\u2019t long after Nebraska beat Boston College for its first bowl win since 2015, that vultures began circling \u2015 for both Raiola and Holgorsen.\nRhule told Holgorsen he needed a decision quickly, and Holgorsen found himself staring at Raiola once again.\n\u201cI said are you staying? Because if you are, I am,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cHe said he was, and we\u2019ve been full-go since.\u201d\nWant to know how committed Holgorsen is to Nebraska and Raiola? When he started calling plays last November, Holgorsen used the existing offense and terminology \u2014 instead of his wildly successful system based on Mike Leach\u2019s Air Raid.\nInstead of doing a complete install this offseason, he kept Satterfield\u2019s offense and verbiage, and added some of his Air Raid principles. Better for one guy to learn a new system, he says, than half a team.\nHow a play is called might be different, Holgorsen insists, but what it looks like is always the same. If it looks anything like the second season for previous Holgorsen quarterbacks, it won\u2019t look anything like the last decade of Nebraska football.\nAnd that\u2019s the whole point of it all.\n\u201cI know what people are thinking, it\u2019s Nebraska, what have they done,\u201d Raiola said. \u201cWe have a chance to change all of that.\u201d\nThere\u2019s your inevitable. Maybe it\u2019s just a matter of when.\nMatt Hayes is the senior national college football writer for USA TODAY Sports Network. Follow him on X at @MattHayesCFB."

  "argos_summary": "Nebraska\u2019s football program, once a national powerhouse, has struggled in recent years, winning only four 10\u2011game seasons since 2001 and losing most close contests, especially during the tenures of coaches Mike Riley, Scott Frost, and Matt Rhule. The team\u2019s one\u2011score record since 2017 is 11\u201138, with Frost\u2019s 22 one\u2011score losses underscoring the issue. Rhule\u2019s first two seasons saw modest improvement, but the Huskers remain in a rebuilding phase, highlighted by the addition of offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen and the emergence of quarterback Dylan Raiola. The upcoming Week\u00a01 neutral\u2011site game against Cincinnati is seen as a must\u2011win to set the tone for a potential turnaround and to avoid further erosion of the program\u2019s historic legacy.",
