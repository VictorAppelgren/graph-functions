  "content": "SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ: DDI) (\u201cDoubleDown\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a leading developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web-based platforms, today announced unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company is reporting its financial results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d). As such, the financial results for the second quarter of 2025, as well as the comparable period for 2024, reflect IFRS. The Company previously reported its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d).\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 vs. Second Quarter 2024 Summary:\n\u2022 Revenue was $84.8 million in the second quarter of 2025 compared to $88.2 million in the second quarter of 2024. Revenue from the Company\u2019s social casino/free-to-play games was $69.3 million in the second quarter of 2025, a 14% decline from the second quarter of 2024. Revenue from SuprNation, the Company\u2019s iGaming subsidiary, increased 96% year over year to $15.5 million, primarily as a result of the Company\u2019s increased focus on new player acquisition.\n\u2022 Operating expenses were $52.4 million in the second quarter of 2025 compared to $51.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to increased operating expenses related to SuprNation, partially offset by lower cost of revenue and lower research and development expenses.\n\u2022 Profit for the interim period (excluding non-controlling interest) was $21.8 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $8.82 ($0.44 per American Depositary Share (\u201cADS\u201d)), in the second quarter of 2025, compared to profit for the interim period (excluding non-controlling interest) of $33.1 million, or earnings per fully diluted common share of $13.35 ($0.67 per ADS), in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue, increased unrealized loss on foreign currency and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower research and development expenses. Each ADS represents 0.05 share of a common share.\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA was $33.5 million for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $37.5 million in the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.5% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to 42.5% in the second quarter of 2024.\n\u2022 Average Revenue Per Daily Active User (\u201cARPDAU\u201d) for the Company\u2019s social casino/free-to-play games remained the same at $1.33 in the second quarter of 2025 and second quarter of 2024, and increased slightly from $1.29 in the first quarter of 2025.\n\u2022 Average monthly revenue per payer for the social casino/free-to-play games decreased to $286 in the second quarter of 2025 from $288 in the second quarter of 2024 and increased from $276 in the first quarter of 2025.\n\u2022 Net cash flows from operating activities fell to $19.7 million in the second quarter of 2025 from $34.8 million in the second quarter of 2024, driven primarily by an increase in income taxes paid in the second quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe ongoing successful execution on our strategic operating priorities, focused on driving a high conversion of revenue to cash flow, resulted in strong second quarter results as we generated $19.7 million in cash flow from operations during the period,\u201d said In Keuk Kim, Chief Executive Officer of DoubleDown. \u201cWe continue to drive strong monetization metrics for our flagship casino game, DoubleDown Casino, somewhat offsetting the expected year-over-year social casino revenue decline given the exceptional performance in the comparable prior-year period.\n\n\u201cThis quarter, our SuprNation iGaming business generated record revenue of $15.5 million, up 96% from Q2 2024, reflecting the success of our strategies to prudently scale investments to acquire new players for our iGaming sector which we first entered in October 2023.\n\n\u201cOur balance sheet remains strong, which allows DoubleDown to make flexible strategic investment decisions to achieve growth through our in-house development efforts and/or through potential M&A opportunities that could create new value for our shareholders. We ended the second quarter with an aggregate net cash position of approximately $444 million, or approximately $8.96 per ADS. We believe our recently closed acquisition of WHOW Games GmbH marks a significant step toward increasing our competitiveness in the growing German social casino market. We intend to unlock valuable synergies from this transaction by leveraging our combined operational expertise and enhanced scale, again with the goal of enhancing shareholder value.\u201d\n\nDoubleDown will hold a conference call today (August 12, 2025) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results. A question-and-answer session will follow management\u2019s presentation.\n\nTo access the call, please use the following link: DoubleDown Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. After registering, an email will be sent, including dial-in details and a unique conference call access code required to join the live call.

For those not planning to ask a question on the conference call, the Company recommends listening via the webcast.

Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions, and expectations of industry trends, our future financial and operating performance, and our growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of historical fact. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Words such as \u201canticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d \u201ccontinues,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cobjectives,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201copportunity,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d potential,\u201d \u201cnear-term,\u201d long-term,\u201d \u201cprojections,\u201d \u201cassumptions,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cguidance,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201ctrends,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements for any reason or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\n\nUse and Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with IFRS, we believe the following non-IFRS financial measure is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We present \u201cadjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\u201d (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d) because we believe it assists investors and analysts by facilitating comparison of period-to-period operational performance on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. The items excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA may have a material impact on our financial results. Certain of those items are non-recurring, while others are non-cash in nature. Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA is presented as supplemental disclosure and should not be considered in isolation of, as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS, and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated interim financial statements furnished in our report on Form 6-K filed with the SEC.\n\nIn our reconciliation from our reported IFRS \u201cprofit before income tax\u201d to our Adjusted EBITDA, we eliminate the impact of the following four line items: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) finance income; (iii) finance cost; and (iv) other (income) expense. The below table sets forth the full reconciliation of our non-IFRS measures:\n\nThe key differences between reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin under IFRS and under GAAP arise from the treatment of certain adjustments, particularly in the areas of depreciation and amortization, finance income, and finance cost per the respective accounting standards. For reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin under IFRS, depreciation related to right-of-use assets is included within the depreciation and amortization, and as such, is added back to Adjusted EBITDA in the reconciliation. In contrast, for reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin under GAAP, depreciation related to right-of-use assets is classified under general and administrative expenses, and thus, is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA in the reconciliation. The designation of finance income and finance cost in reconciliation under IFRS reflects a change in the classification of non-operating (income) expense in reconciliation under GAAP. Specifically, the non-operating (income) expense accounts under GAAP have been renamed to finance income and finance cost under IFRS.\n\nWe encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.",
