      "feedback": "Your draft largely fails the SECTION FOCUS: it contains more than four scenario lines, an extraneous “Long ETH” block, and the swing-trade format is not in the required fields. Actionable fixes: repackage into exactly 4 lines (2 Up, 2 Down) with the mandated structure (Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %; anchor each fact or number to explicit material IDs and place IDs after the relevant facts). Use 1–3 months and 3–6 months as the time windows, and ensure causal clarity: Up lines driven by CPI/Fed yield-price loop and inflation trajectory; Down lines driven by hotter CPI, tariff/inflation persistence, wage/PCE dynamics or policy stickiness, with clear invalidation points. Tighten “What to watch” to observable events (CPI prints, Fed communications, Jackson Hole signals, custodian/regulatory milestones, ETF/treasury flows into ETH) and assign probabilities strictly to evidence in the material (e.g., 63%, 66%, 72%, 65% with IDs like JPAIHPA4N, Y474W9FO9, OGK8WLL69, SGB2PAZGK, SRC_PRICE_ANCHOR, SRC_BASE_PRICE). Remove all non-format narratives and provisional claims (e.g., Mash), and ensure the swing-trade block uses the exact fields: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100; propose a single ETH swing-line (e.g., Up | 1–3 months | Entry 4,000 | Stop 3,900 | Target 5,000 | R/R ~1.25 | Invalidation close below 3,900 | Trigger close above 4,200 | Prob 64% | Conf 72) anchored to the base anchors (ETH 4k–5k; 110k–125k for BTC) with citations only where facts/numbers are asserted. Finally, consolidate the macro-to-asset narrative into a crisp, first-principles causal chain and remove any contradictory or speculative elements; ensure all critical sources are covered by one or two targeted IDs per line and maintain a tight, editor-ready cadence.",
