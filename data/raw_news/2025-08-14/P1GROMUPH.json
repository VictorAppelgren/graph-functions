      "text": "\u201cAppTech has been our payment processing vendor for quite some time now. Their rates and fees were lower in every category than the vendor we were using. Their ability to assist us in both our face-to-face transactions and our e-commerce processing has been extremely helpful. Their attention to detail and willingness to help with any situation that comes up makes them a valuable asset.\u201d\n- Patrick Clouden, CEO Consumer Energy Solutions (Tampa, FL)\n\u201cAppTech Merchant Services is a reliable, low-cost payment provider that I can recommend to my e-commerce clients. It's easily integrated into shopping carts and custom scripts using their APIs. Technical support is always helpful when I do have questions during development.\"\n- Michelle Shinn, CEO Cross Fire Marketing Group (Cleveland, OH)\n\"AppTech consistently has excellent customer service, and I am always very impressed with how fast they are able to help assist me by both phone and email - especially someone like me who has minimal knowledge about the industry and always asks A LOT of questions! Last year I changed the name of my business which was a bit of a headache, to say the least, thankfully the Team was able to help me transfer smoothly and without any added stress. I have recommended AppTech Payments to everyone that asks about my processing company and will continue to do so - I honestly would never go with another company! Thank you, AppTech!\u201d\n- Neal Cantone, Co-owner\nPomona Print Stop (Rancho Cucamonga, CA)"
