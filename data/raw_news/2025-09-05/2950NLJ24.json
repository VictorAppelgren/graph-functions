  "title": "Lenovo's New Thunderbolt Docks Have All The Ports You Need",
  "description": "There's one for everyone here.",
  "content": "Finding the right Thunderbolt/USB dock can be tricky. Some have a lot of ports, while others don't go too hard on the port selection to bring the price down. If you're still undecided, Lenovo just launched three different options for three different kinds of users.\n\nLenovo has just unveiled its new range of Thunderbolt and USB docks. There are three options to look at here: your average, run-of-the-mill Thunderbolt 4 dock, a bleeding-edge Thunderbolt 5 dock, and a cheaper USB 4 option if you don't have Thunderbolt in your computer.\n\nThe Thunderbolt 5 option is the Lenovo ThinkPad Thunderbolt 5 Smart Dock 7500. This model is the first in Lenovo's hardware range to incorporate the latest Thunderbolt 5 standard, which provides a total bandwidth of up to 120 Gbps. The dock can drive up to three 8K displays at a 60Hz refresh rate simultaneously with an additional 4K display at 60Hz. For applications requiring higher refresh rates, such as video editing or design, it also supports configurations like dual 4K displays at 240Hz combined with another two 4K displays at 120Hz. To power high-performance laptops and connected peripherals, the dock delivers up to 180W of power via the Power Delivery (PD) 3.1 standard.\n\nThen, one tier below, we have the ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 Smart Dock Gen 2 7500. This dock can drive either a single 8K display at 60Hz or dual 4K displays at a smooth 144Hz refresh rate. It provides up to 100W of power through PD 3.1 and features four always-on USB charging ports on the front for convenient access to power for smartphones and other devices, even when a laptop is not connected.\n\nFinally, to round things out, we have the ThinkPad USB4 Smart Dock 5500. This dock leverages the USB 4 standard rather than Thunderbolt, which offers four times the bandwidth of previous USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 docks. USB 4, if you're not familiar, is basically standardized Thunderbolt 3. Its display output capabilities actually match those of the Thunderbolt 4 model, supporting a single 8K monitor at 60Hz or dual 4K monitors at 144Hz. It also delivers up to 100W of charging power with PD 3.1. Pretty cool.\n\nThis is part of Lenovo's business announcements, and these docks have some business-y features that make them pretty nice for deploying in a business context. Each device is supported by Lenovo Accessories Fleet Manager, a cloud-based software solution that allows IT departments to manage and monitor their organization's docking stations remotely. But it's not illegal to use these in personal computers, and they might actually do the job pretty well.\n\nThe only problem with them might be the price. The Thunderbolt 5 unit costs a whopping $550, while the Thunderbolt 4 model goes down to $380. The USB 4 model is the cheapest, at $270. All three models are set to go on sale in \"Q3 2025,\" and Q3 ends this month, so keep an eye on Lenovo's website.",
