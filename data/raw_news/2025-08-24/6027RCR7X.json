  "description": "\"Playing silly games like this just wastes everyone's time.\"",
  "content": "\"Constant frantic rush jobs mask a dysfunctional system. In the panic to get things done, it's easy to ask, 'So why is this a rush job in the first place?' It means a lack of planning or a sales guy who overpromised.\" \"I've been in advertising for 35 years. And I've had an agency for 30 of those years. With the exception of a client's building burning down, any rush job means that someone, somewhere, didn't do his or her job. So if an account executive wound up having a rush job, he or she wasn't allowed to blithely make the request and then go home for the night. Instead, if the creative team was staying late, the account executive had to stay late too. Amazing how that cut down on rush jobs.\" \"I worked for longer than I should have at a place where there were so many 'emergencies' that were caused by someone else not doing their job. When everything is an emergency, nothing is an emergency.\"\n\n\"Definitely. You can't have a great business if your employees are miserable.\" \"Not to mention, if the turnover rate is high, there's no stability. It usually takes anywhere from six months to a year for a person at a new job to actually become comfortable and good at their job. With high turnover, it's basically the blind leading the blind.\"\n\n\"When you are told, 'We want you to hit the ground running.' I\u2019ve experienced that as them providing little training or wanting to put in any real effort because they are perpetually busy. You are on your own to figure it out.\" \"Oh, that's my job. This translates to 'training is provided through disciplinary action only.' You know, you don't do a thing you're supposed to do. You only find out for the first time you were supposed to do that thing when you're getting a write-up and an unpaid suspension. Very common bullshit.\"\n\n\"Management is hired from outside instead of from experienced people within the company.\" \"I've had countless highly overpaid 'unicorns' as my new boss come in for about two years: here is the exact order of operation: first 6-9 months meet with folks, 'listen' and do nothing. Next 6-9 months, change a few things, for the sake of changing things. Final 6-9 months, look for another even higher-paying job elsewhere on the company dime. Leave. (Do they teach this shit in business school?) Finally, the cycle of these dudes ended, and they promoted the smartest, most hardworking lady in our group to run the group. No wasted time meeting folks or causing chaos, just doing her old work and her new work.\"\n\n\"Coworkers who immediately and aggressively want to be your best friend just so they can sabotage you in a variety of ways. I've seen it a million times with my own employees. I know you can make great friends at work, but there's also this. Be careful with your personal info.\" \"It's not just the drama that goes down in a space you spend 40 hours a week with people. Some of them mine your personal information to wield it against you. Every innocent remark is potential fodder, every boundary drawn is a slight, and there are no rules when you think there are rules. Some people see social interaction as a zero-sum competition.\"",

Steves, who has been in advertising for 35 years, explains that rush jobs often indicate someone not doing their job. He suggests that if an account executive is having a rush job, the creative team would have to stay late. He also notes that high turnover leads to a lack of stability in a new job and takes up to a year to become comfortable and good at their job, and that management is often brought in from outside rather than from within the company. Stees also shares personal information with colleagues, suggesting that employees are often manipulated by their colleagues to manipulate them.",

  "argos_summary": "The article laments a culture of constant rush jobs that stem from poor planning and overpromised deadlines, which in turn fuels high employee turnover and a lack of stability. It criticizes inadequate training\u2014often delivered only through disciplinary action\u2014and the tendency for managers to be hired externally, leading to ineffective leadership and a cycle of short\u2011term hires. The piece also highlights toxic workplace dynamics, where coworkers may sabotage each other and exploit personal information, creating a hostile environment that undermines productivity and morale.",
