  "description": "Eight cities are recognized by the Bloomberg Philanthropies for lowering speeds and other strategies to prevent and reduce speed-related crash injuries and fatalities.",
  "content": "Eight cities around the world have been recognized for their efforts to lower speed limits and other strategies to prevent and reduce speed-related road crash injuries and fatalities. Winners in the first-ever Speed Challenge, including Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, which experienced zero fatalities in the first six months after implementing a series of safety initiatives, were announced on Wednesday by Bloomberg Philanthropies.\n\n\u201cSpeeding kills 1,600 people every day,\u201d Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies, WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries, and the 108th mayor of New York City, said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s a leading cause of preventable injuries and deaths worldwide.\u201d\n\nDriving at a higher speed significantly increases the likelihood of a crash occurring and the severity of its consequence. It\u2019s a in about a third of motor vehicle deaths in the United States and other high-income countries, and a half in some low- and middle-income countries, according to the (WHO). But strategies like reducing speed, even by 5%, can reduce deaths by 30% .\n\nThe awards were given based on a city\u2019s success in adopting the WHO\u2019s recommended speed limit \u2013 under 50 kilometers per hour, (about 30 miles per hour) in urban areas and under 30 km/h (about 18 mph) in high-risk zones, like around schools and hospitals.\n\nThe honored cities also implemented a range of strategies to reduce dangerous speeding: redesigning city streets, incorporating features like speed humps and raised pedestrian crossings; enhancing enforcement, and promoting media campaigns to raise awareness.\n\nThe winners will receive from $50,000 to $100,000 to further advance their efforts. In addition to lowering speed limits to meet WHO recommendations, the cites and their specific accomplishments are:\n\nAddis Ababa, Ethiopia sustained speed enforcement operations, and installed more than 640 concrete and 1,500 rubber speed humps citywide, including in school zones. Crash data from specific locations show that 37 lives were saved because of the interventions.\n\nBogot\u00e1, Colombia installed parabolic speed humps, which were previously not authorized in 50 km/h corridors, and sustained police speed enforcement. The city experienced zero fatalities in the first six months of implementation, an 82% decrease in injuries to vulnerable road users, like pedestrians and cyclists, and 60% fewer vehicles exceeding speed limits in school zones.\n\nBengaluru, India redesigned 75 intersections throughout the city, which slowed traffic and increased safety, and enforced speeding by using a toll booth autopay system to recover fines.\n\nBuenos Aires, Argentina introduced a speed limit reduction to 50 km/h on select high-risk roads and upgraded enforcement technology, including fixed speed cameras and mobile speed measuring devices like hand-held radar guns.\n\nGuadalajara, Mexico adopted a policy to allow the city\u2019s mobility department to enforce speed limits, updated regulations to include defined speed limits near schools, and implemented standardized traffic signs.\n\nKampala, Uganda contributed to national road safety regulations and installed raised pedestrian crossings near 20 schools.\n\nMombasa, Kenya constructed speed humps and raised pedestrian crossings near five schools, and aired a media campaign, \u201cSlow Down, Speeding Ruins Lives.\u201d\n\nQuito, Ecuador developed the city\u2019s first Road Safety Ordinance, which focuses on data-driven enforcement, a citywide safety plan, a specialized road safety unit, and enhanced speed enforcement through portable cameras, leading to a 32% reduction in traffic fatalities during the enforcement campaign.\n\n\u201cRoad safety is a pressing global public health challenge,\u201d Kelly Henning, public health program lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies, told Forbes. estimates, she noted, show that speeding claims the lives of some 600,000 people each year, about half of the world\u2019s .\n\n\u201cLike many of the other public health issues Bloomberg Philanthropies addresses, road safety challenges are concentrated in low- and middle-income countries, where over 90 % of road crash fatalities occur,\u201d Dr. Henning said. \u201cThese countries also often lack the support necessary to tackle threats like inadequate road safety laws, limited police enforcement of existing laws, and street designs that do not consider road users like pedestrians and cyclists.\u201d\n\nShe said the Speed Challenge fits into the more robust goals of the Initiative for Global Road Safety \u201cby spotlighting the most effective actions cities have taken to save lives and inspiring other jurisdictions to follow their lead.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, click .",

      "text": "Key facts\n- Approximately 1.19 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes.\n- Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5\u201329 years.\n- 92% of the world's fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries have around 60% of the world's vehicles.\n- More than half of all road traffic deaths are among vulnerable road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists.\n- Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.\n- The United Nations General Assembly has set an ambitious target of halving the global number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2030 (A/RES/74/299).\nOverview\nEvery year the lives of approximately 1.19 million people are cut short as a result of a road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability.\nRoad traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product.\nWho is at risk?\nSocioeconomic status\nMore than 90% of road traffic deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Road traffic death rates are highest in the WHO African Region and lowest in the European Region. Even within high-income countries, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to be involved in road traffic crashes.\nAge\nRoad traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5\u201329 years. Two thirds of road traffic fatalities occur among people of working age (18\u201359 years),\nSex\nMales are typically 3 times more likely to be killed in road crashes than females.\nRisk factors\nThe safe system approach: accommodating human error\nTransport systems should be responsive to the needs of users and forgiving of human error. The safe system approach to road safety aims to ensure a safe transport system for all road users. This approach takes into account people\u2019s vulnerability to serious injuries and recognizes that the system should be designed to accommodate human error. The cornerstones of this approach are safe roads and roadsides, safe speeds, safe vehicles, and safe road users, all of which must be addressed in order to eliminate fatal crashes and reduce serious injuries.\nSpeeding\n- An increase in average speed is directly related both to the likelihood of a crash occurring and to the severity of the consequences of the crash. For example, every 1% increase in mean speed produces a 4% increase in the fatal crash risk and a 3% increase in the serious crash risk.\n- The risk of death for pedestrians hit by car fronts rises rapidly (4.5 times from 50 km/h to 65 km/h).\n- In car-to-car side impacts the fatality risk for car occupants is 85% at 65 km/h.\nDriving under the influence of alcohol and other psychoactive substances\n- Driving under the influence of alcohol and any psychoactive substance or drug increases the risk of a crash that results in death or serious injuries.\n- In the case of drink-driving, the risk of a road traffic crash starts at low levels of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and increases significantly when the driver's BAC is \u2265 0.04 g/dl.\n- In the case of drug-driving, the risk of incurring a road traffic crash is increased to differing degrees depending on the psychoactive drug used. For example, the risk of a fatal crash occurring among those who have used amphetamines is about 5 times the risk of someone who hasn't.\nNon-use of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts and child restraints\n- Correct helmet use can reduce the risk of death in a crash by more than 6 times and the risk of brain injury by up to 74%.\n- Wearing a seat-belt can reduce the risk of death among vehicle occupants by up to 50%.\n- The use of child restraints can lead to a 71% reduction in deaths among infants.\nDistracted driving\nThere are many types of distractions that can lead to impaired driving. The distraction caused by mobile phones is a growing concern for road safety.\n- Drivers using mobile phones are approximately 4 times more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers not using a mobile phone. Using a phone while driving slows reaction times (notably braking reaction time, but also reaction to traffic signals), and makes it difficult to keep in the correct lane, and to keep the correct following distances.\n- Hands-free phones are not much safer than hand-held phone sets. Texting considerably increases the risk of a crash.\nUnsafe road infrastructure\nThe design of roads can have a considerable impact on their safety. Ideally, roads should be designed keeping in mind the safety of all road users. This would mean making sure that there are adequate facilities for pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Measures such as footpaths, cycling lanes, safe crossing points and other traffic calming measures can be critical to reducing the risk of injury among these road users.\nUnsafe vehicles\nSafe vehicles play a critical role in averting crashes and reducing the likelihood of serious injury. There are a number of UN regulations on vehicle safety that, if applied to countries\u2019 manufacturing and production standards, would potentially save many lives. These include requiring vehicle manufacturers to meet front and side impact regulations, to include electronic stability control (to prevent over-steering) and to ensure airbags and seat-belts are fitted in all vehicles. Without these basic standards the risk of traffic injuries \u2013 both to those in the vehicle and those out of it \u2013 is considerably increased.\nInadequate post-crash care\nDelays in detecting and providing care for those involved in a road traffic crash increase the severity of injuries. Care of injuries after a crash has occurred is extremely time-sensitive: delays of minutes can make the difference between life and death. Improving post-crash care requires ensuring access to timely prehospital care, and improving the quality of both prehospital and hospital care, such as through specialist training programmes.\nInadequate law enforcement of traffic laws\nIf traffic laws on drink-driving, seat-belt wearing, speed limits, helmets and child restraints are not enforced, they cannot bring about the expected reduction in road traffic fatalities and injuries related to specific behaviours. Thus, if traffic laws are not enforced or are perceived as not being enforced, it is likely they will not be complied with and therefore will have very little chance of influencing behaviour.\nEffective enforcement includes establishing, regularly updating, and enforcing laws at the national, municipal, and local levels that address the above mentioned risk factors. It includes also the definition of appropriate penalties.\nPrevention\nRoad traffic injuries can be prevented. Governments must take action to address road safety in a holistic manner. This requires involvement from multiple sectors such as transport, police, health and education, as well as the private sector and civil society organizations. It requires actions that address the safety of roads, vehicles and all road users.\nEffective interventions include designing safer infrastructure and incorporating road safety features into land-use and transport planning, improving the safety features of vehicles; enhancing post-crash care for victims of road traffic crashes; setting and enforcing laws relating to key risks, and raising public awareness.\nWHO response\nWHO works with Member States and partners across sectors to support road safety evaluation, implementation and planning. As the lead agency for road safety in the United Nations, WHO plays a key role in guiding global efforts by advocating for road safety at the highest levels, compiling and sharing good practices and raising awareness of road safety.\nWHO serves as the secretariat for the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021\u20132030, which aims to reduce road traffic deaths and injuries by at least 50% by 2030. This includes convening a global network of heads of national road safety agencies, producing global status reports to track progress, and providing technical assistance.\nWHO works with a range of partners to provide technical support to countries. For example, WHO works with the Bloomberg Initiative for Global Road Safety (BIGRS) to reduce fatalities and injuries from road traffic crashes in a range of low- and middle-income countries.\nWHO chairs the UN Road Safety Collaboration mechanism and organizes and hosts, with key partners, high profile advocacy events such as UN road safety weeks and the annual World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims."

      "text": "The Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety\nThe Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety helps to implement a comprehensive package of activities proven to save lives. In partnership with international organizations and governments, it focuses on five key areas to improve road safety and save lives: strengthening national legislation; enhancing data collection and surveillance; changing road user behavior; improving road infrastructure; and upgrading vehicle safety.\nSince 2007, Bloomberg Philanthropies has saved lives and reduced injuries from traffic crashes by supporting the implementation of road safety interventions in more than 50 cities and provinces, supporting stronger national road safety policies in 21 countries, and improving vehicle safety standards in four regional markets. Between 2007, when the initiative\u2019s work began, and 2030, those efforts are projected to save nearly 312,000 lives.\nIn addition, partners have trained over 125,000 professionals in road safety strategies, including communications, police enforcement, and safe infrastructure design, launched more than 90 media campaigns, and crash-tested over 90 vehicle models across the Americas, Asia, and Africa. To date, nearly 3.7 billion people are covered by newly strengthened road safety laws with support from the initiative.\nSpecific activities supported by the Initiative for Global Road Safety include:\n- Reviewing legislation and providing recommendations to strengthen road safety laws to meet international best practice\n- Creating global resources for road safety, such as fact sheets and digital media content, that can be accessed online for free\n- Supporting public and nonprofit efforts to implement effective road safety laws through funding and technical assistance\n- Enhancing training for professionals and frontline workers, especially traffic police, to better enforce road safety laws\n- Developing message-tested and evidence-based mass media campaigns to educate the public and increase seat belt and helmet use and reduce drinking and driving and speeding\n- Supporting municipal and national governments in designing safer modes of transit, including mass transportation systems, walking infrastructure, and bike routes\n- Improving infrastructure projects by assessing high-risk roads and recommending safety improvements\n- Monitoring and analyzing traffic-related deaths, injuries, and policy effectiveness\n- Supporting embedded staff in city halls to review project plans and coordinate implementation of best-practice road safety interventions across 27 cities\n- Funding crash tests of top-selling cars in emerging markets and publishing their results to advance vehicle safety standards\nTo learn more about global road safety efforts, visit the Road Safety Resource Hub.\nTop photo: A redesigned intersection in Quito increases pedestrian safety."

      "text": "One of the simplest ways to avoid road traffic crashes and the millions of deaths and injuries they cause is to slow down. This warning is the World Health Organization (WHO) theme for the upcoming United Nations Global Road Safety Week.\nMore than 1.2 million people a year die from road traffic injuries, many young, taken in the prime of their lives. In the WHO Region for the Western Pacific alone, nearly 900 people are killed each day on the roads, with speed being a major factor in up to half of fatal crashes in most low- and middle-income countries.\n\"Each one of these deaths is a tragedy that could and should have been prevented. Even those who survive horrible crashes often end up with lifelong disability,\" says Dr Shin Young-soo, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific.\nIn addition to the terrible impact and suffering of victims and their families, road traffic deaths and injuries impose significant costs on national health systems and economies. Road traffic injuries cost some low- and middle-income countries as much as 5% their gross national product.\nOn a personal level, injuries often create a spiral of poverty. They can leave people unable to work or care for themselves, draining family budgets and hopes for prosperity. Like other serious health issues, the poorest and most vulnerable are at greatest risk and the most affected by road traffic injuries.\nManaging speed\nEvery two years, United Nations Global Road Safety Week presents an opportunity to reflect on the magnitude of road traffic injuries and the urgent need to scale up action to prevent road crashes. The theme for 2017 United Nations Global Road Safety Week, to be held from 8-14 May, is managing speed to keep roads safe for pedestrians and other road users.\nIncreasingly crowded roadways make it even more imperative for people to slow down. The faster you drive, the higher the risk of a crash and the more severe the injuries that may occur.\nFor example, an adult pedestrian hit by a car travelling at 50 kilometres per hour will be seriously injured but most likely survive; whereas, that same pedestrian hit by the same car travelling at 80 kilometres per hour will likely suffer severe injuries and quite possibly die.\nReducing average travelling speeds by just 5% could reduce fatal road crashes by 30%, according to studies.\n''If every vehicle on every road slowed down even a little, there would be fewer crashes \u2013 and certainly fewer serious injuries and deaths,'' notes Dr Shin.\nManaging speed is more than setting speed limits; it requires conscientious law enforcement and the integration of speed management and monitoring in the design of roads and vehicles. Speed limits can be adjusted on roads according to road conditions, the quantity and types of vehicles, and pedestrian traffic.\nThe first step, road safety experts agree, is raising awareness on the dangers of speed.\nTowards zero\n\u201cI have heard people say that death and injury on the road are an inevitable consequence of transport, motorization, and rapid economic development \u2013 and therefore that nothing can be done,\u201d says Dr Shin. ''This is wrong.''\nRoad traffic injuries and deaths are not \u201caccidents\u201d because they can be prevented.\nUnder the safe systems approach to road safety recommended by WHO, zero is the only acceptable number of road deaths, Dr Shin stresses. ''A country's economic growth must be reflected in safer roads for its citizens \u2014 not and acceptance of danger.\u201d\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for a 50% reduction in road traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2020. There is an urgent need to expand and accelerate the implementation of tried and tested policies to improve road safety in order to meet these ambitious but achievable development targets.\nHowever, the pace of change has been too slow. Between 2010 and 2013, road traffic mortality rates in the region dropped by just 4%.\n\"This Road Safety Week, let us turn tragedy to opportunity,'' concludes Dr Shin. ''The opportunity to save so many lives.\""

Bogot\u00e1, Colombia reported zero fatalities in the first six months after installing speed humps and enforcing limits, while other winners such as Addis Ababa, Bengaluru, Buenos Aires, Guadalajara, Kampala, Mombasa, and Quito achieved significant reductions in injuries and deaths through speed humps, enforcement cameras, and policy changes. The initiative, backed by WHO guidelines, underscores that a 5% speed reduction can cut fatal crashes by 30% and aims to inspire global adoption of safe\u2011speed practices.",
