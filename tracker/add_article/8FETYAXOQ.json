      "summary": "The article highlights the critical health challenges faced by Latino communities in the U.S., emphasizing high uninsured rates, costly healthcare access, and significant disparities in chronic disease prevalence. It underscores how low income, occupational hazards, and environmental pollution—particularly fine particulate matter near industrial and transportation hubs—exacerbate health risks, especially for children and pregnant women. The piece calls for policy actions such as Medicaid expansion, zero‑emission transportation, and urban green space initiatives to mitigate these inequities and protect Latino health and economic contributions.",
