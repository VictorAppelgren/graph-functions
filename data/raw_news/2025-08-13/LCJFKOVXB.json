  "content": "CHENNAI, India, Aug. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aeronero, a pioneering deep-tech innovation company revolutionizing the future of water through science-led technology, has secured USD 1.5 million in its first-ever funding round. The raise was led by Callapina Capital and co-invested by Rezwan Razack, MD of Prestige Properties (Razack Family Trust), SAN ANGELS, Jamwant Ventures, and marquee HNIs including Kiran Deshpande (Former CEO, Tech Mahindra) and S. Ramadorai (Former CEO & Vice Chairman, TCS).\n\nThis capital injection marks a significant inflection point for the Chennai-headquartered startup, which has developed a suite of Air Water solutions that generate clean, alkaline, drinkable water directly from the atmosphere. Aeronero's flagship systems are already deployed across homes, offices, and military outposts in India and abroad, addressing severe water scarcity in regions where traditional sources are failing.\n\nAt the heart of the company\u2019s mission is its guiding principle: Water for All, Always. The company\u2019s Founder & CEO, Dr. Durga Das\u2014a former professional athlete recently honored with a Doctorate in Technology and Innovation\u2014shared, \u201cThis funding marks a pivotal moment for us. Water scarcity is not just a crisis\u2014it\u2019s a call to reimagine the systems that sustain life. With the right science, scale, and partners, we\u2019re not just building machines\u2014we're building a global movement toward water independence.\u201d\n\nBacked by 13 global patents (many already commercialized) and a robust research-driven platform, Aeronero has achieved 400% YoY growth in the past year. The company currently holds an order book of nearly \u20b930 crore and is rapidly scaling its in-house manufacturing capacity to produce 2,000 units per month, with a \u20b9100 crore topline in its sights.\n\nVinod Jose, General Partner at Callapina Capital, noted, \u201cAfter tracking Air Water generation for three years, we believe this is the most disruptive innovation the water sector has seen in a century. Aeronero\u2019s decentralized, patent-backed model and visionary leadership position them to lead the global AWG market. They\u2019re answering a fundamental question: Can we source water without extracting it from overburdened natural ecosystems? The answer is yes\u2014and it\u2019s in the air.\u201d\n\nPrestige Group, one of India\u2019s leading real estate developers, sees the collaboration as a critical step toward sustainable infrastructure integration. Rezwan Razack, MD of Prestige Properties (Razack Family Trust), remarked, \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged deeply with Aeronero and are excited by the promise their innovations offer. Our investment reflects our confidence in Durga\u2019s vision and Aeronero\u2019s potential to reshape water sustainability across the communities we serve.\u201d\n\nThe startup has also gained endorsements from leading industry figures. Kiran Deshpande shared, \u201cWe are proud users of Aeronero\u2019s \u2018Bubble\u2019 system. The water is pure, alkaline, and ideal for drinking. Durga and her team are doing phenomenal work in creating sustainable, decentralized water systems.\u201d\n\nEchoing this sentiment, S. Ramadorai added, \u201cAeronero is visionary and scientific in equal measure\u2014creating drinkable water from thin air. Their platform is not only efficient but smart and internet-enabled. It\u2019s a scalable solution to one of humanity\u2019s oldest challenges.\u201d\n\nJamwant Ventures, another investor in this round, emphasized the strategic significance of Aeronero\u2019s work in national resilience. \u201cOur investment in Aeronero aligns with our belief in Atma Nirbhar Bharat\u2014backing innovations that strengthen India\u2019s defense and sustainability infrastructure,\u201d the firm stated.\n\nAs climate change and urbanization continue to place immense stress on traditional water infrastructure, Aeronero is stepping into a leadership role in redefining how the world sources its most critical resource. Its fully Made-in-India solutions span from smart household units to large-scale industrial systems, all engineered for decentralized deployment.\n\nWith its latest funding and a growing coalition of strategic backers, Aeronero is poised to lead a water-secure future\u2014one where clean, safe drinking water flows not from a pipe, but from the air itself.\n\nDisclaimer: This content is provided by AeroNero.
