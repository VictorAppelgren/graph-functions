  "description": "The CEO of the California High-Speed Rail Authority said, \"The U.S. cannot just fail on high speed rail.\"",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe leader of the largest high-speed rail project in the U.S. has said the project will continue despite the Trump administration's withdrawal of funding.\n\nIan Choudri, the CEO of the California High-Speed Rail Authority, said the U.S. \"cannot just fail\" in trying to use the technology, adding that he would continue to ensure the project remained on track.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the California High-Speed Rail Authority for more information via email.\n\nYears of delays and an inflated budget have damaged public and political faith in California's high-speed rail project, but the past few years have seen progress, with construction happening throughout the state and tracklaying set to begin later this year. Proponents of the project say that to call if off now, as many of its detractors in the White House desire, would waste years of advancement.\n\nThat has not stopped President Donald Trump, a long-standing critic of the project, from regularly threatening to take away the federal funding that has been vital to the project's progress\u2014a threat he and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy carried out in July.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nIn an interview with the Central Valley Daily podcast, Choudri said, \"The U.S. cannot just fail on high-speed rail.\" He added that any large construction project on this scale would take a long period of investment to bear fruit.\n\n\"That was not done in one year or two years or 10 years,\" he said, referring to the construction of large-scale projects such as the Big Dig and the interstate highway grid.\n\nIt \"took generations, two or three sometimes,\" Choudri said, adding that the California high-speed rail project needed \"national commitment.\"\n\n\"The issues and challenges \u2026 were not about how we can build bridges or tunnels or embankments or civil infrastructure, which we have been doing in this country for 300 years,\" he said, adding that he \"came to realize the challenges were outside of that.\"\n\n\"The [Newsom] administration and the legislature and the folks that I talk to, we would love to have also the federal government commit the same way. Yes, there will be criticism but \u2026 the healthiest thing to do is just talk about, 'Hey, what works and what doesn't?' And my job is to go fix that,\" Choudri said.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration officially revoked a $4 billion federal grant, branding the project a \"boondoggle\" and arguing that it failed to deliver on promises.\n\nShortly after, Governor Gavin Newsom proposed extending the state's cap-and-trade program, which generates about $1 billion annually for the rail, by 15 years to 2045 to ensure funding for the project's immediate future.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nIan Choudri, the CEO of the California High-Speed Rail Authority, previously said in response to the Trump administration's revocation: \"Canceling these grants without cause isn't just wrong\u2014it's illegal. These are legally binding agreements, and the Authority has met every obligation, as confirmed by repeated federal reviews, as recently as February 2025.\n\n\"America's only high-speed rail project underway is fast approaching the tracklaying phase, with 171 miles under active construction and design, 15,500 jobs created, and more than 50 major structures completed. This is no time for Washington to walk away on America's transportation future.\"\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe California High-Speed Rail Authority is expected to submit an updated business plan and comprehensive funding strategy to lawmakers in 2026.",

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nCalifornia Republicans have written to President Donald Trump to investigate their state's high-speed rail system.\nThe project, which is the largest of its kind in the U.S., was branded a \"colossal failure\" by Republicans.\nNewsweek contacted the California High-Speed Rail Authority for a response to the letter.\nWhy It Matters\nDespite recent construction progress, California's high-speed rail project has suffered from several delays and a ballooning budget. President Trump has already been critical of the project, calling it a \"waste\" and a \"green disaster.\" The letter could be the final tipping point in his new administration taking action.\nWhat to Know\n18 Republican lawmakers from California have formally expressed support for President Donald Trump's recent decision to investigate the project.\nIn a letter, sent on February 13, the state legislators, emphasized the necessity of scrutinizing the project's feasibility and holding the California High-Speed Rail Authority (HSRA) accountable.\n\"Promised to be completed by 2020 with a price tag of $34 billion, HSRA's projected budget ballooned to over $128 billion,\" the letter reads.\n\"Voters were told that more than 20 percent of the project would be privately funded. Instead, taxpayers face the reality of single-handedly funding massively inflated costs for a project that many will never use or see completed.\n\"The HSRA has spent $13.7 billion in total, including $1.6 billion on professional marketing materials and consultants. The only partially completed segment so far connects a field and an orchard and has cost $1.4 billion for 22 miles of raised dirt; along with 11 overpass structures. Zero feet of track have been laid to date.\n\"By all metrics, the High-Speed Rail is a colossal failure.\"\nThis correspondence follows a critical report issued earlier this month by the project's Inspector General, which highlighted significant delays in the construction of the rail segment between Merced and Bakersfield, casting doubt on the project's ability to meet its 2033 completion target.\nFurthermore, the report noted that the HSRA had not conducted a comprehensive risk analysis to assess whether its plans for this segment were \"realistic and achievable.\"\nIn response to the letter, a spokesperson for the California High-Speed Rail Authority told Newsweek: \"To date, 171 miles of the high-speed rail project are under design and active construction, more than 14,600 high-quality jobs have been created, and more than 880 small businesses are engaged on the project.\n\"Of approximately $13 billion spent on the project, $10.5 billion have been funded exclusively by the State of California (not \"hundreds of billions\") and those expenditures have created over $22 billion in economic impact, largely in California's Central Valley communities.\n\"The majority of the approximately 500-mile system from San Francisco to Los Angeles is fully environmentally cleared and stand shovel-ready for future phases of investment to complete a high-speed rail system that embodies the very best of what California represents \u2013 a willingness to dream big, to take on challenges, and to lead the way for the rest of the nation and the world.\n\"Every dollar of the project is accounted for and has been thoroughly reviewed by the independent Office of the Inspector General (OIG). The OIG's sole focus is improving oversight and accountability of the California high-speed rail project by conducting independent, objective reviews and investigations of the High-Speed Rail Authority's planning, delivery, and operation.\"\nWhat People Are Saying\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, at a Kern County launch event in January: \"No state in America is closer to launching high-speed rail than California\u2014and today, we just took a massive step forward. We're moving into the track-laying phase, completing structures for key segments, and laying the groundwork for a high-speed rail network.\"\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters: \"One of the things I want to investigate rapidly, because I've never seen anything to this extent, is the train that's being built between Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\"It is the worst managed project I think I've ever seen and I've seen some of the worst. Billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars over budget.\n\"I read that you can take every single person that was going to go on the train and get the finest limousine service in the world, take them back and forth and you would have hundreds of billions of dollars leftover.\n\"It is the worst thing and we are going to start an investigation because it's not possible. I've built for a living and I build on time and on budget. It's impossible that something could cost that much.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nIn 2025, the California High-Speed Rail Authority is planning to begin construction on stations in the Central Valley. The first high-speed rail services in California are expected to start after 2030, with the full route aiming to be operational by 2050.\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

Inconsistencies may occur.\nPresident Donald Trump has revoked $4 billion in federal funding from California's high-speed rail program, throwing the future of the largest infrastructure project in the U.S. into uncertainty.\nTrump, who has been threatening to withdraw the funding since the beginning of his second term, made the announcement on Wednesday, branding the project a \"boondoggle\" that had been mismanaged by Democratic leaders in California.\nThe Context\nCalifornia's high-speed rail is in an awkward position. Years of delays and an inflated budget have damaged public and political faith in the project, but the past few years have seen progress\u2014with construction happening throughout the state and tracklaying set to start later this year. To call off the project now, as many of its detractors in the White House desire, would waste years of advancement.\nThat has not stopped Trump, a long-standing critic of the project, from regularly threatening to take away the federal funding that has been vital to the project's progress so far\u2014a threat he and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy carried out on Wednesday.\nWhat To Know\nIn a statement on July 16, Trump said he would be \"freeing\" taxpayers from having to give money to support the project.\nAt the same time, Duffy confirmed that $4 billion of federal funds had been revoked, saying the government had already spent $15 billion over a 16-year period.\n\"To the Law abiding, Tax paying, Hardworking Citizens of the United States of America, I am thrilled to announce that I have officially freed you from funding California's disastrously overpriced, 'HIGH SPEED TRAIN TO NOWHERE,'\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\nHe continued: \"This boondoggle, led by the incompetent Governor of California, Gavin Newscum, has cost Taxpayers Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, and we have received NOTHING in return except Cost Overruns. The Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will.\n\"This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED. Thanks to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, not a SINGLE penny in Federal Dollars will go towards this Newscum SCAM ever again. This was an ill-conceived and unnecessary project, and a total waste of Taxpayer money\u2014But no more!\"\nDespite federal opposition, California's leadership has remained fiercely defensive of the project.\nIn May, when Trump first threatened to withdraw funding, Governor Gavin Newsom said doing so would be \"reckless\" and would \"cede a generational infrastructure advantage to China.\"\nShortly after these threats, Ian Choudri, the CEO of the California High-Speed Rail Authority, said the project was open to private sector interests that could serve as a parachute if funding fell through.\nWhat People Are Saying\nIn a statement to Newsweek, California Governor Gavin Newsom said: \"Trump wants to hand China the future and abandon the Central Valley. We won't let him. With projects like the Texas high-speed rail failing to take off, we are miles ahead of others. We're now in the track-laying phase and building America's only high-speed rail. California is putting all options on the table to fight this illegal action.\"\nCalifornia High-Speed Rail Authority CEO Ian Choudri told Newsweek: \"Canceling these grants without cause isn't just wrong\u2014it's illegal.

Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe largest high-speed rail project in the country has released new images of its progress on infrastructure in Central Valley in California.\nThe California High-Speed Rail Authority said that work had finished on the 55th infrastructure project needed for phase one of the rail network, which is set to begin laying track this year.\nWhy It Matters\nWhile the California high-speed rail project continues to make progress throughout the Central Valley, it is increasingly drawing the ire of the federal government.\nPresident Donald Trump has been a longtime critic of the project, branding it a \"waste\" and a \"green disaster.\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has echoed similar skepticism over the cost and timeline of the project, both of which have ballooned beyond original estimates.\nWhat To Know\nDespite the opposition, the authority is pressing forward with dozens of construction efforts in the Central Valley, revealing new images of completed work in Tulare County on Monday.\nThe pictures show the finished Avenue 56 grade separation, which raises traffic above the track route using a 219 feet long, 35 feet wide bridge.\nLast week, the California High-Speed Rail Authority announced the completion of 53 structures and almost 70 miles of guideway between Merced and Bakersfield. Since then, two new structures have been completed, with 29 more underway.\nThe finished structures include the 4,741-foot San Joaquin River Viaduct in Fresno and the Hanford Viaduct in Kings County, which the authority described as the largest structure in the Central Valley for high-speed rail.\nThe progress comes as the authority wrestles with federal authorities for funding. This week, the Federal Railway Administration published a report that put the project \"on notice\" to properly deliver rail network in an appropriate time.\nThe report, published on June 5, said that the project was still $7 billion short, and that there was \"no credible strategy in place to secure additional funds.\"\nHowever, the authority said in a response that the report was \"inaccurate\" and \"often outright-misleading,\" pointing to the completed structures in the Central Valley as evidence of progress.\nWhat People Are Saying\nGarth Fernandez, the authority's Central Valley regional director, said in a statement seen by Newsweek: \"To ensure the surrounding communities were safe and had access to vacate if needed during the heavy rains in 2023, the authority and our contractor worked cooperatively with local agencies and emergency services.\n\"We are delivering the nation's first high-speed rail system and there are opportunities during construction to also help address the needs of the local community.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nThe rail project is entering the tracklaying phase this year, with much of its Central Valley infrastructure already completed.\nAbout the writer\nTheo Burman is a Newsweek Live News Reporter based in London, U.K. He writes about U.S. politics and international news, ...
