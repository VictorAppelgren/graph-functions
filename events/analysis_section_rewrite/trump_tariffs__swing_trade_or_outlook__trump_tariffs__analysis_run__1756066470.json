      "feedback": "The draft mostly adheres to the Movers/Scenarios requirement but it fails in formatting discipline, scope, and sourcing discipline, which weakens world-class quality. Actionable edits: (1) Restrict Movers & Scenarios to exactly 4 lines, with 2 Up and 2 Down, each line strictly as: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %. Remove the stray “Long” and any GM/Alt-Scenario content from the mover block; keep Ford-centric causality anchored in Regime A (tariff‑driven inflation → higher discount rates → wider risk premia → valuation/earnings dynamics for autos). (2) Ground every probability in material evidence or clearly state a qualitative weight tied to explicit anchors; attach in-line IDs after facts that justify the numbers (e.g., Ford’s ~5% yield, forward P/E 8–10x, EV losses ~$1.3B in Q2, 4.3% margin, ROIC ~10% with sources 65UUBU0OR, CGLLF2OES, W2622L6WW, IGP1Q4ZEJ). Do not assign a numeric probability without a source. (3) For each line, ensure the Driver/Mechanism cites first-principles causal chain and stays Ford-focused; avoid including unrelated equities or cross-asset frames unless you explicitly tie them to Ford’s risk/return path. (4) The Trade/Outlook Plan must be 1–2 lines and, since Ford is tradable, present a Swing Trade line(s) in the required fields (Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence). The current draft should be rewritten to two crisp lines (e.g., Up | 1–3 months | Entry near X; Stop Y; Target Z; R/R ~2x; Invalidation: Regime shift to B/C or EV-margin deterioration; Trigger: tariff clarity and Ford EV-margin stabilization; Probability 60–75%; Confidence ~70). (5) Tighten scope by eliminating GM/Alt 1/Alt 2 content or recast them as cross-checks only if Ford-centric, and reconcile any conflicts between regime-level claims (Regime A vs potential Regime B/C) with explicit invalidation gates. (6) Align the narrative so the base/bull/bear structure is testable via explicit catalysts (tariff trajectory, EV-margin inflection, cash flow stability) and map each catalyst to a concrete, observable trigger. (7) Ensure every factual claim with numbers uses a source ID; if a figure comes from multiple sources, cite all relevant IDs and resolve any conflicting points through reconciliation in the commentary, not in the lines themselves. (8) After these edits, the four mover lines will be clean, the Swing Trade plan will be precise and actionable, and the overall piece will satisfy the horizon/style constraints, citation discipline, and first-principles logic the prompt demands.",
