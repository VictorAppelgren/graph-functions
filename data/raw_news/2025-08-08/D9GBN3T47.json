  "title": "How to beat Bo Magus in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers",
  "description": "An optional yet challenging feather dance",
  "content": "Bo Magus is one of the many challenging optional boss fights you can stumble into in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. The quest line of the storyteller ties itself to her defeat. If you\u2019ve been following her story in dialogue throughout your playthrough, her defeat can grant you the secret early ending, \u201cThe Successor of the Bo.\"\n\nNo matter your reason for fighting her, this late-game boss does not pull any punches. However, if you\u2019ve beaten Commander Honglan before her, you already have all the skills to beat Bo Magus. Along with the potential secret ending, Bo Magus drops Echo of the Bo Magus, a new spell, and the Magus\u2019 Earpiece, which you trade in for her outfit.\n\nOur Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Bo Magus boss fight guide will walk you through how to prepare for the fight, where to find her, and how to deal with both her phases.\n\nWhere to find Bo Magus in Wuchang\n\nYou can find Bo Magus near the Palace Entrance Shrine (Worship\u2019s Rise in Ruins). Right next to the shrine, to the left, is a cave with a linear path leading downward. Following it to the bottom will lead you to Bo Magus. Once you step into the arena, there is no cutscene, so be ready to fight.\n\nHow to prepare for Bo Magus\n\nAt this point in the game, you will likely be at a high level. A good rule of thumb is to aim for a level around 80, but if you're struggling, push for level 85. If you\u2019re an item hoarder, you\u2019ll be in a great spot because healing items are super useful in this fight. Items like Steamed Bunny Buns that healing over time are particularly effective.\n\nOn your way to Bo Magus, you will have fought many spell-casting enemies. Bo Magus is no different, so it\u2019s good to have gear that increases your resistance to Feathering and elemental damage as a whole. One way to do this is by equipping the Ghost Warrior set. This set not only offers good defense but also increases resistance against Feathering and Corruption. You can find this armor by looting Ghost Warriors in the Avian Marsh area or buy it from Wu Gang after you give him the Bronze Armor, also found in Avian Marsh.\n\nBo Magus is extremely weak to Blunt damage. If you\u2019re not married to your build, then you can respec your stats to better suit a heavy weapon build such as Strength and Vitality. While strength builds are probably the best for this fight, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible with other builds. Magic and Agility-focused builds are also good in their own way and we beat her with a longsword even though it is not optimal in the slightest.\n\nHow to beat Bo Magus (phase one)\n\nThe first phase of the Bo Magus\u2019 boss fight is a combination of melee and magical attacks, depending on how far you are from her. At the start of the battle, she has a brief exchange of dialogue as she gracefully descends to the ground. This introduction is a window to deal as much damage to her as you can. She will not become aggressive until after she\u2019s finished speaking, so you must get as much damage as you can in before she does. Especially since dealing damage to her isn\u2019t quite as simple in her first phase. Bo Magus likes to teleport.\n\nShe can teleport after taking a certain amount of damage or at random intervals. She always teleports away so she can cast magic at you from you. Positioning and Stamina management are essential here, because if you\u2019re able to close the gap on her quickly after a teleport, you can squeeze a hit in. As for her attacks, they are all straightforward in how you dodge them, as you\u2019ll primarily need to dodge backwards or through them. However, the difficulty comes from how well you manage your Stamina. What's going to kill you most in this fight is running out of Stamina from sprinting too much and then not having the Stamina to dodge.\n\nAt about 50% health, Bo Magus will start her second phase. You'll know it has started because she manifests a crimson shield around her. While this shield is active, she is immune to damage and stagger. The only way to destroy the shield is to hit it, but there\u2019s no visible health bar to let you know you\u2019re close to getting rid of it. The best way to deal with it is to use rapid attacks, which completely goes against her weakness to Blunt damage. Fast weapons like the dual blades will be good in this phase of the fight, and every other build just has to be patient. It doesn\u2019t help that while this shield is active, she becomes much more aggressive.\n\nWhen she starts unleashing a flurry of spear attacks, do not try to trade damage. She is invulnerable behind her shield, and her damage is high enough that even high vitality builds can only take three-to-five strikes. Keep your distance and wait until she pauses in between her flurries. That is your window to get a few hits in. Once you destroy the shield, she will be stunned, allowing you to wail on her with your most powerful attacks.\n\nOutside the shield, most of Bo\u2019s attacks are the same. Prioritizing Stamina will be just as helpful in this phase as it was in the first phase. The only significant difference is her new ultimate attack. In this phase, she teleports just as much, but she will sometimes fly around, spamming magic along the way. It\u2019s much easier to keep up with her when she\u2019s flying, but when she flies high up into the air, know she's charging up her ultimate attack. You can use this time to heal or apply any buffs since the animation for the charge is relatively long. After charging, a giant golden sword will materialize before plummeting to the ground.\n\nUpon contact, it will pulse a few times before exploding with one final burst of energy. This explosion of energy is enough to take out most characters in one hit. You can avoid this attack by sprinting far away from her and waiting it out; however, the trade-off is that you can\u2019t punish her as she returns to the ground. You can perfect dodge through this attack\u2019s pulses, but failure will spell certain death.\n\nSimilar to most Soulslikes, boss fights require patience and persistence. As you continue to play, you\u2019ll build muscle memory and be able to recognize the audio cues and vocal tells that indicate the attack Bo Magus will do next. As long as you know your openings to be aggressive and manage your Stamina properly, Bo Magus is sure to fall.",

      "text": "Commander Honglan is the moment that Wuchang: Fallen Feathers stops holding back and demands that you display what you've learned so far in your playthrough. Unlike other difficulty spikes in Wuchang, this boss is mandatory; you must defeat her before seeing everything else the title has to offer. Overcoming this brutal fight rewards you with the Wei - Combo Force benediction for the Wisdom Slot. This drop grants a damage boost from consecutive attacks. The fight also rewards you with the Reverant Temple Key, a key item needed to progress to the next major location.\nOur Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Commander Honglan boss fight guide will walk you through how to prepare for the fight, where to find her, and help you deal with both phases.\nWhere to find Commander Honglan in Wuchang\nYou can find Commander Honglan in the Palace Hill (Worship's Rise) shrine. Once you make your way to the Palace Hill shrine, at the end of the path to the left of the shrine, you will find the Buddha Statue you need to drain the lotus pond and make the boss arena accessible. Once acquired, you take the Buddha Statue to the stone structure to the right of the shrine, triggering a cutscene displaying the boss arena.\nHow to prepare for Commander Honglan\nLuckily, Commander Honglan is a human-type enemy. She has no elemental resistance, making any elemental damage viable against her, and she's vulnerable to every status ailment. However, when trying to build and itemize for her fight, we found Fire/Burn to be the best choice. In Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, inflicting Burn causes damage over time and increases damage from all sources.\nBuild for defense and counterattacks\nHonglan's attacks are primarily quick slashes with her sword. The best defense against her armor-wise would be to equip armor that offers strong Slash and Stab protection. A good example of this kind of armor is the Centipede Armor Set that you can purchase from Tao Qing after defeating the Blightweaver Great Centipede.\nFocus on deflecting or be prepared to trade hits\nWhile the boss is doable with any build, we've found the most success when using a Longsword, because of its access to deflect disciplines like Sword Counter, or an Axe, specifically an Axe with the Rampage discipline.\nThe Lashing Whip Longsword found in the Mercury Workshop is a great choice here because it's one of the best weapons available to you at this point in the game, and it's good at close and medium range. If you prefer to go the Axe route, you can make use of the Clash mechanic, allowing you to attack through Honglan's attacks and even launch her. While she is recovering on the ground that is a prime window to get a few hits in.\nHow to beat Commander Honglan (phase one)\nCommander Honglan is a skill check. She's far more challenging than the bosses before her, and she sets the tone for the bosses to come after. So you can expect to die a lot, but remember not to be discouraged. Every death is a learning opportunity and an opportunity for you to make note of what works and what doesn't. Every failure will help build instinct, and before you know it, you'll be dodging and countering without thinking about it.\nIn her first phase, Honglan will use a longsword, and her attacks will mix quick slashes in between martial arts moves. The key to her first phase is learning her patterns and knowing what you can and can't deflect. Most of her sword attacks can be parried, allowing for a quick counterattack, while her melee attacks are a bit trickier. After parrying her attacks, follow up with one heavy attack or two light attacks at most. Do not get greedy. You can also take advantage of her AI in this phase if you have the patience for it. If you stay a bit further away from her, she tends to prioritize a lunge attack that is much easier to parry consistently.\nEven if you don't decide to exploit her AI, patience is the deciding factor as you're going to want to survive the first half of her health bar while maintaining as many healing charges as possible.\nHow to beat Commander Honglan (phase two)\nOnce you deplete about half of her health bar, Honglan switches to a dual blade fighting style, and if you're far away, she will instantly attack with a flurry of ranged slashes. This is how you know Phase 2 has been initiated. She is much faster, and her moves blur into each other, making her a bit unpredictable. She gains an almost entirely new moveset, but if you played your first phase right, you should have the healing to get through it.\nHonglan's second phase requires you to display a mastery of the perfect dodge. With her new moves, you won't be able to parry most of them, so it is best to prioritize dodging and positioning. While you may have plenty of healing, it's important to make sure you don't heal directly in front of her, as her moves are so fast, and an ill-timed heal can send you back to the shrine. Only heal if she's far away or you dodged a big attack that created space between you.\nWhile patience is just as important here, you'll benefit from trying to match her aggression where you can. Stay close to her and circle to your left; you'll avoid her flailing combos. If you're lucky, you can apply a status ailment or a poise break towards the end of her first phase, allowing you to reduce her health bar quickly. If not, then this is a battle of attrition. Stay calm, stay patient, and eventually she will fall."
