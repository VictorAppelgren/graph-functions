      "summary": "President Trump announced federal control over Washington's police department, claiming it was necessary to address crime in the capital. However, city officials argue that his administration's actions, such as staffing vacancies and budget cuts, have hindered local efforts to combat crime. They contend that Trump's portrayal of Washington as a crime-ridden city is exaggerated, noting significant reductions in violent crime achieved by local authorities.",
