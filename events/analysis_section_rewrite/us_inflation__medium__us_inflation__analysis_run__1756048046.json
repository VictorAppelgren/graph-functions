      "feedback": "This draft has solid anchors (debt/path to the One Big Beautiful Bill, the Gruters-RNC shift, Medicaid work rules, Range’s AI-productivity thesis, Pacaso/mogul real‑asset plays, and UAS labor data) but needs a tighter, decision-ready 3–6 month map; upgrade by: 1) articulating a formal 3‑scenario map (base, upside, downside) with explicit triggers and invalidations, e.g., base: policy rolls out as described (Big Beautiful Bill debt add ~2.4T over 10 years; Medicaid work requirements phased in; Range productivity 1–1.5% annual gains); upside: faster Medicaid/entitlement reforms plus stronger AI-productivity uptake boosting GDP and disinflation; downside: debt path surprises with faster rate hikes and tighter financial conditions; invalidate if any of: faster debt escalation or policy rollbacks; 2) embedding timing windows (0–2 weeks policy signaling and messaging cadence; 1–3 months policy implementation milestones; 2–4 months AI-wealth-platform/product signals from Range and Pacaso; 4–6 months MVPs/rollouts in UAS or Medicaid) and tying them to observable data; 3) enriching the macro-punditry with quantified channels: debt trajectory → rate expectations → equity risk premia; AI productivity translates to higher potential growth and disinflation pressure; UAS/industrial capex signals as secular growth/backdrop; 4) quantifying each catalyst with source-supported numbers (e.g., 2.4T debt; 1.8T vacation-home market via Pacaso; 21% YoY growth; 40% of Americans eyeing a vacation home; 22% revenue share from Europe/Mexico; 1,400 UAS jobs nationally in 2025 with $105,912 avg salary; 71% of retirees not working from the CNBC/Benzinga pieces; 50k‑mile+/range for Douglas tires; 36 ft stopping-distance premium vs budget; cite each claim with IDs like (UPV3X2MQ6), (EPJYXB7DX), (FOM34PUWA), (ILYC1M41F), (V8TEZOR8R)); 5) building a clean base-case narrative plus 1–2 alt paths, each with explicit probabilistic flavor and clear risks; 6) listing watch signals (RNC fundraising cadence; Medicaid-implementation milestones; Range/Pacaso/mogul user-adoption and funding activity; UAS-headcount data revisions) and labeling them as signals vs.\n\ntriggers; 7) reconciling conflicts and maintaining balance by noting DNC/RNC framing and counterpoints in the same window (cite EPJYXB7DX’s DNC critique alongside Gruters’ stated aims); 8) tightening the prose so causal links are explicit (policy → debt → rate/inflation expectations → equity flows; productivity uplift as a partial offset) and removing rhetorical flourishes; 9) for format, present a single compact paragraph that explicitly ends with: base case, 1–2 alts, risks, watch-list signals, and confidence, with each assertion tethered to a source ID; 10) avoid overreliance on a single source for macro drivers and ensure coverage of key numbers from the critical sources (EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, FOM34PUWA, ILYC1M41F, V8TEZOR8R). Implementing these edits will yield a world-class, scenario-driven, quantitatively grounded 3–6 month view with transparent catalysts, invalidations, timing, and risk signals.",
