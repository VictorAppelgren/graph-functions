  "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nFloating blue paddles dance on the waves that lap a dock in the Port of Los Angeles, silently converting the power of the sea into usable electricity.\n\nThis innovative installation may hold one of the keys to accelerating a transition away from fossil fuels that scientists say is necessary if the world is to avoid the worst effects of climate change.\n\n\"The project is very simple and easy,\" Inna Braverman, co-founder of Israeli start-up Eco Wave Power, told AFP.\n\nLooking a little like piano keys, the floaters rise and fall with each wave.\n\nThey are connected to hydraulic pistons that push a biodegradable fluid through pipes to a container filled with accumulators, which resemble large red scuba tanks.\n\nWhen the pressure is released, it spins a turbine that generates electrical current.\n\nIf this pilot project convinces the California authorities, Braverman hopes to cover the entire 13-kilometer (eight-mile) breakwater protecting the port with hundreds of floaters that together would produce enough electricity to power 60,000 US homes.\n\nSupporters of the technology say wave energy is an endlessly renewable and always reliable source of power.\n\nUnlike solar power, which produces nothing at night, or wind power, which depends on the weather, the sea is always in motion.\n\nAnd there is a lot of it.\n\nThe waves off the American West Coast could theoretically power 130 million homes\u2014or supply around a third of the electricity used every year in the United States, according to the US Department of Energy.\n\nHowever wave energy remains the poor relation of other, better-known renewables, and has not been successfully commercialized at a large-enough scale.\n\nThe history of the sector is full of company shipwrecks and projects sunk by the brutality of the high seas. Developing devices robust enough to withstand the fury of the waves, while transmitting electricity via underwater cables to the shore, has proven to be an impossible task so far.\n\n\"Ninety-nine percent of competitors chose to install in the middle of the ocean, where it's super expensive, where it's breaking down all the time, so they can't really make projects work,\" Braverman said.\n\nWith her retractable dock-mounted device, the entrepreneur believes she has found the answer.\n\n\"When the waves are too high for the system to handle, the floaters just rise to the upward position until the storm passes, so you have no damage.\"\n\nThe design appeals to Krish Thiagarajan Sharman, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\n\"The Achilles heel of wave energy is in the costs of maintenance and inspection,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"So having a device close to shore, where you can walk on a breakwater and then inspect the device, makes a lot of sense.\"\n\nSharman, who is not affiliated with the project and whose laboratory is testing various wave energy equipment, said projects tend to be suited to smaller-scale demands, like powering remote islands.\n\n\"This eight-mile breakwater, that's not a common thing. It's a rare opportunity, a rare location where such a long wavefront is available for producing power,\" he said.\n\nBraverman's Eco Wave Power is already thinking ahead, having identified dozens more sites in the United States that could be suitable for similar projects.\n\nThe project predates Donald Trump's administration, but even before the political environment in Washington turned against renewables, the company was already looking beyond the US.\n\nIn Israel, up to 100 homes in the port of Jaffa have been powered by waves since December.\n\nBy 2026, 1,000 homes in Porto, Portugal should be online, with installations also planned in Taiwan and India.\n\nBraverman dreams of 20-megawatt projects, a critical capacity needed to offer electricity at rates that can compete with wind power.\n\nAnd, she said, the installations will not harm the local wildlife.\n\n\"There's zero environmental impact. We connect to existent man-made structures, which already disturb the environment.\"\n\nPromises like this resonate in California, where the Energy Commission highlighted in a recent report the potential of wave energy to help the state achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.\n\n\"The amount of energy that we're consuming is only increasing with the age of AI and data centers,\" said Jenny Krusoe, founder of AltaSea, an organization that helped fund the project.\n\n\"So the faster we can move this technology and have it down the coastline, the better for California.\"",

  "summary": "Israeli entrepreneur Inna Braverman has developed a system that converts the power of the sea into usable electricity at the Port of Los Angeles port. The pilot project involves floating floating floaters that rise and fall with each wave, connected to hydraulic pistons and a container filled with accumulators. This energy can be converted into electricity, producing enough electricity to power 60,000 homes. Supporters argue that wave energy is renewable and reliable, as waves off the American West Coast could potentially power 130 million homes or supply around a third of the electricity used every year in the US. However, this technology has not yet been successfully commercialized at a large-scale scale. Bravereman hopes to cover the entire 13-kilometer breakwater protecting the port with hundreds of floaters.",
