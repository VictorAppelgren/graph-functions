      "feedback": "Solid near‑term anchors (Fernand risk, sanctuary‑funding injunction) and a plausible, if unfocused, link to macro/credit channels are in place, but the piece needs a tighter, testable 0–3 week causal chain, explicit catalysts, and disciplined use of the provided sources. Edit to: 1) Build a crisp scenario tree with a base case (Invest AL90 forms into a tropical depression and then Fernand as a tropical storm within 48 hours; potential Bermuda hurricane risk with a northward turn; CSU’s near‑term framing around a slightly above‑average season—eight hurricanes, three majors) and an explicit alternative (AL99 develops slowly; Fernand tracks away from Bermuda; U.S. market impact minimal). Cite directly the formation/track signals from the primary sources (e.g., 0R5LB61YY for Fernand/AL90 formation and Bermuda threat; the NHC/AccuWeather notes in the same window). 2) Tie the transmission channels to concrete near‑term market/decision effects (coastal energy/insurance cost exposures, reinsurance pricing, and potential impacts on consumer credit if disaster risk nudges liquidity or risk premia). State the mechanism plainly (e.g., a Bermuda‑bound hurricane could raise regional energy/insurance costs and influence risk assets; an injunction halts (or reduces) a policy shock in sanctuary jurisdictions, affecting fiscal risk sentiment). 3) Quantify thresholds and monitoring flags (formation probability near 100% for AL90 within 48 hours; 70%–20% for AL99 over 7 days; intensity thresholds that would meaningfully alter risk sentiment—e.g., Fernand reaching hurricane strength or making a close approach to Bermuda; any sustained impact to energy markets or insurance costs). 4) Fix citations to the IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL only (replace stray (11) with explicit IDs such as 0R5LB61YY for Fernand/AL90 and U1KRCQOYR for the sanctuary injunction; avoid non‑ID anchors); avoid mixing in weakly related sources unless you can tie them to a defined 0–3 week signal. 5) Trim non‑critical items (e.g., generic consumer‑finance elaboration) unless you can connect them to near‑term catalysts; keep the forecast tight, with a one‑paragraph “watch list” plus a short “base vs. alternate” risk delta. 6) Reconcile conflicts by noting that DOJ’s sanctuary list and the judge‑based injunction are contemporaneous with, and supplementary to, the Latimes reporting; treat the injunction as the policy channel delivering near‑term stability rather than a systemic shock. Implement these edits to produce a tight, testable 0–3 week narrative: Fernand/AL90 as the hinge event, Bermuda risk as the near‑term catalyst, sanctuary injunction as the policy backdrop, and a structured monitoring grid with explicit thresholds and clear, source‑backed numbers.",
