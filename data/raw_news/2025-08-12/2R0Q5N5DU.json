  "description": "Support your child\u2019s digital habits with Google Family Link \u2014 a free app that manages screen time, app use, and location tracking while encouraging a healthy balance between digital and real life.",
  "content": "Google Family Link is a parental control app developed by Google to help parents guide their children\u2019s online activity in a healthy and balanced way. In contrast to traditional monitoring instruments like blocking or restriction, Family Link is meant to help parents promote healthy digital habits where children are free to learn, explore, and develop in the online environment.\n\nUsing this application, parents can limit the amount of time spent on a screen, accept or reject application installations, receive usage reports, track devices, and go as far as to lock the phone remotely, when it is time to have a break.\n\nTo use Family Link, parents and children both need a Google account. One of the parents needs to create a Google Family and add the other parents so they are both able to set up limitations or agree to add time or install apps. Once the Family is created, you will be able to create the child's account (otherwise you won\u2019t because to have a Google account, one needs to be at least 13, and even more in some countries).\n\nOf course, Google Family Link offers to monitor not only one child, but as many as you have in your family, and all devices linked to their account. Coupled with this connectivity, parents can set device and app permissions, monitor screen time, and gain insight into their child\u2019s activity from their own device.\n\nFamily Link offers a clear and convenient interface, so parents can easily sign in, set limits, and change the settings whenever it is necessary. Being either the parent of a younger child receiving their initial phone or a family looking to provide a supportive environment to their teen by helping them learn and communicate online, Family Link offers parents the means by which to encourage healthy digital habits.\n\nThe first thing that makes Google Family Link one of the best app downloads is that it allows parents to be informed about the digital activities of their children and stay actively involved in their digital lives. Instead of asking yourself how much your child is spending on the internet or what applications they are using, you can have direct information at the palm of your hand. Family Link offers weekly and daily reports on all apps used by your child, the amount of time spent with the device, and the nature of the activities performed. This data can be used to initiate the discussion about healthy behaviors regarding screen time and enable the parents to provide their recommendations, powered by actual data, not guesses. The other significant advantage of Family Link is the level of control offered to parents without compromising the child's trust and independence. You can use the app to limit screen time to a specific number of hours each day. Once the limits are exceeded, the device locks automatically to remind children to have a break, but it also offers a way to ask for more time. These functionalities help strengthen family routines and achieve a healthier balance between online and offline life. You can also establish times of the day when a device should not be used, say at school, when doing homework, at bedtime, or during meals. This way, the digital life of your child doesn\u2019t overtake their real life. In addition to screen time, you can also define app time. For each app, you can choose between always available and set a daily length of use. Of course, parental filters are available, letting you configure YouTube settings (with age rating), web restrictions, and app installation restrictions. Family Link is additionally equipped with location-tracking capabilities. Parents can trace the location of their child in real time, providing them with peace of mind when they are away from home. Be it in school, at the house of a friend, or on an outing, you will be able to know their whereabouts or at least the location of the device. This is a particularly useful feature to arrange pick-ups, to monitor safety, or even to have a chance to talk as children become more independent. The app even offers a notification functionality, where you can configure it to warn you when the child leaves or arrives at a selected place.\n\nWhat Operating Systems Are Compatible with Google Family Link? Google Family Link is mainly focused on Android devices, although it supports parents with iOS, as well. The child device needs to be an Android device for Family Link to operate. It could be a smartphone or tablet, and the parents' app displays every device with the child's account. To be able to access the full range of features within it, the device that the child has to use needs at least Android 7.0 (Nougat), but some capabilities can be available even on slightly older Android versions. Either Android phones or iPhones can be used by the parents to update the settings of their child, access reports, and block access to the device. However, iOS parents need to create a Google Family account, and some functionalities may be missing from the iPhone\u2019s app. This platform's versatility allows Family Link to work well within families with a diverse variety of devices, so you can conveniently and simply keep in touch with your family regardless of which technology your family prefers.\n\nWhat Are the Alternatives to Google Family Link? In case you want to consider other possibilities of controlling and supervising the digital activities of your child, it is also possible to find some Google Family Link alternatives that have advantages of their own. Microsoft Family Safety is one of the most popular options. It offers screen time limits, app monitoring, and location tracking are only some of the similar tools that this app offers. It works perfectly with Windows PCs and the Xbox, and would be a perfect choice among families that have already invested in the Microsoft world. The driving safety report is also an added feature of Microsoft Family Safety for those families that have teen drivers. The other very reputable choice is Qustodio Parental Control. Qustodio provides a wide variety of features like screen time restrictions, web filtering, app controls, and call and text monitoring, all tailored for cross-platform use. Operating on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Kindle, it can cover a multi-device household to its fullest. Although Qustodio offers a free version of its services, most of the advanced tools are included in a subscription plan. This will be a decent option for parents who would like more thorough control and reporting. A newer solution, Kids360, also places an overwhelming emphasis on knowing the location and limiting the time spent with a phone. Besides displaying the current location of your child, Kids360 provides geofencing features that will notify parents once a child enters specific areas such as home or school. Parents can also schedule screen-free time and restrict app usage. Though Kids360 has a basic free level, the premium one will give access to more features such as location history and zone-based notifications.",

      "text": "Microsoft Family Safety is a cloud-based tool for parental control that automatically shares permissions across all devices under the Microsoft user account that has the app installed. It works holistically and is natively integrated into the Microsoft ecosystem, which makes it harder to bypass its limits and features.\nEveryone under the Microsoft Family Safety suite gets weekly emails with usage statistics and can open a dashboard with real-time usage data. As a parent, you can set up per-device permissions and limits, lock screens instantly, or review extension requests sent by your kid. Content filtering on computers and mobile phones pulls from the Windows Defender database and quickly detects malicious domains.\nWith Microsoft Family Safety, you can also set up location tracking so that anyone within your family can check where other members are, get arrival alerts, and check the location history over the last 30 days. There's also a feature that tracks driving behavior and delivers reports that help understand the usual speed, hard braking, or even phone usage over time. Microsoft Family Safety works on Windows PCs, Xbox consoles, Android phones, and iPhones.\nWhy should I download Microsoft Family Safety?\nMicrosoft Family Safety is a great solution for everyone in the Microsoft ecosystem that allows you to control your loved ones' digital habits and physical location. It works across different devices and helps you consistently manage access to devices and configure content filters on Windows, Windows, Xbox, Android, and iOS.\nUsing Microsoft Family Safety, you can define daily limits for specific apps, games, or even entire devices. This helps you block YouTube for your kids after they've been using it for one hour while still allowing them access to more educational options. Your child can also send you extension requests that you'll see as a notification on your phone that you can approve or deny. Microsoft Family Safety also works on Xbox and Windows computers, so you can lock any purchases or get alerts when someone downloads a new app or game.\nBased on the Microsoft Edge engine, Microsoft Family Safety offers content filtering features that you can use to block inappropriate websites, set up safe searches, or even completely restrict web access apart from a defined list of websites. You can use built-in maturity settings that adjust the content filters automatically to your child's age, or configure them manually. When someone attempts to access a blocked site, the parent app gets a notification in real-time along with the web address.\nWith Microsoft Family Safety, you can look up different activity statistics and monitor how much time your kids spend on a given device, app, or website. There's also an option to set up location sharing for all family members who have Microsoft Family Safety installed, where you can always see on the map where everyone is, their routes, and how long they've spent in a given place. You can even define safe zones for your home, the kids' school, or a friend's place and get notified when they enter or leave that area.\nWhat makes Microsoft Family Safety stand out is that, with it, you can also receive reports on how safe you or your loved ones are driving. They list the routes, time spent on the phone while driving, but also such events as speeding or hard braking, which is great when you have teens with a driving license and want to check how they're doing behind the wheel.\nMicrosoft Family Safety comes in a limited free version or a full one if you have a Microsoft 365 subscription. The interface supports tracking and managing multiple devices or profiles for different kids. The app also clearly shows the time remaining in a given app or device so that no one is surprised when they are locked out.\nIs Microsoft Family Safety free?\nYes, the majority of Microsoft Family Safety features are available for free. You can establish screen time limits, app approvals, content filters, and more at no cost. You'd need to purchase the Microsoft 365 Family subscription to unlock features such as location alerts, driving reports, and 30-day location history.\nWhat operating systems are compatible with Microsoft Family Safety?\nMicrosoft Family Safety is a truly cross-platform solution that works natively with the Windows ecosystem and beyond. You can download it on Windows 10 and 11, Xbox One, and Series X/S, as well as iOS (16.0 or later) and Android (9.0 or higher) mobile devices.\nYou can also log in to Microsoft Family Safety through its website to check the activity dashboard. For this service to work, remember to install the Microsoft Family Safety apps on every device you'd like to control, and each person needs to be added to the Microsoft Family Group.\nWhat are the alternatives to Microsoft Family Safety?\nGoogle Family Link is a free alternative from Google that works on Android, iOS (for parents), ChromeOS, and the web. Use it to establish app permissions, screen time limits, location monitoring, and website filters. It's a great option for scheduling bedtimes, getting activity reports, and approving new app downloads.\nQustodio Parental Control is a comprehensive suite of tools to manage screen time, force web filters, control usage statistics, and even check calls and text messages (Android-only feature). With the free app, you have a limited set of features, but the paid option adds additional tools like geofencing or social monitoring, and you can use Qustodio Parental Control on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Kindle.\nKids360 is a primarily mobile app for controlling time spent on a device, app, or website, tracking your kids' location through GPS, and locking access after limits are passed. The app focuses on gamification, and you can also set up tasks for kids so that when they complete them, they gain extra screen time. It is available on iOS and Android."

      "text": "Kids360 offers a wealth of features that help parents and guardians monitor and safeguard their children. Once you connect the parent phone with the child's device, the devices sync every 5 minutes. With the app, you can check the kid's location on a map and their route, and Kids360 will also show you the battery level. You can also set up safe zones for home or school so that you get an alert when your kid leaves or enters that area.\nApart from the offline features, you can also track your kids' online activities, like time spent on each app, how many times a day they use the phone, or usage spikes. Parents can define daily limits per app that will count down when the kids reach the allocated time. Children can request single extensions by sending a notification to the parent's phone, which will also be saved to the app history for tracking.\nWith Kids360, kids get different achievements for making better screen choices, and you can also create schedules where only certain apps are available. Kids360 also includes emergency options that send the location and an audio alert to all linked guardians. You can download the app for free on iOS and Android, though it does offer a premium subscription plan with more options.\nWhy should I download Kids360?\nKids360 is a robust parental control app where you can monitor and manage screen time for your kids while also keeping their data private. The app includes a live GPS tracking module so you can always view your kid's location on a map or check where the child has been and for how long over a specified period. This great feature allows you to track the kids' commute, after-school activities, and weekend trips.\nWith Kids360, you can set daily usage limits with granularity so that you can define, for example, 2 hours of screen time on weekdays and 4 hours over the weekend. As a parent, you can choose between locking out the entire device or just blocking specific apps, so the kid can still call or text if they need something. You can also create limits for particular times so that no social media apps are available during school hours or after bedtime.\nThe restrictions you can apply with Kids360 can also work on a per-app basis, so that you can check the complete list of apps your kid has installed and verify how much time they spend on each of them. If you see some apps that tend to distract your children, you can lock just that single app without blocking the whole phone. You can also check the usage dashboard, which lists detailed stats on device activity. The app lists time spent on the device, top-used apps, hours with the screen turned on, and periods of inactivity. You can visualize all that information on charts to understand the trends, and Kids360 will also send you a notification when the kid installs a new app or goes over their limit. You can also check their YouTube viewing history.\nKids360 also has geo-fencing features where you're able to define safe zones like home, school, and friend's friend's place and get notified when your kid enters or exits a specific area. You can also check your kid's battery level or configure an SOS button so that your kid can quickly alert you when something is happening, and you'll get their detailed location.\nYou protect your access to Kids360 with a PIN or biometric login, which is required to bypass any limits or uninstall Kids360. The app also works great when you have multiple kids to manage, so you can set up profiles for each of them and track them separately.\nFrom the kid's point of view, Kids360 shows them notifications about the remaining time or any upcoming restrictions, so they are aware at all times and won't be surprised when their app is suddenly blocked. It also gamifies the experience, where if you spend time healthier, such as reading a book or walking a dog, you can gain extra time for other apps, like games or social media. There are also built-in development games that can earn them extra phone time.\nIs Kids360 free?\nYou can download Kids360 for free and test the app this way, but you'll only have access to limited features. These include app stats, tasks for kids, the child's location, sending a loud signal, and protection from uninstalling the app. You need a paid subscription to get features like app locks and limits, access schedules, installation bans, and more.\nWhat operating systems are compatible with Kids360?\nKids360 works with most mobile phones, and you can download it from the App Store, Google Play Store, Huawei AppGallery, and Galaxy Store. The app works on Android 7.0 or newer devices and iOS 16.0 or higher.\nYou need to download and install two apps - one on the parent phone and then a dedicated kid\u2019s app on your children's phone in order for Kids360 to work (all links are available here).\nWhat are the alternatives to Kids360?\nGoogle Family Link is an official parental control app for Android devices and Chromebooks. It also has a parent app for iOS. You can integrate it with your Google account and use the app for free to manage app installs, set screen time limits, approve in-app purchases, and track your kid's location.\nMicrosoft Family Safety is another parental control solution for Windows and Android devices and Xbox. You can define web filters, get activity reports, define screen limits, and get location alerts. The app comes in both free and paid versions and can also limit your kid's time in front of a gaming console.\nQustodio Parental Control offers detailed parental supervision tools on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Chromebooks, and even Kindle readers. Use it to control screen time, block certain apps, monitor text messages on Android devices, track social media usage, and apply web filters on your kids' phones. You can use it for free in a limited version on a single device, or get a paid subscription for more features."
