      "feedback": "The analysis draft provides a solid overview of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it could benefit from enhanced depth and specificity. To elevate the analysis to world-class quality, consider the following actionable edits: \n\n1. **Clarify Causal Chains**: Strengthen the causal links between rising Black unemployment and broader economic implications. For example, explicitly connect how federal hiring freezes and tariffs impact specific sectors and demographics, using quantitative data where possible.\n\n2. **Scenario Structure**: Develop a clearer scenario/catalyst map that outlines potential economic and political outcomes over the next 3–6 months. Specify timing windows for expected changes in unemployment rates and Federal Reserve actions, and include alternative scenarios based on different policy responses.\n\n3. **Quantification**: Integrate more specific numbers and ranges from credible sources to support claims about job losses and economic indicators. For instance, detail how many jobs are projected to be lost in specific sectors due to federal policies.\n\n4. **Catalysts and Triggers**: Identify specific catalysts that could trigger changes in the economic landscape, such as upcoming Federal Reserve meetings or key political events related to redistricting. \n\n5. **Citation Density**: Ensure that all claims are backed by citations from the provided source material, and reconcile any conflicting information. For example, clarify how the job growth figures align with the broader economic context.\n\n6. **Watch-list Signals**: Clearly define what signals to monitor in the coming months, such as changes in consumer spending, shifts in Federal Reserve policy, or developments in the political landscape that could impact economic recovery.\n\nBy implementing these edits, the analysis will gain clarity, coherence, and a more robust foundation for predicting future trends.",
