  "content": "The Philadelphia Federation of Teachers has a tentative, three-year contract. The deal was announced by President Arthur Steinberg, shown here in this 2024 file photo. Read more\n\nThe Philadelphia School District and its largest union have a tentative, three-year deal.\n\nThe dramatic news came late Sunday night \u2014 less than 12 hours before the first day of school for 117,000 district students, but a week before the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers\u2019 contract expired.\n\nThe PFT is the district\u2019s largest union, representing 14,000 teachers, school counselors, nurses, secretaries and paraprofessionals.\n\nTerms of the deal were not available, but union leaders were pushing for raises, an end to the controversial \u201c3-5-7-9\u2033 policy that imposed penalties on educators for taking their contractually awarded sick time, and parental leave \u2014 PFT members, under the current contract, get no such leave.\n\nArthur Steinberg, PFT\u2019s president, said in a statement that he was \u201cthrilled\u201d with the tentative pact \u201censuring that school will open on time, as well as three years of labor peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis contract recognizes the hard work and dedication our members bring to the district and allows them to have peace of mind that they will be able to provide for their families while continuing to educate the children of the School District of Philadelphia,\u201d Steinberg said.\n\nSuperintendent Tony B. Watlington Sr. said in a statement the deal acknowledged teachers\u2019 strong efforts \u201cand maintains our record of strong financial stewardship.\u201d\n\nResearch shows that qualified, well-supported and stable teachers are the most important factor in driving student achievement, Watlington said, \u201cand as we begin the new school year, this contract gives us stability, clarity, and momentum to continue working in partnership with the PFT and to further implement our five-year strategic plan, Accelerate Philly. We are on our way to becoming the fastest improving, large urban school district in the nation.\u201d\n\nUnion officials said they would share details of the contract in the near future.\n\nThe tentative deal, still subject to ratification by PFT members, comes after some saber rattling.\n\nSteinberg asked for \u2014 and received \u2014 a strike vote in June, just after the end of the last school year, and had expressed frustration with the pace of talks. Members gathered earlier this month to begin strike preparations, and Steinberg said there was a \u201clack of urgency\u201d on district officials\u2019 part around talks.",

      "text": "Sick days come with their contract. But Philly teachers get punished for taking them.\n10 are allowed each year, but after accumulating a few, instructors are expected to meet with the boss. Then things intensify.\nPhiladelphia teachers\u2019 contract allows them 10 sick days a year. But they are progressively penalized just for taking them.\nThat means when a teacher comes down with a virus or has a family member with a medical emergency, there\u2019s a constant calculus in the heads of many: Can I afford to take the day off? Will there be consequences for doing so?\nThe policy, known informally as \u201c3-5-7-9,\u201d works this way: After a teacher\u2019s third \u201coccurrence,\u201d whether a single sick day or the third in a consecutive stretch of days, principals are instructed to have an informal conversation with the instructor and write a memo documenting the episode. After the fifth occurrence, the teacher gets a warning memo in the permanent file; after the seventh, the teacher gets an \u201cunsatisfactory incident\u201d memo in the file and a formal conference. A teacher who reaches nine occurrences gets a second unsatisfactory incident report, a recommended suspension, and conferences with the principal and assistant superintendent.\n\u00bb READ MORE: Philly teachers may have a one-year contract \u2014 and a big raise \u2014 in a surprise, early settlement\nIt\u2019s a policy that has been around for decades but is now coming under fire as the Philadelphia district faces a national teacher shortage and particularly high levels of educator attrition.\n\u201cThe days were meant for us to take,\u201d said Cristina Gutierrez, a kindergarten teacher at Elkin Elementary in Kensington. \u201cThey are part of our contract, they are our days. To restrict us on how many we can take before being penalized is ridiculous.\u201d\nTeachers plan a rally against the policy before Thursday\u2019s school board meeting.\n\u2018Absolutely, positively hated\u2019\nEarly in Kate Sannicks-Lerner\u2019s career as a teacher at the Philadelphia School District, she worried about racking up occurrences because she was a single parent responsible for taking off when her daughter got sick. The worries continued when she married and her husband became ill with seizures, surgeries, and serious eye problems.\nNow 23 years into teaching in the district, Sannicks-Lerner, who works at Julia de Burgos Elementary in North Philadelphia, is in her last year of worrying about whether she\u2019ll get penalized for taking the time off she earned.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say necessarily that it\u2019s the main reason I\u2019m retiring, but it figures heavily in that,\u201d said Sannicks-Lerner. \u201cThis policy is absolutely, positively hated.\u201d\nShe said it\u2019s unevenly enforced, too. During one of her husband\u2019s illnesses, Sannicks-Lerner received a warning that her next occurrence would result in an unsatisfactory incident memo \u2014 and advice from her principal to apply under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which would allow her to take time off for her husband\u2019s surgeries and medical appointments outside of the 3-5-7-9 policy.\n\u201cBut some principals show favoritism to some people; some people are out and they don\u2019t rack up occurrences,\u201d said Sannicks-Lerner, who recently gave Superintendent Tony B. Watlington Sr. an earful about the policy in a one-on-one with the school chief. (She told Watlington they needed to get rid of the policy, Sannicks-Lerner said, and \u201che said, \u2018I\u2019ve heard a lot about that.\u2019\u201d)\nAccording to anecdotes collected by the Caucus of Working Educators, a group within the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers that is organizing members to speak out against 3-5-7-9, the policy has not let up in the toughest of situations. One teacher had an infant diagnosed with cancer but did not yet qualify for federal family medical leave, another taught while ill with food poisoning after being threatened with discipline if another sick day were used.\nA policy originating 40 years ago\nThe policy stems from a case dating 40 years, when a district secretary was fired for poor attendance. The PFT challenged the termination and ultimately lost; the arbitrator wrote that management can \u201crequire reasonably steady attendance as a condition of employment, regardless of the reasons for the absences, since otherwise the employee is of no practical value to the enterprise.\u201d\nThe PFT contract sets the number of sick days at 10 (plus three personal days), but the arbitration decision gives the district the right to set the 3-5-7-9 policy. The district\u2019s employee relations department tells principals that \u201cprogressive discipline uses increasingly more severe penalties to bring about positive change in employee behavior. The goals of progressive discipline are to improve employee output, correct inappropriate behavior, or terminate recalcitrant employees.\u201d\nPFT president Jerry Jordan said he understood the importance of staff attendance but takes issue with the policy. \u201cIf someone is sick, that\u2019s what the sick days are for. People should not be mistreated or abused by administration for taking that time,\u201d he said.\nWatlington has stressed teacher attendance since he came to Philadelphia \u2014 though the superintendent has said he does not expect people to come to work sick \u2014 and Jordan said that emphasis has resulted in increased scrutiny on consequences for those staff who do take sick days.\n\u201cThere are some overzealous administrators in some buildings, and that\u2019s caused a number of people to be called in about attendance,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cBut people\u2019s health issues are their personal business, and if they\u2019re not there, they\u2019re not there.\u201d\nJordan has said that eliminating 3-5-7-9 is absolutely an issue at the negotiating table; on Wednesday he announced a new, tentative one-year contract extension that would give members a 5% raise but preserve the rest of the current contract, but if members approve the extension, a new deal would need to be hammered out by Aug. 31, 2025.\nWatlington has publicly said the district\u2019s policy could be revised; school board vice president Mallory Fix-Lopez, a former district teacher, has also expressed distaste for it.\n\u201cI find it de-professionalizes the space that teachers work in,\u201d Fix-Lopez said at the December board meeting.\nMonique Braxton, a district spokesperson, said teachers being disciplined for attendance issues is \u201cextremely rare.\u201d She stressed that teachers should not come to work when they\u2019re sick, and said they have the opportunity to purchase wage continuation insurance \u201cfor teachers who need long-term leave beyond their leave balances.\u201d\nOfficials, Braxton said in a statement, \u201cwill review our current processes after this school year to identify areas for improvement as we seek to promote staff attendance and wellness.\u201d\nWhy 3-5-7-9 rankles\n3-5-7-9 takes up a lot of mental energy for Shira Cohen, a math teacher at Feltonville School of Arts and Sciences and the school\u2019s union representative.\n\u201cPeople are so terrified to be disciplined for this thing that we have so little control over,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cWe can\u2019t control when we get sick, we can\u2019t control when our kids get sick, or life happens or some medical issue comes up.\u201d\nThe nature of the policy means that staff sometimes end up taking more, not fewer, days off when they\u2019ve burned a sick day, because they have already triggered one occurrence. Cohen, for instance, used a sick day on a recent Tuesday when she was ill. She still wasn\u2019t feeling great Wednesday, but may have tried to push through and gone to work had 3-5-7-9 not been in place. Because she had already gotten one occurrence, though, she stayed out until she felt all better.\n\u201cDo you want teachers in classrooms, or do you want to abide by this very antiquated, dehumanizing policy?\u201d said Cohen. \u201cIt would be nice to be treated in a more humane way when we\u2019re ill, and when our loved ones are ill.\u201d\nShortly after he started teaching at Building 21, a district high school in West Oak Lane, Julian Prados Franks explained his new employer\u2019s sick time policy to his family. His father, a casino worker, was mystified.\nHe said, \u201c\u2018They do what?\u2019\u201d said Prados Franks, who has not incurred consequences for using his sick time \u2014 yet. \u201cThis policy just demonstrates a fundamental distrust between the district and the teachers; that level of control makes it feel like we\u2019re not adults, like we don\u2019t deserve to be treated with dignity.\u201d\nPrados Franks, Cohen, Sannicks-Lerner and Gutierrez all said they believe the 3-5-7-9 policy feeds into the high Philadelphia teacher attrition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why nobody wants to be a teacher anymore,\u201d said Gutierrez. \u201cIt\u2019s always on your mind \u2014 you don\u2019t want to have a bad relationship with your principal because of absences. But we\u2019re not robots who can go go go.\u201d"
