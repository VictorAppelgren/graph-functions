  "content": "The Most Expensive City for Watering a Lawn Was Just Revealed\u2014And It's Not Where You Think originally appeared on Dengarden.\n\nOnce upon a time a perfectly manicured green lawn was the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of a home. And it still might be in some cases, but with 25% of the U.S. in a drought in 2025, those lawns are becoming more difficult and costly to maintain.\n\nIn my neck of the woods of Southern California, many neighbors have swapped out the traditional green lawn in favor of drought-tolerant landscaping (think lots of succulents and rocks). They're beautiful, but not the type of yard you want to walk through barefoot (ouch). With all of this in mind, a recent study set out to rank the most expensive cities for lawn watering, and the results are really interesting.\n\nSIGN UP for the Dengarden / Parade Home & Garden newsletter for a weekly dose of our favorite house hacks, decor trends and shopping deals\n\nThe study was conducted by Lawn Love, which compared almost 500 cities across the country, looking at affordability of local water bills, average yard sizes, drought risks and grass water requirements, among other things.\n\nSurprising to me is the fact that the entire top 10 of the most expensive cities to water a lawn are filled out by cities in either Arizona or Texas. So it really has very little to do with overall cost of living in these places, but rather rather dry conditions that lend themselves to high water costs.\n\nTake Buckeye, Arizona, for example, which ranked as the number one most expensive city to water a lawn. Here, the portion of a household income spent on water is 0.97%, and historically they only get .6 inches of rain each month.\n\nAnd while California didn't crack the top 10, some Golden State cities do start to enter the picture at number 11. That's where Bakersfield which is located in the San Joaquin Valley and considered a low desert area, breaks onto the list.\n\nThe City Where It's Cheapest To Water a Lawn\n\nIf you want to look at the other side of the picture, Washington, D.C. is the cheapest city to water a lawn. With New York and Boston close behind them. This is largely because yard sizes in these places are much smaller than others. Smaller yard means less water usage to keep it green.\n\nHow to Water Your Lawn Without Breaking the Bank\n\nThere's no clear-cut way on how to keep your lawn green without spending a bundle, but a few tips can help. To keep your lawn happy without wasting water, aim for a deep soak once or twice a week instead of a daily sprinkle\u2014this encourages strong roots. Water early in the morning so less evaporates in the heat. Adjust your sprinkler to hit grass, not sidewalks, and consider a rain gauge to avoid overwatering. If it rains, skip your watering day. You\u2019ll save water, lower your bill and still have a lawn that looks fresh and green.\n\nThe Most Expensive City for Watering a Lawn Was Just Revealed\u2014And It's Not Where You Think first appeared on Dengarden on Aug 11, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by Dengarden on Aug 11, 2025, where it first appeared.",

      "text": "Which cities will have residents paying the price for watering their lawns?\nWith water bills rising and droughts becoming more frequent, Lawn Love ranked 2025\u2019s Most Expensive Cities for Watering Your Lawn.\nWe looked at nearly 500 of the largest U.S. cities, comparing affordability of local water bills, average yard sizes, drought risks, grass water requirements, and 6 other key metrics.\nSome watering stats to know:\n\ud83d\udca747% of ranked cities receive less than 3 inches of rain per month, well under the 4 to 6 inches most lawn grasses need monthly.\n\ud83d\udcb0 6 cities in our ranking spend over 1% of household income on water, 3 in Texas.\n\ud83c\udf27\ufe0f 26 cities see over 5 inches of monthly rain; 80% are in Florida.\n\ud83c\udf3f 87% of cities with 300 or more days in the growing season are in Florida or California (127 out of 146).\nDive into our ranking below. To learn how we ranked the cities, see our methodology.\nContents\n- City rankings\n- Top 5 most expensive cities for watering the lawn\n- Key insights\n- Expert take\n- Behind the ranking\n- Water wisely\nCity rankings\nSee how each city fared in our ranking:\nTop 5 most expensive cities for watering the lawn\nCheck out the slideshow below for highlights on each of our 5 most expensive cities. In Arizona, dry conditions and high water costs have led many homeowners to embrace xeriscaping, which uses drought-tolerant plants, rocks, and little to no grass. You\u2019ll spot an example in the photos.\nKey insights\nArizona dominates the top of the ranking, locking in 12 of the 15 priciest spots for lawn watering, including Buckeye (No. 1), Yuma (No. 4), and Tucson (No. 5), while California soaks up 51% of the top 100 with Bakersfield (No. 11) and Visalia (No. 17) leading the Golden State.\n- At least 2 Arizona cities are looking to offset drought-driven supply costs with 2025 rate hikes. Goodyear (No. 2) approved water utility fee increases in May 2025, effective July 1, 2025, while Phoenix\u2019s (No. 13) third rate hike (13%) since 2023 became effective in May.\n- Triple-digit heat, scarce rain, and warm-season grass varieties drive up costs. Texas, Nevada, and New Mexico cities trail close behind Arizona and California as Colorado River supplies tighten.\n- Brownsville, Texas (No.3), bears the heaviest load, with households spending 1.09% of income on water under Stage 2 drought rules. Texas lands 20 cities in the top 100, from Mission (No. 7) to San Antonio (No. 80). Santa Fe, New Mexico (No. 29), and the Las Vegas trio, North Las Vegas (No. 85), Henderson (No. 89), and Las Vegas (No. 94) join the surge.\nResidents living in cooler, wetter corners of the Midwest and Northeast are seeing green: green grass in their yards and green in their wallets. Cities across states like Ohio, Massachusetts, New York, and Michigan, including Akron, Ohio (No. 491), Boston (No. 496), Syracuse (No. 466), and Ann Arbor, Michigan (No. 442) finish in the bottom 100, thanks to frequent rain, milder summers, and lower grass watering requirements.\n- Every Utah city in the ranking, from Lehi (No. 270) to West Valley City (No. 457) landed in the bargain half of the ranking, even as 100% of the state is experiencing moderate to severe drought and reservoir storage slid 10% from June 1 to July 1.\n- The Pacific Northwest\u2019s \u201crain discount\u201d is under threat. While 17 of the 28 PNW cities in our ranking landed in the cheaper half, including Seattle (No. 422), Beaverton, Oregon (No. 394), and Boise City, Idaho (No. 200), Washington expanded its drought emergency on June 5, and Oregon added more counties after record-low stream flows.\nSplash through more local insights below.\nExpert take\nRecord heat, shrinking reservoirs, and soaring energy prices have sent U.S. water bills to new highs in 2025, forcing many cities to tighten lawn watering rules or ban non-essential turf outright.\nWe asked a panel of experts how homeowners and governments can manage the rising cost of outdoor water use while keeping landscapes sustainable. Read their insights below.\n- How have watering restrictions and bans on grass lawns impacted homeowners?\n- What factors determine the local cost of water to consumers?\n- What are your 5 best tips for minimizing the cost of lawn irrigation?\n- Drip irrigation system vs. sprinkler system: Which is better and why?\n- Climate change, inflation, and high energy costs are driving up Americans\u2019 water bills. What measures can various levels of government take to lower water prices and keep them under control?\n- How much water and expense do drought-tolerant grass types really save homeowners?\nHow have watering restrictions and bans on grass lawns impacted homeowners?\nThey haven\u2019t been able to have the verdantly green and lush lawns that they want. These green lawns can create local cooling and make living environments cleaner and more inviting.\nWhat factors determine the local cost of water to consumers?\nIt depends on where they get their water from. Municipal water pricing is usually on a per-gallon basis. Every municipality prices these slightly differently and the prices are usually based on their costs. This is usually water from garden hoses connected to their home water supplies and is potable water and thus is higher cost due to the higher quality standards.\nSome irrigators have access to a separate supply of water from an irrigation district. This water does not come through the home and thus is not potable, and often doesn\u2019t have incremental pricing (\u2018just don\u2019t use more than a given amount,\u201d for example) and is therefore less expensive.\nWhat are your five best tips for minimizing the cost of lawn irrigation?\n1. The water needs of grass changes drastically throughout the season. Thus, don\u2019t use a set schedule for your lawn that doesn\u2019t change throughout the season. Most home lawn and garden irrigators over-irrigate in the spring, they might under-irrigate during the middle part of the summer, and then over-irrigate again in the fall.\nThe times that they over-irrigate, they are spending more money for water than is necessary and they can leach nutrients (primarily the nitrate form of nitrogen) out of their soil profile and move it towards the groundwater. Estimates of grasswater use (evapotranspiration) are often available for free online depending on your state.\n2. Keep your irrigation system repaired, adjusted, and in good working order. Non-uniform irrigation means that more water must be applied everywhere in order to adequately irrigate the spots that get less water.\n3. Get a good irrigation system designed by someone who knows what they\u2019re doing. You pay the penalty for poor irrigation system designs for the entire life of the irrigation system.\n4. Don\u2019t irrigate every day. Irrigating every day results in a lot of water lost to evaporation from a wet soil and grass surface. It also encourages grass diseases. Figure out how much water your soil can hold, apply that much water all in one irrigation event, and then don\u2019t irrigate again until that water has been used up.\nMost soils can hold about 1 inch of water in the shallower root zone of lawn grass. This can be much less for sandy soils. It takes anywhere from 4 days to 3 weeks to use 1 inch of water, depending on where you live, what time of year it is, and what the weather is like. When making irrigation timer modifications for the changing seasons and weather, change the interval between irrigations instead of the irrigation run times (how much water is applied each time).\n5. Let your grass get slightly water-stressed during the middle of the summer. It will save a lot of water.\nDrip irrigation system vs. sprinkler system: Which is better and why?\nDrip irrigation is significantly more efficient, but it is expensive to set up and maintain. It makes much more sense in beds with perennial bushes with nothing in between and is more difficult in areas where everything needs to be irrigated (like lawns).\nBuried drip irrigation can have issues with plugging, primarily due to unclean water, or root intrusion. Unclean water is most common in non-potable water supplies and root intrusion is most common when deficit irrigating \u2014 roots go looking for water and find it in the drip emitters.\nDrip irrigation can reduce water requirements by 20% to 40% depending on the climate and type of sprinkler irrigation system they are replacing.\nClimate change, inflation, and high energy costs are driving up Americans\u2019 water bills. What measures can various levels of government take to lower water prices and keep them under control?\nMost governments aren\u2019t charging more than their costs for supplying the water at the flow and quality levels that their customers want. Therefore, the only way to significantly modify water costs is for irrigators to lower their water use. High water prices are the biggest motivation for conservation.\nHow much water and expense do drought-tolerant grass types really save homeowners?\nNot much if they are irrigated the same as regular grass varieties. Drought-tolerant grass varieties specialize in being able to survive the water being turned off for long periods of time. They usually survive by going dormant. But this dormant phase makes lawns look brown and dead and homeowners don\u2019t like it, so they keep irrigating them.\nResearch shows that water use can be cut by up to \u00bd by deficit irrigating lawn grasses and they will recover with drought-tolerant varieties recovering much better from these droughts. They look bad though and home-owners aren\u2019t getting out of lawns what they want.\nHow have watering restrictions and bans on grass lawns impacted homeowners?\nWatering restrictions have become a common occurrence across Texas. Historically, watering restrictions were typical primarily during drought periods, but we are seeing more cities and utilities implement permanent year-round watering restrictions \u2014 often limiting landscape irrigation to only 1 day a week or no more than 2 days a week.\nObviously, no one wants to have a dead lawn, so homeowners are becoming more receptive to incorporating water conservation technologies and practices into their landscapes.\nWhat factors determine the local cost of water to consumers?\nTraditionally water costs were based on recuperating the costs to pump, treat, and convey the water.\nHowever, costs are increasing due to a growing population and an aging utility infrastructure. Developing newer water supplies and treatment facilities is expensive depending on the source. Additionally, older pipelines can begin to leak over time, requiring expensive infrastructure upgrade projects.\nIn the absence of state and federal funding, the bulk of these costs are passed down to the consumers.\nWhat are your five best tips for minimizing the cost of lawn irrigation?\n1. Irrigation system maintenance. Check the system regularly for leaks and damaged hardware that can waste water such as sprinklers irrigating streets and sidewalks.\n2. Pressure regulation. Most residential irrigation systems do not require high pressures for operation. Operating sprinklers at pressures higher than recommended by the manufacturer can result in higher evaporation from misting sprinklers as well as wind drift losses. Operating at the correct pressure increases efficiency and reduces the amount of water needed to be applied to maintain a healthy landscape.\n3. Seasonal irrigation scheduling. Water requirements vary throughout the year. Turn off the irrigation system in the winter when most plants are dormant. Spring rains can be more than sufficient to meet plant watering needs. In the summer, irrigate in the early morning so water can better infiltrate deeper into the soil and not evaporate at the surface.\n4. Cycle soak and deeper watering. When irrigating, water deeply and less often. This helps encourage deeper root systems in plants which makes them more resilient during drought periods and able to maximize their storage of rainfall. When long daily irrigation runtimes are needed, divide the irrigation into 2 or 3 short cycles throughout the day that allow more time for water to infiltrate deeper into the soil with less chance of becoming runoff.\n5. Incorporate newer technologies. Smart controllers and rain and soil moisture sensors can be great tools for preventing unnecessary watering.\nDrip irrigation system vs. sprinkler system: Which is better and why?\nEach type of system has its place in the landscape. Overall, drip irrigation has an advantage over sprinklers when it comes to application efficiency. When installed below the surface (subsurface) the water applied goes straight into the soil and the plants\u2019 root zone. There are no losses due to wind or surface evaporation. However, drip systems can be very costly in larger turfgrass landscapes.\nSprinkler systems are often more cost-effective for larger spaces. High efficiencies can be achieved through proper design principles including proper spacing, pressure regulation, and incorporating multi-stream, multi-trajectory type sprinkler nozzles.\nClimate change, inflation, and high energy costs are driving up Americans\u2019 water bills. What measures can various levels of government take to lower water prices and keep them under control?\nConservation is always cheaper than having to develop new water supplies. Watering restrictions and improving infrastructure help, but also maximizing their reuse capabilities can reduce strains on the water system.\nUsing \u201creclaimed water\u201d that has been treated for reuse can allow the higher quality treated water to be used for primary potable water needs such in the home for drinking, cooking, and cleaning.\nHow much water and expense do drought-tolerant grass types really save homeowners?\nA healthy lawn can be maintained with less water than most people think.\nA common overused saying is that turfgrass requires an inch of water a week. This can be true of turfs with \u201cpeak\u201d water use which can occur around the end of July to early August over a 2-4 week period, but isn\u2019t necessary the majority of the year.\nResearch and demonstrations have shown that many turfgrasses can be maintained with as little as half an inch a week much of the year.\nIt comes down to homeowner satisfaction. As turfgrasses stress in the summer and during drought periods they are naturally going to discolor and lose their green lushness. This doesn\u2019t mean the grass has died but it is simply adapting to its current level of drought stress.\nIf homeowners are willing to accept this temporary decrease in plant quality during drought periods they can save significant amounts of water. These drought-tolerant grasses are also generally very quick to recover once it does rain.\nHow have watering restrictions and bans on grass lawns impacted homeowners?\nIt negatively affects the appearance of our lawns and may reduce home value, among other impacts.\nWhat factors determine the local cost of water to consumers?\nThe local cost of water to consumers is determined by factors such as the amount of water available and the costs of irrigation.\nWhat are your best tips for minimizing the cost of lawn irrigation?\nDeveloping and using drought-tolerant lawn grass varieties is one of the best tips for minimizing the cost of lawn irrigation.\nDrip irrigation system vs. sprinkler system: Which is better and why?\nA drip irrigation system may be considered too expensive and not suitable for lawns, while a sprinkler system might be a better option.\nClimate change, inflation, and high energy costs are driving up Americans\u2019 water bills. What measures can various levels of government take to lower water prices and keep them under control?\nVarious levels of government can promote the use of climate-friendly lawn grasses and sustainable practices to mitigate the impacts of climate change, inflation, and high energy costs on water bills.\nHow much water and expense do drought-tolerant grass types really save homeowners?\nDrought-tolerant grass types can save homeowners a significant amount of water and expense, with potential reductions in water use ranging from 50 to 90%.\nHow have watering restrictions and bans on grass lawns impacted homeowners?\nWatering restrictions and bans have driven homeowners to seek a drought-tolerant turfgrass genus and/or species. In northern climates, this includes tall fescue and fine fescue, while in southern climates, this includes bermudagrass and centipedegrass.\nWhat factors determine the local cost of water to consumers?\nWater availability typically drives water costs. The cost to irrigate turfgrass in Western Oregon, where rain is plentiful, is relatively cheap \u2014 $277 per acre per month in the summer \u2014 while the cost to irrigate turfgrass in New Mexico, where precipitation is minimal, is considerably more ($3,671 per acre per month).\nWhat are your five best tips for minimizing the cost of lawn irrigation?\nTo reduce the cost of watering your lawn I would use the following practices:\n1. Plant drought-tolerant turfgrass (tall fescue in northern climates and bermudagrass in southern climates).\n2. If you don\u2019t want to water in the summer, your turf will not die but will enter a period of seasonal dormancy, returning to green when seasonal rains return.\n3. If you want to keep turfgrass green in the summer 1.0 to 1.5 inches of irrigation per week will be required. This is best applied in 3 applications per week like \u2153 to \u00bd inch per application.\n4. If you want to apply more water, don\u2019t exceed \u00bd inch per application. Rather, add days to your irrigation cycle. Meaning irrigate 4 or 5 times per week at a maximum rate of \u00bd inch per application.\n5. For cool-season turfgrass (tall fescue, fine fescue, Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass and bentgrass), don\u2019t apply fertilizer during periods of drought stress. Fertilizer should be applied to in the spring and fall when temperatures are between 60 and 75 degrees. Summer application of fertilizer will only increase drought stress.\nDrip irrigation system vs. sprinkler system: Which is better and why?\nDrip irrigation is great for your landscape beds and garden areas, but bad for turfgrass because the coverage is not adequate to make the grass uniformly green. If you are installing an inground irrigation system, multi-stream rotating nozzle-matched precipitation (MP Rotators) provide the most efficient use of water in a lawn environment.\nClimate change, inflation, and high energy costs are driving up Americans\u2019 water bills. What measures can various levels of government take to lower water prices and keep them under control?\nMore humans on the earth mean more water use. To minimize lawn water use, governing bodies have started requiring lawns to use effluent water irrigation and implementing seasonal water use restrictions, which include lawn watering, and providing tax rebates for removing lawn areas.\nHowever, all these options come with consequences. Untreated effluent water from your home is an environmental contamination concern. Watering your lawn reduces the temperatures adjacent to your home and workplace, which will reduce the cost to air condition your home or work.\nResearch has shown that turfgrass is a substantial carbon sink reducing greenhouse gas emissions, so removing your lawn would release this sequestered carbon into the atmosphere.\nHow much water and expense do drought-tolerant grass types really save homeowners?\nUse of drought-tolerant turfgrass provides the biggest benefit when you don\u2019t water the turf. This is not possible in all areas of the USA like the southern USA and upper mountain west, but in regions where annual precipitation is significant (more than 30 inches), like the coastal PNW, midwestern, eastern, and southeastern US this is quite possible.\nThe biggest change that will be required in these areas is the acceptance of some seasonal summer drought symptoms. Drought-tolerant turfgrass in these areas will return to green color when summer temperatures decrease, and seasonal precipitation returns.\nIf you plan to irrigate your drought-tolerant turfgrass, be sure to base your water use on local evapotranspiration rates or soil moisture content in your lawn. Drought-tolerant grass will remain green during periods of peak heat stress when receiving around 50% evapotranspiration replacement or irrigated when soil moisture reaches less than 20% soil volumetric water content.\nHow have watering restrictions and bans on grass lawns impacted homeowners?\nImpact of Watering Restrictions and Lawn Bans on Homeowners:\nWater restrictions and lawn bans could impact homeowners in several ways, including creating sub-optimal quality or less attractive lawns.\nIt could also force homeowners to replace their grass with drought-tolerant or native plants that may not necessarily be their primary choices and wishes to have in their yards. In addition, restrictions could limit outdoor activities and the use of green areas for sports and enjoyment.\nDepending on the extent of the watering restrictions and severity, it could lead to reduced property values due to less attractive lawns.\nWhat factors determine the local cost of water to consumers?\nLocal water costs are affected by several factors, including:\n- Demand for water.\n- Source of water.\n- Availability of water.\n- Frequency and duration of droughts and extreme weather events.\n- Water distribution mechanisms.\n- Infrastructure-related costs.\n- Any laws and regulations, including fees from cities and municipalities related to water and sewerage systems.\nWhat are your five best tips for minimizing the cost of lawn irrigation?\n1. Lowering irrigation water costs could involve several factors, including improving irrigation water use efficiency by adopting smart irrigation systems that allow the application of water that plants need.\n2. Irrigation should always aim to meet plant water requirements not met by rainfall. Soil moisture sensors, rain sensors, and weather stations could help monitor plant water requirements. The irrigation schedule needs to be seasonally adjusted to account for evapotranspiration demands.\n3. When available, alternative water sources, including water from rainwater harvesting and wastewater treatment plants, should be considered.\n4. It is also important to regularly inspect and maintain irrigation systems for leaks, clogs, or inefficiencies, and fix defects with parts with the same specifications.\n5. Additionally, lawn irrigation costs could be reduced by planting drought-tolerant and native plants, and lawn grass could be completely avoided by replacing it with artificial grass or other pavements, sand, etc.\nDrip irrigation system vs. sprinkler system: Which is better and why?\nDrip irrigation allows localized water application near plants to maximize water use efficiency through reduced evaporation losses.\nOn the other hand, a sprinkler irrigation system applies water using sprinkler heads with different radii and applies water to the entire area. The area\u2019s coverage could be small or big and could usually lead to land irrigation between plants.\nOverall, a drip irrigation system is considered the most efficient due to reduced losses from irrigation and the absence of other losses, including wind drift.\nIn contrast, overhead sprinkler systems, while with better efficiency than other irrigation systems, such as flood and seepage, remain less efficient than drip.\nHowever, it should also be noted that drip irrigation systems may not be a good fit for places where water quality, such as sediments, is an issue. Proper filtration systems and regular maintenance will be needed to avoid emitter clogging. This leads to clogging and continuous support.\nClimate change, inflation, and high energy costs are driving up Americans\u2019 water bills. What measures can various levels of government take to lower water prices and keep them under control?\nSeveral measures could be taken to lower water prices and control costs, including:\n- Investing in infrastructure to improve efficiency with reduced water loss through leaking and other mechanisms.\n- Balancing water supply and demand is also critical.\n- Planting the right crops in the right places is important.\n- Promoting agriculture and other irrigation practices where water is available and optimal climate is critical.\n- Promoting water rebate programs to incentivize homeowners and concerned citizens to adopt water-efficient irrigation and household utilities, including shower heads, faucets, toilets, etc., contributes to the efficient use of water resources and reduces costs.\n- Protecting available water resources from pollution is also important.\n- Promoting rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge programs is another consideration.\nHow much water and expense do drought-tolerant grass types really save homeowners?\nDrought-tolerant grass types and native plants could significantly reduce water usage and expenses for homeowners compared to traditional grass species. Water savings could be even higher, especially in regions with severe water scarcity or drought issues.\nThe exact savings from drought-tolerant grass is expected to vary from place to place depending on several factors, including water availability, competing needs for water, cost of water, and climate.\nHowever, planting drought-tolerant and native plants typically requires less frequent irrigation. This, in turn, will save homeowners money from water bills and lawn care and maintenance costs.\nBehind the ranking\nFirst, we determined the factors (metrics) that are most relevant to rank the Most Expensive Cities for Watering the Lawn. We then assigned a weight to each factor based on its importance and grouped those factors into 3 categories:\n- Cost Determinants\n- Cost\n- Yard Size\nThe categories, factors, and their weights are listed in the table below.\nFor each of the 500 biggest U.S. cities, we then gathered data on each factor from the sources listed below the table. We eliminated 2 cities lacking sufficient data in a single category, resulting in a final sample size of 498 cities.\nFinally, we calculated scores (out of 100 points) for each city to determine its rank in each factor, each category, and overall. A city\u2019s Overall Score is the average of its scores across all factors and categories. The highest Overall Score ranked \u201cMost Expensive\u201d (No. 1) and the lowest \u201cMost Affordable\u201d (No. 498).\nNotes:\n- The \u201cMost Affordable\u201d among individual factors may not be No. 498 due to ties.\n- Water Requirement for Most Common Grass Type(s): Scores were awarded based on the level of watering required to maintain the health of the most common type(s) of grass in each city as follows:\n- Light = 1 point\n- Medium = 2 points\n- High = 3 points\n- Legality of Rainwater Harvesting in State: Scores were awarded based on legal leniency as follows:\n- Restricted = 0 points\n- Permit may be required = 0.5 points\n- Some restrictions = 1 point\n- No restrictions = 2 points\n- Some restrictions but offers incentives = 2.5 points\n- No restrictions and offers incentives = 3 points\n- Drought Susceptibility: Calculated by FEMA, this index considers annualized frequency of and exposure to drought, as well as social vulnerability and community resilience factors.\nSources: Almanac, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Housing Finance Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Nature\u2019s Seed, U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and World Water Reserve\nWater wisely\nDid you know that according to the EPA, watering the average U.S. lawn for 20 minutes every day for a week uses as much water as running your shower non-stop for 4 days, or taking more than 800 showers, the equivalent of an average family\u2019s showers for an entire year?\nOutdoor irrigation accounts for nearly 8 billion gallons of U.S. water use each day, and up to 50% of that is lost to evaporation, wind, and runoff. At the same time, the average American water bill has climbed 4.6% from 2023 to 2024, with combined water/sewer bills up 24% over 5 years.\nBy fine-tuning your irrigation and landscape choices with the helpful tips below, you can slash outdoor water use and keep more money in your pocket.\n- Water early in the morning to minimize evaporation.\n- Choose native or drought-tolerant grass varieties that require less irrigation.\n- Consider xeriscaping. Combine drought-resistant plants, mulch, and hardscaping to reduce thirsty lawn areas.\n- Monitor soil moisture to avoid overwatering and reduce risks of pests, weeds, and lawn diseases.\n- Replace traditional sprinklers with efficient drip irrigation for targeted watering.\n- Upgrade to smart irrigation controllers that adjust watering based on weather and soil conditions.\n- Hand-water delicate or container plants to conserve water.\n- Install rain barrels or cisterns to capture and reuse rainwater for irrigation.\n- Consider eco-friendly lawn alternatives like groundcovers, ornamental grasses, or even rentable animal \u201clawn mowers.\u201d\nHire a local Lawn Love crew to design and install a water-wise lawn and landscape for your property.\nMedia Resources\nQuotes from Lawn Love Editor-in-Chief Sharon Sullivan:\n- Water bills are hitting hard in 6 cities, including Pasco, Washington (No. 21), Goodyear, Arizona (No. 2), and Louisville, Kentucky (No. 339), along with 3 Texas cities, Brownsville (No. 3), Pharr (No. 20), and Mission (No. 7). Households here spend 1% or more of their income on water.\n- 15 states tie for having the most water-dependent grass varieties, including 15 cities in Michigan, 16 in Colorado, and 13 in Massachusetts.\n- The Pacific Northwest might have a rainy reputation, but 177 cities in our ranking outpace this soggy region\u2019s showers, with Eugene, Oregon (No. 247), leading the region with an average of 3.4 inches of rain monthly. Oregon and much of the West are locked in the worst megadrought in 1,000 years.\n- New York and Massachusetts are cashing in on cooler climates and smaller yards. Every city from these neighbors in our ranking landed in the more affordable half, with Boston (No. 496) and New York City (No. 497) coming out ahead, thanks to shorter growing seasons, fewer scorchers, and smaller lawns that keep water bills in check.\n- Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico face the lowest rainfall, each getting less than 1 inch of rain per month. Among California\u2019s 178 ranked cities, 13 fall below the 1-inch mark, along with Yakima, Washington (No. 44), and 3 Idaho cities. Flagstaff, Arizona (No. 474), is an exception, receiving 1.71 inches monthly on average.\n- Some states encourage rainwater harvesting, while others restrict the practice. Permits may be required to collect rainwater in Kansas and North Dakota.\n- High-resolution images of cities\n- 2024\u2019s Most Expensive Cities for Watering the Lawn ranking results\n- 2022\u2019s Best Cities for Lawn Irrigation ranking results\nMain Photo Credit: Images 1 and 2 by Karolina Grabowska via Pexels (cropped and overlaid)"

This delay results from the procedures to quality control the meteorological data used to estimate evaporative demand.\nA drought index combines multiple drought indicators (e.g., precipitation, temperature, soil moisture) to depict drought conditions. For some products, like the U.S. Drought Monitor, authors combine their analysis of drought indicators with input from local observers. Other drought indices, like the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), use an objective calculation to describe the severity, location, timing, and/or duration of drought.\nLearn MoreFlash drought is the rapid onset or intensification of drought. Unlike slow-evolving drought, which is caused by a decline in precipitation, flash drought occurs when low precipitation is accompanied by abnormally high temperatures, high winds, and/or changes in radiation. These sometimes-rapid changes can quickly raise evapotranspiration rates and remove available water from the landscape.\nLearn MoreDrought can result in reduced growth rates, increased stress on vegetation, and alterations or transformations to the plant community and/or the entire ecosystem. During periods of drought, plants increase their demand for water through increased evapotranspiration and longer growing seasons.\nLearn MoreDuring drought conditions, fuels for wildfire, such as grasses and trees, can dry out and become more flammable. Drought can also increase the probability of ignition and the rate at which fire spreads. Temperature, soil moisture, humidity, wind speed, and fuel availability (vegetation) are all factors that interact to influence the frequency of large wildfires.\nLearn MoreA drought index combines multiple drought indicators (e.g., precipitation, temperature, soil moisture) to depict drought conditions.

  "argos_summary": "A recent study by Lawn Love has identified Buckeye, Arizona, as the most expensive city in the U.S. for watering a lawn, primarily due to its dry climate and high water costs. The top ten cities for lawn watering expenses are dominated by locations in Arizona and Texas, while Washington, D.C. ranks as the cheapest due to smaller yard sizes. As drought conditions worsen across the country, homeowners are increasingly turning to drought-tolerant landscaping and efficient watering practices to manage rising water bills.",
