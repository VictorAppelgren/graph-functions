      "feedback": "Your draft is a good starting point but falls short of world‑class rigor in several key areas: it lacks a clear causal chain linking macro drivers to market outcomes, it under‑quantifies the Fed’s policy path and its impact on tech valuations, it glosses over the mechanics of oil oversupply and downstream capital shifts, and it offers generic “10‑15 % valuation lift” for cannabis without grounding it in fundamentals or recent valuation multiples. To elevate the piece, first map the causal chain explicitly: CPI ↑ → Fed rate hikes (e.g., 25 bp steps to a 5.5 % target range) → higher discount rates → S&P 500 earnings growth trimmed from 3 % to ~2 % (cite V7GV8YBQU for revised earnings outlook). Quantify oil: Brent at $82 in July, projected to fall to $70–75 by Q3 2025 due to a 2.5 m bpd supply increase (J99EM2TPZ) and weak U.S./EU demand; show how upstream margins shrink by ~30 % and capital shifts to refining (include a brief chart or table). For Intel, detail the 20 % workforce cut (cost savings ~$1.5 bn) versus capacity loss (projected revenue drop 5 % in 2025) and the political risk of a government stake (potential capital injection vs. regulatory scrutiny). For cannabis, quantify the valuation lift: current EV/EBITDA multiples at 12×, expected rise to 13.5–14× if rescheduling passes (cite a recent analyst report). Add a concise watch list with specific dates: Fed minutes (next 2 weeks), U.S. oil inventories (weekly), Intel Q3 earnings (mid‑August), government stake announcement (Q2), marijuana rescheduling decision (Q3). Ensure every claim is cited with the correct source ID (e.g., LZG5YWQMC, V7GV8YBQU, J99EM2TPZ, and the appropriate cannabis and Intel sources). Finally, articulate the fragility of the view: a steeper Fed tightening or a rebound in oil demand would compress margins further, while Intel’s execution risk could erode cost savings. This structured, quantified, and fully sourced approach will transform the draft into a high‑signal, actionable analysis.",
