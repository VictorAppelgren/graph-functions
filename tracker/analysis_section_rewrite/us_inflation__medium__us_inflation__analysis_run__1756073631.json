      "feedback": "The draft shows breadth and a plausible causal narrative (policy backdrop driving auto/ durables demand, Cadillac signaling via Elevated Velocity, GM’s domestic-capital spend, and tariff-flow via dealer tools), but it lacks a crisp 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, invalidations, timing windows, and quantified transmission; it also treats a few intersource conflicts (tariff magnitude and fiscal bills) too glibly and underuses the numeric detail available in the sources. Actionable edits: restructure into a tight 3–6 month scenario map (Base case; Tariff pass-through/upside if pre-tariff buying persists; Tariff-tightening/downside if tariffs stay or rise; Policy surprise/legislation shift). For each scenario, specify: (i) catalysts and likely timing windows (e.g., tariff announcements/front-loading demand in Apr–May vs. H2 softness per Deutsche Bank note; GM’s US‑production ramp milestones at Orion/Spring Hill/ Fairfax timelines in the GM investment piece); (ii) the exact invalidations that would overturn it (e.g., tariff rollback or delay beyond a defined window; GM failing to sustain 2M US annual output by 2027; regulatory delays on Cadillac/V‑Series EVs); (iii) a crisp channel map (policy → input costs → pass-through to vehicle prices → demand elasticities; dealer AI pricing tools enabling margin management; pre-tariff promotions as per the “pre-tariff deals” narrative). Quantify where possible using the sources: GM’s $4B U.S. manufacturing push and target to lift output to “multi‑million” cadence; the 2M annual US vehicle capacity and the 10–12B capex trajectory through 2027; tariff levels (25% on vehicles and parts) and the likely near-term front-loading vs. later-cost pass-through; the Deutsche Bank view of robust early-month demand with potential H2 weakness; and the Cadillac signaling (Elevated Velocity, Terra/e‑Velocity modes) as a portfolio mix signal. Integrate conflict signals by presenting a concise Source‑conflict note (e.g., OB B A vs. 3.4 trillion vs. 4.4 trillion fiscal estimates) and attach a sensitivity band rather than a single figure. Deepen the quantitative edge by anchoring a base-case price/demand/margin outline (e.g., expected price-pressure range from tariff pass-through, estimated demand lift from front-loaded buys, implied GM margins from the EV ramp) drawn directly from the cited items. Expand watch-list signals to include: tariff developments (timing and scope), GM production milestones for EV platforms, Cadillac/V‑Series product-announcements, and Pace/volume signals from Pacaso/Range‑style private‑asset platforms as sentiment/financing proxies; ensure every line cites the appropriate IDs. Rebalance the narrative so the causal chain is explicit, with a clean, end-state base case plus 1–2 clearly defined alts and a concise risk matrix (policy risk, execution risk in EV ramp, and demand-macing tariff risk). Format-wise, reduce hedging phrases, attach per-item citations to each trigger/assumption, and end with a succinct 3–4 sentence conclusion that states the base-case confidence and the principal risks. Citations to anchor each claim should cover WTNT85IPR, EPJYXB7DX, V8TEZOR8R, UPV3X2MQ6, and ILYC1M41F.",
