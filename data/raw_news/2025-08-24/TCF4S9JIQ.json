  "content": "Cineworld\u2019s Big Screen Weekend: Two Days of Cinema Glory All films, all formats \u2013 all yours for just \u00a34 a ticket\n\nONE TO WATCH Book cinema tickets for just \u00a34 with Cineworld\n\nCINEWORLD\u2019S Big Screen Weekend is rolling out nationwide this weekend, where you can get cinema tickets for just \u00a34 for all films in all formats, but hurry this is a limited time offer.\n\nOn Saturday, August 30 and Sunday August 31, every Cineworld cinema in the UK will transform into a two-day celebration of cinema\u2019s biggest line-ups.\n\nThink IMAX as the biggest stage of them all, 4DX as the only stage with wind machines, ScreenX as the panorama stage, and Superscreen so bright you will need sunscreen.\n\nIt is a two day takeover of every Cineworld nationwide, where every screen becomes a stage and every seat is the best in the house. Swap your wellies for Pepsies and send off summer with a cinematic bang - only at Cineworld.\n\nFrom brand new headliners like Caught Stealing, Eddington, The Life of Chuck and The Roses, to the encore return of summer blockbusters including The Fantastic Four: First Steps, The Naked Gun, Weapons, Jurassic World: Rebirth, The Bad Guys 2, How To Train Your Dragon and more \u2013 this is cinema\u2019s ultimate line-up.\n\nCaught Stealing, Eddington, The Life of Chuck, The Roses and Nobody 2 - alongside the triumphant return of blockbuster season standouts like Fantastic Four: First Steps, Naked Gun, Weapons, Jurassic World: Rebirth, Superman, F1 and more.\n\nIMAX \u2013 The Biggest stage of them all\n\nGo big before summer ends with jaw-dropping scale and front-row-to-the-universe visuals. Across the UK and Ireland, Cineworld\u2019s 26 IMAX screens are ready to deliver a summer finale you\u2019ll feel in your bones, including the world-class IMAX with Laser at Cineworld Leicester Square \u2013 the West End\u2019s only IMAX screen.\n\nThis Big Screen Weekend, the 4DX Arena at Cineworld is making waves, literally. Cool down with live spray, feel the gusts from wind machines and hang on as your seat does the crowd surfing for you. For the first time ever, you can experience Jaws in 4DX for only \u00a34, with every splash, surge and shiver hitting you right in the face.\n\nScreenX \u2013 The only stage that surrounds you\n\nWith 270\u00b0 panoramic screens, ScreenX spills the action into the wings, wrapping you in the story like a festival crowd that just won\u2019t let you go. It\u2019s cinema on all sides, more sides than a festival map \u2013 where every glance feels like you\u2019re catching a new act. From sweeping landscapes to heart-pounding chases, the ScreenX stage surrounds you in a way no other screen can, turning every seat into the best view in the house.\n\nSuperscreen \u2013 So right you will need Sunscreen\n\nSPF 100 - Sound, picture, feels. With laser projection powering vast wall-to-wall screens, every frame bursts with colour and clarity you can feel. Dolby Atmos delivers sound that crowd-surfs straight to your ears, pure big screen energy, bigger than any festival headliner could dream of.\n\nRefuel between screenings with the chart-topping snacks of the cinema world. Rollover Hot Dogs bring the longest set of the day, Pepsi Max takes the mic as the official thirst breaker, and Pick \u2019n\u2019 Mix delivers 100 acts in one bag. Baskin Robbins serves up 31 flavours on one stage, and frozen ice drinks, serving frosty bangers all weekend long.\n\nCasey Cohen, VP of International Marketing at Cineworld, said: \"This weekend, Cineworld turns into a nationwide jam session for your eyeballs \u2013 where the screens are bigger, the sound is louder, the mosh pit has cup holders, and every film is a main act. Come celebrate the last big weekend of summer for just \u00a34 a ticket in all formats. This weekend belongs to the big screen.\"\n\nTwo days. All films. All formats. Only \u00a34. Exclusively at Cineworld. We\u2019ll See You in the Dark.\n\nBOOK YOUR TICKETS TODAY BEFORE IT\u2019S TOO LATE!",
