  "title": "PSA: YouTube will start guessing your age from today",
  "description": "Starting today, YouTube will use AI to guess the age of its US viewers and will automatically apply age restrictions for those under 18.",
  "content": "YouTube will start rolling out its new AI-powered age estimation system in the US beginning today, August 13. First announced last month, the feature uses artificial intelligence to determine whether a user is likely under 18, based on factors such as their viewing habits, YouTube search history, and how long their account has been active. This process applies to all YouTube accounts, regardless of the birthdate entered during sign-up.\n\nIf YouTube\u2019s AI concludes you\u2019re under 18, you\u2019ll receive a notification informing you of the same. You can dispute this by verifying your age through a government-issued ID, a selfie, or a credit card.\n\nFor accounts flagged as belonging to teens, YouTube will automatically enable its age-appropriate features, which include:\n\u2022 Turning on digital wellbeing tools like \u201ctake a break\u201d and bedtime reminders by default\n\u2022 Reducing recommendations for videos that could be problematic if watched repeatedly And has been YouTube\u2019s rule for years, you must be 18 or older to view age-restricted videos.\n\nWhile YouTube intends to protect young viewers, some users haven\u2019t taken well to its new age estimation efforts. Many worry the system might label them as teenagers based solely on certain viewing patterns.\n\n\u201cI let my cousins\u2019 kids watch some of their shows when I\u2019m babysitting them, and I don\u2019t care to give my ID to YouTube, especially since I have had a Google account for like 20 odd years now,\u201d a user noted on Reddit.\n\n\u201cPok\u00e9mon, Minecraft, Anime, and Roblox are for everyone! We understand that users on YouTube have a variety of interests. Our age estimation model does not look at one form of content in isolation to determine if an account is under the age of 18. The model assesses many different signals to reach this determination, including but not limited to YouTube activity and longevity across a user\u2019s account. It is not focused on any specific genre or type of video,\u201d the company had said.\n\n\u201cWith this rise of AI and increased demand for users\u2019 personal information, I truly believe that the internet will be so fundamentally different in 5 years that parts of it will simply become broken,\u201d a user wrote on\n\nYouTube emphasizes that ID submission is optional, and those who opt out can still use the platform with the standard teen protections applied. Teen accounts can access most content on YouTube, except for age-restricted videos containing excessive violence or nudity.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nGet ready to be embarrassed: YouTube will start using your view history to guess if you're an adult\nJuly 29, 2025\n- Earlier this year, YouTube announced plans to bring an age-verification system to the US.\n- Tests are starting over the next few weeks, with plans to expand widely later on.\n- YouTube will use AI to flag accounts based on teen-like usage patterns, and ask these users to prove their age.\nWe\u2019re currently in the middle of a rather regrettable trend taking hold across the globe, as online services increasingly demand that users positively authenticate themselves \u2014 or at the very least establish their ages. Over in the UK they\u2019re all having a bunch of fun* (fun not guaranteed) with the Online Safety Act right now, and the US is likely to face a new wave of similar requirements, after a bad Supreme Court ruling last month. Earlier this year, YouTube shared some of its own plans for age verification, and it\u2019s now getting ready to flip the switch.\nOver the next few weeks, YouTube will begin testing its age-checking tools on a small group of US users. Rather than initially demanding to see a copy of your ID, the system will start by attempting to guess your age based on your YouTube usage.\nWhile YouTube is obviously not going to provide a detailed breakdown of the sort of things that might flag you as a teen, it attempts to explain in broad strokes:\nWe will use AI to interpret a variety of signals that help us to determine whether a user is over or under 18. These signals include the types of videos a user is searching for, the categories of videos they have watched, or the longevity of the account.\nIt\u2019s not hard to read that and see there being plenty of edge cases where new adult accounts viewing more youth-oriented content could easily trigger YouTube\u2019s suspicions. If that does happen, it\u2019s at this point that you\u2019ll have the option to share a copy of your ID or a credit card with the site, proving your actual age. If you do not, you won\u2019t be able to view age-restricted content and YouTube will activate its additional teen safeguards.\nWe\u2019ll be very curious to see just how many YouTube viewers end up complaining about being singled-out based on their habits for this extra check \u2014 and how many might feel a tad embarrassed by their YouTube history not looking \u201cadult\u201d enough to pass. Feel free to run a few searches for videos on setting up a 401(k) to get ahead of YouTube\u2019s AI scans.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
