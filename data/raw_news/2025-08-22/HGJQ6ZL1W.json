  "content": "Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares slipped on Friday after reports surfaced that the company has halted work on its H20 artificial intelligence chip for China, just as domestic rival DeepSeek unveiled a new model optimized for local processors.\n\nThe developments underscore mounting headwinds for Nvidia in a critical market where Beijing is accelerating efforts to reduce reliance on U.S. technology.\n\nDeepSeek, one of China\u2019s most closely watched AI startups, launched its upgraded V3.1 model on Thursday. The system is designed to run on domestic chips, reflecting Beijing\u2019s push for technological self-sufficiency.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia\u2019s AI Expansion Could Push Revenue To $300 Billion By 2026, Analyst Says\n\nThe update introduces faster processing capabilities, a new FP8 precision format, and a hybrid inference structure capable of toggling between reasoning and non-reasoning tasks. The company also added a \u201cdeep thinking\u201d feature to its platforms and plans to implement new API pricing beginning September 6.\n\nThe move comes after DeepSeek encountered performance hurdles with Huawei\u2019s Ascend processors, forcing the startup to rely on Nvidia hardware for earlier models. Its R1 release in January rattled global markets, erasing roughly $600 billion in Nvidia\u2019s market value amid fears of a serious new competitor.\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia is facing heightened regulatory pressure in China. The company has reportedly instructed suppliers, including Amkor Technology (NASDAQ:AMKR) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), to suspend work on its China-focused H20 chip.\n\nThe pause follows meetings between Chinese regulators and tech giants such as Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) and ByteDance, in which officials urged companies to pivot away from Nvidia hardware in favor of domestic alternatives from Huawei and Cambricon.\n\nAnalysts caution that the disruption could weigh on Nvidia\u2019s near-term results. KeyBanc Capital Markets estimates that excluding China sales could cut quarterly revenue by $2 billion to $3 billion. However, strong global demand and the company\u2019s rollout of its next-generation Blackwell B200 chips may help offset some of the pressure. China contributed 13% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in fiscal 2024, highlighting the strategic importance of the market.\n\nDespite the latest setback, Nvidia stock has gained more than 30% this year, cementing its dominance in the graphics processing unit segment as Big Tech players including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) pour billions into AI infrastructure.\n\nPrice Action: NVDA stock is trading lower by 1.14% to $172.98 premarket at last check Friday.",

Details here \u2192\nNvidia NVDA is set to beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations once again, driven by surging demand for AI and its new Blackwell architecture.\nWith a strong revenue forecast of $48 billion for the second quarter and expectations for continued growth through 2026, the company\u2019s Data Center segment remains the primary growth engine, positioning Nvidia for sustained leadership in AI infrastructure.\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse has upped his price forecast for Nvidia to $240, citing the company\u2019s Blackwell-driven Data Center expansion and the rapid acceleration of AI investments.\nAlso Read: Nvidia Could Add Billions From China Sales If H20 GPUs Get Green Light From US: Analyst\nMuse maintains his Overweight rating on the stock, noting that Nvidia\u2019s revenue is likely to surpass consensus estimates through 2026.\nMuse pointed to surging demand for artificial intelligence computing and the company\u2019s new Blackwell architecture ramp.\nThe analyst expects Nvidia to deliver a strong beat again and raise when it reports fiscal second-quarter results on August 27. He projects revenue of $48 billion and EPS of $1.06, compared with consensus expectations of $45.8 billion and $1.00 per share.\nData Center sales remain the core driver, with Muse forecasting $42.9 billion from that segment alone. Looking ahead to the October quarter, he estimates $55 billion in revenue and $1.25 in EPS, again ahead of consensus at $52.6 billion and $1.18, with Data Center contributing about $49.9 billion.\nFor the long term, Muse models Nvidia\u2019s Data Center revenue at $200 billion in calendar 2025 and $300 billion in calendar 2026, well above current Street forecasts of $181 billion and $235 billion, respectively.\nHe projects earnings power of $4.85 per share in calendar 2025 and $8.00 in calendar 2026, compared with consensus at $4.37 and $5.89.\nHe highlighted accelerating hyperscaler capital expenditures, expected to grow 57% in calendar 2025 and another 20% in calendar 2026, a $1.5 trillion global sovereign AI investment pipeline, and increasing enterprise adoption as the key drivers of this expansion.\nMuse acknowledged ongoing headwinds in China due to H20 export restrictions and tariffs, but argued that most sell-side models already exclude that revenue.\nAny unexpected shipments to the region could therefore provide upside to current estimates. He also noted that Nvidia\u2019s gross margins should reach the mid-70% range by late calendar 2025, supported by the mix shift to Blackwell products and ongoing efficiency gains.\nThe analyst underscored that Nvidia\u2019s roadmap beyond Blackwell, including its Rubin platform, further strengthens visibility into calendar 2026 and positions the company for sustained leadership in AI infrastructure.\nNVDA Price Action: Nvidia stock is trading higher by 0.92% to $182.11 at last check Monday.\nRead Next:\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

The startup was forced to fall back on Nvidia chips for training, while relying on Huawei hardware only for inference tasks.\nDeepSeek's Growing Impact On Global AI\nDeepSeek first made headlines in January when its R1 model triggered a $600 billion sell-off in Nvidia's market value. Founder Liang Wenfeng has since pushed for aggressive model updates, including the V3 release in March and the R1 update in May.\nNvidia acknowledged DeepSeek's early success, saying the startup's work demonstrated how models can scale using widely available compute while remaining compliant with U.S. export controls.\nChina's Broader Push For Tech Independence\nThe latest development comes as Beijing pushes for domestic chip adoption.

Details here \u2192\nNvidia NVDA is pressing ahead with a China strategy that balances U.S. export restrictions with the need to defend market share in one of its most important regions.\nThe company is developing a new AI chip, tentatively called the B30A, built on its latest Blackwell architecture, Reuters reported on Tuesday.\nAccording to people briefed on the matter, the B30A will use a single-die design, delivering about half the raw computing power of the company\u2019s flagship dual-die B300 accelerator, but more potent than the H20 model Nvidia is currently allowed to sell in China.\nAlso Read: Beijing Asks Alibaba, ByteDance Why They Need Nvidia H20 Chips Instead Of Local Alternatives\nThe chip will include high-bandwidth memory and NVLink connectivity, both of which appear in the H20, a Hopper-based processor customized for the Chinese market.\nNvidia hopes to ship samples to Chinese customers for testing by September.\nChina accounted for 13% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in fiscal 2024. After an abrupt ban in April, Nvidia only regained permission to sell H20 in July.\nLast week, President Donald Trump signaled that his administration might allow Nvidia to sell scaled-down versions of its most advanced chips in China with 30% to 50% reductions in computing power.\nNVIDIA\u2019s stock gained 36% year-to-date as Big Tech giants like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL keep splurging on their AI ambitions, fueling demand for Nvidia processors.\nNvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD have already agreed to a deal requiring them to hand over 15% of revenue from advanced chip sales in China to the U.S. government.\nIn parallel, Nvidia is preparing to roll out another China-specific processor, the RTX6000D, which is also based on Blackwell but tuned for AI inference.\nThis chip will feature conventional GDDR memory and bandwidth capped at 1,398 GB/s, just under the 1.4 TB/s limit imposed by new U.S. rules. The RTX6000D will also be priced below the H20 and is scheduled for initial deliveries in September.\nAnalysts remain divided on Nvidia\u2019s outlook in China. Bernstein warned that U.S. export controls and the rise of local players like Huawei could shrink Nvidia\u2019s market share from 66% in 2024 to 54% in 2025, with China\u2019s AI chip localization ratio climbing to 55% by 2027.\nIn contrast, Needham\u2019s N. Quinn Bolton struck a bullish tone, projecting $3 billion in quarterly H20 shipments with near-100% margins on written-down inventory and forecasting $20 billion in China data center sales by fiscal 2028, supported by strong demand for upcoming Blackwell GPU variants.\nPrice Action: NVDA stock is trading higher by 0.33% to $182.61 premarket at last check Tuesday.\nRead Next:\nImage by El editorial via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
