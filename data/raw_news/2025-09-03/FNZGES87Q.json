  "content": "During IFA 2025, Acer has introduced the Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation, a compact system designed to deliver server-grade performance for artificial intelligence workloads in a small form factor. The device is built around the NVIDIA GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, combining next-generation CUDA cores, fifth-generation Tensor Cores, and 20 Arm-based CPU cores. With this configuration, the workstation achieves up to 1 petaflop (PFLOPS) of FP4 AI performance, offering significant processing capabilities for demanding AI applications.\n\nThe Veriton GN100 comes with 128 GB of unified memory and 4 TB of NVMe M.2 SSD storage, enabling smooth operation for large-scale models while minimizing bottlenecks in data transfer. This hardware package positions the GN100 as a suitable solution for developers, researchers, and organizations looking to work with advanced AI workloads locally, rather than relying exclusively on cloud-based infrastructure.\n\nTo support AI development, the system includes the NVIDIA AI software stack pre-installed. This provides access to widely used tools and frameworks such as PyTorch, Jupyter, and Ollama, allowing developers and students to prototype, fine-tune, and deploy large language models (LLMs) on the device. The integration of these frameworks ensures that users can transition smoothly from experimentation to deployment without additional setup.\n\nA notable feature of the Veriton GN100 is its expandability through system linking. Using the NVIDIA ConnectX-7 SmartNIC, two units can be connected to scale workloads further, enabling support for AI models with up to 405 billion parameters. This makes the workstation capable of handling larger training and inference tasks that would traditionally require data center infrastructure.\n\nDespite its power, the GN100 emphasizes efficiency and security. The workstation supports Wi-Fi 7 for high-speed wireless connectivity and includes a variety of ports: four USB 3.2 Type-C, one HDMI, and an Ethernet jack. Additionally, it features Kensington lock support for physical security, reinforcing its suitability for professional and academic environments.\n\nThe product will be available in multiple regions with pricing starting at USD 3,999 in North America. Specifications and availability may vary depending on the market, and Acer advises checking regional offices for details.\n\nFiled in . Read more about Acer, IFA and IFA 2025.",
