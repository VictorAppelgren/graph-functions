      "text": "Most flagship phones these days boast some level of water resistance, and you\u2019ll find \u201cIP ratings\u201d on everything from the Apple iPhone 16 to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. But that got us wondering: Just what do manufacturers mean when they use terms like \u201cwaterproof\u201d and \u201cwater-resistant?\u201d What constitutes a \u201crugged\u201d device? Just how many times can you drop your phone in the toilet before you can expect it to bite the dust?\nAs it turns out, some terms that describe a phone\u2019s ruggedness are actually standardized, and there\u2019s a whole lot more to them than meets the eye. IP ratings measure a device\u2019s resistance to water, dust, and other particles, while military specs describe structural integrity. Some certifications are a little less precise than others, but taken together, they give a rough idea of how the best waterproof smartphones will hold up against the elements.\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about IP ratings \u2014 and as a bonus, we\u2019re throwing in in formation about MIL-STD certifications for physical damage, too.\nThe ratings behind a \u2018rugged\u2019 product\n\u201cRugged\u201d is just a word, a marketing ploy as meaningless as \u201csummer-proof,\u201d \u201cwater-resistant,\u201d or \u201cdustproof.\u201d All make nice bullet points on a phone\u2019s spec sheet, but they aren\u2019t all that descriptive \u2014 \u201crugged\u201d and \u201cwater-resistant\u201d devices can short just as easily as \u201cnon-rugged\u201d devices when they fall into water (as well as shatter when they hit concrete).\nA certification is something completely different. When a phone has a certified rating of some sort, a third party has conducted tests to ensure that it can survive conditions like hard falls, dusty shelves, extreme heat, certain kinds of radiation, and deep pools of water.\nPhone, tablet, and PC manufacturers measure the ruggedness of devices using two systems of standards: The Ingress Protection (IP) rating, published by the International Electrotechnical Commission; and the Military Specification or Military Standard (MIL-STD), which is developed by arms of the U.S. Military and Department of Defense.\nIngress Protection rating\nA smartphone\u2019s IP rating is determined by how well it holds up against dirt, dust, and water. Ratings range from 1 to 6 for dust and dirt and 1 to 9 for water, with the first and second digits in the rating indicating how well it withstands exposure to solid particles and liquids, respectively. The maximum rating for solid objects, IP6, means it lets in very little dust and dirt, and a water-resistance rating of 8 indicates it can be submerged in water for minutes at a time. A phone with those specs would earn an IP68 rating.\nTo make matters more complicated, a high IP rating doesn\u2019t necessarily mean dust, water, or debris won\u2019t enter a phone\u2019s enclosure. Rather, it indicates that when dust and water do make their way through a phone\u2019s seams, they won\u2019t enter in sufficient quantities to cause malfunction. So the IP67-rated iPhone SE will not be as resistant to water entry as the IP68-rated iPhone 16 Pro, even though both phones will come out of the pool just as wet.\nHowever, IP ratings are not all-encompassing, and phones need not pass every lower test to snag a higher rating. For example, for a smartphone to nab the coveted IP68 certification, it has to pass the tests for IPX7 and 8 \u2014 but is not required to test for water jets on the IPX5 and 6 levels.\nThat\u2019s the reason you sometimes see a smartphone with multiple IP ratings. The Sony Xperia 1 IV is rated both IP65 and IP68, which signifies it\u2019s resistant to total immersion and high-pressure water jets. However, as you might expect from us continuing to use a very old phone as an example, such practice has become very rare. Most companies default to IP68 and leave it there.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the ratings for solid foreign objects.\n| Level | Object size it protects against | Effective against |\n| 0 | Not protected | No protection against solid objects |\n| 1 | >50mm | Protection against large surfaces like the back of the hand |\n| 2 | >12.5mm | Protection against finger-sized objects |\n| 3 | >2.5mm | Protection against thick wires and similar objects |\n| 4 | >1mm | Protection against wires, screws, etc. |\n| 5 | Dust-protected | Some protection against dust, and complete protection against contact |\n| 6 | Dust-tight | Complete protection against dust and contact |\nThere\u2019s a separate chart for water ratings. Note they\u2019re described in terms of \u201cwater nozzles\u201d and \u201cjets\u201d \u2014 a manufacturer like Samsung, Apple, or Google can choose to expose their phone to high-pressure blasts of water from an industrial hose and see how it fares over time.\n| Level | Object size it protects against | Effective against |\n| 0 | Not protected | Nothing |\n| 1 | Dripping water | Protection against 10 minutes of dripping water |\n| 2 | Dripping water when tilted up to 15 degrees | Protection against 10 minutes of dripping water when tilted 15 degrees from normal position |\n| 3 | Spraying water | Protection against 5 minutes of spraying water at any angle up to 60 degrees from the vertical |\n| 4 | Splashing water | Protection against 5 minutes of splashing water |\n| 5 | Water jets | Protected against at least 3 minutes of water spraying from a 6.3mm nozzle from any direction |\n| 6 | Powerful water jets | Protection against at least 3 minutes of water spraying from a powerful nozzle (12.5mm) from any direction |\n| 7 | Immersion up to 1 meter | Protection against 30 minutes of water up to 1 meter of submersion |\n| 8 | Immersion beyond 1 meter | Protection against continuous immersion in water up to depth specified by the manufacturer |\n| 9 | High-pressure, close-range jets |\nProtection against continuous high-pressure, close-range jets of water from any direction \u2014 including high-temperature steam jets |\nHere\u2019s a list of some devices (and a case) with a detailed description of what you can expect from them in terms of water and dust resistance:\n| Phone | IP rating | Effective against |\n| Apple iPhone SE | IP67 | Complete protection against dust and contact; protection against 30 minutes of water up to 1 meter of submersion |\n| Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra | IP68 | Complete protection against dust and contact; protection against continuous immersion in water up to depth specified by the manufacturer |\n| Sony Xperia 1 IV | IP68/IP65 | Complete protection against dust and contact; protection against continuous immersion in water up to depth specified by the manufacturer; protected against at least 3 minutes of water spraying from a 6.3mm nozzle from any direction |\n| Caterpillar CAT S61 | IP68/IP69 | Complete protection against dust and contact; protection against continuous immersion in water up to depth specified by the manufacturer; protection against continuous high-pressure, close-range jets of water from any direction \u2014 including high-temperature steam jets |\n| Pelican Marine (iPhone case) | IP68 | Complete protection against dust and contact; protection against continuous immersion in water up to depth specified by the manufacturer |\nFor an idea of how an IP certification is determined, take a look at this video of a test being conducted on behalf of electronics company Siemens. It ended up getting an IP67 rating \u2014 the same rating as the iPhone SE (2022) \u2014 which means it\u2019s been shown to withstand exposure both to objects and up to about 3 feet (or 1 meter) of water for 30 minutes.\nMilitary specifications and standards\nMilitary Specifications and Standards number in the hundreds and certify a product\u2019s ability to handle specific scenarios. For example, there are MIL-STD-810Gs that certify products to handle nuclear radiation exposure, drops onto concrete, rapid temperature changes, and a wide number of other environmental conditions.\n| Test Method 500.5 Low Pressure (Altitude) | Test Method 501.5 High Temperature | Test Method 502.5 Low Temperature |\n| Test Method 503.5 Temperature Shock | Test Method 504.1 Contamination by Fluids | Test Method 505.5 Solar Radiation (sunshine) |\n| Test Method 506.5 Rain | Test Method 507.5 Humidity | Test Method 508.6 Fungus |\n| Test Method 509.5 Salt Fog | Test Method 510.5 Sand and Dust | Test Method 511.5 Explosive Atmosphere |\n| Test Method 512.5 Immersion | Test Method 513.6 Acceleration | Test Method 514.6 Vibration |\n| Test Method 515.6 Acoustic Noise | Test Method 516.6 Shock | Test Method 517.1 Pyroshock |\n| Test Method 518.1 Acidic Atmosphere | Test Method 519.6 Gunfire Shock | Test Method 520.3 Temperature, Humidity, Vibration, and Altitude |\n| Test Method 521.3 Icing/Freezing Rain | Test Method 522.1 Ballistic Shock | Test Method 523.3 Vibro-Acoustic/Temperature |\n| Test Method 524 Freeze / Thaw | Test Method 525 Time Waveform Replication | Test Method 526 Rail Impact |\n| Test Method 526 Rail Impact | Test Method 527 Multi-Exciter | Test Method 528 Mechanical Vibrations of Shipboard Equipment (Type I \u2014 Environmental and Type II \u2014 Internally Excited) |\nMilitary Standards ratings comprise an exhaustive number of certifications, but there\u2019s a big problem: They aren\u2019t standardized. Manufacturers can conduct different tests and end up arriving at the same conclusion, which is partly the fault of the 810G system \u2014 it\u2019s meant to be flexible depending on the device being tested. But it makes it a little harder to know what to expect.\nTake the 810G\u2019s \u201ctemperature shock\u201d certification, for instance, which measures a device\u2019s ability to withstand fluctuating temperatures. The temperature range isn\u2019t defined, and neither is the amount of time, leaving plenty of wiggle room for a smartphone maker to claim that its handset is 810G-certified without having to explain what that really means.\nThe 810G\u2019s \u201csolar radiation\u201d standard is the same. Basically, any phone that can survive roughly three days of direct exposure to sunlight without becoming nonfunctional (or discolored) before, during, or after the test meets the device\u2019s requirements. That\u2019s not exactly the most useful measure.\nPerhaps the most common standard for rugged devices is MIL-STD-810G, which is an umbrella designation with a number of durability subcategories \u2014 namely protection against drops and falls. This pops up a lot on phone cases designed to offer drop protection, but military drop test standards vary depending on the tests that case manufacturers run on their rugged cases.\nMore than IP67\nFor devices like the iPhone SE, certification goes as far as dust, dirt, and 1 meter of water. But if you drop an iPhone SE onto concrete from 4 feet up, don\u2019t expect it to come out the other end unscathed.\nPerhaps more importantly, just because a phone has achieved a certain certification doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll hold up to abuse. Manufacturers conduct tests under lab conditions far different than the real-life scenarios you\u2019re likely to find yourself in. In one particularly egregious example, Sony sent marketing materials that showed the company\u2019s IP68-certified Xperia phones being used underwater \u2026 accompanied by a warning not to use them as depicted.\nThat\u2019s not to dismiss IP ratings and military certifications wholesale. As an informed consumer, you should absolutely find what ratings your device has before you buy it. But you should also take them with a grain of salt. No device is rugged in every way, and water, dust, and drop tests are conducted in labs \u2014 not the real world."

Why have I done this? Because the Galaxy Watch 7 doesn\u2019t deserve to be dismissed or mistakenly viewed solely as a \u201csmall\u201d update over the last models.\nLet\u2019s go into some detail about why it\u2019s another excellent Samsung smartwatch, so you don\u2019t get tricked into ignoring a great purchase.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: specs\n| Size | 40mm\n44mm |\n| Dimensions | 40.4mm x 40.4mm x 9.7mm (40mm)\n44.mm x 44.4mm x 9.7mm (44mm) |\n| Weight | 28.9 grams (40mm without band)\n33.8 grams (44mm without band) |\n| Colors | Green or cream (40mm)\nGreen or silver (44mm) |\n| Display | 1.3-inch Super AMOLED, 432 x 432 pixels (40mm)\n1.5-inch Super AMOLED, 480 x 480 pixels (44mm) |\n| Processor | Exynos W1000 1.6GHz, 2GB RAM |\n| Storage | 32GB |\n| Health and Fitness tracking | Optical heart rate sensor with ECG\nBioelectrical impedance analysis sensor Fall detection Dual-frequency GPS Accelerometer Barometer Gyro sensor Geomagnetic sensor Light sensor |\n| Battery Life | Up to 30 hours with always-on display |\n| Charging | 85 minutes using proprietary puck |\n| Price | $300 (40mm Wi-Fi)\n$350 (40mm 4G LTE) $330 (44mm Wi-Fi) $380 (44mm 4G LTE) |\nAbout our Galaxy Watch 7 review\nWe first published our Galaxy Watch 7 review at the beginning of August 2024, and it was based on wearing the 44mm version. We then revisited the review in mid-November 2024 after wearing the 40mm model, and there are some interesting differences between them that may affect your decision on which to buy. However, our overall score has not changed.\nYou can read our thoughts on the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 in the section below, and the review itself has been updated throughout to include any differences and updates since the smartwatch\u2019s release.\nSpending time with the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7\nRather than just returning to the same 44mm Galaxy Watch 7 a few months into its release, I tried out the 40mm model when updating our review instead, and it surprised me in terms of how comfortable and wearable it is. The specifications are no different outside of the screen and case size, so functionally, they\u2019re the same, but the 40mm model is undoubtedly more suited to my wrist than the larger 44mm one. The shape of the case, lugs, and strap flow together so well on the 40mm model, and the shorter strap is less cumbersome on my 6.5-inch wrist.\nCrucially, it doesn\u2019t look too small. This is a delicate balancing act, and one that few companies get right, but Samsung has expertly judged the dimensions, ensuring the watch doesn\u2019t get lost on your wrist. It\u2019s something Google failed to do with the first two Pixel Watch models.\nI don\u2019t think the 44mm Galaxy Watch 7 looks too big, backing up Samsung\u2019s decisions on the design. Having worn both, I would probably choose the 40mm version to wear long-term. It\u2019s more comfortable day-to-day and unnoticeable overnight if you want to track sleep. I certainly don\u2019t hate the 44mm model and still have a personal preference for large watches, but the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 just seems to fit better.\nDuring the rest of my time with the Galaxy Watch 7, I enjoyed its reliability and smooth operation, as well as its helpful features, such as accepting a call from your wrist. This also worked on a non-Samsung phone, which was nice to discover.\nUnfortunately, the battery life on the 40mm isn\u2019t any better than on the 44mm version, and software updates don\u2019t seem to have improved it. It lasts one day and one night, provided you don\u2019t use it too intensively during the day. This means you have to plan and remember to recharge it, otherwise you risk it running out of battery in the middle of the night. Battery life aside, the Galaxy Watch 7 is still one of the best smartwatches to come out this year. Now, I can genuinely recommend considering the smaller 40mm version, even if you usually buy the larger model.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: design and screen\nSeen or worn the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6? Then you\u2019ve seen and worn the Galaxy Watch 7, as there really aren\u2019t any major differences between the two. This isn\u2019t a terrible decision, as Samsung\u2019s smartwatch range needs some consistency, and settling on this established, very attractive design once again for the Watch 7 works really well. It comes in either 40mm or 44mm case sizes and in several different colors to provide just the right amount of choice.\nMy silver 44mm Watch 7 is attached to a new ribbed Sport Band in cream, with fabric highlights near the lugs. It has a one-click quick-release button underneath and a simple clasp to keep it on your wrist. It looks great, and I love the way it curves around the watch case to give a cool, integrated look.\nWhile it\u2019s generally very comfortable, it can get quite hot and sweaty. That\u2019s caused by the end of the band tucking underneath after the clasp, which can suddenly make the watch much tighter when your wrist gets warm. On some very hot nights in the U.K. recently (yes, they really can happen), the Watch 7 became too annoying to wear overnight because of this. The 40mm version comes with a shorter strap (but with the same level of adjustment) which avoids such issues on my 6.5-inch wrist.\nThe case has 5ATM water resistance and an IP68 dust and water resistance rating. It meets the MIL-STD-810H toughness standard for resisting shocks and enduring hard use, and it has sapphire crystal over the screen for scratch protection. While the Galaxy Watch Ultra has it beaten in a couple of areas, the Watch 7 will likely be more than durable enough for most people unless you\u2019re mountain climbing in freezing or boiling conditions.\nThe 40mm size has a 1.3-inch AMOLED screen, while the 44mm has a 1.5-inch AMOLED, the same as on the Galaxy Watch Ultra. I\u2019ve had no problem seeing it on very sunny days, but I probably still haven\u2019t seen its impressive 3,000 nits of maximum brightness. I find the ambient light sensor reactive and accurate to the conditions.\nIt\u2019s a bit of a crime that the Galaxy Watch 7\u2019s design hasn\u2019t become as iconic or recognizable as that of the Apple Watch, as it\u2019s not only more traditionally watch-like, but it\u2019s also very attractive on your wrist. It\u2019s one of the few other smartwatches I look down at and think how good it looks, especially in lighter colors. The silver case with the silver or cream Sport Band has just the right amount of attention-grabbing style without being as in your face as the orange or green bands. It looks excellent, it fits really well, there are plenty of personalization options, and it\u2019s certainly tougher than I am.\nI love the Galaxy Watch 7\u2019s style, except for one thing: the watch faces. They\u2019re almost all completely awful, and those that aren\u2019t have become a bit boring because I used them endlessly on the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. I\u2019ve used the new Spatial Number face, which is fine, though a bit garish, but at least it\u2019s not yet another dull dashboard and it doesn\u2019t make the Watch 7 look like a child\u2019s watch with an emoji on it. Iconic status will never be reached with watch faces like these, Samsung.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: health and fitness features\nSamsung\u2019s BioActive sensor on the back of the Galaxy Watch 7 has been upgraded with more LEDs, additional features, and new data points (some using AI) in the watch\u2019s software. There\u2019s also a dual-frequency GPS system for greater accuracy in difficult areas, making it the most advanced Watch model yet. All your data is collected over different Tiles on the watch, plus it connects to the Samsung Health app on your phone, where you\u2019ll find a dashboard with all your current stats.\nStarting and tracking a workout takes just a moment, and thankfully, so does stopping one, too. There are 90 varied workout options to choose from in the menu, but I couldn\u2019t find a fast way to lock the screen, meaning the side buttons can be accidentally pressed when your wrist is flexed. It has competently tracked my workouts and does record a higher calorie burn compared to my Oura Ring and the Apple Watch Series 9, but the average heart rate is within a few beats of both of those devices. The Galaxy Watch Ultra recorded a similar calorie burn to the Apple Watch Ultra 2 in a separate test.\nSleep tracking is excellent, with results appearing immediately on your watch and the Sleep Score appearing on the Tile, giving you the most important data at a glance. Weirdly, the Sleep Tile doesn\u2019t show heart rate variability, but it does show up under the new Energy Score Tile. Much like the Oura Ring\u2019s Readiness Score, the Energy Score is a way to assess how prepared your body is for the day and how hard you should push yourself during any exercise. It\u2019s such a simple to understand, generally informative metric that I recommend moving the Tile to a prominent position on your watch to get the most benefit from it.\nSleep tracking is excellent.\nThis is less applicable to the Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) Index metric now included in the Samsung Health app. It\u2019s supposed to help you understand metabolic health and how your body is aging, which is somewhat vague in itself, but there are question marks over whether it\u2019s accurate or if it even shows anything of value at all. I certainly haven\u2019t gained anything from it. The electrocardiogram feature is similar in that only a few people will have a need to use it. The body composition reading may help show changes in your body over time, and it\u2019s a nice addition that\u2019s usually only found on smart scales. It\u2019s not new, though, and has been on various Galaxy Watch models before.\nWhat I like about the Galaxy Watch 7\u2019s health and fitness tracking is the depth of data for different workouts, the speed with which it presents it, and the additional features that are inside the app. If you want training plans, they\u2019re available. If you want the Watch 7 to help improve your sleep, there are plans for that too. And it\u2019s one of the only smartwatches to have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for sleep apnea detection. Even the Samsung Health app is laid out well, and contains everything from cycle tracking to a way to measure daily water intake.\nBest of all, Samsung Health is free, with no subscription to pay. Furthermore, if you wear a Samsung Galaxy Ring with your Galaxy Watch 7, then not only does the smartwatch\u2019s battery life improve, but Samsung Health uses the sensors in both to improve accuracy. The Galaxy Watch 7 is an all-around superb health and activity tracking package with few downsides. Just be aware that some features, such as sleep apnea detection and fall detection, are only available when you use a Samsung smartphone.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: software and performance\nThe software on the Galaxy Watch 7 is the fastest and smoothest I\u2019ve used on any Galaxy Watch yet, showing the power of the new 3nm Exynos W1000 processor and Samsung\u2019s refinements to One UI Watch. It\u2019s a simple layout, and the gestures used to control the software are easy to learn and remember. There\u2019s no physical rotating bezel like on the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, but there is a helpful virtual one so you can move quickly through Tiles and the menu.\nThe software on the Galaxy Watch 7 is the fastest and smoothest I\u2019ve used on any Galaxy Watch.\nHowever, the Galaxy Watch 7\u2019s notification system is irritating. I\u2019ve had it connected to a Galaxy Z Flip 6, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and the HMD Skyline at different points, and the Watch 7 only showed notifications, but didn\u2019t alert me. I missed them entirely at first and then was fooled into thinking everything was working because the stand reminder vibration worked. But it turns out that the smartwatch defaults to a Mute mode, and you need to change this to Vibrate or Sound if you want to actually know when alerts arrive.\nSilly me, obviously, but my overanalysis of the problem comes from the multiple apps, menus, and settings required to make notifications work in the first place, and all of it is off-putting and needlessly complicated. The Apple Watch doesn\u2019t need any changes to be made, and it works faultlessly from the start. I really expected the same from the Galaxy Watch 7 and a new Galaxy phone, but that\u2019s not the case at all. Wear OS has never been good at notifications, and it\u2019s still terribly unreliable here.\nIt\u2019s not just notifications that are too complex, as setting the watch up for sleep is an equally step-filled pain, and I don\u2019t trust the system not to throw an unexpected mode into the mix that wakes me up in the middle of the night. That said, swapping between phones is much easier than it was before. Samsung\u2019s Cloud works for smartwatches and Samsung Health backups, and it takes just a few minutes to pair the Watch 7 with a different phone. It\u2019s a complicated process that may not be needed very often, so it\u2019s great to see it has been simplified.\nSo as not to be outdone by Apple, the Galaxy Watch 7 has a \u201cdouble pinch\u201d gesture that can be used to dismiss notifications, answer calls, control music, and as a remote camera shutter release. It\u2019s just as accurate as the same gesture on the Apple Watch, and I like how it controls the camera, too. The Watch 7\u2019s camera preview, in general, rivals the Apple Watch\u2019s similar system. There are also some Galaxy AI features to play with, such as suggested replies and voice-to-text summaries in the messaging app. Just be aware that they require a Samsung phone to operate.\nSamsung\u2019s new processor and refined One UI software makes the Galaxy Watch 7 a pleasure to use most of the time, but Google\u2019s Wear OS (version 5, in its debut here) is the rusty cog, with the same old problems showing up even after years of updates. It needs careful setting up and attention paid to different menus and settings on the watch and phone if you want it to be a competent, reliable partner.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: battery and charging\nThe Galaxy Watch 7\u2019s battery life has been inconsistent, and even when it\u2019s working at its \u201cbest,\u201d it\u2019s not very impressive. When I started using it, a single night of sleep tracking and one short workout would see the battery ready to expire by the end of the day. This was using the always-on screen and all-day health-tracking features. You could turn all these things off and the battery will last longer, but then what\u2019s the point of wearing it?\nA software update arrived during my time with the smartwatch, promising some battery-related changes, and it does seem to have slightly improved overall usage time. When I first started wearing it, it took a while for the battery to settle down into everyday life, with the first week showing considerable battery drain from things like sleep tracking, which saw 20% of battery disappear overnight.\nNow that it has gotten to know me and the latest software update has been installed, sleep tracking takes around 10% of the battery each night. A 30-minute workout with GPS takes about 6% of the battery. Even with the update, there\u2019s never much left in reserve for the battery to last much more than a day, but with the battery saver mode active, you could stretch it out if necessary.\nWhen I returned to the Galaxy Watch 7 several months after release, I didn\u2019t find the battery life had improved. The 40mm model\u2019s battery lasts for one day and one night, if you want to track sleep, and this is with a single, short workout tracked too. Expect it to require charging first thing in the morning when used like this. Recharging is performed using an included proprietary puck, and it takes 85 minutes to fully charge the battery from zero.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: price and availability\nThe cheapest Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is the 40mm version at $300, while the basic 44mm model costs $330. You can add LTE connectivity to both sizes of Galaxy Watch 7 models, and the feature costs an additional $50 on top of the basic price. There are no additional charges for different bands during purchase, and you can choose between the Sport Band seen in our photos, two different fabric bands, or a metal Milanese Band.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that to get the full benefit from the Galaxy Watch 7\u2019s features, you should use a Galaxy smartphone, but the smartwatch still works with non-Samsung Android phones, just with a few feature caveats. Samsung\u2019s main competition comes in the shape of the Google Pixel Watch 3, the Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5, Pro 5 Enduro, and the TicWatch Atlas, which are the best choices to make if you want long battery life.\nFor some slightly less obvious alternatives, take a look at the Xiaomi Watch S3 and the CMF by Nothing Watch Pro 2, both of which have fun customization features and cost a lot less than the Galaxy Watch 7. If you own a Galaxy Watch 6, Watch 6 Classic, Galaxy Watch 5, or a Watch 5 Pro, there isn\u2019t any reason to upgrade. If you own an iPhone, the Galaxy Watch 7 does not work with it, and you should buy an Apple Watch instead.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: verdict\nFaster, smoother, brighter, and more intelligent than before, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is a brilliant smartwatch. Yes, it looks the same as the Galaxy Watch 6, but if that bothers you, then you\u2019re missing the fact that it\u2019s an excellent design already and doesn\u2019t need to change. Great design comes from continuity, and Samsung has rightly only updated the bands and colors here. What\u2019s more important is that the technology inside has been refined and improved, making it a better product to own and use.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is a brilliant smartwatch.\nGoogle\u2019s Wear OS is still problematic (and I don\u2019t see that changing), you do need a Samsung phone to get the very best from it, and the battery life is far too short, but look past these downsides and you\u2019ll find little else wrong with the Galaxy Watch 7. Samsung is waving and pointing at the Galaxy Watch Ultra as the smartwatch it wants you to buy this year, but don\u2019t be swayed. You get practically everything it does in a more wearable case for a lot less money if you choose the Galaxy Watch 7 instead."

Top brands like Garmin, Apple, Google, and Samsung pretty much always have numerous smartwatch models discounted across retailers. Big brands like these are, of course, the most popular among shoppers, so we make a point of including at least one model from each of these in our selections for the best smartwatch deals.\nSmartwatches, really, are some of the most discounted pieces of tech you can find out there. Those top brands mentioned above generally keep older generations of their smartwatches on the market alongside their new releases, and that opens up all sorts of room for smartwatch deals. Smartwatches such as the Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 8, Samsung Galaxy Watch 5, and numerous Fitbit models are at least a generation old and the perfect candidates to see some major discounts. They\u2019re also regulars among the best smartwatch deals.\nAnd while pricing and availability are the two most important factors when we choose the best smartwatch deals, style is something we consider as well. Some people are looking for a smartwatch to look good, while others are in the market for something to help with their fitness routine. Brands recognize this and tailor certain smartwatch models to each. When we make our selections for the best smartwatch deals we try to keep a nice balance between the two and provide a number of discounted smartwatches for different tastes."

      "text": "Samsung has already put AI into your Galaxy smartphone, and its next move is to put it inside your Galaxy smartwatch too. The company will introduce Galaxy AI features to the Galaxy Watch range with the One UI 6 Watch update coming in the near future. The benefits all center around health and fitness.\nGalaxy AI on wearables will also be part of the Samsung Health app, which is used to keep track of your health, fitness, sleep, and daily activity. What features will it include? At this stage, the company has detailed six key advancements using Galaxy AI in Samsung Health and One UI 6 Watch.\nPerhaps the most notable is an Energy Score, which will use daily statistics from your sleep, activity, and heart rate to increase understanding of your current condition. It sounds a lot like the Readiness Score on the Oura Ring, or Garmin\u2019s Body Battery, just with added AI smarts. Expect Galaxy AI to also help you improve through Wellness Tips, which apparently will provide insights into your condition, show motivational advice, and allow custom goals to be set up.\nSamsung improved its sleep tracking with the Galaxy Watch 6, and Galaxy AI will closely analyze heart and respiratory rate, plus movement and sleep latency, to help you achieve even better sleep over time. During workouts, Galaxy AI will provide a new Personalized Health Rate Zone with enhanced aerobic and anaerobic threshold data, the chance to combine exercises together for a personalized routine, and a Race mode to track progress against previous sessions when running or cycling.\nSamsung states it will release One UI 6 Watch later this year, but a beta version will be made available to some Galaxy Watch owners in June. While Samsung is currently talking about Galaxy AI and One UI 6 Watch for its smartwatches, it\u2019s highly likely that at least some of the new features will also apply to the forthcoming Galaxy Ring smart ring. If it\u2019s to take on the Oura Ring, currently the best smart ring you can buy, Samsung knows it needs to push the app and data beyond what\u2019s offered by it, and AI may help it do so.\nThere are no specific dates mentioned by Samsung about One UI 6 Watch or Galaxy AI for wearables. However, rumors point to a Galaxy Unpacked event taking place in July, and we may see the Galaxy Watch 7 range and the Galaxy Ring fully revealed there, and these new software features with them."

The Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch are top devices that enhance health tracking and connectivity.\nSmartwatches also serve as fashion accessories, making personal style a key factor in choosing a device. The Apple Watch Series 10 remains the best option for iPhone users, while Android fans can turn to the OnePlus Watch 3, Pixel Watch 3 or Samsung's Galaxy Watch 7, which offers improved performance and health insights.\nOther options include OnePlus\u2019s Wear OS smartwatches with excellent battery life, Garmin\u2019s fitness-focused wearables, and luxury offerings from Tag Heuer.

That may not sound like a lot, but it adds up for a device you're wearing on your wrist all day. The premium finish also moves from stainless steel to titanium for an even greater reduction in weight. It's also available in a stunning new glossy Jet Black finish.\nThe screen size has grown by 2mm to 3mm in each direction, a subtle increase that's enough to give you an extra line of text for notifications and apps like Mail and News. However, the bigger improvement is the LTPO3 wide-angle OLED display. While the overall maximum brightness remains at 2,000 nits, the new display technology makes better use of that brightness, promising 40% more when looked at from off-axis angles. That's a noticeable benefit for a watch, since you're rarely looking at it straight-on.\nAs usual, the Apple Watch Series 10 packs a full array of body sensors, and watchOS 11 adds sleep apnea notifications to the mix of health conditions that the Apple Watch can help you detec. Apple makes it clear that it's still no substitute for a professional diagnosis, merely a cue to suggest it might be a good idea to see a doctor. Sadly, an ongoing patent battle in the U.S. has resulted in one of the key sensors being disabled; the blood oxygen sensor is still technically there, but it won't work on any new Apple Watch purchased in the U.S. until the patent dispute is settled or the patents in question expire in 2028. Thankfully, the new sleep apnea feature doesn't rely on this \u2014 it uses the accelerometer and some clever advanced machine learning algorithms instead. Plus, this will only be an issue if you're buying your Apple Watch in the U.S.; it's business as usual in other countries like Canada.\nIn addition to the usual heart rate, electrocardiogram, body temperature, and motion sensors, the Apple Watch also features fall and crash detection to notify emergency services in the event you've had an accident. Fall Detection has been around since the Series 4, and Crash Detection came to the Series 8, and both have proven themselves remarkably effective at saving lives, helping people get rescued even when unconscious.\nWhile the S10 chip in the Apple Watch Series 10 appears to be little more than a repackaged version of the S9 chip, that's not a problem as that was already the fastest smartwatch chip on the market by a healthy margin. It's enabled features like Double Tap, which lets you dismiss alarms, answer calls, and even scroll through notifications and the Smart Stack just by double-tapping your index finger and thumb together. It also now processes Siri requests on-device, improving response time and privacy and letting you make queries and update health information with your voice.\nThere's also no shortage of workouts for fitness buffs to track. The Series 10 brings over the depth gauge from the Apple Watch Ultra to support shallow-water activities. This included Depth app will activate automatically when submerged to give you water temperature and depth readings up to 6 meters (20 feet). It's not rated for recreational scuba diving like the Ultra, but it's a nice touch for folks that enjoy snorkeling or diving. The new Tides app in watchOS 11 also lets you check the current and forecasted conditions at any one of over 100,000 beaches worldwide so you can be prepared for your next watery adventure.\nThere's ample battery life for a full day's use, and even faster charging lets you top it up to 80% in 30 minutes, and to a full charge in about an hour. Most folks will be able to pop it on the charger while taking their morning shower and be ready to head out the door with a full charge, even after a full night of sleep tracking.\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 comes in two sizes, which have grown to 42mm and 46mm. However, as with past models, both remain compatible with the hundreds of bands that have been made for every model since the original 2015 Series 0. The standard aluminum model is available in both GPS (Wi-Fi only) and GPS + Cellular (LTE) versions, while all of the higher-end titanium versions include LTE support.\nThe best smartwatch for Android\nGoogle Pixel Watch 3\n- It finally comes in a bigger size!\n- Gorgeous, well-made hardware\n- Smaller bezels, more display\n- Well over 24-hour battery life\n- Excellent running features\n- Robust health tracking\n- Reliable and easy-to-use software\n- Underside scratches easily\n- Some Fitbit features require a subscription\n| Specification: | |\n| Case size | 41mm 45mm |\n| Compatibility | Any phone running Android 10 or newer |\n| Operating system | Wear OS 5.0 |\n| Battery life | 36 hours |\nWhy you should buy this: It's simply one of the most well-rounded Wear OS smartwatch on the market.\nWho it's for: Android phone owners who own a Pixel watch and also want the best smartwatch available.\nWhy we picked the Google Pixel Watch 3: Google may have come late to the smartwatch game, but it's made up for lost time pretty quickly. After a weak initial start, Google quickly refined its designs and technology, leading to the Google Pixel Watch 3 joining the cream of the crop of Android smartwatches.\nThe Google Pixel Watch 3 is as close to a \"Goldilocks\" smartwatch as any we've seen. It combines a solid build with an attractive design, an excellent display, strong battery life, and sophisticated health and fitness features \u2014 and it does it all at a remarkably affordable price. It's what we hoped the original Pixel Watch would be, and we're thrilled to see that it's only taken Google three iterations to hit that sweet spot.\nThe Pixel Watch 3 has finally grown up in more ways than one. The first two generations were limited to a smaller 41mm size, which left many folks giving it a pass as it was less readable than most of its competitors and looked awkwardly toylike on larger wrists. This model finally adds a 45mm body to the mix. The design remains unchanged otherwise, but it's remarkably minimalist. Google has gone for a tech-forward look similar to the Apple Watch, but with a round design that's all its own. It's not for everyone, but we think the more modern aesthetic is sleek and subtle. It's also more durable than it looks, thanks to Gorilla Glass 5 on the display and the same IP68 and 5ATM ratings of its flagship competitors.\nThe display also gets reduced bezels, which, when combined with the 45mm screen, lets you see a lot more information at a glance. Google has improved the brightness to the 2,000-nit level that we've come to expect on a modern smartwatch, so you'll have no problem seeing it outdoors on even the sunniest days, yet it also drops to a single nit so you won't be blinded when you need to check the time in the middle of the night.\nWhen it comes to health and fitness, the Pixel Watch 3 retains its identity as a glorified Fitbit, but in this case, we'd say you're selling it short if you see it as nothing more than that. It still uses the Fitbit app, so you have to be comfortable with the way it tracks data like steps and floors, but Google has taken things to a new level with powerful new Cardio Load and Readiness health metrics that should deliver deeper insights into your health and fitness. On the surface, these translate into simple numerical ratings to help you easily know where you stand \u2014 Cardio Load for workout intensity and Readiness for your general health \u2014 and how ready you are to face the day based on factors like heart rate and sleep. We found both those scores to be remarkably accurate, lining up with similar metrics we get from other smartwatches and even smart rings like the Oura Ring.\nRunners will also appreciate a new set of features, such as alerts for intervals, splits and real-time coaching based on your goals, and AI-powered running recommendations. While Google's suite of running features doesn't necessarily exceed what Apple and Samsung offer, they're well-thought-out and put the Pixel Watch 3 on par with its competitors. The only catch? You'll still need a Fitbit Premium subscription to get the most out of these, as most of the AI-powered recommendations and things like detailed sleep tracking are locked behind that paywall. Basic health and fitness tracking is still free, and the $10 monthly or $80 annual price tag isn't too bad, but it's still disappointing that Google feels the need to charge for features that its biggest rivals include in the purchase price.\nThe Pixel Watch 3 gets excellent battery life that exceeds its manufacturer's claims. Google promises 24 hours on a single charge, but in our experience, it lands closer to 36 hours of normal use. The Pixel Watch 3 appears to have borrowed a page from OnePlus here with a hybrid approach that uses a Cortex M33 coprocessor to take the load off the more power-hungry Snapdragon W5 chip for routine background tasks, making much better use of the battery. It also has fast charging, getting back up to 100% in about an hour.\nThe Pixel Watch 3 isn't just for Google Pixel users; it's the best smartwatch for most folks no matter which Android phone you're using. You won't find a better smartwatch without switching to an iPhone. While other smartwatches may serve those with more specific needs, the Pixel Watch 3 is the best of all worlds, checking every box to create an incredibly well-rounded package that won't disappoint.\nThe best runner-up smartwatch for Android\nOnePlus Watch 3\n- Classy design\n- High quality materials\n- Fantastic performance\n- Long battery life\n- Comprehensive health and fitness features\n- Only one size available\n- Cheap, awkward charging puck\n| Specification: | |\n| Case size | 47.6mm |\n| Compatibility | Android |\n| Operating system | Wear OS + RTOS |\n| Battery life | Up to 5 days between charges |\nWhy you should buy this: It's one of the best smartwatches for Android users.\nWho it's for: Android phone owners who want the best smartwatch available and don't care about spending more\nWhy we picked the OnePlus Watch 3:\nThe OnePlus Watch 3 is an appealing option for Android users looking for a feature-rich smartwatch. Its sleek, circular design offers a classic look, while the vibrant AMOLED display ensures excellent visibility. A notable strength of this watch is its dual-processor system, which combines Wear OS for smart features with RTOS for extended battery life. It can last up to five days in smart mode and even longer in power saver mode.\nThis watch was our favorite smartwatch for Android users. Unfortunately, rising prices because of tariff issues has dropped this to the runner-up position.\nFitness enthusiasts will appreciate the comprehensive suite of health and activity tracking features, which includes heart rate monitoring, SpO2 measurement, sleep tracking, and various workout modes. Additionally, the seamless integration with the OnePlus ecosystem, along with helpful features like notifications, music control, and built-in GPS, enhances the overall user experience.\nIf you value a blend of style, functionality, and battery performance in an Android-compatible smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3 is definitely worth considering.\nThe best budget smartwatch for Android\nOnePlus Watch 2R\n- Rugged, durable design\n- Easily replaceable watch bands\n- Fluid interface with Wear OS\n- Exceptional battery life and charging\n- No features locked to OnePlus phones\n- Average looks\n- Unimpressive health features\n- No backup and restore via cloud\n| Specification: | |\n| Case size | 46mm |\n| Compatibility | Phones running Android 8 or later |\n| Operating system | Wear OS 4 |\n| Battery life | 48 hours (heavy use in Smart mode) 100 hours (Smart Mode) |\nWhy you should buy this: It's a very affordable smartwatch that delivers good bang for your buck and incredible battery life.\nWho it's for: Anyone who wants a Wear OS smartwatch that can run for days between charges.\nWhy we picked the OnePlus Watch 2R: OnePlus has been on a roll lately when it comes to its more affordable \"R\" series products, and the Watch 2R is no exception. The OnePlus 12R is possibly the best value Android smartphone out there, and OnePlus' budget smartwatch follows in its footsteps while continuing to excel in the area that OnePlus is best known for: exceptionally fast charging and long battery life.\nLike most Wear OS smartwatches, the OnePlus Watch 12R can pair with any Android smartphone that meets the minimum requirements \u2014 which are a pretty low bar at Android 8.0 or later. However, it's unique in that you don't get any special advantages at all to using it with a OnePlus phone; it works just as well with a Google Pixel 9 or Samsung Galaxy S24 FE.\nThat's arguably because it doesn't offer all the sophisticated features of more advanced smartwatches, but we think what it does provide is perfectly reasonable for its $230 asking price. You're getting the same Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chip as its more expensive sibling, the OnePlus Watch 2, which means the performance is snappy and lag-free. OnePlus has also baked in the proprietary RTOS operating system of its earlier smartwatches to provide a low-power mode that sips battery. You'll lose Wear OS functionality and most health-tracking features will stop, but it can extend your battery for nearly two weeks between charges.\nHowever, you don't need to fall back on the low-power mode to get great battery life. We had to charge it once during the five days that we reviewed it, which is a runtime that most competing smart watches can only dream of. You'll also be able to fully charge it up in under an hour, and the charging puck is unique in offering a detachable USB-C cable, making it easier to travel with.\nSo, what's the biggest downside to this budget smartwatch? You won't get the robust health-tracking features of more premium models. There's a generous assortment of workouts, with basic stats like heart rate, distance, calories burned, and VO2 max, plus blood oxygen sensing and sleep tracking. However, you don't get an electrocardiogram sensor, skin temperature sensor, or more sophisticated body composition analysis features. Our testing has also left us with concerns about OnePlus' dubious accuracy compared to other smartwatches. None of those are deal-breakers for a $230 smartwatch as long as you're going into it with your eyes open.\nThese drawbacks are also largely irrelevant if health features aren't your priority. The OnePlus Watch 2R provides excellent battery life, solid performance, plenty of onboard storage, and an enjoyable Wear OS experience that makes it an ideal pick for someone who primarily wants a smartwatch for basic workout tracking and more traditional features like notifications, customizable watch faces, apps, and music.\nThe best premium smartwatch for the iPhone\nApple Watch Ultra 2\n- Titanium design is still gorgeous\n- Stunning, super bright display\n- Unmatched performance\n- Siri is better than ever\n- Twice as much storage\n- Excellent battery life\n- WatchOS 10 is fantastic\n- Double Tap is underutilized\n- Virtually identical to last year's model\n| Specification: | |\n| Case size | 49mm |\n| Compatibility | iPhone XS or later |\n| Operating system | Watch OS |\n| Battery life | 36 hours (normal use) 72 hours (Low Power Mode) |\nWhy you should buy this: It's the ultimate smartwatch for the iPhone, and astonishingly capable too.\nWho it's for: Adventurers, divers, hikers, runners, and anyone who wants a no-compromise, statement-making smartwatch on their wrist.\nWhy we picked the Apple Watch Ultra 2: Apple may promote the Apple Watch Ultra 2 as an adventure smartwatch, suitable mostly for those who enjoy all kinds of outdoor pursuits. But if that\u2019s not you, don\u2019t ignore this superb smartwatch. It does everything the Apple Watch Series 9 does, with a 49mm titanium case, sapphire crystal over the screen, ceramic on the case back, and a battery that can last multiple days on a single charge. It\u2019s big, tough, and bold, but also supremely capable. While Apple skipped a significant update for the Ultra in 2024, it did add a sleek new dark titanium finish that looks gorgeous and should appeal for folks who weren't fans of the more natural metallic look.\nLike the Apple Watch Series 9, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 has the S9 chip, which allows for on-device Siri processing, with no data connection required. It also has the new Double Tap gesture, allowing you to perform certain actions on the watch using your index finger and thumb, offers Precision Finding with the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16, and supports the latest new watchOS 11 features like Double Tap improvements and sleep apnea notifications.\nWhat does it do beyond the Series 10? The screen is bigger and brighter (it reaches up to 3,000 nits peak brightness), there\u2019s the customizable orange Action button on the side of the case, LTE comes as standard, it has an emergency alert siren to attract attention, and it\u2019s suitable for dive use. The Low Power battery mode extends use to more than 60 hours, the case meets MIL-STD-810H standards and is IPX8 dust resistant, and the watch has a 100-meter water resistance too. It comes with your choice of unique Ultra band, designed to suit your activity of choice, but works with any Apple Watch strap too. Plus, don't let the Series 10's new S10 chip fool you, as it's basically just a repackaged version of the S9, which means you'll get the same performance.\nThe biggest catch with the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for buyers in the U.S. is that you'll no longer get the blood oxygen sensor. In January, Apple was forced to disable it due to an ongoing patent dispute, and there's no sign that will be resolved anytime soon. This doesn't affect anyone who bought an Apple Watch Ultra 2, before the ban took effect, and it also doesn't apply to models sold in Canada and other countries, but if you buy a new Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the U.S., you'll be missing that feature.\nNevertheless, all the other features are well-thought-out, right down to the design and choice of materials, and while it's still twice the price of the Series 10 and has otherwise very similar functionality, there\u2019s something unique about the Ultra 2. It has some character to it, and that\u2019s rare to find in a smartwatch. Most people will be fine owning the Series 10, which is more wearable overnight, but if you\u2019re tempted by the Ultra and think you\u2019d make use of its adventurous credentials, we say go for it. You won\u2019t be disappointed by this very special smartwatch.\nBest smartwatch for Samsung phones\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7\n- Attractive, enduring design\n- Choice of size, color, and band\n- Fast processor\n- Bright, clear screen\n- All the durability you need\n- One-day battery life\n- Slow charging\n- Some features require a Samsung phone\n| Specification: | |\n| Case size | 40mm 44mm |\n| Compatibility | Samsung Galaxy smartphone running Android 11 or later |\n| Operating system | Tizen |\n| Battery life | Up to 30 hours with always-on display |\nWhy you should buy this: Fast performance, Wear OS 5, and sophisticated health features make this one of the best smartwatches on the market, especially for Samsung users.\nWho it's for: Anyone who wants a proven design with some of the most comprehensive health features available on a smartwatch today.\nWhy we picked the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: While the Galaxy Watch 7 may look the same as 2023's Galaxy Watch 6 on the outside, Samsung has made some impressive changes under the hood to beef up performance and bring its staple health-tracking feature to new heights.\nFirst up, it gets a new 3nm Exynos W1000 processor that delivers true, lag-free performance and ensures that notifications come through without hesitation. Navigation is buttery smooth, and apps open almost instantly. It's a threefold boost in performance over the Exynos W930 used in the Galaxy Watch 6, and it makes a noticeable difference.\nSamsung has used that extra horsepower to make the Galaxy Watch 7 the first smartwatch to introduce sleep apnea monitoring, beating Apple to the punch by about two months. As Samsung explains, this allows the latest Galaxy Watch models to \"detect signs of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea over a two-night monitoring period.\" As with Apple's implementation, it's no substitute for a professional medical diagnosis, but it's a good way of alerting users to a potential condition that goes undetected in many people.\nBeyond that, Samsung offers the stable of health and fitness features that its smartwatches are known for, including an improved BioActive Sensor that should deliver even more accurate readings for metrics like heart rate, muscle and fat mass, body water, body fat, and basal metabolic rate (BMR). And its bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) provides a more comprehensive profile of your body composition, such as fat and muscle mass. The result is a more holistic view of your health than many other smartwatch platforms offer.\nAlong those same lines, Samsung has brought Galaxy AI into the mix to analyze your sleep, activity, heart rate, and more to deliver a new Energy Score metric that gives you greater insight into your health and offers recommendations and coaching on how to improve it.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the Galaxy Watch 7 is the best smartwatch to buy if you have a Samsung smartphone. It's a brilliant smartwatch that sticks with an established and proven design and ramps things up significantly under the hood with new levels of performance and an even stronger focus on providing a deeper and more comprehensive view of your health. The only marks against it are that you'll need a Samsung smartphone to get the most from it, and the battery life isn't as impressive as we'd hoped. However, that last part just means you'll have to charge it at least once a day, but we think that trade-off is worth it given everything else the Galaxy Watch 7 offers.\nThe best premium smartwatch for Android\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\n- Rotating bezel\n- A choice of case size\n- Supreme 24/7 comfort\n- High quality materials\n- Comprehensive health and fitness tracking\n- Spotty notification reliability\n- Performance doesn't always impress\n| Specification: | |\n| Case size | 43mm 47mm |\n| Compatibility | Smartphones running Android 8 or later |\n| Operating system | Android |\n| Battery life | 30 hours (with always-on display) 40 (without always on display) |\nWhy you should buy this: It's incredibly comfortable, looks great, and is made from high-quality materials.\nWho it's for: An Android user who wants a premium smartwatch with a unique design and has no problem paying more to get it.\nWhy we picked the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic: The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic was released as a more expensive companion to the Galaxy Watch 6, and it still fills that spot, even alongside the more powerful Galaxy Watch 7.\nWhile the Galaxy Watch Ultra is another option if you're willing to spend even more, that design isn't for everyone. The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is the better option for those who want a Samsung smartwatch with a more sophisticated style.\nPlus, even though the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic may seem like it's now almost two years behind, it's gotten Wear OS 5, which should put it on par with the Galaxy Watch 7 in terms of software features.\nWhat makes the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic remain a worthwhile buy is its elegant design that looks as close to a classic watch design as you'll find among flagship smartwatches. From the classy stainless steel case and sapphire crystal glass display to the rotating bezel and leather strap, it's as much a fashion statement as a smartwatch. Plus, WearOS 5 has arrived, which means you can access a much broader range of attractive watch faces to complement its style.\nDon't let its looks fool you, though, as it doesn't pull any punches on features. You get solid battery life that actually beats out the Galaxy Watch 7, plus all of Samsung's great health- and fitness-tracking features, from the BioActive Sensor that tracks your heart rate, body temperature, and blood oxygen levels to the bioelectrical impedance analysis that will give you insights into your body composition.\nThe Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is the smartwatch to buy if you want the Samsung health and Wear OS experience in style. With a gorgeous high-quality build, a rotating bezel, and a much larger screen, it's one of the best premium smartwatches for Android phones.\nThe best dual-screen smartwatch\nMobvoi TicWatch Pro 5\n- Clever dual-screen system\n- Four-day battery life\n- Highest-performance smartwatch\n- Clean and reliable software\n- Quality haptic feedback\n- One size and color only\n- No cellular option\n- Fitness-tracking bug requires fixing\n| Specification: | |\n| Case size | 50mm |\n| Compatibility | Android 8 or later |\n| Operating system | Wear OS 3 |\n| Battery life | Up to 80 hours |\nWhy you should buy this: The latest chip, four-day battery life, and slick software make this a truly excellent smartwatch.\nWho it's for: Anyone who wants the best dual-screen tech and the longest battery life from their smartwatch.\nWhy we picked the Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5: The Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 is going to cost you $350, but it\u2019s worth the additional cost over what you\u2019d spend on the basic $300 Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 if you want a dual-screen watch with great battery life. It\u2019s one of the fastest, smoothest-performing Android smartwatches we\u2019ve used, and it returns battery life most others cannot come close to matching.\nMobvoi's clever dual-screen layout is the star here. In this clever feature, a standard OLED screen is overlaid by a different panel used solely for always-on duties. It\u2019s more useful than on previous TicWatch models, showing additional information outside of just the time and date, and it's instrumental in making the battery last as long as it does. It requires no effort to use, but is hugely beneficial.\nInside the TicWatch Pro 5 is the Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 processor. It\u2019s the first smartwatch to feature the chip, and it\u2019s a seriously impressive performer. Wear OS 3.5 is very fast and super smooth, banishing the memory of so many poor-performing Android smartwatches from the past. It\u2019s seemingly efficient, too -- when paired with the dual-screen layout, the TicWatch Pro 5\u2019s battery lasts for around four days before it needs recharging.\nTo get this truly premium smartwatch experience, you\u2019ll have to put up with the TicWatch Pro 5\u2019s size. It has a 46mm case, and that\u2019s the only size available. The design is slick, but it only comes in black and on a silicone strap, so there\u2019s not much room for personalization here. It is durable, though, with MIL-STD-810G toughness and water resistance.\nThe Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 is a technical powerhouse. It shows off Wear OS better than any other smartwatch, and it has battery life that makes other models blush. If you value materials like sapphire crystal on your premium smartwatch over power and specs, then take a look at the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic instead.\nThe best hybrid smartwatch\nWithings ScanWatch 2\n- Beautiful design\n- Comprehensive health monitoring\n- FDA approved for atrial fibrillation\n- 38mm or 42mm case sizes\n- Long battery life\n- Unreliable notifications\n- Subscription needed to unlock features\n- App design can frustrate\n| Specification: | |\n| Case size | 38mm 42mm |\n| Compatibility | iOS 16 or later Android 12 or later |\n| Operating system | Unknown |\n| Battery life | 30 days |\nWhy you should buy this: It's the ideal mix of good watch design and fitness-tracking technology.\nWho it's for: Anyone who doesn't want their smartwatch to look too techy, but isn't willing to compromise on health and fitness tracking.\nWhy we picked the Withings ScanWatch 2: A hybrid smartwatch is one that looks more like a traditional watch with analog hands and no touchscreen, but still includes all the smart connected features and health tracking we love about more techy models. The Withings ScanWatch 2 fits the bill perfectly, with its classy stainless steel case and sapphire crystal, plus an almost hidden OLED screen showing all the information you need.\nOn the back is a heart rate sensor and body temperature monitor, plus the ScanWatch 2 separates itself from other smartwatches by having Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its atrial fibrillation detection. It also tracks your workouts, measures blood oxygen levels and body temperature during exercise, and a lot more. It\u2019s also an excellent sleep tracker, with masses of data available.\nThe lack of a touchscreen means the battery has less work to do, and should last for about two weeks on a single charge when you use all the features (or longer if some are inactive). The app is informative, but not all that well laid out, and there are a lot of niche features \u2014 plus an unwelcome subscription to pay if you want more. Otherwise, the ScanWatch 2 is a superb choice if a full touchscreen smartwatch doesn\u2019t appeal to you.\nAlternatively, if the design isn\u2019t sporty enough, the Garmin Vivomove Trend may be more suitable, and we love its cool looks and hidden screen, along with Garmin\u2019s excellent health and fitness platform. Failing that, Casio\u2019s connected G-Shock watches like the GPR-H1000 Rangeman and the GBD-H2000 are both excellent too.\nThe best luxury smartwatch\nTag Heuer Connected Calibre E4\n- Tag Heuer Sports app is excellent\n- Luxury sapphire, ceramic, and steel build\n- Sharp, high-resolution screen\n- 42mm size suitable for most people\n- No Sp02 sensor\n- Can't take calls\n| Specification: | |\n| Case size | 42mm |\n| Compatibility | Android 8 through 15 iOS 15 through 18 |\n| Operating system | Wear OS |\n| Battery life | 24 hours |\nWhy you should buy this: It's the definitive smartwatch made by a luxury watchmaker.\nWho it's for: If you appreciate a luxury watchmaker's approach to design and wearability, the Connected Calibre range is for you.\nWhy we picked the Tag Heuer Connected Calibre E4: There are two different Connected Calibre E4 models, one with a 42mm case and the other with a 45mm case. We recommend the 42mm case overall, as it\u2019s going to suit more wrist sizes, but if you\u2019re happy wearing a bigger watch, the 45mm Connected Calibre E4 has a slightly different design that may appeal more. Tag Heuer has also released various special editions, including a golf-specific model and one in collaboration with Porsche.\nBut why buy a luxury smartwatch? It\u2019s all about the design, materials, and strap. The Connected Calibre E4 is made from stainless steel and has a ceramic bezel, and comes with either a steel, rubber, or leather strap equipped with Tag Heuer\u2019s excellent folding clasp. The pushers feel almost mechanical, the crown rotates, and the design is elegant and classy. It\u2019s a world apart from tech-forward smartwatch designs.\nOn the back is a heart rate sensor so it\u2019ll track all your workouts, the watch receives notifications from your phone, and it is compatible with both Android and iOS. It comes with Google\u2019s Wear OS software, and the good news is an update to Wear OS 3 should be available as you read this, bringing the smartwatch right up to date. It also keeps it competitive, as the Montblanc Summit 3 had Wear OS 3 installed at launch. The Montblanc smartwatch is a good alternative if you don\u2019t like the Tag Heuer design or its watch face options.\nAny luxury watch must make you feel special when you wear it, and the Tag Heuer Connected Calibre E4 manages to bring that special something into the world of smartwatches.\nThe best fitness smartwatch\nGarmin Forerunner 265\n- Extremely comfortable\n- Lovely AMOLED screen\n- Incredible health/fitness tools\n- Highly customizable\n- 4-plus days of battery life\n- Doesn't require any subscriptions\n- Limited smart features\n- Proprietary charger\n| Specification: | |\n| Case size | 46mm |\n| Compatibility | Unknown |\n| Operating system | Garmin OS |\n| Battery life | 13 days (smartwatch mode) 20 hours (GPS mode) |\nWhy you should buy this: You get all Garmin's fitness expertise and features in a neat smartwatch with a touchscreen.\nWho it's for: It's best for runners and sports addicts, but can also prove motivational for anyone wanting to improve their fitness.\nWhy we picked the Garmin Forerunner 265: Garmin\u2019s Forerunner series, as the name suggests, targets runners \u2014 and the 265 model sits in the middle of the options available. But just because it\u2019s most suited to running, don\u2019t think that it can\u2019t do anything else, because this is a fully featured fitness wearable that will keep most fitness addicts motivated and satisfied.\nThe 46mm case and 47 gram weight mean it\u2019ll look and feel sizable on your wrist compared to the Apple Watch Series 8 or the Galaxy Watch 5, but the 22mm band has lots of adjustment or can be quickly swapped for another one if you want to jazz up the rather plain look. Data is presented on a high-resolution AMOLED touchscreen, and there are buttons on the case to make it easy to navigate on the move or when wearing gloves.\nIt has a full sensor array to monitor heart rate and blood oxygen levels, plus Garmin\u2019s platform provides masses of additional data on your workouts, lifestyle, and sleep. It returns plenty of motivation too and can help you improve your fitness and try different plans to keep things interesting. The battery lasts for between four and seven days, depending on your use, and it recharges in around an hour.\nIf the Garmin Forerunner 265's high price and chunky design puts you off, then we recommend checking out the slightly cheaper and more stylish, but equally capable, Polar Pacer Pro instead.\nThe best smartwatch for outdoor sports\nGarmin Epix Pro (Gen 2)\n- High quality materials\n- Durable construction\n- Hugely customizable\n- Comprehensive sporting platform\n- No subscription needed\n- No Qi wireless charging\n- Operating system takes some learning\n| Specification: | |\n| Case size | 51mm |\n| Compatibility | Android iOS |\n| Operating system | Android iOS |\n| Battery life | 31 days |\nWhy you should buy this: It's the best smartwatch for outdoor enthusiasts and the seriously sporty.\nWho it's for: This watch is for anyone serious about their sport.\nWhy we picked the Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2): If you\u2019re a hiker, cyclist, runner, or adventurer, then you\u2019ll want a smartwatch that can keep up, and probably one that\u2019s both durable and customizable too. The Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2) is just about the most feature-rich sports smartwatch you can get, as it\u2019s filled with focused features and linked to the in-depth Garmin health platform.\nThere are several versions of the Epix Pro (Gen 2) to choose from, including massive 51mm versions with a sapphire crystal. And when you get it, the entire look of the software on-screen can be tailored to match your sport of choice. It\u2019s very focused, and expects you to be focused too.\nThe battery can last up to a week. There\u2019s GPS, a compass, altimeter, thermometer, a heart rate and blood oxygen sensor, and even a tiny flashlight built in. The Epix Pro (Gen 2) has new metrics for endurance and hill climbing, and even more internal storage space compared to the old model. There\u2019s a steep learning curve attached to the software, and you really have to be dedicated to a particular sport to get the most from it, but the Epix Pro (Gen 2) is an incredibly feature-packed smartwatch.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAlthough it sounds like a complicated question, this is surprisingly straightforward. If you own an Android phone, then you can use any smartwatch with Google's Wear OS software. You can also use most smartwatches from companies like Withings, Huawei, Amazfit, and others. The only one you can't use is the Apple Watch.\nIf you own an iPhone, you can use the Apple Watch (obviously) and most other smartwatches too, provided they have a compatible app. Wear OS watches used to be compatible with iPhones, but more models from the Galaxy Watch 5 and Galaxy Watch 5 Pro are not.\nGoogle and Samsung teamed up to create a software operating system for wearables called Wear OS 3. The joint project incorporates both the Wear OS and Tizen platforms, along with fitness expertise from Fitbit. The first smartwatches with the software were the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, but now there are more, especially newer Samsung models like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.\nBecause it\u2019s on your wrist, smartwatches are exposed to danger. They\u2019re easy to knock against things and can often get wet. Does this mean you must be extra careful with your watch? Many have an IP68 water resistance rating today, and some smartwatches meet military standards for toughness and will withstand harsher treatment than others. If you want to make sure you can wear your chosen device in the shower or to go swimming, then you need to think about smartwatch water resistance and look for an IP or ATM rating.\nIf you are a runner and intend to use your smartwatch to track routes, and you don\u2019t want to run with your phone, then yes, you do need GPS. Most modern smartwatches come with GPS as standard anyway, so you may find it\u2019s ready and waiting if you need it. If your smartwatch doesn\u2019t have GPS, then some can use your phone\u2019s GPS when connected, but it will be slower to operate. One thing to remember is that using GPS will drain the battery in the watch faster than usual. If you're really concerned about GPS accuracy, consider getting the Apple Watch Ultra or the Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar.\nIf your smartwatch connects to your smartphone using Bluetooth, then all the data it requires comes from your phone at no extra charge to you. This changes if you buy a smartwatch with 4G LTE, like the LTE version of the Apple Watch. When a smartwatch has its own data connection, it can be used on its own without being connected to your smartphone, ready to make calls, receive messages, and plenty more. However, you will have to pay extra for the privilege. The amount varies depending on your carrier and current plan, but expect to pay around $10 per month to enable the 4G LTE connection on your smartwatch.\nIf your Android phone or iPhone was purchased in the last three or four years, then the answer is almost certainly yes. For some context, the Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic work with any Android phone running Android 8.0 or later. The Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 are compatible with iPhones running iOS 16 \u2014 meaning any models from the iPhone 8 and newer.\nEach smartwatch operating system is different, which is to say that one operating system isn't objectively better than the other. Instead, the \"best\" OS is the one that's compatible with your smartphone. If you have an Android device, a watch running Wear OS is most likely the best choice. It's relatively easy to use, has a decent selection of apps, and has a robust feature set. If you have an iPhone \u2014 and this comes as no surprise \u2014 you should get an Apple Watch.\nSo, you think you want a smartwatch? Are you sure? After all, unlike a smartphone, no one really needs a smartwatch.\nHowever, because manufacturers are finally coming around to the realization that a smartwatch needs to look good, they're a lot more tempting than they once were. One-day battery life and a touchscreen on a watch are still hard to swallow for some people, but that's why hybrid smartwatches were invented \u2014 and battery performance and control methods are constantly getting better.\nIf you're not ready to commit to a touchscreen smartwatch but still want to try out some smart features, the huge choice of hybrid watches has got you covered. They often cost half of what you'll pay for the cheapest Apple Watch, link with any smartphone, and provide traditional watch looks matched with a connected smart experience.\nHow we test the smartwatches\nWe review smartwatches that are sent to us by companies we know and trust, including Apple, Garmin, and Samsung. We work to ensure that they are compatible with most smartphones regardless of their operating systems, can accurately read biometrics, and can withstand the elements. Those factors help us inform our decision to add the smartwatches to the list.\nWhy trust us\nDigital Trends has been reporting on the latest in consumer technology since 2006. Our writers and editors love wearing their smartwatches on a daily basis and take advantage of the features that come with them, especially features that help monitor their overall health regardless of their level of physical activity."

      "text": "\u201cSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 serves a massive generation over generation makeover that is worth absorbing, one wellness perk at a time.\u201d\n- Beautiful design with raw metallic lustre\n- Sharp and bright AMOLED display\n- Plenty of health and wellness features\n- Biosensor teaching is accurate and improved\n- Battery life could have been better\n- A few wellness features misfire poorly\n- The new strap latch system is proprietary\n- A hefty $50 price hike\nInstant Insight\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 marks a new chapter for Samsung smartwatches, one that introduces a whole new design language while AI takes charge on the software side. There\u2019s a new sensor with a smattering of next-gen health and wellness capabilities in tow. All those niceties crammed into a single package have also, unfortunately, raised the price by a healthy $50 on this generation.\nSamsung has made some crucial hardware-level changes that add to the practical appeal this time around. The display is noticeably brighter, the battery is bigger, and the conveniently designed latch system for the strap now helps achieve a better on-wrist fit. It\u2019s an impressive hardware refinement by Samsung, but also one that ends backwards compatibility for straps.\nAs far as health-centric capabilities go, Samsung is offering arguably the most diverse suite of features, which now includes tailored guidance and a long-term approach to holistic health and wellness. The sensor accuracy has also improved this time around, but a few features are still running into accuracy issues.\nI wish the battery life could make a generational leap, but that didn\u2019t happen this year. For its current asking price of $350, the Galaxy Watch 8 is a fantastic piece of smartwatch hardware. If you are a first-time smartwatch adopter or simply getting a great trade-in deal, the latest from Samsung will offer a lovely experience without any major red flags.\nGalaxy Watch 8 specs\n| Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 | |\n| Display | Sapphire Crystal 44mm: 1.47-inch (480\u00d7480) Super AMOLED, Full Color Always On Display 40mm: 1.34-inch (438\u00d7438) Super AMOLED, Full Color Always On Display |\n| Design, Dimensions, and Durability | 44mm: Graphite, Silver 40mm: Graphite, Silver 44mm: 43.7mm x 46mm x 8.6t (34.0g) 40mm: 40.4mm x 42.7mm x 8.6t (30.0g) 5ATM + IP68 / MIL-STD-810H |\n| Health features | FDA-Certified ECG Blood pressure monitor Antioxidant level check BioActive Health Sensor Advanced Glycation End-products (AGE) |\n| Processor | Exynos W1000 (5 Core, 3nm) |\n| Memory | 2GB RAM / 32GB storage |\n| Battery | 44mm: 435mAh 40mm: 325mAh |\n| Sensors | Samsung BioActive Sensor (Optical Bio-signal Sensor + Electrical Heart Signal + Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis), Temperature Sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Light Sensor |\n| Price | $349.99 (40mm), $379.99 (44mm) |\nGalaxy Watch 8 design is a sleek evolution\nQuick Take: A refreshingly minimalist design makeover with an improved strap lock approach.\nAlmost every single person in my circle has praised the Galaxy Watch 8\u2019s fresh new design, which is a blend of raw polished metal appeal and a clean-glass display module over it. Samsung offers the smartwatch in 40mm and 44mm sizes, but for my dainty wrists, the 40mm trim worked its charm.\nSo far, Samsung has remained loyal to the cause of decidedly round watch dials, just like every other brand chasing Wear OS smartwatch glory. This year, the Korean company is borrowing the charm of square watches (ahem\u2026 Apple Watch\u2026 ahem) and has beautifully managed to cram a round display over the squircle Armor Aluminum base.\nThe result is a design unlike any I\u2019ve seen so far. It\u2019s sharp, more minimalist, and the focus on a brushed metallic look gives it a more gentlemanly appeal. Unlike its predecessor, I had no qualms pairing it with a shirt or denim jacket. I just wish I could replace the white silicon strap with a suede leather strap to get my dream on-wrist look.\nTalking about the strap, the Galaxy Watch 8 also embraces a new Dynamic Lug system. I prefer the new mechanism. Unlike an Apple Watch and its sliding strap lock system, you just have to press a metallic button, and the strap opens with a springy feedback. It also goes back in with a simple push and a satisfying click that securely locks it in place.\nThe new lug system means third-party accessory makers will need some time to adapt and offer their products. More importantly, the straps of your older Samsung smartwatch won\u2019t fit on this one. On the positive side, the new strap lock design gives it a more pronounced arch at the point of attachment compared to its Apple rival.\nThe result is a more snug feel on your wrist, and I quite liked it during my morning runs. It tips the scales at 30 grams, the same as the Apple Watch Series 10, but given its wider on-wrist presence, the Galaxy Watch 8 feels deceptively light. As far as the color options go, you can pick between grey and silver. But I\u2019d recommend the silver shade as it pairs well with bands of all colors and materials.\nSamsung Galaxy 8 display & performance impress thoroughly\nQuick Take: The brighter display stands out, and the software has its charms.\nSamsung has only ever slightly increased the display size on the Galaxy Watch 8 and added a few extra pixels. On the 40mm version I tested, you are greeted by a 1.34-inch display with resolution figures of 438 x 438 pixels. It\u2019s a Super AMOLED panel, which promises stunning blacks, bright colors, and great viewing angles.\nAll those benefits reflect just fine on the Galaxy Watch 8. The big upgrade this time around is a boost in the brightness levels by a hefty 50% margin. The screen can now go all the way up to 3,000 nits, matching the brightness output of the best smartphones out there.\nIrrespective of whether I was indoors, walking in the subway, or taking a jog in the park, the panel never bothered me. Even under direct sunlight, I didn\u2019t run into legibility problems. I only have two minor woes to report about the panel. First, it has a reflection or glare issue, especially indoors when you\u2019re operating it at low brightness levels.\nSecond, now that the round display sits exposed above the metallic base, it is slightly more exposed, leaving it more vulnerable to bumps and scratches. Samsung assures that the sapphire crystal layer will do a fine job at protecting the screen, but I\u2019d still advise some caution while wearing it.\nTalking about durability, the build is IP68-cleared, which means it can handle sweaty workouts and the occasional dip in a bucket. Samsung is also touting MIL-STD 810H endurance (survive temperature extremes between -20 degrees and 50 degrees Celsius) and 5 ATM resistance for liquid exposure, which means it can handle brief immersion in shallow water. Just don\u2019t take it close to fast water jets, will ya?\nAs far as performance goes, the Galaxy Watch 8 is snappy. Yes, it\u2019s the same Exynos W1000 processor as the Galaxy Watch 7, with an identical 2GB of RAM and 32GB storage capacity. But Samsung has done a terrific job optimizing its in-house silicon to offer a smooth experience while running the Wear OS 6 software.\nWhile testing the smartwatch, I never ran into a scenario where an app crashed abruptly, nor did I run into any lag while switching between them. One UI 8 Watch running atop Wear OS 6 doesn\u2019t change the look and feel of Samsung\u2019s signature smartwatch UI, but it brings a bunch of new functional tools, such as multi-function tiles and the Now Bar system borrowed from Samsung phones.\nA left swipe on the Home Screen pulls the alerts and notifications, while swiping right gives access to the fitness tiles and activities. A downward swipe opens the control centre, while the reverse pulls up the app drawer. The whole experience now actually feels closer to an Android phone than ever, and it\u2019s a crucial victory for first-time as well as seasoned smartwatch users. Moroever, thanks to the custom hand gestures, it\u2019s possible to operate the Galaxy Watch 8 without even touching the screen.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 gestures are a hidden gem\nQuick Take: A smartwatch should focus on convenience and dexterity. The gesture controls offer just that.\nUnlike the Classic variant, the vanilla Galaxy Watch 8 trim doesn\u2019t come with a physical rotating bezel. What you get on this one are capacitive bezels that you can trace your finger in circular motion for navigating across the App Library, moving up and down within app pages, scrolling past Home Screen tiles, and notifications. It\u2019s cool, but it\u2019s a tad finicky and took me a few days to find my groove with it. I stuck with touch-based inputs for the most part, and treated the bezel navigation more like a novelty or show-off.\nMy favorite feature on the Galaxy Watch 8 is the focus on gestures. One of the most irritating aspects of a smartwatch is that you need two hands to operate it, even for the most basic tasks like checking a message notification, handling calls, media playback, and more. It gets burdensome when you\u2019re lying in chill mode on a comfy sofa, have people around you on a crowded bus, or just sleeping by your partner\u2019s side and struggling to shut down the alarm.\nOn the Galaxy Watch 8, you get broadly three gestures viz. double-pinch, shake, and knock. The best part is that these gestures are context-aware, which means they act depending on the UI page you\u2019re currently engaging with. On the Home Screen, this gesture opens the Now Bar for notification access, while a secondary double-pinch will let you move to the next notification or open the preset tile.\nThe same gesture controls music playback (play, pause, next), handles alerts (alarm, calendar, and reminders), and takes care of calls. Rotating the wrist twice executes the shake gesture, which has some overlap with the aforementioned activities, but it also acts as a back gesture and can erase text while typing. The knock gesture, which is essentially bending the wrist up and down, can launch apps, open exercises, enable torch, and do more.\nFor added flexibility, the Universal Gesture dashboard offers gestures that will let you control the Galaxy Watch 8\u2019s entire user interface. Here, you can assign core controls such as select, next, and previous to single-pinch and fist gestures. There is, definitely, a learning curve involved, but I got used to these gestures within a couple of days. Moreover, they are fairly reliable, so you won\u2019t exactly find yourself making a fist or double-pinching in vain.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 features are meaningful and plenty\nQuick Take: This watch covers all the basics you desire, and then throws a few extra tricks into the mix.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 offers an astoundingly deep set of health and wellness features that even outshine what Apple and Google have to offer. At the heart of these wellness chops is the next-gen biosensor that can now collect more heart activity metrics than just heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and ECG readings.\nThe new additions this year are Bedtime Guidance, Vascular Load, Running Coach, and Antioxidant Index. Samsung\u2019s smartwatch can now detect ectopic beats by tapping into the ECG data, and help users identify heart activity patterns that usually go undetected and can worsen over time, leading to heart failure and stroke incidents. Additionally, the PPG sensor also keeps an eye on the blood flow pattern during sleep and the stress on the blood vessel walls.\nThese metrics help create vascular load data, which is a direct reflection of the food, rest, and stress patterns of your body. Bedtime guidance performs a three-day scientific analysis of how badly your body needs sleep and how your internal body clock is tuned for some shut-eye time. Based on these biological patterns, the onboard sleep assistant offers appropriate sleep advice.\nAnd yeah, it repeatedly told me that I needed to sleep longer and shut my eyes a few hours earlier. It wasn\u2019t unexpected, since I work across different time zones and sleeping in regular hours is next to impossible for me. I was somewhat bittersweet to see the Galaxy Watch 8 reiterating those challenges.\nTalking about sleep, the Galaxy Watch 8 also comes with support for sleep apnea detection. It\u2019s a serious sleep disorder in which breathing is disrupted due to a restriction of airflow into the lungs. The smartwatch looks for signs of it by analyzing the blood oxygen levels during sleep, and can further couple it by detecting instances of snoring (which is a known signal of obstructive sleep apnea).\nFinally, we have a new feature called Antioxidant Index. As you press your finger on the watch\u2019s biosensor, it shines light through it and analyzes skin pigments known as carotenoids. Their presence in the skin is a sign that you are getting enough antioxidants by consuming vegetables and fruits (the green and orange variety, specifically), and their intake is important for healthy skin and aging.\nIt\u2019s a great feature to have, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly accurate. Or maybe it works best when you\u2019ve been on a streak of eating fruits and vegetables that boost antioxidants in your body. Before taking the latest measurement, I had eaten two pears, one Apple, a whole bowl of oats with a variety of vegetables, and pineapple juice over three consecutive meals.\nAnother misfiring element was the stress measurement system. I tested it with half a dozen people who were in a good mood, smiling and grooving to music, but the watch catalogued them in a high stress level category. A friend of mine looked visibly stressed (and I know it personally following his nasty breakup), took the feature for a spin, and the Galaxy Watch 8 profiled him at a moderate stress level.\nMoving ahead of the hiccups, you can track your food intake in terms of calories, and also keep an eye on the new Advanced Glycation End-Products (AGE) index to maintain a dietary metabolism that can help control inflammation and related diseases. As someone who pops nearly half a dozen pills and capsules for health reasons, I love the medication plan scheduler and the ability to add details by just scanning the bottle stickers.\nI also like the new running coach feature. As the name suggests, it analyzes your running routine for 12 minutes, rates your current level, and then helps create a fairly doable training regimen. It put me at level 3 (on a scale of 10) after my 5K run, which was somewhat embarrassing for me, but also gave me a new level target in terms of speed and distance metrics.\nBefore making a plan, it takes into account personal details such as height, weight, and experience, which is a good start. Additionally, the AI assistant offers mid-run guidance and details on the progress. Personally, this is the most exciting feature, and I am hoping to push it as I get back my running groove.\nIf you are a fitness enthusiast, the watch offers support for over 100 activities, from indoor cycling to swimming and weight machine workouts. For those who prefer a more zen approach to wellness, the Galaxy Watch 8 can also take you on a guided meditation and breathing exercise tour.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 activity tracking makes a crucial leap\nQuick Take: Samsung has outdone itself at biosensing accuracy, but falls a hair short of Apple.\nDuring my most recent workout session lasting 25 minutes on an elliptical bike, I measured the heart rate using the Galaxy Watch 8 and the chest-strapped Garmin HRM 10-Dual heart rate sensor. The Samsung smartwatch proved to be surprisingly accurate, and nearly overlapped with the Garmin heart rate monitor for the entire duration. There were slight momentary deviations, though, but only a couple, so it\u2019s nothing to worry about. In general, the Galaxy Watch 8 tends to falter more at recording the drop in heart rate compared to the spikes.\nIn the early phase of the workout, the Galaxy Watch 8 missed a dip in the heart rate when I took a brief break to adjust the resistance. The two wearables were otherwise neck and neck, and the Galaxy Watch 8 only overestimated the peak heart rate with a deviation of 1 or 2 percent, at worst. Based on the data I gleaned from the Apple Watch Series 8 for comparison, the Apple smartwatch was statistically close to the chest-based Garmin wearable, but the variance was pretty small.\nThe accuracy was better at outdoor cycling, compared to the sessions on an elliptical bike, and much better compared to weight exercises using dumbbells. While cycling outdoors on a route that takes me 30 minutes each way, the deviations in heart rate readings were smaller compared to what I got while working out on a bike indoors. The Apple Watch Series 8 again fared better, but not by a significant margin.\nThere are a few differences, though. The Galaxy Watch 8 consistently put the heart rate readings in a zone higher than what the Apple Watch reflected on the screen. Though both smartwatches were roughly in the same bracket in assessing the peak heart rate and average heart rate during the workout, there was roughly 10-15% variation on average for intense workouts. Compared to my experience with the Galaxy Watch 6, the Galaxy Watch 8 offers a notable improvement in all areas.\nAs far as sleep tracking goes, I couldn\u2019t source an EEG headband in time to compare the sleep data. But compared to the Apple Watch Series 8, the Galaxy Watch 8\u2019s sleep tracking was more or less in the same bracket. The only variance that I recorded was in the number of minutes logged by the Apple smartwatch in REM sleep stage (1 hour and 20 minutes) compared to the Samsung device (1 hour and 35 minutes) on my most recent shut-eye adventure.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 battery life is acceptable, but not the best\nQuick Take: In full throttle, the Galaxy Watch 8 can last a full day, which isn\u2019t the competition\u2019s best, but the slow charging tests your patience.\nSamsung has fitted a 325mAh battery on the Galaxy Watch 8, which is 27% bigger than the one fitted inside its predecessor. I worked out for an hour each day, while the watch was connected to my phone all day long with synced notifications, and always-on display mode was enabled. The brightness levels, on the other hand, were set to auto-adjustment mode.\nWith that kind of usage, the Samsung smartwatch gave me an average mileage of 27-30 hours per charge. It\u2019s not terrible, but certainly not the best in the segment. Samsung has leapfrogged the battery endurance figures I get from my Apple Watch, but it still hasn\u2019t managed to beat OnePlus\u2019 latest smartwatch, and also those running a customized RTOS software.\nDuring the course of the testing, I never enabled power-saving modes, however. The biggest nuisance is the slow charging speed. The magnetic puck that comes supplied in the retail package is pretty slow, and it takes the watch roughly two hours on the clock to fully juice up an empty tank.\nShould you buy the Galaxy Watch 8?\nThe latest from Samsung is also, pound for pound, its best smartwatch yet. It has a design that falls far from the nerdy appeal of smartwatches, but there\u2019s more to it than meets the eye. It\u2019s lighter, offers a better on-wrist fit, and serves a brighter display.\nThe software experience, now supercharged by AI, is loaded with tons of innovative features that not only cover workout training, but also take a proactive approach at fixing your inner metabolism, sleep, and even improve the current exercise regimens with personalized guidance.\nI wish Samsung had gone the extra mile with battery life and sped up the charging pace, but the Galaxy Watch 8 still races ahead of Apple on this crucial metric. If you\u2019re an iPhone user, there\u2019s simply nothing for you here. Overall, for its $350 asking price, it\u2019s a worthy package. And if you can score a trade-in deal, it\u2019s an even sweeter pick.\nWhy not try\u2026?\nThe two biggest competitors of the Galaxy Watch 8 are the Google Pixel Watch 3 and the OnePlus Watch 3. If you want the best Wear OS experience with quick update cadence, minimalist looks, reliable performance, and advanced health features, the Google device is a great choice. I would, however, recommend waiting a few weeks as the Pixel Watch 4 is right around the corner.\nOn the other hand, if battery life is your top priority and you don\u2019t mind a slightly bulky build, the OnePlus Watch 3 should serve you just fine. Moreover, it will also save you some money while at it. Additionally, you can look at the Galaxy Watch 6, as well, if it\u2019s available at a discount. It covers all the basics and will soon get some of the Wear OS 6 goodies that are currently shining on its successor.\nHow we tested\nI purchased a 40mm version of the Galaxy Watch 8 for this review and paired it with a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. I used it for a spell of two weeks, pushing it during my morning workouts that included a mix of running, cycling, at-home elliptical exercises, stretching, and strength exercises. Over the course of testing, the watch went through ten charging cycles, both complete and partial.\nI also wore it for over a week consistently to check the sleep accuracy and generate the map for sleep guidance. Notifications were routed through a Samsung phone, the always-on display mode was always enabled, and gesture controls were active, as well. The smartwatch was connected to the phone at all times during an average day, and no third-party accessories were used for charging it."
