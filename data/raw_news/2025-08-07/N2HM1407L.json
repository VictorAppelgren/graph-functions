  "description": "AI isn\u2019t replacing neurodivergent minds; it\u2019s finally making space for them to thrive. In a world shaped by automation, human difference is becoming our greatest advantage.",
  "content": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked conversations about job loss and identity. Roles are shifting, systems are evolving, and many wonder where people will fit. For neurodivergent individuals, though, AI can offer something else entirely. It is not a threat to their value, but a tool that helps reveal it.\n\nFor those whose brains process information differently, AI can reduce the friction of daily tasks. It makes the world a little easier to navigate. When routine obstacles are removed, creativity and insight have more room to surface. The point is not to change how someone thinks, but to stop asking them to hide how they think in order to participate. I\u2019ve experienced this myself. I grew up with dyslexia and a rare bone disease that kept me in a wheelchair throughout my childhood. The systems around me were rarely designed with my needs in mind. I was told that I would fall behind, and sometimes I did. But not because I lacked intelligence. I simply experienced the world in a different way. Over time, I learned to adapt. I found ways to approach problems creatively and built a career by thinking differently. Still, it wasn\u2019t until I began using AI tools in my daily work that I felt a sense of ease. Spellcheckers catch what I miss. Planning tools help me stay organized. Summarizers bring structure to my ideas. These tools don\u2019t replace my thinking, they make it more accessible to myself and to others. And when the right supports are in place, what becomes possible begins to shift for everyone.\n\nThis kind of support opens up new possibilities, not just for individuals but for organizations. Neurodivergent professionals often bring skills that are hard to teach. They recognize patterns, challenge assumptions, and approach complex problems from unexpected angles. As automation takes over repetitive tasks, these strengths are becoming even more valuable. Historically, though, workplaces have not been built to support this kind of contribution. Expectations have favored conformity over creativity. That is beginning to change. Partnerships like the one between Vanderbilt University and AllianceBernstein are showing what happens when we invest in cognitive diversity. Their research confirms what many of us have lived. When neurodivergent individuals are supported, they do more than fit in. They help move things forward.\n\nBut when it comes to AI, we still need to understand its limits. It can process data and manage logistics, but it is limited in its ability to sense context in complex situations and generate the kind of deep, meaningful, and holistic conclusions that humans can. It does not imagine what could be. It waits to be told what to do. This is where neurodivergent minds shine. They are often at their best when structure breaks down. They bring innovation, ethical sensitivity, and imagination. These are the kinds of insights that AI cannot replicate. WHY SUPPORT MUST GO BEYOND TOOLS\n\nStill, understanding the language we use is only part of the picture. The environments we build matter just as much. The term neurodiverse describes the range of thinking styles in any group. Neurodivergent refers to individuals who think in ways that diverge from cultural expectations. Autism, ADHD, and dyslexia are all part of this category. We are all part of neurodiversity, but not all of us are neurodivergent. That distinction matters because it helps us move from vague inclusion to intentional design. Even in forward-thinking workplaces, many neurodivergent professionals still struggle in silence. Fast meetings, noisy spaces, and unspoken rules make it difficult to fully participate. Often, people hesitate to ask for accommodations, even when those changes would help them thrive.\n\nA report from The Washington Post offers practical strategies to address this. It emphasizes that supporting neurodivergent professionals isn\u2019t about changing the individual, but about changing the environment. From quiet rooms to clear communication practices, small shifts can make a big difference. Research backs this up. Seventy percent of neurodivergent employees report feeling uncomfortable asking for support. That is not because they don\u2019t need it. It is because our systems still frame accommodations as exceptions instead of thoughtful design.\n\nOrganizations can shift this dynamic by planning for difference from the start. NHS Employers has found that giving people more control over how and where they work leads to better outcomes for everyone. When we support one group well, we often make things better for all. These are not perks. They are proof that good design serves people. AI won\u2019t solve every challenge, but it can be a catalyst for unlocking human potential.",

      "text": "The Vanderbilt University Frist Center for Autism and Innovation, in collaboration with AllianceBernstein and Vanderbilt\u2019s Corporate Partnerships team, hosted an event at the firm\u2019s New York City office on Thursday, April 17, to celebrate Autism Acceptance Month. The \u201cFrom Autism Acceptance to Advantage: Learning from Autism to Create Innovative Workplaces and Teams\u201d event showcased examples of cutting-edge technologies and management strategies to help organizations tap into unique pools of talent and become employers of choice.\nAllianceBernstein Global Head of Investments Chris Hogbin kicked off the event. \u201cIn both my roles as global head of investments at AllianceBernstein and as a proud Vanderbilt parent, I am excited about our partnership with the Frist Center for Autism and Innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cHere at AB, we are committed to creating a world where all minds can thrive and strongly believe that neurodiversity drives higher performance. Together, we\u2019re turning these values into action, with the help of leaders in the field like Dr. Keivan Stassun and Dr. Tim Vogus, by fostering inclusive workplaces and inspiring change.\u201d\nJames Kellerhouse, assistant vice chancellor for strategic initiatives in New York City, followed Hogbin\u2019s remarks with a welcome to attendees.\nVanderbilt professors Stassun and Vogus demonstrated tech tools and organizational practices that can unleash the creative talents of individuals and teams. Stassun, Stevenson Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Vanderbilt, also serves as the director of the Frist Center for Autism and Innovation, the founding co-director the Fisk-Vanderbilt Master\u2019s-to-Ph.D. Bridge Program and holds a joint appointment with computer science in the School of Engineering. Vogus is deputy director of the Frist Center, the faculty director of the Leadership Development Program and the Brownlee O. Currey, Jr., Professor of Management within Owen Graduate School of Management.\nThey discussed the disproportionate barriers that autistic employees face in obtaining high-quality, sustainable employment and the \u201cdouble empathy problem\u201d\u2014 the ways in which autistic and neurotypical people often struggle to understand one another\u2019s communication styles\u2014that contributes to these challenges.\nThe presenters offered concrete steps organizations can take to bridge the double empathy problem, such as rethinking interviewing processes, onboarding practices, performance feedback and organizational culture. By creating conditions where mutual understanding can be repaired and valuing the unique perspectives neurodivergent individuals bring to the workplace, organizations can become more inclusive and innovative through radical collaboration.\nThe event concluded with a Q&A session and a thank you from Andrea M. DiMarco, regional director of corporate partnerships for Vanderbilt\u2019s New York City Regional Hub.\nLearn more about the Frist Center for Autism & Innovation."

AI can simplify daily tasks, allowing neurodivergent professionals to contribute creatively and effectively in workplaces that have historically favored conformity. However, to truly support neurodivergent individuals, organizations must focus on creating inclusive environments that accommodate diverse thinking styles, as highlighted by recent collaborations between Vanderbilt University and AllianceBernstein. By implementing thoughtful design and practical strategies, companies can unlock the potential of neurodiversity, benefiting all employees.",
