  "content": "Good morning. This is Horizon's Middle East and Africa. Our top stories this morning, Stagflation fears the Asian shares trading in a narrow range after Wall Street wipes out gains as weak U.S. services. Data fuels uncertainty over the Fed's policy path. President Trump ramps up threats of new tariffs on countries buying energy from Russia, as well as chips on drugs, chips and drugs. And Israel is weighing a full military takeover of Gaza, despite concern from defense chiefs and the likelihood of international opposition. Well, it's just gone across the Emirates. I'm on a Versace and Dubai while the new world, the new narrative that has emerged for the markets in the last 24 hours is one of stagflation. That is some services print surprising to the downside, especially on employment growth. But with prices paid coming in higher. So you've got a bit of a pullback yesterday for Wall Street. Overnight, though, we're seeing somewhat of a recovery for S & P futures were up 2/10 of a percent. More earnings hitting this afternoon. We've got McDonald's, Disney and Uber Ulta.com. So big blue chip names in the US index to watch out for later this afternoon. European markets also trading slightly towards the green as well, keeping a close eye on fixed income and what's been going on there yesterday after. Are that a sudden number? We actually saw a bit of a flattening of the curve. So a retracement of the most recent bull steepening move that we've seen. But bottom line is we've still got ten year yield sitting at around 4.22 and a lot lower than where they were prior to that. Jobs prints on Friday and Brent's $68 were another 6/10 of a percent firmer. This time around, we're focused on what may happen with the US conversations with Russia. We know that Steve Wyckoff is heading to Russia towards the end of this week. That ceasefire deadline is on Friday, and if nothing is agreed to between Russia and Ukraine, then potentially there is that option of the secondary tariffs. And so this is what this market is responding to. And the reason why you're seeing a little bit of geopolitical premium being built up and the energy complex switching over because I've mentioned this I some services prince, take a look at that white light. So that is the employment index. And you can see that essentially the headline number is pointing to around stagnation. We're sitting about 50 but the employment numbers. So the employment, the services employment figure is sitting at 46.4, very, very weak. And then if you go one step further, not shown on this chart, but prices paid jumping, so you're getting higher prices, but a lower employment outlook. Hence why people have been talking about stagflation. What does that mean for the Fed? Well, it complicates things. So something to bear in mind. Okay, Let's check in on how markets in Asia are faring. Gabriel Hong is in our Singapore studio as well. April, run us through these markets today. How we're seeing Asia stocks on a third session of gains. So bucking the trend that we saw on Wall Street by the markets we're really focused on today is India, as we have that RBI decision due in about 3 minutes from now. And of course, prior to this week, if you'd asked economists, they would have told you it's quite clear today would be a hole. But Trump tariff threats have really put a spanner in the works, and now that seems less clear. According to the survey of economists polled by Bloomberg, 30% see a cut, 70% see a hole. So Trump has made the RBI meeting the decision today, a live one. We're seeing the rupee firming a little, but it is actually not far from record lows. It could come under pressure regardless of what the RBI does today because of the narrow yield gap it has with the U.S. We're also seeing these stocks in India pretty flat ahead of the decision Jomana. Yeah, big one that's coming out in about half an hour's time. So let's see, especially with, as you say, so much of the tariff talk directed towards India these days over hung in Singapore. Well, speaking of, President Trump says he will impose higher tariffs on countries buying energy from Russia. Trump also says he will announce levies on semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports within the next week or so. For more, let's bring in senior editor Bill Ferries. So Trump's language towards India has turned harsher and harsher in the last couple of days. He's described their economy as being, quote, dead, says that their tariff barriers are obnoxious. It seems as though Modi's defiant stance is not resonating well with Trump. So where will this all lead to when it comes to those tariff discussions? Yeah. The erosion in this relationship between India and the US is really not something that many people expected just a couple of months ago. You had top US officials saying they thought India was going to be near the front of the line for striking a deal. Now India seems to be getting one of the worst deals out there, 25% tariffs so far, with President Trump threatening even more going forward. And India seemingly to not really be sure how to respond. They're not escalating the situation. They seem to want to hope that they can find a way to negotiate their way through this. But with the president's focus increasingly on the buyers of Russian oil. India is in the crosshairs of Trump at this point. Interestingly enough, China is actually a bigger buyer of Russian oil, but doesn't seem to be feeling the same kind of pressure that New Delhi is so far. Yeah. And in the same vein, the Swiss president is making her way over to D.C.. But what's interesting about that visit, Bill, is she's not meeting with President Trump. She's going to be meeting with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio. What hope is there for the Swiss at this point to bring down their own tariff rate of what is likely to be 39%? Yeah. I mean, this is a real last minute gamble by the Swiss president. We know the US has said that the new tariffs will come into effect at 12:01 a.m. Washington time on Thursday. So that's really giving the Swiss president about 36 hours to try to strike a deal or try to at least get these tariffs delayed. But she's coming over without a direct invitation from the White House. I'm sure she's still hoping that she can find a way to meet with President Trump along with those some of those other top officials. But Switzerland was really blindsided by that 39% tariff, much higher than the 15% that EU nations got, and really higher than any other industrialized nation. Their options for dealing with that are going to be a little limited, but they can try to make purchases of U.S. energy. They can talk about investments or contributing to an investment fund. That's what countries like Japan have done. But the clock is definitely ticking on Switzerland to avoid these really punitive tariffs. Senior editor Bill Ferris, Thank you so much. Well, as Bill was speaking, we just got some headlines coming through. Cathay Pacific earnings are out. Just to give you the quick headlines on the first half net income coming in at 3.65 billion HKD. That is an increase of 1.1%. First half operating profit, 5.93 billion HKD. First interim dividend per share at 20 Hong Kong cents. But the big headline over here is that they have announced that they're going to be buying 14 Boeing 7779 jets with an option to buy up to seven more. This would be their first Boeing order in 12 years and obviously a major boost for the 777 program. It's yet to be certified. That's a plane that's yet to be certified and obviously is one of the planes that has been very delayed in actually coming into service. But very notable from Cathay, because this is their first order in 12 years. The last time they made a Boeing order was actually in 2013. So Boeing has been losing out to Cathay to Airbus over the last decade. But the tie, it seems to be turning so positive for Boeing here. All right. Let's go back to some of these markets. US services sector effectively stagnated in July as firms face a tepid demand and rising costs. The employment index has contracted for the fourth time in five months, marking one of the lowest readings since the pandemic. The data paints a picture of a sluggish service economy, wrestling with the fallout of higher towers. For more on how markets are reacting to the news, let's bring in and Sebastian, the head of equities at Cerberus Capital. Good to have you with us. And what do you make of that latest market narrative and that the US may be heading towards a stagflation environment, though? So, I mean, if you look at what Paul has previously stated, he did say that, you know, majority of the policymakers want to take a wait and see approach and before taking any rate cut decisions. But with the July jobs data release and this being, I think the more key data before the next FOMC, I think this will shift the policy stance that they've taken. The weak headline of the July number was not only weaker than expected, but also a massive revision in the past. Data releases imply that, you know, the jobs market has lost steam much earlier than expected. So I think the growth aspect is going to become more important than the inflation aspect. So due to the risk of the Fed being seen as behind the curve, we think that, you know, and with the tariffs coming through and that really eating at the household spending power and corporate profits, I think that it's increasingly likely that a September cuts will will come through even if inflation is high. Okay. That's interesting because I was going to ask you about how the feds will likely look at this data. How likely is it that we get a sustained rate cutting cycle? And I'm not just talking about it's September, but a sustained rate cutting cycle. If those inflation rates start to move in the wrong direction, i.e., start moving upwards. Yeah, that is a bit of a more tricky one. I think in a kind of stagflation environment, they might take a hybrid approach of taking a wait and see. Let's see how the specific inflation data pans out relative to the growth data. But I think there is more pressure than previously communicator previously thought from a growth angle because the employment figures are very important for the Fed. So I think now going forward, you know, we would think that easing would start, but it becomes a little bit more data dependent. Hmm. What do you make of the broader E.M. landscape here? It's been actually a pretty solid start to the year, and you can point that back to some of the weakness in the U.S., which has benefited the emerging market currencies. Looking ahead, speaking about some of the specific headwinds that could be facing the U.S. economy and also the fact that valuations are a lot higher than they were at the start, or at least where we were back in April. What is going to be the knock on effects, do you think, for where investors want to see capital and put their capital in the second half of this year? I think it's still a good environment for emerging markets, naturally. You know, when the U.S. dollar weakens, that does bode well for equities, especially, you know, equities that have a high beta to em, equities such as South African equities. So I think, you know, the US dollar weakening does create a good environment, but growth fears and tariffs to create concerns from a valuation perspective, You know, developed markets have performed relatively better over the past years relative to equities. So you do still see some markets with relative valuation opportunities. Sitting where I am in in South Africa, South African equities, you know, it's valued about 27% year to date in dollar terms relative to EEM, which has rallied 15% in dollar terms. So even they in a valuation perspective, you see still a minus one standard deviation valuation being cheaper in South Africa relative to EAME. So there is a definite upside, but the tariff landscape, how that actually effects markets, but broadly I think, you know, it is relatively better valued and if the dollar weakens, that should bode well for M asset classes in general. Yeah. Let me just ask you specifically about South Africa. We just had a chart up with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. It's up more than 27% this year. How are the tariffs and the new punitive tariff rate likely to impact sentiment, or does it not matter that much for investors in the space? It does matter. So the U.S. reimposed the 30% tariff. You know, it was initially communicated in April and re-imposed in July. And, you know, we find ourselves in a relative disadvantage relative to the other countries, many that have been able to negotiate the terms lower. So the reality is that the positive of this is that the exemptions remain. So many of the exports from South Africa to the US, largely the metals and minerals. They remain exempt to the tariffs. So they will enter the US duty free. But there are sectors that are impacted the auto industry as well as agriculture industries. So the auto industry will get a, you know, a double whammy impact firstly. You know, the the the the tariff goes from 0 to 30%, impacting its direct compact competitiveness, but also from a relative perspective, its competitors, many have been able to negotiate the tariffs lower. So from a relative perspective, it also has felt the pain. But the South African government has stepped in because there is a risk of about 30%, 30,000 jobs being lost in South Africa supporting these companies from, you know, exemption from competition rules, but also offering them financial support facilities. So we think, you know, it will have a negative impact on South African growth. There are estimates out this, you know, a -0.2 drag on growth. Yeah, but tariffs, there's a lot of uncertainty still. And Sebastian, thank you so much. Head of equities at Cervantes Capital. Now coming up, Israel is reportedly weighing an expansion of its armed presence in Gaza despite growing calls for an end to the war. We are live in Jerusalem next. This is Bloomberg. Israel is said to be weighing a full military takeover of Gaza, despite concern amongst military chiefs and the public that such a move jeopardizes the prospect of Hamas freeing its remaining hostages. And Israeli officials have told Bloomberg the plan would face considerable international opposition. Let's go to Jerusalem now and speak to Bloomberg's Don Williams, who's been writing about the story and the latest report up on the terminal overnight. Dan, let me just ask you, what would be the purpose of taking over the rest of the enclave that isn't already under Israeli control, about 25% of the territory? How does that support the mission to ultimately bring back the hostages that are still being held in captivity? To hear the Israeli officials tell it. The purpose would be to win the war, to bring a victory. This war is almost 22 months old. I think even Netanyahu would acknowledge that this duration was not something he anticipated or wanted. And yes, the hostages returning them recovering those 50 hostages is one of the war aims. Another one is eliminating Hamas. And, as Israel puts it, ensuring that Gaza never presents a threat, as it did on October 7th, 2023, when this war began. The real question is if this invasion, if this conquest of the rest of the Gaza Strip is authorized when decision makers assemble tomorrow, just 36 hours from now, how many of those hostages will be recovered alive? Israel believes 20 of them are alive. Now, Hamas has openly said it would execute them rather than see them rescued by the Israelis. And there's always a chance of collateral damage in the course of intensive urban combat, especially in areas that have yet to see that urban combat during this war. So the stakes are very high, but the Israelis are very clear about what their strategy would be here and the end game. Bloomberg's Don Williams in Jerusalem, thank you so much. We'll wait and see what the cabinet decides in the coming days. Now, coming up, one of Africa's largest banks by assets is narrowing its focus on the continent as it pursues growth. Our interview with the Nedbank CEO is next. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back to Horizon's Middle East and Africa. I'm Jomana Versace in Dubai. Nedbank is planning to sell its stake in Pan-African lender Ecobank as it narrows its focus on the continent's. The disposal of its 21.2% holding will mark the end of a 17 year strategic alliance that enabled Nedbank to expand its footprint beyond its home region. Nedbank shares fell in Tuesday's session on investor concerns about the impact on the lender's return on equity. CEO Jason Quinn spoke to Bloomberg's Jennifer Salazar. You know, we only own 21% of Ecobank and we would prefer to own or control all of the operations that we're involved in because we just believe you can execute strategy much more deliberately when you own businesses. And so there was the that that was one of the factors we considered. We also are looking to probably grow our West. I'm sorry, I used to African business and our SADC business and our South African business at this time and we've got some opportunities to do that. So I think it was more around, you know, us and where we see if we're going and where we see our returns. I'd be most attractive to shareholders in the future. But Ecobank did actually give you some exposure, though, to markets that Nedbank didn't previously have. Does that mean those markets are a little less important? Or you talk about then really how this fits into the broader strategy? I think the one of the main reasons is that we thought a long time ago that we could collaborate with their bank and serve our clients in those markets. That turned out to be more challenging than we expected. And it's also fair to say that that many of our clients are no longer in those markets. So it was a combination of factors together with financial decision. Was there a reassessment potentially of how much the bank was actually worth? Because we did see Ecobank reporting results not too long ago. They did quite well in the first half of the year as well initially. And 26 it was you bought the stake for $500 million. Have you taken a look at the financial decision behind it, as you were just alluding to there? Yeah, absolutely. And I think Ecobank did have a good half. So clearly, the financial aspects are such that we had an original investment and then as an associate, we accrued round about 6.8 billion rand of earnings or associated income against that over time. We then had only received, in fact about 400 million rand of dividends from that investments. So a bit of a mismatch between the earnings accrued and the cash received. But on the other hand, on the foreign currency reserves, those were particularly negative over the period of the investment. So we're carrying the investments in our books at a relatively low value. I think that company has has good prospects and certainly a reset of strategy under new leadership. It just may well be that that we may not be the best owners of it at this point. And we certainly find lots of interest with respect to people looking to buy their 21 piece, take 21% stake from us. That was Nedbank CEO Jason Quinn speaking to Jennifer as that message out. Well, Bloomberg has learned that open air is in early talks for a secondary share sale that could value the company at around $500 billion. Sources say investors, including Thrive Capital, are looking to buy shares from current and former employees. Open A's previous valuation stood at $300 billion and a $40 billion financing round led by SoftBank Group. And speaking of tech, let's take a look at how some of these markets are faring up. And you can see that S & P futures and NASDAQ are actually trading in the green. So bucking yesterday's slight dip towards the close, we have that ISM services number surprising to the downside, particularly on the employment side of things. But today, things are looking up. We've got lots of earnings coming through Disney, Uber, McDonald's. So some of the big blue chip American companies reporting later this afternoon. European markets also tilting towards the green, up 3/10 of a percent. I want to switch over and quickly talk about oil as well. We're keeping a close eye on the energy complex. We just had some earnings come through from Adnoc Gas. So we're going to be speaking to the CFO in just a moment. But the broader picture right now for oil is one of green. And you can see the Brent complex is trading at around $68, 6/10 of a percent firmer on some geopolitical premium ahead of those Russia talks being priced in. But as I just said, Adnoc gas is just out with its latest quarterly results. The company has also been on an expansion spree. We're going to be speaking to the CFO next. Good morning. This is Harrison's Middle East and Africa. Our top stories this morning, Stagflation fears Asian shares trading in a narrow range after Wall Street wipes out gains as weak U.S. services. Data fuels uncertainty over the Fed's policy path. President Trump ramps up threats of new tariffs on countries buying energy from Russia, as well as on chips and drugs plus energy and focus. We speak to the CFO of Adnoc Gas on second quarter earnings and the CEO of Saudi drilling firm ADAIRS. After M & A, well, it's just gone 8:30 a.m. across the Emirates I in one of Versace in Dubai. Getting you up to speed on these markets with Wall Street trading in the green this morning after a pullback yesterday, I assume services figure sent shockwaves through the market and also adds to the narrative that the labor complex in the US has started to weaken. We had the jobs, jobs, payroll prints on Friday, surprising to the downside, the downside revisions. And then yesterday, the employment components of ism also surprising to the downside. But that being said, we have US futures leaning towards the green. More earnings coming today the likes of Disney, uber McDonald's to watch out for ten year yield sitting at 4.22. We saw a bit of a flattening of the US yield curve yesterday after that assumptions and then Brent $68 up 6/10 of a percent. Keeping a close eye on that meeting between Whitcomb and Russian officials. He's just landed in Moscow this morning and whether some ground can be reached on the postponement of what Trump is saying could be secondary tariffs on Russia, especially punishing the countries that continue to buy Russian oil. So something to keep an eye on over there. As for the terminal chart today, let's just switch over to talking about the ESM. Assume that came out yesterday. Just to show you graphically, the headline number came in around 50, so very close to stagnating. But then the employment component that's the white line has contracted for four out of five months. It tells you that the employment situation still very weak or continues to weaken and the US is something to watch out for there. Okay, let's switch on and talk about earnings add, not gas. Second quarter net income has beat estimates coming in at $1.27 billion. That is a jump of 6.7% year on year. And I'm just going to bring you a couple of the more a couple of other headlines that have come through as well. So the net income figure up 6.7% year on year revenues, $6.1 billion. That is up 0.4% year on year event margin, 35.4%. So a bit of an increase versus 34.3%. And then the capital expenditure CapEx figure always closely watched for by the market, also up 29%. And then also one final announcement, there is a dividend that's going to be paid out of 8.5 73a share for the first half. So for more to discuss this, happy to say that Peter Vendrell, the CFO of Adnoc Gas, joins us in the commentary. Your CEO said this has been the highest quarterly net income in adnoc gases history. What do you point that down to? And good morning and good morning. Thank you for having me. Indeed. Gas produced record high net income in the second quarter of this year. It was in fact 1,385,000,000 in the quarter, which means 16% more than the second quarter of 2024. And that is in an environment in which the Brent pricing was coming down. And that means that the company is actually very resilient to what happens in the oil price environment that we have seen happening quarter on quarter. Company performed really well, a record high, as you said, even up by 8%, net income up by 16%. Yeah. And you have this ambition of 40%. It's a growth between 2023 and 2029. In June of this year, you announced contracts for phase one of the rich gas development project. To what extent does that contribute towards your ambitions of those appetite growth and how much extra production can we get or expect to see out of this Phase one? So the company is on the growth project. We will deliver 40% more EBIDTA compared to the year 23 in the year 2019. So in that five year time period, we will increase our EBIT about 40%. Why? We have, first of all, a lot of additional demand that we want to satisfy demand in the UAE on the back of strong economic growth that we foresee, but also international markets. Think about LNG, where growth and for example, Asia market is about 3 to 5% every year. So we really preparing for those demands increases that we see in our environment. But on the back of that, we also see an increase in production because we will simply process more roll gas that comes with higher production by our NOC, which aims to increase its production to 5 million barrels per day capacity by the year 2027. So we've got more of a raw gas to process. Same time we've got the demand that we want to satisfy. Okay, so it's double. You've got more demand then also potentially more production as well. And just going back to that rich gas development project, how much extra capacity are you expecting to get out of the phase one of the project? So the Rich Gas Development Project is basically a project that enables us to produce more raw gas in total in the same period of five years while we grow to keep it at about 40%, our production capacity will grow by 30%. And the rich gas development, which is actually three phases in total, will give us more than 1.5 million cost per day, and that is on a ten Bcf basis gives you something like an uptick of more than 10%. So it's material we invest in the first five $5 billion. The company in total has committed CapEx of 20 billion over a five year period and likely that will increase more. And our projects are extremely profitable. We deliver mid-teen returns. You talk about that big CapEx spending number, $20 billion, that's not insignificant. How are you going to raise that capital? And could you return or could you actually come to the bond markets to help fund some of your CapEx expenditures? We're a capital heavy industry, Right. And to put it in perspective of not gas is a company with a market cap of $70 billion over five years, $20 billion should be seen in that context. We generate revenues of about $24 billion per year. So the company going forward will use its leverage, its balance sheets to leverage and finance the increase in capital expenditure. Today, we have hardly any financing on the balance sheet, so we're quite robust going forward. We will have a ratio EBIT, our net debt that will never be more than 2.0. So we're really well positioned to accommodate the growth. Also, the financing on our end is something the balance sheet can easily carry. Yeah. Okay. I take your point there. We've been tracking a lot of these trade deals that the US has been engaging with various trading partners around the world, and there seems to be a new template. One part of it involves these countries committing to buy more energy products from the United States. And a big focus of that is going to be on gas and potential LNG exports from the United States. How are you thinking about this new future competition arising from the US in the LNG space? Well, no gas is located in the UAE, and our LNG cargoes have already been 80% committed. That includes our current production as well as the future production from Always LNG, which is a new energy export scheme that will be ready in 2028. 80% of our sales have been locked in. Now, second, if we look at both cargoes, we have a choice. We can go to the West. Think about the European market or we can go to the east and in particular the Asia market is extremely strong in terms of demand. This is driven by economic growth. It is also an ambition to go from coal to gas. So there are many drivers for the growth in the eastern part of the world. And like I said, we're very well positioned to serve both markets. Peter, really good to chat to you. Thank you so much for coming on on the day of your earnings that Peter Vanderbilt, CFO of ADNOC as well. Busy couple of minutes over here. We just had the RBI rate decision that's come through. It is unchanged. The India Central Bank has left the key rates at five and a half percent and that was in line with market expectations. And by the way, it was unanimous, six out of six MPC members voting for that stance decision. Some commentary coming through on the growth. The GDP growth projection is that six and a half percent and that growth expected 2627 to reach 6.6%. So not a huge growth downgrade come through. Let's sit well, let's get over to April. Hong has been looking at all of this. Talk us through the initial market reaction, April, and what we're getting at. No surprise really on the interest rate front, but perhaps the commentary is what's driving markets here. Yeah. As the RBA chose to leave rates unchanged. It's worth noting that there were a handful of economists that actually predicted that it would cut this time around. And this is because Trump has not only hit India with a 25% tariff rate, but is threatening more to come. So the impact potentially on the growth trajectory you're hearing from the RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra, talking about how tariffs are, you know, these uncertainties involving and it's something that, you know, is providing a challenge backdrop for India's growth overall. What you're seeing as well, it's worth highlighting is that in keeping this neutral stance, the RBI, it also tells you that there might be a higher bar for future rate cuts. And he's also talked about how policy transmission is ongoing. Don't forget, the RBI has cut rates this year by 100 basis points, including a surprise 50 basis point move in the June meeting. So maybe at this point choosing to let it work through the system. Despite the tariff uncertainties in terms of the market reaction, you're seeing the rupee more or less hanging on to the earlier gains, but we're not far from a record low. Maybe this choose to whole take some of the pressure off. Aside from that, we're seeing yields spike in India and on stocks. They are extending gains a little bit at the moment, Jomana. Yeah. And on the inflation, they're saying the inflation outlook is more benign. Second quarter inflation seen at 2.1%, third quarter 3.1%, fourth quarter 4.4%. Still speaking about the uncertainty of tariffs on external demand as well, April Hong and Singapore, as we continue to get the commentary coming through from the RBI governor here. Welcome back to Horizon's Middle East and Africa. I'm John Versace in Dubai. Saudi drilling firm Adams has agreed to a recommended offer to acquire the also listed shelf and drilling by way of a cash merger. The deal will value Shell's drilling at around $380 million. Joining us now is the latest group, CEO Mohammad Farooq. A really good to have you with us on the show, especially after this big announcement yesterday. Talk us through the rationale behind the deal and the acquisition of shelf drilling. How does it add to your overall portfolio? Thank you. Thank you, Michael, for the meeting this morning. Actually, itself is one of the peers who have been competing together for some time. And today they have a very attractive platform with close to 33 jackup where 14 of those jackup are premium jackup, which I think is great to make the consolidation where we be close to 120 feet in terms of assets. And those assets, again, are existing into very attractive markets, which are growth markets including the Middle East, including Southeast Asia and the West Africa, so that it gets a better and stronger base into the areas where we operate, which would hopefully would operate and give better quality to our clients, also integrating their workforce, which are very experienced workforce. On another note visit, this is a very important for us to execute our playbook into integration, where since 2017 we have been doing Yemenese into the right part of the cycle and getting the value out of this, which I think is very important from creating cash flow generation positive. Again, it's securing a good backlog with our backlog today exist at $7.9 billion. This will add another 1.5. This would be close closer to $10 billion of a backlog. Again, there is a lot of standard operational and financial where we guided the market. There could be a 40, $50 million synergies on the operational side, plus another saving on the interest expense could reach 3.5%. And that's that's on the operational. It would be accretive for EPS from day one. Yeah. So let me I'm just going to jump in here and ask you about because obviously you mentioned that you've made a lot of acquisitions in the last few years and I took a look at your balance sheets, very impressive gross margins, but also strong cash flows as well. Do you plan to make more acquisitions of this magnitude in the coming years? Is this is how you're going to support further growth? Yeah, I think for a while we will make that integration if they deal with happen and make sure it is stable, generating the expectation and then we will look for another at our our acquisitions. It has to criteria number one, it has to be coming with a backlog. So we have to see cash flow visibility to overcome this cyclic market. Number two, it has to have the value creation. And as you know, offshore, there are limited assets in the offshore today. Worldwide, there's close to 400 assets. There is no newbuild given the value of new built can exceed $300 million. So creating this value specifically, it's exactly like the IP value created by the technology company where you can get this value by acquiring those high value assets and creating the barrier of entry. Yeah. So I know you are a Saudi based company with an international footprint, but can I just ask you specifically about drilling activity within Saudi Arabia? We published a couple of stories last week suggesting that the rig count has started to decline. What is the outlook in Saudi Arabia for drilling right now? Yeah, this is a very interesting question for sure. There has been some, I would say a suspension for some of the rigs, as you mentioned, given the production profile today with the output increasing their production as you may have seen till the year end and specifically of this production increase or will continue to be there, this may need more work over activities and development activities on top of this. You have been addressing that in a very, I would say, financial point of view. And if today what the the the the kind of sanctions on Russia would take place, this would need someone to come and pump more oil in the market to create more stability. And one of the largest that would do that is Saudi Arabia given that their production capacity they have today up to 12.4 million barrels a day, that would need, again, more activities which may even increase their production and increase activities of drilling. So it depends actually all about the OPIC decision, the capacity and the production per day. So so I expect that early next year, if even without this sanction happen, we would see more increase on the activities in Saudi Arabia. But if the sanction will happen very quickly, let me put this little bit earlier. Yeah. And let me just round up by asking you on your own expansion plans, you know, geographically. Do you also plan to do any gas or just sticking to the domain of oil for the time being? No, actually, we do both oil and gas in all the countries we operate, specifically in Saudi, we do gas offshore. We do gas onshore. But again, we today operate in 13 countries. And these countries include areas in the Mediterranean and also in Southeast Asia where there are some gas activities. So gas is an important part of our drilling activities. So so our expansion, as is just to summarize, is happening in it in the Middle East, including areas like with oil company Qatar Energy, where we are one of the largest producers today, we have three assets in Qatar and with the new acquisition, we may have a full jackup operating there primarily in oil and gas in Qatar. Also, South East Asia was tough. Mm hmm. Yeah. So interesting. Great to have you. On the day after this deal was announced to Mohammed through his group CEO. Thank you so much for joining us. And coming up, the IMF says Saudi Arabia will not need to make further spending cuts even if oil prices fall. We'll find out what that means for the economy as it weans itself off oil dependence. This is Bloomberg. The IMF says Saudi Arabia has cut spending enough this year and probably won't need to make further fiscal adjustments even if crude oil prices weaken. The fund sees the kingdom's fiscal deficit rising to 4% this year. That speak to the other chief emerging markets economist at Bloomberg Economics. And of course, you've been doing a deep dive into Saudi finances recently. Interesting out of the IMF saying that Saudi Arabia have already cut enough this year. I'm in broad agreement with the IMF. Let me just tell you what, I agree with them. I think I think the first agreement is that Saudi does need some fiscal adjustment and does need some spending cuts. I think we all agree on the second agreement. This doesn't have to be big and abrupt. It can be gradual and phased because there are still buffers in Saudi debt levels are low that are being external assets and so on. No, and the IMF has recommended something like a 4% reduction in spending. Now that's a recommendation. We also have to look at what's happening in the reality on the ground. And in the first quarter of the year, Saudi didn't cut spending relative to a year ago. But if you look at the data from the fiscal data for the second quarter of the year, there are spending cuts are happening mostly on CapEx. So I think we all agree that Saudi Arabia has a large spending of spending. A lot of prices are not meeting the spending and some rethinking is needed. The question is about the magnitude. Yeah, but there's actual evidence on the ground that the belt is starting to get tightened. The second quarter fiscal data is showing this, that this is happening. Okay. So that's on the spending side. On the revenue side, I want to take you back to Aramco earnings yesterday. The fact that, you know, that dividends, obviously, we know that performance linked dividends was was going to get squeezed anyway. But the dividend is still quite chunky, even more so than aramco's free cash flow. And it constitutes a big part of revenue for the Saudi government. What outlook do you see for revenues at the Saudi government level, especially in an environment where there are some headwinds coming through? So I think there's revenues basically two sources. One source is oil, which is the biggest one. And it's a question about what's going to happen to the oil market where the headwinds are that we're getting from our supply, from OPEC+, from tariffs, which are starting to show up in the US data as we saw last week. So that's a function of oil. The non-oil revenue is a function of new stuff that's going to be introduced, mostly taxes. That's probably not going to be not going to have something new that I think Are you going to get the big adjustments in Saudi where it matters for Aramco because the dividend should matter. That is in terms of the spending in Saudi Arabia. You know, the Saudi state is still the largest shareholder in Aramco, whether it's the state itself, the government or the PIC, and therefore they bring peace dividends to fund their spending. Ziad, always good to talk to you. Thank you so much. As are the chief emerging markets economist at Bloomberg Economics. Thank you. Well, that rounds up our show Horizons Middle East and Africa. I'm Gianni Versace in Dubai. Stay with us for DAYBREAK. Europe. This is Bloomberg.",

Asia stocks are on a third session of gains, but the focus is on India's upcoming RBI decision, which could come under pressure regardless of what the RBI does due to the narrow yield gap it has with the US. The report also mentions that President Trump's language towards India's economy has been described as being harsher and more aggressive.",
