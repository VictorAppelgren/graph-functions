  "description": "Apple is suing Oppo for allegedly poaching a member of its Apple Watch team to steal trade secrets on sensors and silicon chips.",
  "content": "Apple is suing Chinese consumer electronics company Oppo for poaching a member of the Cupertino giant\u2019s Apple Watch team to allegedly steal trade secrets.\n\nApple, represented by lawyers from Kirkland & Ellis, is bringing the lawsuit against the company\u2019s former sensor system architect Dr. Cheng Shi, and his new employers China-based Oppo and California-based Innopeak.\n\nDr. Shi now leads a team developing sensing technology at Oppo\u2019s U.S. office, according to a complaint filed by Apple on Thursday in the Northern District of California.\n\nWhat is Shi accused of doing?\n\nDr. Shi was a highly paid engineer at Apple between January 2020 and June 2025 where Apple says he had \u201ca front row seat to Apple\u2019s development of its cutting-edge health sensor technology, including highly confidential roadmaps, design and development documents, and specifications for ECG sensor technology,\u201d which helps Apple Watches measure heart activity, according to the complaint.\n\nApple accuses Dr. Shi of downloading 63 confidential documents on the company\u2019s shared drive for employees to a USB drive just three days before leaving. The documents allegedly included sensitive information on the technological capabilities of yet to be released products and \u201ctechnical specifications concerning hardware and software implementations\u201d of Apple\u2019s sensor products like temperature sensors in its Apple Watch offerings.\n\nBefore downloading the documents from Apple\u2019s shared drive onto his Macbook, Dr. Shi\u2019s internet search history allegedly revealed that he looked up \u201chow to wipe out macbook\u201d and \u201cCan somebody see if I\u2019ve opened a file on a shared drive?\u201d\n\nApple also claims that Dr. Shi stole confidential technical information from the team that is developing Apple\u2019s custom chips. Apple develops its own custom silicon chips for its Mac, iPhone, and iPad products. The company has also been working on designing custom AI chips for some time now, and the effort is considered key to CEO Tim Cook\u2019s AI overhaul.\n\nOppo is known for its high-tech smartphones, and the China-based company got some heat online back in 2020 for releasing what many deemed an Apple Watch clone.\n\nOppo\u2019s smartphones, although ano match yet to Apple\u2019s iPhones, do remarkably well in Asian markets, particularly in China, one of Apple\u2019s largest markets.\n\nAlong with Huawei and Xiaomi, Oppo has eaten away at Apple\u2019s China market share, causing Apple to fall off from the list of top five smartphone vendors in China in 2024. But the tech giant has recently started turning this narrative around: iPhone sales rose to the top spot in China in May, Reuters reported in June citing preliminary third-party data, driving an overall increase in global sales for Apple.\n\nAlthough Oppo does not do business in the U.S., the company does own and operate a \u201cresearch center\u201d in Silicon Valley under both Oppo and Innopeak\u2019s names, according to the complaint.\n\nOppo has not yet responded to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment.\n\nWhat does Apple say happened?\n\nApple points to evidence from Dr. Shi\u2019s work-issued phone, which allegedly shows his communications with Oppo senior leadership from April 2025 to until he left Apple at the end of June.\n\n\u201cThis week I\u2019ll inform my team about my resignation,\u201d he allegedly wrote in messages included in the lawsuit. \u201cLately, I\u2019ve also been reviewing various internal materials and doing a lot of 1:1 meetings in an effort to collect as much information as possible \u2013 will share with you all later.\u201d\n\nIn the month before he left Apple, Dr. Shi allegedly scheduled 33 one-on-one meetings covering projects he was not involved in, compared to an average of seven per month a year earlier.\n\nThen when he did resign at the end of the month, Dr. Shi did not tell colleagues that he would begin work at Oppo, but instead said that he was \u201creturning to China to tend to his elderly parents and had no plans to seek new employment,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nApple is seeking an injunction prohibiting Oppo from using Apple\u2019s trade secrets, and is asking the court to award restitution and damages in an amount to be determined at trial.",

      "text": "I get it\u2014the smartphone market is boring. Galaxy after iPhone after Pixel, year after year after year\u2014at least if you\u2019re in the U.S. Even if you\u2019re into phone tech, it can be hard to feel enthusiastic about the prospect of annual upgrades.\nIn Asia, however, the battle for smartphone supremacy is as brutal as ever. Chinese companies like Huawei, Vivo, and Xiaomi are still locked into breakneck competition, releasing multiple devices a year that put Western offerings to shame\u2014at least on paper. The Oppo Find X8 Ultra is one of the strongest recent examples. It\u2019s an all-around flagship phone that crams the very best of high-end specs into a sleek form factor. All things considered, I think it\u2019s the best camera phone available anywhere in the world.\nOppo Find X8 Ultra\nOppo\u2019s latest flagship Find X8 Ultra has everything you could possibly want from a phone\u2014except availability outside of China.\nPros\n- Unbeatable specs\n- Versatile camera system\n- Best-in-class image processing\nCons\n- Mediocre ultra-wide lens\n- Only available in China\nIt\u2019s not exactly a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, but Oppo\u2019s stated goal with the Find X8 Ultra\u2019s design was to pull off \u201cthe thinnest camera phone.\u201d At 8.78mm thick compared to its 9.5mm-thick predecessor, the Find X7 Ultra, Oppo has indeed slimmed the Find X8 Ultra down beyond any of its cutting-edge competitors. But because of its boxy, squared-off design, it doesn\u2019t necessarily seem that much thinner in the hand. This year\u2019s Xiaomi 15 Ultra, for example, is 9.48mm thick but has tapered edges that don\u2019t dig into your palms as much.\nThat\u2019s not to say the Find X8 Ultra is unwieldy. Oppo has basically achieved what it set out to here; it essentially feels like a very slightly thicker iPhone 16 Pro Max, which is a strong achievement considering the hardware. But the design is extremely straightforward and austere, which may or may not be to your taste. Oddly, the Find X8 Ultra looks near-identical to the base Find X8, while the mid-tier Find X8 Pro is sleeker and flashier than both.\nThe display is as good as you\u2019ll find on any premium phone. It\u2019s a 6.82-inch flat-sided OLED panel with a variable refresh rate (1 to 120Hz) and 1440p resolution. The Find X8 Ultra gets up to 1,600 nits bright in regular outdoor usage and peaks at 2,500 nits with HDR content. The bezels are equally slim on all four sides. It has Dolby Vision support and, more unusually, Oppo\u2019s Splash Touch technology to limit unwanted inputs when it\u2019s wet. I did make a point of testing this in a hot tub, for science, and the phone really does actually stay more or less usable even when it\u2019s covered in drops of water.\nI\u2019ll also mention the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, not just for its speed improvements over the X7 Ultra\u2019s optical reader, but for how Oppo improved the way you set it up\u2014now you can register your thumb by just rolling it in a circle a few times rather than tapping the sensor repeatedly with every part of the tip. Not the biggest deal in the world, but a welcome improvement if you\u2019re a weirdo like me who goes through that process dozens of times a year when testing new phones.\nAnother design quirk is Oppo\u2019s shift away from a mute slider switch, a popular differentiating feature on phones from its subsidiary OnePlus. There\u2019s now a customizable button on the top left of the phone called the Shortcut Button, and yes, it works more or less identically to the iPhone\u2019s Action Button\u2014right down to the full-screen UI that pops up when you choose its function. I\u2019m fine with the hardware change, but the implementation is a little brazen.\nElsewhere, the Find X8 Ultra\u2019s spec sheet includes what you\u2019d expect from the top shelf of Android flagships in 2025. The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite and the phone can be outfitted with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. (The base model has 12GB and 256GB, respectively.)\nThis is Oppo\u2019s first Ultra-class phone to include silicon-carbon battery technology, following its debut in the X8 Pro and a subsequent appearance in the folding Find N3. Basically, this allows Oppo to get a lot more capacity out of a smaller physical space\u2014despite its slimmer frame, the Find X8 Ultra\u2019s battery weighs in at 6,100mAh versus 5,000mAh on the X7 Ultra. As for charging, Oppo\u2019s own 100W SuperVOOC adapter can get you from zero to 100 percent in under 40 minutes, which is impressive considering the increased capacity of the battery. The Find X8 Ultra also supports wireless charging at up to 50W with a compatible proprietary charger. Between the fast charging and the large battery capacity, I\u2019ve found the phone unlikely to die on me in regular use. I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019ll never happen on a long day of shooting in the sun, but it\u2019s been as solid as any comparable phone I could name.\nThat brings me to the camera system, which\u2014as ever with \u201cUltra\u201d-class Chinese flagships\u2014is the main point of differentiation here. The Find X8 Ultra doesn\u2019t necessarily have the best hardware in every single category, but there\u2019s a strong case to be made that it\u2019s the most well-rounded and versatile camera system around.\nThe Find X8 Ultra\u2019s primary camera uses a 1-inch-type sensor, which is the class-leading standard for Chinese flagship phones; it\u2019s the same size as what you\u2019ll find on Sony\u2019s RX100 range of point-and-shoot cameras or Fujifilm\u2019s new X half. What this means in practice is that the lens you use the most gives you far more depth and dynamic range than what you get from an iPhone or Galaxy. The light-gathering ability is simply on another level, and you\u2019re able to separate subjects through shallow bokeh (background blur) without resorting to portrait mode, which often still shows imperfections between the foreground and background.\nThe Find X8 Ultra\u2019s telephoto lenses\u2014yes, there are two\u2014are also a particular strength. The 3x periscope camera has an unusually large 1/1.56-inch sensor paired to an f/2.1 lens with close-focus ability, allowing for excellent mid-range and macro shots with natural shallow depth of field. There\u2019s also a 6x f/3.1 lens with a 1/1.95-inch sensor. The one drawback is the 1/2.75-inch ultra-wide camera, which isn\u2019t necessarily weak next to the competition but does feel like a compromise in the name of thinness; previous Oppo flagships performed much better.\nOppo has also adopted a thoughtful approach to camera software. The regular photo mode turns out pictures along the lines of what you\u2019d expect from a high-end smartphone, with crunchy sharpness and HDR detail preserved in every shot. I think Oppo has the best color science in that sense, which is why phones like the Find N3 can outperform their hardware. But if you\u2019re not into the typical smartphone photo look\u2014which I personally am not\u2014you can swipe on over to the Hasselblad-branded Master mode, which gives you much more natural results right out of the box. While Master mode is fully customizable, its default settings tend to line up with what I\u2019d be aiming for when editing files from a dedicated camera.\nThis year, Oppo\u2019s image processing is aided by what the company calls a \u201cTrue Chroma Camera,\u201d a low-res sensor dedicated to capturing accurate color information across the frame for better automatic white balance. It\u2019s difficult to test exactly how the camera system would work without this additional hardware, but I did see impressive results in challenging situations like low-light portraits.\nThe shooting experience is also helped by the \u201cQuick Button,\u201d which is pretty much a facsimile for Apple\u2019s Camera Control. It gives quick access to the camera app and shutter release, but it\u2019s fully capacitive and much easier to press; I found myself using it a lot more often than I do on my own iPhone 16 Pro.\nThe Find X8 Ultra has a vastly more capable camera system than you can get on any smartphone sold in the US, and it trades blows with the best available from domestic competitors like Xiaomi and Vivo. That said, I can\u2019t really recommend anyone go out of their way to buy it unless they\u2019re based in China. I have personally found it to work well on my NTT Docomo SIM card in Japan, but I can\u2019t speak to bands or coverage wherever you might be reading this.\nOppo\u2019s China-focused version of ColorOS is pretty usable and comes with built-in compatibility for Google Mobile Services through a settings toggle, meaning you can use the Play Store and Google apps along with any third-party software that relies on Google\u2019s APIs. Still, an uninitiated Western user might feel blindsided by a bunch of Chinese bloatware and services they won\u2019t ever be able to use. The Find X8 Ultra\u2019s eSIM support is only accessible through the built-in ORoaming app, for example, and you can only pay for data through WeChat or AliPay.\nBut the bigger picture here is that the Find X8 Ultra demonstrates how Chinese phone makers are simply miles ahead of what\u2019s available in the U.S. and Europe. Whether you\u2019re shopping for a Galaxy, Pixel, or iPhone this year, you\u2019re getting a raw deal when it comes to pure hardware capability and camera performance. This phone launched at 6,499 yuan in China, which works out to around $900.\nGiven the present political climate, it seems less likely than ever that Chinese OEMs will find a way to sell their highest-end devices in the U.S. That\u2019s unfortunate for anyone interested in the best hardware available. The Oppo Find X8 Ultra will be my go-to camera phone until something better comes along, and I have a feeling that that something won\u2019t be available in the U.S. either. It\u2019s not like this particular phone necessarily changes the game\u2014Chinese companies have been leapfrogging Apple and Samsung for years.\nAll in all, the Find X8 Ultra is an awesome phone that\u2019s as good an example as any of what\u2019s capable today with modern mobile technology. I think it\u2019s clearly better than anything Apple, Samsung, or Google are selling in the U.S. today. Does that mean you should import it? Probably not. But it does mean you should raise your standards for the next time those companies try to sell you on new hardware."

      "text": "At this point, there\u2019s no denying the Apple Watch is the smartwatch to beat. It\u2019s feature-rich, massively popular, and when you wear one, it confers a certain sensibility about you, the tech-savvy consumer. But for the love of everything holy, can other smartwatch makers please stop trying to shamelessly ape the design?\nThe latest offender, if rumors are to be believed, is Oppo. Renders of Oppo\u2019s copycat smartwatch popped up on Weibo and Twitter and you don\u2019t need to be a genius to see the resemblance. The only significant difference is the right-hand side of the watch features two buttons instead of a digital crown.\nOf course, this is just a render\u2014we\u2019d have to wait to see if and when Oppo releases the smartwatch to see just how much it copies Apple\u2019s design. That said, Oppo is not the only tech company doing this. Just a few short months ago Xiaomi released the Mi Watch, which surprise surprise, looks just like the Apple Watch down to the crown. Can you guess what the Amazfit Bip looks like? Meanwhile, at a glance, Fitbit\u2019s Versa line also takes a cue from Apple. Many a time I\u2019ve worn one out in the wild, only for someone to mistake it for an Apple Watch.\nhttps://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-decade-smartwatches-actually-became-a-thing-1840663138\nBut this is bad for wearables as a whole\u2014if only for the sole reason it stifles creativity. Watches are not a monolith. While many people are fine with the Apple Watch\u2019s square face, there are plenty of readers who sound off in my comments and inbox about how it\u2019s not for them aesthetically. Round watches are classic, and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy watches are an excellent example of using that shape in a clever way via its rotating bezel. Honestly, it\u2019s way more intuitive to navigate through screens by swiping a finger around the edge, than using the Apple Watch\u2019s digital crown.\nSpeaking of, it\u2019s not as if everything about the Apple Watch\u2019s design is the best. The digital crown is the first thing that comes to mind. While it was initially meant to mimic the feel of traditional watches, it\u2019s often more of a hindrance in everyday use. I happen to wear the Apple Watch on my left wrist, which means I often accidentally bump it if I\u2019m wearing a big jacket. If you\u2019re not familiar with the Apple Watch, it means I\u2019m constantly bringing up Siri when I don\u2019t want to. Likewise, it was a bother when trying to track my boxing classes\u2014I could feel the crown occasionally push up against my hand wraps inside my gloves and somehow that would stop my session. In general, raised pushers on smartwatches can be more annoying than helpful and it\u2019d be great if smartwatch makers tried doing\u2026literally anything else with them. (Case in point, even Apple has filed a patent exploring a \u2018flat\u2019 digital crown that can recognize gestures.)\nI get that many Apple Watch knockoffs are meant to be cheaper smartwatches that get you the look and some of the features for a more affordable price. Heck, it\u2019s one of the main reasons to get a Fitbit Versa! That said, there\u2019s so much room to play with attractive and functional designs if all you want is basic activity tracking and notifications. The Fossil Hybrid HR isn\u2019t as accurate and doesn\u2019t do nearly as much as the Apple Watch, but it does the basics well. It also kicks the Apple Watch\u2019s ass in terms of battery life. Plus, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s much more stylish at a $200 price point. Withings is another smartwatch maker with affordable, elegant watches. Sure, they might not be quite as advanced (though Withings did get functional ECG onto a hybrid analog!). Then again, most of these knockoff watches aren\u2019t either.\nApple is the watchmaker to beat\u2014but a lot of that is because it\u2019s simply the best at introducing advanced features, maintaining a robust app ecosystem, and figuring out clever ways for the watch to interact with other Apple devices. And yet, this is a watch limited to iOS users and a huge chunk of the world is on Android. It seems a wasted opportunity to just peddle Android-users\u2014and anyone else who isn\u2019t in love with the Apple watch design\u2014a cheap lookalike that\u2019s probably worse. If you can\u2019t beat Apple on functionality, then the design should be the natural arena in which to set yourself apart.\nAs a wearables reviewer, it\u2019s also getting dangerously boring as an increasing number of watches opt to just copy everything Apple does in this space. It\u2019s disheartening to see all the new, exciting ideas come from just one company. So please, I\u2019m begging every wearables company out there. Just do something different.\n[BGR]"

      "text": "In a global all-hands meeting hosted from Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, California, CEO Tim Cook seemed to admit to what analysts and Apple enthusiasts around the world had been raising concerns about: that Apple has fallen behind competitors in the AI race. And Cook promised employees that the company will be doing everything to catch up.\n\u201cApple must do this. Apple will do this. This is sort of ours to grab,\u201d Cook said, according to Bloomberg, and called the AI revolution \u201cas big or bigger\u201d than the internet.\nThe meeting took place a day after Apple reported better than expected revenue in its quarterly earnings report, and that sent the company\u2019s stock soaring. The report came in a week already marked by great tech earnings results, partially driven by AI. But unlike Meta and Microsoft, Apple\u2019s rise in revenue was attributable to iPhone sales and not necessarily a strength in AI.\nIn the earnings call following the report, Cook told investors that Apple was planning to \u201csignificantly\u201d increase its investments in AI and was open to acquisitions to do so. He also said that the company is actively \u201creallocating a fair number of people to focus on AI features.\u201d\nCook echoed those sentiments in Friday\u2019s meeting, saying that the company will be making the necessary investments in AI to catch up to the moment.\nThe AI-enhanced Siri is back and allegedly better than ever\nApple has been working on integrating advanced AI into its product lineup for the past year or so under its Apple Intelligence initiative, which the company unveiled at the June 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference. The move was met by celebration and criticism even then: Apple\u2019s big bet on AI was coming a good year or so after competitors like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Meta scaled up their offerings.\nEven so, the company\u2019s progress on Apple Intelligence has been slow. Apple was supposed to unveil an AI-enhanced Siri earlier this year, and even released ads for the new iPhone with AI-enhanced Siri capabilities, but the Cupertino giant pushed that reveal back at the last minute, reportedly to next spring, though nothing is officially confirmed.\nThe switch-up caused major backlash from investors and customers, two major lawsuits, and a complete corporate overhaul.\nCook said on Friday that 12,000 workers were hired in the last year, with 40% of them joining research and development teams.\nThe leadership overhaul following the fallout of LLM Siri has \u201csupercharged\u201d the company\u2019s work in AI development, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said at the meeting.\nAccording to Federighi, the main problem with the LLM Siri rollout was that Apple tried to build a \u201chybrid architecture\u201d that utilized two different software systems. That plan has now been scratched, and Federighi seemed confident in LLM Siri\u2019s future this time around, claiming that the new \u201cend-to-end revamp of Siri\u201d will now be delivering \u201ca much bigger upgrade than we envisioned.\u201d\nChips are center stage\nAlso key to the new AI strategy, according to Cook, is chip development.\nApple has been working on designing in-house AI chips for some time now, according to a Wall Street Journal report from last year, in a project internally code-named ACDC (standing for Apple Chips in Data Center). The tech giant has reportedly teamed up with Broadcom to develop its first AI chip code-named Baltra, according to a report last year in The Information, and Apple is expecting to begin mass production by 2026.\nApple\u2019s lagging could be on-brand\nDespite being a global leader in tech and a household name in consumer electronics, Apple is nowhere near the top when it comes to the AI race.\nBut while that scares some Apple fans and investors, others think it\u2019s actually kind of on-brand. Tim Cook indicated Friday that he belongs to the latter camp.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve rarely been first,\u201d Cook said at the meeting. \u201cThere was a PC before the Mac; there was a smartphone before the iPhone; there were many tablets before the iPad; there was an MP3 player before iPod.\u201d\nCook has a point. Apple isn\u2019t necessarily known for spearheading new technology, but the company\u2019s strength comes from perfecting said technology and making products that become highly dominant in their respective markets. And if Apple makes the right moves in developing and scaling its AI product offerings, Cook could potentially add AI to that list as well."

      "text": "Apple was edged out of the top five smartphone vendors' list in China in the second quarter, as competition from domestic brands such as Huawei intensifies, according to a Canalys report.\nApple's market share in China shrank to 14% in the second quarter, the report released Thursday showed, from 15% in the first quarter and 16% in the same period a year ago.\nThe iPhone maker, which was the third-largest smartphone vendor in the second quarter last year, dropped to the sixth spot with about 9.7 million in shipments, according to CNBC calculations.\n\"It is the first quarter in history that domestic vendors dominate all the top five positions,\" said Lucas Zhong, research analyst at Canalys.\nApple's shipments have been declining since the first quarter when they dropped 25% year on year to 10 million units.\n\"Chinese vendors' strategies for high-end products and their deep collaboration with local supply chains are starting to pay off in hardware and software features. Honor's latest Magic V3, which leverages GenAI, has significantly enhanced the user experience of foldable devices,\" Zhong added.\nOn the other hand, Apple is facing a \"bottleneck\" in the Chinese market as it aims to \"stabilize retail prices and protect margins of channel partners,\" he said.\nLocalization of Apple Intelligence services in China will be an important move in the next 12 months, Canalys said, as Chinese brands are aggressively incorporating generative AI into their products.\nChinese brands dominate\nFrom April to June, Vivo reclaimed the top spot with 19% market share and 13.1 million units shipped \u2013 driven by strong offline and online sales during the \"618\" e-commerce festival.\nOppo maintained second place with 11.3 million units, buoyed by the launch of its new Reno 12 series. Huawei spinoff Honor came in third with 10.7 million units shipped, marking a 4% year-on-year increase.\nHuawei came fourth with 15% market share and 10.6 million shipment units \u2014 it had not made it to the top five a year earlier. Huawei's consumer business has seen a resurgence in China after the launch of its Mate 60 smartphone.\nXiaomi took the fifth spot with the buzz from its first electric car, the SU7, also contributing to solid sales of its K70 and flagship 14 series, Canalys said.\nOverall, the Chinese smartphone market grew 10% year on year in second quarter, with shipments exceeding 70 million units, Canalys said."

      "text": "Oppo has been a trendsetter on the smartphone stage, especially among foldable smartphones. The company\u2019s Find N5 folding smartphone is gaining traction for its claim that it\u2019s as thin as the USB-C port will allow. We\u2019ll know more details when the folding phone debuts globally in about two weeks. Sadly, this is one svelte smartphone we won\u2019t see coming to the States anytime soon.\nOppo\u2019s upcoming Find N5 flagship foldable is making the rounds on Chinese social media. Oppo\u2019s Find series product manager, Zhou Yibao, has been teasing the device since last month. The pictures thus far reveal that the Find N5 is thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro Max when splayed out in tablet mode. Another photo shows its thickness relative to a stack of physical credit cards.\nInformation about the specifications inside is still pretty limited, though Zhou summarized some specs on Weibo. The phone will rely on a \u201c3D printed titanium alloy hinge\u201d and will be the first Android device equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Extreme\u2014we\u2019re only on Elite here in the U.S., at least as far as phones you can buy outright. Zhou also teased IPX9 waterproofing despite the super-thin chassis, though the rating is not enough to keep out dust. The Find N5 will charge fast at 50W and provide reverse charging for other devices in tow.\nOppo is OnePlus\u2019s parent brand overseas. The companies merged years ago, and now, we look to what Oppo does with its marquee devices to see what\u2019s coming to the U.S. through OnePlus down the pipeline. There\u2019s still no successor to the well-rated OnePlus Open, which is why this has excited us all. The biggest problem with foldables is that they\u2019re still quite bulky when shut closed. It looks like manufacturers are all in the race to make theirs the thinnest they can be without compromising too much of the value-adds."

      "text": "Google just dealt OpenAI a major blow by scuttling a potential $3 billion deal, and in doing so, solidified a rising trend in Silicon Valley\u2019s AI arms race: the \u201cnon-acquisition acquisition.\u201d\nGoogle announced on July 11 that it poached key talent from the rapidly rising AI startup Windsurf, which until then had a reported $3 billion acquisition deal with OpenAI that has now collapsed. Instead, Google is paying $2.4 billion to hire away top Windsurf employees, including the company\u2019s CEO, and take a non-exclusive license to its technology, according to Bloomberg.\nBy poaching Windsurf\u2019s top brains but not acquiring the startup itself, Google achieved two critical goals at once: it nullified OpenAI\u2019s momentum and gained access to the startup\u2019s valuable AI technology.\nFriday\u2019s announcement is only the latest instance of what is increasingly becoming the go-to tactic for big tech companies looking to grow their competitive edge. Tech analysts have described it as a \u201cnon-acquisition acquisition,\u201d or more simply, an \u201cacqui-hire.\u201d\nThe Poaching Wars Have Begun\nOpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, ignited the current AI frenzy back in 2022 and has been the leader in generative AI ever since. But its market lead is being increasingly challenged by big tech competitors like Google and Meta, and it is now clearer than ever that elite AI engineers are the most valuable currency in this fight for dominance.\nRecently, OpenAI has found itself a primary target. After a series of high-profile talent raids by Meta, OpenAI executives described the feeling as though \u201csomeone has broken into our home and stolen something,\u201d in an internal memo obtained by WIRED.\nThe biggest aggressor in this new era of \u201cthe poaching wars\u201d has been Meta. In April 2025, CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted that the company had fallen behind competitors in the AI race. His comments sparked a multi-billion-dollar spending spree marked by strategic talent hires. Meta hired ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang, Apple\u2019s top AI mind Ruoming Pang, and Nat Friedman, former CEO of Microsoft-owned GitHub, as well as multiple top OpenAI employees tempted by multi-year deals worth millions. The company is gathering this talent under a new group dedicated to developing AI superintelligence called Meta Superintelligence Labs.\nSimilar acqui-hire deals were struck by Microsoft and Amazon last year. Microsoft hired top employees from AI startup Inflection, including co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who now leads Microsoft\u2019s AI division. Amazon hired co-founders and other top talent from the AI agent startup Adept.\nThis isn\u2019t Google\u2019s first rodeo with acqui-hiring, either. The tech giant inked a similar deal with the startup Character.AI roughly a year ago, which gave Google a non-exclusive license to its LLM technology and saw its two co-founders join the company.\nWhy Hire but Not Acquire: A Regulatory Loophole\nBeyond just being a symbol of a new era in the AI arms race, this surge in acqui-hires reveals a new playbook for Big Tech to grow its market dominance while sidestepping antitrust scrutiny. This tactic follows a period of intense regulatory pressure under former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chairwoman Lina Khan, whose administration cracked down on alleged anti-competitive practices in the AI industry.\nBoth Meta and Google are already under intense scrutiny from the FTC.\nMeta is awaiting a verdict on an antitrust trial over the FTC\u2019s claim that it holds a monopoly over social media. Google, on the other hand, has been dealt numerous antitrust defeats in the past year, accused of having monopolies in both internet search and online advertising. The company is awaiting the final results of a trial that could potentially see it forced to divest from its Chrome browser.\nEarly last year, under Khan\u2019s leadership, the Commission also launched an investigation into Microsoft, Amazon, and Google over their investments in AI startups OpenAI and Anthropic.\nUnder this cloud of regulatory pressure, it seems acqui-hiring is proving to be an easy way for Big Tech to get what it wants. The big names gain all the necessary access to the technology and top research talent of AI startups without having to go through the vetting hurdles of a formal acquisition.\nGoing forward, it is now up to the current FTC, under Trump-appointed chairman Andrew Ferguson, to define its stance on this practice. While not seen as the same kind of hardliner against Big Tech as Khan, Ferguson has largely continued to pursue the previous administration\u2019s investigations, even as President Trump has entertained Silicon Valley leaders at Mar-a-Lago.\nHow Ferguson\u2019s FTC and the Trump administration at large choose to respond, or not, to this new wave of regulatory loopholes will determine the future of American big tech and the AI industry as a whole."
