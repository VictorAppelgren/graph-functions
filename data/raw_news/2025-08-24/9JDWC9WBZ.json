  "content": "Why Airplanes 'Disappear' From Radar When Flying Over The Ocean\n\nRadar, which stands for radio detection and ranging, has been around for almost as long as controlled flight. Robert Watson-Watt and Arnold Wilkins conducted the first experiments that led to a working radar system in 1935. Today, we use radar for weather forecasting, speed detection, environmental monitoring, and, of course, aviation. Radar is used by air traffic control to monitor where an aircraft is and is also used by the airplane for collision avoidance systems and navigation. Because radar uses radio waves, it relies on a clear line-of-sights \u2014 the signal needs a clear path to the target, in this case a plane, and back. The curvature of the Earth and basic geography limit how we use radar. When a plane moves over the ocean and a few hundred miles from shore, the system can no longer see the plane. The signal may also be lost over remote and mountainous regions. If the plane's transponder is still working, the plane can still be tracked, but if that transponder fails, the plane can essentially disappear.\n\nCommercial aviation uses two types of radar systems. Primary surveillance radar, or PSR, bounces radio waves off of objects in order to detect them. It is used to show where an object is, but cannot detect identity or altitude. Secondary surveillance radar, or SSR, uses the plane's transponder, which reports altitude, speed, and the flight number. This system is crucial when planes fly where radar coverage is limited, using satellite to report their position. The process is remarkably simple. A transmitter relays a short but powerful burst of high-frequency radio waves. The transmitter is then shut off and a receiver is turned on, which listens for an echo from those waves. Because we know how fast radio waves travel, the distance of the plane can be measured from that echo. The process can also ascertain the speed of a plane by measuring the Doppler effect. Radar is not only limited by terrain and line of sight, but weather. Pilots use radar to detect and avoid bad weather because, in addition to causing turbulence, heavy rain can scatter or weaken radar signals. Additionally, technical issues on the ground are rare but can happen, such as the telecommunications outage at Newark Liberty International Airport, which affected its radar system.\n\nHow many modern planes have disappeared? Radar may be almost 100 years old, but the technology we use today is reliable, and it's difficult for a plane to simply disappear. A plane's transponder ensures that even when it flies beyond sight of the radar system, it can still be tracked. In 2014, however, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 did just that. We ranked this incident as one of the 10 worst aviation disasters. The Boeing 777-200ER was carrying 239 people when it took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia enroute to Beijing, China when it disappeared off of civilian radar. Military radar indicated that plane veered off course, and the transponder signal was also lost. Despite an exhaustive search, no main wreckage was found, though pieces of debris thought to have come from the plane were later recovered on various islands. A report from the Malaysian government eliminated mechanical or computer failure, indicating that the transponder must have been deliberately turned off. The Malaysia Airlines flight is the only modern example of a plane disappearing from radar and never being found. You may recall that In July 2025, an Antonov An-24 passenger plane disappeared off of radar in Russia, but the wreckage was found shortly thereafter. Most other cases of missing passenger planes that have never been located date back to the 1950s and 1960s or before, and technology has since come a long way.",

      "text": "10 Of Aviation History's Worst Accidents, And Why They Happened\nIn the century-plus since the Wright brothers lit the fuse on successful manned flight, technology and innovation have been racing toward continually increasing speed, efficiency, and safety in the air. Sadly, this hasn't been without a few missteps and tragedies. Even Orville Wright himself was significantly injured while his passenger Thomas Selfridge became the first casualty of an airplane crash in 1908.\nDisaster is unfortunately an integral part of advancement in many regions of progress, and this is no different for the scientific miracle of flight, although modern aircraft are tremendously safe modes of transit. In the years since the opening of what is today the oldest continuously operating airport in the world in College Park, Maryland (a site where the Wright Brothers would train army officers to fly), plenty of crashes, accidents, and failures have taken place.\nHere we are looking at 10 of the most infamous air travel incidents that have occurred, as well as the mistakes or failings behind the accident. However, these tragedies have created learning opportunities that improve the experience for everyone else. For that, humanity mourns the losses and collectively honors the victims of these and many other air travel incidents.\nThe 1937 Hindenburg disaster\n\"Oh, the humanity!\" These three famous words uttered by Herbert Morrison as the Hindenburg airship caught fire and came crashing down over Lakehurst, New Jersey have become some of the most enduring in modern history. Airships were a major technological innovation for their time, and for 30 years they shuttled passengers around the world in style and with good speed. The airship was roughly twice as fast as an ocean liner of the era, and thousands of flights brought passengers where they were going without incident. However, that changed with the Hindenburg's catastrophic end.\nIt's scandalous and exciting to think about the disaster that radically transformed air travel in a matter of seconds as an act of sabotage, but the evidence just doesn't support that conclusion. Instead, it's become clear that the hydrogen gas that filled the airship's balloon is the source of the calamity. Designed to use helium gas, the airship instead sourced its lift with a flammable alternative because of export restrictions placed on Nazi Germany by the United States.\nOn this journey, a leak in the airship's gas containment balloon exposed highly flammable hydrogen to an atmosphere charged with static electricity. While grounded by its landing line, the airship exhibited a significant charge difference that led to a static discharge from its fabric outer covering. The ignition of that leaking gas ultimately killed 36 people including one on the ground and brought airship travel to a screeching halt.\nBoeing 737 Max 8 crashes (and Max 9 mishaps)\nIn 2017, Boeing gained FAA certification for the 737 Max 8 design. Less than a year later, Lion Air Group took delivery of the company's first Max 8 aircraft. However, the airplanes were experiencing control issues and Lion Air Flight JT 610 becomes the model's first catastrophe in October 2018. Minutes after takeoff, the Max 8's sensor array initiated a dive maneuver that the flight crew couldn't fend off, leading to a crash into the Java Sea that killed all 189 people on board. In March the next year, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed in much the same way, killing all 157 crew and passengers.\nThe crashes were caused in large part from a redesign of the engine. Lifting the engine higher on the wing to accommodate a bigger overall design brought a side effect into play that had to be corrected. Most importantly, the dynamics of the design tended to shift the nose upward at too steep an angle, requiring additional steps to level off the aircraft.\nRather than redesigning the plane, Boeing introduced the MCAS software to automate the stabilization. However, this new equipment wasn't mentioned in the training materials, and reports indicate that it behaved erratically from essentially the very start of its service. The Max 9 hasn't crashed like its predecessor, but it's seen critical issues of its own. Most spectacularly, an inflight door blowout on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 in January 2024 led to the discovery of egregious production quality standards that allowed four bolts to be left off the door's build.\nThe January 2025 D.C. collision\nThe most recent disaster on this list is the January 2025 mid-air collision that took place near Ronald Reagan International Airport in D.C. The crash was the deadliest in American skies in over 20 years and involved a commercial jet and an army helicopter.\nAmerican Airlines Flight 5342 was struck by a Black Hawk helicopter engaged in training maneuvers. It's thought that the helicopter crew was wearing night vision goggles, which would have given them greater visibility facing ahead but limited their situational awareness. The helicopter crew appears to have seen the jet but received an incomplete transmission from the control tower with instructions on how to proceed in its vicinity.\nThe area is a hot spot for close calls and helicopters frequently occupy the skies in close proximity to commercial jets. In the aftermath of the collision which killed 67 people, new rules have been proposed to limit helicopter activity around two runways that pose a particular threat to general safety.\nThe 1996 Air Africa crash\nThe 1996 Air Africa crash is a bizarre chapter in aviation history. It's the deadliest accident in terms of ground casualty figures on record, while there were two deaths among those on board the plane.\nThis flight, which was slated for a journey from Kinshasa to Kahemba, was carrying cargo rather than passengers, contributing to the low fatality rate on board. However, it was the cargo that caused this disaster. The aircraft failed to complete takeoff as a direct result of a load weight exceeding the maximum take-off weight. Investigators were unable to determine the exact overage, but it's estimated that the aircraft may have been loaded with as much as seven tons of excess cargo.\nUpon failure to initiate the takeoff roll, the flight crew attempted to abort the flight but acted too late and didn't have enough runway left to complete the stoppage. The plane overshot the runway and rolled until it came to rest in the Simbazikita district of Kinshasa. At least 297 people on the ground were killed in the resulting impact and fire, while another 253 people were injured.\nThe 1979 Mount Erebus disaster\nFor a short time in the late 1970s, travelers departing from Auckland could hop aboard a flight that brought them all the way back to this metropolitan hub on New Zealand's northern island. The 11-hour journey wasn't a transit route, but rather one featuring a unique sightseeing opportunity. Air New Zealand ran these flights nearly due south for two years to bring travelers down to Antarctica. Along this route, passengers would catch a glimpse of Mount Erebus on the southern continent's Ross Island, the southernmost active volcano on the planet.\nThe trouble for Air New Zealand Flight TE 901 came down to a change in coordinates for the flight plan. The navigation center for the airline changed two coordinates during what was thought to be a minor heading adjustment, but it ultimately charted the flight path over Ross Island rather than McMurdo Sound.\nThe 12,450 feet of volcanic elevation on the island proved fatal for the tour. Instead of a low pass of around 2,000 feet over the water to catch the spectacular sights of Antarctica's glacial coastline, the plane crashed into the volcano as it made its voyage across the icy frontier. All 257 people on board were killed, and the collision with this towering natural feature marks the worst civil air incident in New Zealand.\n2014 Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappearance\nUnlike the other air disasters found on this list, the Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 incident remains unsolved. Rather than crashing and leaving behind heaps of evidence for investigators to piece together \u2014 such as the all-important black box \u2013 the aircraft simply seemed to vanish.\nAlmost an hour after it took off from Kuala Lumpur, the captain signed off by saying, \"Good night, Malaysian three seven zero.\" Nothing more ever came crackling over the radio. The little evidence that has been uncovered shows the flight turning off its transponder, and radar signatures suggest that it turned back to fly back over Malaysia and then eventually toward Sumatra. One final turn to the south completes the picture that remains with investigators and the world today.\nOver the next two years, search efforts scoured the Indian Ocean, and private exploration ventures also took on the task, but to no avail (although a previously undiscovered shipwreck was found). Nothing aside from a few bits of debris has ever been turned up to complete the picture and provide closure to the families of the 239 people on board. As a result, theories have run rampant as a result of this void in evidence.\nSome suggest the pilot intentionally killed himself and everyone else aboard the plane, while others suggest a hijacking \u2013 potentially even a sophisticated, remote operation. There's even a theory out there that American elements were responsible for rerouting the plane to secret it away on Diego Garcia military base in the Indian Ocean. The truth, unfortunately, will continue to elude the public until tangible evidence of the plane's fate makes it into the light.\nThe Turkish Airlines disaster of 1974\nReturning to air disasters with well-understood causes, the Turkish Airlines Disaster of 1974 is perhaps as straightforward as they come. The flight was scheduled to fly from Istanbul to Paris, after which it would perform a continuation on to bring passengers to London. The route was particularly full at the time of the accident as a result of strikes at British Airways, reducing alternatives for the itinerary.\nThe McDonnell Douglas DC-10 featured cargo doors that opened outward and could be closed without actually locking them back in position. The door might appear to be closed correctly, but its locking pins would not engage unless the latches were placed in the correct position. Reports indicate that instructions available on ensuring a correct closure were only in English and Turkish, and the baggage handler who closed the door before takeoff couldn't read either.\nAs a result, the cargo door was not properly sealed and a pressure imbalance grew as the plane gained altitude. About 10 minutes after takeoff an explosive decompression took place with the loss of the improperly secured door, and debris from the ejection downed one of the plane's engines. All 346 people on board the plane died in the resulting crash.\nThe 1996 Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision\nThe collision of two aircraft in mid-air is a grisly sight. Even with as many as 14,000 airplanes in the sky at any one time, extreme coordination and immense training help run a tight ship when it comes to managing the sky's traffic. Air crews rely on precise instructions from ground controllers in order to line up for even the simplest maneuvers in the air and on the tarmac. Misunderstandings frequently result in close calls, but those can quickly spiral into much more consequential events. The 1996 Charkhi Dadri Mid-Air Collision is an example of this.\nThe crash involved Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907 and Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 763. As Flight 1907 was entering the air space, the pilot was cleared to start his descent. However, the incident report indicates the pilot's lack of English language knowledge as a primary culprit in the collision that would soon occur. Rather than maintaining the altitude he was instructed to descend to, the pilot continued his pitch down, coming directly into the line of oncoming traffic and colliding with another aircraft.\nThe incident report suggests that the controller clearly stated, \"Maintain 150\" \u2014 meaning 15,000 feet \u2014 and warned the pilot about the Saudi flight ahead. It's possible that the next words: \"Fourteen miles now, roger 1907,\" and \"Traffic in 13 miles, level 140\" could have been picked up as an instruction to reduce altitude to 14,000 feet by a weak English speaking listener. Either way, the planes collided and killed everyone on board, resulting in 349 fatalities and India worst ever aviation disaster.\nThe 1985 Japan Airlines crash\nThe deadliest crash involving a single aircraft took place during a takeoff from the Tokyo-Haneda Airport. The takeoff went according to plan, but a few minutes into the climb a rupture in the tail segment of the plane depressurized the aircraft. The subsequent loss of the plane's tailcone and the vertical fin rendered many of its controls inoperable and the aircraft collided with the Osutaka Ridge. 520 people were killed in the crash, although there were, incredibly, four survivors.\nThe incident that eventually doomed this aircraft actually took place nearly a decade earlier. In 1978, the tail of Boeing 747SR-46 struck the runway on its second touchdown during a landing maneuver in Osaka. Significant damage was sustained, and intensive repairs were made to the aircraft.\nHowever, the efforts to return JA7119 to operation failed to fully repair the fuselage, and over the years fatigue cracks began to form in the aft section of the plane. Maintenance inspections never turned up these cracks, and this issue was given the space it needed to grow into a catastrophic point of failure.\nThe 1977 Tenerife Airport disaster\nThe Tenerife Airport Disaster took place in 1977 and earns the grim honor of being the deadliest air travel accident ever. The stress factors that led to this collision started just a short island hop away at the Las Palmas Airport on nearby Gran Canaria. A bomb exploded early in the afternoon there, and flights were diverted to Tenerife in the face of a potential second bomb. A congested tarmac resulted in strained communications between the tower and airplanes waiting for instructions at Tenerife.\nIn the heat of confusion, Pan Am Flight 1736 and KLM Flight KL4805 both engaged their radios at the same time, creating feedback in the KLM flight crew's cockpit. This obscured the reality that the Pan Am flight was still on the runway that the KLM flight was about to use to initiate a takeoff maneuver.\nThe KLM crew saw the Pan Am plane moments before impact and began to nose up, attempting to climb over the runway impediment. Sadly, it was too late. The two aircraft collided, with the Pan Am plane getting sheared in half and the KLM flight reaching the air briefly before coming back to ground around 150 meters away and engulfed in flames as it slid to a halt. All 248 occupants of the KLM aircraft were killed in the impact and resulting fireball, and 335 of the 396 total passengers and crew members of the Pan Am flight succumbed to the incident, resulting in a total of 583 casualties."

      "text": "Flying In And Avoiding Extreme Weather: How Pilots Handle Nature's Challenges\nAlmost everyone knows that airplanes are one of the safest ways to travel. But what isn't always clear is why this is the case, especially when aircraft can experience extreme weather and dangerous storms that are not common at ground level. Among the many things that passengers don't know about pilot's jobs is how much preparation goes into avoiding dangerous conditions.\nSlashGear has previously spoken to a pilot about advances in AI for air travel and how that might affect flights in the future. Now, we have discussed the issue of bad weather and how pilots handle the challenges that Mother Nature can throw at an aircraft with two veterans of the industry. Gary Baumgardner is a commercial airline pilot with 18 years of experience, and Capt. Brandon Meadows is a veteran who flew for the U.S. Navy and is currently a private pilot. The pair helped to explain the training, procedures, and actions that everyone involved in each flight will go through to keep passengers safe and aircraft in the air.\nAvoid bad weather from the get-go\nThe main strategy that pilots employ when it comes to bad weather is to simply avoid it in the first place. Pilots are trained to be risk averse, and that means flying into an area where adverse weather could affect the flight is something most would never purposely do. Speaking to SlashGear, Baumgardner explained that the aim when dealing with extreme weather is to go around it. \"We will usually navigate around the weather,\" he said. \"Especially weather that has convective activity. However, if we can't make it through extreme weather, we will either divert or turn around.\"\nSimilarly, according to Meadows, if a situation is deemed potentially harmful, then the aircraft will not carry on going forward. That could mean taking a different route, making a landing at a nearby airport, or even turning around completely and going back to where they came from. After all, the idea there is a safer part of the aircraft is a myth, so it's best to just avoid anything risky altogether.\nWhen asked about the possibility of encountering unavoidable storms and particularly bad weather, Meadows explained: \"If the weather cannot be avoided, and it's so bad that it's unsafe, then we do not go through it; we either land somewhere else that's close, or we turn around and go home if that makes more sense.\"\nAircraft are designed to be able to handle storms\nIf you've watched Hollywood films, you might think that any sort of storm poses a major threat to passenger jets. The truth is that the aircraft used by airlines are incredibly safe and specifically designed to be able to withstand bad weather. It is not uncommon for aircraft to be able to travel through thunderstorms, strong winds, and heavy rain without any ill effects. For example, the wings of an aircraft are flexible enough to move in turbulence without being damaged.\nWhile lightning strikes might seem frightening, like modern cars, aircraft are not at risk from being struck \u2014 it actually a few times every year The fuselage of a passenger jet effectively works as a Faraday cage, directing the electrical current across the exterior of the vehicle. A conductive path may also be created using embedded fibers or special screens to ensure the charge travels in a certain direction. Sensitive equipment inside the aircraft also has surge protection so electrical currents from lightning strikes don't cause damage.\nEvery aircraft has to go through a meticulous testing regime to make sure that every single part is capable of undergoing the kind of stresses they will typically encounter in the air. They are also regularly treated with anti-icing chemicals to keep ice from forming in areas that might cause problems.\nPilots do a weather check before takeoff\nEven before a passenger jet is in the air, pilots will be planning ahead and checking the weather. One of the important parts of their pre-flight checklist is to perform an official weather check. This in-depth process is more involved than simply loading up a weather app on a smartphone. Pilots have to rely on authorized data from the National Weather Service. This information is available through a variety of specialized apps as well as the official U.S. government aviation weather site.\nThe pre-flight weather check covers the entire route and destination, ensuring there are no nasty surprises waiting for along the way. If conditions around the airport aren't safe, the plane will not take off and pilots or air traffic control will ground the flight. Problems predicted for the journey will see the pilots work with air traffic control to plan detours and set a route that avoids any potential danger. Delays and cancellations may also be considered if the destination airport is expecting bad weather at the time the flight will arrive.\n\"Checking the weather consists of looking at from where the flight is departing, where the flight is landing, all the space in between, and the weather at an alternative airport at which we might land if the first choice for destination doesn't work out, either for unexpected weather or other reasons,\" said Meadows. \"This is typically called the local weather, destination weather, and en route weather, respectively. All of these are analyzed for the times we will be at those places, as well as the weather within about an hour before and an hour after.\"\nStay in constant communication\nCommunication is a key skill for all members of the flight crew and especially pilots. Standard operating procedures (SOP) have been put into place to keep communication efficient and accurate, giving pilots the ability to convey their thoughts with each other and air traffic controllers. After all, in an emergency situation time is of the essence and precision is important, so pilots are trained specifically to use certain words and keep in constant contact when necessary.\nWhen it comes to weather, air traffic controllers keep pilots updated on changes and forecasts. Speaking over radio, they will inform aircraft about potential storms and bad weather. They will also relay information from other pilots who may have experienced dangerous conditions that don't show up on radar. This keeps everyone in the air well informed about what is going on so they are as safe as possible.\n\"We also have radar from ATC and our own radar on our aircraft,\" said Baumgardner. \"Pilots and ATC also coordinate with each other. Pilots can pass along weather to other pilots and ATC. For example, an aircraft 100 miles ahead of us might pass on that FL350 is pretty turbulent. ATC will relay this to us and we can make adjustments.\"\nPlans, procedures, and checklists\nWhile pilots generally take what Meadows calls a \"commonsense approach to avoiding weather,\" there are all sorts of other things that they do to keep passengers safe and make sure aircraft are not damaged, too.\nThere are many plans, procedures, and checklists designed to keep pilots prepared and in control, regardless of the situation. In the case that something does go wrong, pilots can run through these checklists and find the relevant solution. This might include slowing the aircraft down so it experiences less stress and enabling or turning off certain systems so pilots have more direct control.\nSpeaking to inews, experienced pilot Martin Chalk discussed some of the other procedures that pilots follow during bad weather. These rules are in place to provide safeguards, such as having at least one pilot always wearing a seatbelt to prevent sudden changes causing injury. \"As pilots, one of you is always strapped in, in order to make sure that if unexpected turbulence occurs, one of you is capable of continuing to fly in the plane,\" explained Chalk. \"Personally, that never happened to me and it's very rare that a plane is knocked more than a few feet from where it should be.\"\nPrioritize passenger safety and comfort\nThere's another reason that pilots go out of their way to avoid bad weather outside \u2014 the comfort and safety of passengers. Even if an aircraft could safely travel through a storm without suffering damage or being at risk of crashing, pilots will tend to go around anything that might cause discomfort for those onboard the flight. \"We're trying to protect passengers from being injured as a result of being thrown about the plane, and passengers being hit by items that are thrown around the plane by the turbulence,\" said Chalk.\nFar fewer people would be prepared to fly if they knew that they'd experience turbulence frequently, as even brief moments of being bumped around can be uncomfortable and scary. That's also why pilots take extra care to warn passengers about potential turbulence or conditions that might affect the plane, even if there isn't a noticeable effect. If you've ever flown and seen the seatbelt light come on or heard an announcement from the pilot about bad weather but then not felt anything, that's a good example of pilots playing it safe and preparing for scenarios that could potentially be dangerous.\nAlways prepare for the worst\nBoth pilots that spoke to SlashGear confirmed that it is rare for unexpected weather to suddenly appear. The weather systems on a plane and the communication procedures with air traffic control means that pilots are not caught off guard very often. But in the few times that it might happen, it is important that pilots are fully prepared for the worst-case scenarios. Pilots are specifically trained to be able to fly in turbulence, keeping the aircraft level and the flight smooth thanks to countless hours on the simulator.\nAn aircraft's autopilot system can also be incredibly useful in unpredictable weather. Whereas pilots may overcorrect during turbulence or in storm conditions where the jet is being jostled, the autopilot should be able to adjust with more nuance without any of the emotion or stress of a human pilot. According to Chalk, autopilot can ably handle most turbulence these days.\nThankfully, the best commercial aircraft also come equipped with a variety of instruments that help pilots navigate during low light and visibility. Instrument Landing Systems give three-dimensional guidance when an aircraft is approaching an airport so they can line up correctly with the runway even when it is not possible to see much out the cockpit screen. In-flight sensors and systems, such as radar, can also provide a way to avoid obstacles and other aircraft while staying on route. If ice and hail poses a problem, pilots can switch on electrical de-icing systems designed to heat up the wings and other essential parts to stop ice forming."

  "argos_summary": "Radar relies on line\u2011of\u2011sight and transponders to track aircraft; over oceans or remote terrain the signal can be lost, as in the 2014 MH370 disappearance where the plane vanished from civilian radar after turning off its transponder.  The article reviews a range of historic aviation disasters\u2014from the Hindenburg to the 2025 D.C. collision\u2014highlighting how technology, human error, and design flaws have driven safety improvements.  It also explains how modern pilots use pre\u2011flight weather checks, real\u2011time ATC updates, and aircraft systems to avoid or mitigate severe weather, prioritizing passenger comfort and safety.  Together, the pieces illustrate the evolution of radar, accident investigation, and operational procedures that keep air travel increasingly safe.",
