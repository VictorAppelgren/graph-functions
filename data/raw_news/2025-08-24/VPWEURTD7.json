  "title": "Trump is making it harder than ever to have an American holiday \u2013 and tourists are taking note",
  "description": "A swath of new policies are making travel to the US tricker than ever, despite a fall in visitor spending. So, why doesn\u2019t Trump want us?",
  "content": "Donald Trump loves a bit of American exceptionalism. But here\u2019s one accolade that we won\u2019t be hearing from the mouth of the president: the US is set to be the only major economy to suffer a decline in tourism spending this year. The verdict comes from the World Travel and Tourism Council, which presumably knows its stuff. And while it is just a projection, it isn\u2019t exactly out of line with some of the things that we know are happening, with foreign visitors to the States down by 12 per cent year on year. Given the pugilistic state of American politics, arguing over whether Mr Trump should share part of the blame or not is always a risky exercise. But the Maga hardcore would have to admit that this administration hasn\u2019t helped itself when it comes to international tourism, showing, at best, a cavalier attitude towards America\u2019s image abroad. Of course, the president isn\u2019t exactly anti-tourism. He\u2019s repeatedly talked up events like the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, which are expected to draw more than 50 million visitors between them. But all too often, tourism seems to take second billing to other, more Trumpian goals. Border security would be the obvious one. But while Trump may have triumphed in last year\u2019s election by promising to secure the border, did anyone really cast their vote on the basis that more tourists would end up shackled and deported for minor infractions, as we\u2019ve seen with cases like Rebecca Burke \u2013 the young woman from Wales detained for 19 days?\n\nSome in the administration have suggested that one potential problem with foreign visitors is the possibility that some \u201coverstayers\u201d will slip through the net and end up abusing their visa to work in the grey economy. Already, the Trump administration has shaken up the rules around student visas with that concern in mind. Now the US government is set to do similar with tourism, hence the requirement for certain nationals (currently those from Zambia and Malawi) to cough up a $15,000 (\u00a311,300) security deposit in order to obtain a tourist visa. The administration has suggested that the pilot programme could be extended to other nations too, in time. To be fair, Britons should be safe either way, given that US government numbers suggest that only a tiny fraction of us take liberties with our ESTA visa-waiver permits. Though those travellers who need a full visa may end up having to cough up for the new $250 visa integrity fee, included within Trump\u2019s signature \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d. In any event, arguing over the exact details is only part of the picture. The bigger point is that this bombardment of tougher rules will have already sent a signal around the world that the US is becoming less welcoming to tourism. And that\u2019s before we get to the increased fixation with vetting travellers\u2019 social media, like the French researcher refused entry in the spring after border officials found messages and memes that were seen as anti-Trump. Again, the underlying issue is nothing new: US border agents have long had the right to ask to see your phone. But the Trump administration appears to be pursuing the policy with a new ferocity, stretching the definition of national security to include what many of us would consider legitimate political opinions. \u201cIf you look at the memo from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services this month, you can see this administration is taking a hard stance on what they perceive as anti-American attitudes,\u201d says Christi Jackson, a partner with immigration lawyers Laura Devine. \u201cThat is always going to be difficult to define in reality, particularly when people are criticising the US government in ways that would be considered freedom of speech elsewhere.\u201d Could this chilling effect be contributing to the reported 10 per cent decline in tourism from some European countries? While it\u2019s impossible to say for sure, it is worth noting that surveys do suggest that some travellers (including Britons) are less likely to visit the US under the current administration. Still, we Europeans are a tiny drop in the ocean compared with the Canadians, who make up nearly one quarter of foreign tourists. But thanks to Trump\u2019s aggressive rhetoric towards their country, many have been voting with their feet: Canadian visitors to the US were down 33 per cent in June compared with the previous year.\n\nMaybe some Maga hardliners will take pride in the fact that the lily-livered liberals are staying away. But for now, the situation doesn\u2019t appear to have dented the political consensus that tourism is a good thing for the States. In Congress, some Republican and Democrat politicians have put aside their differences to lobby for tourism. In March, the Democratic congresswoman Dina Titus \u2013 whose seat contains part of the Las Vegas Strip \u2013 coordinated a bipartisan letter, calling on the Trump administration to nominate a tourism secretary within the commerce department. Despite being signed by some Republican lawmakers, the plea has so far been ignored. Others have made the case that a huge tourism push would help the president in achieving another of his perennial obsessions \u2013 the trade deficit. During the first Trump administration, the economist and former Trump adviser Stephen Moore authored a paper arguing that tourism generates the biggest trade surplus for the US outside of financial services. The administration has already found one way to increase the money flowing in from foreign visitors, with provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill to increase the ESTA charge from $21 to $40 at some point in the future. The higher charges won\u2019t be popular with families heading to Orlando or New York, but they will bring in more revenue for US government coffers. In the end, though, perhaps the best way to convince the president would be the obvious one. From rip-roaring stock markets to huge investment deals from oil-rich Gulf monarchies, Donald J Trump loves to tout his bombastic statistics about how America is doing better than ever. Surely it wouldn\u2019t be too difficult to add tourism to that list? Right now, though, it seems like tourism is pretty low on the pecking order in Maga-town. If current trends persist \u2013 and that bombshell World Travel and Tourism Council prediction comes true \u2013 maybe that will change. Particularly if some of Trump\u2019s political adversaries start making mileage out of the situation. If that fails, we can opt for the one gambit that will definitely get his attention: let\u2019s all holiday in Canada instead.",

While the president promotes large sporting events, tourism remains a low priority, prompting bipartisan efforts\u2014such as a letter from Congresswoman Dina Titus\u2014to appoint a tourism secretary and highlight the sector\u2019s economic benefits. The piece concludes that unless the administration shifts its focus, the decline could persist, potentially prompting travelers to choose Canada instead.",
