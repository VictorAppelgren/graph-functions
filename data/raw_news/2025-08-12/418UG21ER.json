  "description": "Apparel giants to raise U.S. prices as Trump imposes tariffs on key garment-making countries. Brands like Uniqlo, Adidas, Nike, Gap, Puma face billion-dollar impacts.",
  "content": "Apparel heavyweights from Japan's Fast Retailing to Germany's Adidas warned they will likely raise U.S. prices as President Donald Trump moves ahead with steep new tariffs on key garment-making hubs, Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh.\n\nWhat Happened: Bangladeshi apparel will face a 20% levy, Cambodian goods 19%, and Vietnamese shipments 20% after a last-minute compromise, White House statements and Reuters documents confirm.\n\nThose three countries supplied more than one-third of the $79 billion in clothing the United States imported last year, according to a U.S. International Trade Commission study.\n\nAdidas, which relies on Vietnam for the bulk of its U.S. sneakers and jerseys, has already absorbed \"double-digit euro-millions\" in extra duties this spring and warned the next round could \"directly increase the cost of our products for the U.S. with up to 200 million euros during the rest of the year,\" chief executive Bj\u00f8rn Gulden told Nikkei last Friday.\n\nFast Retailing, parent of Uniqlo, operates 74 U.S. stores and sources from 60 Vietnamese, 27 Bangladeshi and 19 Cambodian factories. Chief financial officer Takeshi Okazaki said during an earnings briefing in July that the chain will \"adjust prices flexibly, taking into account tariffs and other costs and determining a balance between price and value.\" A company insider told Nikkei that some fall and winter items \"will have no choice but to rise.\"\n\nSee Also: Trump\u2019s \u2018Big, Beautiful Bill\u2019 Is Investing $200 Billion In Medicaid, Not Cutting It, CMS Chief Says: \u2018But We Want An Appropriate\u2026\u2019\n\nNike Inc. NKE expects its tariff bill to climb by $1 billion this fiscal year and has already begun \"surgical\" hikes. Gap Inc. GAP in May said that it projects an additional $250 million to $300 million in costs if double-digit duties stick across Asia, while Puma warned of an 80 million Euro hit that could tip it into an annual loss, states a Reuters report.\n\nWhy It Matters: Industry groups warn that layering country-specific rates on top of Trump's baseline 10% global duty risks amplified inflation in the clothing aisle. Still, the White House argues higher tariffs will \"level the playing field\" and encourage more U.S. manufacturing, positions echoed by trade adviser Kevin Hassett.\n\nWith the first holiday orders already booked, most brands say sticker shock will hit early 2026. Until then, retailers face a balancing act between raising prices enough to cover a sudden tax bill, but not so much that cost-conscious shoppers walk away.\n\u2022 Tesla Says Retaining Elon Musk Is \u2018More Important Than Ever Before\u2019 As Company Begins Process To Grant 96 Million Share Stock Award",

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first. They can help you:\n- Create a tax-smart drawdown plan\n- Manage and grow a diversified investment portfolio\n- Maximize Social Security strategies\n- Protect assets for your spouse or heirs\n- The matching service is fast and free\u2014and designed specifically for individuals with significant investable assets who are looking for personalized, high-quality advice.\nTake the first step toward a more confident retirement. If you have at least $100,000 in investable assets, WiserAdvisor can match you with a pre-screened fiduciary financial advisor in your area.\nBook here to get started; no cost, no obligation.\nBenzinga Money is a reader-supported publication.

The immediate pain falls on fast\u2011fashion giants like Shein and Temu, whose one\u2011off parcels lose duty\u2011free status after Trump killed the de minimis loophole.\nSee also: Nancy Pelosi Called US-China Trade \u201cA Job Loser:\u201d Old Remarks Reemerge Amid Trump Tariff Push\nStill, Julia Hughes of the United States Fashion Industry Association warns, \"Ultimately, no one wins.\" Once forward hedges expire, the Budget Lab at Yale predicts apparel prices will leap 64 % in the short run and remain 27 % higher long term.\nConsumers Shift Before Stickers Do\nShoppers are already bracing. Three\u2011quarters told Empower they've begun \"trading down,\" swapping new releases for dupes, thrift finds, or outright secondhand buys. \"Customers are doubling down on resale because they know there is no tariff to pay,\" says Christos Garkinos of luxury\u2011resale site Covet by Christos. Re\u2011commerce is forecast to hit $292 billion by 2029, but Hughes cautions that supply can't keep pace with demand. As inventories thin and fall collections roll in, the delayed sticker shock will land, just not before retailers exhaust every last tariff\u2011free T\u2011shirt.\nImage via Shutterstock\nRead next: Scientists Detect Possible Signs Of Life On Distant Planet K2-18b\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), discussed the impending changes to the Medicaid system and the escalating drug costs.\nDr. Oz Defends Medicaid Reforms, Highlights $200 Billion Boost\nDr. Oz appeared on \u201cFace The Nation\u201d on CBS News on Sunday to discuss the upcoming changes to the Medicaid system as part of the Big, Beautiful Bill Act. The bill, which is a part of the Trump administration\u2019s policy, is set to bring significant changes to the Medicaid system.\nWhen asked about the potential impact of these changes on Medicaid, Dr. Oz clarified that the administration is actually increasing the Medicaid budget by $200 billion. He stressed the need for a fair return on this investment, ensuring that Medicaid patients do not face unaffordable drug prices.\n\u201c\u2026we\u2019re going to invest in Medicaid as is required, but we want an appropriate return on that investment, \u201d stated Dr. Oz.\nDr. Oz addressed the issue of drug costs, which have been a growing concern. \u201cOne thing that Medicaid patients should not face are drug prices they can\u2019t afford,\u201d he added. He explained that the President\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on drug-producing countries like India and the EU is a step towards preventing drug manufacturers from passing on the increased costs to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Dr. Oz emphasized the need for a fair pricing system that benefits the American public and the global community.\nDr. Oz also touched on the administration\u2019s plans to allocate 7% of Medicaid funds to rural hospitals, with an additional $50 billion being invested in workforce development and technology to improve healthcare delivery in these areas.\nTrump Targets Drug Prices, Reshapes Medicaid Rules\nThe Trump administration has been taking significant steps to address the issue of rising drug prices. Earlier in the year, President Trump issued a 60-day ultimatum to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, demanding that they lower drug prices in the U.S. or face severe consequences. This move was part of the administration\u2019s efforts to make healthcare more affordable for Americans.\nThe changes to the Medicaid system, as outlined in the Big, Beautiful Bill, are expected to have a significant impact on healthcare in the U.S. The bill, which includes cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other social welfare programs, has been a topic of debate, with critics expressing concerns about its potential impact on vulnerable populations.\nREAD MORE:\nImage via Shutterstock\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "President Donald Trump\u2018s tariffs on Chinese imports have increased Nike Inc.\u2018s NKE costs by $1 billion. As part of their mitigation strategy, the athletic giant plans to start implementing price hikes in the fall of 2025.\nCheck out the current price of NKE stock here.\nWhat Happened: The Beaverton-based company disclosed the substantial tariff impact during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, outlining a four-pronged approach to offset costs while maintaining brand positioning.\nChief Financial Officer Matt Friend confirmed the company will implement a \u201csurgical price increase\u201d in the United States with phased rollouts starting in fall 2025.\nThe tariff headwinds are expected to pressure gross margins by approximately 75 basis points for fiscal 2026, with a greater impact in the first half.\nNike\u2019s comprehensive mitigation strategy includes optimizing sourcing mix, partnering with suppliers and retail partners, implementing selective price increases, and evaluating corporate cost reductions. The company expects to fully offset the billion-dollar impact over time as these actions are implemented and annualized.\nThe tariff challenge comes as Nike reported mixed fourth-quarter results, with revenue of $11.1 billion beating estimates of $10.72 billion despite a 12% year-over-year decline. Earnings per share of $0.14 exceeded forecasts of $0.12 by 16.67%.\nWhy It Matters: Nike\u2019s sourcing strategy will significantly shift production allocation. Currently, China represents roughly 16% of footwear imports into the United States, but the company expects this to decline to high single digits by fiscal 2026.\nFriend emphasized that \u201cmanufacturing capacity and capability in China remains important to our global source base\u201d despite elevated tariffs.\nCEO Elliott Hill acknowledged the challenging environment while expressing confidence in Nike\u2019s turnaround strategy. The company is implementing its \u201cSport Offense\u201d reorganization to drive growth through sport-specific innovation and marketing while cleaning up marketplace inventory.\nPrice Action: Nike shares rose 2.81% on Thursday to $62.54 and jumped another 10.73% in after-hours trading following its fourth-quarter earnings release.\nWhile Nike ranks low on Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings overall, the stock is showing a favorable short-term price trend.

TSLA has begun the process to award CEO Elon Musk with the compensation award amid uncertainty over the previous $56 billion pay package.\nCheck out the current price of TSLA stock here.\nElon Musk To Get 96 Million Tesla Shares As Compensation\nTaking to the social media platform X on Monday, Tesla shared a letter addressed to the shareholders of the company, announcing that it will begin the process to compensate Musk. The new pay package is worth around $29 billion.\n\"Today we announce an important first step in compensating Elon Musk for his extraordinary work at Tesla,\" the company said in the statement on X, highlighting that Musk hasn't received \"meaningful compensation in eight years\" since 2017.\nNo \"Double Dip\" For Musk\nThe company also said it was \"more important than ever before\" to keep Musk as CEO, as Tesla is at \u201ca critical inflection point that has the potential to create continued extraordinary value,\" for the shareholders.\nThe statement, issued by Board members Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, stipulates that Musk would receive over 96 million shares in Tesla, each of which trades at just over $300, after anti-trust approval, but says that the shares have a holding period of five years unless Musk has to \"cover tax payments or the purchase price.\"\nHowever, if the Delaware court reinstates Musk's $56 billion pay package, he must forfeit the current compensation. \"To put it simply, there cannot be any \u2018double dip,'\u201d the statement said.\nMusk Fears Losing Control Over Tesla Amid Dwindling Sales\nThe announcement follows Musk expressing fears of losing control over Tesla, as the billionaire had denied any personal loans tied to his shares in the EV giant. \"It is worrying in that I don't want to build millions of robots and then be potentially ousted by activists,\" Musk said.\nThe comments come at a difficult time for the company, with sales figures dwindling in multiple markets throughout the world. Tesla's sales in Denmark, Sweden and France declined for the seventh consecutive month.\nDelaware Court Ruling And Musk\u2019s $56 Billion Pay Package\nThe letter also comes in as a Delaware court in 2024 had overruled Musk\u2019s $56 billion pay package, which was approved by the members of Tesla\u2019s Board. Elsewhere, Tesla\u2019s board is set to hold its annual shareholder meeting in November, with experts like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives saying Musk\u2019s pay package would be in focus.\nTesla scores well on Momentum and Quality, while offering satisfactory Growth, but poor Value.

      "text": "Tariffs Work \u2014 and President Trump\u2019s First Term Proves It\nFor the first time in decades, the United States will see fair trade as President Donald J. Trump announces tariffs to level the playing field for American workers and businesses.\nDespite the rhetoric from politicians and the media, studies have repeatedly shown tariffs are an effective tool for achieving economic and strategic objectives \u2014 just as they did in President Trump\u2019s first term.\n- A 2024 study on the effects of President Trump\u2019s tariffs in his first term found that they \u201cstrengthened the U.S. economy\u201d and \u201cled to significant reshoring\u201d in industries like manufacturing and steel production.\n- A 2023 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission \u2014 which analyzed the effects of President Trump\u2019s Section 232 and 301 tariffs on more than $300 billion of U.S. imports \u2014 found the tariffs reduced imports from China, effectively stimulated more U.S. production of the affected goods, and had very minor effects on downstream prices.\n- According to the Economic Policy Institute, the tariffs implemented by President Trump during his first term \u201cclearly show[ed] no correlation with inflation\u201d and had only a fleeting effect on overall prices.\n- Economic Policy Institute: \u201cFollowing implementation of Sec. 232 measures in 2018\u2014and prior to the global downturn in 2020\u2014U.S. steel output, employment, capital investment, and financial performance all improved.
