  "title": "At Hot Chips 2025, Microsoft outlined the security measures it is using to protect Azure against the growing cybercrime pandemic",
  "description": "Cybercrime is the third largest global GDP behind America and China",
  "content": "\u2022 Microsoft has revealed how it protects Azure with an Integrated HSM chip\n\u2022 Cybercrime reportedly worth $10.2 trillion annually, making it the world\u2019s third-largest economy in 2025\n\nMicrosoft has revealed more on the custom-built security chip it deploys across every Azure server, aiming to counter what it calls a cybercrime \u201cpandemic\u201d now costing $10 trillion annually.\n\nThe Azure Integrated HSM, which was first announced in late 2024, is the centerpiece of a wider security architecture the company outlined at the recent Hot Chips 2025 event.\n\nA slide Microsoft showed there claims the global cost of cybercrime is currently $10.2 trillion - meaning it now ranks as the equivalent of the third-largest economy in the world.\n\nThe trillion-dollar estimate places cybercrime behind the United States and China, but ahead of Germany and Japan, and also far bigger than the entire AI market.\n\nMicrosoft said the scale of the threat requires both architectural and operational changes.\n\nAs ServeTheHome reports, the company listed a number of statistics at the event, including that Azure already spans more than 70 regions and 400 data centers, supported by 275,000 miles of fiber and 190 network points of presence, along with employing 34,000 engineers dedicated to security.\n\nTo take on the cybersecurity problem at a hardware level, Microsoft moved from a centralized hardware security module model to its own Azure Integrated HSM.\n\nThe custom ASIC is designed to meet FIPS 140-3 Level 3 requirements, providing tamper resistance and local key protection within servers.\n\nBy embedding the chip in each system, cryptographic functions no longer need to pass through a centralized cluster, reducing latency while enabling tasks such as AES, PKE and intrusion detection locally.\n\nServeTheHome noted building an in-house chip required trade-offs. Instead of scaling hardware security modules at a cluster level, Microsoft had to size them for individual servers.\n\nThe result, the company argued, was a balance between performance, efficiency and resilience.\n\nThe tech giant also presented its \u201cSecure by Design\u201d architecture at Hot Chips, part of its Secure Future Initiative.\n\nThis includes Azure Boost, which offloads control plane services to a dedicated controller and isolates them from customer workloads, and the Datacenter Secure Control Module, which integrates Hydra BMC, and enforces a silicon root of trust on management interfaces.\n\nConfidential computing, backed by trusted execution environments, extends protection to workloads in multi-tenant environments.\n\nCaliptra 2.0, developed in collaboration with AMD, Google and Nvidia, anchors security in silicon and now incorporates post-quantum cryptography through the Adams Bridge project.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 These are the best data recovery tools you can use right now\n\u2022 Microsoft struggling to sell Copilot to corporations because they want ChatGPT\n\u2022 Windows 11 Pro vs Windows 11 Home: which version is right for you?",

      "text": "Microsoft is struggling to sell Copilot to corporations - because their employees want ChatGPT instead\nCopilot is struggling to win over workers\n- Microsoft is trying to push its AI chatbot Copilot, but is hitting roadblocks\n- Copilot is struggling against rival ChatGPT\n- ChatGPT launched much earlier, giving the model a head start\nAI chatbot models like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot are gaining huge traction in the workplace and beyond, but OpenAI's model is reportedly starting to show dominance in the business world.\nA Bloomberg report has claimed even businesses which have purchased Copilot plans are struggling to convince users to make the switch.\nIt is not the only customer to report issues, as workers shun Microsoft Copilot in favor of ChatGPT, which is used more at home and thus become more familiar to many.\nA head start\nMicrosoft does use OpenAI\u2019s models to power Copilot, and offers very similar features to ChatGPT, with information summaries, email drafting, data analysis, and image generation.\nThat being said, ChatGPT\u2019s momentum and existing user base seems to be giving the chatbot the edge.\nAs of June 2025, ChatGPT has almost 800 million weekly active users, and 3 million paying business users, whereas Copilot has stagnated a little, with 20 million weekly users for the past year.\nTheoretically, the race should be a little more even, since Windows is such a dominant operating system in the professional world. Microsoft salespeople have traditionally been able to use Windows compatibility as an effective selling point, but that\u2019s no longer the case, the report suggests;\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\n\u201cThe company\u2019s [Microsoft\u2019s] salespeople knew ChatGPT dominated the consumer chatbot market, but expected Microsoft to own the enterprise space for AI assistants thanks to decades-long relationships with corporate IT departments. But by the time Microsoft began selling Copilot to businesses, many office workers had already tried out ChatGPT at home, giving the chatbot a first-mover advantage.\u201d\nDespite negotiating with companies such as Volkswagen, Accenture and Barclays, which all signed deals for over 100,000 accounts in agreements worth \u2018tens of millions\u2019 a year, Microsoft still lags behind OpenAI in its user base, and organizations are having to encourage workers to use the chatbot.\nThe news comes after Microsoft has announced largescale layoffs, with between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs worldwide expected to be cut - amounting to nearly 3% of the firm\u2019s workforce - just two years after 10,000 personnel were made redundant (5% of the workforce).\nYou might also like\n- Take a look at our picks for the best AI tools around\n- Check out our choice for best antivirus software\n- Generative AI isn't biting into wages, replacing workers, and isn't saving time, economists say\nEllen has been writing for almost four years, with a focus on post-COVID policy whilst studying for BA Politics and International Relations at the University of Cardiff, followed by an MA in Political Communication.

      "text": "Best data recovery software in 2025 \u2013 all the top picks for PC, Mac, and more\nThe best data recovery software ranked and reviewed for Mac and PC\nThe best data recovery software can help you recover accidentally deleted or lost files on your mobile, PC, Mac, hard drive, or external storage device.\nDeleting a file doesn't necessarily mean it's completely scrubbed from your device. Instead, the space it occupied is marked 'free' and can be overwritten - but if you have avoided making any modifications, you can usually retrieve the file.\nFor my top pick, EaseUS. It performed consistently well in our testing, and offers a fantastic advanced data recovery tool to help restore lost files. that being said, for advanced users with some experience in data recovery, Stellar is definitely the go to.\nIn order to help keep your important data safe, take a look at my picks for the best cloud backup, and don't forget to make additional copies of your data with the best disk cloning software.\n- We've also listed the best free file recovery software.\nReader Offer: Get 25% off on EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard\nEaseUS Data Recovery Wizard helps you rescue deleted photos, documents, and more from Windows or Mac computers, hard drives, SSDs, USB sticks, and memory cards\u2014even after accidental formatting. Its easy-to-use interface and smart deep-scan technology quickly locate recoverable data without technical hassle. Use code TECHRAD25 for your deal.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best data recovery software in full:\nBest data recovery software overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEaseUS isn't overstating the 'Wizard' part of this software's title \u2013 it really is 'wizard', really good at what it does. EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard is straightforward to use, taking you step-by-step through the recovery process.\nRun EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Pro quickly enough after disaster has occurred and it'll be able to resurrect just about everything, from inadvertently-deleted partitions to virus-ruined files.\nDuring all our tests EaseUS ran incredibly quickly. It detected the virtual drives and ran scans in seconds. In our first test, EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard lived up to its name, as it was able to retrieve all of the files on the drive which had previously been deleted from the Recycle Bin.\nThe utility also performed well on our test on a drive which had been formatted after the file had been deleted, recovering 76% of the missing files. We were particularly impressed that EaseUS was able to recover the filenames too.\nWe also ran a test simulating a damaged drive. EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard immediately recognized it as a \"lost partition\", where we were able to preview all of the deleted files, complete with filenames.\nNot only is this utility one of the best we've seen for data recovery but the full package is still one of the more affordable solutions we've seen for resurrecting crashed RAID setups \u2013 certain packages hide this functionality away in their premium versions. While there are definitely more advanced recovery packages out there, and certainly some cheaper ones, this is the one we'd keep on our shelf for those not-so-special occasions.\nThere are various pricing options, from monthly to yearly, or alternatively, a Lifetime upgrades license. Costs start from around $70 a month all the way up to a one-off fee around $150 for lifetime access.\nYou can, however, get 25% off any of these prices if you enter the code AFF-TECH-RAD at checkout.\nUpgrading to a paid license is expensive on paper, but a one-off lifetime fee could represent great value for money. Plus, just generally, the app's great performance, EaseUS's responsive customer support, and a tidy user interface makes EaseUS' offering a strong contender.\nRead our full EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Pro review.\nBest data recovery software for advanced users\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nStellar Data Recovery is one of the most popular data recovery services for businesses and for good reason. The platform comes with several scan options, meaning you can tailor the scan for the type of data loss that has occurred. This saves time if you\u2019ve deleted an important file and realized straight away, meaning there\u2019s no need for a full system scan.\nThe platform also comes with advanced search capabilities, making it easy to identify and extract the most critical data.\nAnother important feature of Stellar Data Recovery is its support for all file formats and drives. It is an adaptable provider that will recover data from hard drives (internal and external), memory cards, flash drives, and optical media like CDs and DVDs.\nDuring our tests we found that Stellar was able to recover files that had been deleted from the Recycle Bin without any issue whatsoever. It had less success with drives which had been formatted, only being able to recover around half the files. When we simulated a corrupted hard drive however, Stellar was able to recover 80% of the missing files.\nThere's a free version available which allows you to recover up to 1GB of data. There's no limit on the number of files you can 'preview' from within Stellar Data Recovery though, so you can check to see which files are recoverable.\nTo actually attempt to recover anything, however, you have to pay for a license annually rather than monthly, with pricing starting at around $60 in a three-tier annual renewal system.\nFor partition recovery, for example, you'll be shelling out around $90 for the Professional tier, while 'photo and video repair features' come with the $100 Premium tier. The $60 Standard tier simply offers unlimited data recovery - the least they could do, for that money.\nRead our full Stellar Data Recovery review.\nBest data recovery software for Mac\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOne of the most popular data recovery tools, Disk Drill, is available for both Windows and Mac.\nWith a range of features and a choice of free and premium versions, Disk Drill is designed to recover data from hard disk drives, solid-state drives, USB flash drives, SD/CF cards, digital cameras, and even smartphones. Disk Drill's website boasts that any lost data file type can be recovered, from almost any data loss scenario you can think of.\nBut we weren't just going to take their word for it, so we decided to put Disk Drill to the test. We were pleased to see that scans of the attached drives completed in just a few seconds.\nThe \"Preview\" feature is also essential, as it allows you to examine files in a way that's more difficult with the \"Recovery Fault\" which doesn't always assign correct filenames to data.\nIn our first test, the utility was able to find all the deleted files that we'd sent to the Recycle Bin. Our next test was on a drive which had been formatted after the files had been deleted. Disk Drill proved itself equal to the task and was able to produce all of the original files, with filenames intact.\nFor our final test, we simulated a corrupted/damage drive. Although the drive itself wasn't visible in Windows Explorer, upon launch Disk Drill proudly proclaimed \"Woohoo! Lost Partitions Found!\". It then recovered all of the files, though the filenames for two of them were missing. Passing with flying colors, then.\nDisk Drill's complete collection of features for every imaginable platform and scenario is impressive enough. Its ability to effortlessly mount and read a previously unmountable drive and recover the data from it within a comparatively small timeframe proves that Disk Drill is a recovery tool that you should be considering.\nThe free version of Disk Drill only allows you to recover up to 500MB of data, which most likely won't cut it. Pricing for the PRO version comes in the form of a one-time license fee rather than monthly or yearly cost, at around $108 for the software with lifetime upgrades which could make it most cost-effective in the long haul for a small business with thinking about costs.\nLarger businesses looking to support up to ten users with unlimited activations should note, however, that it'll cost them $598.\nRead our full Disk Drill data recovery review.\nBest data recovery software for device coverage\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhile there are plenty of Data Recovery products on the market, very few are as comprehensive as AnyRecover. The utility is available not just for Windows and Mac but is also designed to recover data from iOS and Android devices.\nAnyRecover touts itself as a data recovery solution for over 500 data loss scenarios for over 2000 different types of devices. The website also claims that over 1000 file formats are supported.\nIn our first test with AnyRecover, we found it was able to recover 92% of files that had been deleted from a drive, with filenames intact.\nThe second test was performed on a drive which had been formatted after the files were deleted. In that case AnyRecover was able to successfully restore 64% of the missing files, without their filenames.\nOur final test simulated a corrupted/damaged drive. AnyRecover didn't see this at first but as soon as we clicked \"Couldn't Find Location\" from within the utility, the drive appeared and scanning began. AnyRecover was able to restore all but one of the missing files with their filenames.\nAnyRecover can be downloaded free of charge from the main website by clicking \"Try it Now\". You can use the free version to 'Preview' certain file types and recover up to 100MB of data in up to 8 files.\nIf you choose to buy in, AnyRecover can be installed on up to 3 devices and 2 PCs. It's 79.99 for a monthly subscription. However we recently found that this had been reduced to $59.99 as part of a promotion, and as of August 2025, that's still the case. Similarly, a yearly subscription is typically $99.99, but we spotted reductions to $79.99. A lifetime licence usually costs $159.99, but is $99.99 right now.\nIt seems a little bizarre to purchase a one-month plan, in our opinion, and especially at the moment when lifetime access is just $40 more.\nIf you've missed this offer, don't worry: software companies always pull flash deals and sales out of their hats, and it's always worth checking back sooner rather than later, and waiting for your time to strike. That's good advice for any product on this list, really.\nRead our full AnyRecover Review.\nBest interface\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOntrack EasyRecovery comes in a number of different options, all intended to help provide the complete recovery of data under a range of different data loss conditions.\nA free version allows you to recover up to 1GB, so isn't going to be particularly helpful except as a tester for most people. The free version also limits the size of recovered files to 25MB.\nThe Home edition allows for the recovery of files and folders that have been accidentally deleted, though it can also recover them after a virus infection.\nThe Professional edition allows you to create disk images as well as recover data from CDs and DVDs, while the Premium edition doesn't just have the ability to clone HDDs and SSDs, but can also repair corrupted photos or videos.\nThe Technician and Toolkit editions are even more powerful, allowing for lost or reformatted RAID volumes, but also come with commercial licensing for commercial use, working across Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.\nDuring our tests we found the \"deep scan\" feature to be buggy, as the utility froze each time we tried to use it. We had more joy with quick scans however.\nOur first test was on a drive where the files had been deleted from the Recycle Bin. Ontrack Easy Recovery was able to restore all of them in seconds, including the filenames. We didn't have much success with the drive which had been formatted after the files were deleted : some system files were recovered but not the ones we'd placed on there.\nOur final test was a simulation of a corrupted/damaged drive. In this case Ontrack Easy Recovery's \"Can't Find Drive\" feature instantly displayed the lost partition. At this stage the utility became unresponsive. This may have been down to a defective data cluster on the drive itself though, so we'd still recommend installing the free version of the utility to try to 'Preview' files on lost partitions.\nPrices start from around $70 annually, with monthly subscription options available.\nRead our full OnTrack Data Recovery review.\nBest for enterprise\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOnce the darling of free backup solutions for the home user, CrashPlan has since shifted its focus to the SMB space, with its CrashPlan for Small Business offering.\nAnd CrashPlan is certainly a favorite around here \u2013 in fact, our official company machines here at TechRadar all run Crashplan, and it's saved our bacon on more than one occasion. It's not quite the same as the traditional file recovery apps that we've covered in this article \u2013 it's a backup service first and foremost \u2013 but it's so comprehensive, and good at what it does, that it almost counts.\nCrashplan stores absolutely everything. It chugs away in the background and makes full, detailed backups of your entire machine starting with the newest files first. It then sifts everything into virtual buckets so you can get quick access to the files that matter most.\nCritically, though, Crashplan even stores files you've deleted. You can switch this feature off, but we wouldn't: your backups are fully encrypted, so even those deleted files will be safe from prying eyes, and you never know when you might need to retrieve that long-discarded (or virus-removed) file.\nPricing starts from $10 a month per endpoint, with up to 100 endpoints covered in the small business plan. Enterprise users will need to get a custom quote direct from the company, which typically implies that you'll be paying a good deal more than that.\nRead our full CrashPlan review.\nQuick overview\nProvider: | EaseUS | Stellar | Disk Drill | AnyRecover | OnTrack | CrashPlan |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nDevices: | Windows, Mac, HDD/SSD, SD, USB/Pen Drive, NAS, more | Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, HDD/SSD, SD, USB/Pen Drive, NAS, more | Windows, Mac, iOS (via Mac version), Android (via Mac version), HDD/SSD, SD, USB/Pen Drive, NAS, more | Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, HDD/SSD, SD, USB/Pen Drive, NAS, more | Windows, Mac, HDD/SSD, SD, USB/Pen Drive, NAS, more | Windows, Mac, Linux, more |\nQuick Scan: | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | N/A |\nDeep Scan: | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | N/A |\nRecovery Rate: | 99.7% | 98.6% | Not advertised | 99.7% | 85% | N/A |\nFree Recovery: | Yes (Up to 2GB) | Yes (Up to 1GB) | Yes (Up to 500MB) | Yes (Up to 100MB) | Yes (Up to 1GB) | No |\nFile Preview: | Yes (Free) | Yes (Paid) | Yes (Free) | Yes (Free) | Yes (Free) | Yes (Paid) |\nSupport options: | Phone, email, live chat, remote assistance, tutorials | Phone, email, support tickets, tutorials | Email, live chat, tutorials | Email, support tickets, tutorials | Phone, email, support tickets, tutorials | Email, support tickets, live chat, tutorials |\nLifetime price: | $149.95 | $99.99 | $89 | $99 | None ($71.99 per year) | N/A |\nBest free data recovery software\nAs you would expect, some of the best data recovery software is only accessible if you're willing to pay for it. Luckily, for those home users who only want to recover a small amount of data, there are some free options available.\nMany paid services will offer a free version with limited features to help you recoup a small amount of data and then try and convince you to pay for the full version. There are also completely free data recovery utilities which may allow you to retrieve your lost files.\nIn this guide, we'll explore some of these free options. Before getting started, remember that each time you use a drive from which data has been deleted you're risking that the system will overwrite the data.\nThis is why it's best to install data recovery utilities to a separate device to the one from which you want to recover.\nThe best free data recovery software in full\nBest free data recovery software overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nStellar Data Recovery is one of the best data recovery tools we\u2019ve used, with highly customizable searches, a huge file-type library, and deep scan abilities. However, while a number of paid plans are available, there is also a free tier available.\nStellar Free Data Recovery Software offers up to 1GB of free data recovery for both Windows and Mac users. This enables users to retrieve deleted, lost, and unavailable objects from a hard drive, USB stick, or almost any other storage device. All of the advanced data recovery tools are otherwise available. This includes the ability to 'preview' from within Stellar Data Recovery, so you can check to see which files are recoverable even if you're over the 1GB free limit.\nDuring our tests, we found that Stellar was able to recover files that had been deleted from the Recycle Bin without any issue whatsoever. It had less success with drives which had been formatted, however, only being able to recover around half the files. When we simulated a corrupted hard drive however, Stellar was able to recover 80% of the missing files. Scans were completed in seconds.\nOverall, Stellar Data Recovery is a great file retrieval tool with powerful advanced options for business. In its simplest form, it enables anyone to retrieve lost data from a computer or external storage device. Paid subscriptions are a little expensive, but the free program\u2019s impressive performance and user-friendly interface mean it's well worth using.\nThe only concern would be whether 1GB of free recovery is enough for your needs, or if one of the paid tiers would be worth considering instead.\nRead our full Stellar Data Recovery review.\nBest free data recovery software for file size\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDMDE Free Edition \u2013 or, to give it its full title, DM Disk Editor and Data Recovery Software \u2013 helps you recover files from your hard drive that you have lost due to accidental deletion, hard drive problems, a virus attack, or some other grave misfortune.\nThis is the free edition of a program for which there are paid-for versions, so it should come as no surprise that there are a few limitations \u2013 but none that should put you off.\nThe free version of DMDE is only available for personal use, and it's only possible to recover files that are currently visible in the selected directory. You can't, for example, select a folder from the directory tree and recover it. On top of this, recovery is limited to 4,000 files at a time, but there's no limit on how many files you can recover if you break it down into batches of 4,000 or fewer.\nWhen visiting the DMDE website to download the Windows GUI version of the program, we found it was available only as a ZIP file. This triggered a Windows Defender alert, which we had to bypass. We were then able to download the archive and extract the folder.\nThese extra hoops are more hassle than a simple installer, but on the plus side, DMDE can be run directly from the folder to where it's extracted. You can run it from any location, including directly from a USB stick - vital when av risk overwriting data you're trying to get back.\nThis is especially important if you're trying to recover data from your main hard drive, as downloading any extra data to it risks overwriting existing files, making them much harder to recover.\nIf you're feeling particularly adventurous, you can even venture into disk editing mode or reconstruct RAID configurations as part of your disaster recovery program.\nDuring our tests, DMDE was able to recover all files successfully with filenames intact from a drive where they'd been deleted from the Recycle Bin. The utility was only slightly less successful with the drive that had been formatted after the files were deleted, recovering 92% of the files without the filenames.\nWe were particularly impressed how DMDE handled our simulation of a corrupted/damaged drive. The utility was able to recognize the lost partition immediately and recovered all of the original files including their filenames without issue.\nThe unforgiving interface has been made more helpful in recent versions through pop up hints, although these can be annoying once you've mastered the program as there's no obvious way to switch them off.\nStill if you can get past this, you'll find DMDE is an essential and powerful file recovery tool that could save you serious heartache.\nRead our full DMDE Free Edition review.\nBest free data recovery software toolkit\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRecuva is a full recovery toolkit, dealing with deep scanning, retrieval of data from damaged drives, extracting files from removable devices, and more. Although it does come with a paid-for version like the above, the free version is definitely worth checking out.\nIt's not the most comprehensive tool, but it's certainly powerful enough, particularly given that the pro version also adds disk imaging tools for taking full backups of your drives.\nPerhaps Recuva's most interesting feature is one that's contrary to its main aim: using its secure delete capability, you can completely obliterate files. This is less surprising when you discover that Recuva's developers Piriform also created the world famous file-deletion tool CCleaner.\nNote that usually files are only ever truly deleted when they're overwritten by another occupying the same space on the drive \u2013 otherwise, it's merely the reference to their data in the OS that's removed.\nBy overwriting each of their bits repeatedly with zeroes, even the most advanced data forensics tool won't be able to get them back. Perfect for those highly sensitive documents that absolutely need to stay deleted.\nMoving on from file deletion to file recovery, Recuva performed fairly well in our tests. It was able to recover all data intact with filenames from the drive whose files had been deleted from the Recycle Bin.\nWe were also able to use Recuva's \"Deep Scan\" feature to restore 76% of files from a drive which had been formatted after the files were deleted, though some of the filenames were missing.\nOur final test was a simulation of a corrupted/damaged drive. In this case sadly Recuva was unable to detect the drive, so no recovery could take place.\nOne of our favorite features, is that at the end of each scan Recuva will display a summary of exactly how many files have been recovered and the time it took. Scans usually completed in seconds, so this may be one to consider if the drive containing your missing files can still be mounted by your operating system.\nRead our full Recuva review.\nBest free data recovery software for partitions\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPresented as a pair of tools rather than a single integrated solution, TestDisk and PhotoRec together recover data from both lost partitions and files.\nTestDisk takes care of the partition side of things. The fact that it's a command line tool with no graphical interface might be off-putting at first. If can set this to one side though, there's help on hand to guide you through the process of working with your drives. TestDisk offers support for so many file systems, it should cater to most eventualities.\nPhotoRec is the component for recovering files. It's available with a command line interface, but unlike TestDisk there's also a GUI for less confident users. In Windows this is qphotorec.exe. This works in largely the same way as the CLI tool, with the options displayed in a single window rather than a step-by-step series of commands. Recovered partition images can be checked in TestDisk using the terminal.\nPhotoRec is cross-platform and can be run as a portable app from a USB stick, which means you don't have to install it on your PC and risk accidentally overwriting the data you want to recover.\nBoth TestDisk PhotoRec passed all our tests with flying colors. The first test was performed on a drive attached to the virtual machine where the files had simply been deleted. The utility detected all the files within seconds and listed them by type. They were all recovered intact and opened without issue.\nWe next tested QPhotoRec using a drive that had been formatted after the files were deleted. Once again QPhotoRec didn't disappoint. It recovered a number of files, amongst which were the original ones which had been deleted, complete with their filenames.\nWe were eager to see if the utility could go 3/3 so, next tested QPhotoRec on a drive with a corrupted volume header. QPhotoRec displayed it as a \"missing\" partition in the drop down menu, from which once again we were able to recover all the missing files intact with their filenames.\nThis is the only data recovery utility we've reviewed to date which has been able to recover all deleted files in every one of our tests. This is all the more impressive considering this is free and open source software, so doesn't have subscription fees to pay for developers to work on it round the clock.\nRead our full TestDisk and PhotoRec review.\nBest free data recovery software for file preview\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDespite the inclusion of the word \"pro\" in the name, this program is still free; there is, in fact, no non-pro version.\nThe look of UnDeleteMyFiles Pro may be rather dated, but don\u2019t let that put you off too much as there are multiple tools included here, not just data recovery. Recovery can be a little hit and miss as there is no indication of the quality (or recoverability) of files \u2013 you just have to hope that the files that are found are in a reasonable state.\nWe found this to be the case during our tests as when we scanned a drive where the files had been deleted it detected all but one of them including their filenames. However when we tried to restore the files, we found they wouldn't open, either being empty or corrupted.\nThe utility's \"File Recovery\" scan was unable to find any files on the drive that had been formatted after the files were deleted. We had the same results when using the \"Media Scan\" feature.\nWhen we tested with a simulated corrupted drive, UnDeleteMyFiles Pro wasn't able to see this at all, so no recovery could take place.\nWhen it comes to data recovery, there aren't really all that many options other than the ability to search for particular types of files to reduce the size of the list you have to sort through. There's no indication of the quality of files, as we saw when we attempted to restore deleted ones only to find they couldn't be opened.\nOne saving grace of this utility is that it contains a disk snapshot tool which can create an image of your drive as a single file. This allows you to attempt data recovery without risking making things worse. You can also send the image to professional data recovery services if necessary, which is a much better option than mailing your entire device to them.\nThere's also a secure file deletion tool, and email recovery.\nBest free data recovery software for recovery prediction\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhen it comes to ease of use, it's hard to beat Wise Data Recovery. Although this free data recovery software doesn't have a wizard-led interface, there are no complicated configuration settings to worry about either.\nTracking down recoverable data is a simple matter of selecting the drive you want to check and clicking 'Scan'. Alternatively, you can use keywords to search for recoverable files so you don\u2019t have to wade through quite so many results.\nWhichever route you choose, recoverable data is presented in an Explorer-like tree structure that makes it easy to tell where it was originally stored. Like all the best free data recovery software, Wise Data Recovery uses a traffic light system to indicate the health of files (and therefore how likely it is that you'll be able to recover them intact, and there's a file preview feature so you can identify files that have been detected.\nYou can recover individual files, or entire folders at once, but selecting numerous files in several locations means performing several operations.\nThe free version of Wise Data Recovery is one of the most generous free photo recovery options you\u2019ll find anywhere. Its 2GB recovery limit is better than most no-cost rivals, and you can use the free download on an infinite number of systems and with no time restrictions.\nOur first test was on a deleted drive whose files had been emptied from the Recycle Bin. Wise performed a scan in less than 3 seconds and was able to recover all the original files with their filenames intact.\nWise Data Recovery didn't do quite so well on the drive that had been formatted after the files were deleted. In that case only around half the files were recovered. With one exception the filenames were intact.\nFinally we ran a scan on our simulated corrupted drive. The utility was able to recognize the \"Lost Drive\" almost immediately and recovered all the original files, with filenames intact.\nRead our full Wise Data Recovery review.\nBest free data recovery software for user experience\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFinding recoverable data with EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Free is very simple: select a drive or folder and wait for a few minutes while it completes its scan.\nYou can browse through the recoverable data using a Windows Explorer style interface and filter them by type or opt to search for specific files. Data recovery is effective, but the Deep Scan option is very slow, so you'll need to be patient.\nThe installation of this software is a mixed experience. The installer, importantly, advises not to install to the same drive that you want to recover data from because this could overwrite data and render it unrecoverable. It also, sadly, tries to enrol you in a customer experience improvement program, without explaining what this entails.\nIt's worth noting that the free version only allows for the recovery of up to 2GB of data, so it's not going to be suitable for all circumstances, but it will be enough to get you out of most sticky situations.\nWe had a hard time actually receiving this free allowance during our tests, as after attempting to recover a 100MB folder on a 512MB drive just three times, our allowance was reduced to around 200MB. It's possible the 2GB limit may apply to the size of the drive being scanned instead of the amount of data recovered.\nHowever, during all our tests EaseUS ran incredibly quickly. It detected the virtual drives and ran scans in seconds. In our first test, EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard lived up to its name, as it was able to retrieve all of the files on the drive which had previously been deleted from the Recycle Bin.\nThe utility also performed well on our test on a drive which had been formatted after the file had been deleted, recovering 76% of the missing files. We were particularly impressed that EaseUS was able to recover the filenames too.\nWe also ran a test simulating a damaged drive. EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard immediately recognized it as a \"lost partition\", where we were able to preview all of the deleted files, complete with filenames.\nRead our full EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Free review.\nBest free data recovery software for Mac\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOne of the most popular data recovery tools on macOS, Disk Drill is now available for Windows.\nDisk Drill is designed to recover data from hard disk drives, solid-state drives, USB flash drives, SD/CF cards, digital cameras, and even smartphones. The website boasts that any lost data file type can be recovered, from almost any data loss scenario you can think of.\nThe \"Preview\" feature is also essential, as it allows you to examine files in a way that's more difficult with the \"Recovery Fault\" which doesn't always assign correct filenames to data.\nWe were pleased to see that scans of the test drives completed in just a few seconds.\nIn our first test the utility was able to find all the deleted files that we'd sent to the Recycle Bin. Our next test was on a drive which had been formatted after the files had been deleted. Disk Drill proved itself equal to the task and was able to produce all of the original files, with filenames intact.\nFor our final test, we simulated a corrupted/damage drive. Although the drive itself wasn't visible in Windows Explorer, upon launch Disk Drill proudly proclaimed \"Woohoo! Lost Partitions Found!\". It then recovered all of the files, though the filenames for two of them were missing.\nThis means that Disk Drill is one of the very few data recovery utilities to have passed all our tests with flying colors.\nDisk Drill's complete collection of features for every imaginable platform and scenario is impressive enough. Its ability to effortlessly mount and read a previously unmountable drive and recover the data from it within a comparatively small timeframe proves that Disk Drill is a recovery tool that you should be considering.\nThe free version of Disk Drill only allows you to recover up to 500MB of data. After that you need to pay a one-time lifetime license fee. Overall, this is an excellent recovery utility for both Windows and Mac.\nRead our full Disk Drill data recovery review.\nBest free data recovery software for simplicity\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOntrack EasyRecovery claims to be one of the best data recovery software applications available on the market. It was developed by a provider of file recovery services who has been in business for 35 years.\nThe program touts itself as being both simple to use as well as powerful enough to help you recover from a wide variety of data loss situations.\nThe Free plan provides up to 1GB of data recovery. There's also a size limit of 25MB on recovered files, though you can 'Preview' lost files to check if they can be recovered with the paid version.\nDuring our tests we tried to run the \"Deep Scan\" feature, only for the utility to become unresponsive each time the scan reached 99% whilst trying to read a particularly nasty data cluster.\nRegular scans on the other hand ran extremely fast. Our first test on the drive where the files had simply been deleted then emptied from the Recycle Bin Ontrack EasyRecovery recovered all the files with the filenames intact.\nIt wasn't quite so successful with the drive that had been formatted after the files were deleted. In that case some system files were recovered but none of the ones we deleted.\nOur final test was on a drive with a corrupted volume header. Ontrack EasyRecovery's \"Recover From\" has a \"Can't Find Drive\" option, which we clicked and the external hard drive was displayed immediately.\nOn the first scan, the utility was able to restore the lost partition in order for it to be scanned. (We noticed that it still didn't appear in File Explorer however).\nWe then tried to run a regular scan. Unfortunately this was the point at which the utility became unresponsive, simply saying 0% scanned. We left it this way for around 15 minutes before being forced to exit via Ctrl + Alt + Del.\nWhere Onetrack EasyRecovery falls down is the rather binary options offered for data recovery. Our experience was that the utility can do a superficial scan that retrieves only a few files or a huge in-depth sector by sector scan which crashes the app.\nIdeally we'd like to see some fine-tuning options, such as searching for 'raw' data for files or the ability to stop a scan cleanly before it's complete to review what data's been recovered.\nRead our full Ontrack EasyRecovery review.\nBest free data recovery software for iOS\n10. MyRecover\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMyRecover is a comprehensive and free data recovery software from AOMEI. Previously known as AOMEI Data Recovery, the software is available for both Windows and iOS.\nWith MyRecover, users can retrieve all kinds of lost data, including those lost through the Recycle Bin, deleted files, files lost in formatting, lost in system crashes, and virus attacks.\nThere are two modes available - a quick scan and a deep scan, depending on the amount of data lost, and the method through which it was deleted.\nYou can recover lost data from almost all Windows storage media, such as HDD, SSD, external hard drive, USB drive, digital camera, SD card, and similar.\nFor Windows, there\u2019s support for NTFS, FAT32, exFAT, ReFS in Windows 11/10/8/7 and Windows Server, while for iOS there\u2019s support for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch with iOS 10 and later, including iOS 17.\nOn both platforms, you can recover various data including images, videos, emails, photos, contacts, call history, and many more.\nApart from a free option, MyRecover also has paid plans, aimed at those that want more advanced features.\nWindows users get to choose between the Pro and Technician plans. The former is more suited for individual users or home offices, and it\u2019s priced at $59.95 yearly or $99.95 for a lifetime (one-time) purchase. The Technician plan is made with enterprises in mind and is priced at $199 yearly or $399 for a lifetime purchase.\nFor iOS users the plan is priced at $29.95 yearly or $69.95 for a lifetime purchase.\nFAQs\nWhat is the best data recovery software?\nWhen deciding which data recovery software to download and use, first try to determine how difficult the data might be to recover. For example, some dual-disk RAID configurations mean that recovery isn't going to be a simple process. Additionally, free or budget software options may have built-in limitations on how much data or how many files you can actually recover.\nThe golden rule of data recovery is never to install the data recovery program onto the same drive from which you want to recover data. The reason for this is that your system will see the space occupied by deleted files as available for new data, which means they could be overwritten.\nIf your utility supports it, you should also consider creating a disk image of the drive which contains your missing data. This allows you to recover your files safely without risking overwriting the missing data on the original disk. Creating a disk image also means you can make it available for download to professional data recovery services.\nIf you do decide to go it alone, make sure to download the free version of your chosen data recovery utility first. You can usually 'preview' recovered files within the program, so you can decide if it's worth paying for a monthly or annual subscription.\nHow does data recovery software work?\nWhen it comes to a hard drive or other storage medium, data that is stored on the drive isn't physically removed from the drive. It still exists, and the delete button simply marks the space that the file is occupying as available.\nThat means that if you act fast enough, you can recover files that are deleted before the space is overwritten with new data. If, however, you have already heavily modified the drive then the chances of retrieving lost data are slim.\nThe same can be said for damaged drives. The data is still stored on the drive but your computer may not be picking up its connection due to a broken connection or faulty driver.\nOnce the data you are trying to recover has been identified, the software will mark the occupied space on the drive as 'taken', rather than free. Viola, your data will (hopefully) have been recovered.\nHow do I use data recovery software?\nFirst, find your data recovery software of choice and install it. Our top recommended pick is the EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard.\nNow, use the data recovery software to find the drive you would like to recover the files from. This can be a built in drive on your Windows, Mac, phone, external storage, or other storage type such as NAS.\nClick the 'Scan' or button to launch a scan of the drive to see if there are any files that can be retrieved. These scans can take time, especially if the drive has a lot of data on it or it has been formatted.\nOnce the scan is complete, you will be able to 'Preview' the files that can be recovered from the drive. This allows you to select the files you are looking for, and specifically recover them. Alternatively, you will be able to choose to recover all of the identified files.\nClick 'Recover' and the files will be restored to their original location. Just be aware that if you have waited a while or modified the afflicted drive after losing the files, some of them may become corrupted or unrecoverable.\nHow we test\nHow we tested the best data recovery software\nTo test for the best data recovery software we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for recovering data using a virtual machine running Windows 11, to which we attached three different drives. This allowed us to benchmark various data loss scenarios, such as trying to recover files from a corrupted drive.\nThe files we chose for recovery are an album of Mozart's Music available from the Internet Archive. We did this as we wanted to see how the utility performed with a wide variety of files, including both common and more obscure formats.\nThe aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nWe do not believe that running data recovery tools in a virtual environment has a significant effect on how they function. Still, if you're considering buying software we encourage you to read all reviews thoroughly and make sure that the developer offers a refund policy.\nWe've also featured the best document editing and management software.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "At Hot Chips 2025, Microsoft went into its Azure Hardware Security. The goal is to keep Azure secure since it is a giant cloud service. Microsoft does not just have to protect against external traffic threats, instead it has multi-tenant workloads to keep safe, and some customers want to ensure they are secure from even Azure itself.\nPlease note, we are covering this live, so please excuse typos.\nMicrosoft Azure Hardware Security to Help Thwart the World\u2019s 3rd Largest GDP\nHaving a Hot Chips article with a cheekier title is not something we normally do, but we saw this slide. In terms of world economies, cybercrime now ranks between Germany and China in GDP according to Microsoft\u2019s chart at just over $9T in 2024, and expected to be over $10T in 2025.\nMicrosoft had a bunch of great stats. They have 70+ Azure regions, 400+ data centers, 275K miles of fiber, 190+ network POPs, and 34,000 dedicated security engineers.\nAs a result, their systems are designed for security as part of the company\u2019s Secure Future Initiative (SFI.)\nMicrosoft is also going into its system architecture. Of note, this looks like a newer retention clip Intel thermal solution with each CPU having 12 DIMM slots. Those 12 DIMM slots are either 6-channel 2DPC or they defy industry convention and use different color locking tabs for alternating channels instead of indicating the first or second DIMM in a channel.\nPart of this architecture is also the hardware security modules. These can come as PCIe cards or in server and rack mount solutions.\nIn typcial hardware security designs, there is a central HSM cluster.\nMicrosoft is moving its hardware security from the centralized model to being integrated into each server.\nThis is the Azure Integrated HSM which is Microsoft\u2019s security chip. By having a local ASIC, there does not need to be a TLS handshake to a centralized server.\nHaving an in-house chip means that it needs to make the trade-offs in chip design. Previously, when this was centralized, Microsoft would scale the HSM at a cluster level. Now, it needs to size it for a single server, but also keeping it low power and in a small area.\nMicrosoft needs not just AES and PKE crypto acceleration, but also the ability to detect things like intrusion and tampering.\nMicrosoft also went into its confidential computing.\nThe idea is to protect data in use especially in multi-tenant cloud environments.\nMicrosoft is now talking about its Caliptra 2.0 open source silicon root of trust.\nThis is cool. Microsoft is going into the gate count for different features. This is perhaps the most Hot Chips slide we have seen this year.\nHere are the verification release gates.\nSince this is a custom ASIC for Microsoft, the question might be why open source it? Here are Microsoft\u2019s reasons:\nOverall, this is pretty neat.\nFinal Words\nThis was a neat look not just at what Microsoft is doing, but also a but about the \u201cwhy?\u201d and Microsoft\u2019s philosophy around securing its cloud. Microsoft is more open about this than some other cloud providers, so it is a neat look. If nothing else, learning that the cybercrime market is bigger than the AI market at over $10T and that Microsoft has 34,000 dedicated security folks was neat.\nI\u2019m a bit curious what they are up to with the HSM placement.\nIf you want more than a TPM will give you for platform-locked identification and encryption purposes an HSM seems like a potentially reasonable choice; but for much of what you would choose HSMs for the fact that they live behind a network abstraction, and can be scaled separately from number of hosts, is a virtue: you want your VMs and containers to be able to move around as needed while still having whatever level of cert access they are supposed to have; and (especially with HSMs doing more of the cryptographic heavy lifting) the relationship between number of certs or number of cryptographic operations per unit time and number of cores or RAM size can vary all over the place, which seems like it would make node-itegrated HSMs vulnerable to being over or undersized.\nI don\u2019t doubt that they have their reasons; but I\u2019d like to know more about how that one works.\nWhile no one knows an actual number \u2013 10T$/yr in cyber crime is an absolute BS.\nWho came up with this nonsense?\nI\u2019m guessing that the host based HSM solution works into some kind of loose clustering, allowing for VM relocation without completely breaking the encryption.\nAdmittedly, this seems to defeat a lot of the purpose of an HSM, but I can\u2019t see how you could actually maintain uptime if a VM was tied to a single physical host for it\u2019s entire lifecycle."

      "text": "The true cost of cyber attacks\nOver half of UK businesses have experienced a cyber attack\nSo far this year, M&S, Co-op, Cartier, Harrods and most recently, LVMH, have become victims of cyber attacks. While these events involving big name brands have captured headlines, they\u2019re not the only ones.\nNew research has revealed that over half of UK businesses have experienced a cyber attack in the past three years alone, proving no organization is beyond the reach of cybercriminals. More startlingly, they\u2019ve suffered a staggering \u00a364bn loss in direct and indirect costs as a result.\nAs the cyber landscape continues to evolve, AI continues to democratize attacks, cyber groups become more entrepreneurial, and attacks from hostile nation states escalate, that figure is only set to rise.\nReports suggest M&S singlehandedly suffered a \u00a3300m profit loss due to the attack on its systems carried out by ScatteredSpider. This must serve as a warning to others. Businesses of all types must act to minimize the devastating impact attacks can have on business growth. Because it doesn\u2019t matter how big or well-known you are. Everyone is at risk.\nShifting from a reactive to proactive cybersecurity strategy can help organizations stay ahead of evolving threats. The investment can mitigate the need to pay out potentially huge sums of money in the wake of the attack, and what\u2019s more, there\u2019s proof it has a positive impact on turnover.\nGlobal Cybersecurity Advisor for ESET.\nUnder preparation increases cyber costs\nThe rise of AI, increased exposure to international threats and the emergence of Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) are making the cyber landscape more challenging than ever.\nThe growing threat of attack methods like ransomware, phishing and supply chain attacks continue to impact businesses of all sizes. Despite this, businesses are often reluctant to implement advanced security measures due to initial high costs involved.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nWhile these costs do initially appear steep for businesses with stretched budgets and other pressing priorities, they pale in comparison to the potential fallout of a cyber attack. The average cost of an attack can reach \u00a3721,000 for small to mid-size enterprises (SMEs) and run into the millions for large businesses. For SMEs in particular, this cost can be crippling.\nDespite these potentially devastating costs, nearly half of UK businesses still admit to managing cybersecurity fully in-house. But faced with evolving and highly sophisticated threats, a fully in-house approach lacks the external expertise that is vital for keeping pace with cybercriminals.\nResiliency is a cyber must-have\nAnother major financial challenge for businesses is soaring cyber insurance premiums. But, it has to be said that they are a necessary investment in today\u2019s threat landscape. In fact, the Cyber Security and Resilience Bill, due to be implemented in the second half of 2025, will require businesses to demonstrate cyber resilience, of which comprehensive cyber insurance is a crucial component. With the new bill coming into effect imminently, businesses must prioritize attaining proper insurance sooner rather than later.\nAnd yes, premiums can be high. But having the right cyber protection in place can help to drastically reduce them. In fact, personal experience has shown that implementing measures like an extended detection and response (XDR) platform, multi-factor authentication and vulnerability scanning, can lead to a reduction in insurances premiums of up to 75%.\nCybersecurity as a revenue driver\nMore UK businesses are considering cybersecurity a strategic priority, with 77% planning to increase their cyber budget over the next year, and for good reason. On average, UK businesses generate an estimated \u00a327bn in additional revenue annually from investing in cybersecurity.\nWhile well-established and widely known brands can rectify the reputational damage breaches can cause, for smaller or less well-known companies, a negative reputation could be devastating. You cannot put a price on reputation.\nSo, by implementing measures like expert-managed solutions and robust threat detection, businesses can not only reduce their own cyber risk, but prove strong cyber credentials. As customers become increasingly cyber aware, this can now we a deciding factor in winning new business over competitors.\nWhat\u2019s more, outsourcing cybersecurity is cited by 68% of businesses to improve information technology (IT) systems in efficiency, increased performance and reduced IT downtime. Nearly half of respondents also said robust cyber security infrastructure had enabled them to take on more risk such as entering new markets or adopting emerging technologies.\nPreviously only viewed as a protection measure, businesses are gradually adopting the mindset of strong cybersecurity ultimately boosting streams of revenue and internal efficiencies, providing benefits beyond \u2018simple\u2019 security.\nAs cyber threats evolve, cybersecurity must as well\nReactionary cybersecurity can cost more than 10 times as much when recovering from an attack as businesses would spend on proactive measures.\nBy implementing cybersecurity, businesses can maximize efficiency, enhance customer trust and position themselves for sustained competitive advantage in an increasingly digital economy.\nEarly investment carries immense financial and operational benefits, but businesses must be well supported and educated on the necessary cyber measures to suit their specific business needs.\nCybersecurity is evolving as the threat landscape continues to be a growing concern. For some businesses, adopting cyber measures to protect against perceived threats is not enough and only by shifting mindset to see security as a revenue driver will UK businesses fully adopt the necessary measures.\nWe've featured the best endpoint protection software.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Keys remain isolated from software, including guest and host systems, ensuring strong physical and logical tamper protection. Unlike traditional HSMs, which introduce network latency or require key release to local environments, Azure Integrated HSM securely retains keys within the module for continuous in-use protection.\nComing to all new Microsoft data center servers\n\"As part of our systems approach in optimizing every layer in our infrastructure, security is a key priority, and we are designing our infrastructure hardware with multiple layers of defense with dedicated innovations to ensure robust protection for Microsoft and for our customers,\" noted Mark Russinovich, Microsoft\u2019s CTO for Azure.\nThe module is designed to integrate seamlessly with both confidential and general-purpose virtual machines and containers, providing dedicated, secure partitions for each workload. These partitions are hardware-isolated, allowing workloads to access keys only through controlled oracle functions. This design boosts security and reduces latency with node-integrated connections and cryptographic hardware accelerators.\nAzure Integrated HSM will be installed in all new servers across Microsoft data centers starting next year, bolstering protection across Azure\u2019s hardware fleet. This deployment is part of the Secure Future Initiative, which also includes Adams Bridge quantum-resilient accelerator and Caliptra 2.0 silicon root of trust.\n\u201cBy integrating advanced hardware security features such as the silicon root of trust and secure control modules, we are providing the foundation for the trust and security that Azure delivers to our customers,\u201d Russinovich said. \u201cWe are committed to continuously enhancing our cloud hardware security capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\u201d\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nYou might also like\nWayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

      "text": "Windows 11 Pro vs Windows 11 Home: which version is right for you?\nNo two Windows versions are the same - here are some of the biggest differences\nAre you considering upgrading your computer to Windows 11? Are you buying a new computer and need to know which operating system is right for you? Regardless of the reason, you should be aware Windows 11 has two main versions: Windows 11 Pro and Windows 11 Home.\nWhile Windows 11\u2019s sleek new interface and core functionalities are the same on both versions, there are still some differences.\nThis article compares Windows 11 Pro and Windows 11 Home to determine their strengths and weaknesses, assisting you in deciding which edition is most suitable for you.\nWindows 11 Pro vs Windows 11 Home: features\nWindows 11 Pro has many features that are not available in the Home edition, so it should come as no surprise that it\u2019s more suitable for professionals and businesses. Some of the features of Windows 11 Pro include BitLocker encryption, which ensures that your data is well protected if your device is lost or stolen. Furthermore, Pro has WIP (Windows Information Protection), which helps to protect company data and avoid accidental leaks.\nThe Pro version of Windows 11 also comes with essential management tools, like Group Policy, which help centrally manage different network devices. The Remote Desktop feature enables you to work from your computer to another device, making it more flexible. Pro also supports Hyper-V, which means that users can create virtual machines, a feature that will be useful for developers and IT administrators.\nAlthough both versions have basic features like Windows Hello and Microsoft Defender, Windows 11 Pro has more useful features for power users.\nWindows 11 Pro vs Windows 11 Home: performance\nThere are good reasons why Windows 11 Pro is more powerful than Windows 11 Home when you look at what\u2019s happening behind the scenes. This starts with the hardware limitations on the latter. Windows 11 Home has restrictions on how much RAM and CPU cores it can use. The Home version has a limit of 128GB of RAM and 64 CPU cores, while Pro has a limit of 2TB of RAM and 128 CPU cores (across two processors). This isn\u2019t a concern for many people because only enterprise-level servers approach these limits, and most users won\u2019t see a difference. However, for professionals using numerous VMs and heavy-duty applications, Pro offers more flexibility that could provide a slight performance boost.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nThe Pro edition frequently has additional features operating in the background, features like networking, security, and management. These features are typically optimized to run in the background and are unlikely to use system resources more heavily than Home. You aren\u2019t likely to notice a difference in performance for typical users.\nCertain Pro-exclusive features, including Hyper-V for virtualization, will generally affect system performance. Virtual machines are standard and use system resources without indicating the operating system\u2019s overall performance. For typical tasks, gaming, and general use, most users will not notice a difference in performance between Windows 11 Home and Pro. Both versions are built on the same platform and are optimized for current hardware. The main distinctions exist in features and capabilities rather than raw power.\nWindows 11 Pro vs Windows 11 Home: support\nBoth Pro and Home users of Windows 11 can contact Microsoft through standard support channels:\nOnline support: Microsoft\u2019s website has a vast collection of support resources, including help center articles, how-to guides, and community forums where users can provide answers to common questions and solutions. Phone support: You can contact Microsoft\u2019s support team by phone for technical concerns. The wait time will vary depending on the number of incoming calls.\nIn-app help: Windows 11 has integrated help features that offer context-based information while using the operating system.\nHowever, there are some differences in the support experience for Home and Pro users:\nBusiness support: Pro users, particularly those in business, may be able to contact dedicated support or have service level agreements (SLAs) that provide quicker support with more complex issues. These agreements are typically part of a contract or an enterprise license.\nAdvanced troubleshooting: The support agents may be more familiar with the additional features and troubleshooting scenarios unique to the Pro edition of the operating system, including those related to networking, security, and virtualization.\nMicrosoft offers general essential support to both home and pro users. However, pro users can access more specific and rapid support, especially for businesses.\nWindows 11 Pro vs Windows 11 Home: pricing\nWindows 11 Home is the more affordable option for individual users and families, while Windows 11 Pro is pricier due to its features designed for professionals and businesses. If you build your own PC, Home is usually less expensive than Pro. Many consumer computers come with Home pre-installed, whereas Pro is often found in business devices.\nYou can upgrade from Windows 11 Home to Pro for a fee, and it\u2019s worth checking for sales and promotions from retailers. Be aware of pricing differences between OEM versions, which are tied to specific hardware, and retail versions, which can be installed on any compatible PC.\nUltimately, the price difference reflects the additional features in Pro, so assess your needs against your budget to determine the best value.\nWindows 11 Pro vs Windows 11 Home: verdict\nIn conclusion, Windows 11 Home is tailored for the typical home user, providing all the essential features needed for everyday tasks such as web browsing, video streaming, and basic productivity. It is an excellent choice for individuals and families who primarily use their computers for personal activities.\nIn contrast, Windows 11 Pro is designed for more advanced users and professionals. It includes all the features of the Home edition along with additional tools for enhanced security, device management, and improved connectivity. This makes it an ideal option for businesses, IT professionals, and those who neeIn conclusion, Windows 11 Home is designed for the average home user, offering all the essential features needed for everyday tasks such as web browsing, video streaming, and basic productivity.
