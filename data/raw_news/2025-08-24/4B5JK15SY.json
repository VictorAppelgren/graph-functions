  "description": "Douglas Tires are a budget brand typically sold by Walmart, but are they tires any good? Here's what some reviews say about the brand and its product.",
  "content": "Are Douglas Tires From Walmart Any Good? Here's What Users Say\n\nPriced between $50 and $120 per tire, Douglas Tires are among the most affordable retail options available. Douglas Tires are owned by the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, are made in the U.S., and cost nearly half as much as their premium Goodyear siblings. This raises the question of whether Douglas tires from Walmart are any good. Here's what users have to say. In general, the reactions are mixed, yet many people praise Douglas tires for being consistent and able to offer a safe driving experience for up to 60k miles. They also state that for general commuter cars, Douglas tires are fine as long as you don't push the car. On the other hand, some people were less convinced, saying that Douglas tires are flimsy, prone to belt separations, rapid tread wear, and are generally less durable compared to more premium offerings. All in all, Douglas Tires are a solid choice for those on a tight budget and those who are looking for a regular city-friendly commuter tire. They're designed to provide a more practical, cost-effective solution rather than superior performance, and for that application, they are sufficient.\n\nWhat's the difference between premium and budget tires? The question of whether it is worth spending extra money on expensive tires as opposed to budget-friendly brands like Douglas is rooted firmly in the balance of value versus performance. Brands such as Michelin, Goodyear, Continental, and Pirelli are all widely regarded as staple premium tire brands. This means that the value versus performance ratio with these is in favor of performance. Premium tire brands use higher-quality tread compounds, which are intended to make the vehicle more reactive to the driver's input, especially during hard braking and acceleration. Engineering Explained reached the same conclusion in testing, finding that premium tires stopped 36 feet shorter than a comparable cheap tire. This gave the driver about an extra life-saving second to react compared to budget options. Moreover, it also translates to nearly one-third of a G difference in measurable handling performance. Premium tires last longer, are quieter, and are often more fuel efficient. For those looking for the very best performing tires on the market, premium tires are always the better choice because premium tire brands go the extra mile to make their tires as best as they can be. Budget brands on the other hand, try to make their tires as affordable as they can be while still performing adequately.\n\nHow long do Douglas Tires last? In some instances, Douglas Tires start deteriorating after just three years of use, and there are numerous reviews across the internet of people complaining about lackluster tread life and accelerated tread wear. On the other hand, some people deem Douglas Tires perfectly adequate for the price, with reports that they will last 40k or even 60k miles. It's worth noting that these come with a warranty for up to 50k miles, which is in line with some premium tires. Be that as it may, tire longevity isn't only tied to the tire compound itself, as there are many ways you can make your tires last longer. This means that if you aren't maintaining your tires and not using them for what they were designed to do, chances are that they will not be able to last as long as they otherwise would. For a spot of context, a proper wheel alignment can extend the lifespan of your tires for up to 30 percent while regular tire rotations can push their lifespan for up to 20 percent.",

      "text": "Who Owns Douglas Tires? (And How To Tell Where They're Made)\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nIf you're currently in the market for a new set of tires, your head may well be spinning at the sheer number of options available to you. But if you're angling to get some fresh rubber on your vehicle on a budget, you've likely already perused the options available from big box retailer Walmart. Assuming that's the case, you've no doubt considered making your next set of tires Douglas tires.\nWith the average cost of tires fluctuating with some regularity, you've likely got a checklist of questions you want to run down before you fork over the requisite cash required to put them on your car. Among those questions might be what actual users think of Douglas Tires. If so, you'll be happy to know that, for the most part, the tires are well-reviewed by consumers, with many holding a 4.5 stars out of 5 rating on Walmart's website. As for the negative reviews, many focus on issues that stemmed from ordering the tires online.\nA little further down your checklist might be who actually owns Douglas Tires. Common sense might lead you to believe that Walmart is behind the tire outfit, but that is not the case. Douglas an independent outfit, either. In fact, the manufacturer listed on Walmart's product pages is Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. That would seem to signal Douglas is indeed owned by the American tire maker, making it one of several brands exclusively offered through Walmart.\nA tire's ID number can tell you its manufacturing location\nNow that we know who owns and makes Douglas Tires, your next question might be where the tires were made. However, when it comes to an outfit the size of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, that can be a slightly daunting task. As of this writing, Goodyear boasts 55 different production facilities that are spread across 22 countries throughout the world, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nDaunting as the task may seem, there is an easy way to figure out where your Douglas tires were made, or any other tire you might be interested in, for that matter. That's because every tire now comes stamped with an 8 to 13-character Tire Identification Number (or TIN for short). Once you have the tire's TIN at your disposal, you can visit any number of online tracking sites, plug it in, and figure out not only the exact production plant but where in the world that plant is located.\nThe TIN is easy to find and typically located on the tire's outer side wall. As the Department of Transportation is tracking a tire's place of origin, the TIN begins with the letters DOT, followed by a two-letter designation that operates as a factory code, as well as a series of letter and number combinations detailing other pertinent information, including even the year the tire was made."

      "text": "Is It Worth Spending Extra Money For Expensive Tires Versus Buying Cheap Ones?\nIf you've been a car owner for a while, you probably understand that vehicles require a lot of routine maintenance. Those maintenance projects include everything from engine oil replacements to brake changes and drive belt replacements. Most of that work is relatively affordable. However, not all maintenance is cheap. Things like tire replacements are among the most expensive maintenance jobs that you need to perform, with the average cost of new tires ranging from $80 to $250 or more a piece.\nFortunately, new tires should last for an average of three to five years before you need to replace them. That means that tires aren't something you should have to worry about every few months, like oil replacements. However, it's still a large expenditure, and you may be curious about some ways you can cut down on those costs. One method that many people may be tempted to use is opting for cheaper tires in place of more expensive brands.\nCheap tires can be a decent way to save some cash, but they can come with their downsides. For example, cheaper tires may be built with lower-quality materials and may provide a shorter lifespan than those that come with a more expensive price tag. In the long run, that can result in buying tires more frequently, which isn't a great way to save money. If you're interested in learning more about the differences between cheap and expensive tires, stick around. As a former professional auto mechanic who has replaced thousands of tires, I'll break it down for you. Here's everything you need to know about cheap versus expensive tires and whether buying less expensive rubber is worth it.\nWhat are the differences between cheap and expensive tires?\nWhile basically every automotive tire is designed to perform the same essential duties, they're not all created equal. Not only are different tires built for different types of vehicles and driving scenarios, but they can also be constructed with varying degrees of quality and expected mileage ratings. When it comes to differences between the cheapest and most expensive tires, the above-mentioned factors play a significant role.\nCheaper tires may be built with outdated technology or lower-quality materials, and they may offer a substantially shorter lifespan than those that cost a bit more money. However, it's also important to note that some of the most expensive tires are engineered for niche driving activities, like drag racing or off-road terrain. In these cases, buying the most expensive option probably won't make sense, and some high-performance tires can even offer fewer benefits for everyday driving than some of the cheaper options available.\nAccording to most experts, the best course of action is to opt for a reputable mid-range tire. More expensive brands, like Michelin, Continental, Goodyear, and BFGoodrich, are all considered to be some of the best options on the market. However, some of these brands, like Michelin and Goodyear, maintain cheaper subsidiaries, which offer similar quality at lower price points. Mid-range brands, like Cooper (a subsidiary of Goodyear), Riken (a subsidiary of Michelin), and Falken offer cheaper prices than some of the most expensive names on the market while still coming in at a higher price-point than the cheapest brands. Instead of focusing purely on price, it's important to read reviews, investigate a tire's application, mileage rating, and materials, as well as consider the weather in your area and the type of driving you plan to do.\nHow to know which tires are right for you and your car\nWhen it's time to buy new tires for your car, you may be confused by all of the options, as well as the complex numbers that identify different tire sizes. Fortunately, picking tires for your vehicle isn't as complicated as it may seem. When you visit a tire shop or dealership, the expert employees will be able to help you choose the right tires for your vehicle. However, remember that not everyone who works in these shops holds themselves to the same ethical standards. So, it's still wise to do a bit of your own research.\nOne of the best ways to determine the correct tires for your car is to check your vehicle owner's manual. You can usually find these manuals inside your car's glove compartment, and they contain valuable information like fluid types and capacities, service intervals, and information about your vehicle's tires. You can also check the placard inside the driver-side door jamb of your car. There, you'll find information about tire psi and size.\nBesides knowing the proper tire size, you'll also want to select the proper type of tire. This is where it becomes a bit more confusing, as different tires are engineered for different things. Most people need solid all-season tires, which are designed to handle most normal weather types and climates. However, if you do a lot of off-road driving, or if you live somewhere with harsh winters, you may need specialized rubber. Consulting with the salespeople at the shop is a good way to learn the differences between different tire types. However, remember to pick a reputable shop to avoid scams, and don't forget to do a bit of your own research first to protect your wallet.\nAre cheap tires ever worth it?\nNow that you understand the primary differences between cheap and expensive tires, you may be wondering if a cheap set of rubber is ever worth it. While most experts agree that you should opt for a mid-range tire instead of going with the cheapest or the most expensive option available, there are scenarios in which you may want to buy a cheaper product.\nOne of the main reasons some people install cheaper tires is that they're planning to sell the car and don't want to invest in a fresh set of quality rubber. While putting cheap tires on a vehicle you plan to sell may not be the most ethical decision, it can be a quick and easy way to spruce up the car's appearance. Next, if you live somewhere that experiences relatively mild weather and very little rain, buying a cheaper tire may not be the worst decision, depending on your driving habits, that is. If you only commute very short distances on well-paved roads with low speed limits, a cheaper tire may get the job done.\nHowever, if you do lots of highway driving, you should opt for a quality tire brand, even if you live somewhere with impeccable weather. Finally, buying a cheap tire may be the only option available to you. If your current tires are extremely bald or damaged, a cheap tire with new tread may be better than continuing to drive on unsafe bald tires. That said, buying extremely cheap tires is almost never a smart move. For one, they'll most likely wear out much quicker than a more expensive brand. And, more importantly, they probably won't provide the same level of traction and stability that a pricier product can offer, which can lead to unsafe driving conditions."

      "text": "5 Ways To Make Your Tires Last Longer\nEvery car part is important, but your tires are particularly so because of their safety implications. In the rain or in the snow, tires in good working condition ensure you don't slide off the road. And when you need to brake suddenly, your tires play a huge part in how quickly you come to a stop.\nReplacing car parts when they go bad can be pretty expensive. While you should never compromise on your safety or that of other drivers, there are ways to maintain your car tires so that they last longer and you don't have to worry as much about shelling out cash for expensive replacements.\nGood tires, if well-maintained, can last you about four years, according to Dan Zielinski of the U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association (via Car and Driver). The number could be higher or lower, depending on how and where you drive and the quality of your tires. Ideally, though, tires shouldn't be a car part that you replace yearly. So, let's get into all the things you should be doing to take care of your tires so they serve you for a long time.\nUse the right tires and drive carefully\nIt's always important to use the right tires and drive with care. You might be indulging in terrible driving habits that are slashing your tires' lifecycle and affecting your car's overall performance.\nIf you're rough in your handling, steering, and stopping, occasionally hitting the curb at high speed, running into bumps and potholes, or driving on the shoulder or rocky terrain with the wrong tires, you'll start to see signs you need to replace your tires with new ones pretty soon. With that in mind, be cautious when accelerating or braking. Watch out for potholes and ditches and avoid them if you can. When parking, do so carefully and avoid hitting the curb, which can damage your tires' sidewalls.\nAnother thing you should pay attention to is the type of tires fitted to your car. If it's a set of all-season or all-terrain tires, then you have a lot more leeway. However, if you have summer tires or winter tires, using either set in the wrong season can cause them to deteriorate quickly.\nCheck your pressure every month\nThe more often you drive, the more likely it is for your tire pressure to reduce over time. The wrong amount of pressure in either direction can mess with the tire's structure, and having too much or too little can also affect your car's performance.\nIf your tires don't have enough air pressure, you'll consume more fuel. If there's too much pressure, your car may struggle to brake, accelerate, or turn efficiently. That can easily lead to a blowout, or worse, a serious accident.\nHow often should you be checking your car tire's pressure? You don't have to wait until one of your tires is flat or there's a warning light on your dashboard to start paying attention. It's generally recommended that you check your tire pressure at least once every month and before embarking on a long road trip. That way, you can rest easy knowing that one important safety concern is taken care of.\nCheck alignment and keep your wheels balanced\nWithout proper alignment, your tires may wear out faster than they should. Usually, this will occur unevenly because your tires have an unusual tilt or wiggle to them, so the tread could be smooth on one side and rough on another.\nThis also involves the steering and suspension. Bad alignment often means that the suspension parts, like the tie rod, have an issue. This could be the result of hitting the curb too many times or driving on bad, uneven roads. It's important to watch for signs that your wheels need an alignment.\nAdditionally, when your wheels aren't properly balanced, there's an uneven distribution of weight, which can further affect your suspension and tires. When you visit an auto shop, they might offer you balancing and alignment services in one package. This addresses two different areas of your car and plays a significant role in keeping your wheels, suspension, and tires in good condition.\nRotate your tires\nMost tire manufacturers recommend rotating your tires every 5,000 to 8,000 miles or so. This involves swapping your tires so that the ones at the front go to the back, the ones on the left go to the right, or both. A professional mechanic can help you figure out the pattern that makes the most sense for the type of car you drive.\nRotating your tires every six months (or whenever you go in for an oil change) will help even out the wear on your tires and make them last longer. But you should consult your owner's manual to be sure what frequency your particular car manufacturer prescribes.\nIf you don't rotate your tires regularly, it not only affects your tires but your car's performance as well. You might start to experience drifting and some other major problems with the handling, so this is a part of your car's maintenance you shouldn't neglect.\nPark where there's shade\nNHTSA research shows that tires age more quickly in warmer temperatures. Constant exposure to sunlight affects your tires more than you might think, so be mindful about where you park. A garage is perfect, but if you don't have one, try parking where there's some shade. You can also create your own shade by using a car cover or getting dedicated tire covers.\nIt's also important to keep your tires clean. When washing your car, don't neglect them. This helps to keep them in good condition. Another thing to remember is that even the most careful drivers still get flat tires. When you do, try to get it repaired properly. Not fixing it correctly degrades your tires and could result in a blowout. If the tire is damaged beyond proper repair, have it replaced.\nIt's important to make sure that your car and all of its parts are in good condition. That way, your car's performance stays optimal, and you and other drivers remain safe."
