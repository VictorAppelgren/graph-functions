  "content": "> > IT IS 5:00 A.M. IN NEW YORK CITY. AND I AM VONNIE QUINN WITH YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. LEGAL HEADACHES ABOUND. PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKS THE SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD HIS GLOBAL TARIFFS. THE AI RACE IS HEATING UP WITH APPLE PLANNING A WEB SEARCH TOOL AND DEEPSEEK BUILDS AN AI AGENT. INVESTORS AWAIT MORE JOBS DATA AFTER A COOLER THAN EXPECTED JOLTS. A LITTLE CALMER TODAY WITH FUTURES ACTUALLY POINTED HIGHER, PERHAPS THANKS TO THE BOND MARKETS. WE DID GET SOME EARNINGS AFTER THE BELL. IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT WE ARE LITTLE DISAPPOINTED FOR SOME OF THE TECH COMPANIES, LOOKING AT YOU, SALESFORCE. WITHIN .003 OF 5% YESTERDAY, QUITE THE MOVE WITHIN U.S. BONDS. WE HAD A SERIES OF FRENCH BONDS, MIXED WITH NOT SO BAD. COMMODITIES-WISE, LOOKING AT A DAY OF LOSSES FOR GOLD. THAT IS THE FIRST IN EIGHT DAYS. SEVEN DAYS OF GAINS AND WE ARE JUST OFF OF THOSE HIRES. WE ARE STILL ABOVE 3500 PER OUNCE. GOLDMAN SACHS SAYING THAT WE COULD GET TO 5000 IF CERTAIN THINGS, INCLUDING THE FED, DON'T GO WELL -- INCLUDING FED INDEPENDENCE, IN PARTICULAR. WAITING ON THE OPEC-PLUS MEETING, THE U.S. DOLLAR INDEX RELATIVELY UNCHANGED. SOME OF THE DUAL STOCKS WE WILL WATCH TODAY. LET'S GET TO LONDON WITH VALERIE TYTEL. VALERIE: I WANTED TO START WITH SALESFORCE. SALESFORCE IS MOVING LOWER IN THE PREMARKET. SALESFORCE IS DOWN 6.8% OFF OF THE BACK OF FORECASTING SOME PRETTY WEAK GUIDANCE. IT SEEMS LIKE THEIR INVESTMENT IN AI INFRASTRUCTURE, AI TOOLS, ISN'T PAYING OFF AS QUICKLY AS EXPECTED AND INVESTORS ARE GETTING WORRIED THE INCUMBENT SOFTWARE MAKERS MAY BE BEATEN TO THE PUNCH BY NEW AI VENDORS. THE NEXT STOCK, HP. THEY ARE OUT WITH THE RESULTS AFTER THE BELL LAST NIGHT. THIS IS A MIXED PICTURE. THEY GAVE SOME GUIDANCE THAT THEIR MARGINS ARE GOING TO COME UNDER PRESSURE. THE CEO EXPECTS THEM TO BE BOOSTED BY THE END OF THE YEAR. INVESTORS ARE SEEING A FREE CASH FLOW, A BOOST TO FREE CASH FLOW IN 2026. WE ARE TRADING HIGHER ON HP UP 3%. LASTLY, AMERICAN EAGLETON, AND OTHER TO REPORT. THE SIDNEY SWEENEY AD WAS MORE THAN SUCCESSFUL. AMERICAN THE EAGLES FLYING OFF THE SHELVES AND THE SIDNEY SWEENEY JEANS. THE CEO SAYS THEY GAINED A CUSTOMER IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTY IN THE U.S. IN THE PREVIOUS QUARTER. VONNIE: WE WILL CATCH UP ON MARKET RISKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND STEPHANIE GUILD FROM ROBINHOOD LATER THIS HOUR ON OPPORTUNITIES IN STOCKS. THE FED GOVERNOR AND POTENTIAL FED CHAIR CANADA CHRIS WALLER ONCE AGAIN ADVOCATING FOR RATE CUTS TO BEGIN THIS MONTH AND MORE REDUCTIONS IN THE COMING MONTHS. \"THE LABOR MARKET IS THE KEY TO THE PROPAGATION OF PRICE PRESSURES. THUS WE LIKE 5-10 YEAR TREASURIES WITH NO EXPOSURE BEYOND THE 10 YEAR.\" JAMES, WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THE LONG END, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN READING THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS OF MOVES? JAMES: IT HAS BEEN INTERESTING. WE HAVE SEEN A COORDINATED, COINCIDENTAL SELLOFF IN LONG ENDS ACROSS THE GLOBE, REALLY. THERE ARE LOTS OF SUBTLE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THESE MARKETS, BUT I GUESS FISCAL POLICY IS REALLY THE ONE CHALLENGE THAT ALL ECONOMIES HAVE. THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REASONS WHY 30 YEARS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING FOR SOME TIME IN ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE HAVE BEEN AVOIDING THAT AREA. VONNIE: IT IS INTERESTING. YOU WERE LOOKING AT THEM IN JAPAN. I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE JAPANESE MOVE. IS IT OVER NOW THAT IT IS ABATING?NOT AS MUCH AS IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT STILL ABATING? JAMES: JAPAN HAS BEEN THE POSTER CHILD FOR FISCAL INCOMPETENCE AND DEBT BALANCES. SINCE THE PANDEMIC THEY HAVE STARTED TO IMPROVE THE DEBT TO GDP TRAJECTORY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT DEBT ON A NET BASIS IN JAPAN, IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AS WORRYING, 160 PERCENT OF GDP AREA -- NOT GREAT, BUT NOT AS BAD AS THE GROSS INDEX NUMBERS LOOK. ULTIMATELY JAPANESE DOMESTIC SAVINGS ARE STILL HUGE, IT IS STILL A DOMESTICALLY-DRIVEN MARKET, AND LARGE INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN CHASED OFFSHORE IN THE LAST 10 TO 15 YEARS ARE STARTING TO SEE, AND WE THINK WILL CONTINUE TO SEE COME INCENTIVES TO INVEST DOMESTICALLY INCREASING AND PROBABLY INCREASING DRAMATICALLY. IT HAS BEEN A BIT PAINFUL FOR US IN THE SHORT-TERM, BUT THE SUPPOSITION THAT WE THINK HAS STRUCTURAL POSITIVE OUTLOOKS. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HOLD ON UNLESS SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. VONNIE: YOU AGREE WITH CHRIS WALLER THAT SEVERAL RATE CUTS ARE NECESSARY OVER THE COMING MONTHS. DO YOU SEE A POSSIBILITY OF 50 BASIS POINT RATE CUTS AT MONTH? JAMES: IS INTERESTING. I HEARD LIZZIE ASKING ABOUT 50 AND HE SAID THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY UNLESS THERE WAS A CONTRACTION. WE PROBABLY AGREE. IF WE GET A NEGATIVE PAYROLLS PRINT, AS WE KNOW FROM HISTORY, THAT STARTS TO SHARPEN THE FOCUS OF SOME OF THE MINDS ON THE FOMC WHO ARE WAVERING. AND OF COURSE THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN GROWTH AND INFLATION PROBABLY SHIFTS SIGNIFICANTLY TOWARDS MANAGING THE BROADER ECONOMY RATHER THAN WHAT ARE REALLY DIFFICULT TO ANALYZE PRICE PRESSURES IN THE SHORT TERM. CERTAINLY, I DON'T THINK WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SORT OF PRICE PRESSURES THAT WE SAW AFTER THE PANDEMIC. I -- AS I SAID IN THE QUOTE ON THE SCREEN, IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET WHEN IT COMES TO THE SELF-FULFILLING INFLATIONARY PROCESS THAT CENTRAL BANKS WERE REALLY MADE INDEPENDENT TO SPECIFIC -- TO SPECIFICALLY DEAL WITH. FOR US THE LABOR MARKET IS KEY. IF WE GET -50 ON THE CARDS, BUT WE AREN'T EXPECTING THAT. VONNIE: A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT TOMORROW'S DATA, 75,000 JOBS CREATED AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE UP TO 4.3%. WHAT WOULD IT TAKE? NEGATIVE PRINT FOR THE MARKET TO BE SURPRISED. COULD WE GET SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE? COULD WE GET MORE JOBS CREATED THEN WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED? ON A SEPARATE POINT, WE HAVE A NEW BLS CHIEF. ON THE MARGIN TO STOP MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THIS REPORT? -- ON THE MARGIN, DOES THAT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THIS REPORT? JAMES: WE HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL OF PAYROLLS FOR MORE THAN A FEW YEARS. THE BROAD MARKET INDICATORS IN PAYROLLS HAVE BEEN IN DISAGREEMENT FOR A LONG TIME. THE HOUSEHOLD SURVEY RELATIVE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT HAS SUGGESTED SOME ISSUES. SOME I THINK IS MIGRATION, BUT SOME IS ACTUALLY JUST THE DIFFICULTY -- BUT ALSO THE BIRTH/DEATH ADJUSTMENT THAT THE BLS MAKES TO ITS PAYROLLS DATA AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE THAT THE INFLECTIONS OF THE LABOR MARKET THAT CAN MISTAKE JOBS QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY. WE SAW THAT IN 2006, 2007, 2 THOUSAND EIGHT. WE HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL OF THE PAYROLLS DATA, AND THAT ALWAYS RAISES THE QUESTION MARK.WENT NOW WITHOUT THE CHANGE IN THE BLS AND THAT DOUBLES THE UNCERTAINTY. OF COURSE, THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF MISSES IN EITHER DIRECTION, IT HAS TO BE A LARGE MESS, BUT MARKETS DON'T TEND TO TAKE IT THAT WAY. WE THINK THERE IS A HAWKISH ASYMMETRY THAT THE MARKET SCENES SET UP FOR A WEAKER NUMBER, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE SEE DATA WHICH CHANGES OUR TREND VIEW OF THE SOFTENING OF THE LABOR MARKET. VONNIE: WHAT ABOUT NEXT WEEK'S INFLATION DATA? DOES THAT HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO CHANGE YOUR MIND? JAMES: YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM TOGETHER. THE FED HAS A DUAL MANDATE. EVERYONE TREATS THEM AS TWO SIDES OF THE MANDATE THAT THEY HAVE TO JUDGE IN COMPARISON TO ONE ANOTHER. WHAT WE KNOW IS PRICE PRESSURES TODAY IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF WHERE PRICE PRESSURES WILL BE AT THE FED'S POLICY HORIZON. IF THE FED MAKES POLICY CHANGES TODAY, THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY ISN'T FULLY FELT FOR MANY MONTHS OR POSSIBLY OVER A YEAR. THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT DOUBLY DIFFICULT. FROM A MARKETS PERSPECTIVE, MARKETS WILL BE JUMPY AND JITTERY FROM INFLATION AND WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A SELLOFF IN RATES IF THE NUMBER IS HIGHER AND VICE VERSA IF IT IS LOWER. I DON'T THINK THE INFLATION DATA THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO SEE IS LIKELY TO SHIFT THE NARRATIVE AS MUCH AS THE JOBS DATA COULD. VONNIE: 5-10 YEARS WITH NO EXPOSURE BEYOND 10 YEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW ON TO OTHER TOP STORIES TRENDING ON THE TERMINAL. APPLE PLANS TO LAUNCH ITS OWN AI-POWERED WEB SEARCH TOOL NEXT YEAR. SOURCES SAY THE COMPANY IS WORKING ON A NEW SYSTEM THAT WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO SEERY THAT WILL ENABLE USERS TO LOOK UP INFORMATION ACROSS THE INTERNET LIKE CHATGPT AND AI OVERVIEWS ON GOOGLE SEARCH. HARVARD UNIVERSITY SCORED A LEGAL VICTORY IN THE BATTLE OVER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THE COURT RULED THAT THE U.S. ILLEGALLY FROZE MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN RESEARCH FUNDING. THE RULING PAVES THE WAY FOR THE FUNDING TO BE RELEASED TO THE SCHOOL. THE JUDGE DIDN'T ORDER THAT. HARVARD HAS BEEN THE MAIN TARGET OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO RESHAPE HIGHER EDUCATION. EUROPEAN LEADERS CURRENTLY MEETING IN PARIS TO FINALIZE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SECURITY GUARANTEES FOR UKRAINE. THIS COMES AS PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY SAYS THAT RUSSIA HAD RELOCATED 100,000 SOLDIERS TO THE FRONT LINE OUTSIDE OF WHERE THE KREMLIN'S FORCES TRIED TO SEIZE WITHOUT SUCCESS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. CHINESE REGULATORS ARE WEIGHING POSSIBLE MEASURES TO COOL ITS STOCK MARKET. WE WILL DISCUSS. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a VONNIE: THIS IS BLOOMBERG WREATH. I AM VONNIE QUINN IN NEW YORK. BLOOMBERG SOURCES SAY THE CHINESE FINANCIAL REGULATORS ARE CONSIDERING COOLING MEASURES FOR THE STOCK MARKET AS CONCERN GROWS OVER THE SPEED OF THE $12 TRILLION RALLY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST. $1.2 TRILLION RALLY, WHICH MAKES MORE SENSE. IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS ONLY A COUPLE OF YEARS SINCE WE SAW PRESIDENT XI TRY TO CRACK DOWN ON THINGS LIKE ONLINE GAMING AND EDUCATION. IS THAT THE TYPE OF MOVE WE WILL SEE NOW? > > I THINK PRESIDENT XI JINPING WAS NOT A FOR CARING ABOUT STOCK MARKET RETURNS BUT HE HAS PROBABLY CHANGED HIS MIND BECAUSE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS CHINA ENTERED INTO A FERTILITY CRISIS. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC IN 2019 ABOUT 15 MILLION NEW BABIES WERE BEING BORN EVERY YEAR. IT WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR FOR CHINA. NOT EVEN 10 MILLION BABIES WERE BEING BORN. WE ARE SEEING IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS WE WILL HAVE AN ONE NEW WORKER SUPPORTING THREE NEW PENSIONERS. CHINA AT THE CURRENT STAGE CAN'T SUPPORT HIS SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM. HOW CAN PRESIDENT XI, WHO MIGHT BE LIVING UP TO THE YEAR OF 150, MAKE SURE THE CHINESE ELDERLY HAVE NICE RETIREMENT YEARS. AS WE KNOW, THE HOUSING MARKET IS NOT DOING VERY WELL. THE VALUE OF HOME PRICES IS NOT GOING UP. THE ECONOMY ISN'T DOING WELL. THE PENSION SYSTEM IS OVERBURDENED. THE ONLY WAY FOR RETIREES TO HAVE A NICE RETIREMENT IS TO SEE NICE RETURNS FROM THE STOCK MARKET. THAT IS WHY I THINK AT THIS POINT HE STARTS TO CARE ABOUT STOCK MARKET RETURNS. VONNIE: WE WILL SO A CHART THAT SHOWS CHINA CURBING SPECULATION AT 20.15 LEVELS THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF MARGIN TRANSACTIONS IS THE YELLOW LINE. THE CSI 300 IS THE BLUE LINE. IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS THAT IS LIKE 2015? SHULI: THERE ARE A LOT OF SIMILARITIES. THIS IS A LIQUIDITY-DRIVEN RALLY, BUT THE RETAIL INVESTORS ARE NOT ENTERING THE MARKET TO THE EXTENT OF 2015. OF COURSE, THE GOVERNMENT IS WORRIED THAT THIS RALLY IS GOING TOO FAST. IF THEY WANT TO ENTICE FOREIGNERS AND THE RETAIL INVESTORS TO PUT THEIR MONEY INTO THE STOCK MARKET, THE RALLY CAN'T GO TOO FAST, TOO CRAZY, BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD SIT ON THE SIDELINES. THAT'S WHY YOU START TO HEAR THAT THE REGULATORS WANT TO SLOW DOWN THE BULL MARKET. I THINK THE REGULATORS NEED TO BE CAREFUL, BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IN 2015, 10 YEARS AGO, IS THAT THEIR POLICIES WERE TOO HEAVY-HANDED AND THAT KILLED THE RALLY AND THE STOCK MARKET WENT INTO A BUST. THIS TIME THEY NEED TO BE SOFTER AND HAVE A MORE GENTLE APPROACH. VONNIE: IT HAS BECOME A LITTLE DANGEROUS. IF WE LOOK AT AN AI CHIP DESIGNER, THE SHARE PRICE MOVE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, IT HAS BEEN BOOMING IN COMPARISON WITH CSI. THE COMPANY WARNED INVESTORS ABOUT RISKS OF TRADING IN STOCK. WE WILL SHOW THAT CHART. WHAT CAN PRESIDENT XI DO ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT? SHULI: I THINK WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS COME OF THIS YEAR, CHINA HAS THE SO-CALLED NATIONAL TEAM. IN THE PAST THEY CAME IN WHEN THE MARKET WAS IN A RUT. THIS YEAR THE NATIONAL TEAM FORMALLY ESTABLISH THEIR PRESENCE IN THE STOCK MARKET. THEY SAID WE ARE THE NATIONAL TEAM, TRYING TO COME UP TO SUPPORT THE CHINESE DOMESTIC EQUITIES. I THINK WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS GRADUALLY PULL SOME LIQUIDITY OUT OF THE BLUE-CHIP INDEX FUNDS AND INVESTORS WILL LOOK CAREFULLY. THEY WILL KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT TO THE VERY FAST PULL AND THEY WILL TAPER DOWN A LITTLE BIT. BUT THEY NEED TO BE VERY GENTLE, OTHERWISE IT WILL BE A REPEAT OF 2015. VONNIE: IT WILL BE FASCINATING TO WATCH THIS PLAY OUT. THAT IS BLOOMBERG'S SHULI REN. PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKS THE SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD HIS TARIFFS. THAT AND WHAT IS MAKING HEADLINES. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a VONNIE: THIS IS BLOOMBERG BRIEF. AND I AM VONNIE QUINN IN NEW YORK. IT'S TIME FOR YOUR FRONT PAGE NEWS. ON THE BBC, THE POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING A TRAM THAT DERAILED AND KILLED AT LEAST 16 PEOPLE IN LISBON. AUTHORITIES SAY THE MORE THAN 20 OTHERS WERE INJURED WITH FIVE IN SERIOUS CONDITION. LOCAL MEDIA IN PORTUGAL REPORTING THAT SUGGESTING A CABLE CAME LOOSE CAUSING IT TO LOSE CONTROL. NEXT UP, THE WASHINGTON POST, NEW LEGISLATION HEADED TO THE GOVERNOR IN TEXAS THAT ALLOWS ANYONE TO SUE DOCTORS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF ABORTION PILLS. WINNING PLAINTIFFS WOULD GET A MINIMUM OF 100,000 DOLLARS IN DAMAGES. GOVERNOR ABBOTT IS EXPECTED TO SIGN THE LEGISLATION INTO LAW AND AIMS TO STOP THE FLOW OF PILLS INTO TEXAS FROM BLUE STATES. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYS THAT IT WAS \"VERY WORRIED\" BY THE SALE OF CATERPILLAR BECAUSE OF ITS ACTIVITIES IN ISRAEL AND HAS PROTESTED DIRECTLY TO THE GOVERNMENT IN OSLO. THE WORLD'S LARGEST SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND REVEALED THAT IT SOLD OUT OF THE U.S. COMPANY LAST WEEK. SWITCHING FOCUS TO TRADE. PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED AT THE SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD HIS GLOBAL TARIFFS. HE WANTS THE COURT TO OVERTURN AN APPEALS COURT RULING LAST WEEK THAT JUDGED HIS GLOBAL TARIFFS ILLEGAL. WE ARE JOINED BY BLOOMBERG'S BRENDAN MURRAY WHO LEADS OUR GLOBAL TRADE COVERAGE. WE WERE EXPECTING THIS ACTION. WHAT IS THE TIMELINE NOW? BRENDAN: IT IS A FAIRLY QUICK TIMELINE. THEY ASKED THE COURT TO DECIDE BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK THAT IT WILL TAKE UP THE CASE OR NOT. IT'S WIDELY EXPECTED TO TAKE THE CASE UP. IF THAT IS THE CASE, WE WILL SEE THE JUSTICES PERHAPS HOLD HEARINGS AND HEAR BOTH SIDES OF THE CASE PERHAPS IN NOVEMBER. THE EARLIEST THAT WE COULD SEE AN ACTUAL RULING WOULD BE BY THE END OF THE YEAR OR PERHAPS INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2026. THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE RESOLVED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS OR WEEKS. WE'RE LOOKING AT SEVERAL MONTHS OF THIS TARIFF UNCERTAINTY HANGING OVER THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND IN PARTICULAR U.S. IMPORTER TO HAVE TO PAY THE TARIFFS. VONNIE: AS WE KNOW, ORAL ARGUMENTS TEND TO NOT BE WHAT SWAYS THE SUPREME COURT. ARE WE LOOKING AT FILINGS? HOW WILL WE KNOW WITH THE ARGUMENTS ARE ON BOTH SIDES AND THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WILL BE ASKING? BRENDAN: EXACTLY. IF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PUBLIC COMMENTS ARE ANY GUIDE, THEY WILL MAKE THE CASE THAT THIS IS THE CENTERPIECE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ECONOMIC AGENDA, THE TARIFFS, THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF AUTHORITY HE IS USING, RECIPROCAL TARIFFS. IF THEY WERE TO RULE AGAINST HIM, IT WOULD CAUSE SO MUCH DISRUPTION TO THE ECONOMY, THE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS, THE DEALS THAT HE HAS BEEN WORKING ON WITH VARIOUS COUNTRIES. THE REVENUE THAT IS POURING INTO THE U.S. TREASURY FROM THE COLLECTION OF THESE TARIFFS, IT SEEMS THE ENVIRONMENT THEY ARE TRYING TO CREATE IS ONE OF INCREDIBLE DISRUPTION. THEY EVEN TALKED ABOUT CHAOS IF THE COURT WERE TO RULE AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION. WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT THEIR LEGAL CASE IS AS THEY MAKE IT DIRECTLY TO THE COURT. FOR THE TIME BEING, THEY ARE SAYING, LOOK, THIS WILL CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IF YOU RULE AGAINST US, AND OF THE PRESIDENT ISN'T ALLOWED TO USE THOSE TARIFFS TO CARRY OUT HIS ECONOMIC AGENDA. VONNIE: IN SOME WAYS, THAT'S NOT THE SUPREME COURT'S PROBLEM. IT IS THEIR PROBLEM TO JUST ADJUDICATE ON THIS. IS IT A BINARY OUTCOME? THE SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS THE RULING AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WILL GET REFUNDS AND OF THE TREASURY DOESN'T GET REVENUE ANYMORE? OR THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS THE DECISION AND THE TARIFFS ALL STAY IN PLACE? BRENDAN: WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT AND WE ARE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE ACTUAL PROCESS AS IT GETS TO THE SUPREME COURT. THERE ARE SOME ANALYSTS THAT WILL TELL YOU THAT THE JUSTICES IDEOLOGICALLY WILL LEAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE'S DIRECTION. THAT BROAD INTERPRETATION OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY. OTHERS WILL SAY, LOOK AT THE RULINGS OF THE VARIOUS CASES THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS LOST IN LOWER COURTS AND THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THOSE, THAT THE STATUTE HE IS CITING TO JUSTIFY THESE TARIFFS DOESN'T USE THE WORD TARIFF OR TAX OR LEVY OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO TAX AMERICAN CORPORATIONS THAT IMPORT GOODS THE WAY THIS PARTICULAR MECHANISM DOES. VONNIE: THAT'S BRENDAN MURRAY IN LONDON. COMING UP, WE'LL CATCH UP WITH THE ROBINHOOD CIO STEPHANIE GUILD NEXT. STAY WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a VONNIE: IT IS 5:30 AM IN NEW YORK CITY, VONNIE QUINN YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. LEGAL HEADACHES ABOUND. PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKS THE SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD HIS GLOBAL TARIFFS. THE AI RACE IS HEATING UP WITH APPLE PLANNING A WEB SEARCH TOOL AND DEEPSEEK BUILDS AN AI AGENT. INVESTORS AWAIT MORE JOBS NUMBERS AFTERCOOLER THAN EXPECTED JOLTS DATA. THAT MAY BE WHAT IS MAKING SURE THAT FUTURES ARE EQUIVOCATING TODAY. WE ARE POINTED GREEN, BUT ESSENTIALLY MARKETS ARE LIKELY TO BE WAITING FOR TOMORROW'S NONFARM PAYROLLS REPORT. CONSENSUS REPORT IS 75,000 JOBS WERE CREATED. WE WILL GET A READING WITH INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS AND I ASSUME SERVICES TODAY AS WELL. WE HAVE TO READ THE MIXED EARNINGS INTO THE PICTURE. SALESFORCE IN PARTICULAR IS DISAPPOINTING. WE CAN SEE THE 30 YEAR YIELD IS DOWN ANOTHER BASIS POINT AFTER YESTERDAY'S DECLINE. WE HAVE COME DOWN ALL THE WAY FROM ALMOST 5% TO 4.88%. LET'S LOOK AT COMMODITIES BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING CONTINUED WEIGHTS IN OIL AS OPEC-PLUS LOOKS LIKELY TO INCREASE SUPPLY AT THE WEEKEND. GOLD IS ENDING ITS WINNING STREAK. IS THAT A GOOD THING OR BAD THING? I'M NOT SO SURE. WE ARE STILL ABOVE THE 35 HUNDRED DOLLAR MARK. GOLDMAN SACHS SAYING THAT IT COULD REACH $5,000 IF FED INDEPENDENCE IS DAMAGED IN A NEW NOTE TODAY. SOME STOCKS TO WATCH. CROSSING OVER TO LONDON, VALERIE TYTEL. VALERIE: LET'S START WITH SALESFORCE. YOU MENTIONED SOME DISAPPOINTING SALES GUIDANCE FROM THE COMPANY. THE STOCK IS DOWN SIX POINT 6% IN PREMARKET TRADE, MAKING INVESTORS NERVOUS THAT THESE INCOME AND SOFTWARE PLAYERS MIGHT BE BEATEN TO THE PUNCH BY NEW AI VENDORS INTO THIS SPACE AS HEAVY INVESTMENT IN AI TOOLS SEEMS TO NOT BE PAYING OFF AS QUICKLY AS SALESFORCE HOPED. LET'S STAY IN EARNINGS OVER TO HP ENTERPRISES. A BIT OF A MIXED PICTURE. THEY HAD PRESSURE ON THEIR MARGINS WITH THE CEO SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD RETURN TO THEIR REGULAR RANGE BY THE END OF THE QUARTER. ANALYSTS ALSO PREDICTING A RETURN TO SOME GREAT FREE CASH FLOW IN 2026 SHARES OF HPE UP 3% IN PREMARKET TRADE. SOME MORE EARNINGS, AMERICAN E COMING OUT WITH A BIG JUMP IN SALES THANKS TO THE SIDNEY SWEENEY AD. THE SHARES ARE FLYING UP TO 3% IN THE PREMARKET. THE CMO SAYS THAT THEY GAINED A CUSTOMER IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTY IN THE U.S. THANKS TO THE SELLOUT OF THE SIDNEY SWEENEY JEANS. VONNIE: AND WE GET TRAVIS KELCE NEXT QUARTER. THAT'S VALERIE TYTEL IN LONDON. THE ROBINHOOD CIO LOOKING AT STOCKS BEYOND THE MAG 7 WRITING, \"IT MAY BE TOUGH TO SEE THE S & P MUCH HIGHER FROM HERE BUT MARKET OPPORTUNITIES BELOW THE TOP 10 COULD STILL GO HIGHER, ESPECIALLY WITH RATE CUTS.\" STEPHANIE IS IN STUDIO. THAT LOOKS TO BE THE CASE. THEN WE HAD YESTERDAY WHERE WE SAW PLENTY OF DISAPPOINTING EARNINGS IN THE SPACE THAT SURROUNDS THESE COMPANIES. I'M LOOKING AT YOU, SALESFORCE. DO YOU STILL SEE OPPORTUNITIES? STEPHANIE: FOR SURE. SALESFORCE HAS BEEN A CONUNDRUM FOR MANY PORTFOLIO MANAGERS BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY GOOD THINGS BEHIND THE COMPANY, FOR EXAMPLE, BUT IN THIS MARKET YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE BAD THING IN THE REPORT. GUIDANCE WAS THE THING THERE. IT WAS DISAPPOINTING. YOU SAW THAT LAST WEEK WITH THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES. BUT THEN YOU GET COMPANIES THAT OUTPERFORM EXPECTATIONS, LIKE PEER STORAGE A WEEK OR TWO AGO. VONNIE: THAT IS A COMPANY THAT YOU PARTICULARLY LIKE, ALONG WITH UBER. UBER HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS AND OTHER PROMINENT INVESTORS ALSO LIKE THE COMPANY. STEPHANIE: IF YOU THINK ABOUT, WHAT ARE PEOPLE GOING TO CONTINUE TO USE VERSUS NOT USING THE FACE OF POTENTIAL INFLATION? IF YOU DON'T GET INFLATION YOU HAVE MARGIN DEPRESSION. WHERE CAN YOU SEE CONSISTENT USAGE AND UBER IS ONE OF THOSE. STORAGE WE THINK WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE USED, CONSIDERING AI -- IT IS THE ONE THING THAT IS GROWING RAPIDLY IN THE U.S. VONNIE: ANOTHER TREND THAT IS TAKING ON IS THE BANKS AS WE LOOK AT WHAT THE FED MIGHT DO NEXT. I NOTICED YOU ARE LIKING THE BANKS, PARTICULARLY REGIONALS. STEPHANIE: I THINK IT IS THREEFOLD. YOU REALLY HAVE TO FOCUS ON FISCAL POLICY. ONE OF THE LEGS OF THE STOOL IS DEREGULATION, WHICH HASN'T BEEN A BIG MOVE FOR THEM BUT IT WILL BE MOST PROMINENT IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, PARTICULARLY BANKS, BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN THE MOST REGULATED OVER THE LAST DECADE PLUS. IN ADDITION YOU WILL SEE A STEEPING YIELD CURVE, WHICH WE HAVE STARTED TO SEE KICK OFF THE LAST FEW DAYS. I THINK A STEEP YIELD CURVE HELPS BANKS IN TERMS OF LOW INTEREST RATES ON THE LOW END AND HIGH RATES ON THE HIGH END. THEN IT IS A MATTER OF I DON'T THINK THAT WE WILL SEE A MAJOR RECESSION OR GROWTH TO SLOW DOWN, ALTHOUGH THAT IS IN FLUX, AND BANKS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THAT. VONNIE: WHY DO YOU SAY PARTICULARLY REGIONALS GIVEN THAT WE SAW NO GROWTH IN ANY OF THE DISTRICTS? STEPHANIE: I THINK THEY WILL BENEFIT THE MOST FROM DE REGULATION AND POTENTIAL M & A ACTIVITY WHICH I THINK IS A PIECE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. YOU HAVE SEEN THE LARGER BANKS RALLY MORE THAN THE REGIONAL BANKS. VALUATIONS ARE A BIT BETTER. IT'S A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THOSE FACTORS. VONNIE: WE COME IN EVERY FEW WEEKS AND WE SEE MARKET JITTERS, THE BOND MARKET LOOKS LIKE IT WILL GIVE US SOME TROUBLE. A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER WE SEE DIP BUYERS EMERGE. IN THIS CASE IT ONLY TOOK ONE DAY. WE HAD DIP BUYERS BY THE END OF TUESDAY. WHAT ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS DOING? STEPHANIE: THEY ARE DIFFERENT BUYING BUT MORE ON THE SINGLE STOCK NAMES. NVIDIA WAS A LARGER BUY AFTER LAST WEEK. MARGOT AS WELL HAD A NOT GREAT REPORT -- MARVEL AS WELL HAD A NOT GREAT REPORT. UNH BEING A SELL. VONNIE: IS IT MOMENTUM BECAUSE NVIDIA HAD A LOVELY RUN UP AND THERE WAS SOME PROFIT TAKING, OR ARE THEY EXPECTING NVIDIA WILL CONTINUE TO RISE? STEPHANIE: A POTENTIAL CONTINUING TO RISE. YOU HAVE SEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS AROUND HOW EFFECTIVE AI IS AND THEN COMPETITION AND THE CHIPS SPACE. I THINK THAT OUR CUSTOMER BASE, THEY HAVE A LONGER-TERM TIME HORIZON AND THEY LIKE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SHIFTS IN VOLATILITY. YOU SEE THEY HOLD CORE POSITIONS HANDED TRADE AROUND VOLATILITY. VONNIE: YOU SAY THAT NET BUYING HAS BEEN INCREASING SINCE JUNE, WHICH WAS SURPRISING. IT WOULD SEEM WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE RETAILERS THAT MAYBE THE CUSTOMER IS PULLING IN THEIR SPENDING A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT THEIR SPECULATION OR INVESTING? STEPHANIE: NOT OUR CUSTOMER BASE. I'M REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF IT. I THINK OUR CUSTOMERS ARE PRETTY SAVVY. I'M SUPPORTIVE BECAUSE I THINK IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THE WAY THAT YOU WILL BUILD YOUR WEALTH IS THROUGH INVESTING AND NOT NECESSARILY YOUR DAY JOB. THAT IS WHERE I THINK YOU ARE REALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SWINGS UNDERLYING THE SHIFT. I THINK THEY ARE ALSO SAVVY THAT YOU CAN'T SEE THE S & P 500 MOVING MATERIALLY HIGHER FROM HERE. THEY ARE PLAYING THE VOLATILITY UNDER THE SURFACE. VONNIE: DO YOU HAVE AN AVERAGE LENGTH OF HOLDING? STEPHANIE: I WOULD SAY THE ONE PLACE WE CAN LOOK AT IS OUR ROBINHOOD INVESTOR INDEX, SOMETHING WE USED TO TRACK MONTH OVER MONTH SHIFTS. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE DATA FOR THIS PAST MONTH, BUT WHAT YOU DO SEE IS THE SHIFT IN THEIR PORTFOLIOS DON'T TEND TO CHANGE MATERIALLY IN TERMS OF THE LARGEST HOLDINGS THAT THEY HAVE. IT IS STILL NVIDIA. IT IS STILL THINGS LIKE APPLE AND AMAZON. A LOT OF THE MAG 7 IS 45% OF THE INDEX. TESLA HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE BIGGEST NAME THERE, OR AT LEAST FOR A LONG TIME. HOW MUCH THEY HOLD SHIFTS. IT'S NOT THAT THEY ARE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SELLING OUT OF POSITIONS AND COMING BACK IN LATER, THEY ARE JUST TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SHIFTS. WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF PROFESSIONAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS DO. VONNIE: YOU ARE STILL BULLISH ON CHINESE TECH AFTER THE NEWS THAT THE REGULATORS AND CHINA MAY BE STARTING TO CRACK DOWN. ARE YOU GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS? STEPHANIE: THAT IS A NEWS REPORT FROM THIS MORNING, SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT I'M STILL INGESTING. I HAVE TO DO SOME MORE WORK, BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN FEELING IS THAT OWNING AN ALLOCATION THE CHINESE TECH HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT IS, ONE, KIND OF HEDGING OUR ALLOCATIONS IN THE U.S. IT HAS BEEN WORKING MORE RECENTLY. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THAT IN THE TECH SPACE, IF ANYBODY IS GOING TO GIVE THE U.S. TECH SPACE A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY IT WILL BE THE CHINESE TECH SPACE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN ALLOCATION TO THAT FOR THAT REASON. VONNIE: I THINK THAT THE U.S. THINKS THAT TOO. IT'S WONDERFUL TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU. STEPHANIE GUILD, THE ROBINHOOD CIO. LATER, TUNE INTO OUR BLOOMBERG POWER PLAYERS NEW YORK EVENT AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE U.S. TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP. IT BRINGS TOGETHER INFLUENTIAL VOICES FROM THE BUSINESS OF SPORTS. GUESTS INCLUDE MARIA SHARAPOVA AND CARL ANTHONY TOWNS OF THE NEW YORK KNICKS. YOU CAN FOLLOW THE PANELS ON LIVE  . PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKS THE SUPREME COURT TO BACK HIS TARIFFS. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a THIS IS BLOOMBERG. VONNIE: THIS IS BLOOMBERG BRIEF. VONNIE QUINN IN NEW YORK. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TACKLING COURTROOM HURDLES, ASKING THE SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD HIS GLOBAL TARIFFS AFTER AN APPEALS COURT RULED IN ILLEGAL. THE ADMINISTRATION ASKED THE COURT TO TAKE UP THE CASE BY SEPTEMBER 10. I'M JOINED BY THE BLOOMBERG GOVERNMENT CONGRESS REPORTER. JONATHAN, SEPTEMBER 10 IS A FEW DAYS AWAY. IT IS THE SUPREME COURT ACQUIESCING? JONATHAN: IT SEEMS LIKELY THIS IS THE KIND OF ISSUE THEY WILL WANT TO WEIGH IN ON. WE'VE SEEN THEM BE DIFFERENTIAL TO THE PRESIDENT IN HIS AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS IN THE PAST, SO IT WILL BE A MAJOR TEST FOR THE OPPONENTS OF THIS TARIFF WHEN IT REACHES THAT STAGE, IF IT REACHES THAT STAGE, BUT IT SEEMS LIKELY THEY WILL WANT TO WEIGH IN. VONNIE: IN BLOOMBERG OPINION, IT WAS WRITTEN THAT THE OUTCOMES OF THE CASES, ANOTHER CASE AS WELL, WILL HAVE FUNDAMENTAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES. IF THE COURTS DECIDE THAT THE TARIFFS ARE ILLEGAL, WHAT PRESIDENT IS THAT -- PRE ECEDENT IS THAT? JONATHAN: TARIFFS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SET BY CONGRESS BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT IN DECADES. THESE ARE THE MOST SWEEPING TARIFFS USING THAT POWER AND USING A NEW THEORY, A LAW THAT HASN'T BEEN USED TO THE EXTENT HE IS USING IT SO FAR. AGGREGATE EVEN MORE POWER TO THE WHITE HOUSE, AS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR MANY YEARS. > > THE COURTS HAVE FOUND THE ADMINISTRATION'S FREEZE ON $2 BILLION OF HARVARD FUNDING ILLEGAL. IT HAS IN ORDER THE ADMINISTRATION TO UNFREEZE IT THOUGH. WHAT IS NEXT FOR HARVARD? JONATHAN: THE ADMINISTRATION WILL APPEAL THIS. THEY SAY THAT THIS RULING IS INCORRECT. THIS IS CERTAINLY A SIGNIFICANT WIN FOR HARVARD, BUT NOT A DECISIVE WIN. THERE ARE OTHER LEVERS THAT TRUMP CAN APPLY. THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE SCHOOL ARE ONGOING. THIS MAY EASE SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON HARVARD, BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY FINAL. THERE WILL BE MORE COURT CASES AND NEGOTIATIONS. VONNIE: THE OTHER MASSIVE EVENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINEE FOR THE FED BOARD OF GOVERNORS STEPHEN MIRON FACING A SENATE HEARING. WHAT WILL YOU BE WATCHING FOR? JONATHAN: THE CONTEXT HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE PRESIDENT ATTEMPTING TO FIRE GOVERNOR LISA COOK. IT HAS RAISED MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HIS APPOINTEES WILL BE INDEPENDENT. I THINK MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES WILL ASK SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS INDEPENDENCE. I EXPECT STEPHEN MIRREN WILL GIVE THEM ANSWERS THEY WANT TO HEAR. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF MANY REPUBLICANS BREAKING WITH TRUMP. THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE EVIDENCE OF THAT SO FAR DURING HIS PRESIDENCY. VONNIE: HE HIMSELF SAID IN RECENT DAYS THAT HE IS AN ADVOCATE FOR FED INDEPENDENCE, SO WE SHOULD EXPECT TO HEAR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT AT THE HEARING TODAY FROM HIM. LATER TODAY TRUMP PLANS TO HOST BIG TECH BOSSES IN THE WHITE HOUSE'S REDUNDANT ROSE GARDEN. WHAT WE KNOW THEY ARE PLANNING TO SPEAK ABOUT AND WHAT WE MIGHT HERE? JONATHAN: WE HAVEN'T HEARD DETAILS, BUT WE KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUSHING FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN AI. THIS IS SOMETHING THEY WANT TO BIG COMPANIES TO INVEST IN AMERICA, CREATE JOBS IN AMERICA, HAVE THIS TECH BE HOUSED IN AMERICA BESIDES THAT MORE SERIOUS POLICY IMPLICATION, THE PRESIDENT REDID THE ROSE GARDEN BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO HOST BIGGER EVENTS LIKE THIS. WE KNOW HE LIKES TO PLAY HOST. HE LIKES TO HAVE POWERFUL PEOPLE AROUND HIM. THERE ARE BOTH ELEMENTS OF THAT. HIS SOCIAL EVENTS AND HIS POLICY FOCUS AT THE SAME TIME. HE'S LOOKING FOR THEM TO MAKE COMMITMENTS FOR BIG INVESTMENTS THAT HE CAN ANNOUNCE AND UNVEIL. VONNIE: WE CAN EXPECT A LOT OF NEWS OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION TODAY. THAT IS JONATHAN, CONGRESS REPORTER FOR BLOOMBERG GOVERNMENT. STAYING WITH TECH, FRESH DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RACE. APPLE IS PLANNING TO LAUNCH ITS OWN AI-POWERED WEB SEARCH TOOL NEXT YEAR WHILE DEEPSEEK IS TARGETING THE RELEASE OF ITS OWN AI AGENT MODEL BY THE END OF THE YEAR. WE ARE JOINED BY TOM MACKENZIE. LET'S START WITH APPLE. WHAT ARE THE DETAILS BEHIND THE NEW TOOL? TOM: ANOTHER SCOOP ON HOW AI AND APPLE IS TRYING TO CATCH UP ON THE AI STORY. THE SEARCH FUNCTION WILL BE CALLED WORLD KNOWLEDGE ANSWERS. MAKE OF THAT WHAT YOU WILL. IT WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO SIRI AND MAYBE AT SOME POINT INTO THE SAFARI WEB BROWSER AND INTO THE SEARCH FUNCTION ON THE IPHONE. THE IDEA IS THAT IT WILL HAVE A USER EXPERIENCE INVOLVING VIDEOS, PHOTOS, AND TEXTS THAT WILL ALLOW THE USER TO GET ACCESS TO ALL OF THE INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET UNDERPINNED BY LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING. APPLE HAS BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH ANTHROPIC INTO GOOGLE. IT HAS ALREADY SOME FORM OR PARTNERSHIP -- A FORM OF PARTNERSHIP WITH OPENAI AND THEY LOOKED OVER THE SUMMER AT BUYING PERPLEXITY LAND A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL BASED IN FRANCE. THEY DIDN'T MAKE THOSE PURCHASES. IT SEEMS AT THIS POINT GOOGLE IS IN THE LEAD TO PROVIDE GEMINI TO UNDERPIN THE SEARCH SERVICE FOR APPLE.AS YOU SAID, EXPECTED TO BE LAUNCHED, RELEASED, IN THE SPRING OF NEXT YEAR. VONNIE: IT IS TAKING A WHILE IN SOME SENSE. RIGHT? DEEPSEEK, HOW COMPETITIVE IS THE CURRENT AI AGENT LANDSCAPE AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT DEEPSEEK'S PLANS? TOM: DEEPSEEK IS THE CHINESE LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL AND CHATBOT MAKER THAT CAME OUT WITH THE ONE MODEL IN JANUARY THIS YEAR THAT UP INTO THE NARRATIVE AROUND A LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY. SINCE THEN DEEPSEEK HASN'T COME OUT WITH MUCH OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE. ACCORDING TO OUR REPORTING THAT COULD CHANGE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WITH A CHATBOT THAT IS AGENTIC. MEANING THAT IT WILL NEED LESS HUMAN INTERACTION. IT WILL BE ABLE TO PERFORM TASKS FOR YOU LIKE BOOKING A VACATION. AT LEAST, THAT IS THE ASPIRATION. DEEPSEEK IS STILL IN THE GAME. THEY COULD COME OUT WITH A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT UPDATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. IT IS STILL A COMPANY THAT IS CLOSELY WATCHED. THIS IS TO SOME EXTENT A CATCH-UP STORY FOR DEEPSEEK VERSUS THE KINDS OF PLATFORMS THAT OPENAI AND GOOGLE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER WITH MORE AGENTIC FUNCTIONS. VONNIE: WE LOVE WATCHING RACES AND ITERATIONS. THANK YOU, TOM MACKENZIE, BLOOMBERG TECH EURO ANCHOR. STAYING IN EUROPE, LEADERS ARE CURRENTLY MEETING IN PARIS WITH THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY TO FINALIZE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SECURITY GUARANTEE IS FOR UKRAINE. THE EUROPEANS ARE LOOKING TO PUSH THE U.S. TO TIGHTEN SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA. JOINING US IS BLOOMBERG'S OLIVER CROOK. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS AND WHERE THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW? OLIVER: A REMINDER, THIS IS THE COALITION OF THE WILLING ARRANGEMENT THAT HAS BEEN BORN OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAT IS SPEARHEADED BY THE EUROPEANS. EUROPEANS THAT ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT UKRAINE AND ALL OF THE KEY WAYS THAT IT HAS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE FIGHTING THE WAR, BUT CRITICALLY THE DAY AFTER A CEASE-FIRE COME THE DAY AFTER PEACE, TRYING TO BREAK OUT A SECURITY ARCHITECTURE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE BACKSTOPPED BY THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S THE LATEST WE'VE HEARD FROM DONALD TRUMP OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS, A SOFTENING IN TRUMP'S POSITION ON UKRAINE SAYING THEY WOULD POTENTIALLY BE WILLING TO PROVIDE SOME KIND OF SECURITY GUARANTEES. YOU NEED TO FLESH OUT WITH THE COALITION OF THE WILLING IS WILLING TO DO. ARE THEY WILLING TO COMMIT FORCES TO UKRAINE AFTER A PEACE PROCESS IS UNDERWAY FROM THE NATIONS OF EUROPE, FRANCE, GERMANY? IN WHAT PROPORTION? WHAT IS THEIR ACTUAL FUNCTION? THESE ARE QUESTIONS WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO END SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED BY THOSE LEADERS IN THOSE MEETINGS RIGHT NOW AT THE PALACE IN PARIS. WE SHOULD SAY THAT A DAY AFTER PLAN IS ONLY RELEVANT IF THERE IS A DAY AFTER THE WAR, I.E. A PEACE PROCESS UNDERWAY. THERE HASN'T BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF INDICATION FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN THAT HE IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION, WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF THESE LEADERS TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT LATER AS THEY ATTEND TO IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS WITH DONALD TRUMP TO APPRAISE WHAT TRUMP'S INTENTION IS VIS-A-VIS VLADIMIR PUTIN. WE HAD A LITTLE LIGHT IN A PRESS CONFERENCES DONALD TRUMP HAS GIVEN AND OTHER ADMINISTRATION FOLKS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS, SAYING THAT BASICALLY TRUMP'S POSITION ON PUTIN AND HOW HAPPY HE WILL BE ON PUTIN WILL EMERGE OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. WE SHOULD SAY, THAT BEING THE CASE COME THE TRUMP IN HIS MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN, VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS NOT DIMINISHED ATTACKS ON UKRAINE. THEY HAVE ONLY RAMPED UP. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT ZELENSKYY IS SAYING THAT 100,000 RUSSIAN TROOPS ARE AMASSING AND PART OF THE DONBAS THAT RUSSIA DOESN'T COLLECT. DOES TRUMP THINK THAT IS A PERSON WORKING TOWARDS A REAL PEACE PROCESS? THAT IS WITH THE EUROPEANS WILL TRY TO CONVINCE TRUMP OF COME TO THINK THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CONVINCE HIM OF AT THE BEGINNING, THAT PUTIN IS NOT SERIOUS AND HE IS JUST PLAYING FOR TIME. VONNIE: A LOT OF FEAR IN TOGETHER. WE ARE REPORTING THAT ACCORDING TO A PERSON FAMILIAR THAT SPOKE ON THE CONDITION OF ANONYMITY , -- WE'LL SEE WHAT EMERGES. THANKS TO YOU, ALL FOR US. COMING UP, WE WILL GET YOU SET UP FOR YOUR TRADING DAY WITH MORE JOBS DATA ON DECK. THAT'S NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a VONNIE: THIS IS BLOOMBERG BRIEF, I AM VONNIE QUINN IN NEW YORK.

THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE CONFIRMATION HEARING KICKS OFF TO CONSIDER STEPHEN MIRAN TO BE FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR. LET'S GET TO MICRO MOVERS BEFORE THE MARKET OPENS. TESLA SAYS THE ROBOTAXI APP IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND THE STOCK IS UP 1.3% AFTER A POSITIVE DAY YESTERDAY. SALESFORCE EXTENDING HIS DROP IN THE PREMARKET REPORTING LACKLUSTER QUARTERLY SALES GROWTH, DISAPPOINTING INVESTORS. BROADCOM REPORTS AFTER THE BELL, HIGHER AHEAD OF QUARTERLY EARNINGS TO THE TUNE OF 1%, SO KEEP AN EYE OUT LATER ON. MICRO MOVERS -- MACRO MOVERS, POINTING HIGHER BUT FUTURE MARKETS ARE LITTLE CRITICAL WAITING FOR THE NONFARM PAYROLLS REPORT. OF COURSE COME THE EXTRA EARNINGS REPORT AFTER THE CLOSE. BROADCOM WILL BE IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT WE HAD SOME NEGATIVE ONES AFTER THE CLOSE. WE ARE ALSO GETTING NEWS THAT THEY ARE OFFERING TO BUY BACK 10% OF ITS EARLY BACKERS' SHARES. THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO WATCH AS WE APPROACH THAT OFFERING. 30-YEAR YIELD DOWN TO 4.876 FIVE APPEARING THAT CALMS OUR REPORTING TO THE LONG END DOWN ANOTHER TWO BASIS POINTS.

  "summary": "Stocks, Bonds, and the dollar have risen due to growing Fed-cut Bets amid concerns about potential global economic imbalances. President Trump has asked for the IMF to maintain his global TARIFFS, while the AI race heats up with Apple planning to develop an AI agent. Tech companies are seeing positive returns from their investments in AI technology, but some are worried about potential disruptions to new AI vendors. The Goldman Sachs report suggests that we could reach 5000 per ounCE if certain factors, including the Federal Reserve (FED), or the OPEC-pluss meeting, go well. Meanwhile, the US dollar index is largely unchanged, with the Dow Jones Jones Jones index down 6.8% off of expectations. The International Association of Investment Management (IAIA) is also showing signs of weakness, with Goldman Sachs predicting a potential solution for this issue. The IMF is set to provide an alternative solution for the situation.",
