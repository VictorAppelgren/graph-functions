  "description": "Trump's Plan for Putin Summit Draws Skepticism in Ukraine: Live Updates",
  "content": "In Kyiv, Ukraine, on Thursday. Many Ukrainians expressed fear that the White House was again being strung along by the Kremlin. Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times Ukrainians have reacted with caution and deep skepticism to the suggestion that President Trump can deliver an end to Europe\u2019s deadliest war in generations. A Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, on Thursday confirmed that a meeting was being planned between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in \u201cthe coming days.\u201d Mr. Trump had on Wednesday told European allies that he would follow such a meeting with a trilateral summit with Mr. Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Such talks, he said in public comments later, could lead to \u201cthe road ending\u201d for the conflict. (Mr. Ushakov, Mr. Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, declined on Thursday to discuss the idea of a three-way summit with Mr. Zelensky.) Despite the promise of talks, many Ukrainians expressed fear that the White House was again being strung along by the Kremlin. \u201cOf course, we shouldn\u2019t take all this as a prelude to the end of the war,\u201d Volodymyr Fesenko, a Ukrainian political analyst, wrote in a social media post, echoing a widely held view. \u201cOn Putin\u2019s part, this could be another insidious maneuver,\u201d he added. Mr. Fesenko said that Mr. Putin\u2019s approach could range from \u201cimitating real negotiations to trying to lure Trump into a negotiating trap in order to sell him a \u2018softened\u2019 version of peace on Russian terms, which will then be imposed on President Zelensky and Ukraine.\u201d The latest developments, Mr. Fesenko added, were a \u201cglimmer of a changing (and possibly deceptive) light at the end of a dangerous negotiation tunnel.\u201d Mr. Zelensky scheduled calls with leaders across Europe on Thursday as he sought to present a united front with allies before any summit. \u201cThe priorities are absolutely clear,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said in a statement, noting that Russia must agree to a cease-fire. He also called for talks to be structured in a way that \u201ccan lead to a truly lasting peace.\u201d Long-term security, he added, would be possible only together with the United States and Europe. Ukrainians have been through this before. In April, Mr. Trump wrote that a peace deal was \u201cvery close\u201d and that \u201cthe two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to \u2018finish it off.\u2019 \u201cMost of the major points are agreed to,\u201d he added. \u201cStop the bloodshed, NOW.\u201d Instead, the war continued. Russia\u2019s land offensive in eastern Ukraine has pushed slowly forward, while its aerial bombardments have stretched to towns and cities far beyond the front. While Ukrainians nearly universally want the conflict to end, the government in Kyiv has made it clear that it will not accept peace at any price. Recent polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that about three-quarters of Ukrainians reject any peace plan that calls for the ceding of territory not already captured by Russia \u2014 a central demand of the Kremlin. While Ukraine\u2019s government long ago accepted White House demands to sign up for a complete and immediate cease-fire, Moscow has repeatedly refused. Mr. Putin has maintained that Russia will continue to wage war until what he calls the \u201croot causes\u201d of the conflict are addressed. Mr. Trump offered no details about why he believed Mr. Putin might be ready to change his stance. It was also not known what Mr. Putin might have told the White House special envoy, Steve Witkoff, at their meeting in Moscow on Wednesday to suggest that direct talks might now yield a breakthrough. That has left Ukrainians in limbo as the war rages both at the front and in cities and towns under daily bombardment. \u201cStrategic uncertainty is the motto of the moment,\u201d Marina Stavniychuk, a lawyer who once worked in the office of the Ukrainian president, wrote on social media. \u201cA very complex international game is underway.\u201d\n\nA summit with Trump is key to Vladimir Putin\u2019s war aims. In a photo released by state media, President Vladimir V. Putin attends a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow on Tuesday. President Vladimir V. Putin has long said he wants to sit down with President Trump. The reason: He believes that such a meeting, rather than just progress on the battlefield, is his best chance for securing a victory in his war against Ukraine. Analysts who study Mr. Putin, as well as people who know him, have said since the early days of the war that the Russian leader\u2019s overarching goal is primarily to secure a peace deal that achieves his geopolitical aims \u2014 and not necessarily conquering a certain amount of territory on the battlefield. And it is the U.S. president, they say, who is best positioned to deliver on those aims \u2014 which include keeping Ukraine out of NATO and preventing the alliance\u2019s future expansion. That helps explain why Mr. Putin has appeared so focused on placating Mr. Trump and avoiding a break with Washington, even as Mr. Trump has shown growing impatience with Mr. Putin\u2019s refusal to agree to a cease-fire. \u201cPutin wants to keep Trump as a resource for a possible transition to peace,\u201d said Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst in Moscow. \u201cTrump is needed to achieve Russia\u2019s conditions.\u201d \u201cIt is probably better for us to meet,\u201d Mr. Putin said of Mr. Trump in January, \u201cand, based on today\u2019s realities, talk calmly about all areas that are of interest to both the U.S. and Russia.\u201d The Kremlin confirmed on Thursday morning that Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump planned to meet in the coming days, but did not set an exact date for the sought-after summit. The Trump administration had been holding out on agreeing to a meeting, looking for a sign from the Kremlin that Mr. Putin was in fact serious about a real cease-fire on the battlefield. Ukrainian firefighters work at the scene of a Russia strike in Kharkiv last month. The White House\u2019s sudden commitment to hold a summit has raised questions about what, if anything, Mr. Putin agreed to on Wednesday during his talks in Moscow with Mr. Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff. Exactly what the two men discussed is unclear. The Kremlin\u2019s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, said Mr. Putin had conveyed certain \u201csignals\u201d to Mr. Witkoff on Ukraine, but did not go into detail. One possibility is that Mr. Putin signaled more flexibility on the issue of how land could be divided up or traded in any settlement between Russia and Ukraine. For months, Russian envoys have insisted in talks with U.S. counterparts that Moscow be given the entirety of the four regions that the Kremlin claimed to have \u201cannexed\u201d from Ukraine in late 2022 even though vast swaths of the territory remained under Ukrainian control. U.S. negotiators viewed that position as unreasonable and saw it as a sign that Moscow wasn\u2019t serious about negotiating an end to the war. Some analysts suggested that Mr. Putin had told envoys during talks this year to stick only to the hardest-line position, in order to force a meeting between him and Mr. Trump. Russian officials may be hoping that a one-on-one summit will give Mr. Putin an opportunity to sway Mr. Trump, long sympathetic to Russia, back to supporting the Russian leader\u2019s views on what he calls \u201cthe root causes of the conflict.\u201d In a photo released by state media, Mr. Putin met with President Trump\u2019s envoy, Steve Witkoff, on Wednesday. People close to the Kremlin, as well as political analysts, say that Mr. Putin\u2019s demands \u2014 to exclude Ukraine from NATO, limit Ukrainian military capabilities and lay the groundwork for a more Moscow-friendly government in Kyiv \u2014 are more important to him than the specifics of what territory Russia ultimately controls. Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, pointed out that Moscow, from the start, hasn\u2019t formally demarcated the borders of the four \u201cannexed\u201d regions \u2014 which she said shows there has always been some flexibility on the land issue. She didn\u2019t exclude the possibility Moscow would be open to exchanging certain territories. \u201cThe most important thing for Putin is NATO and these ironclad guarantees that Ukraine will not be in NATO and that NATO countries will not develop a military presence inside Ukraine, plus a set of political demands on Ukraine itself,\u201d Ms. Stanovaya said. Other demands, she added, might be open to negotiation. \u201cOne quality of Mr. Putin is that he doesn\u2019t keep a pre-prepared plan,\u201d Ms. Stanovaya said. \u201cHe lives for today, he knows what he wants to get in the end.\u201d In this case, she said, what Russia\u2019s leader wants is for Ukraine to stop being what he sees as an \u201canti-Russia project\u201d and to return to Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence. \u201cSo, either he achieves this through NATO guarantees, that is, guarantees from the West, or he achieves this through political control within Ukraine,\u201d Ms. Stanovaya said. \u201cOne or the other, or both. Then, we\u2019ll see how it goes. Territory is very secondary.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia meeting in 2018 in Helsinki, Finland. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has agreed to meet with President Trump \u201cin the coming days,\u201d a top Kremlin aide said on Thursday, as the White House pushes for a cease-fire in Ukraine. The aide, Yuri Ushakov, Mr. Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, confirmed reports on Wednesday that Mr. Trump said he planned to meet the Russian leader in person as soon as next week and to follow up with a meeting with Mr. Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. \u201cThe American side has suggested, and we have agreed in principle, to hold a high-level bilateral meeting, that is, a meeting between presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Ushakov told Russian news agencies on Thursday. He declined to discuss the idea of a three-way summit with Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Ushakov did not give an exact date for the meeting, saying only that it was \u201chard to say how much time the preparations for such an important meeting would take.\u201d Russia and the United States have agreed on the place to meet but will not be disclosing it at this time, Mr. Ushakov added. The confirmation of a potential sit-down between the American and Russian leaders comes a day after Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump\u2019s envoy, held talks with Mr. Putin at the Kremlin. It was the latest in a flurry of diplomatic activity since the White House issued an ultimatum for Russia: Either agree to a cease-fire in Ukraine or face new sanctions. Meeting with Mr. Trump would be something of another minor victory for Mr. Putin, who had been largely isolated by NATO leaders over the invasion of Ukraine until Mr. Trump started phone conversations with the Russian leader after coming to office. If the meeting goes ahead, it would be the first in-person summit between an American and Russian president in more than four years.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs moved to strip labor protections for more than 400,000 of its workers \u2014 most of whom are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees. Jason Andrew for The New York Times The Trump administration has moved forward with a plan to end collective bargaining with federal unions across a swath of government agencies, even after arguing in federal court that it would not do so until a legal battle over an order President Trump signed was over. The Department of Veterans Affairs said on Wednesday that it had moved to strip labor protections for more than 400,000 of its workers \u2014 most of whom are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union for federal employees. The department\u2019s announcement included attacks on union activities and leadership, and Doug Collins, the head of the agency, argued in a statement that the \u201cunions that represent V.A. employees fight against the best interests of veterans while protecting and rewarding bad workers.\u201d Everett Kelley, the president of the A.F.G.E., said in a statement that the V.A.\u2019s decision was \u201canother clear example of retaliation\u201d against unions that have opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to slash the federal bureaucracy. Mr. Kelley accused Mr. Collins of choosing to \u201crip up the negotiated union contract\u201d of the majority of his work force. A federal appeals court on Friday had approved Mr. Trump\u2019s order instructing agencies to end collective bargaining agreements \u2014 part of a sweeping effort to assert more control over the federal work force. But the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which allowed the order to proceed, did so in part because the Trump administration had directed agencies not to move ahead with the plan until the court battle was resolved. Because of that instruction, the judges wrote, there was a lower risk of harm to the unions and their members. Two of the judges on the panel were appointed by Mr. Trump, and the other by President Barack Obama. With few exceptions, union employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs have now lost the rights and protections provided by a 308-page collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the federal employees union. Those include the right to have work disputes resolved by a neutral arbitrator, and to have union stewards and leaders be granted official time on the job to work on cases and participate in contract negotiations. The announcement by the Department of Veterans Affairs came as a shock to Eric L. Pines, a lawyer representing several local union branches for federal employees, including some V.A. workers. As the agency announced the contract terminations on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Pines was working on legal cases for V.A. employees he was representing. \u201cThat\u2019s how shocking this is, to everyone involved \u2014 the agency, too,\u201d said Mr. Pines, who found out about the action when contacted by The New York Times. \u201cThe agency was making arguments to the arbitrator as if they still had to make arguments to the arbitrator.\u201d Mr. Trump had framed his order stripping federal workers of labor protections as critical for protecting national security. But a group of affected unions argued in court that the order was a form of retaliation against unions that have participated in a barrage of lawsuits opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. The unions had also argued that the order broadly targeted agencies across the government, some of which had no obvious national security portfolio \u2014 including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 using national security as a pretext to strip the unions of their power.",

      "text": "ESC or click to close\n|\nPress releases and reports\nPerception of individual peace plans to end the war\nThe press release was prepared by Anton Hrushetskyi, executive director of KIIS\nFrom July 23 to August 4, 2025, the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) conducted its own all-Ukrainian public opinion survey \"Omnibus\", to which, on its own initiative, added questions about the perception of individual peace plans to end the war. By the method of telephone interviews (computer-assistedtelephoneinterviews, CATI) based on a random sample of mobile phone numbers (with random generation of phone numbers and subsequent statistical weighting) in all regions of Ukraine (the territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine), 1,022 respondents were surveyed. The survey was conducted with adult (aged 18 and older) citizens of Ukraine who, at the time of the survey, lived in the territory of Ukraine controlled by the Government of Ukraine. The sample did not include residents of territories temporarily not controlled by the Ukrainian authorities (at the same time, some of the respondents are IDPs who moved from the occupied territories), and the survey was not conducted with citizens who left abroad after February 24, 2022. Formally, under normal circumstances, the statistical error of a sample of 1022 respondents (with a probability of 0.95 and taking into account the design effect of 1.3) does not exceed 4.1%. At the same time, for the peace plans considered in this press release, an experiment was implemented and we learned the opinion of respondents about one of three randomly selected peace plans (to avoid the effect of the order of responses). Each peace plan was evaluated by 324-351 respondents, which gives an error (with a probability of 0.95 and taking into account the design effect of 1.3) of no more than 7.2%. Under conditions of war, in addition to the specified formal error, a certain systematic deviation is added. Factors that may affect the quality of results in \"wartime\" conditions were previously cited by KIIS. In general, we believe that the obtained results are still highly representative and allow a fairly reliable analysis of the public moods of the population.\nPerception of peace plans from the USA, from Europe and Ukraine, and from Russia\nIn May 2025, KIIS researched the attitude of Ukrainians towards three options for peace plans[1]. Now, in July-August 2025, we have re-asked these questions to track the dynamics of public moods. To begin with, we will recall the idea and methodological features of the questions we asked the respondents. Thus, in April 2025, information about the details of the peace plan from the USA appeared in the media and from public figures[2], and also about the details of another plan, which represented the joint position of Europe and Ukraine[3] (which was formed in response to the USA proposals). In addition, Russia continues to reiterate its demands for peace. In particular, later in Istanbul, Russia submitted the text of its Memorandum, which more formally reflected its demands[4]. As part of a regular survey (especially a telephone one), we cannot discuss the plans in detail with the respondents in full, because each plan includes many components. Therefore, we have prepared three shortened versions with, in our opinion, particularly important (from the point of view of public perception) elements. We are aware that the shortened versions cannot claim to be a complete reproduction of the proposed plans, but we believe that in our research version we have covered the important components and were able (as will be shown below) to clarify the differences in perception. Only one of the three plan options was randomly selected and read to the respondent (to avoid the effect of the order of the questions). At the same time, we did not say that this plan was from the USA / from Europe with Ukraine / from Russia, since the \u201cauthorship\u201d of the plan in the text of the question can significantly affect the perception by the respondents. That is, we only read the conditions (which were also read in different orders to different respondents) and asked to answer how acceptable this plan was overall. Below is what we read to the respondents. Conditional plan of the USA:\nConditional plan of Europe and Ukraine:\nRussia's conditional plan (we have retained the version used in May, but it should be noted that compared to the Russian Memorandum, we have a conditionally positive point - the move towards EU accession):\nSo, the following conclusions can be drawn. First, compared to May 2025, there is a tendency to increase the share of those who are ready (although mostly reluctantly) to support each of the proposed plans. However, secondly, the general picture remains the same and the peace plan from Russia (i.e. the surrender of Ukraine) is rejected by the absolute majority of the population, while the peace plan from the USA has more opponents than supporters. And as in May 2025, the only plan that can be the subject of discussions and approval by the Ukrainian public is a joint plan from Europe and Ukraine. It is advisable to consider in more detail the perception of peace plans. So, 76% of Ukrainians categorically reject Russia's plan to establish peace (up from 82% in May).Can agree to Russia's demands \u2013 17% (up from 10% in May). 39% of respondents would accept the USA conditional plan and this indicator has increased from 29% in May (at the same time, as before, respondents mostly emphasize that this option is difficult for them). At the same time, for a larger share of Ukrainians (49%) the plan is categorically unacceptable (in May it was 62%). 54% are ready to accept a joint plan of Europe and Ukraine (in May it was 51%). Consider this plan categorically unacceptable \u2013 30% (in May \u2013 35%).\nGraph 1. There are different options for ending the war. Now I will read you one option, and you tell how you would feel about it. Use the scale \u201cI easily agree with this option\u201d, \u201cIt would be a difficult option, but generally acceptable\u201d or \u201cThis option is completely unacceptable\u201d.\nBelow in the table, the data are also given in the regional dimension[5]. Since the survey sample was small, there are few respondents in each region (especially in the East), so the data are indicative for understanding the trends. In all regions, the population is categorically against Russia's demands and only a small part is ready to accept its demands for peace. At the same time, regarding the other two plans, it is noticeable that the East stands out, where the majority is ready to accept them. In other regions, there are quite a lot of those who are ready to support and those who are categorically against them.\nTable 1. Attitudes towards conditional peace plans in the regional dimension\nThe table below also shows how those who trust/distrust President V. Zelenskyi feel about the peace plans. Those who distrust the President are somewhat more inclined to accept each of the peace plans. In the case of the Russian plan, although the share of those who are ready to accept it is also higher, the vast majority still speak out categorically against it.\nTable 2. Attitudes towards conditional peace plans in terms of trust/distrust in President V. Zelenskyi\nA. Hrushetskyi, comments on the survey results:\nDespite the aggressive actions of the Russians on the front and the brutal air attacks on civilian cities over the past few months, Ukrainian public opinion on issues of war and peace has not fundamentally changed. Ukrainians, as before, demonstrate openness to negotiations and the possibility, albeit reluctantly, of approving difficult decisions. However, the absolute majority continue to reject the demands for surrender (which is what the Russian Memorandum is). Russia is the only real obstacle to lasting peace in Ukraine. Only pressure on Russia \u2013 by providing Ukraine with the necessary weapons, imposing effective sanctions, disrupting the normal functioning of Russian life, such as paralyzing air traffic (see, for example, the reasoning of the president of KIIS, Prof. V. Paniotto, \u201cClose Moscow\u2019s airports!\u201d[6]) \u2013 able to force the Russians to move to constructive negotiations.\nAnnex 1.

Analysts suggest that Putin's primary goal is to secure a peace deal that aligns with Russia's geopolitical interests, rather than territorial gains. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelensky is emphasizing the need for a cease-fire and a united front with European allies, as public sentiment remains largely against any peace plan that involves ceding territory to Russia.",
