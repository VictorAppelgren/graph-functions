      "feedback": "The analysis presents a solid overview of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it can be enhanced to achieve world-class quality. First, deepen the causal chain by explicitly linking how tariffs impact specific sectors beyond inflation, such as consumer discretionary spending and corporate earnings, to illustrate broader market implications. Ensure clarity by defining key terms like \"core CPI\" and \"structural regimes\" for readers unfamiliar with economic jargon. Additionally, align the analysis with the multi-year horizon focus by discussing long-term implications of current trends, such as potential shifts in consumer behavior and investment strategies. Incorporate specific numerical data to quantify the impact of tariffs and inflation on consumer prices and corporate margins, avoiding vague statements. Lastly, increase citation density by referencing more sources to support claims, particularly regarding the Fed's policy reactions and market expectations. This will enhance credibility and provide a more comprehensive view of the economic landscape.",
