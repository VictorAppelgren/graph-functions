      "feedback": "Your draft is on the right track but still over‑spreads the narrative and repeats the same points. Tighten the causal chain to a single, linear path: Fed cut → 2‑yr/10‑yr steepening → lower term premium → higher dollar yield → DXY rally. Keep one canonical handle per sentence (e.g., DXY, ust10y, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread) and attach a single, precise citation ID. Remove the paragraph that repeats the “short‑term upside” discussion; merge it into the risk section. Add explicit magnitude ranges for each link (e.g., 57‑bp steepening → +0.5 % DXY, 25‑bp cut → 0.5–1 % rally). Include the August 30 PCE and 31 NFP as the only short‑term catalysts, citing (7XH2DKEKV). Add a risk bullet on a Fed rate hike, citing (LF0UUL917). Finally, end with a concise watch‑list: “Sept 25 Fed cut, Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread.” This will satisfy the 1‑handle, 1‑catalyst rule and deliver a defensible, actionable view.",
