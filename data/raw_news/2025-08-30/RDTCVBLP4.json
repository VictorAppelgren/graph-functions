  "title": "U.S. Open Day 6 recap: American joy and heartache as Townsend wins but Tiafoe and Shelton exit",
  "description": "Two of America's most compelling stars exited the U.S. Open, but the star of the tournament kept shining.",
  "content": "The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 U.S. Open, and you can follow all the U.S. Open coverage, too.\n\nWelcome to the U.S. Open briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories on each day of the tournament.\n\nOn Day 6, U.S. hopes suffered 60 minutes of horror, a former champion hit a familiar ceiling and \u2026\n\nIn about 60 minutes Friday, a lot of hometown hopes for a second week filled with big-time energy and tennis acrobatics disappeared like air out of a balloon.\n\nFirst Ben Shelton, the No. 6 seed who was in glorious form all hard-court season, sustained a shoulder injury while leading Adrian Mannarino of France in Louis Armstrong Stadium. He toughed out another set, struggling to turn over his forehand and in noticeable pain. After Mannarino won it, Shelton was done.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell how serious the injury might be, but Shelton is a power player who puts tremendous stress on his shoulder with his serves and forehand. This is not the thing he wants to be managing so early in his career. He\u2019s just 22 and was playing the best tennis of his life the past few months.\n\nWhile Shelton was struggling, Frances Tiafoe, a two-time U.S. Open semifinalist and crowd favorite, was on his way to defeat to qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany.\n\nStruff had Tiafoe on his heels for most of the afternoon, taking advantage of what Tiafoe said were slick conditions on Grandstand.\n\n\u201cI was late on everything,\u201d Tiafoe said.\n\n\u201cI thought I still had some looks to be aggressive and take charge a little bit, and I just didn\u2019t. It\u2019s going to be hard to swallow how I played today and being out of the U.S. Open, for sure, this early.\u201d\n\nThere was some American success before and after. Last year\u2019s finalist Jessica Pegula and world No. 58 Ann Li made it to the fourth round in the day, but last year\u2019s semifinalist Emma Navarro later fell to Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 as evening arrived. In the night session, Taylor Townsend continued her stunning U.S. Open story by upsetting Mirra Andreeva, before Taylor Fritz, also a finalist last year, beat Swiss qualifier J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kym to advance.\n\nBut for Shelton and Tiafoe, two crowd favorites and staples of the late stages in recent years, it was a chastening afternoon at the tournament they rise for like no other.\n\nEmma Raducanu lost to three players at the four Grand Slams this year: Iga \u015awi\u0105tek twice, Aryna Sabalenka and now Elena Rybakina. With the exception of her loss to world No. 1 Sabalenka at Wimbledon, in which the 22-year-old Brit led 4-2 in the opening set, they have all been one-sided defeats. These heavy losses to Grand Slam champions, in which Raducanu has not won a set, neatly encapsulate her current level: solid and improving, but overpowered when she meets the sport\u2019s elite.\n\nRybakina, the No. 9 seed at the U.S. Open, hammered Raducanu 6-1, 6-2 Friday, and the generally comprehensive defeats have taken the shine off the signs of promise in the earlier rounds of each event. Three third rounds, plus a second-round defeat at the French Open, are reasonable foundations for next year, and there\u2019s certainly an argument that such tough early draws have scrubbed the otherwise viable possibility of a deep run at a major.\n\nThere is no doubt that Raducanu has made big improvements in 2025, taking full advantage of generally staying healthy for the first time in several seasons. She got to world No. 33 a few weeks ahead of the U.S. Open, a career high since the points from winning the 2021 U.S. Open fell off three years ago. Should she keep moving up, she will start getting seeded at the majors and become more likely to get more favorable draws.\n\nWorking with new coach Francis Roig, a longtime lieutenant of Rafael Nadal, Raducanu\u2019s serve has improved and she has tried to play more on the front foot. Her more default setting is to hustle and compete, but that way of winning gets taken away from her by the best players in the world. The penultimate point of the penultimate game against Rybakina summed that up, as Raducanu stuck around in a rally but remained mostly powerless as Rybakina gradually wore her down and then flicked away a backhand winner. The 2022 Wimbledon champion played well, but her first serve percentage was down at 47 percent, so this wasn\u2019t a vintage display from Rybakina.\n\nRaducanu raised both her floor and ceiling this year, but her one win in 10 top-10 matches in 2025 shows there is still a limit to what she can do against the very best. Improving that record will be her and Roig\u2019s priority for the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a goal for sure, and a target,\u201d Raducanu said in her post-match news conference. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve lost to Iga twice, Aryna and Elena, so it\u2019s tough.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, that\u2019s where I\u2019m at with my ranking. I can play top opponents in the first, second or third round. So I\u2019ve just got to do my best in the next few months until Australia to just keep working to try and close the gap.\n\n\u201cI think depending on the day, depending on how we match up, I think I\u2019m getting better overall.\u201d\n\nCarlos Alcaraz locks his knee and then locks down\n\nThe difficulty of playing an injured player is a well-established tennis cliche. But generally that\u2019s because it frazzles the fit player, who doesn\u2019t know how best to exploit the opponent\u2019s possible physical weakness.\n\nIn the case of Carlos Alcaraz, a medical timeout for a jarred-looking knee was bad news for Luciano Darderi for the opposite reason: It prompted the Spaniard to go supersonic.\n\nAlcaraz had just been broken when he had his knee worked on for a few minutes, and when the tennis resumed, Darderi was serving down 5-4. Instead of Darderi being flummoxed by Alcaraz\u2019s condition, the world No. 2 produced the outstanding game of the match. He opened the game with a forehand return winner off a first serve, before hitting a whipped forehand that Darderi couldn\u2019t control, and producing some incredible defense then earned him a couple of set points. A disbelieving Darderi double-faulted to hand Alcaraz the set, and that was it.\n\nAlcaraz didn\u2019t lose another game as he rolled past the Italian No. 32 seed 6-2, 6-4, 6-0.\n\nAlcaraz played down the severity of his knee injury after the match. \u201cOn the last point after the serve, the first step, I just feel something in the knee that, I mean, it was bother(ing) me,\u201d he said in a news conference.\n\n\u201cI was worried after that. That\u2019s why I ask for the physio. But, after five, six points, it was gone \u2026 After that, I just didn\u2019t feel it anymore, and it was good. So it\u2019s just about nothing serious.\u201d\n\nThe return of a U.S. Open motif\n\nJasmine Paolini has backed up her two Grand Slam final appearances last year \u2014 just not at the Grand Slams. The Italian, who reached the championship match at the French Open and Wimbledon and lost them both but won the support of tennis fans all over, has made herself a fixture of the top 10 with strong performances at WTA 1000 level, the rung below the four majors. She won the Italian Open; she reached the Miami Open semifinals.\n\nBut Paolini, 29, has not gone beyond the fourth round of a Grand Slam. At the final one of the year, she exited early again \u2014 with the additional pain of being part of the cutest ritual of disrespect in sports.\n\nNo. 7 seed Paolini and 2023 Wimbledon champion Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 produced an opening set of thrilling tennis in their third-round match on Grandstand, with Paolini\u2019s heavy ball and all-action intensity in contrast with the Czech\u2019s more languid, geometric style.\n\nThat was until Paolini made a few errors in the first-set tiebreak, which Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 won 7-4. After that, Paolini\u2019s game slightly fell apart. She went down 4-1, before playing a 13-minute service game with the Czech trying to force her way to a 5-1 lead and Paolini trying to use the energy of a fervently pro-Italy crowd to get her energy back.\n\nBut Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 took it, which was the cue for the fuzzy yellow harbingers of doom to descend. There are jumbo tennis balls at most tennis events, but at the U.S. Open, they are particularly prominent and have a particular purpose. With full stadiums and large crowds on every court, kids \u2014 and adults \u2014 in search of autographs will hustle down to the front row with their cargo whenever they think a match is about to end. But tennis is a sport whose scoring system has no deadline, so the bobbing yellow wave cannot time its approach. Instead, it acts as the equivalent of a Roman emperor\u2019s thumbs down.\n\nWith Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 serving for the match, the emperors decided that Paolini was not long for the contest and hustled down. A few points later, they were proved right.\n\u2022 Jessica Pegula (4) continued her relatively serene path through the draw with a 6-1, 7-5 win over Victoria Azarenka, the two-time Grand Slam champion of the 2010s.\n\u2022 Benjamin Bonzi saw his wild week at the U.S. Open end with a four-set defeat to a fellow Frenchman. Bonzi, whose opening-night match with Daniil Medvedev sparked the tournament into life, lost to Arthur Rinderknech 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.\n\u2022 Aryna Sabalenka (1) came through a tricky assignment against Leylah Fernandez (31) in what is becoming a signature fashion for 2025: eke out a first service game after saving some break points, develop some rhythm and then win. The defending champion triumphed 6-3, 7-6(2) to continue her other 2025 signature: winning tiebreaks. She is now 20-1 on the year.\n\u2022 Novak Djokovic (7) recovered from a tweaked back muscle and a lost tiebreak to beat Cameron Norrie 6-4, 6-7(4), 6-2, 6-3.\n\nBen Shelton\u2019s retirement was sad for tennis, but he still lit up his match with Adrian Mannarino.\n\n\ud83c\udfbe Linda Noskov\u00e1 (21) vs. Karolina Muchov\u00e1 (11)\n\n 11 a.m. ET on ESPN2/ESPN+\n\nAn all-Czech clash of completely contrasting styles lands on Grandstand for the opening match of the day. Noskov\u00e1 is all ballstriking and Muchov\u00e1 is all finesse \u2026 Except for the fact that Noskov\u00e1 has a sneaky good drop shot and Muchov\u00e1 can lace forehands with anyone on the WTA Tour. Muchov\u00e1\u2019s previous match against Sorana C\u00eerstea of Romania was epic, so her conditioning will likely be a factor, but the two-time U.S. Open semifinalist starts as the favorite for her ability to take Noskov\u00e1 out of rhythm.\n\n\ud83c\udfbe Magdalena Fr\u0119ch (28) vs. Coco Gauff (3)\n\n 11:30 a.m. ET on ESPN2/ESPN+\n\nGauff won her three previous meetings with Poland\u2019s Fr\u0119ch, but she has never played her two days after being moved to tears by the pressure of remodeling her serve in real time, at her most important tournament, in front of 24,000 people inside the biggest stadium in the sport. Gauff fought through to beat Donna Veki\u0107 in a tense, surreal match on Arthur Ashe. The morning slot should be less exposing.\n\n\ud83c\udfbe Jannik Sinner (1) vs. Denis Shapovalov (27)\n\n 1 p.m. ET (estimated) on ESPN2/ESPN+\n\nThere could be some needle in this match, with Shapovalov one of the most outspoken players regarding Sinner\u2019s anti-doping case and its resolution. The Canadian possesses the raw power and hyper-aggressiveness required to trouble someone with Sinner\u2019s metronomic consistency, but beating the Italian these days also requires the ability to disrupt the actual rhythm of his game. Shapovalov, who can go blow for blow with anyone, may find that raw power blunted.\n\n\ud83c\udfbe Alexander Bublik (23) vs. Tommy Paul (14)\n\n 8:30 p.m. ET on ESPN2/ESPN+\n\nTwo of the most entertaining players on the ATP Tour clash for the last match of the night session on Arthur Ashe. Bublik brings the improvisational touch and feel along with a howitzer first serve; Paul is all skittering athleticism and inventive power, like a live wire transformed into a tennis player. Both are prone to flights of concentration, so expect some one-sided sets before, fans can hope, both players hit their peaks at the same time and produce a match from the Gods.\n\nTell us what you noticed on the sixth day\u2026",

Ben Shelton, the No. 6 seed, sustained a shoulder injury and was unable to turn over his forehand. Frances Tiafoe, a two-time U.K. Open semifinalist and crowd favorite, was defeated by Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany. Taylor Townsend continued her stunning U.N.

Emma Raducanu's current level is solid and improving, but overpowered when she meets the elite. Her next step is to improve and become more seeded at the majors.",

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage from Day 6 of the 2025 U.S. Open.\nFLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. \u2014 As Coco Gauff\u2019s second-round U.S. Open match against Donna Veki\u0107 awaited its 12th game, a surreal scene unfolded on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Upbeat music blared around the arena as 24,000 spectators watched Gauff, the world No. 3, practice her serve while Veki\u0107, last year\u2019s Olympic finalist in women\u2019s singles, received medical treatment to her right arm.\nAdvertisement\nMinutes prior, Gauff had been shaking as she sat down in her chair down 6-5, having just been broken on the back of serving two double faults. The American has laid herself bare for her most important tournament of the season by attempting to remodel her serve in real time, and against Veki\u0107 she was double-faulting in the extreme.\nServes flew close to the baseline, even as she took pace off the ball. Gauff had been in tears at a previous changeover, living out something close to a serve anxiety dream on the biggest stage in the sport. In a post-match news conference she said it was \u201cthe worst I\u2019ve ever felt on the court.\u201d\n\u201cI think it was just nerves and just pressure, honestly, and I\u2019m someone that usually can thrive on that. There\u2019s been a lot on me this tournament, more than usual, which I expected coming in. So yeah, basically what you saw out there was what it was, and I was able to reset through it.\u201d\nThe tears had flowed again as she thanked the crowd in her on-court interview for giving her \u201cso much joy\u201d during the match, reflecting on a \u201ctough couple of weeks\u201d and her pride in having managed her way to a 7-6(5), 6-2 win.\nWhile Gauff was practicing the most important shot in tennis in front of the whole world, Veki\u0107 was having her hitting elbow examined while waiting to serve to take a one-set lead and not faring much better. Gauff, meanwhile, started to speak to her team, urgently trying to analyze what was going wrong.\nThe man brought on to fix her serve, Gavin MacMillan, had been offering encouragement throughout.\nWith Veki\u0107\u2019s medical timeout ticking down, Gauff hit five serves in a row onto pretty much the same spot, a couple of feet from the T. A boost, or a horrendously exposing exercise? Watching in real time, it felt like both.\nEventually, play resumed, and a compromised-looking Veki\u0107 began and ended the next game with a double fault to be broken to love. She hit nine in the first set to Gauff\u2019s seven, with both players visibly stressed by the weight of the pressures they were playing under. The United States Tennis Association promotes tennis as \u201cThe World\u2019s Healthiest Sport\u201d; at times like this, it appears anything but.\nAdvertisement\nGauff won the tiebreak 7-5 and picked up an early break in the second when Veki\u0107 made four errors, three unforced, to be broken to love again. A couple of games later, Veki\u0107 had nothing left to give, and conceded another break to give Gauff the chance to serve out the match. She double-faulted on her first match point, but flicked away a backhand winner on the second.\nThe roar of celebration after was full of relief \u2014 that she was through to the third round, but also that this was over.\n\u201cI think I just show people what it\u2019s like to be a human, and I have bad days, but I think it\u2019s more about how you get up after those bad moments and how you show up after that,\u201d Gauff said afterward about the challenge of trying to transform her game while the world watches.\n\u201cI think today I showed that I can get up after feeling the worst I\u2019ve ever felt on the court.\u201d\n(Photo: Clive Brunskill / Getty Images)"

      "text": "On Tuesday, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced that men\u2019s world No 1 Jannik Sinner had twice tested positive for clostebol, an anabolic steroid and banned substance. It also announced that an independent tribunal convened by the ITIA had reviewed its investigation into Sinner\u2019s anti-doping case, and had found \u201cno fault or negligence\u201d on the Italian\u2019s behalf.\nAdvertisement\nThe tribunal did strip Sinner of his ranking points, prize money, and results from the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, where the first positive test took place on March 10. The second took place on March 18. Sinner was provisionally suspended \u2014 as is mandatory for an adverse analytical finding (AAF) for a non-specified substance \u2014 after both tests. On both occasions, Sinner appealed against the suspension and an independent tribunal convened on behalf of the ITIA reviewed the appeal and upheld it, allowing him to continue playing.\n\u201cI will continue to do everything I can to ensure I continue to comply with the ITIA\u2019s anti-doping programme and I have a team around me that are meticulous in their own compliance,\u201d Sinner said in a statement on Tuesday.\nAll of these processes follow the Tennis Anti-Doping Program (TADP) regulations. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the fury from Sinner\u2019s fellow players.\n\u201cDifferent rules for different players,\u201d said Canadian Denis Shapovalov. \u201cCan\u2019t imagine what every other player that got banned for contaminated substances is feeling right now,\u201d he wrote a minute earlier.\nFrance\u2019s Lucas Pouille said: \u201cMaybe they should stop taking us for fools, no?\u201d\nNick Kyrgios, the Wimbledon runner-up in 2022, said: \u201cWhether it was accidental or planned. You get tested twice with a banned (steroid) substance\u2026 you should be gone for two years.\u201d\nThe American player Tennys Sandgren added: \u201cThis is ridiculous. Second-hand steroids through a massage?? ATP always looks out for their money-makers. Good for business, bad for transparency and integrity.\u201d\nPerhaps most telling was the opinion of Tara Moore. The ITIA provisionally suspended Moore in May 2022 after she tested positive for the anabolic steroids boldenone and nandrolone. Unlike Sinner, Moore did not appeal her provisional suspension, and then could not play for 19 months while under investigation, as is laid out in the TADP protocols. Moore was exonerated when an independent tribunal convened by the ITIA ruled that she bore no fault or negligence for testing positive. The tribunal found that contaminated meat was the source of her positive tests.\nAdvertisement\nThat decision is still subject to a final ruling from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\n\u201cI guess only the top players\u2019 images matter. I guess only the independent tribunal\u2019s opinion on the top players is taken as sound and right. Yet they question them in my case. Just makes no sense,\u201d she said.\nGO DEEPER\nWorld No 1 Jannik Sinner penalised after twice testing positive for banned substance\nThe example of Moore and her sentiments get to the heart of the reaction to Sinner\u2019s case. Even though the process has been conducted according to ITIA protocol, and even though comparing different cases is of little use, it exacerbates suspicions that double standards are rife in tennis. When those feelings alight on doping and sporting integrity, they inevitably catch light.\nThe best players get favourable scheduling, receive appearance fees from certain tournaments and are listened to more closely if they have a gripe about a certain issue. Players largely know and accept this, and the fact that the top players have earned their status. Elite players win matches, tournaments and prize money. They are a big draw for crowds and television networks. Tennis benefits from superstar names, with the overall investment and interest in the sport largely tied to their presence.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there is no resentment, even in situations that have nothing to do with perceived cheating or sporting integrity. Take the French Open this year, when bad weather in the first week meant most players had to battle through constantly rain-delayed and rescheduled matches. The best players were put on show courts with roofs every day and glided through the early rounds with no such worries.\nGO DEEPER\n'English weather' in Paris: How a rainy French Open changes everything on and off court\nWith Sinner\u2019s ruling, some players\u2019 comments reveal a perception of a superstar being treated differently in sport\u2019s most contentious area. Much of the frustration comes from a lingering feeling that tennis authorities pander to the top players, from umpires during matches to the ATP and WTA Tours.\nAdvertisement\nIn its statement announcing Sinner\u2019s penalty, ITIA chief executive Karen Moorhouse said, \u201cwe take any positive test extremely seriously and will always apply the rigorous processes set out by WADA.\n\u201cThe ITIA carried out a thorough investigation into the circumstances leading to the positive tests with which Mr Sinner and his representatives fully co-operated.\u201d\nIn 2017, when Maria Sharapova returned from her 15-month doping ban for testing positive for meldonium, she was given a wildcard to the Porsche Grand Prix in Stuttgart. The tournament even delayed the conclusion of its first-round matches so that Sharapova, whose ban expired on a Wednesday, could play in the event.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not OK,\u201d Barbora Strycova, another player who had been banned for six months for testing positive for sibutramine, a stimulant \u2014 which she argued came from a weight-loss supplement \u2014 said at the time.\n\u201cShe is Maria and what can you do? I will not get pissed off about it. I\u2019m a bit shocked actually with what is happening at the tournament in Stuttgart but I can\u2019t change it so I won\u2019t think about it.\u201d\nIt is easy to see why players, whether those like Moore, who have gone through ITIA investigations, or other ATP players, would have similar feelings towards Sinner\u2019s case. Simona Halep, who was provisionally suspended in October 2022 for testing positive for roxadustat, also appealed their mandatory provisional suspensions.\nSinner was successful but Halep was not, and the rejection of her appeal was what triggered the public announcement of a provisional suspension. Moore missed 19 months. Halep missed the same timeframe but returned after CAS reduced her four-year ban (imposed by the ITIA) to nine backdated months. CAS has not provided full written reasons for its reduction.\nMeanwhile, Marco Bortolotti, an Italian doubles player with a career-high ranking of No 87, avoided a ban this year when, like his compatriot, it was agreed that he bore no fault or negligence for his AAF for clostebol.\nAdvertisement\nTwo more Italian players, Matilde Paoletti and Mariano Tammaro, 17-year-olds at the time, tested positive for clostebol in 2021. The same process was followed \u2014 mandatory provisional suspension, appeal, investigation, explanation, tribunal. Paoletti was found to have \u201cno fault or negligence\u201d but Tammaro was banned for two years. Different cases had different outcomes. Another Italian, Stefano Battaglino, was given a four-year ban last November after testing positive for clostebol and an independent tribunal finding that the anti-doping rule violations were intentional.\nWhen it comes to how they are investigated, the cases are different in their evidence and in their complexity. This doesn\u2019t lessen the perception that players are being treated differently, or that Sinner has escaped what Moore, Halep (a two-time Grand Slam champion and former world No 1), and other players have endured. One of those benefits of being an elite name in tennis is surely a factor here: the financial access to swift legal support, and the ability to mobilise resources quickly. The players\u2019 reactions are directed at Sinner because he is the player in question but ultimately, they show off their feelings towards tennis\u2019 systems.\nThe upshot is that Sinner will now play at the U.S. Open from Monday, where he will likely be given the most convenient scheduling and all the other privileges the top players are afforded. How his fellow professionals will receive him remains to be seen.\n(Top photo: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images)"

      "text": "THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON \u2014 Aryna Sabalenka put her French Open troubles behind her Friday night by overcoming a hostile crowd and an at-times inspired Emma Raducanu to advance to the Wimbledon fourth round with a 7-6(6), 6-4 win. Afterward, she said that she feels like \u201ca different person\u201d to the one who imploded at Roland Garros a month ago.\nAdvertisement\nNo one questions the world No. 1\u2019s ability, but her struggles and loss in the French Open final against Coco Gauff invited questions about whether a raucous atmosphere got to her. She also lost to Gauff from a set up in the 2023 U.S. Open final, when she appeared overwhelmed by the support for her opponent.\nThe ingredients were there for the same thing to happen at Wimbledon, as a raucous Friday night crowd roared in hopes of inspiring an upset. Raducanu, their hometown player and the world No. 40, did not look overawed. To set up this match, Raducanu defeated Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1, the 2023 Wimbledon champion who recently beat Sabalenka in Berlin, and she looked to impose herself on the world No. 1 as she had Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1.\nRaducanu ultimately fell short, but this is a performance that will give her a huge amount of confidence. She has lost to a top player for the third straight major, but this was nothing like the hammerings she received from Iga \u015awi\u0105tek at the Australian Open and Roland Garros.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure soon she\u2019s going to be back in the top 10,\u201d Sabalenka said in her on-court interview afterwards. Raducanu said in a news conference that she appreciated the compliment and could take positives from the defeat but that the difference between the players was evident in the way Sabalenka executed at the key moments.\nBefore a ball had been hit, this was the first appointment-viewing match of the tournament. The world No. 1 against the great home hope. Both Grand Slam champions, and despite the vast difference in ranking and career achievements, two of the biggest names in the sport. Throw in an 8 p.m. start on a Friday night and the crackling excitement was there from the start.\nNot since 1977 had a British woman beaten the top seed at Wimbledon. The odds weren\u2019t in Raducanu\u2019s favour, but how much did odds matter to a player who won the 2021 U.S. Open as an 18-year-old qualifier?\nRaducanu needed to make a good start, to bring the crowd into the equation and see how Sabalenka would respond. The Brit kept her end of the bargain with an early break, but a run of eight points in a row from her opponent helped turn a 4-2 Raducanu lead into a 5-4 deficit.\nAdvertisement\nThen came one of the most dramatic games this court has ever seen. Sabalenka forced seven set points; Raducanu saved every single one, five of them with serves that forced Sabalenka into missed backhands. The noise that met Raducanu holding was so loud it sounded as though the reverberations would ring beyond the 11 p.m. curfew.\nIt got even louder a few minutes later when Raducanu broke again and had the chance to serve out the set. Memories of 10 years ago, when Heather Watson came within two points of beating world No. 1 Serena Williams on this court, at the same stage, on the same day of the tournament, came flooding back. It was deafeningly loud then, and it was again now.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Sabalenka said of the atmosphere in her on-court interview. \u201cMy ears are still hurting.\u201d She added that she had used the trick employed on the same court by Novak Djokovic against Roger Federer in the final six years ago, when he pretended the cheers for his opponent were for him.\nA seemingly frazzled Sabalenka broke back to force the tiebreak, but Raducanu forced a set point of her own at 6-5. At this point, Sabalenka showed why she\u2019s the world No. 1, producing a stunning backhand drop shot that completely outfoxed her opponent. People focus on Sabalenka\u2019s fearsome power, but it\u2019s the variety and comfort in adversity she has added that has turned her from streaky into a serial champion.\nThen, a couple of points later, Sabalenka finally clinched the opener on what was her eighth set point. A vocal player normally, there was no sound from her this time, just a knowing look to her team. She acknowledged after that she needed to stay calm and not make the same mistakes she had made in Paris.\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s also a reason why I was super quiet in that moment. I was just trying to hold myself, hold my emotions,\u201d Sabalenka said in her news conference\nAdvertisement\nIt would have been easy for Raducanu to fade after losing a grueling 74-minute set, but she dug in and broke early in the second, racing to a 4-1 lead. Her aggressive returns always felt like her most plausible route to victory against Sabalenka\u2019s often vulnerable serve, and continuing to jump on the ball earned Raducanu a point for a double break, 5-1 lead. Sabalenka saved it though, and then fended off two game points on the Raducanu serve to break back for 4-3.\nTennis\u2019 scoring system can be a cruel mistress, but the best players find a way to make it work for them.\nSabalenka had the momentum and raced through the final three games. It may only have been a third-round match against the world No. 40, but context is everything. This was a precious victory for Sabalenka, who had missed two of the past three Wimbledons. She is desperate to win here for the first time, just as she was at Roland Garros.\nAnd Sabalenka is trying to take positives from the experience in Paris, where she not only lost, but also carried her disappointment into her heavily criticized post-match interviews.\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of happy for what happened to me at the French Open because I had a chance to sit back and to look at everything in perspective and realize a lot of things about myself,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI kind of feel that I\u2019m a different person. I learned from that difficult lesson. Because of the recent experience, I just kept telling myself, \u2018No, you just cannot let it happen again. Whatever happens on the court, you just have to be respectful, you have to be calm, and you just have to keep trying and keep fighting.\u2019\u201d\nSabalenka did all those things on Friday night. She still has a long way to go to fully exorcize her Roland Garros demons, with No. 24 seed Elise Mertens next, but whatever happens from here this was a significant victory for the world No. 1.\n(Top photo: Dan Isitene / Getty Images)"

Raducanu, the world No. 33, has been without a permanent coach since Nick Cavaday stepped down in January.\nAdvertisement\nShe has worked with Mark Petchey, the commentator and former coach of Andy Murray, on an informal basis, but has been seeking a formal coach with Petchey\u2019s broadcast commitments prohibitive to a full-time partnership.\nRaducanu has enjoyed an upswing in form during their work together, reaching the quarterfinals of Queen\u2019s, the Wimbledon warmup in London, and the semifinals of the Citi Open in Washington D.C.\nRoig worked alongside Nadal\u2019s principal coaches \u2014 the player\u2019s uncle, Toni, Marc Lopez and Carlos Moya \u2014 for all 22 of his Grand Slam titles.

      "text": "One year ago, Taylor Fritz had a Grand Slam quarterfinal problem.\nFour times he had reached the last eight of a major; four times he had lost. Notoriously hard on himself, the best American male tennis player of his generation did not wear that record lightly.\nTwelve months on, Fritz returns to the U.S. Open occupying a different place in the sport\u2019s hierarchy, looking to end America\u2019s 22-year wait for a men\u2019s Grand Slam champion.\nAdvertisement\nAfter reaching the 2024 final to break his personal glass ceiling, Fritz last month backed up that result with a run to the Wimbledon semifinals. World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beat him last year in New York, and this year in southwest London, world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz took him down. Everyone in men\u2019s tennis knows the feeling, and Fritz\u2019s progress over the past year means he will be the No. 4 seed this fortnight \u2014 the highest U.S. Open seeding for an American man since Andy Roddick in 2005.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to the point where it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s such a big deal,\u201d Fritz, 27, said during a news conference at Wimbledon.\n\u201cWhen you have that feeling, it allows you to play your best tennis in the situation and the moment.\u201d\n\u201cExperience helps,\u201d added Paul Annacone in a recent interview. Annacone, who worked with serial winners Pete Sampras and Roger Federer and is on Fritz\u2019s team led by Michael Russell, emphasized how Fritz\u2019s having been \u201cto the rodeo once or twice before\u201d means he knows what is required.\nFritz has never entered his home major as such a contender, despite a rough year featuring several injuries and some recent underwhelming results. A Cincinnati Open defeat to world No. 136 Terence Atmane followed a straight-sets Canadian Open loss against Ben Shelton, who is looking to usurp Fritz as the top U.S. player.\nStriving to be the best he can be without putting suffocating pressure on himself, even during a run that falls below his standards, has been key to Fritz\u2019s improvement.\nFour years ago, he wrote a note to himself: \u201cNobody in the whole world is underachieving harder than you, you are so f\u2014-ing good, but 40 in the world, get your f\u2014ing s\u2014 together.\u201d By his own admission, he sets himself extremely high standards and can be \u201ca bit delusional,\u201d a quality that peers and friends, such as fellow player Reilly Opelka, remember from his junior days.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI would say he\u2019s not delusional, I\u2019d say he is very obsessed with trying to be as good as he can be,\u201d said Annacone. \u201cThat focus is a huge asset if he maintains his balance, which he\u2019s starting to get.\n\u201cNow he gets annoyed when he loses and he\u2019s frustrated when we talk about it, but he can move on. That\u2019s the change. When you\u2019re not No. 1, tennis is a lot of getting your backside kicked for a while. So his obsessive, compulsive desire to win everything, to always win, to be better? It can burn you out.\u201d\nFritz said during Wimbledon that in training, he\u2019s still as hard on himself as ever, but has learned to stay calmer during actual matches. He credits girlfriend Morgan Riddle with helping him stay focused and improving his results.\nFritz\u2019s game has developed along with his mindset during his rise to establish himself at the top of the sport. He has \u201cgraduated,\u201d Annacone said, from relying on his huge serve. His backhand is rock-solid and his forehand is more devastating.\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a remarkable job of having a crystal clear idea of what makes him the player that he is and not straying from it,\u201d Jim Courier, a former world No. 1 and now Tennis Channel analyst, said in a phone interview during Wimbledon.\n\u201cThe most important thing is his clarity of shot selection. It\u2019s when he is in an offensive position, whether it\u2019s the forehand or a backhand, trusting that his shots are good enough. Because they are, he can hurt you with both sides. The forehands come in quicker, but the backhand is pretty lethal, too.\u201d\nFritz has also further developed what was already one of the ATP Tour\u2019s keenest tactical minds. His news conferences have become appointment viewing, as he thoughtfully breaks down strengths and weaknesses \u2014 his own, as well as those of his opponents. During the Wimbledon semifinal against Alcaraz, he hit a monstrous serve while holding set point in the fourth set. Alcaraz somehow returned it, then won the point, the set, and, with it, the match.\nAdvertisement\nFritz later blamed his attention to detail, saying he had tossed the ball an iota too far to his right. That meant he sliced it a little, so it curved through the air toward Alcaraz and gave him slightly more leeway to get it back.\nFritz \u201cisn\u2019t going to do something just because you tell him, you better be able to back it up,\u201d Annacone said. His charge also shares another key characteristic with those two. \u201cMy number one trait that I look for is someone who\u2019s an unconditional competitor,\u201d Annacone said. \u201cThis kid competes, I would argue, better than anybody.\u201d\nBut having established his ability to compete with the best, Fritz now has to beat them. Sinner was much too good in last year\u2019s final, winning in straight sets, and Fritz has admitted to sometimes feeling powerless against Alcaraz. Last year\u2019s loss to the Italian still encouraged him because Fritz thought he had reached the final without playing that well.\nAt Wimbledon, things were different.\n\u201cThe way I played the first two sets today, there\u2019s not much any opponent can do,\u201d Fritz said after beating Karen Khachanov to earn the right to face Alcaraz.\nWhether or not that\u2019s \u201ca bit delusional,\u201d self-belief has gotten Fritz this far, and each time he plays Sinner or Alcaraz, he learns a bit more about how to beat them. For 2025, if the U.S. Open draw goes to form, it would be Alcaraz first in the semifinals, then Sinner for the trophy, again.\nThis year\u2019s problem may be tougher to solve than last year\u2019s, but it\u2019s a far more preferable one to have.\n(Top photo: Susan Mullane / ISI via Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the U.S. Open tennis tournament\u2019s new mixed doubles format.\nLike a lot of tennis fans, journalist Giri Nathan watched Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner duel into the small hours of the morning at the 2022 U.S. Open, bearing witness to Alcaraz saving match point on his way to winning a five-set thriller. It lasted more than five hours, and it didn\u2019t end until about 3 a.m. But instead of doing it courtside, he did it from his sofa, inscribing the contours what he calls a \u201cfuturist epic\u201d into his notebook.\nAdvertisement\nLike a lot of tennis fans, the match convinced him that these two were going to take over the sport. So he decided to embark on a book about it, as the two young men wrote the prophesy into reality over three years of incendiary tennis.\nNathan, a co-founder of the sports website Defector Media, has published \u201cChangeover: A Young Rivalry and a New Era of Men\u2019s Tennis\u201d with Gallery Books. He spent the 2024 season squarely focused on Sinner and Alcaraz, in which they split the four majors and accelerated their ascension into a tennis stratosphere of their own creation.\n\u201cI was fortunate that I picked that year, because they definitely delivered and continue to deliver,\u201d Nathan said during a recent interview about the book and the sport.\nSinner and Alcaraz have now won all the Grand Slam men\u2019s singles titles contested since January 2024. Novak Djokovic, the greatest player of the modern era with 24 Grand Slam singles titles, has described them as being \u201clevels above\u201d everyone else. Their rivals in the rankings say that Sinner and Alcaraz have changed the sport so much that their games look like they are made of tissue paper by comparison.\nThey just played each other for the fourth time in a final in 2025, in Cincinnati. Alcaraz won, after Sinner retired through illness down 5-0. Will the streak of finals continue at the upcoming U.S. Open? Barring an unforeseen injury, Nathan thinks so.\nAn excerpt from \u201cChangeover\u201d follows the interview, which has been edited for length and clarity.\nHow early an adopter were you on Alcaraz and Sinner?\nI was following some forums where people are following the junior events and minor leagues. Alcaraz was one that people saw coming a long way out, just because of the results he was having in the juniors. So that one was less of a surprise. The first match I remember watching of his was his first ATP win in Rio de Janeiro in 2020. Sinner was a lot more surprising. I only became aware of him when he started going on a tear in the Challenger Tour (the second tier of professional men\u2019s tennis).\nAdvertisement\nThe rhythm of his career was different than Alcaraz\u2019s.\nWhy do you think tennis ends up with these duopolies in ways that other sports don\u2019t? Bj\u00f6rn Borg and John McEnroe. Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. Steffi Graf and Monica Seles. It seems especially apparent on the men\u2019s side.\nAt the tournaments that really count the most, the majors, there\u2019s so much testing of these players that there\u2019s not going to be someone suddenly redlining and winning seven matches in a row. I do feel like the best talent does win out in tennis in a way that\u2019s not necessarily true in other sports, or a team sport in a single-elimination tournament. You\u2019re playing best-of-five set matches, so I think it\u2019s a real filter of talent. You get the actual top players coming out in the end.\nThe other stuff is a little mushier and intangible. It probably has things to do with resources. Money is concentrated at the top of the tour in a way that is quite unique. Endorsement money and prize money is all highly concentrated in the top 15-ish, 20 players. That continues to extend the competitive advantages that those players enjoy.\nIs it fair to say that Sinner\u2019s success has surprised you more or not?\nTo the extent I could have seen something coming, that was maybe slightly against consensus. His ballstriking always had that quality, from the first time I got to see it in person. So for me, even when he was having some of the struggles earlier in his career, with five-setters and perhaps conditioning too, I kind of always thought this guy was gonna figure it out. The quality of his ball was so anomalously good. I can\u2019t say that I predicted he would have a season as dominant as the one he had last year, but I really thought he would be one of the guys collecting Slam titles. With Alcaraz, that was more a traditional prodigy arc.\nAre you surprised Alcaraz hasn\u2019t won more?\nI think there\u2019s something very adorable about the Alcaraz fan base: they tend to catastrophize. He does have these somewhat inexplicable losses from time to time, but zoom out even a little bit and he\u2019s already on a trajectory to be an all-time player. Anytime I\u2019m a little puzzled by losing to a lesser player, I just chalk that up to part of the maturing process and think about how unbelievably ahead of schedule he is in so many other ways.\nAdvertisement\nWhat is your favorite Alcaraz vs. Sinner match at this point? I think I know the answer\u2026\nBefore Paris this year, it would have for sure been the U.S. Open 2022. That\u2019s when I first had the little seed of a thought to write a book to cover this rivalry. But right now, it\u2019s got to be this year\u2019s French Open final. It just seemed like it was one of those once-in-a-lifetime matches. It kind of sums up nicely where they\u2019re both at in the rivalry, because early on, you might have said it\u2019s Sinner the hard-court guy and Alcaraz the natural-surfaces guy, but it\u2019s gotten level enough that Sinner had three championship points on Alcaraz\u2019s favorite surface. And then obviously what happened after that point of the match is unforgettable too.\nWere you as surprised as everybody else that Alcaraz was able to save the three championship points and then come back?\nWhen he won that set, I texted a friend and I said, \u201cI think he\u2019s going to win this.\u201d He does have this way of \u2014 even if he was distracted, or his level was kind of unsatisfying earlier in the match, he just snaps into focus when the scoreboard is most dire. It\u2019s one of the most charismatic things about his tennis.\nHow did you process the email last summer telling you about Sinner\u2019s anti-doping case?\nHis camp had been quite cagey in terms of fielding interview requests for a while, so in one sense it was clarifying. But from a narrative perspective, it was a meaty topic that I need to start diving into. I wanted the book to still work chronologically, because I wanted to replicate the feeling of surprise that we had when we were following the season.\nSo I didn\u2019t want to foreshadow Sinner\u2019s case or lead off the book with it. It added a lot of psychological intrigue. There are some details of that saga that are only gonna be known by the people directly involved. We can ask all the questions. There\u2019s a lot of common dodges and evasions. Fans are never going to get that full, satisfying answer on certain questions.\nDo you think there\u2019s an asterisk next to anything that he has accomplished?\nBased on the information available, I would say no. I don\u2019t think that the concentration of clostebol that was found in his body would be performance-enhancing. There\u2019s some side theories about it being used as a masking agent. But I look at the risk-reward calculus for a player of his profile, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really worth it. That\u2019s not to say that I think the players are leaving other advantages on the table. I think they use everything toeing right up to the line of a banned substance.\nWhen reporting the book, did you get a sense of how much Sinner and Alcaraz actually like each other, and how each thinks about the other one?\nThat was one of the main questions I was interested in. They have a really good professional relationship. It\u2019s sort of like having a buddy in the workplace. But I think tennis fans and maybe even some tennis media like to portray it as more than that.\nDuring a rain delay at Indian Wells last year, they said they hung out in the locker room and talked about life. After the Beijing Open final, they shared the private jet to Shanghai. One of the things that I really liked writing about was those moments where they would talk in more detail about each other\u2019s game and what they admired about it, what the other had that they were still working on. One of Sinner\u2019s coaches, Darren Cahill, said that Sinner watches Alcaraz more than he watches any other player. It\u2019s an arms race to see who\u2019s improving, in what ways and how quickly, and how to keep up.\nAdvertisement\nSome people want them to hate each other a little bit more.\nI\u2019ve heard that from a couple fans. I get it. I also wonder if it\u2019s like a generational thing where I feel like these kids are just pretty well-adjusted and they can\u2019t summon that same hatred of past rivalries. I think it would add a certain bite.\nWhat surprised you the most that you learned about each of them through this process that you didn\u2019t know before you got into writing it?\nWith Alcaraz, he has this puppy-like public image. It makes it seem like he\u2019s always having a blast. I think he is often having a blast, but I think the last season definitely complicated that picture. Some of the burnout toward the end, the comments he was making about the schedule. He\u2019s not this comically optimistic and chipper guy all the time. He does have his normal ups and downs like any other person in their line of work.\nWith Sinner, I think a lot of the flatness or stiffness from him comes from being the kind of guy who, if he had his way, public life and private life would just be totally separate. He has to deal with it, because that\u2019s just the reality of being a top tennis player right now.\nThere\u2019s a moment in the book when I just watch him hanging out at the airport. That, in turn, really humanized it for me, and it reminded me that the pictures constructed of these players in the public eye can be kind of one-note. It\u2019s always fun to just catch those random little human moments.\nThey\u2019ve split all the majors since last January. How long do you think this will all last?\nI think it could last a while. I think some people say offhand that maybe the third party to really challenge these guys is still in his early teens, and I think that could be the case. A lot of fans and people in tennis are excited about (Jo\u00e3o) Fonseca. Physically, he\u2019s not quite on their level yet. So I think it could be just these two guys racking up the majors for another, I don\u2019t know, two, three seasons, who knows? It seems like you need a bit of injury luck or other luck to keep up with these guys.\nBut narratively, I definitely hope that some players can.\nWho\u2019s going to win more majors?\nAt the start of the summer, I think my answer would have been Alcaraz, in a kind of uncomplicated way. Having seen how Sinner performed on clay and then on grass \u2014 but also being two years older \u2014 I think I\u2019m going to still come out and say Alcaraz. But by a hair. I think it\u2019s going to be close the whole way.\nAdvertisement\nWith the physicality of the sport and the relentlessness of the schedule, it\u2019s hard to see either one lasting another 15 years, isn\u2019t it?\nThat was one of the clearest things to me in the course of writing this book, hearing week after week how this is unsustainable. You\u2019ve got this model that\u2019s built off of a sport that was far less physical, and then the scheduling demands are only increasing. I hope that for the sake of the players they figure out a solution, because we\u2019re not going to see that same longevity if it continues with the current state of things.\nThe following excerpt details their match at the 2022 U.S. Open, in which Alcaraz and Sinner played the computer-game epic that announced their incipient takeover of tennis to the world.\nAs the U.S. Open rolled back around, it was the hour of Carlitos once again. Novak Djokovic couldn\u2019t travel to the U.S. because of a federal policy that required noncitizens to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Rafael Nadal, who had suffered an abdominal tear earlier in the summer and played at the Open through visible pain, lost in the fourth round. Alcaraz became the favorite to win, but his path was laborious. In the fourth round, he played the veteran Marin \u010cili\u0107, who had won the tournament eight years before, and dragged the wunderkind into a five-set slog that lasted three hours and 53 minutes. Alcaraz won to secure his place in the quarterfinal against Jannik Sinner \u2014 the futurist epic that I stupidly missed.\nAlcaraz and Sinner were the No. 3 and No. 11 seeds, respectively. A fan coming to this match with fresh eyes would have seen that their gifts overlapped quite a bit. They had the finest groundstrokes of their age cohort, all precision and heavy spin, concussive power even when reaching for a faraway ball. But there were also some key differences. Alcaraz was superior in foot speed and vertical leap, and his shot selection skewed far spicier, thanks in part to his softer hands. Sinner had a longer wingspan, once-in-a-generation timing that produced outlandish power with minimal energy expenditure, and a sturdier backhand.\nThey also shared one conspicuous flaw. The staple skill at the top of the men\u2019s tour is a consistent serve that earns low-effort points, because the returner struggles to put it back into play. For both players, the serve was a weakness that needed to be refined in the future; for the viewers, it was a boon to entertainment, because the points landed in neutral territory, where both players had to get creative to earn an advantage in the rally.\nTheir lack was our gain.\nTo lay out every intricacy of the match would require its own book. Every surface of it was embedded with little experiments, regrets, and triumphs. Alcaraz toyed with an unconventional wide position on serve, which opened up an even more extreme angle for him; Sinner began slinging those returns down-the-line. One such return won Sinner the second set and left Alcaraz standing motionless. Sinner won every single point in the third-set tiebreak and led early in the fourth set. But he also blew a match point on his own serve late in that set, when Alcaraz began to play the high-pressure rallies with more clarity.\nAdvertisement\nSinner led again early in the fifth set, only for Alcaraz to break back and high-five some courtside fans. He was developing a taste for crowd work; Sinner kept to himself. For both players there were discrete moments when victory seemed inevitable. But the win belonged solely to Alcaraz. The head-to-head had been leveled at 2-2.\nAfter the match, Sinner remembered the crosscourt backhand he\u2019d hit on match point, barely wide, thinking that if he\u2019d kept it inside the court, he could have advanced to the semifinal instead of Alcaraz. But he said he had to \u201ccancel\u201d these ruminations so as not to get fixated on past mistakes. Though he\u2019d lost, Sinner accomplished something\nmore abstract with this match. He killed off any illusion that Alcaraz would rule the next era of tennis alone. Sinner had been just one ball away from beating Alcaraz in three straight matches on three different surfaces in 2022. In the early days, when sample size is small, rivalries are mutable, and the narratives shapeshift with every match. Or even\nwith a single shot, missed by inches.\nWhile Sinner was hung up on one particular shot he\u2019d missed, Alcaraz was surely delighted by one particular shot he\u2019d made, a highlight wild enough to turn tennis agnostics into converts. He was returning serve. Sinner\u2019s serve yanked him out to the left corner of the court. Alcaraz blocked the ball back and recovered to the middle. From there, he had to guess where Sinner was going to strike next, and he started moving toward the right corner. But he\u2019d guessed wrong. Instead Sinner had put the ball clean down the center of the court, and Alcaraz was about to run past the ball. There was no solution for this puzzle.\nExcept, of course, the absurdist solution: leaping straight into the air, wrapping the racquet behind his torso, and flicking the ball back over the net. This wasn\u2019t just a desperation behind-the-back shot that barely burbled over the net; it was an aggressive passing shot that genuinely threatened Sinner. Alcaraz won the point. His coach (Juan Carlos) Ferrero shook his head and clapped, joining the rest of the crowd in a state of disbelief.\nMany matches that stretch to five sets are hailed as classics, but closer inspection reveals their lulls and impurities. The thrilling fifth-set tiebreak gets enshrined in popular memory, and everyone politely forgets the third-set dud. This one, though, was euphoric from first ball to last. It was a match so good that fellow pro Coco Gauff tweeted that she had an early morning plane to catch, but refused to sleep and miss any of it. At the end it was a five-hour-and-15 minute odyssey. For the second match in a row, Alcaraz was on court past two a.m., playing for a thinned-out audience of diehards who were allowed to clamber down to the money seats, rewarded for their patience with a better view of tennis\u2019s future.\nRueful on my sofa, I resolved never to miss another match between these two if I was within a 500-mile radius.\nExcerpted from Changeover: A Young Rivalry and a New Era of Men\u2019s Tennis.

      "text": "FLUSHING, N.Y. \u2014 Against the blue and green of the Billie Jean King Tennis Center courts, the yellow ball careening between two rackets stands out.\nThat\u2019s before you see the yellow balls up in the stands. They\u2019re still, but they\u2019re bigger.\nThursday morning on Court 7, a small but rapt crowd watched Diana Shnaider, the No. 18 seed from Russia who is having the kind of year that makes tennis fans take notice. She was taking apart the Dane, Clara Tauson, who in 2022 was roughly where Shnaider is now before a series of back and foot injuries stalled her progress.\nAdvertisement\nAt 2-4, 15-30, with Tauson serving, the judges in the seats to the side of the court, a little higher than the umpire\u2019s chair, had seen enough.\n\u201cTwo more rounds,\u201d one said. \u201cThen we can go down.\u201d\nThey meant points, but it\u2019s easy to make a mistake when you\u2019re just a kid clutching the most sought-after piece of merchandise at the U.S. Open. A jumbo-sized tennis ball, 11 inches big and emblazoned with the Wilson logo just like the smaller ones getting blasted and feathered between the white lines, is as essential here as a water bottle and a hat. It\u2019s a canvas for autographs from the protagonists, a souvenir of a day out. It has also turned into a fuzzy yellow harbinger of doom.\nWhen Coco Gauff stepped up to the line, down 3-5 to Emma Navarro in a deciding set, they surged forward once more. This time, ushers sent them back. The most foreboding omen at the U.S. Open does at least bow to some gentle crowd control, even though it was right on cue. Navarro broke Gauff to take the set 6-3, and win the match.\nSigning autographs after a match is one of the sacred obligations a tennis player commits to when they step onto a tournament court. Swerving fans is not the done thing, even if the loser is usually granted the grace of a quick exit, especially in matches of greater magnitude. For the winner, balls are reached out over gangways and notepads are dangled down from steep banks.\nIt doesn\u2019t always go to script, as Novak Djokovic found out in painful fashion in Rome earlier this year. A keen spectator \u2014 not a kid, not clutching a ball \u2014 reached down to give the 24-time Grand Slam champion a high-five and instead inadvertently slipped a metal water bottle out of his rucksack and onto Djokovic\u2019s head. Djokovic went for medical attention, lost his next match in disoriented fashion, and then went for concussion tests in Belgrade.\nGO DEEPER\nDjokovic wears bike helmet to Italian Open after being struck by water bottle\nIn New York, no such worries. Backpacks are banned, as crowd controllers loudly and regularly remind the fans walking down the boardwalk from Mets-Willets Point subway station.\nAdvertisement\nThe same fans surge forward at the call of \u201cgame, set and match\u201d, no matter the occasion. Field court or stadium court, favorite player ever or one they didn\u2019t know existed until taking a seat to watch them play for their tennis life, the ritual is the same. Ball under the arm. Permanent marker in hand. The conciliatory handing over of $50 (almost \u00a338), and maybe some wheedling to an eventually obliging parent, happened earlier.\nThat ball, which costs $53.29 at the checkout at the Wilson shop, outmatching the $23 Honey Deuce cocktail as the canniest piece of inflation in Flushing, is made where the Wilson tennis balls on the courts are made. (The \u201cextra duty\u201d vs. \u201cregular duty\u201d debate between the men and women, which briefly went on hiatus in 2023 when both sides used the latter, is back for 2024.)\nThey look and feel like tennis balls, but they don\u2019t bounce like them, enabling a happy and newly minted customer to dribble them like a basketball on the way to the court. The Wilson balls have the cachet, but any brand can put a logo on a tennis ball. The streetwear mega-brand, Kith, has made one in collaboration with Wilson in the past. It was $23 cheaper online when it dropped than the U.S. Open ball is on-site, but it will fetch three figures, second-hand and unblemished.\nOrdinarily, the gathering of signatures takes place right at the end.\nBut this U.S. Open, busier than last year\u2019s, which was at that time the busiest in history, requires some forward planning. There are more people and more oversized tennis balls, but the same number of players on the court. So look up at any scoreboard that suggests one of them is not long for the tournament, and you are likely to see a gaggle of giant tennis balls slowly bobbing down steps. Tennis might sometimes turn on a single point, but the kids aren\u2019t interested in a comeback.\nAdvertisement\nLucia Bronzetti, the Italian who was an eyeful of clay from knocking Naomi Osaka out of the French Open, was in a bad spot Wednesday against Aryna Sabalenka. For most players, that bad spot is just being on a hard court with the Belarusian world No. 2, who is set to defend the Australian Open title for the second time in January. After her 6-3, 6-1 victory, she greeted a \u201cmini-me\u201d fan courtside, dressed in her outfit and carrying a little tiger toy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a motivation to keep going to inspire the young generation. That\u2019s the main goal. Yeah, that was a very adorable moment,\u201d Sabalenka said.\nYoung tennis fans clutching their souvenir, ready to meet their hero, is kind of cute too. Serving at 1-5 in the second set, Bronzetti more likely saw nothing but an eyeful of woven yellow, the Roman emperor\u2019s thumbs down to her imminent defeat.\nOut on Court 7, Tauson made them wait. A few pinging groundstrokes into the corners and Shnaider had to serve for the win. The match was on her racket, but the outcome was by no means certain. This was no deterrent to the deciders. \u201cWe can go down now,\u201d another said at the changeover, hustling along the bleachers.\nOne young girl gave Tauson a chance, staying perched higher up, gripping the ball tight.\nIt wasn\u2019t easy for Shnaider. After bringing up 30-0, Tauson leaned into a backhand to put her on her heels, before a double fault brought the game to 30-30. Still they waited.\nBy the time Shnaider was moving into the net at 40-30, the normal-sized tennis ball floating obligingly onto her racket ready to be put away, the big ones were behind her chair, in expectant hands.\n(Top photo: Sarah Stier / Getty Images)"

      "text": "ROLAND GARROS, PARIS \u2014 At the end of a match in Miami four years ago, Jannik Sinner and Alexander Bublik met at the net and had a short conversation. Sinner, 19 at the time, had just won a tight quarterfinal 7-6(5) 6-4, but he was astonished by the performance of his opponent. In just the fourth game, Bublik had edged forward to return a serve from halfway between the baseline and the service line, chipping a forehand at Sinner\u2019s feet and then flicking away a half-volley drop shot at the net.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou\u2019re not human,\u201d a laughing Sinner said.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Bublik replied. \u201cYou\u2019re not a human, man. You\u2019re 15 years old, playing like this.\u201d\nThe exchange \u2014 and match \u2014 encapsulated why Bublik, who will face the now-world No. 1 Sinner again in a French Open quarterfinal on Wednesday, is one of the most fascinating players on the ATP Tour.\nBublik, 27, is a proud nonconformist, a richly talented maverick from Kazakhstan who, on his day, can beat anyone, but who insists he will not sacrifice his health and his work-life balance to maximise his talents. Whether it\u2019s hitting shots with the handle of his racket in a final, smashing rackets, trying to throw a bottle up and getting it to land during a change-of-ends, chatting to spectators mid-match or serving a whole game of aces, Bublik is magnetic. He\u2019s also the king of the underarm serve, hitting six in a single game on more than one occasion.\nHe has been ranked as high as No. 17, but is currently No. 62 after losing motivation last year when he cracked the top 20 for the first time in May. He said a few years ago after beating former Roland Garros champion Stan Wawrinka in Monte Carlo, Monaco that: \u201cI hate clay, I hate this surface.\u201d And yet here he is, in his first Grand Slam quarterfinal on his least favourite surface.\nAfter bamboozling world No. 5 Jack Draper to reach the last eight, Bublik spoke about how he doesn\u2019t fit the mould of the modern, hyper-focused tennis player, a subject that he has discussed throughout the tournament.\n\u201cRight now, everybody is like robots, and they\u2019re just crazy, crazy performance guys,\u201d he said in a news conference prior to that match.\nSinner embodies that sentiment: someone who works phenomenally hard to maximise his talents. Someone whose biggest vice, according to a recent YouTube video, is driving golf karts quite fast around Melbourne Park or eating a burger after winning a Grand Slam.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m the guy you can see having a nice time down the street in Paris in the evening before the match,\u201d Bublik said. \u201cNot to go crazy, but I\u2019m social. I can skip the practice if I don\u2019t feel like it.\n\u201cIn my opinion, I\u2019m super normal, and they make me feel different.\u201d\nBublik\u2019s musings pose a fundamental question. Who is normal in elite tennis: a player like Bublik, or a player who sacrifices every part of their life for the sake of reducing the number that comes after their name?\n\u201cI prioritize tennis and the life in equal ways,\u201d Bublik said after beating Draper on Monday.\n\u201cSo, for me, it\u2019s a 50-50 relationship. If I can\u2019t walk at the age of 40, it\u2019s OK? No, it\u2019s not.\n\u201cI prioritize health and my lifestyle, because I have a family and I\u2019m a father (Bublik has a two-year-old son, Wassily), and I have to do the father duties.\u201d\nBublik insists that he does work hard, but not heedlessly. If he wants to miss a practice, he will. His style of tennis makes it easier for him to do that than most, because as with other mercurial players on the tour like Nick Kyrgios, he is blessed with skills that practice can groove but not create.\nLike most crafty players, he has incredible hands and an innate understanding of how points work and how to turn them upside down. Unlike most crafty players, he also has a 140mph serve, liquid power on his forehand and backhand and a large wingspan at 6 feet 5 inches tall. He doesn\u2019t have to work as hard as his peers to be a top-50 player.\nHe is also quite calculated and knows how much he needs to do to stay at that kind of level. It was his dropping to No. 80 in March this year that prompted him to apply himself on the clay, having had a wretched record on it for most of his career. He has interests outside of tennis, like investments in real estate and a curiosity about cryptocurrency. He is a reader.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe\u2019s very bright and quite worldly,\u201d said a staff member \u2014 speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships \u2014 who worked with him on the Ultimate Tennis Showdown exhibition circuit.\n\u201cI think that can come across as a little cynical but my impression is that actually he\u2019s just experienced and smart enough to understand how things work.\u201d\nBublik\u2019s claims about his work ethic at the French Open have also exposed something fundamental about the expectations fans and players have about normality in elite sport. In any other walk of life, work-life balance is held up as essential. If a friend or family member were doing nothing but pushing themselves relentlessly in their job, at the expense of everything else, people would be expected to check that they were OK.\nIn sport, it\u2019s the opposite. Utter dedication to a chosen craft is fetishized. The hours spent refining the forehand, or the swing, or the shot. The Olympic rower who woke up at 3 a.m. every day for four years in pursuit of a bronze medal. Doing otherwise is framed as a waste of talent.\nBublik does not deem this normal.\n\u201cIf you want to sleep, you just sleep,\u201d he said in a news conference at Roland Garros.\n\u201cI mean, we are top athletes. Someone made like 100 million, 25 titles, and he still wants to go for more. For me, that\u2019s not normal, in my opinion. But they make me feel like this.\n\u201cNowadays sport makes me feel like this, that I\u2019m different, which I don\u2019t believe so because I think I\u2019m just normal guy that was playing tennis and made it.\u201d\nBublik\u2019s long-time agent and manager Corrado Tschabuschnig, who started working with him at 17, gave a window into his psyche during an interview at Roland Garros on Tuesday.\n\u201cIf a player arrives late because he has a delay and he sleeps just five hours instead of eight hours, often he feels he cannot perform the next day because mentally he\u2019s completely destroyed,\u201d Tschabuschnig said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAlex can sleep one hour and he goes to the court and he says, \u2018Let\u2019s see what happens. If I\u2019m tired, I just tank a set and sleep and then I play the third one.\u2019\n\u201cHe\u2019s less bound to circumstances around him that he cannot control.\u201d\nSomething striking about Bublik\u2019s run at the French Open has been his speed of play between points. When he is losing, it looks like he wants out, but when he is winning, opponents get sucked into a vortex of aces and drop shots. Tschabuschnig said that Bublik is now serving and playing with such speed because he wants to win, not just because he wants to get off the court quickly.\nHe has constantly changed his goals, from getting to the top 50 to the top 20, to winning an ATP 500 title, to beating a top-10 player. All of which he\u2019s done \u2014 but without compromising on who he is.\n\u201cHe was not very keen on authority and discipline when we first met and he was not going to be the person who follows instructions,\u201d Tschabuschnig said.\n\u201cIt was clear that he was going to be one of those players that needed to fall and stand up, that you could not prevent from falling. But you can advise him what to do in case he doesn\u2019t want to fall the second time.\u201d\nBublik has made some concessions as he seeks to rebuild his ranking, playing fewer of his most ludicrous trick shots \u2014 the underarm tweener serve, the shots with the racket handle, the dummied smash that turns into a drop shot \u2014 but he showed no mercy in scrambling Draper\u2019s brain with his variety.\n\u201cI don\u2019t play many matches where I feel like it\u2019s almost out of my control what\u2019s going on, and he made that happen today,\u201d said Draper after the match. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\nTschabuschnig said that Bublik\u2019s apparently random approach is actually entirely planned. \u201cHe has no other option than to hit winners, to play with risk, to play drop shots and to come to the net \u2026 But it doesn\u2019t mean that you do it because you don\u2019t care. You do it, because you think that\u2019s the way to win.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBecause if he practices well for six months, he\u2019s going to face a Medvedev who practised well for 11 years. So what are we going to tell him? Or a Sinner who\u2019s practiced for 15 years.\u201d\nIn a scintillating return game that decided the fourth set and ultimately the match against the Brit, Bublik broke to love with a backhand winner, a forehand passing shot, a drop shot winner and a service return winner. He also looked at his box and gave them a wink in the third set, when a clearly frazzled Draper hit a double fault.\n\u201cHe loves to get in his opponent\u2019s head,\u201d Tschabuschnig said. \u201cAnd when he\u2019s in there, he doesn\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like he\u2019s got a drill in there.\u201d\nBublik is plenty relatable for someone whose tennis talents are so otherworldly. He likes to wake up at 9 or 10 a.m. and finds early starts hard. During his five-set win against the ultra-professional No. 9 seed Alex de Minaur in the second round, his mind wandered to the logistics of getting home when he was two sets down.\nHis turning point for his change in attitude this year wasn\u2019t a great training block or match, but a blowout in Las Vegas with his coach.\nHe can be a difficult customer, too. His racket smashes and propensity to give up in difficult circumstances can put people off, while he can be brusque off the court, giving little truck to questions or topics that he doesn\u2019t view as interesting. When asked by this reporter in a one-on-one interview to talk about his underarm serves, Bublik was unimpressed.\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a big deal \u2014 it\u2019s just a stupid shot that gives a player an advantage,\u201d he said.\nHe is also open about his bewilderment at how tennis has changed. During a defeat to rising teenager Jakub Men\u0161\u00edk earlier this year, Bublik bemoaned the concentration of talent that is moving down the tennis ladder.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cRemember when tennis was easy, eh?\u201d he said to umpire Mohamed Lahyani.\n\u201cLike five years ago, it was super easy to play tennis, huh? Yeah, bunch of random people in the top 50, barely moving.\u201d Pointing to Men\u0161\u00edk, he expressed his disbelief at the Czech not being a top-five player. But his peers hold his style and recent exploits in high regard.\nAryna Sabalenka, the women\u2019s world No. 1, said on Tuesday of Bublik\u2019s performance against Draper: \u201cThat was crazy. If he would play the way he played against Draper every time he\u2019s out there, I think he would be in the top 10.\u201d\nTommy Paul, the American world No. 12, said in a news conference at Wimbledon last year that Bublik\u2019s huge power on serve, coupled with the fact that he can chuck in an underarm one at any moment, means that when he is serving \u201cyou have to keep your eyes on him at all times. You actually cannot take your eyes off of him.\u201d\nBublik\u2019s team believe he has the talent to win a Grand Slam, and could one day win Wimbledon on the grass where his game is best suited. He won his only 500-level title, two levels below the Grand Slams, on grass at the Halle Open in Germany two years ago.\nFor now though, the focus is absolutely on the clay, a surface Bublik previously detested. He\u2019s loved at Roland Garros, helped by speaking decent French. During an emotional post-match speech after beating Draper, in which Bublik described the win as the best moment of his life, he was given the kind of loud and heartfelt ovation that is generally reserved for home players.\nIn the interview room, Bublik then insisted that the experience won\u2019t change his approach. \u201cThe good thing about this question is you mentioned that you \u2018might get,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\u201cWill I put my life and health on the line to have a \u201cmight\u201d? A maybe? No.\u201d\nAgainst Sinner, a December conversation with Ga\u00ebl Monfils, another mercurial talent, may feel pertinent.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI was complaining. I was losing. I was on a losing streak,\u201d Bublik explained Saturday. I said, \u2018Ga\u00ebl, it was so easy. (But now) everyone is playing so good.\u2019\n\u201cGa\u00ebl said: \u2018You wait for your chances. You have your chances, you use it. If you waste it, it\u2019s your problem.\u2019\u201d\nEven if Bublik does waste his chance against Sinner, it won\u2019t be the end of his world.\n(Top photo: Andy Cheung / Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage from Day 6 of the 2025 U.S. Open.\nFLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. \u2014 To adapt the old saw about people going broke, Taylor Townsend\u2019s rise to fame was fast, and then it was slow. At this summer\u2019s U.S. Open, it has happened all at once.\nAt 29, Townsend has become what a lot of people in tennis thought she would be when she was a teenager: A big-time figure in her sport and one of the most talked-about athletes in America. Far fewer people thought it would happen like this for the American, a lefty with a dangerous combination of touch and power when she has both working at the same time.\nAdvertisement\nAlmost no one.\n\u201cI truly believe that everyone has their own path,\u201d Townsend, the No. 1 doubles player in the world, said earlier this week. That was two days before the explosion on Court 11 at the end of her win over Jelena Ostapenko, which took her into the third round of the singles at the U.S. Open for the first time since 2019.\n\u201cTennis is one of the sports where a lot of the players and even the people around it are cursed with comparison, and everyone looks at their counterparts and what everybody else is doing and compares your journey to theirs.\u201d\nShe talked about having fallen into that trap, of wondering why she didn\u2019t become overnight the thing that everyone told her she would. Then she recalled being a little kid, learning the sport in Chicago and then Atlanta, and writing down her goals.\n\u201cI said that I wanted to create and have a legacy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nTownsend, whose image has been on just every sports and news highlight show since about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday evening, has been doing it for some time.\nShe grew up on public courts in the South Side of Chicago, before moving to Atlanta to stay with a tennis program run by Donald and Ilona Young, the parents of former junior No. 1 Donald Young. In 2012, she won the junior singles competition at the Australian Open and the junior doubles at Wimbledon, on her way to becoming the world No. 1 junior at 16. She was the shining star of the revamped development program at the United States Tennis Association (USTA), which Patrick McEnroe and Jose Higueras launched in 2008.\nAhead of the 2012 U.S. Open, the USTA declined to give Townsend a wild card into either the main draw or the qualifying tournament, following a disagreement with Townsend\u2019s family over whether she was fit enough to play. Townsend\u2019s mother, Sheila, a former college tennis player, told The Wall Street Journal that the family perceived the decision as an attack on Townsend\u2019s physique. In an essay for the Players\u2019 Tribune, published in 2021, Townsend said that she had anemia at the time of the decision, which had an effect on her fitness.\nAdvertisement\nIn a statement issued during the tournament thirteen years ago, McEnroe spoke only in general terms.\n\u201cOur concern is her long-term health, number one, and her long-term development as a player. We have one goal in mind: For her to be playing in [Arthur Ashe Stadium] in the main draw and competing for major titles when it\u2019s time. That\u2019s how we make every decision, based on that.\u201d\nThe controversy put Townsend at the center of a growing discussion about female athletes and their bodies at an age when no person would want their body placed under a microscope.\nIn the ensuing years, Townsend struggled to figure out what kind of tennis player she was as she tried to fulfil the promise of her junior career. She became a mother at 24, worked as a television analyst during her maternity leave, then began a climb back with one simple goal: trying to become better than the player she was before she gave birth to her son, Adyn Aubrey.\nLast year, she rose to a career high No. 47 in the singles rankings. This summer, she became the world No. 1 in doubles, after winning the 2024 Wimbledon and 2025 Australian Open women\u2019s titles with Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1. Her success, and the way in which she has achieved it on and off the court, has turned her into a crowd favorite and a kind of tennis folk hero, especially in the U.S.\nFans flock to her match to see those deadly angled volleys and a thumping serve and forehand, but also the Townsend vibes: the fist-pumps, the head nods, the roars and waving arms after big shots, that dovetail with the care and attention for those in her orbit.\n\u201cThe best,\u201d No. 31 seed Leylah Fernandez said of the experience of playing with Townsend, describing it as a tonic for the soul. They reached the 2023 French Open final, with Townsend pumping up her devastated Canadian partner after a defeat to Hsieh Su-wei and Wang Xinyu.\nAdvertisement\nAll of this, it turns out, was a prelude for this year\u2019s U.S. Open, where she teamed up with Ben Shelton to form the crowd\u2019s favorite team in the mixed doubles last week. They fell in the second round, and Townsend quickly pivoted to the singles and women\u2019s doubles, becoming one of just a handful of players to play all three events.\nShe took the court for the singles in a black dress she designed for own clothing line, the rim of the skirt lined with flames, and won her first-round match against Antonia Ru\u017ei\u0107 of Croatia.\n\u201cI\u2019m an Aries, so I\u2019m a fire sign,\u201d she said after the straight-sets win. I wore fire today.\u201d\nShe was wearing it again in her second-round duel with Ostapenko, the occasionally lethal but often erratic Latvian.\nOstapenko surged to an early lead but soon came back to earth, as Townsend got her teeth and the crowd into the match. Late in the first set Townsend fired a forehand that ticked the net. Ostapenko chased after it and nudged the ball back. Townsend volleyed a lob into the open court.\nTownsend, who said she was shocked the ball went over, accepted her good fortune and rode the momentum into the next point and on to a 7-5, 6-1 victory. At the net, during the post-match handshake, Ostapenko unleashed on her for not apologizing for the net cord. The 2017 French Open champion appeared to tell Townsend, who is Black, that she has \u201cno education.\u201d\nTownsend went right back at Ostapenko, pointing at her and circling her arm as she left the court, urging the crowd to lay it on thick. They obliged.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst things you can say to a Black tennis player in a majority White sport,\u201d two-time U.S. Open champion Naomi Osaka said Thursday of the incident. \u201cI know Taylor and I know how hard she\u2019s worked and I know how smart she is, so she\u2019s the furthest thing from uneducated or anything like that.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think it\u2019s ill-timing and the worst person you could have ever said it to,\u201d Osaka added. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if she knows the history of it in America.\u201d\nOstapenko, who left the Billie Jean King Tennis Center immediately after her match with Townsend, declined to speak Thursday after a loss in the women\u2019s doubles, citing medical issues in a message circulated by the USTA.\nLess than an hour after the end of the match, knowing everything she was about to say would be scrutinized and dissected by more people than ever before, Townsend said that she had heard and experienced stuff like this before. She recalled a doubles match at a lower-tier tournament in Virginia with no ball kids. An opponent kept smacking balls onto the neighboring courts, Townsend said, forcing her to schlep between points to fetch them. She and her partner, Asia Muhammad, won, and Townsend had words with her opponent after.\n\u201cI\u2019m just not going to tolerate disrespect, you\u2019re not going to disrespect me in my face,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer and I\u2019m the type of person where if you have something to say, you feel some type of way, you say it to my face, and we can talk about it, we can hash it out. It is what it is, but I stand strong and I stand firm in who I am. I don\u2019t back down from confrontation.\u201d\nShe said she watches sports because they reveal personalities, showing how people act in pressure situations.\nShe hadn\u2019t gotten any form of an apology from Ostapenko, who accused Townsend of violating tennis rules. Townsend said she didn\u2019t much care what Ostapenko had to say or what her motives were, only that the Latvian would have to speak for whether or not her comments carried racial undertones. Then she went on court with Siniakov\u00e1 the next day and won her first doubles match. She plays Mirra Andreeva, the No. 5 seed, Friday night last on Arthur Ashe Stadium. About 24,000 people should be there to roar her forward, some who have known her for a long time, and some for a little.\nAdvertisement\nTownsend had already spent plenty of years listening to what others had to say about her, measuring herself against the accomplishments and behavior of others. She was and is done with that, focusing on herself and on behaving in a way that will make her son proud one day when he learns about all this.\n\u201cI know that I\u2019m a fantastic tennis player, and I know that I have a lot of things that I want to accomplish, and this is another stepping stone,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another brick that I\u2019m laying on my foundation or on my road to greatness.\u201d\n(Top photo: Frank Franklin II / Associated Press)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of Day 2 of the 2025 U.S. Open.\nNEW YORK \u2014 There was bedlam at the U.S. Open Sunday night, when Daniil Medvedev\u2019s 6-3, 7-5, 6-7(5), 0-6, 6-4 defeat to Benjamin Bonzi was delayed for six minutes after a photographer prematurely entered the court.\nFrance\u2019s Bonzi was up match point against former world No. 1 and U.S. Open champion Medvedev on Louis Armstrong Stadium, leading 6-3, 7-5, 5-4, when he missed a first serve. At this point, a photographer walked onto the court thinking the match was about to finish. Because of the delay caused by him coming onto the court, umpire Greg Allensworth ruled that Bonzi should have a first serve back, rather than having to hit a second serve.\nAdvertisement\nThe USTA later told The Athletic that the photographer had had his credential for the tournament revoked after being escorted from the court by security.\nMedvedev, always a volatile player who knows how to work a crowd, berated Allensworth and demanded the crowd to make some noise and show their displeasure.\nAfter claiming that Allensworth \u201cwanted to leave\u201d because he gets \u201cpaid by the match, not by the hour,\u201d he shouted toward the camera: \u201cReilly Opelka was right!\u201d and \u201cWhat did Reilly Opelka say?\u201d\nThis was in apparent reference to the American player saying in February that: \u201cThe guy (Allensworth) shouldn\u2019t have a job or should be sidelined for about four weeks, maybe learn a thing or two,\u201d after he penalized Opelka for swearing at a spectator at the Dallas Open.\nINSANE scenes in the Medvedev & Bonzi match at US Open\nA cameraman was trying to leave after Bonzi missed his 1st serve.\nThe umpire gave Bonzi a 1st serve.\nDaniil: \u201cAre you a man? Are you a man? why are you shaking? What\u2019s wrong huh? Guys he wants to leave. He gets paid by\u2026 pic.twitter.com/nzlqgoWxre\n\u2014 The Tennis Letter (@TheTennisLetter) August 25, 2025\nWith the noise deafening, Bonzi waited before serving. Amid chants of \u201csecond serve,\u201d Allensworth tried and failed to quieten the crowd, with Bonzi asking why Medvedev did not receive a time violation for inciting the commotion.\nMedvedev, relishing playing the villain, even blew kisses in Allensworth\u2019s direction.\n\u201cThey did the work. I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Medvedev said in his news conference. \u201cThe crowd did what they did without me asking them too much, and it was fun to witness.\u201d\n\u201cDaniil started it. He put oil on the fire,\u201d Bonzi said in his news conference.\nEventually, after a six-minute delay, Bonzi did serve, missing it, before sending a backhand into the net after a nervy second serve. Medvedev won the next two points and broke to rescue the match, sending the crowd into a frenzy. He then claimed the set in a tiebreak, resurrected after the most unlikely of delays.\nAdvertisement\nMedvedev made a heart sign to the crowd after pinching the set, and it looked as though Bonzi wouldn\u2019t recover from the crushing disappointment of losing his lead in such strange circumstances. He called on the trainer midway through the fourth set and ended up losing it 6-0, before being broken immediately at the start of the fifth.\nBonzi broke back immediately and had to do so again after losing his serve at 2-2, before fending off five break points to hold for 4-3. There was still plenty of drama to come, when Medvedev, serving down 5-4, started to suffer badly from hand cramps. He was struggling to serve and had to vigorously shake his hand out between points. This prompted his fans in the crowd to do the same, in homage to a man who for many years has been the great antihero of the U.S. Open. At deuce, Medvedev was finally given a time violation, and then sent a backhand long to fall down match point about an hour and a half after Bonzi had first earned one.\nThere was to be no reprieve this time, as a sprawling Medvedev couldn\u2019t control a Bonzi backhand passing shot. After nearly four hours of barely believable drama, the Frenchman was through.\nA furious Medvedev sat on his chair after shaking his opponent\u2019s hand and absolutely obliterated a racket. It was his third straight first-round exit at a Grand Slam, and means he\u2019ll end the year with just one match win at the majors. His ranking will fall further from No. 13 as the quarterfinal points he won last year drop off. Medvedev was so furious that he didn\u2019t exit the stage until midway through Bonzi\u2019s on-court interview.\nMeanwhile a disbelieving Bonzi said that he had \u201cno idea\u201d how he had won the match.\n\u201cIt was crazy. I maybe got some new fans but also some non-fans. It was wild. A crazy scenario.\u201d\nHe added that he had \u201cnever experienced something like that. It was so difficult to play. So noisy, during points, between the points. I tried to stay calm, and at the end I gave all I had.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBonzi will next take on America\u2019s Marcos Giron in the second round on Wednesday.\nAs for Medvedev, it\u2019s tough to know where he goes from here. In a year of chastening defeats, this was another one to add to the collection. His title win here in 2021, and two final defeats in 2019 and 2023, all feel like an awfully long time ago.\n\u201cI\u2019m playing bad and in important moments, even worse. Everything. Everything. Serve, return, volley, whatever. Just need to play better, and I\u2019m going to try to do it next year,\u201d he said.\n(Photo: Elsa / Getty Images)"

      "text": "FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. \u2014 Everything changed in a heartbeat. One minute, Ben Shelton had the Louis Armstrong Stadium crowd doing its best to blow the roof off, as few players can. The next, he was out of the U.S. Open with a left shoulder injury, his immediate tennis future up in the air.\nAfter nearly two and a half hours of struggle, he had finally taken a two sets-to-one lead over a nemesis: Adrian Mannarino of France. But then he was grabbing at his shoulder, struggling to turn over a forehand, and soon telling his father and coach, Bryan, that he was experiencing some of the worst pain he\u2019d ever felt on a tennis court.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll play through anything and just kind of find a way,\u201d a sad and downcast Shelton said when it was over. \u201cWhether it\u2019s sickness or injury, like, if I can stay out there, I can stay out there. I never felt anything like this before.\u201d\nThe No. 6 seed and biggest star in American men\u2019s tennis had to retire from his third-round match with the score level at 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 4-6. It came after over three hours of maddening, chess-like tennis, that flummoxed Shelton first mentally and then physically.\nAfter a hard-fought third set, which Shelton won with a scarcely believable diving get from the back wall of Louis Armstrong Stadium, he grabbed his left shoulder when serving to win the first game of the fourth. On the second point of the next game, he grabbed it again and grimaced mid-point, after he whipped a forehand return.\nHe played one more point, slamming a desperate forehand into the net, and then walked over to his chair, telling the umpire he needed a medical timeout. He received treatment from a physio for four minutes and returned to the court, but he was a shadow of himself, bunting and chipping balls back, and unable to extend his arm on forehands and turn over his racket to spin the ball.\nServing again at 1-1, he tried a different strategy, cracking two aces which had the 37-year-old Mannarino laughing as they whizzed past him. But by 2-2, he was grabbing at the shoulder again, even as he won points. He received further treatment and changed strategy again, figuring out that rushing to the net and slicing made Mannarino rush his next shot. He kept making good choices and kept grabbing his shoulder, as the grimaces came in intervals. After Shelton had saved set points with gutsy forehand blasts and serve-and-volley tactics, he clasped at his left side one more time as Mannarino served out the fourth set.\nAdvertisement\nAt the changeover between the fourth and fifth sets, Shelton sat at the side of the court in tears, with a resigned look on his face. His father and coach, Bryan Shelton, gave him the sign he had to quit. The U.S. Open is Shelton\u2019s biggest stage and the site of his announcement to the tennis world. He could not risk it becoming the place that his career \u2014 or his potential as a top, major-winning player \u2014 ended in a gallant defeat.\n\u201cHe probably would have won that match,\u201d Mannarino said when it was over.\nShelton said he had entered the match healthy, and there was no early diagnosis on what went wrong. The on-court trainer didn\u2019t suggest anything. More examinations await.\n\u201cThe shoulder is obviously complex,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to know. Was basically just trying to alleviate pain and see if I could play, and that was the extent of it.\u201d\nWhile it might seem strange to give a player credit for a victory when his opponent retires because of an injury, this was something of a technical knockout for Mannarino, who subjected Shelton to his unique form of tennis torture for most of the afternoon, even when Shelton was finding a way into the lead.\nMannarino is the world No. 77 after a dismal run of form between last September and the start of this year\u2019s Wimbledon, but when his strange mix of anticipation, angles, spin and flat, bunt strokes is working, he can be an extremely difficult puzzle to solve. Especially for a player like Shelton, who loves to play straight-ahead, power tennis. May the best athlete win.\nMannarino does not engage with that. But he still figured Shelton would prevail, given their recent meeting in Canada.\n\u201cI know he doesn\u2019t especially like to play against me, but when we\u2019ve played each other in Toronto, he was really playing well and better than me, so It felt like he found solutions,\u201d Mannarino said in his news conference. So today I\u2019ve tried to change a few things in my game and I was able to give him a little bit of troubles, but still he was leading the score when he got injured, so yeah, it felt like even if I\u2019m giving a little trouble to him, he\u2019s still a better player than me at the end of the day.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThat has often meant little to Mannarino throughout his career.\nHe uses his experience to anticipate better than most, taking little, subtle steps that barely translate into visible movement which let him take the ball on the rise, so early that it sometimes looks as if he is hitting a shot before it has crossed the net.\nHe strings his racket so loosely that it behaves like a trampoline, so he does not have to swing very hard to generate power. As long as he gets his feet in position, he can take even the hardest ball early, on the short hop even, and block it back with pace and at a dangerous angle.\nEven a 135 mph serve, or a 90 mph forehand down the line, because he\u2019s seen so many of those that he can read where they are going before the opponent swings.\nIt\u2019s tennis Aikido. Use an opponent\u2019s power against them. The harder they hit, the less time they have to ready themself for the next shot.\nShelton went through that psychological washing machine in the second set, as Mannarino got himself back into the match. So then he tried to play with a little less pace, in an attempt to take away Mannarino\u2019s strength. But playing that way means playing on Mannarino\u2019s terms, and in a contest of off-speed junkballing, pushing and spins, he is not going to lose to anyone. Just when he appears to have pattycaked an opponent to death, he whips out a flatter-than-flat forehand that scuds through the court. The racket strung like a trampoline helps with that.\nSo then it\u2019s back to Plan A for a player like Shelton \u2014 just harder, faster and with more risk. Harder and faster shots mean harder and faster swings, more misses and longer games, swinging the shoulder over and over to generate more and more pace off a ball that at times appears to be moving in slow motion. And then he\u2019s missing, and then the match is stretching on and on, and the thought that goes back to Melbourne 19 months ago creeps into Shelton\u2019s mind: Is he really going to lose to this guy, at a major, again?\nAdvertisement\nShelton led Mannarino 2-1 at the 2024 Australian Open, before the Frenchman scrambled his tennis brain. This time, he scrambled his body, even while it looked like Shelton might escape with a win. He found his way to two set points in the third, sending yet another forehand long on the first of them. But on the second, with Mannarino joysticking him across the baseline, Shelton dived at a forehand in the corner and lofted a lob into the sideline near the back of the court. Mannarino could have taken the ball out of the air, but in a rare lapse of concentration, he didn\u2019t.\nSwinging his racket with the ball almost behind him, Mannarino could only pat a backhand into the net. Shelton dropped his racket and waved his finger in the air as the crowd erupted. He turned to the stands and yelled, \u201cI can do this,\u201d over and over. He beat on his chest.\nIt\u2019s possible Mannarino, a sort of French existentialist\u2019s idea of a tennis player, has never done any of these things on a tennis court. He already did his talking with the first two hours of guile and puppeteering. The packed crowd, roaring on its young hero, just didn\u2019t know it yet.\nAs soon as Shelton first grabbed his shoulder, the match felt over, even as he rolodexed his way through an array of strategies that mostly worked but could not kill the pain. By the time he was leaving the court to a standing ovation, tears flowing and with a towel over his head, Mannarino had found another way to confound a player and a crowd, and Shelton had made another good choice, though it was the most painful one of all.\nHe refused to feel sorry for himself in the aftermath.\n\u201cA small setback like this, yeah, it hurts,\u201d he said. \u201cI was playing really well, I was in form, a lot of confidence. Just so many things to be happy with the way that I was playing, moving on the court, competing.\nBut like I said, it\u2019s been a great summer, a lot of things to be thankful for. You won\u2019t hear me over here pouting about how bad things are with the summer that I\u2019ve had, the things that I\u2019ve been able to do in this sport in a short amount of time and the people I got around me.\u201d\n(Top photo: Angela Weiss / AFP via Getty Images)"

      "text": "May 5 2025: This story has been updated to reflect Jannik Sinner\u2019s return from his anti-doping ban at the Italian Open in Rome.\nJannik Sinner\u2019s doping case has been one of the biggest stories in tennis since shortly before the 2024 U.S. Open. On August 20 2024, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) \u2014 the worldwide anti-doping agency for the sport \u2014 announced that Sinner, the men\u2019s world No. 1, had twice tested positive for clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, in March of that year.\nAdvertisement\nIt also announced that an independent hearing, convened by the ITIA, had found Sinner bore \u201cno fault or negligence\u201d for those positive tests, accepting his explanation that he had been contaminated by a healing spray purchased by his physio, Umberto Ferrara. Sinner\u2019s physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi, used the spray on a cut on his hand and then subsequently gave Sinner a massage on his back and applied treatments to his feet.\nSinner parted company with Ferrara and Naldi, part of the team that took him to world No. 1, on the eve of the U.S. Open, which Sinner won against Taylor Fritz.\nJust over a month after the ITIA decision, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced that it would appeal the \u201cno fault or negligence\u201d ruling at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). WADA, which sits above the ITIA as the worldwide authority in sports doping is seeking \u201ca period of ineligibility of between one and two years,\u201d in which the two-time Grand Slam champion would be banned from playing tennis.\nA week later, CAS confirmed its receipt of WADA\u2019s appeal.\nThen, over three months later CAS set April 16 and 17 2025 as the date for the WADA appeal into Sinner\u2019s case.\nThat appeal was never heard. Sinner and WADA entered into a case resolution agreement, in which he received a three-month ban. The ban ran February 9 to May 4, meaning that he did not miss any of the four Grand Slam tournaments before returning to competitive tennis at his home event: the Italian Open, in Rome.\nGO DEEPER\nWorld No. 1 Jannik Sinner penalized after twice testing positive for banned substance\nWhen is Sinner\u2019s first competitive match after the ban?\nThe world No. 1 has been drawn in the top half of the Italian Open. As a seeded player, he receives a bye in the first round, so he will play his opening match May 10. His opponent will be Mariano Navone of Argentina or another Italian, Federico Cin\u00e0.\nWhat did Sinner say about his return to tennis?\nSpeaking at the Foro Italico in Rome ahead of the Italian Open, Sinner said that he was not scared of returning to competitive tennis, but that he would use the event to test his level.\nAdvertisement\nHe explained that he \u201cdid not want\u201d to accept the case resolution agreement from WADA, because he \u201cknew what really happened,\u201d but accepted that doing so negated the possibility of a worse outcome at any CAS hearing.\nWhen did WADA announce Sinner\u2019s ban?\nWADA confirmed that Sinner would be banned from tennis for three months the morning of Saturday Feb. 15.\n\u201cUnder the Code and by virtue of CAS precedent, an athlete bears responsibility for the entourage\u2019s negligence,\u201d it said, deeming a three-month suspension applicable to the \u201cunique set of facts in this case.\u201d\nWhich tennis tournaments did Sinner miss?\nSinner had entered the ATP 500 tournament in Doha, Qatar, which begins February 17. He missed that event, as well as the Sunshine Double: the two prestigious ATP Masters 1,000 events in Indian Wells, Calif., and Miami, Fla., in March.\nHe then missed two more ATP 1,000s \u2014 the Monte Carlo Masters and the Madrid Open \u2014 as well as the 500-level Bavarian Open, held in Munich, in between.\nHow did the ban affect his world No. 1 ranking?\nSinner already lost his ranking points from last year\u2019s Indian Wells event, as part of tennis anti-doping authorities\u2019 initial sanction for his two positive tests.\nHe lost 1,000 points from Miami, which he won in 2024; 400 from Monte Carlo and 200 from Madrid, where he reached the semifinals and quarterfinals respectively. He also dropped 500 points from not defending his title in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in February \u2014 but the decision to skip that event was not connected to his doping case.\nHis ranking points have dropped from 11,830 to 9,730, but nearest rivals Carlos Alcaraz or Alexander Zverev have not fully capitalized on his absence. Despite needing 2,500 points over the course of three months to overtake Sinner, Zverev, who only had 900 points to defend in that time, is 1,645 points behind Sinner as the Italian Open begins. The German won that tournament in 2024, so he needs to win it again just to maintain that gap. Sinner, who did not play the event last year, will gain points for every match that he wins in the Italian capital.\nAdvertisement\nAlcaraz, who was defending 1,000 points at Indian Wells, lost in the semifinals there. Despite winning the Monte Carlo Masters and reaching the final of the Barcelona Open, he also remains behind Sinner in the world rankings.\n| # | Player | Ranking Points | Minimum points after Italian Open | Projected ranking after Italian Open |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n1 | Jannik Sinner | 9,730 | 9,730 | 1 |\n2 | Alexander Zverev | 8,085 | 7,095 | 3 |\n3 | Carlos Alcaraz | 7,850 | 7,850 | 2 |\nWhat is a case resolution agreement?\nA case resolution agreement is part of the WADA World Anti-Doping Code, and can only be considered if an athlete admits to an anti-doping rule violation or violations. The mechanism, under Article 10.8.2, allows for cases to be completed if the athlete accepts \u201cConsequences\u201d acceptable to the anti-doping authority (in this case the ITIA) and to WADA for the violations admitted. The athlete does not have any say in what constitutes those consequences, but they are agreed between the athlete and the doping authorities.\nA WADA spokesperson said: \u201cThis provision 10.8.2 was introduced to the Code in 2021. Since then it has been used dozens of times for cases with exceptional circumstances such as this one.\n\u201cGiven there are many thousands of cases, it is not used that often and is the exception rather than the rule but there has been plenty of precedent for this. Ultimately in this case three months represents a fair outcome under the specific circumstances.\u201d The spokesperson described the exceptional circumstances as the \u201cfull body of facts and evidence\u201d in Sinner\u2019s case.\nWhen did Sinner test positive?\nBoth of Sinner\u2019s positive tests came in March 2024. The first was an in-competition test on March 10 at the BNP Paribas Open held in Indian Wells, California. The second was an out-of-competition test on March 18.\nWhat is clostebol?\nClostebol is an anabolic steroid. It is best known for its role in East Germany\u2019s state-sponsored doping programs of the 1970s and 1980s. It shortens recovery times following intense workouts and allows for the expedited production of muscle mass, in a similar manner to testosterone. Its potential legitimate uses have included treating muscle-wasting disease and osteoporosis. It\u2019s also an ingredient in certain healing creams and sprays that are readily available in Italy, though not in many other countries.\nSinner\u2019s test samples contained 86 picograms/litre on 10 March, and 76pg/litre on 18 March, when adjusted for the application of a normal specific gravity.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cEven if the administration had been intentional, the minute amounts likely to have been administered would not have had any relevant doping, or performance enhancing, effect upon the player,\u201d said Professor David Cowan, a member of the ITIA tribunal for its final ruling on the case.\nWhat did the ITIA charge Sinner with?\nThe ITIA charged Sinner with violating Article 2.1 and Article 2.2 of the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme (TADP). Those articles govern \u201cthe presence of a prohibited substance or any of its metabolites or markers in a player\u2019s sample,\u201d and \u201cuse or attempted use by a player of a prohibited substance or a prohibited method.\u201d\nBoth Articles are subject to Article 2.1.1, which states that it is \u201ceach player\u2019s personal duty to ensure that no prohibited substance enters their body.\u201d\nWhat explanation did Sinner give?\nSinner stated that his fitness coach, Umberto Ferrara, had brought an over-the-counter healing spray containing clostebol to Indian Wells (under the brand name Trofodermin, the spray is available over the counter in Italy). Sinner\u2019s physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi, cut his hand and then used the spray on that cut. Naldi then conducted massages on Sinner, which led to transdermal contamination with the clostebol from the healing spray.\nGO DEEPER\nJannik Sinner built the team that made him world No. 1. Then he blew it up\nWhat did the ITIA investigation find?\nThe ITIA\u2019s investigation concluded with an independent panel, overseen by arbitrator Sport Resolutions, on August 15. At that hearing, the panel ruled that Sinner bore \u201cno fault or negligence\u201d for the two violations of the (TADP), but nevertheless found him to have committed the two violations.\nThe tribunal accepted Sinner\u2019s version of events as outlined above and, as such, ruled that he should not be banned but should lose his prize money, results and ranking points from Indian Wells.\nWhat does \u2018no fault or negligence\u2019 actually mean?\nThat phrase is part of the ITIA\u2019s framework for assessing and prosecuting anti-doping violations and comes into consideration when a player has successfully shown that they did not intentionally dope.\nAdvertisement\nThe usual sanction for Sinner\u2019s violations, if proven that he intended to dope, would be a four-year ban. That drops to two years when a player can prove they did not intentionally dope.\n\u201cNo fault or negligence\u201d governs the possibility of reducing that two-year ban further, or to nothing, under Article 10.5 of the TADP.\nThe TADP requires that a player \u201cdid not know or suspect, and could not reasonably have known or suspected even with the exercise of utmost caution, that they had used or been administered the prohibited substance.\u201d\nOne level below this is \u201cno significant fault or negligence,\u201d which requires the player \u201cestablishing that their fault or negligence, when viewed in totality of the circumstances and taking into account the criteria for no fault or negligence, was not significant in relation to the anti-doping rule violation.\u201d\nThis is significant because the distinction is at the center of WADA\u2019s appeal against the initial ruling in Sinner\u2019s case.\nWhy was Sinner allowed to continue to play?\nAs soon as athletes test positive for a performance-enhancing drug that fits the criteria of what that anti-doping world refers to as an \u201cadverse analytical finding,\u201d they are subject to a provisional suspension while an investigation takes place.\nSinner received a provisional suspension following each positive test for clostebol. However, athletes have the right to appeal these provisional suspensions. Separate tribunals convened by the ITIA heard those appeals quickly and in each case accepted his explanation, which he was able to back up with testimony from his support team and receipts showing that his trainer had purchased the healing spray with clostebol in it.\nThose decisions allowed Sinner to keep playing while authorities pursued a full investigation. Under these circumstances, ITIA rules allow for the test results and the investigation to remain confidential until the final hearing adjudication. That occurred on August 15, after which the ITIA publicized the case.\nAdvertisement\nWhat has Sinner said about the case?\nDuring the U.S. Open, Sinner answered numerous questions about the positive tests and the process he has been through. He has replaced his trainer and physiotherapist. He spoke openly about how the case weighed on him the past six months and the relief the end of the process brought. After WADA announced that it was appealing the ruling to CAS, he released the following statement:\n\u201cI am disappointed to hear that WADA have chosen to appeal the result of my ITIA hearing after the independent judges had exonerated me and deemed me to be innocent.\n\u201cOver the past few months and throughout this process, there have been three separate hearings in each case confirming my innocence. Several months of interviews and investigations culminated in three senior judges scrutinizing every detail through a formal hearing. They issued an in-depth judgement explaining why they determined me not at fault, with clear evidence provided and my cooperation throughout.\n\u201cOn the back of such a robust process, both the ITIA and the Italian anti-doping authority accepted it and waived their rights to appeal. I understand these things need to be thoroughly investigated to maintain the integrity of the sport we all love.\n\u201cHowever, it is difficult to see what will be gained by asking a different set of three judges to look at the same facts and documentation all over again. This being said, I have nothing to hide, and as I have done throughout the summer, I will cooperate fully with the appeal process and provide whatever may be needed to prove my innocence once again.\u201d\nSpeaking at the 2025 Australian Open just before CAS confirmed the date for the appeal hearing \u2014 at which point Sinner did not know when it would be \u2014 he admitted that waiting to know when the appeal would happen had weighed on him.\n\u201cI would lie if I would tell you I forget,\u201d he said.\nWhat do other tennis players think about the case?\nPlayer reaction has run the gamut.\nNick Kyrgios, the outspoken Australian, said Sinner should have automatically been banned for two years. Others have questioned whether, as the world No. 1, Sinner received special treatment.\nAdvertisement\nIt can take months for players to have their appeals on their provisional suspensions heard. Sinner\u2019s appeals were heard and adjudicated within weeks, so quickly that he didn\u2019t have to miss any tournaments.\n\u201cDifferent rules for different players,\u201d Denis Shapovalov tweeted after news of the positive tests broke.\nShapovalov later told the website Tennis Majors that his comment wasn\u2019t directed at Sinner, but at an anti-doping process that has not given other players the same benefit of the doubt and quick attention that players saw the ITIA granting to Sinner. The British player Tara Moore, who was charged with an anti-doping violation later shown to be caused by contamination that took far longer to wind its way through, joined the chorus, as did her compatriot Liam Broady.\n\u201cWhether Sinner was doping or not, this is not right,\u201d Broady wrote on social media. \u201cPlenty of players go through the same thing and have to wait months or years for their innocence to be declared. Not a good look.\u201d\nThe Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) labelled the ITIA\u2019s processes as \u201cbroken\u201d in a letter sent to the body, as well as the ATP and WTA Tours and four Grand Slams.\nThe ITIA said that \u201cit is currently our belief that ITIA investigators work according to the rules, with respect and reflecting our values.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nTennis player association led by Novak Djokovic calls anti-doping processes 'broken' in letter\nThe ITIA and Sinner\u2019s team have said that Sinner\u2019s case was heard quickly because everyone knew immediately the source of the clostebol contamination and had the ability to back up their statements with the necessary hard evidence. That Sinner, as world No. 1, could mobilize more effective legal resources more quickly than another player in this situation is not in doubt, but the process by which he did so does not fall outside of normal ITIA protocol.\nIn its quarterly report into anti-doping and anti-corruption processes released October 17 2024, the ITIA said that \u201cthe case management process for anti-doping cases is complex, and we appreciate that it can be confusing to understand the differences in outcome, or perceived inconsistencies in the process.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe way we manage cases does not change, irrespective of the profile of the player involved. The way a case unfolds is determined by its unique circumstances, facts and science.\u201d\nWhy did WADA appeal?\nWADA sees things differently to the independent tribunal that settled on a verdict of \u201cno fault or negligence\u201d for the two violations.\n\u201cIt is WADA\u2019s view that the finding of \u2018no fault or negligence\u2019 was not correct under the applicable rules,\u201d it said in a statement on Saturday. As such, the organization is pushing for a ban of one or two years \u2014 though not a disqualification of any results, beyond Indian Wells as per the original verdict.\nThis shows that WADA, like the ITIA, accepts that Sinner did not intentionally dope. A one or two-year ban would result in a change in the final ruling from \u201cno fault or negligence\u201d to \u201cno significant fault or negligence,\u201d as outlined above.\nThis summer saw a bitter dispute between the U.S. and China over allegations surrounding doping by Chinese swimmers before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and suggestions from the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) that WADA had not been strong enough in enforcing its rules. WADA has rebutted these claims, but it would be understandable if the organization wished to show itself to be weighing in on Sinner\u2019s case.\nWADA retains the right to appeal any judgement by any anti-doping authority across the globe, as it has done here.\nGO DEEPER\nWhat is the WADA appeal of Jannik Sinner's doping case really about?\nWhat would have happened to Sinner if WADA\u2019s appeal had been successful?\nHe will not be able to compete in a professional tennis event for up to two years, depriving him of the chance to earn millions of dollars in prize money. A suspension would likely do significant damage to his reputation. Sinner is 23, so he would have time to prosper after the suspension, but it\u2019s hard to overestimate the damage that missing two prime years of his career would exact.\nAdvertisement\nWhat does this mean for tennis?\nWhichever way you cut it, this has not been a great look for tennis \u2014 the world\u2019s best male player being under investigation for doping offences. There will be some who follow tennis who will lose trust in what they are seeing. Likewise, there will be many who won\u2019t feel this is such a big deal given there\u2019s no real suggestion that the amount of clostebol Sinner had in his system would have given him much of a competitive advantage.\nBut the longer it drags on the more damage it will do to tennis, with everyone wanting a swift resolution to end all talks of asterisks and relitigation.\nThe resolution reached, however, in which Sinner is banned but during a period of the tennis calendar that does little harm to his fortunes at the top of the sport, will only reopen wounds of players who feel there are disparities in treatment, even though the process is in accordance with anti-doping regulations.\n(Top photo: Tim Clayton / Corbis via Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage from Day 6 of the 2025 U.S. Open.\nWelcome to the U.S. Open briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories on each day of the tournament.\nOn Day 4, Carlos Alcaraz vanquished bad memories, the city\u2019s tennis diasporas turned out and perhaps the best sports photo of the year came to the fore.\nCarlos Alcaraz vanquishes demons of last year\nA year on, Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s second-round U.S. Open loss to Botic van de Zandschulp looks like the most overindexed result in the sport.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same stage of this year\u2019s competition, Alcaraz posted a performance and result Wednesday night far more illustrative of who he is as a player. He destroyed Italy\u2019s Mattia Bellucci 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 to set up a third-round meeting with No. 32 seed Luciano Darderi, delivering a display at odds with the alleged flakiness and inconsistency with which the Van de Zandschulp match has become synonymous.\nIn reality, that defeat last year was an anomaly: the only time in 11 Grand Slams that Alcaraz has failed to reach the quarterfinals, against the backdrop of his mentally and physically exhausting defeat to Novak Djokovic in the Paris Olympics\u2019 gold-medal match three weeks earlier. Alcaraz\u2019s tennis can be volatile during matches, but he is now 31-1 in his last 32.\nAfter routing the world No. 65, he spoke of the impact of last year\u2019s upset on his tournament this year. He admitted that he had thought more about his shock exit to Van de Zandschulp than his U.S. Open title win in 2022, and added: \u201cI thought about last year when I stepped on the court. Some bad thoughts. I was nervous about it, like thinking: \u2018OK, I don\u2019t want to do the same thing as I did last year, losing in the second round.\u2019\n\u201cI wanted just to improve from the experience. I think when I lost in the second round last year, it was one of those moments when I learned a lot how to deal with some situations, how should I have done things much better. I think I\u2019ve just done it this year much, much better.\u201d\nThe confidence and energy that coursed through Alcaraz last night underlined how the win could not have been in starker contrast to that monumental, if overindexed, defeat a year ago.\nCharlie Eccleshare\nRising tennis stars bring their fans from all over New York City\nAfter three wins in the first round, three rising Southeast Asian tennis nations prepared to bring their support to the Billie Jean King Tennis Center from all over New York City once again.\nAdvertisement\nAnd while Wednesday did not extend the runs of Janice Tjen of Indonesia and Alex Eala of the Philippines, the diaspora populations concentrated in the city\u2019s nearby Elmhurst and Woodside neighborhoods respectively once again came out to support the players making history for their countries. Tjen lost handily to Emma Raducanu of Great Britain, who beat her 6-2, 6-1, jumping on anything remotely short and crowding Tjen on her backhand side to stop her from unleashing her heavy inside-out forehand. The 2021 U.S. Open champion was simply too much for Tjen, who upset No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermatova in the first round and has won 100 of her last 113 matches on the third tier of professional tennis. She\u2019s also the first Indonesian player to win a main-draw match at a Grand Slam since 2004.\nThen it was Eala\u2019s turn to carry the torch for the Philippines again, having made tennis history for her archipelago most of the past year. But she ran into Cristina Bus\u00e7a of Spain, who beat her 6-4, 6-3. Eala had some chances to draw even in the second set, but couldn\u2019t find enough consistency. Still, her win in the first round over the No. 14 seed Clara Tauson, a wild match decided by a third-set tiebreak that Eala won 13-11, made her the first Filipino player to win a Grand Slam match in the modern era of tennis, which goes back more than 50 years.\nColeman Wong of Hong Kong is last to go. A close friend of Eala\u2019s from the Rafael Nadal Academy in Mallorca, Spain, Wong plays Adam Walton of Australia Thursday, having beaten Aleks Kovacevic of the U.S. in the first round.\nMatt Futterman\nThe subject and snapper of the best photo in sports this year meet\nTennis photographs more beautifully than many sports. The athleticism, the ball on the strings, the back and forth of the players.\nBut one of the sports pictures of the year so far has nothing to do with any of that.\nAdvertisement\nNo. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini\u2019s first-round match against Destanee Aiava of Australia was a fairly straightforward win for the Italian, who last year made two Grand Slam finals and has held steady in the top 10 in 2025. But it produced a split-second alignment of player and racket so perfect that it defied belief. So perfect that capturing it was on the verge of improbable.\nStep forward, Ray Giubilo, who delivered a work of art:\nView this post on Instagram\nThe photo went around the internet. So much so that when Giubilo was sitting at the side of the court for Paolini\u2019s second-round match against talented American teenager Iva Jovi\u0107, there was only one thing to be done:\nJasmine Paolini embraces photographer Ray Giubilo after he captured a once-in-a-lifetime picture of her during her previous match. https://t.co/xnWYDr3554 pic.twitter.com/bdnNimEtSj\n\u2014 Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) August 28, 2025\nOther notable results on Day 4:\n- Novak Djokovic (7) recovered from losing the first set against American qualifier Zachary Svajda to win 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-3. 6-1. Svajda led 3-1 in the third set, but cramp derailed him as the match wore on.\n- Last year\u2019s finalist Jessica Pegula (4) continued her serene progress in the women\u2019s draw. She lost just four games for the second match in a row, beating Anna Blinkova of Russia 6-0, 6-4.\n- And Aryna Sabalenka (1) won yet another tiebreak, her 19th of 20 in 2025, in beating Polina Kudermetova 7-6(4), 6-2.\nShot of the day\nAlcaraz goes back to front on his way to victory:\nDrop shots\n\ud83e\udd1d At the handshake after their match, Jelena Ostapenko appeared to tell Taylor Townsend that she has \u201cno education.\u201d Townsend, who won the match 7-5, 6-1, discussed the altercation in her news conference.\n\ud83d\udcb0Daniil Medvedev was fined $42,500 for his behavior during his first-round defeat to Benjamin Bonzi, which included inciting the crowd and smashing his rackets.\n\ud83e\udd15Jack Draper, a semifinalist last year, has withdrawn from the U.S. Open with an elbow problem.\nUp next:\n\ud83c\udfbe Women\u2019s singles: Hailey Baptiste vs. Naomi Osaka (23)\n1:30 p.m. ET (estimated) on ESPN/ESPN+\nTwo of Osaka\u2019s four Grand Slam titles have come in New York, and she came into this year\u2019s U.S. Open on her best run of form since returning to tennis in January 2024, after giving birth to her first child. Baptiste will be a stern test of that form, with a similarly devastating serve to Osaka and the rally tolerance to test her off the ground.\n\ud83c\udfbe Men\u2019s singles: Jannik Sinner (1) vs. Alexei Popyrin\n1:30 p.m. ET (estimated) on ESPN/ESPN+\nThe defending men\u2019s champion faces a player who achieved the single greatest win of his career at this tournament 12 months ago. Sinner has looked irrepressible in the early rounds of Grand Slams this year, but Popyrin, who beat Djokovic in four astounding sets here in 2024, is a dangerous opponent.\nAdvertisement\n\ud83c\udfbe Women\u2019s singles: Donna Veki\u0107 vs. Coco Gauff (3)\n7 p.m. ET on ESPN/ESPN+\nGauff and her new serve needed her old foundations of athleticism and court coverage to get past Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107 in the first round. Veki\u0107, with a comparatively powerful serve and even stronger ground strokes, will pose a different challenge \u2014 she beat Gauff at the Olympics last year.\nU.S. Open men\u2019s draw 2025\nU.S. Open women\u2019s draw 2025\nTell us what you noticed on the fourth day\u2026\n(Top photo of Carlos Alcaraz: Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)"
