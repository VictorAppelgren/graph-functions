  "content": "LISA COOK'S HEARING ENDS WITH NO RULING. A JUDGE IN WASHINGTON GIVES LEGAL TEAMS ON BOTH SIDES MORE TIME TO MAKE THEIR CASE OVER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EFFORT TO FIRE THE FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR. WE WILL BRING YOU TO THE COURTHOUSE IN WASHINGTON FOR A LIVE REPORT FROM TYLER KENDALL WHERE THINGS JUST WRAPPED UP WITH INSIGHTS FROM MICHAEL AND NATASHA SERIN FROM THE YALE BUDGET LAB. OUR PANEL IS IN PLACE. JEANNE SHEEHAN ZAINO AND RICK DAVIS ARE WITH US. WE START ON WALL STREET. CHARLIE PELLETT HAS THE LATEST ON THE TRADE FROM WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. > > NOT JUST A FRIDAY TRADE, BUT PCE TRADE. ALL IN THE RED. TECH BEING HIT HARD. THE S & P DOWN 41. RETREATING FROM YESTERDAY'S RECORD AND FALLING BACK BELOW 6500. S & P DOWN BY .6%. DOW DOWN .30. NASDAQ DOWN 238 POINTS. NVIDIA REPORTED THIS WEEK DOWN ANOTHER 3.3%. 10 YEAR AT 4.22%.

CHARLIE PELLETT WILL HAVE MORE AS WE KEEP TABS ON THE TRADING ON THIS FRIDAY. WELCOME TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE WEEKEND AND THE FRIDAY EDITION OF BALANCE OF POWER. ALL EYES HAVE BEEN ON THE COURTHOUSE A COUPLE OF BLOCKS FROM WHERE I'M SITTING. CONSTITUTION MEETS PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. TYLER KENDALL HAS BEEN THERE SINCE BEFORE THE SUN CAME UP. THIS IS THE EMERGENCY HEARING FOR FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR LISA COOK AND THE PRESIDENT'S EFFORTS TO HAVE HER FIRED. THERE WAS A BIG ARGUMENT ABOUT CAUSE AND WHETHER THE PRESIDENT HAS THE AUTHORITY, WHETHER DUE PROCESS WILL BE INVOKED. BOTH SIDES LEFT WANTING. IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN THEY WILL BE BACK AS THE LEGAL TEAMS HAVE BEEN GIVEN MORE TIME TO PROVIDE MORE FILINGS. TYLER BRINGS US UP TO DATE AND PICKS UP THE STORY AT THE COURTHOUSE. > > THIS HEARING LASTED JUST UNDER TWO HOURS. WE SAW BOTH SIDES GET SOME TOUGH QUESTIONING FROM THE JUDGE DURING THIS HEARING. AS HER OUTLINE, THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT ISSUES IN PLAY. ONE WAS TODAY'S CASE WAS ABOUT COOK SEEKING THIS TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER WHICH WOULD REINSTATE HER INTO THE ROLE AS THE COURT PROCESS AROUND THE LARGER LEGAL QUESTIONS SURROUNDING HER FIRING ULTIMATELY PLAY OUT. THAT CONCLUDED WITH NO RULING. WE ARE NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING EARLIER THAN TUESDAY AS BOTH SIDES HAVE TIME TO FILE ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS RELATED TO THE CASE. AND WHILE TODAY'S RULING DID NOT REALLY HAVE TO DO WITH THE BROADER CASE, WE GOT A LOT OF INSIGHT INTO HOW BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO APPROACH THE LEGAL BATTLE. REALLY HITTING THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. THE CRUX HAS TO DO WITH DEFINING THE IDEA OF CAUSE. WE HEARD FROM LISA COOK'S LAWYERS THAT THE ALLEGATIONS OF MORTGAGE FRAUD DO NOT RISE TO THAT LEVEL OF CAUSE. POINTING OUT A FEW DIFFERENT REASONS THEY FEEL THAT WAY. INCLUDING THE ALLEGATIONS HAPPENED IN 2021 AND LISA COOK WAS NOT APPOINTED AS GOVERNOR UNTIL 2022. THEY ARE OUTSIDE OF HER REALM AS A FEDERAL RESERVE OFFICIAL. IN THE COURT FILING YESTERDAY, WE DID GET A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN INSIGHT INTO WHAT THEY ARE THINKING WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENSE SUGGESTING IF THERE WERE ANY DISCREPANCIES ON THESE MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS, PERHAPS IT IS A CLERICAL ERROR AND COOK DID NOT HAVE ANY INTENT TO DECEIVE ANYONE. I WILL MENTION ON THE ADMINISTRATION SIDE, THEY SAID IT IS UP TO THE COURTS TO ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO DEFINE THE STATURE OF WHAT QUALIFIES AS SUFFICIENT CAUSE. THEY PUSHED BACK ON THE NOTION LISA COOK WAS NOT GIVEN DUE PROCESS. POINTING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OWN SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS SAYING IT SHOULD QUALIFY AS THE NECESSARY TIME SHE COULD HAVE HAD TO RESPOND. JOE: WE HAVE A LOT TO COVER. UNCLEAR WHEN THEY WILL COME BACK. COULD IT BE AS SOON AS TUESDAY? > > THAT SEEMS TO BE OUR UNDERSTANDING. THE JUDGE INDICATED IT WOULD TAKE ADDITIONAL TIME TO WEED THROUGH WHAT IS HAPPENING. PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO -- THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO ACT TODAY. HE SAID THEY ARE EXPECTING THE FED TO ACT ONCE THIS IS RESOLVED IN THE COURTS, WHICH RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE NEEDS TO BE THIS TRO IN PLACE, IF IT CAN MOVE DIRECTLY TO AN INJUNCTION FOR THE LONGER DURATION OF THIS LEGAL BATTLE. STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS WE HAVE TO PARSE THROUGH. THERE IS NO RULING BUT WE GOT MORE INSIGHT INTO HOW THESE SIDES ARE APPROACHING THE BROADER LEADER -- A LEGAL CASE OF HER FIRING. JOE: MANY THANKS. A LONG ONE FOR TYLER KENDALL AT THE COURTHOUSE. MICHAEL MCKEE HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS FROM WORLD HEADQUARTERS. THE MAN WHO BRINGS YOU THE NEWS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE MEETINGS FROM LOCKUPS WHEN THE MINUTES ARE RELEASED. DO WE KNOW IF LISA COOK WILL BE GOING TO WORK? > > ON THE FED BASICALLY SAID THEY ARE NOT TAKING ACTION UNTIL THE CASE IS RESOLVED. WHAT RESOLVED MEANS, WE DON'T KNOW IF IT IS THE JUDGE ISSUING SOME SORT OF RESTRAINING ORDER OR INJUNCTION TO KEEP HER IN THE JOB OR WHETHER IT MEANS THEY WILL WAIT UNTIL WE SEE WHAT THE LEGAL CASE, HOW THAT IS RESOLVED. IT APPEARS SHE HAS BEEN WORKING FROM HOME, SHE CAN STILL CONTINUE TO WORK FROM HOME AS FAR AS THE FED IS CONCERNED. BEFORE THEY LEFT, THE JUDGE ASKED THE LAWYERS TO DISCUSS THE IDEA OF SKIPPING FROM THE TRO TO THE INJUNCTION. AND ABBY LOWELL, COOK'S LAWYER SAID THE ONE THING HE WOULD NOT DO WAS AGREE TO ANYTHING THAT DISRUPTED THE STATUS QUO, ANYTHING THAT PUSHED HER OUT OF THE JOB IN THE MEANTIME AND ALLOWED THE PRESIDENT TO PUT SOMEONE ELSE IN. JOE: INTERESTING. I DON'T KNOW IF WE LEARN VERY MUCH TODAY, WE ARE STILL CHEWING ON EXACTLY HOW TO DEFINE CAUSE. ONCE IT IS RESOLVED ON A LEGAL LEVEL, THAT COULD NEED SOME TIME BECAUSE IT WILL LIKELY GO TO THE SUPREME COURT. DOES JAY POWELL WEIGH IN AS THE CHAIR? WHEN DO WE HEAR FROM HIM? > > WE PROBABLY WON'T. EXCEPT FOR THE FACT HE'S GOT TO FACE THE PRESS AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 17 MEETING. THE FED IS IN THE UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION OF NOT BEING ABLE TO DEFEND LISA COOK BECAUSE IT IS A PRIVATE ISSUE OF HERS. IT IS NOT PART OF THE FED'S JOB. THEY CANNOT GET INVOLVED IN THAT. THEY HAVE A ROOTING INTEREST IN THE PRESIDENT NOT BEING ABLE TO REPLACE PEOPLE ON THE FED AT WILL. BUT THEY CANNOT SAY THAT EITHER. THEY ARE KIND OF SIDELINE FOR THE TIME BEING. THEY WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO MAKE THE CASE AN INDEPENDENT CENTRAL BANK PRODUCES BETTER ECONOMIC OUTCOMES FOR THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THEM. JOE: WHETHER WE GET A RULING ON TUESDAY OR NOT, WE KNOW WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT DATE ON THURSDAY WHEN STEPHEN MIRON SITS FOR HIS CONFIRMATION HEARING BEFORE THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE. WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING AT THIS POINT? I'M THINKING WE COULD HAVE MORE FIREWORKS THAN WE WOULD HAVE BEFORE. > > IT WILL BE FAIRLY EASY TO PERRY ANY QUESTIONS AROUND LISA COOK BECAUSE HE CAN SAY I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED MEETINGS EITHER. BUT DEMOCRATS CERTAINLY WILL PUSH HIM HARD ON THE THINGS HE HAS WRITTEN. HE CAME UP WITH THE MAR-A-LAGO ACCORD IDEA. HE ALSO WROTE A PAPER CALLING FOR SIGNIFICANT REFORMS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT. INCLUDING ALLOWING STATE GOVERNORS TO APPOINT THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF REGIONAL FED BANKS, WHICH WOULD PROBABLY ENABLE THEM TO CONTROL WHO IS APPOINTED AS A REGIONAL FED PRESIDENT. THAT WOULD MAKE THE FED MORE POLITICAL. YOU CAN IMAGINE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THEY WILL HAVE. I'M SURE THEY WILL ALSO SAY ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR HUGE RATE CUTS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT TOLD YOU TO? JOE: HOW WILL HE ANSWER THAT? > > I'M SURE HE WILL SAY NO, I HAVE LOTS OF VALID ECONOMIC REASONS FOR WANTING HUGE RATE CUTS. JOE: UNDERSTOOD. MICHAEL MCKEE. GREAT TO SEE YOU. ON THE FRIDAY BEFORE A LONG WEEKEND, WE SAW THIS STORY COMING A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. TO THINK WE ARE GOING INTO A LONG WEEKEND WITH LITTLE CERTAINTY ON HOW THIS IS GOING TO END IS REALLY SOMETHING. NATOSHA HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS AS PRESIDENT AND COFOUNDER OF THE YALE BUDGET LAB. AS DEPUTY ASSISTANCE SECRETARY FOR ECONOMIC POLICY, FORMER COUNSELOR TO TREASURY SECRETARY JANET YELLEN IN THE UNITED STATES TREASURY DEPARTMENT. GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK. HOW SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT THIS? IT WILL BE PRECEDENT SETTING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. > > IT IS A BIGGER ISSUE THAN ANYTHING ABOUT LISA COOK OR ANYTHING ABOUT MORTGAGES IN THAT YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONS AND CAUSES OF AMERICAN ECONOMIC STRENGTH IS THE FACT WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT CENTRAL BANK THAT MAKES MONETARY POLICY DECISIONS ABSENT FROM POLITICAL INFLUENCE BASED ONLY ON HOW IT BASE VALID INFLATION IN THE LABOR MARKET. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING PLAY OUT IS POTENTIALLY QUITE DAMAGING CONVERSATION AROUND WHETHER THAT TYPE OF INSTITUTION SHOULD ACTUALLY BE FREE FROM POLITICAL INFLUENCE. THE REASON I KNOW IT IS DAMAGING IS BECAUSE WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE IT BEFORE IN THE U.S. WE'VE HAD A POLITICIZED FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION THAT MADE RATE DECISIONS ACCORDING TO HOW THEY WOULD BEST BE SUITED TO HELP PRESIDENT NIXON WIN A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. THE RESULT WAS WE SAW THE WORST STAGFLATION IN THIS COUNTRY IN RECENT HISTORY AND INFLATION RISE FROM 3% TO 13%. WE ARE RUNNING SOME REAL RISKS AND THEY ARE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL. MUCH BIGGER THAN ANY ONE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL OR CASE. JOE: WHAT IS THE FED GOING TO LOOK LIKE SIX MONTHS FROM NOW? > > I HOPE THE ANSWER IS NOT THAT DIFFERENT THAN IT LOOKS TODAY. PART OF WHAT GIVES ME HOPE IS YOU ARE WATCHING THIS PLAY OUT IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THROUGH THE JUDICIARY THAT WILL GET TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE SUPREME COURT WENT OUT OF ITS WAY IN A REMOVAL CASE THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO SIGNAL THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE AS AN INSTITUTION AND ITS UNIQUE BECAUSE I PRIVATE ROLE IN THIS ECONOMY SUCH THAT IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE, THERE WERE REAL LIMITS ON THE PRESIDENT'S ABILITY TO REMOVE AT WILL MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND THE CHAIR OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. IN SOME SENSE, I'M HOPING THAT THEY ARE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR BEING VERY EXPLICIT HERE THAT THIS IS NOT A CASE IN WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO ALLOW THE EXECUTIVE TO HAVE UNFETTERED CAPACITY TO REMOVE AND INSTALL POLITICAL OPERATIVES IN THIS ROLE. BUT IT IS A UNIQUE CASE WHERE THEY DEMAND WE REMAIN AN INDEPENDENT MONETARY POLICY INSTITUTION. JOE: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU THINK STEPHEN MYRON WILL MAKE THE NEXT MEETING. HE'S GOT HIS CONFIRMATION HEARING NEXT WEEK. BUT CHRISTOPHER WALLER IS CALLING FOR LOWER RATES. MORE ADDITIONAL CUTS OVER THE NEXT THREE TO SIX MONTHS. THE PACE DRIVEN BY INCOMING DATA. YOU CAN WEIGH IN ON THE RATE CUT IF YOU WANT. BUT THERE ARE WORRIES OF PRESIDENT TRUMP GOES THROUGH WITH IT, AND LISA COOK IS IN FACT FIRED FOR CAUSE, YOU WILL SEE A BIG DROP IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES BECAUSE OF A TRUMP FRIENDLY FED. BUT THE LONGER TERM RATES WILL KEEP RISING FOR FEAR OF A GREATER INFLATIONARY TREND. > > IT IS INTERESTING. I THINK THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL ROOM FOR DEBATE AND YOU SEE IT AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WITH RESPECT TO HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS PARTICULAR ECONOMIC MOMENT. ON THE ONE HAND, THE MOST INFLATIONARY POLICIES WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR LIFETIMES WITH RESPECT TO TARIFFS IN 18 PLUS PERCENT EFFECTIVE RATE IN THE ECONOMY. ON THE OTHER HAND, A LABOR MARKET STARTING TO COOL. GOVERNOR WALLER IN THE DIRECTION OF BEING CONCERNED ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET. EVEN THE DISSENT ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IN THE MOMENT, WHETHER YOU HOLD RATES STEADY OR YOU CUT RATES BY 25 BASIS POINTS. NOWHERE NEAR THE RATE CUTS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE CALLED FOR. THERE IS ROOM ABOUT WHETHER THE FED WAITS OR CONTINUES OR STARTS TO LOWER RATES. I DON'T THINK YOU ARE CLOSER SHOULD BE CLOSE TO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN PUSHING. THE THING THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THE FLIPSIDE OF THIS. LET'S ASSUME YOU'RE IN A WORLD IN WHICH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD DECIDES WE WILL LOWER INTEREST RATES TO THE 1% THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CALLED FOR. IT IS PRETTY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, IT IS NOT GOING TO DO TO MORTGAGE RATES WHAT THE PRESIDENT MIGHT LIKE TO SEE. PRECISELY BECAUSE YOU MIGHT SEE THE SHORT-TERM RATE WHICH BANKS BORROW FROM ONE ANOTHER, THE FED FUNDS RATE WITH THE FED CONTROLS. BUT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTUATE WHAT MORTGAGE RATES OR OTHER RATES WE CARE ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS RATE LOANS ARE IN THE ECONOMY BECAUSE IT MATTERS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THE MARKET PERCEIVES AS LONGER-TERM TRENDS IN INTEREST RATES. WHAT THE MARKET WILL PERCEIVE IS WE DID THE POLITICIZED THING. BUT WE WILL BE LIKE IN THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION, FACING A SUBSTANTIAL INFLATIONARY OUTLOOK AND FORCE RATES IN THE FUTURE AND THEY WILL BE HIGH AS A RESULT OF THAT. IN SOME SENSE THIS IS INCREDIBLY DAMAGING TO THE FED IS AN INSTITUTION AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE GOAL OF LOWERING INTEREST RATES IN THE ECONOMY. IF THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN, I HAVE AN EASY SOLUTION FOR WHICH THEY HAVE DIRECT CONTROL, ROLLBACK THESE EXECS HIGH TARIFFS. > > WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT CAN GO WRONG. THERE'S APPARENTLY A THIRD MORTGAGE APPLICATION THAT MAY NOT HELP LISA COOK'S CASE. AT LEAST FROM WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. WE THINK ABOUT THINGS THAT CAN GO RIGHT, IT WILL BE A PRESET RULING SETTING. LISA COOK KEEPS HER JOB BASED ON A SUPREME COURT RULING. WHAT WOULD IT MEAN FOR SUPREME FED INDEPENDENCE GOING FORWARD? > > I HOPE IT MEANS WE ENTRENCH IN THIS COUNTRY THE LEGAL RESPECT FOR THE INCREDIBLE IMPORTANCE INSTITUTIONALLY TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE INCREDIBLE IMPORTANCE TO OUR COUNTRIES. NOT JUST ECONOMIC SECURITY, BUT PLACED IN THE GLOBAL WORLD ORDER WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEPENDENCE OF THIS INSTITUTION AND WHY IT IS CRITICAL IS IT HAS TAKEN DECADES TO BE ABLE TO THE THE TYPE OF COUNTRY THAT ENJOYS THE SAFE HARBOR PREMIUM ALLOWED TO BORROW AT LOWER RATES. IN TURBULENT WATERS AT TIMES. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU ARE NO LONGER THAT, THAT CREDIBILITY THAT TOOK DECADES TO BUILD, IT CAN EVAPORATE VERY QUICKLY. WHEN YOU ARE NO LONGER THAT, IT TRANSLATES INTO REAL ECONOMIC COSTS, AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT FRIENDLY FOR BUSINESS INVESTMENT. HIGHER MORTGAGE RATES FOR HOUSEHOLDS AND BORROWERS IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M HOPEFUL WE WILL SEE ENTRENCHED A RESPECT FOR SOMETHING SO PIVOTAL TO OUR ECONOMIC STRENGTH. JOE: WITH ALL OF THIS SAID, I'M OUT OF TIME. I ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF SECONDS. DID THE FED DO THE RIGHT THING BY NOT WEIGHING IN? > > THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS DOING WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO IN THE CASE. AS A PARTY IN THE SUIT, A COMPLICATED JUDICIAL DANCE TO BE DOING IT. DOING EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE DOING. JOE: THANK YOU FOR JOINING, AS ALWAYS. THE PRESIDENT AND COFOUNDER OF THE YALE BUDGET LAB. FORMER COUNSELOR TO TREASURY SECRETARY JANET YELLEN. I'M JOE MATHIEU. WE WILL ASSEMBLE OUR PANEL NEXT. RICK DAVIS AND JEANNE SHEEHAN ZAINO. > > IT IS 1:21 ON WALL STREET. WE CHECK MARKETS ALL DAY LONG. KRAFT HEINZ NEARING A BREAKUP ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. SHARES UP BY 1.7 PERCENT. STOCKS LOWER ACROSS THE BOARD. S & P 500 INDEX CLOSE TO SESSION LOWS. 6452. WE HAVE THE DOW DOWN 141, .30%. NASDAQ 1.3%. STOCKS ARE DECLINING. WE HAVE THE 10 YEAR FAT 4.21%. RIGHT NOW, THE TWO-YEAR YIELDING 3.61%. SPOT GOLD. UP 1% RIGHT NOW. WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE CRUDE DOWN .9%. WTI, AND BITCOIN DOWN 3.1%. PETCO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SHARES ARE SURGING AFTER RAISING ITS EARNINGS TARGETS FOR THE YEAR. THE TURNAROUNDS START SHOWING SIGNS OF PROGRESS. CHOOSING THE TICKER WOLF. UP BY 20 POINT 4%. OTHER EARNINGS NEWS, GAP UP TO .5% AS INVESTORS WAY TARIFFS AND SALES HEADING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AFTER EARNINGS. ALTO BEAUTY DOWN BY 6.2%. THE S & P DOWN .8%. BALANCE OF POWER CONTINUES. BACK TO WASHINGTON. ONCE AGAIN, JOE MATHIEU. JOE: MANY THANKS. WE WILL GET BACK TO CHARLIE PELLETT. WATCHING WALL STREET FROM HIS PERCH AT WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. AS WE BRING YOU NEWS EVERY DAY FROM WASHINGTON. IN MANY CASES, MARKET MOVING NEWS. A LITTLE BIT MORE ABSTRACT IN THE CASE OF LISA COOK. BUT WALL STREET IS WATCHING. THE BOND MARKET CERTAINLY IS. THE JUDGE DID NOT INDICATE WHICH WAY SHE WAS LEADING IN THE EMERGENCY HEARING THAT STARTED AT 10:00 A.M. IT CONCLUDED WITH NO RULING AS THE JUDGE PEPPERED LAWYERS FOR BOTH SIDES, LISA COOK AND THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT TWO HOURS WITHOUT RULING ON THE FED GOVERNOR REQUEST FOR A TEMPORARY ORDER. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS WITH THE PANEL ALONG WITH THE GREATER VIEW ON WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. BEYOND LISA COOK, THE FIRINGS WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE HEAD OF THE CDC AND OTHER AGENCIES, THE PRESIDENT IS CLEARLY SHAPING IN HIS OWN VISION. SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT WITH DONALD EYRE, THE FORMER DEPUTY SOLICITOR GENERAL, FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL JOINED US IN STUDIO TO EXPRESS HIS CONCERNS ABOUT THE CHANGES HE FEARS IN SOME CASES COULD BE IRREVERSIBLE. > > IT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS, THE PATTERN THAT HAS CLEARLY EMERGED SINCE THE INAUGURATION, A PATTERN OF A ONE INSTANCE AFTER ANOTHER WORKING TO ESSENTIALLY OVERTHROW THE NORMS, PROCEDURES, CHECKS OF OUR PROCESS. THAT IS THE REAL CONCERN WE SHOULD ALL HAVE. JOE: WE PLAY IT TO THE PANEL ON OUR FRIDAY EDITION. RICK DAVIS AND JEANNE SHEEHAN ZAINO ARE WITH US. RICK IS A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND PARTNER AT STONECOURT CAPITAL. JEANNE SHEEHAN ZAINO IS A VISITING FELLOW AT HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL. OUR DEMOCRATIC ANALYST, ALWAYS WONDERFUL TO HAVE BOTH OF YOU WITH US. DO YOU SEE IT AS DONALD AIR DOES, A TEST OF THE SYSTEM? WE SEE DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO EXERCISE THE LIMITS OF HIS POWER AS AN EXECUTIVE. IS IT CAUSE FOR CONCERN? > > I THINK ANYONE WHO IS USED TO THE STANDARD CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT HAVE EXISTED THROUGHOUT THE MODERN PRESIDENCY, WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EMERGENCE OF DONALD TRUMP AND HIS EXECUTIVE THEORY THAT IS CLEARLY BEING IMPLEMENTED IN EVERY ONE OF THESE INSTANCES. HIS TEST TO SEE IF HE COULD FIRE LISA COOK IS AN EXERCISE OF THE CONCEPT ARTICLE TWO IN THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THE PRESIDENT HAS SOLE POWER TO GOVERN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND HE'S TESTING EVERY ASPECT OF THAT IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF OFFICE. IN THE EXTREME, A UNITARY THEORY LIKE THIS COULD DIMINISH THE ROLES OF CHECKS AND BALANCES IN THE LEGAL AND CONGRESSIONAL SIDE. IT IS SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE ON BECAUSE IT IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR LIFETIMES. JOE: FOR YEARS TO THINK ABOUT THIS. A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND HIM TO HELP HIM SUCCEED IN THESE GOALS OF PUSHING THE LINES OF AUTHORITY FROM THE OVAL OFFICE. IF YOU ARE A TRUMP SUPPORTER, THIS IS ALL UP. YOU ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, BUT YOU HAVE THROWN DOWN A NUMBER OF FLAGS AND ISSUED A NUMBER OF WARNINGS ABOUT THE CHECKS AND BALANCES RICK DAVIS REFERS TO. IF THEY GO AWAY, CAN YOU EVER GET THEM BACK? > > WE WOULD HOPE SO. BUT CHALLENGING, LEGALLY CHALLENGING IN COURT IS NOT THE PROBLEM. IT IS A LOT FOR YOU TO COVER EVERY DAY, A LOT FOR ALL OF US TO WATCH. WHAT IS MOST CONCERNING TO ME IS THE FACT NOT JUST THE PRESIDENT CHALLENGING HIS POWER IF HE DOES SO AND HE LISTENS TO THE RULINGS BY JUDGES, THE FACT HE'S TRYING TO OFFEND ANY SENSE OF AGREEMENT ON WHAT IS TRUTH. THERE IS AN OLD SAYING THAT SAYS WHEN YOU DON'T ADHERE TO OR LISTEN TO FACTS, YOU ABANDON YOUR FREEDOM BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY TO FIGHT BACK IF WE DON'T HAVE AN AGREED-UPON FACT LANGUAGE EVIDENCE-BASED UNDERSTANDING. THAT TO ME IS THE MOST TROUBLING ASPECT OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. WHETHER IT IS THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS, THE ISSUE INVOLVING THE FED. IT IS STARTLING TO ME THAT JD VANCE WENT OUT YESTERDAY IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH ANOTHER OUTLET AND SAID IT DOES NOT REALLY MATTER IF WHAT LISA COOK DID IS ILLEGAL OR NOT. WHAT MATTERS IS SHE'S NOT SERVING THE PRESIDENT. THAT IS NOT WHAT MATTERS HERE. YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW DUE PROCESS AND WE HAVE TO HAVE AN AGREED-UPON UNDERSTANDING OF FACTS IN ORDER TO MAKE POLICY IN THIS COUNTRY GOING FORWARD. THAT TO ME IS THE MOST TROUBLING COMPONENT AND THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN PUSHING THOSE BOUNDARIES IN A WAY WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN THE U.S., BUT WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN ELSEWHERE. JOE: YOU WONDER IF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES WILL BE RESTORED IN CONGRESS. IT HAS BEEN THE COURTS PUSHING BACK. BUT BILL CASSIDY HAS BEEN DOING SOME HARD THINKING WHEN IT COMES TO THE CDC AND THE CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. THE CDC DIRECTOR WAS FIRED. FOUR LEADERS RESIGNED, AND WE SAW THE RANK AND FILE HOLD A PROTEST ON THE STREETS IN FRONT OF THE AGENCY. SENATOR BILL CASSIDY GOT A PROMISE FROM RFK JR. THAT THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN AND THE VACCINE POLICY WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED BY HIS PERSONAL BELIEFS. CASSIDY SAYS IT IS TIME TO CANCEL THE VACCINE ADVISORY MEETING SET FOR SEPTEMBER AND THE HELP COMMITTEE MUST PROVIDE OVERSIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO THESE POSITIONS EITHER BEING FIRED OR VACATED THROUGH RESIGNATION. IS THE SENATE ABOUT TO STAND UP? > > IT IS HARD TO TELL. SPEAKING OF EXERCISING, THEIR POWERS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND CONSENT ON THESE PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENTS IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ASPECTS OF THEIR LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY. IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE OF CONTROVERSIAL MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP CABINET, THEY WERE ABLE TO BECOME APPOINTED BY A TIE-BREAKING VOTE BY THE VICE PRESIDENT. THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH SENATORS TO STAND UP AND SAY TULSI GABBARD, TO JFK JUNIOR THIS IS A NO. SO THEY KIND OF ADVOCATED THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE TO HOLD THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH FEET TO THE FIRE WHEN APPOINTING INDIVIDUALS TO HIGH OFFICE. IT MAKES SENSE THEY WILL WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTION THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING BEFORE THE IMPLEMENT IT. THAT IS THE PROPER ROLE OF OVERSIGHT. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY STIFFEN AND SAY WE ARE GOING FORWARD WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND WE ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE RULES TO MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN. JOE: RFK JR. IN A MEMO TO STAFF, WRITING REFORM DOES NOT DIMINISH YOUR WORK. IT STRENGTHENS IT. IS HE RIGHT? > > THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH REFORM. THE PROBLEM IS IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE THE REPORTS COMING OUT, HE APPARENTLY IS NOT LISTENING TO TAKING THE ADVICE OF EVEN MEETING WITH THOSE EXPERTS IN THE CDC WHO HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO ADVISE HIM PROPERLY. SO I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE REPORT COMES OUT ON AUTISM AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN AUTISM AND VACCINATIONS, WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY DISCREDITED. WE HEARD JUST THE OTHER DAY IN THE CABINET MEETING THE SECRETARY PROMISING PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO HAS ALSO EXPRESSED BELIEF IN THAT CONNECTION, UNFOUNDED AS IT IS, THAT THE REPORT WAS COMING IN. A LOT OF SPECULATION IN. A LOT OF SPECULATION THE CDC WAS REMOVED BECAUSE SHE WAS PUSHING BACK ON THAT. AND WE DON'T KNOW. THE SECRETARY IS TALKING ABOUT REFORM. WE WELCOME REFORM. THE CDC NEEDS REFORM. BUT YOU SIMPLY CANNOT LOSE ALL OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND AN INSTITUTION AND REFORM IT PROPERLY, BRINGING IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO EXPERTISE IN THIS CASE IN SCIENCE OR MEDICINE. JOE: WE HEARD FROM DIMITRI DOING SOME INTERVIEWS. THIS IS THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL CENTER FOR IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES WHO RESIGNED YESTERDAY. HIS RESIGNATION LETTER MADE THE ROUNDS. HE DID AN INTERVIEW WITH THE ATLANTIC AND SAID NO ONE FROM HIS CENTER HAD EVER BEEN ALLOWED TO BRIEF THE SECRETARY, RFK JR.. > > I'M NOT SURE WHERE HE'S GETTING HIS INFORMATION OTHER THAN SUB STOCKS THAT ARE ERRONEOUS. WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE THE HHS? > > THIS WAS THE MOTIVATION BEHIND SENATOR CASSIDY AND HIS QUESTIONS OF SECRETARY KENNEDY BEFORE HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIM A VOTE ON HIS NOMINATION. PUT A RAIN ON THIS ISSUE OF ATTACKING THE VACCINE POLICY THAT EXISTS TODAY AND HE GOT A COMMITMENT. THAT COMMITMENT DID NOT LAST NINE MONTHS. I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF RECOGNITION AND REALIZATION IN THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS OF THE U.S. SENATE THAT THEY ARE A PARTY TO THIS KIND OF DISMANTLING OF GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN REFORM AN AGENCY WITHOUT LOSING ITS EXPERTISE. VIRTUALLY EVERY ADMINISTRATION PUTS ITS STAMP ON IT LIKE THAT. BUT TO DRIVE OUT VERY TALENTED PEOPLE AND REPLACE THEM WITH FOLKS WHO HAVE NO BASIC EXPERIENCE IN THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE AGENCY WILL NOT BUILD CONFIDENCE WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. WE STARTED THIS SEGMENT TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP HAS POTENTIAL LOW OVERREACH AND LOSING THE CONFIDENCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I WOULD SAY ISSUES LIKE THIS DRIVE YOU IN THAT DIRECTION. JOE: QUITE A MOMENT WE ARE IN. NEXT THURSDAY WILL BE THE HEARING. THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE HEARING FOR RFK JR.'S TESTIMONY. I'M SURE THERE WILL BE TOUGH QUESTIONS. MANY THANKS TO OUR RATE PANEL ON THE FRIDAY EDITION. RICK DAVIS AND. I HOPE YOU BOTH HAVE A LONG WEEKEND AND WE WILL SEE YOU ON THE TUESDAY EDITION. NOT TO MENTION THE LATE EDITION LATER THIS EVENING. I'M JOE MATHIEU IN WASHINGTON. MORE TO COVER ON THE FAST A SHOW IN POLITICS. > > WE DO CHECK MARKETS ALL DAY LONG. WE HAVE THE DOW, THE S & P, NASDAQ IN THE RED. TRADERS DRIVING STOCKS LOWER AMID A SELLOFF IN TECH SHARES. EMPOWERING THE SURGE SINCE APRIL'S MELTDOWN. THE S & P MOVING LOWER BY 46 POINTS.

FOR ON DEMAND NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY, SUBSCRIBE TO BLOOMBERG NEWS NOW WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS. BACK TO WASHINGTON. HERE HE IS, JOE MATHIEU. JOE: THANK YOU. WE HAVE A BIG WEEKEND IN WASHINGTON. A LONG WEEKEND, MARKETS ARE CLOSED ON MONDAY. WE WILL DO THE SMITHSONIAN OR SOMETHING. THIS HAS BEEN THE BIG STORY MOST RECENTLY. THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OTHER CITIES WILL FOLLOW. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FEDERALIZATION, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN USE THAT TERM, THE INTRODUCTION OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKING ALONGSIDE POLICE. THEY ADDED ARMED NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS. QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH LAWMAKERS AND WHETHER THEY WANT TO SEE MORE FOR LONGER. IT WOULD TAKE AN ACT OF CONGRESS TO MAINTAIN BEYOND 30 DAYS. NOT TO MENTION OTHER CITIES. THE PRESIDENT TO CHICAGO, NEW YORK, AND OTHERS. LISTEN TO WHAT MIKE JOHNSON HAD TO SAY. > > I TOLD THE PRESIDENT YESTERDAY MORNING, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. WE WILL GIVE YOU THE AUTHORITY NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THIS JOB. THE DEMOCRAT MAYOR CAME OUT AND SAID THANK YOU FOR THE REINFORCEMENT. WE HAVE TO BRING LAW AND ORDER BACK. WE ARE THE PARTY, HE IS THE PRESIDENT TO DO THAT. THE STATISTICS ARE OVERWHELMING. IT IS RIDICULOUS FOR HIM TO DENY HE NEEDS ASSISTANCE WITH IT. I HOPE THE NATIONAL GUARD GOES TO CHICAGO. JOE: WE WILL SEE IF THAT HAPPENS. WE THOUGHT WE WOULD SPEND TIME WITH A RESIDENT OF WASHINGTON, D.C. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF. PATRICK MCHENRY, CONTRIBUTOR FOR FORMER CHAIR OF THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE AND FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER PRO TEM. GREAT TO SEE YOU. YOU LIVE ON CAPITOL HILL, KNOWN TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF CRYING. LAWMAKERS COME FROM ALL DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING RURAL AREAS WHO MAY NOT BE USED TO THE GAME WHERE WE HAVE SEEN CARJACKING AND OTHER STUFF EVEN IF CRIME RATES ARE WHAT THEY SAY, A 30 YEAR LOW. WHAT IS THE MINDSET AMONG THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE WHEN THEY COME BACK AND DONALD TRUMP ASKS FOR MORE TIME? > > LAWMAKERS TRAVERSE A VERY NARROW RANGE OF WASHINGTON, D.C., THEY ARE NOT HERE FOR TOURIST ATTRACTIONS, THEY ARE ON CAPITOL HILL FOR MEETINGS AND DINNERS AND BREAKFAST. THAT IS ABOUT IT. FROM THEIR VINTAGE POINT, THEY HAVE CAPITOL POLICE, METRO POLICE, THEY ARE WELL COVERED FOR BASIC SECURITY MEASURES. HAVING SAID THAT, YOU HAVE HIGH-PROFILE CASES OF DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS EXPERIENCING CARJACKING, PHYSICAL ASSAULT OF A COUPLE BLOCKS FROM THE CAPITAL. VERY REAL IN URBAN AMERICA TODAY . COMING OFF OF COVID THE STATS WERE INCREDIBLE FOR HOW BAD D.C. AND A LOT OF PLACES LIKE CHICAGO HAVE BEEN. THERE IS A PERCEPTION ACROSS AMERICA. FOR THE REST OF AMERICA, AN URBAN CRIME PROBLEM. THAT IS WHY YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING TO THIS. IS THERE SOMETHING TO IT? YES. IS IT AS DRAMATIC AS IT HAS BEEN MADE OUT TO BE BY THE WHITE HOUSE? NOT REALLY. BUT THESE ARE GREAT STATS. THE DEMOCRATIC MAYOR OF WASHINGTON, D.C. IS SAYING THESE HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON REDUCING CRIME RATES. THE ATTENTION TO THE MATTER. IF WE TAKE THE ATTENTION OFF, THE CRIME WILL REAPPEAR UNLESS WE CHANGE. JOE: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD OTHER CITIES? IT IS ONE THING THE FEDERAL CITY GIVES THE PRESIDENT MORE LEEWAY. IF YOU ROLL INTO CHICAGO LIKE THIS, PARTICULARLY WITH NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS, IT IS A DIFFERENT CONSTRUCT. THE PUSHBACK FROM GOVERNORS HAS BEEN VERY LOUD. IS THERE A LINE FOR REPUBLICANS, LAWMAKERS ON THIS WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER CITIES OR WHEN IT COMES TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEDERAL POLICE AND THE NATIONAL GUARD? > > FRANKLY, IT IS FOR THE VOTERS OF THE JURISDICTIONS TO VOTE IN PEOPLE WHO WILL KEEP THEM SAFE. WE SAW THIS IN SAN FRANCISCO. A DRAMATIC REVERSAL FROM A VERY SOFT ON CRIME REGIME IN AN ALL DEMOCRATIC CITY TO A NOW TOUGH ON CRIME REGIME WITH ENCAMPMENTS AND ASSAULTS, VEHICLES DISAPPEARING, CVS IS BEING RATED. EVERY RETAIL STORE POSSIBLE BEING RATED. AND THEY PUT IN A NEW GOVERNMENT. CHICAGO HAS TO DO THE SAME. THEY HAVE TO VOTE FOR SOMETHING BETTER TO GET DIFFERENT RESULTS. L: YOU ALSO SAY IT IS NOT UP TO DONALD TRUMP. > > IT IS NOT UP TO THE PRESIDENT TO KEEP MISMANAGED, BADLY RUN CITIES AND SAVE THEIR POLITICIANS OR GIVE POLITICIANS A FOIL TO KEEP THAT GOVERNMENT IN. THERE IS ENOUGH TO PRESIDE OVER AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY MEASURES. INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES. ECONOMIC ISSUES. WE HAVE BIG THINGS WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON IN WASHINGTON, ESPECIALLY THE PRESIDENT. JOE: LIKE FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT. EVERYONE TURNED AWAY FROM THE SHUTDOWN TALK IN THE RESCISSIONS AND HOW MUCH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS CAN'T TRUST EACH OTHER BECAUSE WE GOT INTO THE WHOLE EPSTEIN THING IN THE THROES OF SUMMER NEWS. WE ARE NOT DONE WITH THAT. WHAT IS TOP OF MIND IS LAWMAKERS COME BACK? WILL WE BE HEARING ABOUT EPSTEIN NEXT WEEK? > > SURE. THE FBI DIRECTOR AND -- TESTIFYING BEFORE THE HILL IN THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER LIKE THREE WEEKS FROM NOW. THERE WILL BE DISCUSSIONS OF THAT, ABOUT KEEPING THE GOVERNMENT OPEN. ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE FOR THE FED SEAT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY OPEN. THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON. JOE: THE RFK JR. HEARING. WHEN IT COMES TO APPROPRIATIONS, IS THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM CORRECT? > > IT IS REALLY OPEN TO THE DEMOCRATIC MINORITY IN THE SENATE. SPEAKER JOHNSON SHOWED THEY CAN PASS A CONTINUED RESOLUTION LIKE IN MARCH. ITS OWN POLITICAL MIRACLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. JOE: CHUCK SCHUMER HAS TOUGH DECISIONS TO MAKE. > > THIS TIME AROUND. YOU HAVE ENOUGH REPUBLICAN VOTES TO PASS SOMETHING, BUT NOT TO GET TO THE 60 VOTE CLOTURE. THE VOTE THAT THEY NEED FOR FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT. SO IT IS IN SCHUMER'S HANDS. THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON HIM. WHAT HE WANTS, HIS EXPECTATIONS, BECAUSE HE WILL BE THE DECIDER ON WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. > > IF WE DO, EVERY DEMOCRAT HAS SAID WE CANNOT DO IT UNLESS THERE IS A PLAN TO REOPEN BECAUSE IF DONALD TRUMP GETS A CLOSE, HE HAS NO INTEREST IN REOPENING IT. > > THE BUDGET DIRECTOR FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SO DESPERATELY -- WANTS CHUCK SCHUMER AND THE DEMOCRATS TO SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN. > > THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN? > > WE WILL FIND OUT. BUT HE HAS A DETAILED PLAN AND THE GOAL IS TO WIN THE SHUTDOWN. REPUBLICANS HAD SHUTDOWNS IN THE 90'S ALL THE WAY THROUGH A FEW YEARS AGO. NOT WINNING SHUTDOWN, HE INTENDS TO CHANGE THAT. HE THOUGHT DEEPLY ABOUT IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND SCHUMER MAY GIVE HIM THAT OPPORTUNITY. EITHER OCTOBER 1 OR LATE IN THE FALL OR INTO JANUARY. JOE: IF IT HAPPENS IT IS A RECORD? > > IT WOULD BE A RECORD, IT WOULD BE BAD FOR DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS WHO DID NOT FUND THE GOVERNMENT. A GOVERNMENT THEY HELPED FUND AND BUILD, IT WOULD BE A BAD THING FOR DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS. WHAT I WOULD TELL MY DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS IS GET OUT OF THE WAY OF YOUR OWN FOLLY. FUND THE GOVERNMENT, GET OUT OF THE WAY AND MOVED TO SERIOUS FIGHTS FOR THE BALLOT BOX IN THE MIDTERMS. IF THEY DON'T DO THAT, IT WILL BE A TASTY, GREAT FIGHT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AGAINST CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS. JOE: OCTOBER WILL BE A RIOT. > > IT WILL BECOME A BUT FOR US TO SIT BEHIND THE MICROPHONES, MORE INTERESTING. JOE: DEMOCRATS WOULD SAY YOU DID THAT RESCISSIONS PACKAGE, SO WE CANNOT TRUST YOU IN A BUDGET DEAL ANYWAY. AND REPUBLICANS SAY WE ARE GOING TO DO ANOTHER ONE. IS IT COMING? > > ABSOLUTELY. THEY HAVE TO DETERMINE WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. THE TYPE OF FIGHT THEY WANT TO HAVE. BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE CURRENTLY THE LARGEST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE HAVE HAD OUTSIDE OF WARTIME. IN THE HISTORY OF THE U.S., THE LARGEST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUTSIDE OF WARTIME. THAT IS TOO BIG. AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR ECONOMY AND RAW DOLLAR NUMBERS, AN ECONOMY THAT IS TOO BIG THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD AS A GREAT SOCIETY. A GOVERNMENT THAT CAN MATCH STATE, LOCAL, AND FEDERAL THAT TELLS EUROPEANS THEY ARE NOT RUNNING A SOCIAL ESTATE, WE ARE. WE HAVE TO GET OUR FINANCIAL HOUSE IN ORDER AND TO PRIORITIZE THAT FIGHT, I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS DOING A GOOD JOB. > > WE HAVE NOT EVEN MENTIONED THE WORD TARIFFS SINCE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING, SOMETHING WE USUALLY GET AROUND TO. HIS CONGRESS HANDS OFF ON THIS? WILL THERE BE A CONGRESSIONAL ANSWER NOW THAT THEY APPEAR TO BE IN PLACE? INDIA JUST GOT SACKED WITH 50%. EVERYONE ELSE HAS A NUMBER RIGHT NOW. > > I WILL TELL YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS COMPLETE MASTERY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. FOLKS ON THE HILL THAT HATE TARIFFS WILL BE QUIET. THE PRESIDENT IS THERE TO GET A BIG DEAL ON TRAINING ARRANGEMENTS. ALL OF IT IS NOISE. WHERE DID WE END UP WITH INDIA, WITH MEXICO? SOME VERY KEY DECISIONS ARE STILL OUT. BUT IT ALL BRINGS TO FOCUS THE MAIN THING. THE MAIN THING IS OUR TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA AND THE GLOBE'S TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA. THAT CANNOT BE MISSED IN ALL OF THIS. A LOT OF STUFF IN WASHINGTON. A LOT OF NOISE. THAT IS THE SIGNAL YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW. THE WHITE HOUSE IS VERY FOCUSED, AND TREASURY AND COMMERCE, ARE VERY FOCUSED ON LANDING A DEAL WITH CHINA THAT IS DURABLE FOR THE LONG TERM. JOE: HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW LISA COOK? > > A LITTLE BIT. I INTERACTED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE FED. > > THAT IS WHY ASK. SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN VETTED ALREADY, WHO IS BEING QUESTIONED BY THREE MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS. THERE WAS A BIG EMERGENCY HEARING DOWN THE STREET ARGUING ABOUT CAUSE. THEY LEFT WITHOUT A RULING. HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEING IMPACTED? > > IT IS CONCERNING. THE REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE TO THE FED. NUMBER TWO, THE QUESTION OF ONE PERSON GETTING BOUNCED FROM THE FED. ONE APPOINTEE GETTING REMOVED FOR CAUSE. THE COURTS HAVE TO DECIDE ON THIS. IT IS A 110 YEAR OLD STATUTE, UNTESTED, NO PREVIOUS GOVERNOR HAS BEEN REMOVED BY THE PRESIDENT. IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED IN THE COURTS. IT WILL BE TESTED IN THE COURTS. WE WILL FIND OUT. THAT IS DETERMINATIVE ON THE ACT. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS NO LONGER INDEPENDENT. IT IS WHAT -- WHAT COMES NEXT THAT COULD UNRAVEL FED INDEPENDENCE. IN TERMS OF WHAT OTHER PARTICIPATING ACTS CAN IMPAIR THE FED INDEPENDENCE. > > LIKE REACHING INTO THE 12 REGIONAL BANKS? > > CORRECT. THAT IS AN OPEN QUESTION. INDEPENDENT BOARDS. THE NATURE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS BUILT ON THE NATURE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES. THAT MEANS SEPARATION OF POWER AND REPRESENTATIVE BANKS. WE HAVE A DIVERSE GROUP OF BANKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE VOICES FOR THAT REGION AND KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING FOR THE ECONOMY. BRING THOSE LESSONS TO WASHINGTON AND BE THE REGION'S VOICE. IT IS A COMPLICATED STRUCTURE. THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER PIECES OF CONGRESSIONAL CREATION. THE SUPREME COURT HAS RULED THAT . IT IS SPECIAL AND DISTINCT IN THE NATURE OF CENTRAL BANKING BACK TO THE FIRST AND SECOND BANK OF THE U.S. AND THE FOUNDING FATHERS WERE STILL ALIVE WRITING THOSE STATUTES AROUND THE CENTRAL BANK AT THE TIME. THOSE THINGS ARE TESTED. THE SUPREME COURT HAS OPINED ON THIS. IT IS A QUESTION OF LOWER COURTS MAKING THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY FOLLOWED THE STATUTE IN THE CLEAR LETTER OF THE LAW. > > GOING TO HAVE A HARD SESSION. > > IT WILL BE THE CRAZIEST FIREWORKS ON ANY FED GOVERNOR NOMINEE. JOE: IT WILL BE SOMETHING ELSE. SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE. WE WILL INTERPRET THIS WITH THE HELP OF PATRICK MCHENRY. FORMER CONGRESSMAN, I'M JOE MATHIEU IN WASHINGTON. WE WILL MEET YOU FOR THE LATE EDITION, 5:00 P.M. BALANCE OF POWER.",

  "summary": "LISA COOK's Emergency Hearing in Washington ended without a ruling, allowing both sides to argue over President Trump's attempt to fire the FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR. The hearing was part of a larger legal inquiry into whether COOK should be removed from her role as the role of the executive of the federal judiciary. The S&P and NASDAQ have seen significant declines in technology this year, with S& P down 41.3%, NASDAQ down 238 POINTS, and CES up 2.9%. Meanwhile, the president's efforts to have COOK fired have been met with resistance, with both sides questioning the legality of the case.",
