      "feedback": "The analysis provides a solid overview of the current macroeconomic landscape shaped by trade policies and protectionism under the Trump administration, but it could benefit from deeper causal reasoning and specificity. To elevate the analysis to world-class quality, clarify the causal chain linking tariffs to consumer price increases and domestic production impacts, using quantitative data where possible (e.g., projected price increases or GDP impacts). Ensure alignment with the multi-year horizon focus by discussing potential long-term structural shifts in the economy, such as changes in consumer behavior or industry dynamics. Incorporate first-principles grounding by referencing real rate differentials and terms-of-trade implications. Enhance specificity regarding catalysts and triggers, such as the timeline for tariff implementation and potential retaliatory measures. Finally, increase citation density by referencing more critical sources and reconciling any conflicting information, particularly regarding the semiconductor sector and international responses.",
