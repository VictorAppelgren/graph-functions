Kemczynski explained that while real wages have improved, \u201creal incomes are down with the low-income consumer.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cThere is a lot of anxiety and unease with that low-income consumer\u2026 I think we could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that might have\u2026\u201d He also pointed to declining visits from this demographic, which are \u201cdown double digits versus the prior year period.\u201d\nTo combat this, the company is doubling down on value and menu innovation. McDonald\u2019s is testing a new beverage lineup and has seen early success with the reintroduction of Snack Wraps at a $2.99 price point.\nThe company\u2019s international division, which saw comparable sales growth of 4%, continues to outperform, with markets like Germany and France leveraging \u201ceveryday affordable price\u201d menus to drive market share gains.\nSee Also: Trump Tariffs Challenge SMCI\u2019s AI Business, But Global Supply Chain Eases Blow After Weak Q4\nWhy It Matters: McDonald\u2019s reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.19, beating the analyst consensus estimate of $3.14. While its quarterly sales of $6.843 billion outpaced the Street view of $6.682 billion.\nRevenues from franchised restaurants rose 7% year over year to $4.213 billion. Starting in September, McDonald's will introduce new cold beverages at about 500 restaurants to attract younger consumers.\nPrice Action: MCD stock rose 2.98% on Wednesday. It was up 5.18% year-to-date and 14.21% over the past year.\nBenzinga's Edge Stock Rankings indicate that MCD maintains a strong price trend in the long term but weaker momentum over the short and medium terms. However, the stock scores well on growth rankings.

      "text": "- Systemwide Comparable Sales1 grew 12.1% versus the prior year, contributing to total company revenues of $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2025.\n- Digital channel sales (from Mobile App, Delivery and Self-order Kiosks) rose 7.9% year-over-year in US dollars and contributed more than 60% of total systemwide sales in the quarter.\n- The Loyalty Program had 21.5 million registered members at the end of the second quarter of 2025, across six available markets.\n- Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA1 was $110.1 million and Net Income was $22.6 million, or $0.11 per share, in the second quarter of 2025.\n- Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was a comfortable 1.4x as of June 30, 2025, which was among the factors cited in S&P's \u2018BBB-' investment grade rating of Arcos Dorados debt.\n- The Company opened 20 Experience of the Future (EOTF) restaurants in the quarter.\nArcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO (\"Arcos Dorados\" or the \"Company\"), Latin America and the Caribbean's largest restaurant chain and the world's largest independent McDonald's franchisee, today reported unaudited results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025.\nMessage from Luis Raganato, Chief Executive Officer\nThe results we are reporting today demonstrate the strength of the Arcos Dorados business model. Each of our markets faced a unique set of operating conditions and each delivered strong results within the context of their individual environments. By staying true to our Purpose, we strengthened our bond with guests and expanded our brand preference throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, Making Every Day an Opportunity to Feed People and Build Dreams.\nBrazil remained resilient despite challenging consumer dynamics, NOLAD showed that the first quarter calendar effects were only temporary and SLAD continued the strong positive trajectory that began at the end of last year. Combined, the three divisions drove local currency revenue almost 15% higher versus the prior year quarter. Systemwide comparable sales growth was particularly strong in NOLAD and SLAD, rising 1.8x and 1.4x blended inflation, respectively.\nMarket share saw robust gains across the region according to our research, thanks to marketing and digital initiatives focused on value and Brand strength, together with an ever-growing Loyalty Program that is successfully increasing guest visit frequency. The Big Fest digital campaign, Minecraft Happy Meal (for both kids and adults) and the limited-time Formula One promotion all helped strengthen the brand attributes that keep guests coming back to our restaurants.\nThe diversified nature of our business model also drove strong profitability in the quarter, despite important cost pressures in some markets. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA declined as reported, but was up 7.1% in US dollars with a 40 basis point margin expansion, when we adjust last year's result for a reduction of labor contingencies due to a favorable judgement in Brazil.\nFinally, our growth plan remains intact, and we opened 20 new EOTF restaurants in the period. This year's growth trajectory also includes the addition of our 21st market: Saint Martin. We believe the choice of Arcos Dorados as the new operator in Saint Martin is a testament to our operational excellence and commitment to growth in the region. We remain convinced there is compelling growth potential for our business and our shareholders for many years to come.\n1 For definitions, please refer to page 7 of this document. |\nAD Holdings Inc. \u2013 Consolidated Key Financial Results\nFigure 1 |\n||||||\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as noted) |\n||||||\n| 2Q24 (a) |\nCurrency Translation (b) |\nConstant Currency Growth (c) |\n2Q25 (a+b+c) |\n% As Reported |\n% Constant Currency |\n|\n| Total Restaurants (Units) | 2,395 |\n2,457 |\n||||\n| Sales by Company-operated Restaurants | 1,060.7 |\n(127.9) |\n158.3 |\n1,091.1 |\n2.9% |\n14.9% |\n| Revenues from franchised restaurants | 50.2 |\n(6.7) |\n7.7 |\n51.2 |\n2.0% |\n15.4% |\n| Total Revenues | 1,110.9 |\n(134.6) |\n166.0 |\n1,142.3 |\n2.8% |\n14.9% |\n| Systemwide Comparable Sales | 12.1% |\n|||||\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 118.8 |\n(11.5) |\n2.8 |\n110.1 |\n-7.3% |\n2.4% |\n| Adjusted EBITDA Margin | 10.7% |\n9.6% |\n-1.1 p.p. |\n|||\n| Net income (loss) attributable to AD | 26.6 |\n(6.7) |\n2.7 |\n22.6 |\n-15.2% |\n10.1% |\n| Net income attributable to AD Margin | 2.4% |\n2.0% |\n-0.4 p.p. |\n|||\n| No. of shares outstanding (thousands) | 210,660 |\n210,663 |\n||||\n| EPS (US$/Share) | 0.13 |\n0.11 |\nArcos Dorados' total revenues reached $1.1 billion, up 2.8% in US dollars versus the prior year quarter. The Company's comparable systemwide sales rose 12.1% in the quarter, driven by strong sales in NOLAD and SLAD, which grew 1.8x and 1.4x blended inflation, respectively. The consumer environment remained challenging in Brazil during the second quarter of 2025.\nThe Company's Digital strategy continued to support sales growth. Digital channel sales rose 7.9% in the period, generating more than 60% of the second quarter's systemwide sales.\nBy the end of the second quarter of 2025, the Company's Loyalty Program was active in 67% of all restaurants in its footprint. The Program remains on target to be available in all main markets by year-end 2025. Offered in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Uruguay, the Loyalty Program reached 21.5 million registered members at the end of the second quarter and was responsible for 22.6% of total sales in these markets.\nThe Company's digital channels supported campaigns designed to strengthen the bond with guests and adapt to changing consumer preferences. This included the Big Fest, which celebrated core favorites at a compelling value, resulting in increased Brand Preference, improved Brand Attributes and strong growth in both Mobile App downloads and Loyalty Program membership.\nIn Brazil, the successful \"M\u00e9qui do Dia\" campaign, offered one menu favorite per day at a compelling value, while the Minecraft Happy Meal enjoyed crossover appeal to both kids and adults throughout the region, which was optimized by offering a unique adult Happy Meal with chicken McNuggets.\nArcos Dorados' regional Formula 1 sponsorship also served to strengthen ties with families and guests of all ages. Capitalizing on the popularity of Formula 1, The Movie, the Company introduced a limited-edition sandwich and collectible race cars, exclusive to McDonald's restaurants. The campaign was extremely successful, selling out in just a matter of days or weeks, in each market.\nFinally, given the increasingly competitive nature of the dessert category, the Company remained committed to keeping its menu at an affordable price and brought innovation to its dessert platform by leveraging a favorite McDonald's character with the Grimace Shake and by adding more local flavors to its McFlurry offerings.\nAdjusted EBITDA declined in US dollars mainly due to margin pressure in Brazil from higher beef costs this year and a reduction of labor contingencies in the prior year. Excluding the reduction of labor contingencies, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA rose 7.1% and Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 40 basis points versus the prior year period. Efficiencies in Payroll (excluding the labor contingency reduction in Brazil from the 2Q24) and Occupancy and other operating expenses, mainly in Brazil and SLAD, were offset by the abovementioned Food & Paper cost pressures.\nNet income attributable to the Company totaled $22.6 million in the second quarter of 2025, which represented a net income margin of 2.0%. The decrease in comparison with the prior year quarter was mainly explained by a lower reported Adjusted EBITDA margin and reduced non-cash foreign exchange results.\nArcos Dorados recorded earnings of $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2025 compared to $0.13 per share in the prior year period. Total weighted average shares amounted to 210,663,057 in the second quarter compared to 210,660,444 in the prior year's quarter.\nNotable items in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation\nIncluded in Adjusted EBITDA: Brazil's result in the second quarter of 2024 included a $16.0 million positive impact from the reduction of labor contingencies due to a favorable judgement.\nAdditionally, Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025 included a $6.9 million gain in Mexico and the second quarter of 2024 included a $4.2 million gain in Chile, both related to restaurant transactions with sub-franchisees in those markets.\nExcluded from Adjusted EBITDA: there were no notable items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA in either the second quarter of 2025 or the second quarter of 2024.\nNew Unit Development: Total and by Format1\n| Figure 2 | |||||\nJun. 30,\n|\nMar. 31,\n|\nDec. 31,\n|\nSep. 30,\n|\nJun. 30,\n|\n|\n| Brazil | 1,191 |\n1,179 |\n1,173 |\n1,160 |\n1,150 |\n| NOLAD | 658 |\n657 |\n654 |\n649 |\n649 |\n| SLAD | 608 |\n603 |\n601 |\n601 |\n596 |\n| TOTAL | 2,457 |\n2,439 |\n2,428 |\n2,410 |\n2,395 |\n| 1end of period, including company operated and franchised restaurants |\n| Figure 3 | ||||||||\n| as of Jun.30, 2025 |\nStore Format* |\nTotal\n|\nOwnership |\nMcCafes |\nDessert\n|\n|||\n| FS | IS | MS & FC |\nCompany\n|\nFranchised |\n||||\n| Brazil | 641 |\n91 |\n459 |\n1,191 |\n734 |\n457 |\n160 |\n2,021 |\n| NOLAD | 416 |\n47 |\n195 |\n658 |\n512 |\n146 |\n19 |\n520 |\n| SLAD | 267 |\n124 |\n217 |\n608 |\n509 |\n99 |\n227 |\n740 |\n| TOTAL | 1,324 |\n262 |\n871 |\n2,457 |\n1,755 |\n702 |\n406 |\n3,281 |\n| *FS: Freestanding; IS: In-Store; MS: Mall Store; FC: Food Court. |\nArcos Dorados added 20 new EOTF restaurants to the Company's footprint, including 18 free-standing units, in the second quarter of 2025. As of the end of June 2025, there were 1,732 EOTF restaurants in Arcos Dorados' footprint, making up 70% of its restaurant portfolio.\nConsolidated Debt and Financial Ratios\nFigure 4 |\n||\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except ratios) |\n||\n| June 30, | December 31, | |\n2025 |\n2024 |\n|\n| Total Cash & cash equivalents (i) | 233,862 |\n138,593 |\n| Total Financial Debt (ii) | 914,849 |\n699,851 |\n| Net Financial Debt (iii) | 680,987 |\n561,258 |\n| LTM Adjusted EBITDA | 473,773 |\n500,100 |\n| Total Financial Debt / LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio | 1.9 |\n1.4 |\n| Net Financial Debt / LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio | 1.4 |\n1.1 |\n| LTM Net income attributable to AD | 130,135 |\n148,759 |\n| Total Financial Debt / LTM Net income attributable to AD ratio | 7.0 |\n4.7 |\n| Net Financial Debt / LTM Net income attributable to AD ratio | 5.2 |\n3.8 |\n(i) |\nTotal cash & cash equivalents include short-term investment. |\n| (ii) | Total financial debt includes short-term debt, long-term debt and derivative instruments (including the asset portion of derivatives amounting to $68.0 million and $80.3 million as a reduction of financial debt as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively). |\n| (iii) | Net financial debt equals total financial debt less total cash & cash equivalents. |\nThe Company's net debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio ended the second quarter at a comfortable 1.4x, up from 1.1x at year-end 2024.\nFor the six-month period ended June 30, 2025, the net cash provided by operating activities totaled $57.7 million with total property and equipment expenditures of $104.2 million.

In order to access the webcast, members of the investment community should follow this link: Arcos Dorados Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Webcast.\nA replay of the webcast will be available later today in the investor section of the Company's website: https://ir.arcosdorados.com/.\nDefinitions\nIn analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP including: Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency basis, Systemwide sales, and Systemwide comparable sales growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA: In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with the general accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release and the accompanying tables use a non-GAAP financial measure titled \u2018Adjusted EBITDA'. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as the Company's operating income plus depreciation and amortization plus/minus the following losses/gains: gains from sale or insurance recovery of property and equipment, write-offs of long-lived assets, and impairment of long-lived assets.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDA facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations such as capital structures (affecting net interest expense and other financing results), taxation (affecting income tax expense) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense), which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Figure 5 of this earnings release includes a reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA. For more information, please see Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation in Note 9 \u2013 Segment and geographic information \u2013 of our financial statements (6-K Form) filed today with the S.E.C.\nConstant Currency basis: refers to amounts calculated using the same exchange rate over the periods under comparison to remove the effects of currency fluctuations from this trend analysis. To better discern underlying business trends, this release uses non-GAAP financial measures that segregate year-over-year growth into two categories: (i) currency translation and (ii) constant currency growth. (i) Currency translation reflects the impact on growth of the appreciation or depreciation of the local currencies in which the Company conducts its business against the US dollar (the currency in which the Company's financial statements are prepared). (ii) Constant currency growth reflects the underlying growth of the business excluding the effect from currency translation. The Company also calculates variations as a percentage in constant currency, which are also considered to be non-GAAP measures, to provide a more meaningful analysis of its business by identifying the underlying business trends, without distortion from the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.\nSystemwide sales: Systemwide sales represent measures for both Company-operated and sub-franchised restaurants. While sales by sub-franchisees are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding its financial performance because these sales are the basis on which it calculates and records sub-franchised restaurant revenues and are indicative of the financial health of its sub-franchisee base.\nSystemwide comparable sales growth: this non-GAAP measure, refers to the change, on a constant currency basis, in Company-operated and sub-franchised restaurant sales in one period from a comparable period for restaurants that have been open for thirteen months or longer (year-over-year basis) including those temporarily closed. Management believes it is a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and is indicative of the success of the Company's initiatives as well as local economic, competitive and consumer trends. Sales by sub-franchisees are not recorded as revenues by the Company.\nAbout Arcos Dorados\nArcos Dorados is the world's largest independent McDonald's franchisee, operating the largest quick service restaurant chain in Latin America and the Caribbean. It has the exclusive right to own, operate and grant franchises of McDonald's restaurants in 21 Latin American and Caribbean countries and territories with more than 2,400 restaurants, operated by the Company or by its sub-franchisees, that together employ more than 100 thousand people (as of 06/30/2025).

  "argos_summary": "Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. reported second-quarter earnings of 11 cents per share, surpassing analyst expectations of 7 cents, with total sales reaching $1.142 billion, a 2.8% increase year-over-year. The company experienced a 12.1% rise in systemwide comparable sales, driven by a 7.9% increase in digital channel sales, which accounted for over 60% of total sales. However, adjusted EBITDA declined to $110.1 million due to margin pressures in Brazil from rising beef costs, leading to a contraction in the adjusted EBITDA margin from 10.7% to 9.6%.",
