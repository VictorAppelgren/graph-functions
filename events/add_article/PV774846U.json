      "summary": "Swiss consumer prices rose 0.2% year‑on‑year in August, the third straight month above zero, easing pressure on the SNB to cut rates. The central bank’s policy rate is already at zero and is expected to stay unchanged through next year, with a negative rate only if conditions shift sharply. Weakening of the franc and high U.S. tariffs could lift import prices, adding uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Meanwhile, euro‑area inflation remains higher at 2.1%.",
