  "description": "Here are the seven best new movies streaming on Netflix in August 2025, including \"Clueless,\" \"Groundhog Day\" and \"Jurassic Park.\"",
  "content": "Netflix\u2019s August film slate includes originals like \u201cMy Oxford Year,\u201d \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club\u201d and \u201cFixed.\u201d Those are not the streaming service\u2019s only new additions this month, though. Netflix has also added a diverse batch of existing film classics to its library in August, including the hangout comedy to end all hangout comedies and the movie that finally landed one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest directors his first, long overdue Oscar.\n\nHere are TheWrap\u2019s picks for some of the best movies that have started streaming on Netflix in August.\n\u2022 None The 7 Best New Movies Streaming on Netflix in August\n\u2022 None All the \u2018Peter Pan\u2019 Connections in \u2018Alien: Earth,\u2019 Explained: Wendy, Neverland and Lost Boys\n\u2022 None \u2018Nobody Wants This\u2019 Season 2 First Look Shows Kristen Bell and Adam Brody Securely Snuggled Up\n\u2022 None \u2018Miss Governor\u2019 Cast and Character Guide: Who\u2019s Who in Tyler Perry\u2019s Netflix Comedy?\n\n\u201cClueless,\u201d director Amy Heckerling\u2019s clever, endlessly quotable adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cEmma,\u201d is one of the most beloved comedies of the 1990s for a reason. Set in mid-\u201990s Southern California, the film features a host of memorable performances \u2014 namely, those given by its three female leads, Alicia Silverstone, Stacey Dash and Brittany Murphy.\n\nBreezy and practically overflowing with confidence, \u201cClueless\u201d is a comedy that manages to poke fun at its characters and satirize their lives while also embracing and celebrating their youthful optimism and well-intentioned naivet\u00e9. It knows how to both love its characters and laugh at them, and if you want to know why it is often regarded as one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest teen films, that is just one of the reasons.\n\nNetflix is not lacking when it comes to films and TV shows suitable for the whole family. This month, though, the streaming service has added a contemporary family-friendly classic to its platform in 2010\u2019s \u201cDespicable Me.\u201d Starring Steve Carell as Gru, a supervillain with an army of yellow-skinned henchmen, the film launched an entire, multimedia franchise that is still alive and kicking 15 years later.\n\nHowever, none of its sequels or spin-offs have been able to truly match the original\u2019s imaginative creativity or charmingly ridiculous spirit. Carell\u2019s vocal performance as Gru has reached iconic status at this point, and all it takes is revisiting \u201cDespicable Me\u201d one time to remember why moviegoers fell so in love with the character \u2014 and his many minions \u2014 back in 2010.\n\nWriter-director Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d is a love letter to the 1970s, friendship, young love and youth itself. Set in 1976, the film follows an ensemble of high school and middle school students in Austin, Texas, as they cross paths, haze, hang out and fall in love with each other over the course of just one day. Featuring memorable performances from then unknown, up-and-coming stars like Ben Affleck, Milla Jovovich, Parker Posey and Matthew McConaughey, \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d is a memory piece overflowing with distinct, lived-in characters, moments and details.\n\nIt\u2019s a coming-of-age film about an era that now sits in the distant past and thus fittingly captures the momentary, impermanent nature of school, youth and, well, everything. In a world where nothing seems to last forever, though, the magic of \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d remains unwavering and undying.\n\nIt\u2019s hilarious. It\u2019s thrilling. It\u2019s absurdly violent. It\u2019s the film that finally netted director Martin Scorsese his first and only Oscar to date. It\u2019s \u201cThe Departed.\u201d\n\nA remake of the 2002 Hong Kong crime drama \u201cInfernal Affairs,\u201d Scorsese\u2019s film follows an assortment of police officers and gangsters as the tensions between them are gradually stoked by a cop pretending to be a gangster (Leonardo DiCaprio) and a gangster pretending to be a cop (Matt Damon). Tightly paced even at 151 minutes long, \u201cThe Departed\u201d is an explosive, relentlessly violent film that refuses to pull a single punch.\n\nIt will make your heart race and your jaw drop, and it will do all of that even before it reaches its deranged, maniacal gut-punch of a third act.\n\nDespite spawning countless, inferior imitators and popularizing the time-loop genre, \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d has truly stood the test of time. Co-written by Danny Rubin and director Harold Ramis, the film\u2019s story of a narcissistic weatherman (Bill Murray) who finds himself stuck in an unending, seemingly inescapable time loop has lost none of its comedic, romantic or dramatic power in the 32 years since it first hit theaters.\n\nThat is due, in no small part, to the brilliance of the lead performance given by Bill Murray, who is so perfectly cast as the film\u2019s cynical protagonist that it is impossible to imagine any other actor playing the role. Behind the camera, though, it is Ramis who finds the right balance of observational, deeply human humor and fantastical comedy. In doing so, he ensured that audiences could connect to \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d in spite of its ridiculous premise, and moviegoers have continued to love it for well over three decades now.\n\nFew movies inspire pure wonder as powerfully as \u201cJurassic Park\u201d does. Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1993 adaptation of the Michael Crichton novel of the same name is a maximalist sci-fi thriller about reckless technological advancement and the danger of human arrogance. It is one of the most beloved and revered films that Spielberg has ever made, and its release in the same year as the filmmaker\u2019s Best Picture-winning \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d cemented him as one of the most formidable and capable directors that Hollywood has ever seen.\n\n\u201cJurassic Park\u201d is part monster movie, part coming-of-age adventure, part family drama and part action epic, and it all just works. The film\u2019s sequels have been chasing its greatness for the past 30 years. While some have come close, none have managed to find the same, potent combination of awe-inspiring technical brilliance and cinematic artistry that makes \u201cJurassic Park\u201d one of Hollywood\u2019s signature blockbusters.\n\nThe \u201cFast and Furious\u201d series has emerged over the past 24 years as one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest franchises, and it still has not yet reached its conclusion. While the series has produced a handful of memorable entries, 2011\u2019s \u201cFast Five\u201d remains the most rightly revered and beloved. This heist-centric installment not only introduces Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Luke Hobbs, but it also marks the moment when the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d franchise began to focus more on its now-signature, physics-defying set pieces.\n\nThe resulting effect was a jolt of renewed life that the franchise has been riding the high of ever since. As entertaining as \u201cFast & Furious 6,\u201d \u201cFurious 7\u201d and \u2014 to a lesser extent \u2014 \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d all are, though, \u201cFast Five\u201d still hits harder than any other film that the franchise has produced up to this point. It\u2019s an exhilarating slice of pulpy blockbuster filmmaking that does not take itself too seriously, even as it delivers one cheer-worthy vehicular stunt and fistfight after another.\n\nThe post The 7 Best New Movies Streaming on Netflix in August appeared first on TheWrap.",
