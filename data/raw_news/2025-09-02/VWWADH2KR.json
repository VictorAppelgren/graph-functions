  "title": "Brighton\u2019s 2025 summer transfer window review: Another big sale, but are they now underpowered?",
  "description": "The club stuck to their usual model by parting with Joao Pedro for big money but there was no direct replacement signed",
  "content": "Is this the season Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s proven record of absorbing the sales of top performers during the summer transfer window yet still progressing via cute recruitment and forward-planning finally buckles? Or have they pulled it off once again?\n\nJoao Pedro\u2019s name has now been added to a list which includes those of Yves Bissouma, Marc Cucurella, Moises Caicedo, Alexis Mac Allister and Pascal Gross; players Brighton signed, developed, then flipped for a huge profit.\n\nHere, The Athletic analyses whether or not the business Brighton have done this summer can achieve the combined goals of strengthening other departments while also compensating for the loss of an attacking spearhead.\n\nSum up their window in 20 words or less\u2026\n\nA game of two halves. Ins done by early July, outs from then on to achieve a necessary squad-size reduction.\n\nHow much did they spend and how much did they bring in?\n\nIt is difficult to be precise in these matters. Selling clubs customarily inflate figures (including all the potential add-ons in the released number), buying teams deflate them \u2014 in both cases to make themselves look as shrewd as possible. Loan fees (often undisclosed) are also commonplace now. For example, Facundo Buonanotte\u2019s move to Chelsea includes a \u00a32million payment to rent him for the remainder of the season. There are also contract lengths and wages to take into consideration for a precise reflection of costs.\n\nSo, bear in mind these are ballpark figures based on transfer fees.\n\nBrighton\u2019s total outlay on their five signings is around \u00a370million. That sum is almost covered by Joao Pedro\u2019s move to Chelsea, which could reach \u00a360m if the add-ons are achieved. The departures, excluding loan options and obligations attached to some of the deals, have raised approximately \u00a3115m. It all adds up to a tidy profit on their summer trading after the unprecedented and one-off spend of nearly \u00a3200m on nine signings this time last year.\n\nWas this window a success or a failure?\n\nThis is impossible to call until more is seen of the new signings playing in the Premier League.\n\nLeft-back Maxim De Cuyper has started all three games and looks a sound investment (around \u00a317million from Club Brugge) on the early evidence. Central defender Diego Coppola came on for the closing stages of Sunday\u2019s 2-1 home win against Manchester City. But centre-back Olivier Boscagli, winger Tommy Watson and striker Charalampos Kostoulas have not had any league minutes so far.\n\nWill the head coach/manager be happy?\n\nFabian Hurzeler will be happy that the window has closed until January, so he now has clarity over the make-up of his squad. He was uncomfortable with too many fringe players becoming frustrated by a lack of game time, with an accompanying negative impact on unity. That accounts for the cutting-down of the group during the second half of the summer.\n\nHe will also be delighted to still have Carlos Baleba in midfield \u2014 despite Manchester United\u2019s interest \u2014 and Kaoru Mitoma on the left wing for his second season in charge. They are Brighton\u2019s stars now Joao Pedro has gone.\n\nBoscagli. He is the type of signing which highlights a team\u2019s attention to detail in looking to achieve marginal gains when they are competing against many clubs who have greater financial muscle. Brighton wanted to buy him last summer but bided their time when PSV stood firm and signed him as a free agent instead. Now they have a 27-year-old who possesses a good pedigree and is at a peak age for a central defender.\n\nThe former France Under-21 international Boscagli arrives as a back-to-back Eredivisie winner, bringing experience in European club competitions, pace and poise in possession, all for nothing \u2014 apart from his salary, obviously \u2014 in an area of the squad that needed strengthening, with Brighton\u2019s long-serving captain Lewis Dunk turning 34 years of age in November.\n\nDid they lose anyone they would have wanted to keep?\n\nJoao Pedro, in an ideal world. The versatile, high-quality Brazilian contributed 30 goals in 70 appearances across his two seasons with Brighton and was pretty much nailed on to score from the penalty spot (he converted 15 out of 16 for the club).\n\nBut this is not an ideal world.\n\nThe red card at Brentford towards the end of last season that proved costly in terms of European qualification, the subsequent training-ground spat with team-mate Jan Paul van Hecke and his burning desire to leave once Chelsea came calling all added up to an inevitable parting of the ways for a fair price.\n\nWhat will be their priority for January?\n\nBrighton dislike doing significant business, in or out, during the much shorter mid-season window. It smacks of panic, and their owner-chairman Tony Bloom never panics. Signings tend to be made with further into the future in mind than the second half of a campaign \u2014 striker prospect Stefanos Tzimas, bought from Nurnberg in a \u00a320million deal at the end of this year\u2019s winter window then immediately loaned back to them for the rest of the season, is a good example.\n\nThe priority will be to keep hold of their best players, especially if there is interest again in Baleba or Mitoma \u2014 they rejected bids of \u00a354million and \u00a361m from Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr for the latter during that same mid-season window.\n\nWill there be money to spend in that window?\n\nDefinitely, if deemed necessary. There is zero chance of Brighton falling foul of the league\u2019s profit and sustainability rules (PSR) under Bloom; their combined pre-tax profit over the past two seasons was over \u00a3200million.\n\nBrighton will always be Bloom\u2019s first and biggest love, even though he has financial stakes in Belgium\u2019s Union Saint-Gilloise, Heart of Midlothian in Scotland and Australian side Melbourne Victory as part of an expanding football empire.\n\nCan they achieve their goals for the season?\n\nPushing for European qualification after last season\u2019s eighth-placed finish (four points adrift of Nottingham Forest, who have ended up in the second-tier Europa League) and for the club\u2019s first major domestic silverware in the Carabao Cup or FA Cup depends largely on replacing Joao Pedro\u2019s goals. The idea is that goalscoring will be a collective effort from Hurzeler\u2019s forward options, rather than being a job for one or two individuals. Attention will focus, however, on how the combined \u00a350million spent on Greek youngsters Tzimas and Kostoulas pans out.\n\nIt will also be crucial not to lose key players for any length of time after last season\u2019s dreadful luck with injuries, particularly Mitoma or their \u00a340million record-buy Georginio Rutter.\n\nWhat is their strongest XI?\n\nSubject to change as the season progresses but, based on the flimsy evidence of the three matches so far and the potential of players in their first or second years at the club to emerge and shine, I\u2019ll plump for this in Hurzeler\u2019s go-to 4-2-3-1 shape: Bart Verbruggen; Joel Veltman, Van Hecke, Boscagli, De Cuyper; Baleba, Yasin Ayari; Yankuba Minteh, Brajan Gruda, Mitoma; Rutter.\n\nThat is especially harsh on Dunk, Danny Welbeck, Jack Hinshelwood and Mats Wieffer, but football is a squad game now more than ever, so everyone will have a part to play over the coming months. That has never been better demonstrated than in the quadruple substitution by Hurzeler after an hour against City at the weekend which transformed the match.",

      "text": "Brighton & Hove Albion have spent upwards of \u00a350million ($67m) this year on two Greek teenagers that play in the same position in the front line.\nSo, can Charalampos Kostoulas (left in top image) and Stefanos Tzimas (right) feature together in the starting line-up, or will head coach Fabian Hurzeler be choosing between them next season?\nAdvertisement\nThere are parallels between the Greece Under-21 team-mates in terms of their rapid rises, value and goalscoring. Kostoulas, 18, joins Brighton from Olympiacos on July 1 for \u20ac35m (\u00a329.6m; $40.2m) plus \u20ac2m in add-ons. That is more than the fee of \u00a320m plus add-ons paid for 19-year-old Tzimas from German club Nurnberg at the end of the January transfer window.\nKostoulas contributed seven goals and two assists in 30 appearances in the Greek Super League (which Olympiacos won) and the Europa League last season (Olympiacos lost 4-2 on aggregate to Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in the last 16 of the competition).\nTzimas\u2019s output was higher in the 2024-25 campaign \u2014 12 goals and three assists in 23 outings \u2014 albeit at a lower level in Germany\u2019s second tier. Nurnberg signed Tzimas initially on loan from PAOK in his homeland before exploiting a buy option in the deal and then selling to Brighton.\nBoth players are predominantly right-footed finishers, around 6ft (183cm) tall and have agreed contracts with Brighton until 2030.\nBut enough with the similarities, how are they different?\n\u201cWe play the same position, but I think we have different characteristics,\u201d said Kostoulas, speaking to the club website last week after his signing was announced. \u201cHe (Tzimas) is fast, he is strong, he is very smart on the pitch and off it. He is hanging around the goal every time. He wants to finish the actions, he wants to score.\u201d\nTzimas showed his poaching instincts when he scored for Nurnberg against Hannover in March (see clips below). When a shot from Janis Antiste deflected off Hannover goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler onto the crossbar, Tzimas reacted fastest to head in the loose ball from close range.\nThe next set of clips shows how Tzimas pounced in a similar fashion against Karlsruher in January. He was ready to pick up the pieces when Julian Justvan had a shot parried by the visitors\u2019 goalkeeper, Max Weiss.\nTzimas controlled the ball with his knee and scored with a looping header.\nTzimas also showed the attributes of a No 9 when he was on target in March against Greuther Furth. He makes a run infield in anticipation of a pass developing into an opportunity.\nThe failure of a Greuther defender to cut out the pass left Tzimas running into space one-on-one with the goalkeeper.\nHe opened up his body to slot the ball past the advancing Nahuel Noll with his trusty right foot.\n\u201cThe biggest difference is that Tzimas is an out-and-out No 9,\u201d Greek football writer and podcaster Stephen Kountourou tells The Athletic. \u201cKostoulas, meanwhile, can play anywhere in the attacking line and definitely feels more like a spiritual successor to Joao Pedro, if the Brazilian forward does leave this summer.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe versatility of Kostoulas is highlighted by the different types of goals he has scored for Olympiacos, operating in different areas of the pitch. In the clips below, he came off the bench against rivals Panathinaikos to make a darting run that caught the visiting defence flat-footed as he headed in a free kick from Brazilian Rodinei, sealing a 4-2 victory.\nKostoulas did all the work himself in a home game against Aris Thessaloniki in November. He pressed voraciously as the visitors passed the ball in a triangle near the halfway line.\nKostoulas wins the ball in a tackle and makes progress towards the penalty area, evading a challenge from an Aris defender.\nOnce he is inside the penalty area, he shows composure to equalise with a right-footed shot into the far corner. Kostoulas went on to snatch the points in the same game with a 96th-minute header.\n6ft\nIn the final set of clips, against Volos in December, Kostoulas points to where he wants the pass as he makes a diagonal run across the central defender 30 yards from goal.\nHe shifts the ball with his left foot back onto his favoured right foot to plant a low shot past Volos goalkeeper Daniel Kovacs, who is fooled into thinking he is aiming for the opposite side of the net.\nKostoulas has scored five goals in 15 appearances representing Greece in age groups from under-16 to under-21. Tzimas has netted 16 times in 32 outings across the same range of age groups. They are tipped in their homeland to soon be making senior appearances at international level.\n\u201cBoth are explosive players when it comes to running,\u201d says Kountourou. \u201cBoth are good physically and seem not to shy away from worrying about scoring when it comes to the big moments, because they know they are still young and they have the time to develop. In short, they aren\u2019t afraid to make those mistakes, because they will try and try again.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe striker options are currently in a state of flux for Hurzeler next season, amid doubts over the futures of Joao Pedro, Julio Enciso and Evan Ferguson. Danny Welbeck and Georginio Rutter are respectively strong options for the No 9 and No 10 roles, while Brajan Gruda showed in the latter stages of last season as the injured Rutter\u2019s replacement that he can also be in the mix.\nThe additions of Kostoulas and Tzimas bring an intriguing dimension to Brighton\u2019s forward options for the 2025-26 campaign. Kostoulas said during his signing announcement: \u201cStefanos is my friend. He is a very good guy, a very good player. We had some discussion about here and I can\u2019t wait to play with him on the pitch.\u201d\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"

      "text": "Since the number of substitutions you can make in Premier League games was permanently increased to five for the 2022-23 season, quadruple changes have been a sight to behold.\nIt\u2019s understandably rare and feels like the basis of a trivia question \u2014 there have only been 37 examples of a Premier League team sending on four from their bench at once in that period.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, Fabian Hurzeler\u2019s introduction of James Milner, Yasin Ayari, Georginio Rutter and Brajan Gruda around the 60th minute on Sunday wasn\u2019t just a nice quirky factoid for the record books \u2014 it turned the tide in Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s 2-1 home win against Manchester City.\nCity were leading through Erling Haaland\u2019s first-half goal and had dominated the opening hour of the game. Their pressing often forced Brighton to go long, with the subsequent aerial duels being won by City defenders, and more importantly, Pep Guardiola\u2019s side were often in position to pick up the second balls from these moments, too.\nHurzeler\u2019s four substitutions at once didn\u2019t result in a change in Brighton\u2019s shape, and they also maintained their direct approach, but it became more effective after the changes \u2014 when goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen or one of his defensive colleagues went long, Brighton\u2019s front four were in better positions to win the second ball.\nIf play went wide, Rutter or Gruda doubled up with the winger on that side to apply more pressure on the City defenders in duels over these long balls and be in place to pick up the scraps.\nHere, Rutter chases Verbruggen\u2019s boot downfield and outbattles Matheus Nunes to regain possession, with Kaoru Mitoma in position to pick up the second ball.\nIn another example, Lewis Dunk plays a long pass into the space behind City\u2019s left-back, Rayan Ait-Nouri. Gruda attacks the space with the visitors\u2019 Abdukodir Khusanov following him, but the important movement comes from Yankuba Minteh, who is ahead of Ait-Nouri and so in a position to support his attacking midfielder.\nGruda controls the ball and plays it to Minteh, whose earlier movement distances him from Ait-Nouri, allowing him to dribble past the left-back\u2026\n\u2026 before also bypassing Rodri and narrowly missing the target with his shot.\nWhen Brighton played the long ball towards the centre, Mitoma moved infield and Gruda pushed forward to be ready for the second ball.\nAdvertisement\nIn this example, the Japan international\u2019s proximity to the action allows him to win possession, before Rodri tries to retrieve the ball and mistakenly passes it to Minteh.\nMinteh, Brighton\u2019s right-winger, is under no pressure because Gruda\u2019s earlier run in anticipation of the second ball forces Khusanov to defend the central space. Left free for a moment, Minteh has enough time to find Rutter, whose shot is saved by James Trafford.\nBrighton\u2019s continued direct approach and improvement in terms of winning second balls got them back into the match, and eventually led to their winning goal.\nIn the build-up below, left-back Maxim De Cuyper plays a long ball towards Mitoma just beyond halfway, with City\u2019s Rico Lewis in an advanced position to mark Ayari.\nJohn Stones moves over from central defence to cover for his right-back, but Ayari immediately pounces to win the second ball and head it on towards Rutter, who lays it off to Mitoma.\nThe domino effect of Lewis moving up to mark Ayari and Stones covering for him is that Gruda is left unmarked between Ait-Nouri and Ruben Dias, who has also been dragged out of position by Rutter.\nThe German midfielder attacks the acres of space in City\u2019s defence and Mitoma duly finds his run\u2026\n\u2026 before Gruda\u2019s dummy sits Trafford and Ait-Nouri on the floor, and he scores into an empty net.\nThe improvement in winning the second balls showed the impact of Brighton\u2019s four substitutions after an hour.\n\u201cIt was impressive in the second half regarding energy and intensity,\u201d said Hurzeler after the match. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best football game from us regarding the tactical solutions we found against City, but regarding intensity and energy, that\u2019s (the) benchmark.\u201d\nEarlier in his post-match press conference, Hurzeler was asked if the quadruple substitution was a change of tactics or just personnel. \u201cSometimes in football it\u2019s not about tactics, it\u2019s about understanding the profiles from the players,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding what you need, and in this moment we needed energy, intensity, and the belief to change the game.\n\u201cThe profiles from the players who came in, with James, Yasin, Gruda and Rutter, they all have different profiles. For example, Gruda and Rutter are very positive guys. They just enjoy playing together. Yasin is always the guy who has the belief to win games, James is the guy who brings energy and organisation into the group.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the profiles from the players, and what you need in the moment.\u201d\nBrighton\u2019s four-in, four-out change didn\u2019t alter their direct approach against City, but the fresh legs and different player profiles strengthened their ability to win second balls.\nThe vision of almost half a new outfield team coming on all at once is always striking, and this time it was effective, too."

      "text": "Brighton & Hove Albion have confirmed the signing of defender Maxim De Cuyper from Club Brugge on a five-year contract.\nBrighton sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The Athletic that the deal for the 24-year-old was worth \u20ac20million (\u00a317.3m) plus add-ons.\nDe Cuyper will join the team for the start of their pre-season training this weekend.\nAdvertisement\nThe Belgium international came through the youth sides of Club Brugge and has played 114 times since making his professional debut against Manchester United in the last 32 of the Europa League in 2020.\nLast season, the left-back made 54 appearances in all competitions as Club Brugge made it to the round of 16 in the Champions League.\n\u201cMaxim is a creative left-back who has great experience at Champions League level as well as in the domestic league,\u201d head coach Fabian Hurzeler said. \u201cHe has a great reputation for creativity and has shown his ability across different positions, although we primarily see him challenging for a left-back spot with us.\n\u201cMaxim arrives having won the league and cup in recent years with Brugge, so it\u2019s great that despite his young age, he clearly has a winner\u2019s mentality. We\u2019re excited to work with him.\u201d\nDe Cuyper made his senior national debut in June 2024 after playing in Belgium\u2019s youth sides and has appeared ten times since, scoring three goals.\nThe left-back position at Brighton was occupied by several players last season as Pervis Estupinan missed games through injury. Jack Hinshelwood played a handful of matches there, but is right-footed and also spent time in central midfield, his favoured position.\nBrighton have also signed former PSV Eindhoven defender Olivier Boscagli in July to strengthen their back line.\n(Photo: Alex Bierens de Haan/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Midway through the second half of Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s 2-0 away defeat against Everton, a double substitution by Fabian Hurzeler raised an uncomfortable question: have they left themselves short up front after selling Joao Pedro to Chelsea earlier this summer?\nHead coach Hurzeler\u2019s side were two goals down on Sunday afternoon when he made straight swaps at left-back and in midfield, introducing Ferdi Kadioglu for Maxim De Cuyper and Diego Gomez for Yasin Ayari.\nAdvertisement\nThere was no out-and-out striker named on the bench \u2014 Brajan Gruda, who is a No 10 or right-winger, came on in the closing minutes \u2014 as an injury that ruled out Georginio Rutter left Hurzeler depending on Danny Welbeck. The 34-year-old former England international looked rusty in what was his first start of the season; Rutter had led the attack, with Welbeck a substitute, in the opening game \u2014 a 1-1 home draw against Fulham last Saturday.\nEx-Manchester United and Arsenal front man Welbeck missed a good chance to put Brighton ahead and silence the home support during the first half of Everton\u2019s first-ever league game at Hill Dickinson Stadium. He could not sort his feet out and his effort went over the crossbar although, in fairness, the cross from Yankuba Minteh was a little behind him when a yard in front would have made the opportunity far simpler.\nWelbeck, now Brighton\u2019s first-choice taker after Joao Pedro\u2019s \u00a350million-plus move to Chelsea in July, also had a poorly struck 74th-minute penalty saved by Jordan Pickford after Matt O\u2019Riley had converted from the spot to open the scoring against Fulham. Of far more concern than who should be on penalties \u2014 this was Welbeck\u2019s second failure in six career attempts \u2014 is the need to keep him and Rutter fit.\nDanny Welbeck\u2019s penalty is SAVED!\nBig moment for Jordan Pickford \ud83e\udde4 pic.twitter.com/8mL3B8JaEG\n\u2014 Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) August 24, 2025\nAnd for U.S. readers\nJordan Pickford DENIES Danny Welbeck from the penalty spot. \u274c pic.twitter.com/5vlDG8HvYc\n\u2014 NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) August 24, 2025\nA total of \u00a350million has been spent this year on Greek teenagers Stefanos Tzimas and Charalampos Kostoulas (\u00a320m on Kostoulas from Nurnberg in a winter-window deal that sent him back to the German side for the rest of last season, \u00a330m on Kostoulas from Olympiacos in June). But neither is deemed by Hurzeler to be ready for the Premier League yet.\nAdvertisement\nHurzeler spoke at his pre-match media session on Thursday about the importance of the youngsters getting \u201ctheir bodies adapted to the intensity of the Premier League\u201d after run-outs for Brighton\u2019s under-21 side. He is treading carefully in particular with Tzimas, who has suffered a leg muscle injury in the same area \u201ctwice or three times in a row\u201d, which the German said \u201ccreates doubts in a player\u201d.\nAs much as this approach makes sense, it places too much of a burden on Rutter and Welbeck being available. Hurzeler\u2019s team could be playing catch-up in the Premier League by the time Tzimas and Kostoulas are ready to increase the competition at the top end of the pitch, with Evan Ferguson having been loaned to Italy\u2019s Roma for the season and Julio Enciso in the process of signing for the BlueCo group that owns Chelsea and French top-flight side Strasbourg.\nBrighton should have at least four points, arguably six, after these first two games, not one. Having conceded a 96th-minute equaliser against Fulham, they were better than Everton yesterday and created the clearer chances \u2014 Kaoru Mitoma and Jan Paul van Hecke hit the woodwork in the first half, and O\u2019Riley should have scored when he latched onto a James Tarkowski backpass but was not decisive enough to beat Pickford.\nInstead, one point from the first two matches is Brighton\u2019s worst Premier League start since their 2017-18 debut season, when that first point came in the third game. With Manchester City up next at the Amex Stadium on Sunday, it is a tough environment for gaining momentum when the points tally is out of sync with performances.\nIf he\u2019d been fit, Rutter would have started again on Merseyside. \u201cYesterday, he had a small issue in training and, unfortunately, then we had to make the decision,\u201d Hurzeler told The Athletic during his press conference after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s only a small issue. I am sure that he will be back soon.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nRutter didn\u2019t play again last season after an ankle injury sustained in the FA Cup quarter-final defeat to Nottingham Forest near the end of March, and the absence of the imposing Frenchman arguably cost Hurzeler\u2019s side a place in Europe: they took only one point from the first four league games he missed on the run-in and finished eighth, four points behind Forest.\nWhile he can play as the No 9, Rutter is more of a handful as a marauding No 10 \u2014 he earned that penalty against Fulham with a powerful run from a relatively deep position.\nHurzeler told reporters in the run-up to the Everton match that his \u00a340million record signing from Leeds United last summer is a \u201cgreat connector\u201d who \u201cgives energy to everyone\u201d with his positive, always smiling persona.\nWelbeck can be relied upon when he is fully up to speed. But having been affected by injuries throughout his career, he played a limited part in the latter stages of Brighton\u2019s pre-season programme.\nHurzeler, asked whether he felt short of attacking options to get back into Sunday\u2019s game, where the visitors trailed 2-0 early in the second half after Iliman Ndiaye and James Garner found the net for Everton, told reporters: \u201cIf we scored the goals, we won\u2019t have this discussion. We created so many chances. Not only chances \u2014 big, big chances.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it, because it would only be an excuse if I said we missed a striker or did not have enough offensive opportunities to change (things). Overall, we created enough to win this game. We had enough chances to score. That\u2019s the main thing to take away, no matter how many options we had.\u201d\nFurther additions were not being ruled out before the Everton defeat. There will be no transfer-market panic from owner-chairman Tony Bloom before the summer window shuts a week today, but the issue of replacing Joao Pedro\u2019s 30 goals in 70 appearances, including 15 penalties, lingers.\n(Top photo: Welbeck apologises to the travelling Brighton fans after his tame penalty miss; Nick Potts/PA Images via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Brighton and Hove Albion head coach Fabian Hurzeler says the close of the summer transfer window on Monday evening will free Carlos Baleba from the \u201cnoise\u201d about his future.\nAs reported by The Athletic, Manchester United stepped back from their pursuit of the 21-year-old Cameroon midfielder earlier this month, due to Brighton\u2019s valuation of more than \u00a3100million.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that the window closes, that the noise stops, that he has a free head, that he can just focus on football,\u201d Hurzeler told The Athletic at his media briefing for today\u2019s game against Manchester City at the Amex Stadium.\n\u201cOf course, we try to give him the environment and the support where he can only focus on the pitch, but we are human beings. He\u2019s a human being. He\u2019s a very young human being. Unconsciously, there might be some noises in his head.\n\u201cSo, we need to give him the support he needs. We are sure that he will be here for us next season. We are sure that there is still some potential we need to get out of him. We need to improve him together and then I\u2019m sure that he will also play a great season for us again.\u201d\nBaleba did not complete 90 minutes in any of Brighton\u2019s first three games of the season after missing the majority of the pre-season programme through injury.\nHe played for 69 minutes in the 1-1 home draw against Fulham, was substituted at half-time by Hurzeler for tactical reasons in last Sunday\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Everton and came off the bench midway through the second half of Wednesday\u2019s 6-0 win at Oxford United in the Carabao Cup.\n\u201cI think he can play 90 minutes. I think it depends also on intensity,\u201d said Hurzeler. \u201cEvery game is a little bit different. Every game has different demands in the Premier League, but in general, it\u2019s a very high intensity.\n\u201cSo, we gave him a little bit more game minutes (at Oxford) where he has this competition in his body and he seems to be in good shape.\u201d\n(Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Before Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s final home game of last season against new champions Liverpool, Fabian Hurzeler spoke about what he felt they needed to be shopping for in his second summer transfer window as head coach.\n\u201cThe games just get more physical, more athletic, and that is where we have to take care also in our squad,\u201d Hurzeler told reporters. \u201cNo matter if it is someone in the last line \u2014 who might be full-back, centre-back \u2014 who has this physicality, or a No 6 (midfielder) who has this physicality.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt is not we have a lack in this or that position. It is more about: where do we get an add-on to our squad? Where do we see a potential player who can help us with physicality?\u201d\nThe recruitment department hope they have found that player with the signing of Diego Coppola from Verona of Italy\u2019s Serie A for \u20ac11million (\u00a39.4m/$12.7m), on a five-year contract.\nThe 21-year-old centre-half, 6ft 4in (193cm) tall, appears to epitomise Hurzeler\u2019s wish.\nSalvatore Bocchetti, who coached Coppola at Verona in their academy and as assistant manager of the first team, tells The Athletic: \u201cHe is physically strong and reads the game very well, but he is also surprisingly quick for his size, a combination that makes him very effective defensively.\u201d\nThe chart below, which compares a player\u2019s performance in key metrics with their positional peers across the top five domestic leagues in Europe, gives a good idea of Coppola\u2019s strengths. He is a towering presence in the air (aerial volume and aerial success), but also effective on the floor when making challenges against dribblers (one-v-one defending).\nThe low front-foot and back-foot defending metrics feel counterintuitive, but because Verona had so little of the ball last season while finishing 14th in 20-team Serie A (a league-worst 38.7 per cent), he was tasked with that responsibility more than most. Adjust for opportunity, and that effect dissipates slightly.\nUsing data from Opta via fbref.com, Coppola made the most interceptions in Europe\u2019s top five leagues last season (72), ahead of Sevilla\u2019s Jose Angel Carmona, Patrick Mainka of Heidenheim (both 68) and West Ham United\u2019s Aaron Wan-Bissaka (66), which highlights his powers of anticipation.\nIn possession, low returns for ball retention, pass progression and link-up play on The Athletic wheel chart above, with a high ranking for launched passes, reflect he was playing for a team who were more often than not under the cosh, losing 21 of their 38 league games and finishing with a minus-32 goal difference. They are all aspects of his game which are likely to improve at Brighton.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe is a strong player,\u201d says Bocchetti, a former Italy international centre-back during a playing career which included spells with Milan (on loan from Russian side Spartak Moscow), Genoa and Verona. \u201cHe is arriving in the best league in the world and joining a great club. I am sure, with his professional attitude and open mindset, that it will be easy for him to improve further. This is definitely a big step forward in his career.\u201d\nCoppola built his reputation as a committed defender as he rose through the ranks of Verona\u2019s academy.\nHe made his first-team debut in December 2021, shortly before his 18th birthday, and went on to make 85 appearances for the northern Italian club, scoring four goals. He was a regular last season, playing 34 times in the league as Verona successfully fought against relegation.\nHe had two years remaining on his contract when Brighton, after negotiations about the structure of the package, concluded a deal last week.\nCoppola\u2019s signing coincides with a significant step up in his international career.\nHe made his senior debut for Italy in the 3-0 World Cup qualifying defeat away to Norway earlier this month. That tough baptism up against Erling Haaland and company, playing next to Inter\u2019s Alessandro Bastoni on the left of a back three, was followed three days later by a late substitute appearance as Luciano Spalletti\u2019s reign as head coach ended with a 2-0 home win against Moldova.\nCoppola switched quickly from the seniors to representing the under-21s in the age group\u2019s ongoing European Championship finals in Slovakia. He played a full part in Italy\u2019s last two group matches, a 1-0 win against the host nation and a 1-1 draw with Spain. Carmine Nunziata\u2019s youngsters qualified for the knockout phase as runners-up behind the Spanish and faced Germany in the quarter-finals on Sunday.\nAdvertisement\nA hectic campaign came to a frustrating and exhausting conclusion for Coppola as Italy, reduced to nine men due to red cards for Leeds United winger Wilfried Gnonto and Mattia Zanotti towards the end of normal time, lost 3-2 after extra time.\nCoppola was a commanding figure in the middle of Italy\u2019s back three in a goalless first half against opponents featuring his now Brighton team-mate Brajan Gruda on the right of Germany\u2019s attack. He demonstrated his defensive discipline twice to repel threatening situations by blocking shots inside his own penalty area.\nBooked 11 times for Verona last season, he was fortunate not to receive an early caution when he kicked the ball further away into touch twice in the same action \u2014 he would surely have been shown a yellow card in the Premier League.\nCoppola was disappointed with Nick Woltemade\u2019s equalising header in the 68th minute for Germany. He was beaten in the air from a corner by the 6ft 6ins Stuttgart centre-forward, the top scorer in the tournament with five goals. But he recovered from that setback and, with socks rolled down in extra-time, stood out in Italy\u2019s rearguard action with resilient defending and reserves of energy. He slumped to the ground inside the box when Nathaniel Brown struck in the 117th minute to give Germany victory. On the plus side, Coppola gets a few extra days to rest and recover before joining his Brighton team-mates in July for pre-season.\nCoppola is used to playing in different defensive setups. He played on the right of a back four and in the centre of a three for the under-21s in those group games. At Verona, he featured both as the central pivot in a three-man defence and in a four. That type of adaptability will surely be useful for Hurzeler.\nThe move to the Premier League also provides Coppola with an opportunity to press his claims for further senior international recognition under Italy\u2019s new head coach Gennaro Gattuso as they try to qualify for next year\u2019s World Cup, having missed out in both 2018 and 2022. Hurzeler, returning to the theme of physicality in Coppola\u2019s signing announcement, said: \u201cHe is still young, he is tall, strong and mobile, and he will give us a real physical presence.\u201d\nBrighton saw off competition from among the big beasts of Italian football to sign Coppola. His move to the Premier League is not a surprise to Bocchetti. \u201cSome big Serie A clubs were also interested, but I think this is the best choice for him, and for Brighton too,\u201d Bocchetti says. \u201cI\u2019m very close to him, because I\u2019ve seen him grow. I have nothing but good things to say about him.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBrighton have picked the right player, both on and off the pitch. He\u2019s humble, very professional and, despite being young, he already has a strong personality thanks to his experience in Serie A. I am confident he is already studying to improve his English. He is a very committed and focused person.\u201d\n(Top photo: Image Photo Agency/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Brighton & Hove Albion head coach Fabian Hurzeler says he can tell from speaking to Charalampos Kostoulas that the \u00a330million summer signing is not yet ready to be thrown into action in the Premier League.\nBut there are no plans to loan out the 18-year-old Greek forward signed from Olympiacos or Tommy Watson, who joined from Sunderland for \u00a310m. The 19-year-old also had no minutes during pre-season after picking up an injury during the training camp in Spain in July.\nAdvertisement\nAsked by The Athletic about the state of play with the teenage newcomers, Hurzeler said: \u201cTommy had a small issue during the training camp. Nothing big, so he will be fine.\n\u201cBoth are in training. Both are training quite well. Regarding \u2018Babis\u2019 (Kostoulas), of course, there\u2019s a big spotlight on him because we spent \u00a330million. That\u2019s a huge amount of money, but I think it\u2019s very important to understand where he comes from.\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming from a different culture, a different league with different demands. And if you have talks with him, you can feel it, that he needs time to adapt to the intensity here. It\u2019s not only a different culture, it\u2019s also just a different adaptation for his body. So, how much sprint distance he has to do here during training, how much high-speed distance he has to do during training. It\u2019s something completely different. And the body just needs time, especially when you are that young.\u201d\nHurzeler, who was speaking to reporters on the eve of Brighton\u2019s first game of the 2025-26 season at home to Fulham on Saturday, added: \u201cYou need time to adapt, not only physically, but also in some ways mentally. Therefore, we need to give him the time and we need to be very patient with him, because I can say that he won\u2019t be immediately in the starting XI. He also might not be playing (against Fulham).\n\u201cThat\u2019s something everyone has to understand. Just because you pay that amount of money doesn\u2019t mean he immediately comes and plays from the beginning. The Premier League has different demands. We have a big squad, we have a very strong squad, so there\u2019s also a lot of competition in this position. So we all have to be patient.\n\u201cThat\u2019s our responsibility, to give him the environment where he can improve, where he can adapt, where he can be himself, but where he also gets challenged. Then he will adapt quite quickly and he will be an important player for us.\u201d\nBrighton intend to keep Kostoulas and Watson in house, rather than loaning them out. Hurzeler said: \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t think about that. The plan is that they try to adapt here as quickly as possible and be a help for us in the season.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBrighton were among the worst-hit clubs by injuries during the 2024-25 campaign, as they finished eighth in their first year under Hurzeler.\nThe 32-year-old German has a full squad to choose from with the exceptions of long-term absentees Adam Webster, who has undergone surgery on a anterior cruciate knee ligament rupture sustained during the training camp in Marbella, and Solly March. The long-serving winger had another operation towards the end of last season on the ruptured ACL which kept him out for 14 months from October 2023 to December 2024.\n(Top photo: James Boardman / BHAFC)"

      "text": "Tony Bloom did not occupy the seat set aside for the visiting chairman when Brighton & Hove Albion won 4-1 away to Tottenham Hotspur on the final day of the 2024-25 Premier League season.\nBrighton\u2019s long-serving owner-chairman was in Belgium for the weekend instead to witness a long-awaited triumph for Union Saint-Gilloise, the club he holds closest in his affections after his boyhood club, in an expanding football empire that also includes Heart of Midlothian in Scotland and Melbourne Victory in Australia.\nAdvertisement\nAbout 90 minutes after Fabian Hurzeler\u2019s first campaign as Brighton\u2019s head coach ended in north London with an eighth-placed finish in the club\u2019s eighth season in succession playing at that level, celebrations were under way in Brussels at the Joseph Marien Stadium as USG clinched their first domestic top-flight title for 90 years with a 3-1 home win against Gent.\nUSG\u2019s transformation has been remarkable since Bloom took over the club in 2018 alongside longtime friend and business associate Alex Muzio \u2014 they attended the same school in Hove and Muzio rose through Bloom\u2019s gambling consultancy company StarLizard.\nBack then, USG had narrowly avoided relegation to the third tier and they had not played in the top-flight Belgian Pro League since 1973. They were a shadow of the club that dominated Belgian football before the Second World War, finishing champions or runners-up 19 times before 1904 and 1935, before falling into decay and dropping down to the fourth division.\nSeven years on, they have been regular title contenders since promotion in 2020-21, reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League and the last 16 of the Conference League in successive seasons and, in 2024, won the Belgian Cup and Belgian Super Cup.\nMuzio, reflecting on USG\u2019s turnaround under the partnership with Bloom, tells The Athletic: \u201cWe looked at teams in a league we could realistically win without buying a large team. That made France and Holland difficult.\n\u201cBelgium has a deeper power base of teams than those countries, so, yes, it was always the plan. I wouldn\u2019t say Europe was a strong consideration, more something that would come with how good we hoped and planned to be in the long term. The work continues here. I\u2019m definitely not resting on my laurels.\u201d\nFor the first five years of the partnership, Bloom was the majority owner. Muzio held a 10 per cent stake and controlled the board voting rights. In July 2023, after Brighton reached Europe for the first time under former head coach Roberto De Zerbi to qualify for the Europa League, Bloom reduced his holding to a minority stake. Muzio remortgaged his house to acquire 75 per cent of the club. The ownership adjustment was made to comply with UEFA Competition Regulations around multi-club ownership as USG were also in the Europa League.\nAdvertisement\nPlayer movement from Brighton to USG used to be frequent \u2014 former players Percy Tau (in 2018-2019), Alex Cochrane (in 2020-21) and current star Kaoru Mitoma (in 2021-22) all had loans there. That has dissipated in line with the style of Bloom\u2019s multi-club model, with the clubs regarded as unconnected entities and personal ventures. There are, however, parallels in the smart recruitment of players and coaches to absorb churn.\nOn the playing side, striker Deniz Undav joined USG from the German third division, was sold to Brighton for \u20ac7million (\u00a35.8m; $7.6m) in January 2022 and is now a German international playing for Stuttgart, having been sold on by Brighton to the Bundesliga club in a deal worth \u00a328m last August.\nHurzeler is Brighton\u2019s fourth head coach/manager in seven seasons. USG have had the same number since 2022 \u2014 Felice Mazzu, Karel Geraerts, Alexander Blessin (Hurzeler\u2019s successor at St Pauli) and former Brighton defender Sebastien Pocognoli, who steered them to their 12th domestic title.\nHeart of Midlothian supporters are hopeful the success of USG, with Bloom\u2019s involvement, is a blueprint to restore former glories at the Scottish Premier League club, which is based in Edinburgh.\nAn extraordinary general meeting of shareholders at their Tynecastle Park home on June 18 will formally approve a \u00a39.86million investment by Bloom. It follows 98.5 per cent support for his proposal in a vote last month by the Foundation of Hearts (FoH), the fans group with 8,000 members that owns the club. In return, Bloom gets a 29 per cent stake but they are non-voting shares, and a place on the board will be taken by a nominee rather than Bloom himself.\nThe money is a personal investment by Bloom, with the aim of shaking up the Scottish football establishment. Glasgow sides Celtic and Rangers have dominated for decades. The last of the four top-flight league titles won by Hearts was in 1959-60. So how can he help to bridge the gap?\nAdvertisement\nIn a separate agreement, Bloom\u2019s data platform, Jamestown Analytics, will identify new signings for Derek McInnes. The former head coach of Aberdeen and Kilmarnock took charge last month as Hearts finished seventh of 12 teams in the league, a whopping 40 points behind champions Celtic and 23 points adrift of runners-up Rangers, under Steven Naismith in the early stages of the season and Neil Critchley for the majority of the campaign.\n\u201cWe think this is a game-changer, and we think this is something which can put us on a different level,\u201d said chair Gerry Mallon during an interview on FoH\u2019s YouTube channel in March. \u201cI think bringing somebody on board with the integrity, with the capability and of the calibre of Tony Bloom is a great coup for us.\u201d\nBloom has chosen aptly by buying into Melbourne Victory in the A-League in Australia \u2014 the home country of his wife Linda and a destination for regular family visits with their two children.\nHis purchase of a 19.1 per cent stake in the club in March was accompanied by memes on social media about Seagulls, Brighton\u2019s nickname. AAMI Park, Victory\u2019s home stadium, is renowned for being overrun by these coastal birds.\nVictory have a chequered financial history. They announced around the time of Bloom\u2019s investment that they are no longer owned by A-Cap. The U.S. insurance firm took control last year of the assets of 777Partners, the Miami-based investment company that made a failed attempt to add Everton to its portfolio of football clubs two years ago.\nVictory, A-League champions four times but not since 2014-15, posted a loss of \u00a34.8million ($6.2m) in 2023-24, so it is not surprising that Bloom\u2019s arrival on the scene has received an enthusiastic thumbs-up from supporters.\n\u201cThey were very pleased to see Tony Bloom come in because they knew of his reputation for incredibly well-run organisations,\u201d Australia football writer Joey Lynch tells The Athletic. \u201cIt was rumoured for a while and they were absolutely ecstatic when it was confirmed.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cA-League observers welcomed Tony Bloom into the fold as well. He is only a minority owner without a controlling stake, but he carries a reputation for good custodianship of his clubs in a league that desperately needs investment from fit and proper characters.\u201d\nBloom\u2019s joy with USG in Belgium in May contrasted with pain for Victory the following weekend as they lost 1-0 at home to rivals Melbourne City in the grand final that decides the A-League champions. They were also beaten in the 2023-24 final, suffering a 3-1 defeat against Central Coast Mariners. Bloom\u2019s expertise in player recruitment modelling is key to their plans.\n\u201cThe short-term hope for Melbourne Victory would be access to scouting and data analytics for recruitment, because the A-League operates with a salary cap,\u201d says Lynch. \u201cMelbourne are expected to sell or lose a lot of players during the off-season, as free agents or transfers.\n\u201cAll of those players need to be replaced in a salary-cap environment where you have a limited number of foreigners and, if you want to remain competitive year in and year out, you need smart recruitment. Victory have made the grand final to determine the champions two years in a row and they\u2019ve lost both times, so they need someone to help them take the next step.\u201d\nIf Bloom\u2019s record of success with Brighton and Union Saint-Gilloise is a dependable yardstick, Hearts and Melbourne Victory can both look forward to brighter futures.\n(Top photo: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images)"

      "text": "\u201cAt the beginning it was difficult with him,\u201d former Leicester City and Southampton manager Claude Puel tells The Athletic. \u201cWhen he lost the ball it was never his fault, it was always the fault of another player.\u201d\nBrighton & Hove Albion new boy Olivier Boscagli spent the first two years of his senior career playing under Puel at Nice.\nAdvertisement\nThe 27-year-old central defender, who has this week completed a free transfer move on the expiry of his contract with PSV, has shaken off the habit that so frustrated his first manager.\n\u201cI tried to correct it,\u201d says Puel. \u201cSince then, I saw him in different games with Eindhoven and he now has fantastic leadership, a calm quality.\n\u201cIt will not be a problem for him to adapt to the Premier League. He is a very good player. He has all the qualities needed.\u201d\nBoscagli\u2019s route to the Premier League \u2014 via his home country of France and the Netherlands \u2014 really took shape when Puel gave Boscagli his debut in Ligue 1 as a 17-year-old.\n\u201cHe was 15 and he played at Beausoleil, just a little town near Monaco,\u201d Puel tells The Athletic. \u201cI decided to sign him for Nice and, after two seasons in the academy I gave him some games in the first team, at the beginning at left-back and afterwards at centre-back. After I left, he continued to play.\n\u201cHe was very interesting technically with a very good left foot, capable of making long passes, with good control to pass and to start the play from the back. For a young player it was very interesting to see the possibilities, because I like technical players. After that he needed to progress to win duels, to anticipate situations, but the first thing was the quality of his control and to make the right pass at the right moment.\u201d\nPuel went on to manage Southampton (2016-17) and Leicester (2017-19) in the Premier League after leaving Nice. He has watched Boscagli mature into a player long admired by Brighton and finally captured as part of a defensive revamp for Fabian Hurzeler\u2019s second season in charge in 2025-26.\nAs is often the case with Brighton\u2019s recruitment, Boscagli had been a target in previous transfer windows. They stayed patient in waiting for the right moment to get a deal over the line.\nAdvertisement\nThey tried to sign Boscagli last summer, but PSV were determined to keep hold of him in pursuit of winning Eredivisie for a second consecutive season. In the end it worked out well for all parties.\nBoscagli made 30 appearances out of a possible 34 as PSV pipped Ajax to the domestic title by one point, a perfect end to his career in the Netherlands. His refusal to extend his contract meant Brighton have been able to land him without paying a transfer fee.\nBoscagli is a different type of player to Brighton\u2019s other new central defender, Diego Coppola, signed in June from Serie A side Hellas Verona for \u20ac11million (\u00a39.4m/$12.7m). Coppola is 6ft 4in (193cm) and his biggest strengths come into play without the ball \u2014 aerial and ground duels, and reading danger.\n\u201cHe is not the central defender everyone expected, because he is not so tall (5ft 11in; 181cm) and he is not so weighty,\u201d Dutch football writer Sander Berends, of ELF Voetbal, says of Boscagli. \u201cWhen you see him, he has the build of a winger more than a central defender, but he can jump so high, ridiculously high. He can score from attacking set pieces and in almost every defensive situation against taller strikers he wins the ball in the air. His timing is so good.\u201d\nThe percentile rank of Boscagli against other centre-backs in the Eredivisie in the chart below shows that he is sufficiently strong to win a fair percentage of ground and aerial duels, but it is his passing abilities that catch the eye. Even though it is easier to stand out in a naturally possession-dominant side such as PSV, it shows how comfortable he is to play in a high-possession team.\nIn the 2023-24 season, when PSV won the title by seven points ahead of Feyenoord, Boscagli completed more long passes than any other player in Europe\u2019s top seven divisions.\nAdvertisement\nHis quality on the ball was highlighted during a 4-1 home win against Heracles towards the end of last season. When Boscagli receives the ball inside his own half, he is scanning for a forward run by team-mate Ismael Saibari\u2026\nA lofted pass is perfectly placed and weighted over the head of the marking defender.\nSaibari, with a clear run on goal, overhits his lob onto the roof of the net but, out of nothing, Boscagli created a goal-scoring opportunity. Six league assists last season is an impressive number for a central defender.\nBoscagli took a rare step in moving from the top flight in France to the top flight in the Netherlands when he joined PSV from Nice in July 2019.\nBerends says: \u201cWhen he came, everyone thought, who is Olivier Boscagli? Because in Holland we see a lot of foreign football, but the French league is only small on Dutch television. Nobody had any expectations and in his first season you could see the Dutch league was new to him and he had to adapt to the situation.\n\u201cA lot of fans didn\u2019t know much about him and his first few matches were not good. After the first six months everyone thought, \u2018What a failure, what a mistake\u2019, when maybe there were better central defenders in Holland.\u201d\nAway from the pitch also it was a culture shock for Boscagli. He was born in Monte Carlo, the luxury haven of the wealthy in the principality of Monaco. \u201cIt\u2019s sometimes like living in two different worlds,\u201d he told the Brainport Eindhoven website. \u201cThere I saw the most expensive cars, the biggest boats and the most beautiful buildings every day. Everything there has to be special and just a little bit extra.\n\u201cHere, me and my wife enjoy life in quiet, green surroundings. I already had a couple of French offers when PSV came. It wasn\u2019t a difficult choice. It\u2019s not like I saw PSV play often, but everyone in France knows the club and its history. I could step outside my comfort zone.\u201d\nBoscagli\u2019s improvement at PSV was aided by multi-lingual team-mate Ibrahim Sangare and French-speaking Jordan Teze along with Peter Bosz, who replaced Ruud van Nistelrooy as manager in 2023. Bosz speaks fluent French following a spell with Toulon in his playing days.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhen he (Boscagli) came, he could only talk French and not a lot of people in Holland talk French,\u201d said Berends. \u201cHe learnt to speak English, so he understood more after that. Sangare, who comes from the Ivory Coast, but can also speak English, helped him.\u201d\nBoscagli\u2019s progress as the left-sided central defender in PSV\u2019s back four was threatened by a knee injury, which sidelined him for 10 months from April 2022 to February 2023. \u201cIn the period before that he was playing better and better after getting into the starting line-up,\u201d says Berends. \u201cWhen he returned from his injury he played very well after that for two seasons. He is also speedy. Most of the time he is faster over the ground than the opposing striker. It\u2019s a good combination \u2014 not as quick as Micky van de Ven (of Tottenham Hotspur) but still very quick.\u201d\nBoscagli will bring a different dimension to the central defender options for Hurzeler, currently comprising Coppola, reigning player of the season Jan Paul van Hecke, Lewis Dunk, Adam Webster, Igor Julio and January signing Eiran Cashin. Long-serving skipper Dunk, affected by injuries last season, is closing in on a one-year contract extension based on appearances. The futures of Webster and Igor in particular are unclear.\n\u201cHe can play very well with a central defender who is more physical,\u201d Berends adds of Boscagli. \u201cThat would be a perfect combination. A lot of the central defenders in the Premier League are closer to two metres (tall) with big shoulders.\n\u201cHe is a reverse of that, but if he plays with a typical Premier League player he can be very good.\u201d\nAdditional reporting: Mark Carey\nTop photo: Paul Hazlewood/BHAFC"

      "text": "Brighton & Hove Albion resemble a dog with a bone in pursuit of recruiting players they really like.\nThey sometimes end up signings players one or two transfer windows after targeting them, once the circumstances become suitable to the selling club.\nTommy Watson is a good example of their approach of patience combined with persistence. A deal worth \u00a310million ($13.2m) was finally agreed at the end of March for the 19-year-old Sunderland winger. Watson will officially become a Brighton player on a four-year contract when the summer window opens on June 1.\nAdvertisement\nIn the words of Sunderland\u2019s sporting director Kristjaan Speakman, Brighton have landed a bright prospect coveted by multiple Premier League clubs who they tried to get in the past two transfer windows \u2014 he travelled south for talks on deadline day in January, but there was no resolution.\nThe plan, according to a source granted anonymity to protect relationships, is for Watson to go straight into first-team reckoning next season as another attacking addition to a youthful squad, subject to what happens in pre-season under head coach Fabian Hurzeler.\nSunderland have negotiated a package that could reach eight figures for a player who has made only 11 senior starts in the Championship and who showed no desire to extend a contract due to expire next summer. It is a deal which has made everybody happy.\nWell, not everyone. Watson has been booed by some Sunderland supporters in a mixture of starts and substitute appearances since the signing was announced. A run of five defeats at the end of the regular season for Sunderland, entering the promotion play-offs against Coventry City, became a red rag to a bull for Watson\u2019s detractors, although the side managed by 49-year-old Frenchman Regis Le Bris were heading for the play-offs anyway prior to the downturn in results.\nWatson makes his farewell appearance at the Stadium of Light \u2014 if he gets on the pitch \u2014 in tonight\u2019s second leg against Coventry. Sunderland are well-placed to reach the play-off final at Wembley on May 24 after a 2-1 win in the first leg on Friday night, when Watson was an unused substitute.\nMichael Lough, from the Wise Men Say Sunderland podcast, told The Athletic: \u201cI think it\u2019s just a very unusual set of circumstances. There were murmurings on deadline day that the deal was all but done, but we couldn\u2019t get a replacement in time, so it was fair enough, the deal was cancelled.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe mood of the fan base is very polarised. Fans occasionally let emotion rule their heads a bit too much. When he comes on and plays for us, there is a smattering of boos, which is very unhelpful. I\u2019ve got to acknowledge there is a sizeable section of the fanbase that aren\u2019t too pleased about the manner in which it happened, but I think that is more about the timing of the news coming out, with still quite a few games left to play.\n\u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s a deal that suits all parties. To get \u00a310m for a player who, at the time of the deal going through, had made fewer than 20 senior appearances, is brilliant.\n\u201cFrom Brighton\u2019s point of view, spending \u00a310m on a player is a bit like us spending \u00a32m in the Championship. Sunderland have a great track record in youth development and they give players opportunities to the point where it doesn\u2019t feel unusual for Watson to have played so much when he was 18. He has gone to Brighton, who clearly value youth development and have it spot on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if he has left us to go to Manchester United, or somewhere like that, where there is not the clearest pathway. I think he is going somewhere which will be suitable for his long term development.\u201d\nWatson has been at Sunderland since the age of six, which increases the sense of loss to those grieving about his departure. He made his Championship debut as a late substitute in a 1-1 draw against Huddersfield Town ten days after his 17th birthday in April 2023 and a debut for England Under-18s six months later.\nThis season, Watson moved into the limelight with both goals in 2-1 home win against Stoke City in December, during a sequence of five starts in succession. Knee and ankle injuries sustained in the next match three days later, a 1-1 home draw against Bristol City, interrupted his momentum. He made 14 league appearances up to the point when the move to Brighton was announced. He has made six appearances, including four starts, since returning to contention in February.\nAdvertisement\nInternally, Sunderland have always thought a lot of Watson, which bodes well for Brighton\u2019s opinion of his potential. The Sunderland academy has a reputation as a high-quality production line, stretching back to Jordan Henderson and Jordan Pickford. Chris Rigg, 17, has been a regular in midfield in the current campaign with 23-year-old Dan Neil. Goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, 25, also came through the system.\nPlaying opportunities for Watson on the left flank has been hampered by stiff competition, initially from Jack Clarke before the \u00a31m signing from Tottenham Hotspur in 2022 was sold to then-Premier League newcomers Ipswich Town for \u00a316m last August. Romaine Mundle, another former Tottenham academy product, has obstructed the pathway as well since joining from Standard Liege in Belgium in the January 2024 transfer window.\nThere are similarities between Clarke and Watson in gait, dribbling style and appearance (socks rolled down, shirt untucked). \u201cHe\u2019s got quite a lanky build,\u201d said Lough. \u201cHe moves with the ball in a similar way, likes to cut inside. I watch a lot of the under-21 matches and when he broke through last season he was quite clearly a cut above, absolutely dominating games.\n\u201cHe is quite gangly, quite a direct runner with the ball, he likes to make things happen. He is a supremely confident character, one of those young players who, despite his youth, has a real aura about him. He certainly backs himself. I think he is an extremely talented player with a very high ceiling.\n\u201cHe is still a bit of an unknown quantity, which is why I think, \u00a310m is a good price, but from Brighton\u2019s point of view, with the money that is in the Premier League, I don\u2019t think it is excessive.\u201d\nGreek striker Stefanos Tzimas, 19, was captured by Brighton at the end of the winter window for a fee in excess of \u00a320m and loaned straight back to Nurnberg in Germany\u2019s second tier for the rest of the season. In March, the club announced the signing from July 1 of 18-year-old South Korean winger Yun Do-young from Daejeon Hana Citizen in his country\u2019s K1 League.\nBrighton\u2019s January and post-January transfer business tends to focus primarily on signing young players for what they regard as a fair price, with a lot of scope for improvement in performance and for growth in resale value. Watson is the latest talent to fit their model.\nAdditional reporting: Phil Buckingham\n(Top photo: Stu Forster/Getty Images)"

We don\u2019t have enough players, we have a (Club) World Cup at the end of the season. We have a lot of games. I think he can play more minutes. He has to continue to fight. At the same time, maybe an offer arrives and the club says we have to sell him.\n\u201cMy opinion of Macca, what I said to the club, is really clear. But the club has to take the resources and sell players, and it depends on what happens.\n\u201cOf course, I understand the frustration (of not playing). Absolutely, I was a football player and I have incredible empathy for what he feels. But the same happens for other players and they have to be ready.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody to be unsatisfied but in the middle of the season, with the problems we have, I have the feeling I need him, we need him, it\u2019s simple.\u201d\nIt was a busy day at Wrexham\nThere were two through the door at Wrexham yesterday, as they finished Friday by announcing the arrival of Jay Rodriguez from Burnley.\nThe acquisition of Rodriguez for an undisclosed fee takes Wrexham\u2019s tally of senior strikers to seven.

      "text": "Chelsea have confirmed the loan signing of Facundo Buonanotte from Brighton & Hove Albion.\nBuonanotte had appeared close to joining Leeds United on loan before Chelsea swooped for the 20-year-old last week.\nBuonanotte joined Brighton in January 2023 for a down payment of over \u00a35million from Argentinian side Rosario Central, and made 50 appearances in all competitions for the club across a season and a half.\nAdvertisement\nDespite only being a teenager at the time, only eight players featured more for Brighton in the 2023-24 season as they finished 11th.\nHe was loaned to Leicester City for the 2024-25 campaign and played 35 times before returning to Brighton. He registered six goals and three assists as they finished in 18th and were relegated.\nBuonanotte has made two senior international appearances for Argentina in friendlies, making his debut aged 18 after playing in their youth teams.\n\u2018Temporary move provides short-term cover\u2019\nAnalysis by Thom Harris\nBuonanotte was a bright spark on loan at Leicester last season, a lively attacking player who stood out for his quick feet and adventurous approach to the game in difficult circumstances towards the bottom of the Premier League.\nHe scored five goals in league football, only trailing Jamie Vardy, the pick of the bunch coming against Bournemouth after a slaloming run from the right and powerful finish at the near-post. Though a diminutive attacking midfielder, Buonanotte did not shy away from defensive work, attempting more tackles per 90 minutes than any other teammate.\nChelsea had to move on from RB Leipzig\u2019s Xavi Simons, who has signed for Tottenham Hotspur. They were evaluating a move for Barcelona\u2019s Fermin Lopez, but have since decided against a move. Buonanotte seems to be an alternative solution as Chelsea look to take some of the weight from Cole Palmer\u2019s shoulders, a player who can drift between the lines and receive passes to help move the team forward, while potentially keeping a space free for Kendry Paez after he returns from his loan spell at Strasbourg next year.\nAs always, Chelsea are spinning plenty of plates in the transfer market, but a temporary move for Buonanotte provides short-term cover in that No 10 position at a low cost, while the club monitor the progress of others.\n(Photo: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images)"

  "argos_summary": "Brighton\u2019s 2025 summer transfer window yielded a tidy profit of about \u00a3115m from sales, largely driven by Joao Pedro\u2019s \u00a360m move to Chelsea, while new signings cost roughly \u00a370m. The club\u2019s strategy of selling top performers and reinvesting in youth and depth\u2014such as Maxim De Cuyper, Diego Coppola, and the Greek teenagers Kostoulas and Tzimas\u2014has kept squad size manageable and maintained competitive balance. Head coach Fabian Hurzeler remains confident that the new recruits will fill gaps left by departures, though key players like Mitoma and Baleba are still under contract and unlikely to leave in January. The window closed with Brighton poised to challenge for European qualification, but the true test will come as the new signings gain Premier League experience over the season.",
