  "title": "'This is an emergency': 5 takeaways after Trump deploys troops in DC, takes over police",
  "description": "President Trump painted a dark picture of crime in the nation's capitol as he uses his executive authority to seize the city's police force",
  "content": "President Donald Trump laid out an aggressive plan for the federal government to take over law enforcement in Washington and teased that the same force might be coming to other cities across the country.\n\nJoined by top administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the president announced the National Guard will be deployed in the nation's capital and that the local police will be placed under federal control.\n\n\"This is an emergency,\" Trump said. \"This is a tragic emergency.\"\n\nThe president laid out a dark portrait of the city throughout an Aug. 11 press conference, describing it as overrun by homeless people, drug addicts and other \"bloodthirsty criminals\" that his administration will no longer tolerate.\n\nMany residents and activists have long resisted those characterizations as false and racially motivated attacks against the city, which has lobbied for statehood in recent years. Mayor Muriel Bowser, for instance, pushed back at the president's claims of rising crime over the weekend, saying residents \"are not experiencing a crime spike.\"\n\nBut Trump and his allies have been keen on spotlighting individual violent crimes against reporters, White House aides and congressional staffers that often seize headlines and startle tourists.\n\nDemocrats and other critics pointed out that Washington's homicide rate is down 32% year-to-date, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. They called Trump's move another abuse of his executive authority.\n\nHere are key takeaways from Trump's press conference.\n\nTrump signed two executive orders, the first invoking the 1973 Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume control of Washington police for 48 hours if they determine \"that special conditions of an emergency nature exist...\"\n\nSuch a takeover can be extended with congressional approval but any request of more than 30 days must be passed into law.\n\nIn a separate order, Trump ordered Hegseth to deploy National Guard troops in Washington, which also authorized him to work with governors of other states to utilize their guard as well.\n\nKey officials within the administration are now being tasked with overseeing DC's law enforcement agencies, including Bondi, who will take command of the local Metropolitan Police Department. Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Terry Cole, who was sworn in last month, will serve as interim federal commissioner of the police department.\n\nDuring the press conference, Trump sprinkled in many individual cases of violent crime that he argued justified his takeover, such as the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum.\n\nOne at the top of mind was the assault of Edward Coristine, who worked as a staffer with the Department of Government Efficiency. An Aug. 3 police report, obtained by USA TODAY, said officers observed a group of about 10 juveniles surrounding Coristine's car and assaulting him around 3 a.m.\n\n\"He was left dripping in blood,\" Trump said. \"He thought he was dead, with a broken nose and concussion. Can't believe that he's alive. He can't believe it.\"\n\nThe president also evoked Phillip Todd, a former aide to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who was stabbed in 2023. Trump described the attacker, identified by police as Glynn Neal, as a \"demented lunatic.\"\n\nIn an August profile by The Washington Post, Todd, a son of Christian missionaries, said that he had forgiven Neal and was rethinking his views on crime and punishment.\n\nChicago, other cities could see federal oversight, Trump warns\n\nWhile ticking off individual cases, Trump noted that his Washington takeover might be brought to cities including Chicago; Baltimore; Los Angeles and Oakland, California.\n\nThose Democratic-controlled cities and states, Trump said, have adopted left-leaning policies, such \"no cash bail\" rules, that he blamed for violent crime.\n\n\"This issue directly impacts the functioning of the federal government, and is a threat to America, really,\" he said. \"It's a threat to our country. We have other cities also that are bad, very bad.\"\n\nChicago was in the news earlier this summer for a historic drop in crime that Mayor Brandon Johnson, who Trump called out during the press conference, has touted.\n\n\"This reduction in hate crimes and of violence generally is a testament to what\u2019s possible when we invest in people and community safety in a holistic way,\" Johnson said in a July 18 statement that credited \"strategic, constitutional policing\" and \"jobs for young people, access to mental health care, and housing people can afford.\"\n\nSimilar trends have occurred in Baltimore, which has seen a 24% decrease in homicides and an 18% decline in nonfatal shootings, according to Mayor Brandon Scott.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, the Democratic Mayor's Association said federal intervention isn't needed and argued the president is looking to create a \"political charade\" to distract voters.\n\n\"Let's be clear: Crime is down in most major cities \u2212 including Washington, DC \u2212 in spite of Donald Trump, not because of him,\" the group said. \"If Trump actually cared about reducing crime, he wouldn't have made unprecedented cuts to public safety programs that actually work.\"\n\nCongress' takeover of Washington could come next\n\nTrump's crackdown in Washington could be followed by further changes, specifically to its home rule status, which is often a favorite punching bag for congressional Republicans.\n\nAhead of the president's press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, declared that now is the time for lawmakers to take control of the city.\n\n\"We should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,\u201d Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\n\nThe bill, dubbed \u201cBringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident\u201d was introduced earlier this year, and was named after Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption in the city.\n\nLee co-sponsored the measure with Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tennessee, and cited an ongoing scandal involving a Washington police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime.\n\nTrump appeared to allude to the Ogles-Lee proposal to rescind home rule. \"We're going to change the statue, and I'm going to have to get the Republicans to vote, because the Democrats are weak on crime,\" he said.\n\nDemocrat point fingers on DC statehood while others focus on Trump\n\nNational Democrats took a few swings at Trump's declaration, casting it as a political ploy more than a fight to improve public safety.\n\n\"The most violent cities are in Republican states \u2212 and there's no takeover happening there,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, a rumored 2028 presidential contender, said in a post on X. \"This is just another attempt to distract from Trump's corruption and suppress dissent.\"\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former Democratic vice presidential nominee, described Trump's announcement in stark terms, saying on X: \"The road to authoritarianism is littered with people telling you you\u2019re overreacting.\"\n\nBut some Democrats said the party failed to protect Washington when it had the chance four years ago when Joe Biden was still president and they ran Congress.\n\n\"Trump is going to federalize D.C.,\" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-California, said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\n\n\"Senate Dems could have stopped this when we had power,\" he added \"In 2021, the House voted to make D.C. a state, but a few Senate Dems flinched and genuflected to the filibuster. Now, DC will be under an aspiring dictator\u2019s control.\"",

      "text": "Exclusive: DOGE staffer, 'Big Balls', provided tech support to cybercrime ring, records show\nWILMINGTON, Delaware, March 26 (Reuters) - The best-known member of Elon Musk's U.S. DOGE Service team of technologists once provided support to a cybercrime gang that bragged about trafficking in stolen data and cyberstalking an FBI agent, according to digital records reviewed by Reuters.\nEdward Coristine is among the most visible members of the DOGE effort that has been given sweeping access to official networks as it attempts to radically downsize the U.S. government.\nPast reporting had focused on his youth - he is 19 - and his chosen nickname of \"bigballs,\" which became a pop culture punchline. Musk turned championed the teen on his social media site X, telling his followers last month that \"Big Balls is awesome.\"\nBeginning around 2022, while still in high school, Coristine ran a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services, according to corporate and digital records reviewed by Reuters and interviews with half a dozen former associates. Among its users was a website run by a ring of cybercriminals operating under the name \"EGodly,\" according to digital records preserved by the internet intelligence firm DomainTools and the online cybersecurity tool Any.Run.\nThe details of Coristine's connection to EGodly have not been previously reported.\nOn Feb. 15, 2023, EGodly thanked Coristine's company for its assistance in a post on the Telegram messaging app.\n\"We extend our gratitude to our valued partners DiamondCDN for generously providing us with their amazing DDoS protection and caching systems, which allow us to securely host and safeguard our website,\" the message said.\nThe digital records reviewed by Reuters showed the EGodly website, dataleak.fun, was tied to internet protocol addresses registered to DiamondCDN and other Coristine-owned entities between October 2022 and June 2023, and that some users attempting to access the site around that time would hit a DiamondCDN \"Security check.\"\nCoristine did not return messages seeking comment. Musk's team, which has adopted the name \"Department of Government Efficiency\" though it is not an official government department, did not respond to emails about Coristine. He is listed as a \"senior adviser\" at the State Department and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to one official at each agency who told Reuters they had seen his name in their respective agencies' staff directory.\nOn LinkedIn, Coristine describes himself as a \"Volunteer (Intern) Plumber\" with the U.S. government.\nThe State Department did not return messages asking about Coristine. CISA, which is responsible for protecting federal government networks from cybercriminals and foreign spies, declined comment.\nEGodly's Telegram channel has been inactive for the past year; attempts to elicit comment from eight people who participated in or interacted with EGodly were unsuccessful.\n'THESE ARE BAD FOLKS'\nDiamondCDN's website - CDN typically stands for \"content delivery network\" - was registered in mid-2022, according to records collected by DomainTools. It pitched itself as offering \"excellent security tools\" that would help \"lower your infrastructure costs,\" according to copies of the site maintained by the Internet Archive. The site said the company \"has no business inspecting user content.\"\nIn 2023, EGodly boasted on its Telegram channel of hijacking phone numbers, breaking into unspecified law enforcement email accounts in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and cryptocurrency theft. Early that year, the group distributed the personal details of an FBI agent who they said was investigating them, circulating his phone number, photographs of his house, and other private details on Telegram.\nEGodly also posted an audio recording of an obscene prank call made to the agent's phone and a video, shot from the inside of a car, of an unknown party driving by the agent's house in Wilmington, Delaware at night and screaming out the window, \"EGodly says you're a bitch!\"\nReuters could not independently verify EGodly's boasts of cybercriminal activity, including its claims to have hijacked phone numbers or infiltrated law enforcement emails. But it was able to authenticate the video by visiting the same Wilmington address and comparing the building to the one in the footage.\nThe FBI agent targeted by EGodly, who is now retired, told Reuters that the group had drawn law enforcement attention because of its connection to swatting, the dangerous practice of making hoax emergency calls to send armed officers swarming targeted addresses. The agent didn't go into detail. Reuters is not identifying him out of concern for further harassment.\n\"These are bad folks,\" the former agent said. \"They're not a pleasant group.\"\nHe declined to comment further about the harassment or whether EGodly had been or still was the subject of an FBI investigation. The FBI didn't return messages seeking comment on EGodly.\nReuters was not able to ascertain how long EGodly used DiamondCDN, or whether EGodly paid Coristine's company. Archived copies of DiamondCDN's website said the firm envisioned having both paying and nonpaying customers.\nAnother individual who has been subject to abuse from EGodly and a cybercrime researcher who has followed the group said it was composed of hardened fraudsters, citing the group's makeup and the credibility of its claims. Both asked not to be identified, citing fears of retaliation.\nEven if the connection between Coristine and EGodly were fleeting, Nitin Natarajan, who served as the deputy director of CISA under former President Joe Biden, told Reuters it was worrying that someone who provided services to EGodly only two years ago was part of a group that has gained wide access to government networks.\n\"This stuff was not in the distant past,\" he said. \"The recency of the activity and the types of groups he was associated would definitely be concerning.\"\n(Reporting by Raphael Satter in Wilmington, Delaware; additional reporting by AJ Vicens in Detroit; editing by Chris Sanders)"

      "text": "Republicans push to repeal D.C.'s governing power, but city supporters push for statehood\nWASHINGTON \u2012 For more than 50 years, the District of Columbia has had limited power to govern itself.\nIts residents don\u2019t have a voting member in Congress and have long lobbied for statehood to gain that representation.\nNow, some members of the Republican-led Congress are trying again to take away the district's \"home rule\" status.\nLegislation introduced last week by Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee would repeal the District of Columbia Home Rule Act.\nThe bill entitled, \u2018\u2019The Bringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident (BOWSER) Act,\u2019\u2019 would take effect a year after passage. It is named after D.C.\u2019s Mayor Muriel Bowser.\nBowser, who is serving her third term, said she had no comment on the bill's name, but has continued to press the case for D.C. statehood.\n\u201cThe District's focus is on how we become the 51st state. I know there's talk about other places being the 51st state, but we're going to be the 51st state,\u2019\u2019 Bowser told reporters at a youth development event Monday. \u201cAnd what that means is that we'll be treated just like every other American. So right now, we're not.\u2019\u2019\nLee and Ogles said the repeal is needed because of what they called the city\u2019s failures, including high crime rates, such as car jackings and assaults against members of Congress and staffers. They also point to federal bribery charges against Trayon White, one of the city councilmembers, as evidence of government corruption. The council expelled White earlier this month.\n\u201cThe corruption, crime, and incompetence of the D.C. government has been an embarrassment to our nation\u2019s capital for decades,\u201d Lee said in a statement. \u201cIt is long past time that Congress restored the honor and integrity of George Washington to the beautiful city which bears his name.\u201d\n'Pathway to becoming the 51st state'\nCritics are pushing back against the GOP bill.\nEleanor Holmes Norton, a nonvoting delegate who represents the city in Congress, called the GOP measure \u201canti-democratic rhetoric.\u201d\n\u201cWe have made significant progress in our historic march toward making D.C. the 51st state, and this is evidence of that progress,\u2019\u2019 she said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThis response from two Republicans from far away states is, predictably, to try to take away what small measure of democracy the more than 700,000 D.C. residents, a majority of whom are Black and Brown, have.\u201d\nHolmes Norton has repeatedly introduced bills to make Washington, D.C. a state. The House passed her measure in 2020 and 2021, but it stalled in the Senate.\nWashington is governed by a council and a mayor, but Congress has oversight. Under the Home Rule Act passed in 1973, Congress can review bills passed by the council before they become law, according to the D.C. government. Congress also has control over the city\u2019s budget.\nWith nearly 700,000 people, Bowser said D.C. is more populous than two states and its residents pay higher taxes than many others, but it doesn\u2019t have voting representation in Congress.\nHome rule is limited, said Bowser, \u201cbut what we should be focused on is our pathway to becoming the 51st state.\"\nResidents and civil rights groups have long lobbied for the nation\u2019s capital to become a state. Some critics have argued that effort has been resisted in part because the city has a significant Black population.\nFor years, a majority of the city\u2019s population was Black. In 2023, nearly 47% of the population was white and nearly 45% was Black, according to the U.S. Census.\nGreg Carr, an associate professor of Africana Studies at Howard University, called the Republican bill part of an effort to \u201clord over the District of Columbia and control the mayor.\"\nBowser and Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have bumped heads in the past. During Trump\u2019s first presidency, Bowser had the words \"Black Lives Matter\" painted in yellow on the pavement a block from the White House.\nTrump is back in office and Republicans now control both chambers in Congress.\n\u201cThis is theater, but it\u2019s theater that could stand a chance of passing,\" Carr said.\nBowser has to worry about how to protect D.C. residents, particularly the most vulnerable, and \"figure out how to navigate this storm in a way that will keep those people out of harm's way,\" Carr said.\nHolmes Norton said she will continue to push back against the current GOP bill and any other like it.\n\u201cI will defeat these efforts, which will only strengthen our case for statehood,\u201d she said."

      "text": "Early DOGE staffer assaulted in DC during attempted carjacking\nAn early staffer for the Department of Government Efficiency was assaulted in Washington, D.C., on Sunday night during an attempted carjacking.\nA police report obtained by USA TODAY says officers observed a group of about 10 kids surrounding Edward Coristine's car and assaulting him around 3 a.m. Sunday. The report said officers immediately got out of the car when they saw the incident, and the kids ran away.\nCoristine, who worked for one of Elon Musk's companies before he joined DOGE, became an infamous government staffer because of a colorful nickname he once used online. Musk left the government in May, and many of his staffers joined other areas of the government.\nCoristine told police that he saw the suspects approach the vehicle and make a comment about taking it, according to the police report. He was with his significant other, whom he pushed into the car for her safety before turning to deal with the suspects, who started assaulting him, the police report said.\nPresident Donald Trump posted a photo on social media Tuesday afternoon of a bloodied, shirtless man, whom other news outlets have identified as Coristine, along with criticism of crime committed by kids in Washington, D.C.\n\"Crime in Washington, D.C., is totally out of control,\" Trump wrote. \"Local 'youths' and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent Citizens.\"\nThe police report does not indicate that Coristine was shot.\n\"If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City,\" Trump wrote.\nLocal prosecutions are handled primarily by the U.S. Attorney's office for Washington, D.C. The Senate confirmed Trump nominee Jeanine Pirro to that role earlier this week.\nThe Metropolitan Police Department announced Tuesday it arrested two 15-year-olds from Maryland. They were charged with unarmed carjacking."

      "text": "DC statehood bill passes House for second time, legislation moves to split Senate\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Democratic-led House of Representatives again passed legislation Thursday that would make Washington, D.C., the 51st state \u2013 something residents and leaders in the nation's capital have been requesting for decades.\nThe bill passed 216-208.\nBut the Washington, D.C. Admission Act faces slim chances of advancing in the split Senate, where it would need Republican support to overcome a legislative hurdle known as the filibuster. Without at least 10 Senate Republican votes joining all 50 Democrats and independents, the legislation will not make it to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk\nThe bill, introduced by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., passed the House in the last Congress, though it was not given a vote in the then-Republican-majority Senate. The 2020 passage in the House marked the first time a D.C. statehood bill passed in either chamber of Congress.\nMore: What would statehood for Washington, DC mean \u2014 and could it finally happen?\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaking at a news conference Wednesday and donning a mask with the number \u201c51\u201d on it, said: \"Our founders built our democracy on a simple promise that every American should have a voice in our government: from City Hall, to the halls of Congress. Washingtonians. ... pay taxes, fight in our wars, contribute to the economic life of our country. But for centuries, they have been denied their right to representation.\"\n\"Taxation without representation\" is on Washington license plates because residents pay taxes but are not represented with a vote in Congress, Pelosi noted.\nResidents can vote in presidential elections. Norton is Washington's sole congressional delegate, a position that allows her to draft legislation but not vote, according to the city's government.\nWith HR 51, Pelosi continued, \"Congress is taking a significant step to enfranchise the people of D.C. with power to participate fully in our democracy.\"\nDemocrats, supporters of the legislation and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser have argued that statehood for Washington, a city with a large Black population, is a civil-rights issue. Supporters say statehood is necessary because the residents are disenfranchised with the lack of representation in Congress.\nCensus Bureau data shows that 46% of the district's population is African American, 11% is Hispanic or Latino and 4% is Asian.\nBut Republicans argue the population size of Washington makes it too small to be a state.\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., recently claimed that Washington \u201cwouldn\u2019t even qualify as a singular congressional district,\u201d and that should disqualify it from gaining statehood. She said so while Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican who represents Wyoming, stood behind her.\nWashington, D.C., with a population of around 700,000, is bigger than Wyoming and Vermont in terms of population, according to the most recent census data.\nRepublicans have also accused Democrats of seeking statehood for political gain, as residents in the district tend to lean toward that party politically. Since 2000, according to the Brookings Institute, the Democratic presidential nominee has captured over 89% of the vote in Washington.\nUnder the bill, the state would be represented by two senators, like all other states, and one member of the House of Representatives. The number of representatives a state has is based on population. Vermont, Delaware, Wyoming, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana each have one representative.\nRepublicans have long insisted those senators would be Democrats.\n\"They plan to make the District of Columbia a state \u2013 that\u2019d give them two new Democratic senators \u2013 Puerto Rico a state, that would give them two more new Democratic senators,\" McConnell said in an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham last year. \"So this is full bore socialism on the march in the House.\"\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaking from the Senate floor Thursday, said arguments against Washington statehood are rooted in bigotry.\n\u201cThe debate over D.C. statehood has taken a rather dark turn,\" he said. \"Some of my colleagues on the other side, rather than fashion any argument on the merits, have taken to denigrating the base worth of residents of the District of Columbia.\u201d\nAhead of the vote Thursday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called Washington statehood a \"scheme\" hinged on \"consolidating power and enacting radical policies.\"\nMore: Could DC, Puerto Rico become the next US states? Here's what Congress is considering\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, opposes the legislation, telling reporters he supports making Washington, D.C., a part of the state of Maryland, giving residents a voting member of the House, but not adding any members to the Senate.\nOn Tuesday, the White House formally backed the statehood for the district, saying the legislation would provide the Washington residents with \"long overdue full representation in Congress.\"\n\"Establishing the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth as the 51st state will make our Union stronger and more just,\" the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement. \"Washington, D.C. has a robust economy, a rich culture, and a diverse population of Americans from all walks of life who are entitled to full and equal participation in our democracy.\"\nRepublicans also say the Constitution specifically set aside land for the capital that was not a state.\nThe proposed state's territory would include all of the district's current territory, except for monuments and federal buildings such as the White House and Capitol building.\nThe issue of statehood resurfaced after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol building by supporters of former President Donald Trump. Bowser called on Congress to grant statehood to Washington. The mayor cannot deploy Washington's National Guard troops because authority over the Guard forces lies with the president, the secretary of defense and the secretary of the Army.\n\"Arguing that Washingtonians must remain disenfranchised to protect the interests of the federal government is dangerous, outdated and downright insulting,\" Bowser said during a March hearing in Congress.\nWith lawmakers such as Romney not on board, the legislation faces a grim future.\nWhile the Senate version of the legislation has more than 40 sponsors, several moderates remain undecided. A few Democrats, and all Republicans, have not co-sponsored it.\nBut House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., expressed optimism Wednesday about the future of the legislation, noting the bill has the support of Biden and Schumer.\n\"So, we're not in the same position we were last year,\" Hoyer said. \"We knew that Sen. McConnell was not going to put the bill on the floor for the wrong reasons. We're very hopeful that we can move forward on this. Obviously, we're going to need some Republicans to vote principle rather than politics.\""

William Brangham: At least four people were killed and 14 others were wounded in a drive-by shooting in Chicago overnight. Witnesses described the scene as a war zone. Police say the attacker fled and no one is in custody.Despite this horrific shooting, the city of Chicago saw a historic drop in homicides in the first half of the year. That's a trend that's largely been mirrored nationwide.So, for a deeper look at the state of violent crime in the U.S., I spoke earlier today with Jeff Asher. His Real-Time Crime Index compiles data from hundreds of law enforcement agencies nationwide.Jeff Asher, great to have you back on the program.Let's talk about this event in Chicago overnight, a horrible drive-by shooting. People see headlines like that, and they certainly are led to believe that we are in this violent crime spiral. Help us put these kinds of events into context. Jeff Asher, Co-Founder, AH Datalytics: Well, it's very difficult.First off, you don't ever want to downplay the tragedy, downplay the horror. Even when you're talking about dramatic declines in gun violence, dramatic declines in murder, you're still talking about too many of these incidents, too many of these tragedies.That said, it's difficult for people, I think, to put these things in context, because very rarely or never do you see a story there were no shootings yesterday, there were no murders yesterday. It's only in the presence of these tragedies that these things come to media attention.So, the fact of the matter is, Chicago has seen, I think, a 40 percent decline in shooting victims this year compared to the same time frame last year. It's seen a 30-something percent decline in murder. Nationwide, in cities of all sizes, we're seeing double-digit, 20-something percent declines in murders. So we are seeing these declines occurring pretty much everywhere, including in Chicago.But you also have something like this that comes to the public attention that very rightly so gets a lot of press and a lot of attention. It's just very challenging, I think, to balance that with the overall big-picture trend, which is certainly far more rosy. William Brangham: Do you have any sense as to why those numbers are coming down so dramatically? Jeff Asher: It's literally a billion-dollar question in terms of if you knew the amount of resources and effort that you would put into it would be tremendous.There's a real challenge to answering the question why. We know that there aren't more police officers in the vast majority of cities nationwide compared to where we were even two or three years ago, much less five or six years ago. We know that the root causes of violence really haven't been fixed. Poverty is still around. Education in a lot of cities still struggle.We know that the country is still awash in guns, still awash in firearms. There haven't been any tremendous changes there. We know that murder clearance rates especially have kind of bounced around, but they're still low by historical standards, even despite the drop in murder that we have seen over the last two years.So, putting all of that together, I think the most satisfying explanations are the big national explanations. The one that pops to my mind the most is that, after COVID, we had all of this spending on social programs, a 90 percent increase in construction from local and state governments on social and neighborhood centers, a 50 percent increase in public safety spending construction, 20 percent increase in highway spending from state and local governments.You had all of this spending, all of this hiring, all of these things that maybe weren't specifically tied to violence reduction, but that have had this kind of ancillary benefit of helping to interrupt these cycles of violence that started in 2020 and 2021 and bring violence to what could be some of the lowest levels that have ever been recorded in the country. William Brangham: One of the things you mentioned as possible factors in this decline might be reversed soon. The Trump administration has eliminated a lot of grants to community-based violence prevention efforts.Do you have any concern that that might have a negative effect on these positive trends you're seeing? Jeff Asher: I think the greater concern for me, rather than changing these programs is going to lead to an increase, is that, at some point, whether it's six months from now, three years from now, 10 years from now, we're going to see crimes start to increase.These trends, these historic declines are not going to continue forever. When that change happens, these are programs that are useful for arresting that change, for interrupting cycles of violence. And if we have divested from these programs, then we're in a much worse position when these trends inevitably change for whatever reason to respond to that change. William Brangham: All right, that is Jeff Asher, who is the co-founder of AH Datalytics.Always great to talk to you. Thank you very, very much. Jeff Asher: Thanks for having me.

That happened just a week after Pulliam filed an equal employment opportunity complaint against an assistant chief and the police union accused the department of deliberately falsifying crime data, according to three law enforcement sources familiar with the complaint.\nStream NBC4 newscasts for free right here, right now.\nThe union claims police supervisors in the department manipulate crime data to make it appear violent crime has fallen considerably compared to last year.\nPulliam \u2014 the former commander of the 3rd District that patrols Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights \u2014 was placed on leave with pay and told he was under investigation for questionable changes to crime data, five law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told News4.\nWe have the news you need to know to start your day. Sign up for the First & 4Most morning newsletter \u2014 delivered to your inbox daily.\nThat came about a week after he filed a complaint against Executive Assistant Chief of Police Andre Wright, according to three law enforcement sources familiar with the complaint.\nNews4 reached out to Pulliam for comment. He denied the allegations against him and referred us to the public information officer.\nUnion officials said there is a larger trend of manipulating crime statistics.\nLocal\nWashington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia local news, events and information\n\u201cWhen our members respond to the scene of a felony offense where there is a victim reporting that a felony occurred, inevitably there will be a lieutenant or a captain that will show up on that scene and direct those members to take a report for a lesser offense,\u201d Fraternal Order of Police Chairman Gregg Pemberton said. \u201cSo, instead of taking a report for a shooting or a stabbing or a carjacking, they will order that officer to take a report for a theft or an injured person to the hospital or a felony assault, which is not the same type of classification.\u201d\nThe police department's command staff is focusing on two categories in order to get the numbers to fall, Pemberton said: armed with a dangerous weapon and injured person to the hospital.\n\u201cWhen management officials are directing officers to take reports for felony assault, or if they're going back into police databases and changing offenses to felony assault, felony assault is not a category of crime that's listed on the department's daily crime stats,\u201d Pemberton said. \u201cIt's also not something that's a requirement of the FBI's uniform crime reporting program. So, by changing criminal offenses from, for example, ADW bat or ADW gun to felony assault, that would avoid both the MPD and the FBI from reporting that as a part one or a felony offense.\u201d\nThe union has been gathering evidence for some time now by looking at reports and talking with officers all over the city, Pemberton said.\n\u201cWhat we've heard through our members and through members of management that were willing to talk with the union is that this is a directive from the command staff, is that they wanna make sure that these classifications of these reports are adjusted over time to make sure that the overall crime stats stay down,\u201d Pemberton said. \u201cAnd this is deliberately done.\u201d\nAs of last Monday when News4 spoke with Pemberton, D.C. crime data shows violent crime was down 28%. Thursday, the department\u2019s website said violent crime is down 25% when compared to the same time last year, and overall crime is down 8%.\n\u201cThat's preposterous,\u201d Pemberton said. \u201cThere's absolutely no way crime could be down 28%. Last year they suggested that it went down 34%.\u201d\nIn April, Pulliam\u2019s wife, Capt. Rachel Pulliam, was transferred by Chief Pamela Smith from the Youth Division to midnights in the 7th District.\nSubsequently, according to three sources familiar with the incident and the timing of everything, Wright ordered Cmdr. Pulliam to pack up his wife\u2019s belongings from Youth Division and move them on his own to his wife\u2019s new assignment in 7D.\nHe viewed the order as retaliatory and a misuse of authority, sources familiar with the complaint said.\nAbout a week later, Cmdr. Pulliam\u2019s police powers were revoked, five law enforcement sources told News4.\nChief Smith told News4 she can\u2019t comment on an ongoing investigation.\nAs for the claims made by the union, Smith released this statement: \u201cThe Metropolitan Police Department is committed to upholding the trust and the confidence of the public. Any irregularity in crime data brought to my attention will be addressed immediately. I do not condone any official reclassifying criminal offenses outside the guidelines set in MPD policy. Any allegation of this behavior will be dealt with through our internal processes, which will ensure those members are held accountable. I have the utmost confidence in the command staff leadership currently in place across the Metropolitan Police Department.\u201d\nWright declined to comment to News4.\nSign up for our free deep-dive newsletter, The 4Front, to get standout News4 stories sent right to your inbox.

      "text": "Mayor Brandon M. Scott Statement on Continued Decrease in Gun Violence Across Baltimore\nFriday Aug 1st, 2025\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nBALTIMORE, MD (Friday, August 1, 2025) - Today, Mayor Brandon M. Scott released the following statement as Baltimore continues to experience historic reductions in violent crime through July of 2025. Compared to this time last year, the city has seen a 24.3% decrease in homicides and a 18.3% decline in nonfatal shootings. So far this year, Baltimore has had 84 homicides- the fewest in over 50 years- compared to 111 homicides in the first seven months of 2024.\n\"The decreases we are seeing as a city are not a coincidence. They are the result of so many partners working together to advance our shared vision for a better, safer Baltimore- both today and for the generations to come,\" said Mayor Brandon M. Scott. \"From the brave men and women of BPD, to our team at MONSE, to our partners in the Governor's Office, the State Attorney's Office, U.S. Attorney's Office, and the Office of the Attorney General, to organizations working on the ground to prevent violence in our communities, and- most importantly- to residents standing up to violence in their neighborhoods, Baltimore is saying enough is enough. While we continue to see meaningful progress, we know that as long as we continue to lose neighbors to violence, we have to double down, and deepen the work that is driving these historic reductions.\"\nSince Mayor Scott took office, the Baltimore Police Department's (BPD) homicide clearance rate has jumped from 40.3% in 2020 to 68.2% in 2024. The clearance rate for 2025 is currently 64.3%, significantly above the national average.\nThe City's Group Violence Reduction Strategy (GVRS), a key partnership between BPD, the Mayor's Office, and prosecutors, which focuses on violent groups responsible for driving the majority of violence in Baltimore, has seen success by balancing services and accountability. Together, they work to get those at the very highest risk of being involved in violence to put down the guns and change their behaviors. The strategy has led to over 414 arrests and connected over 261 individuals to life coaching and wraparound services through YAP, Inc., and Roca. Approximately 95.8% of participants have not been revictimized and 97.7% have not recidivated after enrolling in services as part of the strategy. GVRS recently expanded to Baltimore's Southern Police District in June 2025.\nCrime continues to be down across most major categories. As of July 26, 2025, compared to last year, auto thefts are down 34%, robberies are down 23%, arson is down 10%, and carjackings are down 15%."

      "text": "Why doesn't Washington have a governor like states do?\nWashington, D.C. is a district not a state. It does have a mayor, but is still largely controlled by the federal government.\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to send National Guard troops to Washington and put the Metro Washington Police Department under direct federal control comes in part because of the city's unique status as a district, rather than a state.\nTrump made the announcement in a August 11 press conference, saying the move is intended to bring down crime in the city. According to crime statistics from the Metropolitan Police Department released August 11, show that violent crime in the city is down 26% from 2024.\nWhy doesn't Washington have a governor like states do?\nWashington is a district, not a state, so it doesn't have a governor. For most of it's history it didn't have control over its own budget or affairs. Instead, U.S. Congress and the president both play some of the roles managing the district that a governor would.\nIn 1973, Congress gave locals some authority with the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allowed citizens to elect a Mayor and Council.\nBut, Congress still reviews all legislation passed by the Council before it can become law and has authority over the District\u2019s budget. The president appoints District judges, and citizens have a delegate in the House who cannot vote rather than a representative.\nTrump cited Section 740 of the Home Rule Act in taking control of the police department.\nWho is Mayor Muriel Bowser?\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser is the district's seventh elected mayor. She was elected in 2015 after serving as an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner from 2004 to 2006 and as a Member of the D.C. Council from 2007 to 2015.\nBowser and Trump clashed during his first term, but so far have had a cordial relationship in his second term.\nOn Aug. 8 she pushed back on Trump's claims that rising crime warranted the federal government taking over law enforcement in the city, but acknowledged that he can.\n\"We are not experiencing a crime spike,\" she said on MSNBC's \"The Weekend.\" \"The President is very aware of our efforts. He established a task force, which our police department and agencies support with information and anything else they ask us for. ... It is always the President's prerogative to use federal law enforcement or the National Guard.\""

      "text": "Trump, GOP vow to fix DC. Residents would prefer to run their city themselves.\nTrump wants the city cleaned up. Congress is holding $1 billion in DC taxes in limbo. Residents just want a say.\n- President Trump has criticized D.C.'s leadership and called for cleaning up the city.\n- Congressional oversight of D.C.'s budget and laws has long been a point of contention.\n- D.C. residents and officials are pushing for statehood amid these challenges to their autonomy.\nWASHINGTON \u2012 Three generations of Jenice L. View\u2019s family have called this city home. One of her grandmothers arrived here from South Carolina decades ago. Her father left here to serve in the Korean War. And it\u2019s in this city where the District of Columbia native and her husband raised their two daughters.\nFor View, it\u2019s disheartening to see her city \u2013 the nation\u2019s capital \u2013 under attack, with congressional threats to strip $1 billion of its funding, take control of its local government and end its already limited authority to govern itself.\n\u201cFor people who care about democracy in this country \u2026 just know there are a whole bunch of us,\" she said, who have not had access to \"full democracy.\"\nAmerica's mostly Democratic capital city now sits in the crosshairs of Republicans leading the country.\nThe GOP-led Congress, which has budgetary control of the district, could decide as early as this week whether to restore $1 billion collected from local taxpayers that sits in limbo. At the same time, President Donald Trump said this city of nearly 700,000 needs to be spruced up and restored by reducing crime and moving homeless encampments away from monuments and federal buildings.\n\u201cWe need to clean up our once beautiful Capital City, and make it beautiful again,\" Trump wrote in a post last month. \u201cWe will be TOUGH ON CRIME, like never before. I will work with the Mayor on this and, if it does not happen, will have no choice but to do it myself.\"\nThe city bordered by Maryland and Virginia has long had a contentious relationship with Republicans, but some longtime residents said the attacks have been ratcheted up to a new level. The district, they said, has been a laboratory or \u201cpunching bag for Congress\u201d and presidents.\n\"This is a pattern. This is not new. It is always frustrating,\" said View, a retired professor of education specializing in history. \u201cThis is, to me, the most frightening of the attacks because there seems to be so much more energy and power and hateful targeting.\u201d\nAttacks are 'low-hanging fruit'\nRepublican attacks on Washington aren\u2019t surprising, particularly since Trump has made clear his disdain for the city and its leaders, said Greg Carr, an associate professor of Africana Studies at Howard University in Washington.\n\u201cThis is the low-hanging fruit,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThis is his obsession.\u2019\u2019\nTrump had repeatedly criticized Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s handling of city business and has threatened a takeover of what he has called a \u201crat-infested, graffiti-infested\u201d city.\nLast month, Trump signed an executive order titled \"Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful\" that sets up a task force of federal officials to clean up the city. The order, among other things, directs federal authorities to beef up police presence, get rid of homeless encampments and clean up graffiti on federal lands.\n\u201cAs the capital city of the greatest Nation in the history of the world, it should showcase beautiful, clean, and safe public spaces,\" it read.\nA spending package passed by the House last month to prevent a government shutdown, would force D.C. officials to cut $1 billion from the city's $21 billion annual budget.\nViolent crime is down 26% from last year, Bowser said, but a budget cut would imperil public safety programs.\n\u201cWe need to have our budget issue resolved at the Congress, and we need it done as soon as possible,\u201d Bowser, a Democrat, said at a news conference last week.\nTrump also has called for the House to provide the money.\nHome rule challenged\nSeparately, city workers last month began ripping up a Black Lives Matter mural blocks from the White House.\nBowser had ordered the mural during the protests after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. A Republican lawmaker had threatened to take away millions of dollars in transportation funding if the city didn\u2019t remove it.\nEarlier this year, Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee introduced The Bringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident (BOWSER) Act, which would repeal the District of Columbia Home Rule Act.\nWashington is governed by a council and a mayor, but Congress has oversight. Under the Home Rule Act passed in 1973, Congress can review bills passed by the council before they become law. Congress also has control over the city\u2019s budget.\nHome rule gave D.C. officials some sense of control of their budget, said Courtland Cox, a civil rights veteran who has lived in the district since 1960.\n\u201cIt was really a big fight,\" he recalled. \"We still haven't gotten all we need to, but it's always been a struggle to make sure that we were able to have some form of self-governance.\u201c\nCarr said congressional lawmakers have \"always had the district in a chokehold.\u201d\nEleanor Holmes Norton, a nonvoting delegate who represents the district in Congress, said more than 20 anti-home-rule measures have been introduced in this session of Congress.\n\u201cD.C.\u2019s authority to govern itself is under attack, objectively speaking,\u2019\u2019 Norton said in an email. \u201cD.C. home rule is seeing more attacks now from the federal government than any time since the 1990s.\u2019\u2019\nDemocracy is under threat not only in D.C. but also across the country, said Matthew Frumin, a Democratic city council member.\n\u201cThese are terrifying times,\u2019\u2019 said Frumin, who spoke Wednesday at a discussion about democracy in D.C. hosted by the University of the District of Columbia.\nRenewed push for statehood\nThe uncertainty has motivated activists and officials to press Congress yet again to make D.C. a state \u2012 even though they know the chances this session are slim.\n\u201cI want to believe that there are people in this country who are offended by the idea that the nation's capital does not have a vote in Congress, does not have control over its own budget, and would perceive that as egregious,\" View said.\nSupporters of statehood noted that the city has more people than some states. Wyoming, for example, has a population of 576,000.\nRepublicans have long opposed statehood for the district, which votes overwhelmingly Democratic. Some experts have argued the city's significant Black population, who historically vote Democratic, has also been a factor.\nThe district \u201cshould have the ability to govern itself to the same extent the states enjoy and should be equipped equally to fight back against proposed federal government actions that would harm its interests,\" said Norton, who has championed DC statehood.\nDana Reynolds, a D.C. resident, called it \u201cpetty\" that some congressional lawmakers are attacking the city when there are many pressing problems across the country.\nAnd though she said city officials should do more to address crime, Congress should support efforts to make the district the 51st state.\n\u201cWe pay taxes. We should have appropriate representation,\" Reynolds said. \u201cI cannot see the federal government and lawmakers who don\u2019t live in the city dictating what we need and don\u2019t need.\u201d\nFor View, that fight has been real for generations. She's frustrated by the continued attacks and Congress' failure to make the district a state.\n\u201cSome people say, \u2018Well, just move to Maryland,\u2019\" she said. \u201cI love Maryland. But no, that\u2019s not the solution. The solution is we need voting rights. We need control over our budgets. We need representation in Congress. We need to be left the hell alone.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "President Donald Trump announced a plan to federalize law enforcement in Washington, D.C., citing rising crime rates, despite local officials disputing his claims and noting a decrease in violent crime. The plan includes deploying the National Guard and placing local police under federal control, which critics argue is an abuse of executive power. Additionally, Republican lawmakers are pushing to repeal D.C.'s Home Rule Act, further limiting the district's self-governance, while advocates for D.C. statehood argue that the city's residents deserve full representation and autonomy.",
