  "content": "Can Direct Sunlight Damage Your Laptop? Here's What You Need To Know\n\nIf you are among those who hold a remote job, you might want to make your day exciting by experimenting with different workspaces. Working outdoors can be great way to keep the inspiration flowing, especially for creative professionals. A quiet green park can make the most mundane of tasks seem exciting, however, there is a catch. Both you and your laptop might struggle under direct sunlight after prolonged exposure. Most laptops are not designed to function under direct sunlight and may show some immediate warning signs. Frequent overheating with prolonged usage under direct sunlight can permanently degrade the battery's performance. Additionally, components such as LCD screens can wash out and make the visuals appear dull. Laptop parts may even warp under high heat, ruining the aesthetics of your machine. That said, you can still work outdoors if you are better prepared to handle the sunlight. While your sunscreen might not help, sunshades tailor-made to protect laptops from direct sun exposure can be a good option. Here's all the damage direct sunlight can cause and how to protect your laptop against it.\n\nSunlight can damage the internals of a laptop Most electronics, especially the battery-powered ones don't fare well under direct sunlight. That's because overheating can permanently damage components such as batteries and processors. Most laptops use Lithium-Ion batteries that are designed to be operated under a specific temperature range. Prolonged use under direct sunlight can degrade the battery's performance and you may need the charger more frequently. In extreme cases, the battery might swell and become more vulnerable to combustion. This is the reason why your iPhone will display a temperature warning message when you leave your it in the sun for too long. You may have also noticed the warm air coming from the fans on your laptop. These fans perform the essential task of keeping your laptop cool, as the processor and GPU can overheat on their own. Add direct sunlight to the mix, and the fans might not be able to dissipate the extra heat. In some cases, the laptop might lag due to thermal throttling or even shut down abruptly. Apart from the overheating, the UV radiation in sunlight can also be detrimental to LCD screens and the laptop body. The organic components inside an LCD display can be damaged under UV and IR radiation and may result in distorted or washed-out colors. Moreover, the non-UV resistant materials can also fade in color with prolonged UV exposure.\n\nYou should avoid using your laptop under direct sunlight to avoid possible damage, however, there are some workarounds to safely work outdoors during the day. The easiest is to find a shade from a tree or other structure to keep your laptop safe. However, if you can't find one or need a permanent solution, you could opt for a laptop sunshade. These sunshades enclose the laptop's body and stop direct sunlight from falling onto the device. Some heat resistant ones absorb the sun's heat to further keep the laptop cool. You also get the added benefit of better screen visibility as low-brightness displays can be hard to see in daylight. While these laptop accessories can improve productivity, sunshades can often look awkward and might make you conscious while in public. The ambient heat can still cause overheating despite using a sunshade and you should constantly monitor the CPU and GPU temperatures to ensure everything is cool under the hood. Additionally, a portable laptop stand for better airflow and an anti-glare screen protector can be good investments if you work outdoors frequently.",

      "text": "What Causes A Swollen Battery In Your Laptop & Is It Safe To Still Use?\nFrom smartphones to laptops to even styluses like the Apple Pencil, many devices rely on lithium-ion batteries. These batteries have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their slim design, enabling thinner and sleeker laptops that offer ultimate portability.\nWhile these batteries are undeniably the reason why our devices can run the entire day with a single charge, they're far from perfect and can be prone to swelling under certain conditions, such as overcharging, excessive heat, or age-related degradation. With lithium-ion batteries, the amount of charge they withhold diminishes as they chemically age. As these batteries age, the repeated charge and discharge cycles cause chemical reactions within the battery to become less efficient over time. This eventually leads to the buildup of gasses, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, alongside other hazardous gasses potentially, which in turn causes the battery to swell.\nSo, can you still use a laptop with a swollen battery? The short answer is no, a laptop with a swollen battery isn't typically safe to use and is a clear warning sign that your laptop needs to be repaired immediately. Let's take a closer look at what causes a swollen battery, if there's anything you can do to prevent it, and what it means for your device's performance and safety.\nWhat causes your laptop's battery to swell or expand?\nEver heard people say not to charge your devices overnight? There's a good reason for it: the most common cause of battery swelling is overcharging. When a laptop is left plugged in for extended periods, the battery continues to receive energy even after it's fully charged. This excess current causes the battery's chemicals to degrade over time. As a result, the lithium-ion batteries end up releasing all the toxic gasses that build up within the sealed battery casing, eventually leading to a swollen battery.\nOther than overcharging, a swollen battery can also occur due to impact. Regardless of how durable you think your $1,000 laptop is, it's just as susceptible to damage as any other device. An accidental knock or drop can end up puncturing the delicate layers within a lithium-ion battery, and expose the battery's internal components to hot air. This can potentially trigger chemical reactions that release toxic gasses like methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen, and lead to a swollen battery.\nExternal environments, like leaving your laptop in a parked car when the weather's exceptionally hot during the summers, can also cause your laptop's internal components to heat up. This could ultimately lead to your battery swelling up. Your laptop's battery swelling might not necessarily have anything to do with you. At times, your battery may also undergo pre-mature swelling due to faulty construction, poor-quality materials, or errors during the manufacturing process.\nIf your laptop's battery is swollen, is it still safe to use?\nAfter spending thousands on a laptop, everyone wants to maximize their device's life and dread the thought of having to spend hundreds (if not thousands) on repairs or replacements. Unfortunately, while laptops nowadays are more durable than ever, they're not immune to issues. While software issues can often be fixed with a quick Google search, hardware issues like swollen batteries are much more complex. There's little to no space for experimentation or taking risks when it comes to the health and safety of your device. If you've noticed your laptop changing shape, its screen not closing completely, a visible gap between the upper and lower parts of the case, or failing to sit perfectly flat, we have some bad news for you: there's a good chance your device's battery may be swelling.\nSwollen batteries not only ruin your device's physical appearance but also pose significant safety hazards, including the risk of leaks, overheating, or even fire. Many users on forums like Reddit have shared stories of laptops emitting fumes and eventually catching fire due to swollen batteries. For example, in one Reddit post, a laptop began releasing smoke and eventually burst into flames. The users immediately attempted to pick up the burning device and take it outside. While this was a risky move given the dangers involved, it goes to how just how dangerous a swollen battery can be. So, if your device shows any signs of battery swelling, it's a good idea to seek professional help immediately, instead of continuing to use your device or attempting a self-repair."

      "text": "What Happens If You Leave Your iPhone In The Sun Too Long\nSince sunlight was introduced as a renewable energy source, solar-powered consumer devices have been popping up in the market. There's the solar flashlight, solar speaker, and solar power bank, which all recharge with the sun's help. If you camp often, one of the most useful camping gadgets is a solar generator, which converts sunlight into usable electricity for your other devices.\nHowever, outside of these sun-dependent gadgets, most electronics aren't made to be exposed to sunlight for that long. Your iPhone is one of them. It can only tolerate up to a certain level of heat before showing signs of underperformance. Unfortunately, there will be times you might accidentally leave your iPhone in the sun too long. Maybe you're using it to play music in the car, but forgot to take it with you after you get to your destination. Or perhaps you're sunbathing at the beach and didn't remember to put the device away before swimming.\nSo, what exactly happens to your iPhone if it's left under the sun for too long?\nThe effects of leaving your iPhone in the sun too long\niPhones are designed to operate in environments with an ambient temperature range of 32\u00ba to 95\u00ba F (0\u00ba and 35\u00ba C) and be stored at -4\u00ba to 113\u00ba F (-20\u00ba and 45\u00ba C). Once your device detects that the surrounding heat level is over this safe range \u2014 for instance, when you leave your iPhone in the sun too long \u2014 it will try to adjust its internal temperature. This helps keep the handset from getting too hot and prevents damage to the internal components.\nAs a result of this thermal regulation process, your iPhone will no longer work as it normally does, at least temporarily. It might scale back some features like switching the cellular radio to a low-power state, slowing down app processes, and lowering the frame rates. Other functionalities, including charging, screen brightness, and camera, might be disabled altogether.\nWhen the temperature becomes too much for the iPhone to handle, you might see a temperature warning pop up on your screen. It shows a thermometer icon and the message \"iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it.\" This means you can't use your device in the meantime, unless it's for making emergency calls. What you need to do when your iPhone starts overheating is to keep it out of the sun right away. Then, power it down and leave it in a cooler location for a few minutes to several hours until it returns to its normal temperature."
