      "feedback": "The analysis draft provides a solid foundation but requires enhancements in several areas to achieve world-class quality. First, deepen the causal chain by explicitly linking Trump's disappointment with Putin to potential market reactions, clarifying how this sentiment could influence investor behavior. Ensure coherence by clearly stating the implications of a U.S.-Russia meeting on specific sectors, particularly energy and defense, and quantify potential market movements (e.g., percentage changes in stock prices or indices) based on historical precedents. Additionally, align the analysis with the 0–3 week horizon by emphasizing immediate catalysts, such as the ceasefire deadline, and specify key thresholds for market reactions (e.g., specific price levels for energy stocks). Avoid generic statements by providing concrete scenarios for both positive and negative outcomes, including specific triggers for invalidation of the base case. Lastly, increase citation density by referencing additional relevant sources to bolster claims and reconcile any conflicting viewpoints. Overall, aim for specificity and quantification to enhance clarity and depth.",
