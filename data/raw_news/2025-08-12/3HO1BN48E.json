  "content": "ESPN\u2019s Tony Gossi is telling his side of the awkward exchange with Shedeur Sanders after Friday night\u2019s Brown-Panthers preseason game.\n\nGossi was confronted by the Browns\u2019 rookie quarterback after the latter impressed during his debut with Cleveland.\n\n\u201cTony, I be hoping you have something positive to say about me,\u201d Sanders told Grossi in a video posted to Deion Sanders Jr.\u2019s YouTube account. \u201cYou only say negative stuff about me. And I\u2019m like, \u2018I ain\u2019t do nothing to you.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t hear nothing positive you\u2019ve ever said,\u201d Sanders said with a smile.\n\n\u201cWhat I do to you, Tony?\u201d Sanders said with a laugh as he walked away.\n\nOn Monday, the reporter addressed the situation on his self-titled \u201cThe Daily Grossi\u201d show on ESPN Cleveland, saying that he was surprised by Sanders\u2019 comments, although the conversation was \u201cgood-natured.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing to note was that I initiated the conversation,\u201d Grossi said, via Awful Announcing. \u201cHe left the podium to walk to the locker room and I called his name to ask him another question. And that\u2019s when he discussed what was on his mind. I was a little surprised he went into that because as I said, it was inaudible but I said, \u2018Hey, this is your night man. This is a big night for you, have fun.\u2019 But I appreciated the fact that he did not say what was on his mind from the podium, which other quarterbacks have done with me, which is very uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nThe YouTube video of the back-and-forth being posted by Sanders\u2019 half-brother also took Rossi by surprise.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that this interaction was filmed without my knowledge,\u201d Grossi said. \u201cIt turns out, it was his brother, who is documenting everything from his rookie season. That\u2019s fine, just now that I\u2019m aware of it, I\u2019ll be a little more careful and everything. But everybody that saw the video, it was good-natured. I don\u2019t know what caused us to laugh, I really can\u2019t recall that conversation precisely. But we went on good terms.\n\n\u201cWe had a couple [of] other words in the locker room, too. But I was a little surprised that, on his big night, and it was a big night for him with all of the circumstances, that he would raise this. That\u2019s why I thought he was joking. It shouldn\u2019t have been that big of a deal on his mind after his big night. Anyways, all is good. We saw each other today at practice, and we move on.\u201d\n\nThe exchange came just minutes after Sanders\u2019 press conference following a 138 passing yard, two-touchdown performance in a 30-10 win over the Panthers.\n\nAfter the game, Grossi offered the first-year signal-caller the praise he asked for.\n\n\u201cI thought Shedeur was outstanding,\u201d he said during an appearance on ESPN Cleveland afterwards.\n\nHe later wrote: \u201cMy bottom line on Shedeur Sanders\u2019 impressive debut: He put the pressure on QB2 Kenny Pickett and QB3 Dillon Gabriel to get healthy and perform next week.\u201d",

      "text": "Before his son Shedeur Sanders\u2019 first NFL preseason game, Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders made one \u201cpromise\u201d about the quarterback\u2019s NFL future.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be a problem after tonight, I promise you that,\u201d the Colorado head football coach said.\nIf Friday\u2019s Browns-Panthers game was a preview, there might be some credence to that guarantee.\nThe younger Sanders made his debut for Cleveland, connecting for two touchdown passes in a 30-10 win on the road.\nSanders, playing most of the first three quarters, went 14-for-23 on his pass attempts for 138 yards. He rushed for 19 yards.\nThe 23-year-old finished with a 106.8 passer rating and did not throw an interception.\n\u201cI did some good and bad. I know moving forward I won\u2019t do the same mistakes twice, whatever the decision is,\u201d Sanders told reporters after the game.\nAfter the Browns recovered a muffed punt late in the first quarter, Sanders \u2014 taking over for his fourth drive \u2014 was set up for his first red zone chance.\nHe did not miss.\nOn second down from the 7-yard line, Sanders faked a handoff and rolled to his left and waited a beat before floating a perfect ball toward the back of the end zone between two Panthers defensive backs and into the hands of Kaden Davis for a touchdown.\nIt elicited an excited response from his proud dad.\n\u201cYes Lawd! Yes! @ShedeurSanders,\u201d Deion wrote on X.\nOn the Browns\u2019 final full series of the first half, Sanders led a 60-yard drive, finishing it off with a 12-yard strike to a diving Davis for his second score of the night.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t nervous, so I didn\u2019t really have too much adrenaline,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt was just getting comfortable, that\u2019s all it is. There were plenty of games before I was nervous, but I felt like I knew the answers to the test.\u201d\nHe helped lead one more touchdown drive in the third quarter, throwing two completions for 25 yards before Gage Larvadain scampered into the end zone on a four-yard run.\n\u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable being uncomfortable,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI got pockets of finding my rhythm, and I got to get into that quicker. \u2026 But overall, I felt like me out there.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m pleased with the way Shedeur played,\u201d head coach Kevin Stefanski said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with the way the offense operated tonight.\u201d\nSanders, who slipped to the Browns in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, started off slow, with the team calling some conservative plays early on a three-and-out first series and the QB completing his first pass (for four yards) short of the first-down sticks.\nHe showed off his versatility with a 10-yard scramble on the next series, which ended deep in Panthers territory after the Browns went for it on fourth-and-1 and failed when Sanders threw the ball away after nearly getting sacked.\nBut in leading three scoring drives, Sanders flashed the promise \u2014though he admitted there was some sloppiness, including taking two sacks \u2014 he had when he starred under his dad at Colorado.\n\u201cI know I\u2019m ready for the moment,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cDid I play up to par? No, I don\u2019t feel like I did. But the main goal was to win.\u201d"

      "text": "Shedeur Sanders turned heads in his preseason debut, and after the game he let one of his critics know about it.\nThe Browns\u2019 rookie quarterback, the son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was terrific Friday night as the starter.\nHe threw for 138 yards and two touchdowns in a 30-10 win over the Panthers.\nAfterwards, a YouTube video posted by half-brother Deion Sanders Jr., shows him confronting one of the team\u2019s beat writers, Tony Rossi of ESPN, in the bowels of Bank of America Stadium.\nSanders, the most famous fifth-round pick in recent memory, kept the chat mostly upbeat, but he did let his feelings be known.\n\u201cTony, I be hoping you have something positive to say about me,\u201d Sanders told Grossi in the video. \u201cYou only say negative stuff about me. And I\u2019m like, \u2018I ain\u2019t do nothing to you.\u2019\u201d\nGrossi\u2019s response was inaudible, but it looks like he was trying to offer his side.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t hear nothing positive you\u2019ve ever said,\u201d said Sanders, who then laughed and gave Grossi a friendly pat on the shoulder.\n\u201cWhat I do to you, Tony?\u201d Sanders said with a laugh as he walked away.\nGrossi did offer Sanders praise.\n\u201cI thought Shedeur was outstanding,\u201d he said during an appearance on ESPN Cleveland afterwards.\nHe later wrote: \u201cMy bottom line on Shedeur Sanders\u2019 impressive debut: He put the pressure on QB2 Kenny Pickett and QB3 Dillon Gabriel to get healthy and perform next week.\u201d\nGrossi has been critical of Sanders throughout the start of training camp.\nOn ESPN Cleveland this week, he questioned the circumstances around the 2024 Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year missing a practice due to a sore arm.\nThat led to a viral outburst from Tony Rizzo during his daily radio show, The Really Big Show.\nSanders, who infamously fell from a potential first-round pick to going in the fifth round, is looking to use this performance to vault up the Browns\u2019 depth chart."

      "text": "On the field, Shedeur Sanders couldn\u2019t have had a better preseason debut, looking poised and polished against the Carolina Panthers on Friday night. But after the game, Sanders once again found himself involved in controversy when a video was posted on social media of an interaction with ESPN Cleveland host Tony Grossi, who spoke about the interaction on Monday.\nAfter Friday\u2019s game, Sanders aired his grievances with Grossi, explaining how he believed that Grossi has only had negative things to say about him.\nUltimately, the situation didn\u2019t get overly heated from either party. But interestingly, it was far different from how Grossi, who actually initiated the conversation with Sanders, expected the situation to go.\nSpeaking about the incident on Monday\u2019s edition of The Daily Grossi show on ESPN Cleveland, Grossi explained how he initially called Sanders\u2019 name to ask him one more question after his postgame press conference, but was instead blindsided by Sanders\u2019 grievances about how he has been covered.\n\u201cOne thing to note was that I initiated the conversation,\u201d said Grossi. \u201cHe left the podium to walk to the locker room and I called his name to ask him another question. And that\u2019s when he discussed what was on his mind. I was a little surprised he went into that because as I said, it was inaudible but I said, \u2018Hey, this is your night man.

It was really nice to meet ya \ud83e\udd1d Never take for granted that many of my best friends are the ones I met in elementary school,\u201d Balionis, 39, captioned the Saturday post. \u201cTo take this trip with them\u2026 well I think 5th grade us would be really proud of how far we\u2019ve come, and that we continue to choose to do it together \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f also shoutout to the guys for marrying the most fun partners \ud83e\udee1.\u201d\nBalionis looked stunning in a white bikini as she enjoyed a coconut cocktail under the sun.\nOther images spotlighted group dinners, sightseeing and partying in fluorescent-lit clubs.\nBalionis took some well-deserved time off after 19 weeks on the road with \u201cGolf on CBS.\u201d\nLast week, she shared a tribute to her broadcast team, including photos from the season.\n\u201cHard to put into words what 19 weeks on the road really looks like,\u201d Balionis wrote. \u201cFor us announcers, we have it easy \u2014 we show up to work with hotel rooms already booked, everything we need waiting at check-in.
