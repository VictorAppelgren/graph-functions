  "description": "Vancouver, British Columbia, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NevGold Corp. (\u201cNevGold\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV:NAU) (OTCQB:NAUFF) (Frankfurt:5E50) is pleased to announce the commencement of the 2025 drill program at the oxide gold-antimony (\u201cAntimony\u201d, \u201cSb\u201d) Limousine Butte Project (the \u201cProject\u201d, \u201cLimo Butte\u201d) in Nevada. The Company continues to advance the substantial gold-antimony potential of the Project, highlighting its promising prospects for further exploration and development in Nevad",
  "content": "NevGold CEO, Brandon Bonifacio, comments: \u201cWe are excited to commence our 2025 drill program at Limo Butte with the objective of advancing the Project to an initial oxide gold-antimony Mineral Resource Estimate (\u201cMRE\u201d) . Over recent years our technical team has gained a strong understanding of the regional and project geology. We have a well defined program with the goal of significantly expanding the mineralization footprints at our two most advanced target areas, Resurrection Ridge and Cadillac Valley. Compared to most of the other gold-antimony or antimony projects in the United States, we have the ability to rapidly advance project development with our strong institutional knowledge of the Project. We have completed significant upfront work on the large geological database and permitting. Our focus remains on unlocking the gold-antimony potential at Limo Butte as there is a strong macroeconomic environment and clear commitment from the United States to advance high-quality, domestic, mineral projects.\u201d\n\nFirst Drill Program Under Advanced Plan of Operations (\u201cPoO\u201d) Permit: this is the first drill program at the Project under the approved PoO permit. ( see NevGold News Release from November 27, 2024 ) The expanded area of the PoO now covers other untested targets on the property, providing significant mineralization expansion potential.\n\nNew Stibiconite (Antimony Oxide Mineral) Outcrops: as part of the road and drill pad construction, additional stibiconite outcrops were exposed. The eastern side of Resurrection Ridge has strong geological potential with mineralization open to the East. (Figure 2, Figure 3)\n\nPath to Initial Oxide Gold-Antimony Mineral Resource Estimate (\u201cMRE\u201d): the objective of the drill program is to advance Limo Butte to an initial oxide gold-antimony MRE. Due to the large historical drillhole database, the 2025 program will include both delineation and expansion drillholes focused on both gold and antimony. This is the first drill program at the Project that has been focused on both gold and antimony.\n\nDrilling Commenced in August: the company started a 5,000 meter Reverse Circulation (\u201cRC\u201d) drill program focused on the Resurrection Ridge and Cadillac Valley Target Areas. The initial phase of the program will start at Resurrection Ridge. (Figure 1, Figure 4, Figure 5)\n\nVancouver, British Columbia, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NevGold Corp. (\u201c NevGold \u201d or the \u201c Company \u201d) ( TSXV:NAU) (OTCQB:NAUFF) (Frankfurt:5E50 ) is pleased to announce the commencement of the 2025 drill program at the oxide gold-antimony (\u201cAntimony\u201d, \u201cSb\u201d) Limousine Butte Project (the \u201cProject\u201d, \u201cLimo Butte\u201d) in Nevada. The Company continues to advance the substantial gold-antimony potential of the Project, highlighting its promising prospects for further exploration and development in Nevada, one of the world\u2019s prolific mining jurisdictions.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 RC drill rig drilling the Resurrection Ridge Target Area looking northeast.

A 30g gold fire assay and multi-elemental analysis ICP-OES method was completed by ISO 17025 certified American Assay Labs, Reno.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Qualified Person (\u201cQP\u201d), Greg French, Vice President, Exploration has completed a review of the historical data in this press release. The historic data collection chain of custody procedures and analytical results by previous operators appear adequate and were completed to industry standard practices. For the Newmont and US Gold data a 30g gold fire assay and multi-elemental analysis ICP-OES method MS-41 was completed by ISO 17025 certified ALS Chemex, Reno or Elko Nevada.\n\nTechnical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Greg French, CPG, the Company\u2019s Vice President, Exploration, who is NevGold\u2019s Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101 and responsible for technical matters of this release.\n\n\n\nNevGold is an exploration and development company targeting large-scale mineral systems in the proven districts of Nevada and Idaho. NevGold owns a 100% interest in the Limousine Butte and Cedar Wash gold projects in Nevada, and the Nutmeg Mountain gold project and Zeus copper project in Idaho.\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the Company\u2019s current expectations and estimates.
