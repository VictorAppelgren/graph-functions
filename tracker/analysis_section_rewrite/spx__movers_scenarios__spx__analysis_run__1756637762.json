      "feedback": "Add the canonical handle “spx” to every line and embed a clear magnitude range (e.g., +2‑5 % for Fed cuts, –2‑5 % for tech earnings miss, +1‑3 % for lower CPI + cuts, –3‑6 % for a Fed hike risk). Tighten each line to a single sentence that links the driver to spx via a causal chain: Fed cuts → lower short‑term yields → higher risk appetite → equity demand → spx +X %. Replace the generic “Fed policy statement” and “payrolls” references with the specific sources (B1KYJ1GPU, FAN5RYW6T) and ensure the probability sits at the end of the line, not in parentheses. Merge the first two items if they are essentially the same (Fed cuts) or differentiate them by specifying the CPI effect explicitly. Remove any drift by explicitly stating “spx” in each line and citing the concentration‑risk evidence (FAN5RYW6T, 56DSYR7J6). Finally, keep the format: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability % (e.g., Up | Sep 25‑Oct 15 | Fed rate cuts | Fed policy statement (B1KYJ1GPU) and early Sep payrolls (FAN5RYW6T) lift equity demand → spx +2‑5 % | 60 %).",
