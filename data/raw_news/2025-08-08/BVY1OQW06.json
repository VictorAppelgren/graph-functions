  "description": "What a tosser.",
  "content": "A North Carolina family was shocked when footage from their home security system captured what\u2019s being dubbed one of the worst Amazon delivery performances in recent memory.\n\nThe now-viral doorbell camera video, filmed in Cabarrus County, shows the driver delivering packages with an alarming lack of care.\n\nInstead of walking up to the porch and placing the items neatly by the door, the unidentified driver casually drops multiple boxes from a distance, letting them crash onto the steps and scatter across the entryway.\n\nOne of the packages appears unstable, prompting the driver to roughly shove it back up the steps instead of placing it with care.\n\nHe then lingers briefly at the porch, scanning a smaller package in his hand before walking away \u2014seemingly unfazed by the mess he just made.\n\nThe commotion startled the family, who were home at the time and heard a loud bang outside. When they stepped out to investigate, they discovered their packages strewn across the porch, some left precariously perched on the edge of the stairs.\n\nDisturbed by the incident, the family \u2014 who have chosen to remain anonymous \u2014 decided to release the footage to raise awareness about what they consider unacceptable delivery behavior.\n\nThe video has since sparked outrage online, with many viewers calling it one of the worst displays of delivery etiquette they\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nYet, this isn\u2019t the worst-behaved Amazon delivery driver the world has seen.\n\nA mischievous employee was axed earlier this year after she was caught on home surveillance video relieving herself on two front porches while dropping off packages in Los Angeles.\n\nThe gross stunt took place in the city\u2019s Woodland Hills area, with the unnamed driver caught literally with her pants down, according to KTLA-TV News.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply disturbed by the unacceptable behavior of this delivery driver and apologize to the customers involved,\u201d Amazon officials said in a statement to the outlet. \u201cWe immediately identified the driver and they are no longer delivering on behalf of Amazon.\u201d\n\nWhile that Amazon driver left an unwanted package, others have been caught taking them.\n\nA man captured the moment an Amazon delivery driver appeared to steal the package he\u2019d just delivered. Matthew Perry, 29, ordered a Bluetooth device for his car and a workout bench from Amazon, which cost $15 in total.\n\nIn the video, the delivery driver puts the package down and walks around the corner. But 30 seconds later, he returns to retrieve the items before running down the garden path.\n\nPerry was at work while his package was delivered and said he was shocked that someone would jeopardize their job for a $15 package.",

      "text": "Underrated town 3 hours outside of NYC has been tapped as a \u2018city on the rise\u2019 for its job openings and desirable salaries\nMove over, Manhattan \u2014 the hottest job markets may be just a train ride (or tank of gas) away.\nA new LinkedIn study has crowned America\u2019s \u201cCities on the Rise\u201d for jobs and talent \u2014 and some of the winners are closer to Times Square than Times Square is to affordable rent.\nWhile Grand Rapids, Michigan, took the top spot thanks to its growing tech scene and insurance boom, the real eyebrow-raiser for New Yorkers is Albany \u2014 the Empire State\u2019s own capital \u2014 landing at No. 4.\nYes, Albany. Once better known for politics and potholes than paychecks, the upstate hub \u2014 just a little under a 3-hour drive from NYC \u2014 is now a rising star in high-tech jobs and semiconductor research.\nThe University at Albany pumps more than $1 billion into the local economy, with top employers like Regeneron, a biotechnology company, and Albany Medical Center drawing talent \u2014 and paychecks averaging nearly $72,000.\nMedian home listings hover around $604,000, making it pricier than many upstate peers but still a bargain compared to NYC.\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: Albany didn\u2019t even nab the highest-ranking spot for a nearby market. That honor goes to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which somehow beat it at No. 3.\nPennsylvania\u2019s capital \u2014 about three hours from Midtown \u2014 scored high thanks to low cost of living, health care expansion and a tourism boost.\nWith median home home listings around $431,000 and an average income of $64,000, Harrisburg is attracting retirees and young professionals alike.\nBoise, Idaho, claimed No. 2 for its booming tech industry and mountain-town lifestyle, while Milwaukee, Wisconsin, rounded out the top five, buoyed by tech jobs and a surging tourism scene.\nLinkedIn said the ranking was based on hiring trends, job postings and talent migration \u2014 essentially, where Americans are packing up and moving for better career prospects without needing to sell a kidney for rent.\nThe full top 25 list shows that the action is increasingly in mid-sized metro areas \u2014 from semiconductor-fueled Sacramento, California, to biotech-booming Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina \u2014 not just in coastal megacities.\nLinkedIn\u2019s top 25 cities on the rise:\n- Grand Rapids, MI\n- Boise, ID\n- Harrisburg, PA\n- Albany, NY\n- Milwaukee, WI\n- Portland, ME\n- Myrtle Beach, SC\n- Hartford, CT\n- Nashville, TN\n- Omaha, NE\n- Kansas City, MO\n- Wilmington, NC\n- Richmond, VA\n- Indianapolis, IN\n- Colorado Springs, CO\n- Sacramento, CA\n- Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, SC\n- Austin, TX\n- Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, NC\n- Portland, OR\n- Fayetteville, AR\n- Reno, NV\n- San Antonio, TX\n- Fort Wayne, IN\n- Pensacola, FL\nSo if you\u2019re over subway delays and $20 cocktails, Albany might be calling. Just don\u2019t tell Harrisburg \u2014 they\u2019re still enjoying their victory lap.\nAnd if neither capital city strikes your fancy, there\u2019s always Long Island, where another community just nabbed bragging rights of its own.\nAs previously reported by The Post, New York\u2019s Massapequa Park was crowned the Empire State\u2019s best place to live in the latest U.S. News & World Report rankings \u2014 though it only came in at No. 140 nationwide.\nThe close-knit South Shore village scored points for its strong public schools, quick commute to NYC and nearby beach access, with homes selling for a median $746,500 \u2014 more than double the statewide median (excluding the city).\nLooks like the road to the good life might just run through the capital \u2014 or a Long Island cul-de-sac."

      "text": "Dear Abby: My mother-in-law won\u2019t stop taking my baby on joyrides \u2014 am I wrong to put my foot down?\nDEAR ABBY: My husband and I are blessed with a 6-month-old son, \u201cTyler.\u201d I\u2019m now back at work three days a week. My mother and my mother-in-law offered to watch him one day a week, which we were grateful for. (I found a baby-sitter for the third day.)\nI give my mom and my MIL gift cards to their favorite restaurants because each is giving up a day per week for us. My mom is very active and quite a bit younger than my MIL. Mom stays home with Tyler on the day she watches him (no errands, etc.).\nI asked my MIL if, on the day she watches Tyler, she can also stay home and not drive around to the library, grocery store and retail stores. I explained it interrupts the baby\u2019s nap schedule, and, because she isn\u2019t as physically in shape as my mom, it worries me how she\u2019s wrangling the car seat, stroller, etc. She promised she\u2019d just stay home and care for him and play with him.\nWell, Abby, she completely ignored me. I came to pick him up, and she was not even home. I was furious because this isn\u2019t the only time I have caught her running all over town with my infant. My husband also has asked her to stay put for one day out of the week.\nThe last time I picked up Tyler, I said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t stay home, we need to change this arrangement.\u201d Now my husband\u2019s side of the family is upset with me and thinks I was too harsh. What do you think? \u2014 NEW MOM IN MISSOURI\nDEAR MOM: I think that because your mother-in-law ignores your instructions about not taking your baby with her while running errands, you need to find someone else to take care of him on the days she used to do it. This is not being \u201ctoo harsh,\u201d it is protecting your little one. (No one said motherhood is easy.)\n** ** **\nDEAR ABBY: I have a friend who is an accomplished cook. I am not. She\u2019s very generous and shares her efforts often, but anytime I have given her some of my better efforts, she has given me feedback like, \u201cAdding some onion would really help this\u201d or \u201cWow, you didn\u2019t skimp on the chili powder!\u201d\nI finally decided to reciprocate by inviting her to lunches out. Now it\u2019s, \u201cThis sauce tastes like it came out of a bottle, mine is much better,\u201d or \u201cI tweaked my sister\u2019s recipe for this dish; I should give it to the chef.\u201d Frankly, I\u2019m tired of her estimation of her talents. I never killed anybody with my cooking, and her remarks when we\u2019re at a restaurant diminish my enjoyment. Any nice way to get her to simmer down? \u2014 OUTDONE IN TEXAS\nDEAR OUTDONE: I wonder if your friend\u2019s culinary talents are her only claim to fame. When she is critical of the food at the restaurants to which you take her, smile and say quietly, \u201cPicky, aren\u2019t we, today? I think this is delicious!\u201d It would be better than saying nothing and having a bad taste in your mouth.\n** ** **\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

      "text": "Move over, Starbucks and Dunkin\u2019 \u2014 this chain surprisingly has the cheapest coffee in America\nAn iced coffee can cost a latte these days, which can hurt the wallets of java junkies.\nTo not overspend on a coffee-a-day habit \u2014 or some might call it an addiction \u2014 a reporter at Delish looked at nine different fast-food and fast-casual menus to find the cheapest iced coffee in America.\nThe outlet discovered that Burger King reigns supreme when it comes to having the cheapest coffee in America. You can\u2019t beat a $1.99 coffee in this economy.\nWendy\u2019s came in at No. 2 with their offering of a $2.49 cold brew. Even if you want something more indulgent, a caramel cold foam is under $3.50.\nMany people probably thought it was safe to assume that McDonald\u2019s was the cheapest coffee option. Not exactly, but it did come in at third place on the list.\nTheir coffee is so beloved because the blend is made specifically for McDonald\u2019s \u2014 and with a price tag of $2.79, it\u2019s hard to beat.\nPeople tend to gravitate toward Taco Bell for some late-night munchies, but don\u2019t negate them when it comes to their breakfast. How could you pass up a $3.04 coffee?\nStop at Sonic for a sweet treat and a little caffeine boost. The chain doesn\u2019t technically serve regular iced coffee \u2014 but they do offer a delicious cold brew with sweet cream on the menu for #3.59.\nIt\u2019s common to assume Starbucks is on the pricier side, especially considering that the more customizations you get, the more expensive the drink is.\nDespite the complicated orders and secret menu items, a regular tall (small) classic iced coffee is just $4.25, which is pretty reasonable \u2014 especially in comparison to other Starbucks drinks.\nPeople rave about Chick-fil-A\u2019s iced coffee taste \u2014 and it\u2019s a pretty good deal, too. Talk about a win-win.\nNo matter what customizations you make to it, the iced coffee will always cost only $4.99, according to Delish. Make that a large triple-iced mocha espresso, please.\nThe size of Panera\u2019s iced coffee is a huge appeal, but it comes out to one of the pricier options.\nA regular iced coffee will cost you a whopping $5.19, which is definitely pricey for a fast-casual restaurant.\nAmerica does not run on Dunkin\u2019. The beloved chain actually came in as the most expensive option on the list.\nDepending on where you live, a small iced coffee of the original blend will set you back an average of around $5.31 \u2014 no matter if you get it black or with cream and sugar, the outlet found."

His post quickly gained traction with nearly 30,000 likes and over 4,000 comments.\nRichardson\u2019s concerns resonated with many Gen Xers and Boomers, who echoed his sentiment that ageism is a real barrier in today\u2019s job market.\nSome pointed to the added challenges faced by older workers from marginalized communities, where their race, gender and sexuality further worsen the discrimination.\nA survey conducted by resume-building site Resume Now proved all of their worries to be true. It pointed out that, sadly, 90% of workers over the age of 40 have experienced ageism in the workplace, and almost half of the respondents witnessed their employer hiring predominantly young workers.\nMany people empathized with the Gen Xer in the comment section of his viral video.\n\u201cI\u2019m 46 and I\u2019m already feeling it in my industry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m 42 and I feel this hard.\u201d\nOthers insisted their skills remain valuable and said they continue to find work with companies that prioritize experience and reliability.\n\u201cI was thinking the very same at the age of 58 I needed to find work. Took a few months but it happened. Best company ever. I\u2019m old enough to be everyone\u2019s father but they love me and I love them.\u201d\n\u201cI just hired a 60 and 63 yo because they were amazing candidates. Age doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cI got a job at 62. I just turned 65, told the company I think I want to retire. They told me \u201cyou can\u2019t leave us\u201d and handed me an 8% raise. Good people can always get a job at any age!\u201d\nIf you think you are experiencing ageism where you work \u2014 maybe you got laid off due to your age or passed up for a promotion by a younger colleague \u2014 Midtown East attorney Albert Rizzo suggests speaking to an employment attorney.\n\u201cAn attorney will want to understand what actions the employer has taken and whether those actions were based on the employee\u2019s age,\u201d said Rizzo.\n\u201cAny adverse action may create a viable claim. These actions can include failure to promote, denial of privileges given to other employees, exclusion from meetings and projects.\u201d"
