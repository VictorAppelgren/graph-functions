  "description": "President Trump's approval ratings nationally are low, but in Indiana and about half the other states, more people approve than disapprove of him.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump's approval ratings nationally are in the red, but in about half of the states, including Indiana, more people approve than disapprove of his job performance.\n\nWhile Trump's approval rating nationally remains historically low, a look at state-by-state survey results show a more complicated picture. Here is what we know:\n\nTrump's approval rating is above water in 27 states, according to an Aug. 12 update from Morning Consult, which gathers polls over the course of three months to get a look at state-level data among registered voters. The number of states who approve of Trump is unchanged from July's update.\n\nMorning Consult found that Trump is most popular in Wyoming, where 66% of voters approve of his job performance, and least popular in Vermont, where 64% disapprove.\n\nHis approval is net negative in two states with gubernatorial races this fall: New Jersey and Virginia, according to Morning Consult.\n\nIn Texas, 53% of voters approve of Trump's performance while 44% disapprove. In California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has threatened to counter changes in Texas' redistricting plan, 41% approve of Trump's job peformance while 56% disapprove. California is Trump's seventh worst rating among the states, according to Morning Consult.\n\nWhat is Trump's approval rating in Indiana?\n\nAccording to Morning Consult, 51% of Hoosiers approve of Trump while 45% disapprove.\n\nDespite recent \"No Kings\" and \"Good Trouble\" protests, Indiana is one of the 27 states where Trump's approval ratings are more positive than not.\n\nWhat is Trump's approval overall?\n\nRealClearPolitics Poll Average shows Trump's approval rating dipping throughout the first few weeks of July before rising toward the end of the month. Aggregated polls by the New York Times show a similar trend.\n\nAs of Jan. 27, Trump had a +6.2 percentage point approval rating, but as of March 13, that flipped to slightly negative, the RealClearPolitics graphics show. His approval rating fell lowest on April 29 around Trump's 100-day mark to 7.2 percentage points. It came close to that low again on July 22 and 23 at -7.1 percentage points, as the controversy over Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted pedophile, carried into its third week.\n\nAs of Aug. 12 Trump's average approval rating margin, according to RealClearPolitics, is -5.4 percentage points. The approval margin according to the New York Times aggregator on Aug. 12 is -8 percentage points.\n\nHow does Trump's approval rating compare to previous presidents?\n\nA historical analysis by Gallup shows Trump's approval ratings in July of his first years in office \u2014 both as the 45th and 47th presidents \u2014 are lower than those of any other modern president at the same time in their administrations.\n\nIn a Gallup poll conducted from July 7-21, 37% approved of Trump's job performance. Here's how that compares to other presidents in July of their first year of their term, according to Gallup:\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

      "text": "Trump's Epstein problem grows: Even his voters want more files released\nJeffrey Epstein is one of the rare issues where Trump appears to be out of step with his base by questioning why public interest remains in the case.\nLoretta Duchesne doesn\u2019t have much faith in the government, and that\u2019s part of the reason she cast a ballot last November for Donald Trump.\nThe 35-year-old makeup artist from northern Louisiana said she felt Trump would be \u201ctransparent\u201d and \u201cexpose corruption.\u201d She\u2019s disappointed that the Trump administration isn\u2019t releasing all the records in the Jeffrey Epstein case.\n\u201cIt feels now more like he\u2019s protecting someone or something if he won\u2019t reveal it,\u201d said Duchesne, an independent who once voted for President Barack Obama.\nDuchesne likes Trump policies such as his stance on the border and doesn\u2019t regret voting for him. But when it comes to Epstein, she said she doesn\u2019t accept the official narrative about the wealthy financier who died in prison awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges and also believes the administration is making a mistake and undermining its credibility by holding material back on the years-old criminal case involving alleged underage victims.\nMost Trump voters interviewed by USA TODAY share Duchesne\u2019s desire to see more Epstein records released, illustrating why the case has become so problematic for a second-term president who has a long, documented history of associating with Epstein and recently has publicly questioned why there remains such a deep interest in a man who died six years ago.\nEpstein is one of the rare issues where Trump appears to be out of step with his base.\nUSA TODAY spoke with seven Trump supporters, and most believe there is more to be revealed about Epstein and want to see the government be more forthcoming with its documentation of his case. Their suspicions persist despite the Department of Justice releasing a memo July 7 that tried to close the book on the Epstein saga.\nNew York's chief medical examiner ruled Epstein's death a suicide, but some \u2013 including many Trump loyalists \u2013 have questioned that finding and whether the government is shielding Epstein's potential clients from public view.\nThe DOJ memo reaffirmed the finding that Epstein died by suicide, said there is no \u201cincriminating client list\u201d and no evidence he blackmailed prominent people. But instead of dispelling speculation about the case, the memo only inflamed things further, putting the administration in the hot seat.\nUtah resident Shar Kynaston, 75, said she doesn\u2019t think Epstein killed himself and believes \"he probably had a preferred, high-paying list\u201d of clients.\n\u201cI think that there is a cover-up, but I don\u2019t know the extent of it,\u201d said Kynaston, a retired federal worker who voted for Trump in all three of his presidential races in 2016, 2020 and 2024.\nKynaston wants the Epstein files released, but she still likes Trump. The same goes for Victoria Rivas, 20, a Miami University student and vice president of the Ohio college\u2019s Republican club.\n\u201cI do think we deserve transparency,\u201d Rivas said.\nTrump recently pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of Epstein grand jury testimony, which the DOJ is doing. But that\u2019s just a portion of the records that haven\u2019t been released and it\u2019s not enough for Rivas, a Trump voter who attended the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last year when he officially became the party\u2019s nominee, just days after he was shot in an assassination attempt.\n\u201cThat\u2019s very picky and choosy,\u201d Rivas said of just releasing grand jury testimony, adding that all the Epstein records should be released.\nRivas views the first six months of Trump\u2019s second term as \u201ca lot of promises made and a lot of promises kept,\u201d but on Epstein she said he\u2019s falling short.\nPart of the problem for Trump is that those around him, including high-profile figures in his administration, spent years hyping up the potential for bombshell revelations in the Epstein files.\n\"Show us all the Epstein client list now!!!\u201d Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., posted on X in 2023. \u201cWhy would anyone protect those scum bags? Ask yourselves this question daily and the answer becomes very apparent!!\u201d\nThe president was more circumscribed in his Epstein comments.\nResponding in June 2024 to a Fox News interviewer who asked whether he would declassify the files, Trump said: \u201cYeah, yeah, I would. I guess I would.\u201d But he added: \u201cI think that less so, because you don\u2019t know \u2212 You don\u2019t want to affect people\u2019s lives if there\u2019s phony stuff in there, because there\u2019s a lot of phony stuff in that whole world. But I think I would.\u201d\nSome Trump supporters who spoke to USA TODAY said there was an expectation that more would be revealed.\n\u201cIt all has to come out,\u201d Rivas said.\nThe backlash Trump is receiving on Epstein has raised questions about whether it will dent his image among his base and could potentially be a drag for Republicans in the 2026 midterm election. Rivas doesn't see the issue as \"a top concern for our country,\" and other Trump supporters said the same.\nPennsylvania home builder Mark Bass, 65, said he doesn\u2019t think Epstein killed himself, doesn\u2019t accept that there isn\u2019t a client list and believes the administration should release more information. Still, Bass is \u201cecstatic\u201d about Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s done a fantastic job, he\u2019s done more than he\u2019s said he\u2019s going to do, and I don\u2019t think this will make any difference whatsoever,\u201d said Bass, a Republican who voted for Trump in each of the last three elections.\nTrump has struggled to shake off the Epstein issue, though, and after initially lashing out at supporters who questioned his administration's handling of the case, the president and his team have been seeking ways to placate critics. DOJ officials announced July 22 that they will seek to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein associate found guilty of aiding his abuse.\nDuchesne, the Louisiana makeup artist, said she\u2019s moderately disappointed in Trump\u2019s handling of the Epstein case. If the truth is so \u201cvanilla\u201d then why not just release the records, she wondered.\n\u201cIt makes me look at you sideways,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re deflecting. Why aren\u2019t you just releasing?\u201d\nContributing: Aysha Bagchi"

Poll shows most Americans disapprove of Epstein approach\n- Trump's approval ratings reached new lows in his second term, according to some pollsters, amid controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case.\n- An Economist/YouGov poll found 61% of respondents disapproved of Trump's handling of the Epstein investigation, while 82% believe the government should release all related documents.\n- Trump's approval ratings in July of both his first and second terms are lower than any other modern president at the same point in their administrations, according to Gallup.\nThe ongoing controversy around Jeffrey Epstein has roiled the Trump administration for weeks, and at least one poll shows most Americans are not approving of how it is being handled.\nThe Justice Department on July 7 released a memo saying no further disclosure of the criminal case documents was needed after teasing a \"truckload\" of Epstein files in March. In a rare moment of discord among Trump's supporters, many Republicans have pushed for more transparency around the files.\nPresident Donald Trump's approval rating in his second term did not fall as far as quickly compared to his first term. But between both terms, his ratings have been the lowest in modern history. Late July polls from Reuters/Ipsos and Economist/YouGov show this is a particularly challenging time for the president as his approval ratings hit new lows in his second term.\nHere is what to know:\nWhat is Trump's approval rating?\nRealClearPolitics Poll Average shows Trump's approval rating was becoming more negative throughout the first few weeks of July before buoying in the last week.

It came close to that low again on July 22 and 23 at -7.1 percentage points, as the controversy over Epstein carried into its third week.\nHis average approval rating margin as of Aug. 4, according to RealClearPolitics, is -4.8 percentage points. The approval margin according to the New York Times aggregator on Aug. 4 is -8 percentage points.\nEconomist/YouGov poll shows Americans' response to Epstein files\nControversy over late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his criminal case files has dogged the Trump administration for weeks, as both political parties have called for more transparency.\nIn an Economist/YouGov poll conducted July 25-28, 61% of respondents disapproved of Trump's handling of the investigation versus 21% who approve.\nThe survey also found 82% of Americans believe the government should release all the documents it has on the case.\nTrump's overall approval rating was -15 percentage points in this poll, which surveyed 1,777 U.S. adult citizens and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. That is the lowest approval rating Trump has seen from this poll in his second term.\nTrump's approval rating is low compared to other presidents\nA historical analysis by Gallup shows Trump's approval ratings in July of his first years in office \u2212 both as the 45th and 47th presidents \u2212 are lower than any other modern president at the same time in their administrations.\nIn a Gallup poll conducted from July 7-21, 37% approved of Trump's job performance.

      "text": "'Time to wake up': more than 4,000 Hoosiers protest Trump administration at Statehouse\nThe Indianapolis \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest in opposition to President Donald Trump drew more than 4,000 people from across the state to the Indiana Statehouse on June 14.\nOrganized by the volunteer-led 50501 movement, the peaceful protest focused on Trump\u2019s policies surrounding immigration, the LGBTQ+ community, and deep cuts to federal spending by the Department of Government Efficiency. Many protesters criticized Trump\u2019s disregard for democratic processes, citing times when he\u2019s insulted judges and attempted to circumvent their orders.\nThe rally in Indianapolis was one of more than 1,500 across the country and took place ahead of Trump\u2019s $40 million military parade in Washington, D.C., to celebrate the U.S. Army\u2019s 250th birthday.\nProtesters withstood a deluge of rain and humidity to hear speakers who ranged from veterans to state lawmakers. An organizer told IndyStar that they had counted 4,158 protesters with a clicker when protesters first started marching shortly after noon, but said many stayed behind on the lawn and were not counted. Organizers estimated there were an additional 2,000-3,000 attendees throughout the course of the event.\nOne protester detained in dispute with counter-protester\nIndianapolis police detained a protester just 20 minutes into the event when the protester ripped a pro-Trump flag from a counter-protester. The counter-protester chased the man, falling and scuffing his elbow and knee.\nIndyStar reporters did not see any other significant disputes during the three-hour event. Organizers encouraged protesters to remain peaceful, pointing to a bucket of whistles for protesters to use to alert others if they landed in a confrontation.\nNo paid agitators, state organizer says\nScott Johnson, state organizer for the 50501 movement, wore a shirt with the words \u201cunpaid protester,\u201d a nod to the familiar claim that protesters are paid to attend political events.\nJohnson, 57, said he funded the event with his own money and that none of the attendees were paid.\nThe Fishers resident attended his first protest in February, when he saw a 50501 organizer handing out snacks. He offered the organizer money for the snacks and quickly became connected with the movement, becoming the state organizer when the previous leader left.\nJohnson said it\u2019s one of the best things that\u2019s ever happened to him.\n\u201cIt felt like I had found a home,\u201d he said.\nProtesters come from an array of backgrounds\nA Vietnam war veteran. A first-generation American. A former Trump voter.\nIndyStar spoke with people who had a variety of reasons for attending the June 14 protest.\nOne was safety and security volunteer Joe Stuteville, a 68-year-old Vietnam veteran and former military police officer from Indianapolis. He said he fears democracy is in danger.\n\u201cThis has been sneaking up on us for years and people have been sleeping,\u201d he said. \u201cTime to wake up.\u201d\nStuteville said he views the size of the military parade in Washington, D.C., as unnecessary.\n\"Speaking as a veteran, we don't need military parades,\" he said. Instead, many veterans carry a sense of pride and honor within, he said.\nAnother protester, Janet Orozco, held an anti-MAGA sign written in Spanish.\n\u201cAs a first-(generation American), I want to represent those before me,\u201d she told IndyStar through tears. \u201cIt\u2019s personal for me.\u201d\nThough protesters were united against Trump\u2019s actions, their political ideologies differed.\nLeland Lindahl, an independent, said he voted for Trump in 2020.\n\u201cAs soon as January 6 hit, I immediately regretted it,\u201d Lindahl said.\nThe 47-year-old from Noblesville grew up in a conservative, Christian community and voted for Republicans throughout his life. His first time voting for a Democrat was in 2024.\nWhile he doesn\u2019t agree with everything some of the protesters believe, Lindahl said he came to the Statehouse because he didn\u2019t want to sit on his couch and complain \u2014 he wanted to take action.\nCrowd remains despite downpour\nWhat was a smattering of rain throughout the event became a persistent downpour shortly before 2 p.m. The crowd remained, albeit reduced, with people seeking refuge under trees, umbrellas and ponchos.\nAnnie Bowling, 46, was one of hundreds of protesters who withstood the weather.\n\u201cThis is a testament to people in Indiana, one of the reddest states,\u201d she said, holding a rain-soaked sign that had stained her hands red. \u201cThat shows you that we will not be deterred by some weather because we know what's at stake.\u201d\nBowling drove to Indianapolis from Bloomington to attend both the protest and Indy Pride, which took place the same day, to, as she said, stand up for the LGBTQ community and other people at risk due to Trump\u2019s policies.\n\u201cThey're coming for everyone and everyone\u2019s freedoms and everyone\u2019s rights,\u201d Bowling said. \u201cThe sooner people realize that and stand up for that, the better chance we have stopping this in early stages.\u201d"

      "text": "Presidential approval rating\nThis is a daily average of polls conducted by dozens of different organizations since Inauguration Day. See the latest polls.\nIn recent weeks, President Trump has taken a series of actions that have irritated or even angered his base. More than one-third of Republicans disapprove of how he handled the files related to Jeffrey Epstein, according to a recent poll from Quinnipiac University. And among voters who approve of Trump\u2019s job performance, 41 percent think he has not gone far enough in reducing everyday prices.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean his supporters are breaking with him. His numbers have remained particularly strong with Republicans, around 90 percent of whom continue to approve of his job performance. And 93 percent of Trump approvers say his approach has been necessary to shake up things in Washington.\nCompare with past presidents\nThese charts show how President Trump\u2019s net approval rating compares with the net approval of past presidents. Net approval is the percentage of survey respondents who approve of the president minus the percentage who disapprove.\nJoe Biden vs. Trump\nTrump: first term vs. second\nBarack Obama vs. Trump\nGeorge W. Bush vs. Trump\nIt is typical for new presidents to experience a decline in support in the first few months of their presidencies.

Results can vary because of the inherent challenges of polling \u2014 surveys can only be expected to be accurate within a couple of percentage points \u2014 or because polls were conducted using different methods and at different times. One of the reasons examining an average of polls can be so useful is it can balance out these differences and make it easier to analyze change over time."

Alligator Alcatraz is in the spotlight for his ongoing effort to carry out mass deportations. His administration has been battling the controversy over Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking case files for weeks. Epstein and Trump were friends back when they both lived in the Palm Beach area.\nIn addition to legally contentious, many of Trump's actions have been unpopular as he maintains the lowest approval ratings in modern history, with the exception of his own record set in 2017.\nSo what do Floridians, his own neighbors, think of how he is doing as president?\nWhat is Trump's approval rating in Florida?\nIn Florida, 53% of poll respondents approve of Trump's job performance compared to 44% who disapprove. That is according to an Aug. 12 update from Morning Consult, which gathers polls over the course of three months to get a look at state-level data among registered voters. Those numbers are unchanged from July's update.\nFlorida is among 27 states where Trump has received a net positive approval rating, also unchanged from July.

The approval rating reached its most negative on April 29 at -7.2 percentage points, which fell around Trump's 100-day mark. It came close to that low again on July 22 and 23 at -7.1 percentage points, as the controversy over Epstein carried into its third week.\nHis average approval rating margin as of Aug. 12, according to RealClearPolitics, is -5.4 percentage points.

The most favorable state is Wyoming (66% approval) and the most unfavorable is Vermont (64% disapproval). Trump\u2019s approval is negative in New Jersey and Virginia, both key gubernatorial races, and his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case has further eroded support, especially among his base. Gallup data indicate his July approval in his first years in office is lower than any other modern president at the same point in their terms.",
