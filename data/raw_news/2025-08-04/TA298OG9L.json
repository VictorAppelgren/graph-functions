  "title": "Everton: Transfers expected but pre-season performance a concern",
  "description": "David Moyes expects deals to be done this week - but Everton's pre-season results are a concern.",
  "content": "By his own admission, David Moyes is not immediately drawn to Snoop Dogg's music.\n\nBut there is a sentence in one of the best-selling and influential rap artists of all time's most famous songs that probably sums up Moyes' mood at the moment.\n\nHalfway through Drop It Like It's Hot, Snoop declares \"I can't fake it\".\n\nMoyes saw Snoop perform at the Super Bowl on his previous visit to Atlanta in 2019. The event was memorable - the game, according to the Scot, was not, as the New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams, Snoop's team, 13-3.\n\nOn Sunday, at the magnificent Mercedes Benz Stadium, a 2-2 draw with Manchester United was better as far as Moyes' Everton side were concerned.\n\nIt meant they finished with one point, and bottom of the Premier League Summer Series table. Having lost their previous three pre-season matches, the results are starting to be a concern - Moyes can't fake it.\n\nIt certainly is not what most Evertonians felt the situation would be as they prepare for their eagerly awaited final test event in their new home against Roma on Saturday.\n\nWith a new stadium, ambitious new owners and a manager who understood them, this was meant to be the start of a new era.\n\nYet Moyes' final press conference at the Premier League Summer Series centred on a familiar theme.\n\n\"I think there'll be deals next week,\" he said. \"I think we're getting much closer. But I felt that four or five weeks ago as well.\n\n\"Obviously, we're getting near the tickly bits and we've got to get some things done.\"",
