  "description": "Goodyear announced that its financial results for the second quarter of 2025 didn't meet its expectations, citing tariffs and inflation as factors.",
  "content": "\u2022 Goodyear announced that its financial results for the second quarter of 2025 didn't meet its expectations, citing tariffs and inflation as factors.\n\u2022 The Akron-based company tentatively plans to make changes in its supply chain to reduce tariff impacts and is encouraging trade partners to participate in the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\u2022 Goodyear is continuing with planned layoffs. The company laid off about 80 employees in its Americas and Corporate divisions months ago, and most of those positions were based in Akron.\n\nThe Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. has told federal regulators it expects to initiate at least 1,800 layoffs in 2025 as it wrestles with rising tariffs and the effects of inflation.\n\nAbout 750 of these cuts were initiated in the first half of the year, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show \u2014 including 80 or fewer positions based at its Akron headquarters, a Goodyear spokesperson confirmed Aug. 11. The layoffs also include roughly 900 employed and contracted jobs in South Africa.\n\nThe company said during an Aug. 8 earnings call that its second-quarter results did not meet expectations. Goodyear reported an adjusted net loss of $48 million for the quarter ending June 30, down year-over-year from $48 million in adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe company's reported loss per share of 17 cents for the second quarter of 2025 was 54 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a 37-cent-per-share gain.\n\nThe stock has taken a hit since the quarterly earnings were announced Aug. 7 after the close of trading. As of 2:20 p.m. Aug. 12, its value had dropped $1.85 or nearly 18% over the last five days to $8.40.\n\nGoodyear's annualized tariff costs equate to about $350 million, Christina Zamarro, the company's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said on an earnings call on Aug. 8.\n\nThat's $50 million above the estimated $300 million in annualized tariff costs that Goodyear reported in May, when it announced results for the first quarter of 2025.\n\nFor the third quarter, Zamarro said, \"Inflation, tariffs and other costs are expected to be a headwind of approximately $180 million, reflecting higher costs given U.S. tariffs impacts and a global inflation rate of about 3%. This amount captures above-average increases in freight rates and transitory manufacturing costs associated with announced facility closures. We expect this amount to increase in the fourth quarter.\"\n\nGoodyear raised prices in the U.S. and Canada due to tariffs, company President and CEO Mark Stewart said on the call.\n\nZamarro said Goodyear will likely \"will make adjustments to our supply chain\" to reduce the risk of tariffs on the company's profit and loss statement for the remainder of 2024.\n\nGoodyear has talked with multiple partners in the supply chain about participating in more trade involving the United States, Mexico and Canada under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Stewart said.\n\nShippers of goods between the three North American countries can claim \"preferential treatment\" under the trade agreement, which was passed during President Donald Trump's first term, depending on how much of those goods were produced in the countries from which they are exported, according to Canada's Trade Commissioner Service.\n\nAside from the 1,800 layoffs initiated in 2025, Goodyear also ended the employment of about 700 employees in the first half of 2025 \"under plans initiated in prior years,\" the filing said.\n\nGoodyear also approved a plan in the second quarter to close a manufacturing facility in Kariega, South Africa, which includes the planned elimination of 900 employed and contracted positions, according to the SEC filing.\n\n\"Approximately 2,700 associates remain to be released under all ongoing rationalization plans,\" the filing said.\n\nThe 2,700 number includes layoffs at the South Africa facility and layoffs at a plant in Danville, Virginia, that the company announced in January, the Goodyear spokesperson said.\n\nGoodyear has about 68,000 employees, including roughly 2,500 at its Akron headquarters, the spokesperson said.\n\nPatrick Williams covers growth and development for the Akron Beacon Journal.

      "text": "Goodyear optimistic its tangle with tariffs will be less expensive than competitors'\n- Goodyear leaders sayefforts to cut costs and strengthen U.S. operations are improving its finances with new import and export tariffs in effect.\n- Tariffs on finished goods and raw materials are expected to cost Goodyear about $300 million annually, according to a company investor presentation.\n- One of Goodyear's cost-cutting measures was the sale of Dunlop to Sumitomo Rubber Industries. The deal closed on May 7, with Goodyear receiving cash proceeds of $735 million.\nThe Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company on May 7 completed the sale of the Dunlop tire brand and announced that its efforts to shave costs and strengthen its U.S. operations are improving its financial outlook amid global trade uncertainties.\nAkron-based Goodyear, which has operations around the world and engages in international trade, is not impervious to tariffs, estimating $300 million in annual costs due to tariffs in a May 8 investor report.\nAfter the close of the stock market on May 7, the Akron-headquartered rubber company reported segment operating income of $195 million for the first quarter of 2025, down from $247 million in segment operating income for the same period a year ago.\nIn response to rising costs, the company confirmed with the Beacon Journal in April that it is increasing prices on consumer tires in the United States and Canada.\nPrice increases of 4% took effect on Goodyear's U.S. tire sales May 1, Christina Zamarro, Goodyear executive vice president and chief financial officer, said on a May 8 earnings call.\nYear-to-date, Goodyear stock has outpaced that of the \"Big Three\" U.S. car manufacturers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Goodyear has seen a nearly 30% percentage gain since Jan. 1, compared to a less-than-10% gain for Ford and losses for GM and Stellantis.\nGoodyear stock closed May 8 at $10.94 per share, down 7 cents (0.64%).\nHow do tariffs affect Goodyear's financial outlook?\nTariffs on finished goods and raw materials are expected to cost Goodyear about $300 million annually, according to a company investor presentation.\n\"When you look at the $300 million that we laid out, I\u2019d say you could think about 80% of that flowing through into our consumer business,\" Zamarro said. \"That equates to about $4 per tire. And I think that based on our analysis of the competitive set, our competitors will be anywhere in the area of three to four times that level of exposure.\"\nMark Stewart, Goodyear president and CEO, said on the call that company leadership assumes continued supply chain delays with imports from Southeast Asia.\n\"The timing is right to evolve and to build out our product portfolio,\" Stewart said. \"Likewise, the timing is right ... for the ramp-up of our U.S. factory modernization programs, increasing our capacity by 10 million additional premium tires this year in '25 and next year in '26.\"\nWhat other finances did Goodyear report?\nFor adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2025, which are diluted, the company reported a 4-cent loss.\nZacks Investment Research published a 6-cent loss forecast for the quarter in its Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nMore broadly, Zacks ranks the rubber tire industry in the top 8% of industries, at 20 out of 246 ranked industries.\nHowever, the company reported gains in income before income taxes and net income year over year, landing at $131 million and $115 million, respectively, for 1Q 2025. In 1Q 2024, Goodyear reported a $52 million loss in income before income taxes and a $57 million loss in net income.\nGoodyear finalizes Dunlop sale\nAt closing for the sale of Dunlop to Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Goodyear received gross cash proceeds of $735 million, according to a news release.\nGoodyear will manufacture, sell and distribute Dunlop-branded consumer tires in Europe through the end of 2025, paying a royalty to Sumitomo during the transition period but retaining all profits from the sales, Zamarro said.\nPatrick Williams covers growth and development for the Akron Beacon Journal.

      "text": "As of March 7, 2025, United States (U.S.) International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (i.e., border and fentanyl) tariffs have been paused for goods imported from Canada that qualify for duty-free preferential treatment under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).\nFor the vast majority of goods (over 98% of tariff lines and over 99.9% of bilateral trade between Canada and the U.S.), traders can claim preference under the CUSMA if they meet the Agreement\u2019s rules of origin.\nTo qualify for preferential treatment when imported into the U.S., a good must meet the CUSMA rules of origin, which determine how much production must be undertaken in North America for goods to be considered originating under the Agreement.\nIf a good meets the rules of origin, it is not automatically granted duty-free tariff treatment. This benefit must be claimed by the importer on the basis of a certification of origin. Goods that do not satisfy the rules of origin are considered non-originating and are not eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement.\nSome Canadian exporters have not sought preferential treatment under the CUSMA, because they previously traded with the U.S. under the broader tariff regime applicable to all World Trade Organization members (Most-Favoured Nation trade status), often with very low or zero tariff rates. These goods are now subject to the U.S. IEEPA (border and fentanyl) tariffs unless they meet the CUSMA rules of origin and make a claim for preferential tariff treatment."
