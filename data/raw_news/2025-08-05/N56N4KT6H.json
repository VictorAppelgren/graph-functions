      "text": "How we\u2019re making data centers more flexible to benefit power grids\nTechnologies like AI are poised to spur a new wave of innovation and economic growth \u2014 and meeting AI\u2019s energy needs efficiently and reliably also presents a unique opportunity to modernize our entire energy system.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been working to bring flexible demand capabilities into our data center fleet, which enables us to shift or reduce power demand during certain hours or times of the year. These capabilities, often referred to as demand response, have several advantages, especially as we continue to see electricity growth in the US and elsewhere. It allows large electricity loads like data centers to be interconnected more quickly, helps reduce the need to build new transmission and power plants, and helps grid operators more effectively and efficiently manage power grids.\nWe\u2019re pleased to report on our progress in the implementation of these capabilities, including two new utility agreements with Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). These agreements represent the first time we\u2019re delivering data center demand response by targeting machine learning (ML) workloads. This builds on our successful demonstration with Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) where we reduced the power demand associated with ML workloads during three grid events last year \u2014 paving the way for us to pursue opportunities at other locations.\n\u201cI&M is excited to partner with Google to enable demand response capabilities at their new data center in Fort Wayne, IN. As we add new large loads to our system, it is critical that we partner with our customers to effectively manage the generation and transmission resources necessary to serve them. Google\u2019s ability to leverage load flexibility as part of the strategy to serve their load will be a highly valuable tool to meet their future energy needs,\u201d said Steve Baker, president and chief operating officer of I&M.\nDelivering flexibility to strengthen grids\nAdvancing Google\u2019s 24/7 carbon-free energy ambition requires a holistic approach, to both procure clean energy and support the grid through demand-side solutions. Flexible demand is an important piece of this portfolio \u2014 it can be deployed quickly, helping bridge the gap between short-term load growth and long-term clean energy solutions, and delivers immediate benefits.\nThe first data center demand response capabilities we developed involve shifting non-urgent compute tasks \u2014 like processing a YouTube video \u2014 during specific periods when the grid is strained. Through our ongoing partnerships with Centrica Energy and transmission system operator Elia in Belgium, and Taiwan Power Company in Taiwan, we've leveraged this capability to help grid operators maintain reliability during those periods of the year when demand is the highest.\nAs AI adoption accelerates, we see a significant opportunity to expand our demand response toolkit, develop capabilities specifically for ML workloads, and leverage them to manage large new energy loads. By including load flexibility in our overall energy plan, we can manage AI-driven growth even where power generation and transmission are constrained. We believe this is a promising tool for managing large new energy loads and facilitating investment and growth.\nEvolving for future energy needs\nData center demand flexibility is still in the early stages and will only be available at certain locations. There are limits to how flexible a given data center can be, since high levels of reliability are critical for services like Search and Maps, as well as Cloud customers in essential industries like healthcare.\nIncorporating ML workloads is an important step to enable larger scale demand flexibility, delivering grid reliability and cost-saving benefits in the places where these capabilities are deployed. By engaging in long-term resource planning with utility partners like I&M and TVA, we can integrate flexibility into future grid development alongside Google\u2019s data center infrastructure deployment.\nManaging data center load growth will require a portfolio of solutions, including new generation and transmission investments, but demand response can play an important role. Looking forward, we remain committed to collaborating with system operators, utilities, and industry partners to capture AI\u2019s immense opportunity while supporting a clean, reliable, and affordable energy system for everyone."

      "text": "AI\u2019s energy demands are surging \u2013 the grid needs to catch up\nAI needs a more resilient power grid\nAs AI models grow larger and more capable, the supporting infrastructure must evolve in tandem. AI\u2019s insatiable appetite has Big Tech going as far as restarting nuclear power plants to support massive new datacenters, which today account for as much as 2% of global electricity consumption, or more than the entire country of Germany.\nBut the humble power grid is where we need to start.\nConstructing the computing superstructure to support AI tools will significantly alter the demand curve for energy and put increasing strain on electrical grids. As AI embraces more complex workloads across both training and inference, compute needs \u2013 and thereby power consumption \u2013 are expected to increase exponentially. Some forecasts suggest that datacenter electricity consumption could increase to as much as 12% of the global total by 2030.\nSemiconductors form the cornerstone of AI computing infrastructure. The chipmaking industry has focused primarily on expanding renewable energy sources and delivering improvements in energy-efficient computing technologies. These are necessary but not sufficient \u2013 they cannot sustainably support the enormous energy requirements demanded by the growth of AI. We need to build a more resilient power grid.\nCorporate Vice President at Applied Materials.\nMoving from Sustainability to Sustainable Abundance\nIn a new report, we call for a different paradigm \u2013 sustainable energy abundance \u2013 which will be achieved not by sacrificing growth, but by constructing a holistic energy strategy to power the next generation of computing. The report represents the work of major companies across the AI technology stack, from chip design and manufacturing to cloud service providers, as well as thought leaders from the energy and finance sectors.\nThe foundational pillar of this new strategy is grid decarbonization. Although not a new concept, in the AI era it requires an approach that integrates decarbonization with energy abundance, ensuring AI\u2019s productivity gains are not sidelined by grid constraints. In practical terms, this entails embracing traditional energy sources like oil and gas, while gradually transitioning toward cleaner sources such as nuclear, hydro, geothermal, solar and wind. Doing this effectively requires understanding of the upgrades needed for the electricity grid to enable rapid integration of existing and new energy sources.\nConsuming electricity from the grid naturally assumes the emissions profile of the grid itself. It should come as no surprise that emissions related to the grid represent the single biggest component of the emissions bill facing any given company. In the conventional approach to sustainability, companies focused more on offsetting emissions derived from the grid rather than sourcing the grid with cleaner (or carbon-free) energy. To support the coming scale-out of AI infrastructure, access to a clean grid will be one of the most important aspects in reducing carbon footprint.\nStrategically selecting locations for datacenters and semiconductor fabs will be critical. Countries and regions have a varying mix of clean energy in the power grid, which impacts their carbon emission profile. For example, the United States and France generate a similar percentage of their overall electricity from renewable sources. However, the United States has a significantly higher country emission factor, which represents the direct carbon emission per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated.\nThis is because most of the electricity in France is generated through nuclear power, while the United States still gets a significant percentage of electricity supplied through coal and natural gas. Likewise, there could be significant differences within a country such as the United States, with states like California having a higher mix of renewables compared to some other states.\nDriving Innovation in Semiconductor Technology\nA truly resilient grid strategy must start with expanded capacity for nuclear, wind, solar, and traditional forms of energy, while driving a mix shift to cleaner sources over time. However, to achieve this enhanced capacity, it will be necessary to invest in disruptive innovations. Transmission infrastructure must be modernized, including upgraded lines, substations and control systems. Likewise, the industry must take advantage of smart distribution technologies, deploying digital sensors and AI-driven load management techniques.\nSemiconductors have an important role to play. Continued growth of GPUs and other accelerators will drive corresponding growth in datacenter power semiconductors, along with increasing semiconductor content in other components such as the motherboard and the power supply.\nWe forecast that the datacenter power semiconductor market could reach $9 billion by 2030, driven by an increase in servers as well as the number of accelerators per server. Approximately $7 billion of the opportunity is driven by accelerators, with the rest coming from the power supply and other areas. As the technology matures, we believe gallium nitride will play an important role in this market, given its high efficiency.\nAs the grid incorporates increasing levels of renewables, more semiconductors will be needed for energy generation. Silicon carbide will be important for solar generation and potentially wind as well. We estimate that renewable energy generation could grow to more than a $20 billion market for semiconductors by 2030. A similar opportunity exists for smart infrastructure such as meters, sensors and heat pumps.\nShifting Incentives for Sustainable Growth\nRestructuring the power grid offers the single biggest opportunity to deliver sustainable, abundant energy for AI. Modernizing the power grid will require complex industry partnerships and buy-in from company leadership. In the past, sustainability initiatives were largely regarded as a compliance checkbox item, with unclear ties to business results. A new playbook is needed to enable the growth of AI while shifting business incentives toward generation, transmission, distribution and storage of clean energy and modernization of the power grid.\nTo truly harness the transformative productivity and prosperity potential of AI, we need a comprehensive sustainability strategy that expands clean energy capacity, modernizes energy infrastructure, and maintains diverse energy generation sources to ensure stable, abundant power for continued technological innovation. When combined with progress in energy-efficient computing and abatement measures, this holistic approach can realistically accelerate the pursuit of sustainability while mitigating the risk of curtailing growth due to insufficient energy resources.\nWe list the best IT infrastructure management service.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Rethinking power: how AI is reshaping energy demands in data centers\nAI\u2019s growth could challenge power demand and grid reliability\nToday, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing virtually every industry, but its rapid adoption also comes with a significant challenge: energy consumption.\nData centers are racing to accommodate the surge in AI-driven demand and are consuming significant amounts of electricity to support High-Performance Computing, cloud computing services, and the many digital products and services we rely on every day.\nWhy are we seeing such a spike in energy use? One reason is heavy reliance on graphics processing unit (GPU) chips, which are much faster and more effective than processing tasks. More than just an advantage, this efficiency has now made GPUs the new standard for training and running AI models and workloads.\nYet it also comes at a high cost: soaring energy consumption. Each GPU now requires up to four times more electricity than a standard CPU, an exponential increase that is quickly \u2013 and dramatically \u2013 changing demands for energy in the data center.\nHead of Sustainability, DataBank.\nFor example, consider these recent findings:\nThe New York Times recently described how OpenAI hopes to build five new data centers that would consume more electricity than the three million households in Massachusetts.\nAccording to the Center on Global Energy Policy, GPUs and their servers could make up as much as 27 percent of the planned new generation capacity for 2027 and 14 percent of total commercial energy needs that year.\nA Forbes article predicted that Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chipset will boost power consumption even further \u2013 a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.\nThese findings raise important power-related questions: Is AI growth outpacing the ability of utilities to supply the required energy? Are there other energy options data centers should consider? And maybe most importantly, what will data center\u2019s energy use look like in both the short- and long-term future?\nNavigating Power Supply and Demand in the AI Era\nDespite growing concerns, AI has not yet surpassed the grid\u2019s capabilities. In fact, some advancements suggest that AI energy consumption could even decreases. Many AI companies expended vast amounts of processing power to train their initial models, but newer players like DeepSeek now claim that their systems operate far more efficiently, requiring less computing power and energy.\nHowever, AI\u2019s sudden rise is only one factor in a perfect storm of energy demands. For example, the larger electrification movement, which has introduced millions of electric vehicles to the grid, and the reshoring of manufacturing to the U.S., is also straining resources. AI adds another layer to this complex equation, raising urgent questions about whether existing utilities can keep pace with demand.\nData centers, as commercial real estate, are also subject to the age-old adage, \u201clocation, location, location.\u201d Many power generation sites \u2013 especially those harnessing solar and wind \u2013 are located in rural places in the United States, but transmission bottlenecks make it difficult to move. That power to urban centers where demand is highest. Thus far, geodiversity and urban demand have not yet driven data centers to these remote areas.\nThis could soon change. Hyperscalers have already demonstrated their willingness and agility in building data centers in the Arctic Circle to take advantage of natural cooling to reduce energy use and costs. A similar shift may take hold in the U.S., with data center operators eyeing locations in New Mexico, rural Texas, Wyoming, and other rural markets to capitalize on similar benefits.\nExploring Alternative Energy Solutions\nAs strain on the grid intensifies, alternative energy solutions are gaining traction as a means of ensuring a stable and sustainable power supply.\nOne promising development is the evolution of battery technology. Aluminum-ion batteries, for example, offer several advantages over lithium-based alternatives. Aluminum is more abundant, sourced from conflict-free regions, and free from the geopolitical challenges associated with lithium and cobalt mining. These batteries also boast a solid-state design, reducing flammability risks, and their higher energy density enables more efficient storage, which helps smooth out fluctuations in energy supply and demand \u2013 often visualized as the daily \u201cduck curve.\u201d\nNuclear energy is also re-emerging as a viable solution for long-term, reliable power generation. Advanced small modular reactors (SMRs) offer a scalable, low-carbon alternative that can provide consistent energy without the intermittency of renewables.\nHowever, while test sites are under development, SMRs have yet to begin generating power and may still be five or more years away from large-scale deployment. Public perception remains a key challenge, as strict regulations often require plants to be situated far from populated areas, and the long-term management of nuclear waste continues to be a concern.\nAdditionally, virtual power plants (VPPs) are revolutionizing the energy landscape by connecting and coordinating thousands of decentralized batteries to function as a unified power source. By optimizing the generation, storage, and distribution of renewable energy, VPPs enhance grid stability and efficiency. Unlike traditional power plants, VPPs do not rely on a single energy source or location, making them inherently more flexible and resilient.\nSecuring a Sustainable Power Future for AI and Data Centers\nWhile it\u2019s hard to predict what lies ahead for AI and how much more demand we\u2019ll see, the pressure is on to secure reliable, sustainable power, now and into the future.\nAs the adoption of AI tools accelerates, data centers must proactively seek sustainable and resilient energy solutions. Embracing alternative power sources, modernizing grid infrastructure, and leveraging cutting-edge innovations will be critical in ensuring that the power needs of AI-driven industries can be met \u2013 now and in the years to come.\nWe list the best web hosting services.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "China has spent billions of dollars building far too many data centers for AI and compute - could it lead to a huge market crash?\n80% of the country's new data center capacity is unused, reports say\n- DeepSeek is just one of the many reasons China's AI growth simply didn't materialize\n- Up to 80% of new data center capacity hasn't been used according to local sources\n- Should this capacity hit the wider market, it could cause a major headache to data center developers\nChina\u2019s AI infrastructure boom is faltering, as according to a report in MIT Technology Review, the country built hundreds of data centers to support its AI ambitions, but many are now sitting unused.\nBillions were invested by both state and private entities in 2023 and 2024, with the expectation that demand for GPU rentals would keep growing, but uptake has in fact dropped off, and as a result many operators are now struggling to survive.\nMuch of the early momentum was driven by hype. The government, keen for China to become a global leader in AI, encouraged local officials to fast-track data center construction with the result that more than 500 projects were announced nationwide, and at least 150 were completed by the end of 2024, according to state-affiliated sources. However, MIT Technology Review says local publications are reporting that up to 80% of this new computing capacity remains idle.\nSelling off GPUs\nLocation is also a problem, MIT Technology Review notes. Facilities built in central and western China, where electricity is cheap, now face issues meeting latency requirements. In cities like Zhengzhou, operators are reportedly even giving away free compute vouchers in an attempt to lure users.\nIn some regions, developers began selling off GPUs after failing to secure long-term clients.\nXiao Li, a data center project manager who spoke with MIT Technology Review, said many WeChat groups that once boasted about Nvidia chip deals have gone quiet. \u201cIt seems like everyone is selling, but few are buying,\u201d he noted.\nShould this capacity hit the wider market, it could cause a major headache to data center developers, flooding an already soft sector with even more supply and pushing prices down further.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOne reason for the drop in demand is the rise of DeepSeek, which upended the global tech economy when it launched in January 2025.\nIts open source reasoning model, R1, matches the performance of ChatGPT o1 but at a lower cost, shifting interest away from model training and toward inference - the real-time use of AI models, which requires different infrastructure.\nMany of the data centers built during the rush were designed for large-scale training, not the low-latency demands of real-time reasoning.\nDespite the oversupply, the Chinese government reportedly remains committed. Central authorities held an AI symposium in early 2025, and firms like Alibaba and TikTok owner ByteDance have announced major investments.\nFor many early data center investors however, expectations have collapsed. The infrastructure was built, but the demand it was meant to supply simply hasn\u2019t arrived.\nYou might also like\nWayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

We also regularly cross-reference our findings with third-party testing labs such as AV-Comparatives and AV-TEST.\nIn my ranking of antivirus software, I found that Bitdefender was the best choice for most people thanks to its excellent scores in both our own professional testing, and in the lab results.

He has a passion for security products that keep people safe, and the knowledge to help them make the right decision.\nAugust 2025 Update - The rankings have remained unchanged this update, but I have checked the pricing, deals, and features of each antivirus software.

Its real-time protection is even enabled from the get-go.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You want quick scans: initial and deep scans take almost an hour to complete (five times longer than other antivirus on average). Thankfully, you'll still be able to work, play, and browse when they're running.\n\u274c You need identity theft monitoring: Bitdefender has some monitoring tools to track online identities, but for real round-the-clock protection from identity theft, you'll want to check out Norton.\n\u274c You're already infected with malware: Bitdefender isn't as effective when it comes to removing threats already attacking your system. For current infections, try Malwarebytes.\nOur thoughts:\nBitdefender is more than just antivirus software - it can be a life security suite depending on the plan you choose. It consistently impresses with its ability to identify threats and stop them in their tracks and has scored very highly in our own testing and testing done by third-party laboratories.\nBitdefender Total Security includes parental controls, a VPN, vulnerability scanner, and a dedicated browser. The software is remarkably easy to use and runs on most major operating systems. Most of the features will come enabled by default making it a hassle free installation process - just click and go.\n\u25b6 Try Bitdefender Total Security free for 30 days\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\n\ud83d\udd12 Bitdefender is the best antivirus package on the market\u2014and has been for a few years. It combines watertight security tools with straightforward apps and, best of all, offers fantastic value for money.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Consistently earns high marks from third-party security test labs | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Won't impact your speed or create noticeable slowdown | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Most key features are automatically enabled and apps are intuitive | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Safe banking features, webcam monitoring, and parental controls to name a few | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Bitdefender lacks live support but has a library of video tutorials, how-to articles, and a helpful community | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | There are cheaper solutions out there, but you're getting a lot of functionality and value with Bitdefender | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Bitdefender review here.\nBest for families\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You need identity theft protection: the LifeLock feature monitors the dark web and stolen data banks, and will let you know if it finds any of your details in the wild.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want multi-device protection: keep your mobile phones and tablets secure with sleek apps that include Wi-Fi security.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need to secure your browser: Norton hides your VPN, and your browsing history, so you can surf the web without leaving an identifiable trail.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You're on a budget: Norton is hardly a budget option\u2014even with its new-user deals\u2014and only gets pricier on renewal.\n\u274c You need backup: the cheapest plans come with 2 Gb of space, which isn't all that generous.\n\u274c You want a stellar VPN: while solid, Norton Secure VPN doesn't top our best VPN list.\nOur thoughts:\nNorton is a household name in the antivirus industry with very strong testing results. In our testing it detected all our sample files, and has consistent high sores across independent testing labs.\nNorton 360 with Lifelock goes beyond Norton's award winning malware protection and includes comprehensive identity theft protection - complete with insurance, credit monitoring, and identity & SSN alerts. If you are looking for family protection, you can protect up to 10 devices, store precious memories in the generous cloud backup, and use parental controls to ensure your children are safe online.\n\u25b6 Try Norton 360 with LifeLock and get a 60-day money-back guarantee\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 Norton excels when it comes to basic malware protection and offers some awesome advanced tools\u2014like its LifeLock identity theft monitoring service. These extras make it an expensive option, however.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Excellent at detecting known malware, malicious URLs, and threats to your identity | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Slight lag when running, placing it right in the middle of the pack | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Its dual dashboards can be tricky to navigate | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | An impressive tool set, including a solid VPN, password manager, and cloud backup | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | No problems reaching out to Norton via email, live chat, and even telephone | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | An undeniabley pricey product, but a plethora of tools ensure you're getting your money's worth | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Norton review here.\nBest for mobile\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f Mobile security is your priority: McAfee's mobile apps provide all-around protection that you can take on the go.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want to protect your identity: check out a raft of tools and advanced features designed to safeguard against identity theft and phishing.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need good network protection: keep hackers out of your home network system with an intelligent firewall for all of your devices.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You're on a budget: McAfee is a big name with a big price tag, and particularly pricey on renewal.\n\u274c You use a Mac: although it does run on Mac computers, the solution still feels a little clunky compared to its Windows version.\n\u274c You want built-in parental controls: you'll need to pay extra to access parental controls, adding extra cost to a solution that's already pretty expensive.\nOur thoughts:\nMcAfee is another name that frequently tops the tests in our own trials and third-party testing. McAfee has a solid reputation for antivirus protection, and consistently scores top marks.\nMcAfee+ goes beyond simple antivirus protection and includes a firewall, password manager, file shredder and unlimited VPN all in just the basic tier. The mobile apps are well crafted and easy to use, making it a top choice for those who want protection on the go. You can also use the Online Account Cleanup tool to check if any of your online accounts are having their data hoovered up by less than reputable sites, and help you delete them.\n\u25b6 Try McAfee+ with its 30 day money back guarantee\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\n\ud83d\udd12 McAfee is undoubtedly expensive, but earns its spot in my top picks with standout mobile apps, advanced features, and its prioritization of identity protection.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Excellent protection and plenty of extra tools to help keep you secure | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Infrequent lagging, but not enough to interrupt what you're working on | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Mobile apps are pretty straightforward to use, desktop is a bit overwhelming when you first use it | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Many tools focus on protecting your identity including a VPN and personal data cleanup, but how well they work depends on what you're willing to pay | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Decent FAQs section on its website, and a support community, live chat is with a Virtual Assistant and not a live agent | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | One of the most expensive antivirus programs, but you can use it on any number of devices | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full McAfee review here.\nBest for Wi-Fi security\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You have a lot of smart devices: F-Secure has one of the best network protection tools to secure every gadget connected to your home internet.\n\u2714\ufe0f You value speed: scans balance speed with thoroughness without sacrificing either.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need a VPN: the F-Secure VPN does have its limitations, but it's a useful tool to have in a pinch.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You're new to antivirus: the dashboard is very text-heavy, which can be overwhelming, and it's not the easiest tool to install.\n\u274c You need Chromebook protection: unfortunately, F-Secure doesn't offer a Chromebook app\u2014meaning you'll have to look elsewhere.\n\u274c You don't want to be slowed down: you might experience slower load times when opening programs or browsing the web, leading to serious frustration.\nOur thoughts:\nI frequently write about smart devices being taken over by hackers, so F-Secure is a sight for sore eyes in this respect. While F-Secure doesn't quite rival the scores of other antivirus in testing - and occasionally throws up a few false alarms - it provides great protection for edge, IoT, and smart devices connected to your Wi-Fi network.\nOne of the standout features of F-Secure Total is the 24/7 live and remote support that can help you with any bugs or glitches you might experience - something very few providers offer. The network protection can even protect your on unsecured public networks while the built-in VPN keeps your traffic encrypted and private.\n\u25b6 Try F-Secure Total for 30 days free\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 F-secure takes some getting used to, but all of the most important security and privacy tools are there\u2014including incredible network protection and 24/7 live support.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Excellent malware blocking and protects smart devices connected to your home network | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Some slowdown when launching programs or navigating the web | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Not the easiest to figure out, but the tutorials do help | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Not as many tools as other antivirus software, but the ones included are helpful | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Live support is available including remote support for difficult issues | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | First-time users get a great bargain, but the price jumps higher on renewal | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full F-Secure review here.\nBest for ad blocking\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a reliable ad-blocker: Avira includes a handy ad blocker to keep your browsing fast and hassle free.\n\u2714\ufe0f You'd like to try before buying: Avira's free plan is limited, but gives you a good taste of what to expect if you choose to upgrade.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want configurability: Avira gives users plenty of ways to tailor their security experience.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You use a lot of locally saved apps: during my testing, I found that Avira causes apps to launch more slowly.\n\u274c You need mobile protection: most of Avira's packages aren't available for mobile devices\u2014and those that are have a hefty price tag.\n\u274c You want optimal PC performance: Avira has a tendency to take a bit out of your device performance.\nOur thoughts:\nAvira performs really well in testing, being able to detect our own bespoke EICAR files and performing well against existing and new threats in tests done by third parties.\nA standout point is the included ad blocker which significantly improves web page load times and general user experience. Avira Internet Security also includes a handy bargain hunting tool to help you get the best deals when shopping online. While it does include a system optimizer tool and PUA shield to reduce PC slowdown, it does tend to take up a few more resources than we would like - but overall it is a solid antivirus solution.\n\u25b6 Try Avira antivirus for free\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 Avira has a lot of handy tools that can be configured down to the last detail and a free plan you can use to try before you buy\u2014however, it's not the best pick for mobile devices.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | No problem stopping both known and new malware threats | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Slower at loading webpages and downloading software | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Dark mode interface that is intuitively laid out, but most tools, including ransomware protections, have to be turned on | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Includes some good advanced security tools, but not enough to be compared with other \"internet security\" suites | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Some basic help articles are online, the only way to contact a live agent is through the email form | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | Decent price point and has a monthly subscription available | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Avira review here.\nBest for gamers\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You want the best malware protection: Avast came out on top in all of our malware-blocking tests.\n\u2714\ufe0f Gaming is your priority: block untrustworthy incoming connections with a handy gaming mode\u2014which is enabled by default.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want to try before buying: Avast's free plan has its limitations, but effectively showcases the product's capabilities.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You don't want to delete unwanted apps: Avast will do its very best to install its own internet browser and make it your new default, which is slightly frustrating.\n\u274c You need better VPN access: depending on your plan, you might experience bandwidth caps and a limited choice of servers\n\u274c You need clear warnings: at times, unwarranted warnings can pop up with no clear way to stop them\nOur thoughts:\nAvast is one of the best performing antivirus software providers, scoring top marks in our testing and achieving impressive results in testing performed by the third party pros.\nAvast One is designed to be a simple all-in-one app that does everything it says on the tin, and if you want it to do more, it can. The app automatically goes into gaming mode so that you can squeeze all the performance you need out of your device without your security taking a hit. Avast One comes with more features than I can list, but some notable inclusion are dark web monitoring, scam detection, and an advanced firewall to keep hackers out of your network.\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 Avast One is a malware-blocking powerhouse that stops threats dead in their tracks. It won't slow your device to a crawl, either, and is incredibly easy to use\u2014a great pick for antivirus first-timers.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Top scores for malware protection from third-party test labs | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Doesn't create noticeable lag, and has an awesome gamer mode | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Friendly apps for all devices with a fresh design, and they're easy to use | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Paid users get the lion's share of features and access to an unlimited VPN | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | No live chat, but you can typically get a response from support staff via email within 24 hours | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | Subscriptions won't break the bank and come with a plethora of features, and the free plan is equally impressive | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Avast review here.\nBest for malware removal\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You have an existing malware infection: when it comes to getting rid of threats that are already on your computer, Malwarebytes is unbeatable.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want to see real-time security reports: check out what the antivirus is doing, at any time, with detailed insights.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want multi-device protection: protect between two and 10 devices without spending a fortune.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You need flawless detection: Malwarebytes can struggle to pinpoint, and resolve, new threats.\n\u274c You want to protect more than Windows devices: while the solution is compatible with other operating systems, it's also more limited.\nOur thoughts:\nMalwarebytes has always been my choice when it comes to getting rid of a malware infection, but wouldn't be my go-to when it comes to real-time protection. In our own testing (and independent testing), it scored in the middle ground of what I would expect.\nBut, as I said, if you currently have malware lurking on your device then Malwarebytes is a solid tool for getting rid of it - and what Malwarebytes lacks in testing scores, it makes up for in features. The software will provide real time protection reports, scam protection, and even includes AI-powered protection. Some features are only available on the Windows app however.\n\u25b6 Get Malwarebytes free edition\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\n\ud83d\udd12 Malwarebytes excels at removing malware already on your device, but can fall short in real-time protection.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Not as effective at blocking malware as it is at removing current infections | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Fairly light on resources, so not a problem to run it in the background | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Basic use is easy to figure out, but it gets harder when you need to customize settings | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Doesn't have the level of advanced features we'd expect in a Pro program | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | All support links redirect you to its extensive knowledgebase rather than provide live support options right away | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | Monthly subscription prices are about right for what is offered | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Malwarebytes review here.\nBest for Mac\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You're a Mac user: Intego is designed specifically for Mac machines.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need parental controls: you won't find many other antivirus solutions for Mac that include configurable parental controls.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want to boost your Mac performance: Intego's Mac Washing Machine can spot vulnerable software and old apps and help clear them up.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You need mobile protection: unfortunately, this antivirus offering is only available for desktops.\n\u274c You're looking for powerful extras: Intego doesn't have the quantity, or quality, of advanced features as our other picks.\n\u274c You have a mixed device household: households with a mix of different operating systems won't all benefit from the same plan.\nOur thoughts:\nIntego scores well in testing across the board and is specially built to be friendly to Mac machines. In fact, it offers a Mac Washing Machine tool to keep your device free of vulnerable and outdated applications that could be a potential virus entry point.\nOutside of scoring though, there is a bit of a downside. Each of the five security applications included in the Intego Mac Premium Bundle X9 has to be installed individually, and while this is great for those looking to pick and choose what parts they use, many of the other providers have a single app that includes all the various protection tools. If you don't mind taking the time to install them, Intego makes an excellent Mac protection antivirus.\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\n\ud83d\udd12 Intego is a great pick for Mac machines, and can clean up your system to keep it running efficiently.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Misses a few threats, but does score higher than average for malware detection | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | We noticed a bit of lag with the app itself, but it didn't seem to affect our working and browsing too much | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Each tool is a separate download with its own dashboard making it harder to navigate the entire package | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | A bit limited, but the system cleaner and parental controls are effective | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Lots of pages to navigate through the find the support email form, live chat is sometimes available | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | It's expensive, other Mac antivirus is available for cheaper and with more tools | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Intego review here.\nBest for banking\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You bank or shop online: PayGuard, Trend Micro's secure banking feature, is one of the best in the industry.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want web protection: Trend Micro has a robust URL blocker that will warn you if you stumble across a dangerous site.\n\u2714\ufe0f You don't want too many bells and whistles: Trend Micro offers a simple antivirus software without any overwhelming tools and options.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You're an avid gamer: Trend Micro has a noticeable impact on device performance, and can interrupt gameplay (and streaming.)\n\u274c You want to customize your experience: if you're looking for an antivirus solution you can customize, you're better off with Bitdefender.\n\u274c You are looking for more than just antivirus: Trend Micro lacks the extra features to protect more than just your device.\nOur thoughts:\nTrend Micro sits in the middle ground in terms of antivirus protection, both in our own testing and testing done by the independent labs, but is near-unrivaled when it comes to banking protection.\nTrend Micro Antivirus+ Security offers a tool known as PayGuard, which helps keeps payments made through your browser secure and out of the clutches of any hackers that could be lurking online. Trend Micro does unfortunately hamper device performance and doesn't offer as many extra security features as its rivals - which could be a good thing for those looking for a simple and easy to use solution.\n\u25b6 Try Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security for 30 days risk-free\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 Trend Micro doesn't come with a ton of added features, but if you need a boost of security for your banking and online shopping, Pay Guard is a fantastic option.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Struggles a bit to stop brand new threats not included in malware databases | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Causes some slowdown when downloading programs or launching an application | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Very simple interface with essential security tools you need already turned on | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Not a lot is included with its basic subscription, but Pay Guard comes with all antivirus subscriptions | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Phone, email, and chat support are all available, but there may be some delays when trying to connect | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | Not too bad for basic protection of a single Windows device | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Trend Micro review here.\nBest for customization\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an antivirus you can configure: plenty of low-level configurability gives you granular control over setup and features.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need multi-device support: with ESET, you can choose how many devices to include in your subscription.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want to protect multiple network devices: everything that you connect to your Wi-Fi network is protected, including IoT and smart devices.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You need a wide array of tools: ESET isn't as feature-rich as its closest competitors, though its advanced tools are still solid.\n\u274c You want iOS support: if you want to secure your iPhone or iPad, I'd recommend checking out Bitdefender's mobile apps.\n\u274c You want zero-day malware protection: ESET reserves its top level of protection for the more expensive subscriptions.\nOur thoughts:\nIn terms of protection, ESET antivirus software sits in the big leagues with the likes of Avast and Bitdefender - but this level of protection comes at a cost, even without all the extras.\nThe ESET Essential plan is exactly that, just the essentials. You get antivirus protection for one device, plus a firewall, banking protection, and a network shield to protect internet connected devices. So if you're looking for a feature-rich package, you will have to opt for the highest tier subscription. If you do, you can access an unlimited VPN, identity protection, and a password manager - but keep in mind many other brands provide these without breaking the bank.\n\u25b6 Try ESET Internet Security for 30 days free\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 ESET is easy to install, though a little more difficult to figure out once it's up and running. Plus, some important security features are reserved for its most expensive product.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Slightly below average of the industry average in some independent tests, doesn't include new threat detection in all programs | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Definitely can feel the lag when using this antivirus | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | The interface feels outdated with a lot of text that gives it an overwhelming, busy look | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Missing some important tools like a password manager and data encryption, but the number of security features is impressive | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Not the easiest to find answers to questions and even harder to figure out how to get a hold of a live person | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | An overall good deal, though we wish more was included | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full ESET review here.\nTechRadar's antivirus rankings\nThere are more antivirus solutions on the market than we can count\u2014but only ten spots in our list of favorites. Below, you can check out our rankings at a glance, including some honorable mentions that just missed out on a spot in our shortlist.\nProvider | Summary |\n|---|---|\n1. Bitdefender | Sets the standard for all antivirus to reach for |\n2. Norton | Good protection and great identity theft services |\n3. Avast | Easy to use, great advanced security, excellent gaming mode |\n4. McAfee | Good for mobile, and decent on other devices, too, but expensive |\n5. F-Secure | Protects smart devices, such as TVs and Amazon Echo connected to your network |\n6. Trend Micro | Good protections for banking and shopping online |\n7. AVIRA | Decent tools with a good free antivirus available |\n8. ESET | Okay for basic protection, but feels outdated and falls behind better options |\n9. Malwarebytes | Not the best as a first defender malware blocker, but is excellent at removing threats already on your device |\n10. Intego | Specifically designed for Mac computers, does well at blocking threats, but awkward to use |\nHow to choose antivirus software\nHow do you decide on just one antivirus solution when there are dozens of viable candidates out there? The obvious answer is to consult our rankings\u2014our shortlist is the result of pooled expert knowledge, in-house testing, third-party security labs testing, and thorough, continually updated reviews of the top antivirus players.\nPerhaps more importantly, however, you need to consider your own needs and use case. Do you have a ton of devices to protect? Do you need advanced features or specific tools? Do you want a service with a built-in VPN to save money on subscription fees?\nThese considerations will vary from person to person and might mean that our number one pick isn't your match made in heaven. Our recommendations can point you in the direction of some stellar options, but you'll need to modify these based on your individual requirements.\nFor more thoughts on this, check out our article exploring how to choose the best antivirus.\nHow we test antivirus software - our review methodology\nTo get a clear, accurate, and thorough picture of each antivirus, I take a multi-faceted approach to my testing\u2014and I make sure I get hands-on experience with each product.\nThanks to our team's background in IT, we're able to create malware files for specific use in testing environments. We keep these files on a short leash and let them wreak a little havoc\u2014nothing that we can't control, of course\u2014but this is an important part of the process, seeing as they're new threats that no antivirus software will be familiar with.\nLots of antivirus developers provide a test file called 'EICAR' that simulates a threat that isn't a threat. The problem with relying on this file during testing is that antivirus companies have made sure that their software recognizes it. Using our own bespoke malware helps us evaluate how well these services deal with the unknown.\nWe don't rely solely on our findings, however. There are all sorts of ways to test antivirus and some fantastic labs out there that do it a lot more frequently than we do. That's why we refer to results from AV-Comparatives and AV-Tests to paint a broader picture of the antivirus software's capabilities and assign a fair protection score.\nPerformance is a critical consideration during our testing. We need to know how much slowdown is caused by installing and running the antivirus, and how much it's going to impact your day-to-day activities. After all, an antivirus that zaps every threat known to man, but slows your machine down to a crawl, won't be much use to anyone.\nWe know that resources will be used, seeing as the antivirus programs are saved locally on the device, but we still measure things like how long it takes to open a browser, navigate to a website, attach a file to an email, or how long it takes a webpage to load fully.\nOnline speed test websites give us a hand with this process by providing the nit-picky numbers to supplement our real-time testing. That way, we can balance solid statistics with our individual experiences, to get a real feel for how the antivirus behaves outside of a lab.\nAs you'd expect, real-time testing involves us installing and using antivirus programs on our home devices. We'll keep track of anything out of the ordinary, the highs and lows, and how easy the software is to navigate. This is also where we'll dig into the tools and settings to see if they do everything that they're supposed to do\u2014think password managers, file encryption, VPN add-ons, and parental controls.\nCustomer support is another important aspect of any review. Usually, it's easy enough to follow along with the on-screen instructions provided by the installation wizard when you download new antivirus software, but that doesn't mean there aren't times when you'll need a little extra help from an agent.\nWe evaluate each company's support options, ranging from the live chat support and email ticketing systems, if available, and the online library of resources. We measure how quickly agents respond to our inquries, how detailed their reply is, and how accessible the company's resources are\u2014particularly for new users.\nTested by\nMike is a lead security reviewer at Future, where he stress-tests VPNs, antivirus and more to find out which services are sure to keep you safe, and which are best avoided.\nSead is a seasoned freelance journalist based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He covers all things cybersecurity, including ID theft, ransomware, and data breaches, as well as laws and regulations related to the field.\nThe best antivirus FAQs\nWhat is the best antivirus of 2025\nI put all of today's top dogs to the test and found that Bitdefender is the best antivirus software in 2025.\nIt's a superb bit of kit\u2014from its entry-level Bitdefender Antivirus Plus and its cast-iron malware defenses, excellent threat detection and genuinely value-adding extra features, right up to its all-singing, all-dancing Total Security that adds an array of maintenance tools and can be used to protect your family's computers, tablets and phones.\nWhat does antivirus do? How does virus protection work?\nAn antivirus app sits on your device like a guard dog, watching over the entire system and sniffing out suspicious intruders. In short, it offers real-time defenses against viruses or other threats, which, if detected, are immediately dealt with, preventing them from carrying out their destructive payload. As well as this automated protection, you can run manual virus scans whenever you wish.\nAntivirus applications use what are called virus \u2018definitions\u2019 to catch intruders. Think of these as the fingerprints of malware, and if something is spotted coming onto your system that has a matching fingerprint, the antivirus leaps into action, quarantining the offender. As another line of defense, antivirus programs also use what are called \u2018heuristics\u2019 that look for any file or process exhibiting suspicious behavior\u2014this allows the app to potentially catch any freshly made malware that isn\u2019t yet in its definitions database.\nFor more details on this topic, see our full breakdown of exactly how antivirus software works.\nDo I really need antivirus in 2025?\nThe internet is jam-packed with threats, like ransomware, cooked up by cybercriminals willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want. Security breaches are commonplace, unfortunately, and hackers use malware to crack a company's system and make off with important files\u2014including customer information. Unfortunately, that means that you're the ultimate victim of these attacks, seeing as they can lead to identity theft.\nToday's best antivirus programs can help prevent identity theft by keeping an eye on the dark web, where all sorts of personal information is bought and sold. You'll also get protection against phishing scams, and block messages designed to trick you into handing over personal information to dodgy third parties.\nMore and more antivirus software includes a VPN, too, which will safeguard your browsing sessions regardless of the device you're using. You'll be able to bypass geo-restrictions and blocks, and avoid cookies, trackers, and invasive ads.\nYou may have heard arguments that if you\u2019re prudent about where you browse on the web, and what you download or click on, you\u2019ll be fine\u2014and that\u2019s true to a certain extent, but I really wouldn\u2019t risk it. Even well-known websites might occasionally be victims of malware being peddled via their adverts (in other words, the ad networks they work with), for example, so no matter how cautious and tech-savvy you are, it\u2019s worth having an antivirus app as a fall-back defense.\nFortunately, the best antivirus products are getting more and more affordable\u2014and free antivirus keeps improving, too.\nIs free antivirus enough?\nUnfortunately, there's not a simple yes or no answer to this question.\nA good free antivirus can boost your digital security, and a lot of folks will rely on Microsoft Defender to do the job. The good news is that Microsoft Defender is a decent option that'll cover all of the basics when it comes to putting a stop to viruses and malware.\nYou'll find that most free antivirus use the same protection engine (the central tech that monitors your device and thwarts threats) as their paid counterparts.\nHowever, premium antivirus programs offer extra features above and beyond the fundamentals. A robust system of parental controls could be a huge win for those with kids, for example. Or, a dedicated anti-ransomware layer of protection that only comes with the paid-for product could help catch one of the most dreaded infections and halt it in its tracks.\nGiven how cheap some premium antivirus apps are\u2014particularly with the various deals on offer\u2014it\u2019s well worth considering going this route instead to get extra features that could give you more peace of mind.\nFor more on this, read our full piece on whether free antivirus is enough to protect you.\nEditors' note: Kaspersky Anti-Virus used to appear on this list. However, considering the current climate, and the recent ban of the sale of Kaspersky software in the US, we've made the decision to remove the provider.\nAlthough much of the company's core processes now take place in Switzerland, the fact that its headquarters remain in Moscow, and that there are prior allegations around government coercion, it feels prudent to urge caution when considering the provider.\nWhat's more, with so many excellent alternatives to choose from, it's impossible to wholeheartedly recommend Kaspersky at this time.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBenedict has been writing about security issues for over 7 years, first focusing on geopolitics and international relations while at the University of Buckingham.

Chat GPT\n- What is it: A fast, multimodal AI assistant from OpenAI that can understand and respond using text, images, audio, and even video.\n- Ideal for: Anyone who needs a flexible AI to help with writing, research, coding, image generation, file analysis, or even live conversations.\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT for everything from writing blog drafts to debugging code and summarizing PDFs, and honestly, it\u2019s only getting better. The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory). Team and Enterprise plans unlock more tools for collaborative and business use.\nBest All-in-One AI Assistant for Everyday Use\nChatGPT has matured from a simple text generator into a full-featured multimodal assistant that handles everything from writing and brainstorming to coding, file analysis, and visuals. With its consistent rollout of features and intuitive UI, it remains one of the most accessible tools in the AI space. Try GPT-4o for free or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month to unlock more tools, memory, and better performance.\n2. Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner. Built with native integration across Google Workspace and powered by the Gemini 2.5 model, it\u2019s designed to reduce busywork and surface insights across your files and tools. From summarizing documents to organizing your day, Gemini blends into your existing routines without extra setup. Enroll for Gemini Advanced absolutely free for the first month.\n3. Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builders that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is an all-in-one website hosting and building platform. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute. Its AI builder creates a ready-to-edit layout from just one sentence, while extras like an AI writer, SEO assistant, and image generator help you fill out your content. It\u2019s fast, beginner-friendly, and comes bundled with hosting, email, and eCommerce tools. Grab a 75% discount on Hostinger\u2019s Premium Website Builder plan on a four-year term at just $2.99/mo.\n3. GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point. GoDaddy also provides 24/7 support with an AI help assistant, which makes it super easy to get answers on the fly.\nBest AI Website Builder for Small Business and E-commerce Launches\nGoDaddy\u2019s AI Website Builder is both easy to use and powerful enough. Built-in features cover everything from appointment booking and email marketing to social posts and eCommerce setup. It\u2019s especially helpful if you want to launch quickly and keep everything under one roof. You can get started with the Basic Website Building plan at just $9.99/ month (41% discount) if you opt for the yearly package.\nBest AI virtual assistants\n1. Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help. Whether you\u2019re scheduling a meeting, sending a quick message, or just asking how to screen record, Siri blends seamlessly into your routine. It\u2019s available for free on all supported Apple devices running iOS 18 and above.\n2. Google Assistant\n- What is it: Google\u2019s longtime voice-powered assistant for Android and smart devices, now transitioning to Gemini for more advanced, AI-driven help.\n- Ideal for: Android users who want voice-based assistance for everyday tasks, real-time answers, and device-wide control.\nGoogle Assistant works across phones, tablets, smart speakers, and even in-car systems, so it\u2019s always within reach when you need it.\nWhether you\u2019re in the kitchen, driving, or just relaxing on the couch, you can use it to get things done without picking up your device.\nDuring testing, I asked it to check the weather, play music on a speaker, and add smoothie ingredients to my list. Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading. It brings more intelligence, flexibility, and awareness to your phone, home, and even your car.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Everyday Google Tasks\nGoogle Assistant still helps you manage your day with hands-free commands across Android phones, smart speakers, and other connected devices. It works directly with Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and smart home tools, making it easy to check reminders, get directions, or control your lights with just your voice. It continues to run reliably on millions of devices worldwide and remains free to use on Android phones and Google smart devices through 2025.\n3. Amazon Alexa\n- What is it: Amazon\u2019s voice assistant built into Echo devices and now evolving into Alexa Plus, a more conversational AI powered by generative technology.\n- Ideal for: Smart home users and Amazon shoppers who want hands-free control, productivity features, and built-in entertainment across devices.\nAlexa has grown from being a voice-controlled speaker into a full-fledged home assistant, and with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI, Alexa remembers more, responds with more personality, and handles tasks independently across apps and services.\nOn my Echo device, Alexa handles my reminders, helps me control smart lights with voice prompts, plays music, and even gives delivery updates without a hitch. With Alexa+, it feels more like talking to someone than giving commands.\nNow, it can pick up on incomplete questions, remember preferences like dietary needs, and even follow through on multi-step tasks, like finding a plumber and booking a visit.\n\u2705 You use Alexa for your smart home devices: Alexa+ improves everything from device control to alerts and media playback.\n\u2705 You\u2019re already a Prime member: Alexa+ is free for Prime users and available across Echo devices and mobile apps.\n\u274c You need AI for work or productivity workflows: Alexa+ is still more home- and lifestyle-focused than business-oriented.\nSmart home control feels smoother now. I could move music or video across devices and get Ring alerts when a package arrived, all without picking up my phone.\nYou can upload photos, event flyers, or even study material, and Alexa+ can summarize them or turn them into To-Dos or flashcards. It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests. It remembers your preferences and acts across apps and devices without additional prompts. It\u2019s built into Echo speakers and displays, with proactive alerts, personalized routines, and smart home control that works even across rooms. It comes included for free with Amazon Prime, or is available for $19.99/month excl. Early access rolling out to Echo Show users in the U.S.\nBest AI voice generators\n1. Murf.ai\nMurfai.ai is by far one of the most popular AI voice generators. Their AI-powered voice technology can create realistic voices that sound like real humans, with intonation, pronunciation, and emotions that are similar to those of a human speaker.\nUsers can generate voices in a wide range of languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, and more. They also offer different accents for each language, allowing users to select the one that suits their projects.\nCustomization features include adjusting the voice speed, pitch, and volume to suit your specific needs, and the option to choose between male and female voices, which can add more versatility to your projects.\nLike most of its alternatives, Murf.ai offers a pay-per-use model, which means that you only pay for the number of characters you need to convert to speech. You also get a free trial with 5,000 characters, to get you started with the software and allow you to test the service before committing to a plan. Murf.ai starts at $29/month or $19/ month if billed yearly.\n2. Play.ht\nPlay.ht is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that allows users to convert written text into realistic-sounding audio. The software offers a range of options for users, including male voices, female voices, and multiple languages.\nOne of the main advantages of Play.ht is its ease of use. All you need to do is simply copy and paste your written text into the platform, select the voice and the language you want, and the tool will generate your desired audio for you. You also get a variety of customization options, such as the ability to adjust the speed and pitch of the voice.\nAnother benefit of Play.ht is its range of pricing plans to suit different needs and budgets, hosting a variety of premium plans and payment options. They offer pay-as-you-go options as well as monthly subscriptions. Additionally, Play.ht offers a free plan with a 5,000-word limit. Premium plans start at $39.25/ month or $29.25/ month billed yearly\nHowever, note that the service may not be suitable for users who require highly specialized voices. If you need strong regional accents or unique speech patterns this might not be your suitable option.\nWhile the voices are generally of high quality, they may sound robotic and unnatural sometimes, especially when speaking longer pieces of text.\nPlay.ht is useful, efficient, and cost-effective for users who need to convert text to audio fast and easily, but it may not be the best choice for all users. It all comes down to your specific needs and requirements.\n3. Lovo.ai\nLovo.ai is a text-to-speech (TTS) software that provides AI-generated voices in multiple languages and accents. It uses advanced deep-learning technology to produce natural-sounding voices with expressiveness and emotion. You can use it to create custom voiceovers for a variety of applications, including podcasts, e-learning courses, videos, and virtual assistants.\nWith the range of customization options provided, users can adjust the tone, speed, and emphasis of the generated voice to suit their needs.\nLovo.ai's voice generator has received numerous positive reviews from real-time users and industry experts for its quality and versatility.

ElevenLabs\nEleven Labs offers solid features to transform text into natural-sounding speech and to clone voices with great accuracy. It offers a level of realism that sets it apart from other similar tools. While getting started, you can train the AI with just a few voice samples to create personalized voices for a variety of purposes. Plus, you can even earn every time someone uses your voice on their project.\nIt excels with its Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature and offers four distinct AI speech models: Eleven Turbo v2 for low latency, Eleven English v1 with plenty of voices and styles, Eleven Multilingual v1 which supports 10 languages, and Eleven Multilingual v2 supporting 29 languages. Plus, you can choose from over 40 pre-made voices or create your own custom voices. It further helps in fine-tuning of stability, clarity, and style exaggeration simply by generation speed and output quality for optimal results.\nEleven Labs offers two levels of voice cloning. Instant Voice Cloning needs just a few minutes of audio to create a high-quality clone quickly. Whereas, Professional Voice Cloning, requires at least 30 minutes of audio to produce an identical replica of the original voice. This advanced cloning supports all available languages and accents, which makes it perfect for professional-grade applications\nNonetheless, ElevenLabs comes with a few shortcomings as well. First, the software's fancy features might be tricky for beginners. This could be a problem for new teams who want to finish their work quickly. Alongside, their pricing structure is based on usage which makes it pretty expensive for heavy usage.\nFor instance, ElevenLabs AI has 4 premium plans i.e. Starter, Creator, Independent Publisher, and Growing Business. Under this, the cheapest plan starts at $5/mo and includes basic features and a 30,000-character output capacity whereas, the most expensive plan costs $330//mo and offers 2,000,000 character output and 660 custom voice slots . This could prove expensive for you if you want extensive voice synthesis and have a tight budget.\n2. Speechify\nSpeechify also coverts text to speech, with an extensive library of over 200 unique voices that include various genders, accents, and speaking styles. With Speechify, you can fine-tune specific elements on a word-by-word basis and make precise adjustments to pitch, speed, and tone.\nIt offers a video dubbing tool that automatically translates and dubs audio for videos from YouTube or uploaded files. This tool synchronizes the generated audio with the video\u2019s speaker movements and delivers a very natural viewing experience. Additionally, Speechify supports different use cases, like helping individuals with reading difficulties, promoting accessibility for the visually impaired, and aiding language learning by providing audio versions of texts.\nIt also includes AI avatars that sync with voiceovers and make your presentations and sales decks more engaging. These avatars can be customized for tone and emotion, which improves their lifelike appearance. Similarly, Speechify\u2019s neat user interface and drag-and-drop functionality make editing straightforward and creating content very smooth.\nMoreover, Speechify also comes with cross-platform compatibility through which it works seamlessly on smartphones, tablets, computers, and makes it accessible for you across different devices. It also integrates well with many platforms like Notion, WordPress, and HubSpot.\n3. HitPaw\nHitPaw Voice Changer is a real-time AI voice changing tool, ideal for gamers, content creators, Vtubers, and live streamers. With over 100 voice-changing effects, it can transform your voice into various characters and celebrities seamlessly.

This feature, combined with customizable shortcut keys for easy access to favorite sound effects, further improves Hitpaw\u2019s usability for both beginners and professionals.\nOverall, HitPaw\u2019s Voice Changer is a handy choice for video creators who are already using its video editing software and want to spice up their content with voice-changing features. Still, if you're more focused on having advanced voice customization or a wider variety of AI voices, then you might want to consider using a dedicated AI voice changer instead.\nBest AI translators\n1. Google Translate\nGoogle Translate is one of the most used translation tools on the internet. It offers multilingual support for text, voice, and images. It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2. Microsoft translator\nGiving cut-throat competition to Google, Microsoft also has a translation service of its own.

      "text": "AI is guzzling energy. Scientists estimate North American data centers' power requirements increased nearly 100% from 2022 to 2023, largely driven by generative AI (GenAI). By 2026, they anticipate data centers to become the fifth largest electricity consumers in the world, exceeding the usage of most countries.\nHowever, speculation about AI's detrimental effects on the environment might be overblown. For many corporations, particularly those that produce or sell physical goods, AI technology makes up only a small portion of their overall emissions. Oversimplifying AI as \u201ccarbon-intensive\u201d diverts attention from its impactful sustainability opportunities. When used wisely, AI has the potential to offset its own footprint and actively contribute to a greener future.\nCEO of Optera.\nWhat is AI's emissions trajectory?\nAI's carbon output is primarily measured through data center energy consumption. These algorithms, especially GenAI, require significant computational power for training and operation. As usage grows, so does the electricity drain.\nThese impacts are significant. However, the belief that AI will remain an exponential data hog ignores the rapid pace of innovation in model design, hardware, deployment and the transition to renewable energy.\nToday's algorithms are likely the most inefficient they will ever be. Techniques like model distillation are becoming more prevalent, creating smaller, more energy-conscious models, and manufacturers are designing more energy-efficient AI chips.\nAdditionally, the energy grid is getting greener, translating to fewer emissions from data centers. Consider these factors: According to the World Resources Institute, renewables outpaced other energy generation sources, accounting for 90% of the United States' new installed capacity in 2024.\nThe International Renewable Energy Agency states that more than 80% of renewable capacity additions produce cheaper electricity than fossil fuel alternatives.\nBloombergNEF reported that more than 40% of the world's electricity came from zero-carbon sources in 2023. Major companies, including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, are investing in clean energy to power their growing data centers.\nExperts predict that economics alone could drive renewables to account for 50% of electricity by the end of the decade. Meaningful government policies could accelerate that transition. This momentum makes me optimistic that we can mitigate the environmental impacts of AI use.\nAI emissions also attract significant attention because they are easy to track. Unlike the complex, fragmented emissions from manufacturing and global supply chains, AI's carbon footprint stems primarily from data centers, which are fixed physical locations with measurable electricity consumption. This creates clear accountability, as we can directly attribute these emissions to specific technology providers and data center operators.\nAI's traceability can skew public and corporate attention toward it over other potentially more significant sources of emissions that are harder to quantify. For many companies, addressing only AI emissions is a drop in the bucket. To make meaningful progress on climate goals, organizations must work to reduce carbon emissions across all business operations, including their value chain.\nAI as a sustainability enabler\nFocusing solely on AI's carbon footprint misses the opportunity to unlock new reduction and efficiency opportunities.\nEfficiency improvements, often the first step in corporate decarbonization, can be amplified through AI. For example, predictive maintenance prevents energy-wasting malfunctions and extends equipment's life span. Optimizing logistics and supply chains reduces transportation distances and fuel consumption. Intelligently adjusting energy consumption, distribution and storage can maximize efficiency and resource utilization \u2014 all while minimizing costs as well.\nAI is also a powerful enabler for sustainability professionals. AI can support routine tasks like data collection, reporting and drafting communications so teams with limited resources can focus on impactful strategic efforts.\nThese benefits extend to more complex sustainability initiatives, like supply chain decarbonization. AI-powered solutions can inform business planning by aggregating and analyzing supplier data at scale. Teams can quickly detect trends, highlight emissions hotspots and track progress to prioritize action on the most urgent and impactful reduction opportunities. For example, rather than focusing on broad procurement policies, organizations can directly engage suppliers responsible for a disproportionate amount of emissions, resulting in more impactful reductions.\nPredictive modeling enables companies to forecast emissions trends, identify future risks and calculate the impacts of different decarbonization strategies for proactive, long-term business planning and supply chain resilience.\nAs sustainability becomes more integrated across different business functions, AI will help organizations efficiently incorporate these initiatives into their everyday work.\nA word of caution about AI\nAI will not solve climate issues on its own; it's a tool to amplify human efforts. Algorithms are only as good as the data they use. Emissions data \u2014 especially from value chains \u2014 can be sparse, inconsistent or incomplete. AI won't meaningfully fill the gaps, but it will guide teams in their decarbonization strategy.\nIn addition, many AI models are black boxes. This lack of transparency poses a serious problem for emissions reporting, where audibility and traceability are essential. Auditors, investors and regulators need to see the underlying methodology. AI's conclusion may be accurate, but it can't be the foundation of reporting if companies can't explain it.\nHowever, we can't let perfection be the enemy of good. If AI helps you do your job more effectively, and your job is helping decarbonize the planet, then use it.\nWe can't discount AI entirely based on its carbon emissions. Every technology has tradeoffs; anyone in sustainability knows this fact all too well. Sustainability professionals should leverage AI's decarbonization potential while understanding the adverse effects. In the broader context of climate action, AI's energy demands are a challenge \u2014 but not the biggest one we face.\nWe've featured the best green web hosting.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.
