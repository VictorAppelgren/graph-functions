      "feedback": "**Actionable feedback (compact paragraph)**  \nThe draft correctly maps to the canonical handle **dxy** and cites the 0.5–1 % rally with a 3–6‑month horizon, but it drifts into mortgage‑rate and 30‑yr‑yield territory that is not directly tied to the DXY transmission chain. Remove any mention of us_mortgage_rates, 30‑yr Treasury, or US 30‑year yield unless you explicitly link them to the DXY via the 10‑yr yield or term‑premium mechanism (e.g., “higher 10‑yr yields lift mortgage rates, which in turn compress the DXY’s real‑yield differential”). Tighten the causal chain: Fed cut → 2‑yr yield ↓ → 10‑yr yield ↑ (steepening) → real‑yield differential ↑ → DXY ↑. Keep the catalyst window explicit: **Sept 25 Fed meeting** (cut size) and **early‑Aug CPI** (inflation confirmation). Add a concise watch‑list: (1) Sept 25 Fed meeting (cut size & tone), (2) early‑Aug CPI, (3) Aug 30 PCE & Aug 31 NFP, (4) 2‑yr/10‑yr spread trend. Quantify risks: a Fed hike (+10 bp to 10‑yr) or a flattening of the spread below 30 bp would damp the rally; a CPI > 3 % or NFP > expected could push the DXY lower. Ensure every claim has an inline citation (IDs) and that the sign/magnitude is stated (e.g., “DXY will rise 0.5–1 %”). Remove generic statements and focus solely on the DXY‑Fed‑yield nexus.",
