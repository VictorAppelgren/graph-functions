      "feedback": "This analysis shows initiative and use of multiple sources, but to reach world-class quality you should hard-wire a multi-year, first-principles framework and a clear regime map, then translate those anchors into a precise, testable market transmission to asset pricing. Actionable edits: (1) Anchor the horizon with explicit invariants and regime definitions drawn from first principles (e.g., productivity gains from cloud/AI, real rate dynamics, terms-of-trade implications, and policy reaction functions). State regime conditions (e.g., base case: AI/cloud productivity uplift persists with 21% global cloud CAGR 2024–2030; regime shift if cloud demand or AI capex slows beyond a defined band; inflation/real rate path as a function of productivity and wage dynamics) and outline transition triggers. (2) Clarify the causal chain from anchors to pricing: productivity uplift -> cloud/AI capex intensity and backlog (e.g., MSFT FY2025 cloud momentum, $368B contracted revenue backlog) -> durable earnings/FCF growth for platform leaders (MSFT, SHOP, NOW, CRM) -> earnings multiples and discount-rate dynamics -> valuation regime. (3) Fortify the base-case with quantified ranges and cross-checks: cloud CAGR ~21% (cite 0G3A676BP); MSFT backlog and Q4’25 results; Shopify revenue growth 31% YoY and FCF $422M; JUST Capital Workers Leaders vs Russell 1000 (as of 08-22-2025: 35.95% vs 17.18%), Wages Leaders 34.04%, etc. Present these as ranges and sensitivity weights rather than single points. (4) Build a structured scenario tree: Base, Accelerant (AI adoption accelerates, capex inflows beat), Slowdown (AI adoption hiccups), and Stress (macro shock). For each, specify catalysts/triggers (e.g., AI-talent development disclosures per JUST AI program; IBM-style AI workforce planning signals; cloud price/usage dynamics; backlogs turning negative). (5) Add explicit catalysts and invalidation points: e.g., a sharp jump/deterioration in cloud spend, a meaningful wage/inflation shift, regulatory or antitrust shocks to mega-clouds, or a material shift in AI talent development disclosures; cite the corresponding sources (4LQD15CFU for labor-centric evidence; 0G3A676BP for cloud/AI secular growth; TN66GHPAT/JVKCZAPVG for regime-level analogies). (6) Reconcile conflicting evidence and avoid overreliance on tangential analogies: trim the Starsky & Torino/Gran Torino analogy unless you anchor it to data; instead, use the auto example sparingly as a historical illustration of sectoral reallocation, clearly labeled as a qualitative analogue. (7) Sharpen the citation plan: attach claims to the most relevant IDs and, where multiple claims rely on the same source, place a single consolidated citation; ensure each quantitative claim has a source. (8) Improve format to satisfy the SECTION FOCUS: add a concise “base case, key risks, what to watch, and confidence” block; add a compact data appendix with the key numbers and their sources; include a short paragraph on policy/regulatory risk and BoP/terms-of-trade implications for cross-border cloud/investment flows. (9) Tighten the prose for coherence: map the causal chain paragraph-by-paragraph so readers can audit the logic end-to-end, and replace generic statements with the specific numbers and ranges above. (10) Consider removing or heavily recontextualizing DGICB/JHGBQ4TQH-derived points unless you can tie them to a persistent, cross-asset transmission channel; if retained, frame them as illustrative micro-foundations that temper the macro narrative rather than as primary drivers. Overall, implement a transparent, data-backed regime map, a 2–3 page scenario tree with explicit triggers, and a tight base-case with quantified ranges and watch-list metrics, all clearly tied to the listed source IDs for reproducibility.",
