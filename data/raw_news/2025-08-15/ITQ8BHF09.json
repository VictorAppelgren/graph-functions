Generate Key Takeaways\n\n60 Years Ago Today: The Beatles Played the First-Ever Major Stadium Rock Concert originally appeared on Parade.\n\nSix decades ago, the loudest sound in New York wasn\u2019t a jet overhead\u2014it was 55,600 fans screaming for four guys from Liverpool.\n\nOn August 15, 1965, The Beatles walked onto a stage planted over second base at Shea Stadium and made music history. It was the first major stadium rock concert, the night Beatlemania scaled up to sports-arena size, and the blueprint for every mega-tour that came after.\n\nFast forward to today, the New York Mets are honoring that milestone with The Beatles Night at Citi Field as they host the Seattle Mariners. The celebration includes a pregame set by tribute band 1964 The Tribute at the Shea Bridge starting at 6:15 p.m., a Shea Stadium replica for the first 15,000 fans, and a Beatles-soundtracked fireworks show after the game. Even members of the 1965 gameday staff are returning to throw out the first pitch.\n\n\ud83c\udfac SIGN UP for Parade's Daily newsletter to get the latest pop culture news & celebrity interviews delivered right to your inbox \ud83c\udfac\n\nBack in \u201965, the idea of a rock band filling a baseball stadium was untested. Promoter Sid Bernstein booked it anyway, selling tickets for about $4.50 to $5.65. The gamble paid off. The Beatles, made up of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, brought in roughly $304,000 (pocketing $160,000), which Bernstein proudly called \u201cthe greatest gross ever in the history of show business.\u201d\n\nIntroducing them that night was Ed Sullivan, the TV host who had famously introduced the band to America a year earlier, declaring, \u201cHonored by their country, decorated by their Queen, and loved here in America\u2026 here are The Beatles!\u201d\n\nThe setlist was short by today\u2019s standards\u2014just 12 songs including \u201cTwist and Shout,\u201d \u201cTicket to Ride,\u201d \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night,\u201d and \u201cHelp!\u201d\u2014but it hardly mattered. In a 2015 interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Starr recalled that the band \u201ccouldn\u2019t hear [themselves]\u201d over the wall of screaming fans, who \u201cjust screamed until we bowed and left.\u201d\n\nAnd the frenzy didn\u2019t stop when the music did. According to The Washington Post, the group had to be rushed off the field in a white station wagon driven by Shea groundskeeper Pete Flynn, then transferred to an armored truck to make their escape.\n\nCelebrities were in the stands too: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Marvin Gaye, plus future Beatles spouses Linda Eastman and Barbara Bach. The whole thing was filmed with 14 cameras and later aired as The Beatles at Shea Stadium, though several songs were overdubbed in post-production to fix the audio lost in the chaos.\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 SIGN UP for our The Voice newsletter to get access to exclusive news, interviews, insider info, sneak peeks & more \ud83c\udfa4\n\nMcCartney would later call it \u201cmagic\u2014just walls of people,\u201d as he recalled in The Beatles Anthology. Lennon described it as \u201cthe top of the mountain,\u201d a line he repeated in multiple interviews about the Shea concert. In one night, they proved stadium concerts could work, paving the way for everyone from Elton John to Taylor Swift.\n\n60 Years Ago Today: The Beatles Played the First-Ever Major Stadium Rock Concert first appeared on Parade on Aug 15, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by Parade on Aug 15, 2025, where it first appeared.",

I'm not sure why I thought I wouldn't, but something just didn't seem right about it. I'm glad I didn't go with that feeling. It is truly awesome and congers up every emotion I think I'm capable of. I know plenty of people who are not Beatles fans, but I would encourage them to still give this a chance since it really is so much more than just the story of a band.\nIt's been said to me countless times of films that are well over two hours long.

If you are interested in how the best 14 albums ever made came to be, you have to see the whole thing.\nThe story is told in the words of the Beatles themselves, and a couple others like George Martin and Neil Aspinall (their chief roadie). Along with footage from concerts and their movies, it's several interviews editted together, but you never hear the interviewers, you only hear Paul or George or Ringo or John's response to the question, and it comes together into a seamless history of the greatest band Rock and Roll ever knew.\nThe story is told in the words of the Beatles themselves, and a couple others like George Martin and Neil Aspinall (their chief roadie).

For instance, who could tell with more believability that George didn't like the album Sgt. Pepper that much than George himself ? In this sense this anthology is very important, because all the information comes directly from the Beatles themselves. This DVD set contains additional comments by Niel Aspenall, and George Martin that's never been seen elsewhere which reveals the back stories about the production of Beatles' music, their earlier days on the road etc. Watch this anthology with video \"The Compleat Beatles\", \"Making of A Hard Days Night\" and \"The making of Sgt. Pepper\" (broadcasted, but unreleased in video) you should get pretty much the whole picture of the Beatles.\nIf I had one complaint about this DVD set, it's that the music is recorded so much louder than the voice track, and is difficult to find the right volume level to listen to. But of all the Beatles documentary videos that are out there, this one still is the best.\nIf I had one complaint about this DVD set, it's that the music is recorded so much louder than the voice track, and is difficult to find the right volume level to listen to. But of all the Beatles documentary videos that are out there, this one still is the best.\nIf you could roll the respective significance of `Citizen Kane,' `Gone With the Wind' and `Lawrence of Arabia' into one film, you might have somewhat of an idea what the Beatles mean to contemporary music. Indeed, while Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly laid the groundwork, the Beatles forever defined the musical and artistic boundaries by which all future pop players would be judged. Indeed, the DVD format has provided modern day audiences with a chance to see why the Fab Four's legacy is something much more significant than a mere history lesson. `The Beatles Anthology' (released April 1, 2003 on DVD) picks up where the 2002-issued collector's edition release of `A Hard Day's Night' left off, providing more insight into the minds and music of the band that put Liverpool on the map. In addition to the in-depth chronology taking viewers on a magical mystery trip through the 1960s, new and never-before-seen material features interviews with Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and the late George Harrison at Abbey Road Studios in May 1995 as they listen to classic Beatles tracks with producer George Martin. The jewel of the release is additional footage of the three one-time mop tops jamming together in George Harrison's garden.\nDVD extras? You get them here. Indeed, the DVD release features a bonus disc featuring approximately 80 minutes of material more than the deluxe, eight-volume VHS release that expanded on the ABC special broadcast on Nov. 19, 22 and 23, 1995. Needless to say, all fans of rock music and 20th century pop culture should own this collection.\nDVD extras? You get them here.

Needless to say, all fans of rock music and 20th century pop culture should own this collection.\nThis is a staggering, fantastic eight-part documentary on the history of the Beatles as a group and as individuals, an oral history by them and those closest to them, including George Martin and Neil Aspinall, their tour director.\nBesides the Beatles music showcased so beautifully throughout the anthology, probably the best thing is the filmed discussions of Paul, George, and Ringo sitting around a kitchen table discussing their shared past. For me, the other remarkable thing is how they, in fact, seemed to have invented the music video without realizing it.\nThe anthology goes into quite a bit of detail not only about how the guys grew up, got interested in music, got together, and got started but also a lot about what it was like to be \"The Beatles\" and how they collaborated. Their story is remarkable because, unlike a lot of other groups, they were always together -- not only making music but on vacations, in India, making movies, and in hotel rooms. They were kids together. And when they grew up, the band ended.\nThere's not much else to say because if you're a Beatles fan, a baby boomer, whatever you are, you have to see this and experience it in all its brilliance. The end, with \"Free as a Bird,\" is heartwrenching.\nThis anthology is exciting, funny, bittersweet, sad, entertaining, and thought-provoking. What can I say? It's the Beatles.\nBesides the Beatles music showcased so beautifully throughout the anthology, probably the best thing is the filmed discussions of Paul, George, and Ringo sitting around a kitchen table discussing their shared past.

The three surviving Beatles added instrumentation to the demos and released the songs as singles in conjunction with the release of the special. In addition, John hadn't filled in the middle eight section of the demo for \"Free As A Bird\", so the surviving Beatles wrote a new section for that, which, according to Paul, was one of the reasons for choosing the song. It allowed them some input.\n- GoofsPaul McCartney says, \"We told Brian 'We're not going to America, until we are #1 there'\". However, in actuality, Brian Epstein made arrangements for the Beatles to appear on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in New York in November 1963, some three months before the Beatles had their first #1 in America.\n- Quotes\nGeorge Harrison: [on The Beatles' second visit to Shea Stadium] Yeah, okay I don't remember ever going there twice...\n- Alternate versionsThe performance of \"All You Need Is Love\" from the TV special Our World (1967) was originally in black and white but was colorized for the purpose of this documentary.
