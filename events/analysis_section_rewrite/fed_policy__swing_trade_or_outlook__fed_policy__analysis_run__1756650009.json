      "feedback": "Adjust the Down‑scenario probabilities to match the 70 % base‑case probability that a Fed cut will push DXY lower: set the first Down line’s probability to 70 % (citing Z7O1DCHS7) and the second to 30–40 % (citing XTQIQRP5K). In the Swing Trade line, change the probability to 70 % (confidence stays 70) and keep the invalidation as “Fed September cut”; the trigger should read “Fed September meeting & 2‑yr/10‑yr spread <30 bp” (Z7O1DCHS7, 7XH2DKEKV). Remove the mortgage‑rate paragraph unless you add a clear causal sentence linking higher mortgage rates to a tighter term premium that lifts UST10Y and compresses DXY, reinforcing the Fed‑cut scenario. Verify every driver/mechanism line has an explicit causal link to DXY and that all IDs are present. Keep the Up/Down lines to exactly four lines with no extra commentary, and ensure the trade entry/stop/target dates align with the 2025‑09‑15 horizon.",
