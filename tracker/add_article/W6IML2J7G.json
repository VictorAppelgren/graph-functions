      "summary": "The article examines why the United States has a C‑section rate far above the World Health Organization’s recommended 10–15%, highlighting that many procedures are medically unnecessary and driven by hospital policies, financial incentives, and liability concerns. It follows Kelsey Birch’s experience of an unexpected C‑section after a seemingly uncomplicated labor, illustrating how hospital culture and profit motives can push for surgery even when not medically required. Business Insider’s analysis of data from Florida, Mississippi, and Iowa shows dramatic variations in C‑section rates between nearby hospitals, underscoring the influence of institutional practices over patient risk factors. The piece also discusses legal cases, such as the DOJ indictment of Chesapeake Regional Medical Center, and state-level initiatives—particularly in California—that have successfully reduced low‑risk C‑section rates through transparency, leadership support, and nursing empowerment. Overall, the article argues that reducing unnecessary C‑sections requires systemic changes in hospital culture, reimbursement models, and regulatory oversight.",
