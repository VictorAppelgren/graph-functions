  "content": "Nick Griggs won a bronze medal in the men's 1500m at the Irish National Championships at Morton Stadium.\n\nThe race was won by Cathal Doyle, while Andrew Coscoran, who earlier won the men's 5000m, finished second.\n\nEuropean Under-23 silver medallist Griggs and Michael Power led a steady first lap and the race settled into a tactical battle.\n\nDoyle had manoeuvred to the front by the bell, and Griggs showed a good kick heading into the final 100m as he tried to chase down the Olympic 1500m semi-finalist.\n\nHowever, the 20-year-old came up just short of Doyle, who won in a time of 3:53.60, and the charging Coscoran (3:53.84) beat Griggs (3:53.90) to the line to take second.\n\nWhile Olympian sprinter Rhasidat Adeleke and heptathlete Kate O'Connor were absent from the meeting, sprinter Sarah Lavin - one of the star attractions - won the women's 100 metre hurdles.\n\nFellow Olympian Coscoran beat Brian Fay in a tight men's 5000m final, while Sharlene Mawdsley claimed the women's 200m on Saturday ahead of Lavin.\n\nMawdsley withdrew from the 400m after her earlier medal, and that final was won by her 4x400m Paris team-mate Sophie Becker.\n\nJack Raftery claimed gold in the men's 400m, while Mark English won the men's 800m final.\n\nCiara Neville and Bori Akinola won their respective women's and men's 100m finals, and Alex O'Neill pipped Sarah Healy in the women's 800m race.\n\nAfter winning silver medals at the European Under-23 championships and the World University Games, Nicola Tuthill won the women's hammer throw at the Morton Stadium with a throw of 71.75m.",
