  "title": "'Scalpel,' not an 'ax': Why many Indianapolis departments could face budget cuts in 2026",
  "description": "State property tax reforms and higher labor costs have put Indianapolis officials in a tight spot as they prepare the 2026 budget.",
  "content": "Indianapolis officials are asking department heads \u2014 except those who lead public safety agencies \u2014 to reduce their annual budgets by about 4% heading into 2026 as the city adjusts to higher labor costs, lower property tax revenue forecasts due to Senate Bill 1 and other state policy changes.\n\nWithout those proposed cuts, city leaders would be staring down a roughly $43 million budget deficit caused in part by property tax reforms passed by state lawmakers this spring, City Controller Abby Hanson told IndyStar in a recent interview. After Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett made clear that he wanted to present the city's 10th straight balanced budget with no tax increases, Hanson is pushing most departments to cut 4% of their budgets that \"we could live without.\" Officials are also asking the local police, sheriff's and fire departments to limit their budget growth to 2%.\n\n\"Frankly, the amount of property taxes that I was expecting us to have in 2026, that didn't come to fruition,\" Hanson said in an exclusive Aug. 6 interview with IndyStar, noting that property taxes accounted for about a third of city revenues in 2025. \"That's not the amount of growth that we ended up having.\"\n\nExperts have warned that SB 1, which is forecast to reduce property tax growth by $1.4 billion statewide from 2026 to 2028, would force local governments to tighten their belts and could force hard decisions about whether to cut public services in the coming years. Starting next year, cities will start collecting less money as homeowners earn tax credits that lower their property tax bills by up to $300.\n\nA state analysis shows that under the new law, the Indianapolis city-county and Marion County governments will miss out on about $11 million in expected property tax revenue growth in 2026. But Hanson said the actual loss is nearly $18 million after factoring in separate taxing districts that are split up in the analysis, including the police, fire and sanitation.\n\nSB 1 was a component of the revenue shortfall, but not the only factor. New multi-year labor contracts that the city signed with public sector unions at the end of 2024, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the Indianapolis Professional Firefighters Union, have significantly increased its expenses.\n\nThe four-year contract with the FOP includes annual pay raises for officers across the board and boosted the starting salary for an Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officer to nearly $75,000 in 2025, according to the contract. A patrol officer with three years of service is set to earn nearly $88,000 in 2026. Hanson also said a state change that increased the pension rates paid to firefighters and police officers will cost the city more money.\n\nIn 2025 the city spent nearly $1 billion, or 60%, of its $1.65 billion budget on public safety and criminal justice services including the Indianapolis police and fire departments, the Marion County sheriff's and prosecutor's offices, and the Marion County courts.\n\nWhere exactly the 4% reductions show up in city services will become clearer during months of budget negotiations that formally begin at the Aug. 11 City-County Council meeting. Presentations by Hogsett and Hanson that night will kick off weeks of hearings at which each department presents its budget to council committees.\n\nHogsett's Chief of Staff Dan Parker told IndyStar that despite the cuts, no \"significant\" city programs will disappear next year and new investments will still be announced. The growth of the overall budget is expected to be in line with previous years, too, although city officials would not cite an exact amount. The $1.65 billion 2025 budget was about 6% higher than the 2024 budget.\n\n\"This wasn\u2019t an ax being taken to the budget,\" Parker said. \"It was really more of a scalpel because we empowered the agencies to look at their budgets.\"\n\nCity preparing to get $100 million in new road funding by 2027\n\nThe city will also set up a new fund for the Department of Public Works that draws mainly on organic growth in local income tax revenues, with the goal of raising $50 million in new money to spend on roads by 2027, Parker said. Starting that year, the state will offer up to $50 million a year in matching grants to help Indianapolis repair its battered roads.\n\nParker said the new state program will make amends for a road-funding formula that disregards lane and traffic counts, sending the same amount of money to a two-lane road in a rural county and a six-lane road in Indianapolis. If the city earns the full matching grant, Indy would spend $100 million more each year on roads.\n\nThe city's 2025 budget for roads, bridges and greenways was about $200 million.\n\n\"The mayor\u2019s position was that Marion County residents were overpaying into a state system where they weren\u2019t getting their fair share,\" Parker said. \"Well, with this bill we're now eligible to get our fair share, and so we want to make sure this budget lays the foundation to be able to get that $50 million and put even more dollars out into road construction.\"\n\nEmail IndyStar Reporter Jordan Smith at JTsmith@gannett.com.

      "text": "Indy's road budget has doubled in recent years. It's not enough -- and it won't last.\nCameron Ridle's 36,000-pound school bus rattles deafeningly when he traverses the potholed neighborhood streets off Harding Street on the south side every day.\nJulian Avenue in Irvington takes a bumpy turn for the worse west of Ritter Avenue, with steel rebar poking through and sporadic potholes and patches that make for a \"pretty twisted game of reverse-Frogger,\" resident Justin Harter said.\nAlong 8,400 lane miles of road in Indianapolis, the list of needs is endless.\nThe chronic underfunding of infrastructure in Indianapolis has been a refrain in city budget hearings for years.\nThe Department of Public Works has made significant inroads: in 2017, it programmed about $35 million worth of street work, including reconstruction and resurfacing, in its capital plan. In 2022, $73 million is allocated to these line items.\nBut it still won't be enough.\nState funding formulas designed decades ago have long disproportionately shorted highly trafficked urban areas like Indianapolis of money for fixing up roads, local officials and experts say. There have been large, one-time injections of capital into the problem in the past, which leads to a roller-coaster pattern of investment that has left roads worse for wear.\nThough the city has more than doubled its roads budget over the last five years, the investment still doesn't come close to engineers' estimates for what the city needs \u2014 and the high funding levels are expected to drop off, once again, in a few years.\nMore than half of Indianapolis' streets are \"poor\" as of 2020, according to the most recent asset management report from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Organization. A quarter are \"fair,\" and just a fifth are \"good.\"\nA DPW audit in 2018 estimated it would take $732 million to get the city streets that are in \"poor\" condition up to a \"fair\" rating, then another $178 million a year to maintain the streets' current level. This year, the department has contracted with an engineering firm to update these estimates.\nFrom 2018: Making Indy's streets \u2018fair\u2019 would take 10 times the current budget\n\"I know it\u2019s not DPW\u2019s fault; it\u2019s a systemic issue that\u2019s gone on for far too long,\" councillor Joshua Bain said just before the public works committee approved their portion of the 2022 budget on Oct. 7. \"And unfortunately it looks like we\u2019re going to be kicking the can down the road again.\"\nWhy is it this way?\nAccording to part of the state road funding formula, a 5-mile stretch of the six-lane Keystone Avenue in Indianapolis gets apportioned the same amount of road money from the state as 5 miles of a one-lane road in rural Ohio County, population 6,000.\nWhen the pot of money is divided by the amount of vehicle traffic on the roads, Ohio County gets about $20 per vehicle-mile traveled, while Marion County gets just above $3. On this metric, Marion County ranks last of the 92 counties, according to an analysis of state data by Policy Analytics for the Indianapolis Office of Finance and Management.\nThis is because this part of the state formula distributes road funding based on the number of miles of road in a given county, in terms of the road's center line \u2014 not accounting for the number of lanes. Other smaller variables in the formula include population and vehicle registrations.\nThe road funding that the state has available to distribute comes mostly from gas taxes. Depending on the year, this funding source is about a fifth of Indianapolis' capital infrastructure budget; up to a third in a given year is federal money, which usually requires local dollars to match, meaning another third of the budget would be local dollars.\nThose local dollars come through property taxes, parking meter profits and, in the last couple years, county-based income tax distributions. The rest of the money in a given capital budget comes from bond proceeds and a series of other small pots, like neighborhood partnerships or special development-oriented tax financing districts.\nRead: What you need to know about state and federal gas taxes\nThe gas tax distribution formula has been this way since before Purdue University professor Kumares Sinha started working in the field \u2014 45 years ago.\n\"For a long time, I felt that this formula needs revisiting, because the world has changed quite a bit,\" he said.\nUrbanized areas have grown; truck traffic has proliferated. The merger of Indianapolis and Marion County in 1970 meant the city's boundaries expanded, and the city-county provides road services to some \"excluded\" municipalities whose populations don't count toward the state fuel tax distribution.\n\"The fair thing is to do lane miles \u2014 there\u2019s no question about that,\" Sinha said. He also has lobbied for the impacts of truck traffic, which cause the most road damage, to figure into the distribution formula.\nWith insufficient infrastructure funding a chronic problem throughout the nation, and with local governments in Indiana not having much leeway to raise money, the key is to spend smart, Sinha said.\n\"When you don't have enough to do what you need, you have to prioritize,\" said city-county councillor Zach Adamson, chair of the public works committee since 2012. \"That's why residential streets don't get done.\"\nWhat gets prioritized is the thoroughfares that benefit the largest number of people.\nThe $25 million earmarked for neighborhood streets next year through the Circle City Forward initiative is a rare infusion of cash for non-thoroughfares that was only possible because of a once-a-century pandemic during which the city saved up more money than it ended up needing.\nThe city has also been shorted tens of millions of dollars over 12 years because of an error in the state formula that officials only caught in 2019.\nIn addition to center-line miles, how the state distributes gas tax funds depends partly on the population within the geographical area that the fire department covers. Indianapolis' fire service district grew in 2007 to include five more townships, but the state formula was not adjusted.\nThe correction in the formula was estimated to benefit Indianapolis by about $12 million a year, beginning in 2020. Because the pandemic quashed travel, that extra influx actually kept DPW's gas tax revenue flat, but in 2021, it's on the rise again.\nThe city never got backpay for those lost years, DPW spokesperson Ben Easley said.\nFunding roller coaster\nThe funding formula is one part of the problem. The other is the cyclical, roller-coaster nature of infrastructure funding in the city.\nIn past years, large injections of money have either come from tax increases or sales of large assets. In 2010, Mayor Greg Ballard created a $450 million infrastructure fund called Rebuild Indy by selling the city's water utility. Between 2010 and 2014, that money comprised at least half the infrastructure capital budgets. The 2011 infrastructure budget rocketed up to more than $200 million, before falling again below $100 million the next year.\nThe vast majority of street work done through Rebuild Indy was resurfacing the top layer of roads, which left them vulnerable to potholes and cracks only a few years later. The money ran out in 2016, and the city doesn't have any more large assets to sell.\nA particularly volatile freeze-thaw cycle of the winter of 2018 created a memorable pothole season for city leaders, and led to a paradigm shift in the Department of Public works, which now uses capital dollars almost exclusively for more extensive, full-depth reconstruction on roadways in the hopes the investment lasts longer.\nThis is more expensive and means fewer road miles get done at once, but they also have to get done less often. It's tough to quantify this impact, though, because variables like the size of DPW's budget and material costs have both changed since the Ballard administration.\n\"We saw the reality of that deferred maintenance,\" said Taylor Schaffer, Mayor Joe Hogsett's chief of staff, referring to that brutal winter of 2018. \"As a result, from nearly day one, the administration has thought creatively about how we were deploying funds for transportation infrastructure.\"\nHow the budget grew\nHogsett's first budget, for 2017, included a capital improvement program proposing to spend $200 million on transportation infrastructure over four years. This includes roads, bridges, sidewalks, greenways, infrastructure supporting mass transit, and more.\nParker's first budget as public works director, for 2018, proposed $300 million over four years. The budget city-council just approved, for 2022, proposes $518 million over the next four years.\nThe difference between the peaks: In 2017, the city programmed $78 million of transportation capital projects; in 2023, it's programming $204 million worth.\nThe biggest windfall has been the change to the state gas tax \u2014 the aforementioned source of consternation.\nIn 2017, the Indiana state legislature approved a 10 cent increase in the state gas tax, which the city projected would bring in an extra $10 million to $18 million a year.\nThis was fuel for $120 million in bonds that DPW began implementing with the 2019 budget \u2014 borrowing against future anticipated gas tax revenue.\nThe rest of the budget has built up over the years with a series of smaller adjustments that add up.\nCity officials in the last five years made more aggressive use of Tax Increment Financing, or TIF, for road work. TIF is a common public financing method that diverts future anticipated property tax revenue increases within a geographic area into the economic development of that area. In the 2018 budget, the administration diverted $3 million of TIF funding into infrastructure; that annual allocation estimate has jumped to more than $9 million.\nAnother small slice of the thicker pie is the Indianapolis Neighborhood Infrastructure Partnership program, in which private community organizations match city dollars for improvement projects like trails, sidewalks, streets and pedestrian bridges. This program adds about $2 million to $4 million to the capital budget. Typically at least half of the projects selected are roads.\nThe city also started in 2018 to allocate county-option income supplemental tax distribution to infrastructure, rather than to the city's general fund, which has meant anywhere from $6 million to $17 million a year.\nOne significant caveat to the larger capital plans is that in 2021, DPW started including in the plans projects it works on with Department of Metropolitan Development dollars. This has meant additions anywhere from $9 million to $50 million to one year's capital plan \u2014 but money that is still going toward infrastructure.\nCost-cutting measures have helped the city make balanced budgets and grow its fund balance and fiscal stability fund, controller Ken Clark said, allowing major local investments like Circle City Forward. A balanced budget also means better credit, which means lower interest rates on bonds.\nFederal funding, which is distributed by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization, has largely stayed consistent over the years at around $20-25 million. Of the $420 million the city received through the American Rescue Plan this year, it is allocating $50 million specifically to stormwater capital improvements \u2014 a separate plan from the transportation capital plan.\n\"Infrastructure has always been a part of any of the major investments we\u2019ve made, and in each budget as well,\" Clark said.\nThe increases in capital investment have accompanied an increase in operational investment and a restructuring of the public works department.\n\"Everybody falls in love with capital projects, but a capital project will fall apart very quickly if you don\u2019t take care of it,\" Parker said.\nThe future\nSeveral of the funding fixes that has bolstered Indianapolis' capital infrastructure budget over the last 5 years will soon run out.\nThe county-option income tax distribution will no longer appear in the infrastructure budget beginning in 2022. The $120 million of bonds have all been allocated through 2023, as have the Circle City Forward funds.\nSo the predicted level of funding sources drops from $182 million in 2023 down to about $75 million for each of 2024 and 2025. Economic development dollars from the Department of Metropolitan Development have not been forecasted yet for those years, but even another $30 million here wouldn't make up for the drop-off.\nThis comes right as many bridges built in the 1950s and 1960s will reach the end of their useful lives.\nThe city manages 510 roadway bridges, 60% of which are 50 years old, and 20% of which are over 70 years old, according to the Marion County Bridge Inventory, a DPW spokesperson said.\nWithout a new consistent source of revenue like the gas tax increase, the department can't borrow a huge amount of money again.\n\"We found money wherever we could to plug into this, but ultimately, a long-term funding plan is not going to come from city-county council,\" Parker said.\nThe city can't adequately rebuild and maintain itself with these ups and downs, but needs a consistently high budget, Parker said.\nAdamson would like to see a start with the state gas tax formula. But even here, there are two problems.\nChanging state formulas is a tough task \u2014 there are always both winners and losers.\n\"A lot of people don\u2019t like to go back to this because it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box,\" Sinha said. \"Who will lose, who will gain? There are a lot of vested interests involved.\"\nRelying on a gas-based tax as a revenue source is increasingly shaky as vehicles get more efficient and electric, while they continue to contribute to the wear and tear of the roads.\n\"More cars on the road, cars are more efficient, less funding \u2014 this is a recipe for disaster,\" Adamson said.\nSince 1985, Sinha has been proposing to state legislators a shift to road funding based on vehicle miles traveled, but he said political will and polarization have stood in the way. It's more likely that the proliferation of electric vehicles will eventually force the state's hand in a decade or so, he said.\nState law prohibits the city from raising taxes on its own, but even if it could, it might not be fair to Marion County residents, Adamson said. There are another 200,000 non-residents who commute to Marion County and use its roads every day.\nIndyStar reached out to state legislators Jim Pressel, R-LaPorte, and Michael Crider, R-Greenfield, who chair the House and Senate transportation committees, respectively, to comment on the disparities local officials highlight and whether these discussions would appear on the legislative agenda this year. Press secretaries said they were not available for comment.\nHowever, since this is not a budget year, the General Assembly is unlikely to address road funding issues.\nBefore Parker can advocate for specific funding fixes, he wants to figure out the new magic number: the dollar amount to its unmet infrastructure needs. The department is currently contracted with an engineering firm to do so.\nUntil then, Adamson continues to respond to the same complaints with the same reality.\n\"Your sentiments are felt across this department,\" he told Bain on Oct. 7. \"We agree 100%. But it\u2019s really not within our control.\"\nContact IndyStar transportation reporter Kayla Dwyer at kdwyer@indystar.com or follow her on Twitter @kayla_dwyer17."

      "text": "'Scalpel,' not an 'ax': Why many Indianapolis departments could face budget cuts in 2026\n- Some budget cuts are likely as the Indianapolis city-county government is expected to lose millions in property tax revenues starting in 2026 due to SB 1.\n- While public safety agencies will continue to grow, most city departments are being asked to trim their costs for 2026.\n- The city will set up a new fund to collect tax revenue that could lead to $100 million more being spent on roads by 2027.\nIndianapolis officials are asking department heads \u2014 except those who lead public safety agencies \u2014 to reduce their annual budgets by about 4% heading into 2026 as the city adjusts to higher labor costs, lower property tax revenue forecasts due to Senate Bill 1 and other state policy changes.\nWithout those proposed cuts, city leaders would be staring down a roughly $43 million budget deficit caused in part by property tax reforms passed by state lawmakers this spring, City Controller Abby Hanson told IndyStar in a recent interview.

But Hanson said the actual loss is nearly $18 million after factoring in separate taxing districts that are split up in the analysis, including the police, fire and sanitation.\nSB 1 was a component of the revenue shortfall, but not the only factor. New multi-year labor contracts that the city signed with public sector unions at the end of 2024, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the Indianapolis Professional Firefighters Union, have significantly increased its expenses.\nThe four-year contract with the FOP includes annual pay raises for officers across the board and boosted the starting salary for an Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officer to nearly $75,000 in 2025, according to the contract. A patrol officer with three years of service is set to earn nearly $88,000 in 2026. Hanson also said a state change that increased the pension rates paid to firefighters and police officers will cost the city more money.\nIn 2025 the city spent nearly $1 billion, or 60%, of its $1.65 billion budget on public safety and criminal justice services including the Indianapolis police and fire departments, the Marion County sheriff's and prosecutor's offices, and the Marion County courts.\nMonths of Indianapolis budget hearings begin Aug. 11\nWhere exactly the 4% reductions show up in city services will become clearer during months of budget negotiations that formally begin at the Aug. 11 City-County Council meeting. Presentations by Hogsett and Hanson that night will kick off weeks of hearings at which each department presents its budget to council committees.\nHogsett's Chief of Staff Dan Parker told IndyStar that despite the cuts, no \"significant\" city programs will disappear next year and new investments will still be announced. The growth of the overall budget is expected to be in line with previous years, too, although city officials would not cite an exact amount. The $1.65 billion 2025 budget was about 6% higher than the 2024 budget.\n\"This wasn\u2019t an ax being taken to the budget,\" Parker said. \"It was really more of a scalpel because we empowered the agencies to look at their budgets.\"\nCity preparing to get $100 million in new road funding by 2027\nThe city will also set up a new fund for the Department of Public Works that draws mainly on organic growth in local income tax revenues, with the goal of raising $50 million in new money to spend on roads by 2027, Parker said. Starting that year, the state will offer up to $50 million a year in matching grants to help Indianapolis repair its battered roads.\nParker said the new state program will make amends for a road-funding formula that disregards lane and traffic counts, sending the same amount of money to a two-lane road in a rural county and a six-lane road in Indianapolis. If the city earns the full matching grant, Indy would spend $100 million more each year on roads.\nThe city's 2025 budget for roads, bridges and greenways was about $200 million.\n\"The mayor\u2019s position was that Marion County residents were overpaying into a state system where they weren\u2019t getting their fair share,\" Parker said. \"Well, with this bill we're now eligible to get our fair share, and so we want to make sure this budget lays the foundation to be able to get that $50 million and put even more dollars out into road construction.\"\nEmail IndyStar Reporter Jordan Smith at JTsmith@gannett.com.

      "text": "Indy council passes budget despite 'no' votes over police, roads concerns\nIndianapolis City-County Council passed next year's $1.6 billion budget Monday, despite concerns from some councilors about Mayor Joe Hogsett's approach to infrastructure and public safety.\nThe budget was approved 16-9 \u2014 the narrowest budget approval margin in recent years \u2014 with three Democratic councilors and all six Republicans opposing it.\n\u201cBasic city government priorities are not being met in this budget, such as the public safety, infrastructure and economic development that happens outside of downtown,\u201d Republican minority leader Brian Mowery said. \u201cWith this being so woefully underfunded, and the fact that we cannot continue to just throw money at things and hope it gets better \u2026 I will be voting no for this budget tonight.\u201d\nCouncilors Rena Allen and Carlos Perkins, both Democrats voting no, voiced their objections in a joint press conference with members of the Black Church Coalition.\nAllen denounced mindlessly throwing money at police without addressing what would sustain growth.\n\u201cExpenditures like law enforcement are out of tune with our community needs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should make real investments in officers' mental health and wellness for our existing officers, not budgeting for roles we are unlikely to fill.\u201d\nHogsett\u2019s budget included an $8.1 million increase in personnel services to \"fully fund\u201d 1,743 sworn officers.

Here's why.\n\u201cOur frugal approach to how we manage our money controls our spending, but it also leads to the degradation of a lot of these issues we talked about.

The people who come here \u2026 they don't pay a penny for all that overtime.\u201d\nHogsett released a statement highlighting that the budget is his eighth consecutive one without a tax increase.\n\u201cDespite ongoing labor negotiations and a year of tight revenue growth for the City and County, this 2025 budget shows our support for our employees and the important work they do each and every day to serve residents, as well as continues to fund successful city programs that we know are making Indianapolis a better, safer place for all,\u201d the statement said.\nMichael McDaniel is the city and county government reporter at IndyStar.

      "text": "SB 1 cut property taxes. But will local governments hike income taxes? How much you could pay\n- Indiana's SEA 1 will provide property tax relief to homeowners and businesses, with businesses receiving the largest cuts.\n- Local governments can offset property tax revenue by increasing income taxes. That could mean some families pay over $1,000 more per year on income taxes.\n- Cities across Indiana are evaluating the impact of SB 1 and considering measures like hiring freezes and delays to infrastructure projects.\nIn northern Indiana, the Democratic mayor of South Bend called Senate Bill 1 a \"sweeping anti-growth policy\" that sabotages local governments.\nIn southern Indiana, the Republican mayor of Jeffersonville responded with cost-cutting measures including a hiring freeze on all but \"essential and critical\" roles and tighter restrictions on overtime and work-related travel.\nAnd in Central Indiana, Noblesville\u2019s Republican mayor is contemplating new income taxes and delays to major infrastructure projects as he expects his city to miss out on tens of millions in property tax revenue over the next few years.\nMuch remains unclear as municipal leaders reckon with how much property tax revenue they stand to miss out on from the 345-page SB 1, an overhaul of local government finance signed into law by Indiana Gov. Mike Braun April 15. Tax revenues will still increase as property values keep rising, but by far less than local leaders had expected under the current system.\nWith lost revenues statewide at an estimated $1.4 billion from 2026 to 2028, local leaders say that years of belt-tightening will entail tough decisions about how to maintain crucial services like road maintenance, public education and emergency response systems.\nMultiple experts say they expect most communities to increase income taxes come 2027, which could completely offset the property tax savings for the typical Indiana homeowner and wring out more money with no relief from the nearly 30% of Hoosiers who rent.\nMany communities could tax a Hoosier family with an income near the median $80,000 over $1,000 more per year, according to Michael Hicks, a Ball State University economist who leads the university's Center for Business and Economic Research.\n\"The income tax increases are delayed a year, so we will have a year of tax cuts and service cuts before we start seeing schools, counties and cities scrambling to plug budget holes,\" Hicks told IndyStar.\nThe tax cuts, he added, \"take an awful lot out of local government and expose an awful lot of taxpayers to potentially paying a much higher income tax.\"\nHow the new law helps homeowners, businesses\nThe new law will save most homeowners some money, mainly through tax credits of 10% on their property tax bill, with a $300 max credit. Wealthier homeowners will receive the full $300 while most homeowners whose assessed value falls below $300,000 will save less, aside from added relief for seniors, veterans and people with disabilities.\nRepublicans say they expect two-thirds of homeowners to pay a lower property tax bill in 2026 than they will this year.\nBusinesses will receive the most tax relief as the minimum threshold for filing taxes on business equipment, such as computers and machinery, rises from $80,000 to $2 million by 2027, meaning most Indiana businesses won\u2019t pay any property tax, according to Hicks. Cuts to taxes on depreciating business equipment bought after Jan. 1 will also drain money from local coffers over the next decade, Hicks said.\nHow local income taxes could offset property tax savings\nCrucially, the bill allows cities and towns to make up for lost revenue by imposing income taxes, which are currently applied at the county level. Most homeowners are likely to see their property tax savings offset by higher income taxes levied by local governments desperate to shore up their budgets, multiple public policy experts told IndyStar.\nThe governor and Republican legislators tout that the law will reduce the local income tax cap in each county from 3.75% to 2.9%.\nBecause most counties already impose a rate well below 2.9%, however, the new law is still likely to increase the income tax that most people pay, said Paul Helmke, a former three-term Republican mayor of Fort Wayne who now teaches public policy at Indiana University.\nUnder the current system in which local governments rely heavily on property taxes, only seven of the state\u2019s 92 counties have local income tax rates over 2.8%. Marion County\u2019s levy, for instance, is 2.02%, while Hamilton County's rate is 1.1%.\nDwindling property tax revenues will strain local leaders\u2019 ability to deliver high-quality services like a robust police department or well-maintained parks without somehow scraping together more revenue, Helmke said.\nIt\u2019s possible that local governments won\u2019t take the political risk of setting tax rates near the 2.9% cap, Helmke said, but the corresponding quality-of-life reductions could prove even more unpopular.\n\"For the elected officials, the challenge is going to be how to provide first-class services that people expect with these property tax changes,\" Helmke said. \"For the city and the county, I think it means you\u2019re going to have to hike the income tax.\"\nIf local units in Hamilton County were to increase income taxes to the maximum rate, that would mean someone with a median county household income of just under $118,000 could pay an additional $1,800 in income taxes per year. Even just bumping the rate up to 1.4% \u2014 well beneath the limit allowed under law \u2014 would offset the max savings from the property tax credit.\n\"Since the (SB 1) tax cuts are the broadest and largest business tax cuts in state history,\" Hicks said, \"most local governments will need to maximize most of that income tax.\"\nJustin Ross, an IU economist specializing in state and local tax policy, said he would be surprised if most local governments don\u2019t tax near the maximum 2.9% rate in the next couple of years.\nOtherwise, they sacrifice amenities like ample parks, strong schools and robust police and fire departments that give cities and towns the edge in the competition for new residents.\n\"Local governments, for good or for bad, are the closest to being like a business,\" Ross said. \"Their property taxes are largely tied to their ability to make the place a desirable place to be.\"\nRepublican legislators aim to increase transparency by requiring local governments, starting in 2031, to vote annually on the income tax rates. Tax levies will no longer continue indefinitely but will be discussed and voted on during standalone public hearings.\n\"If local units of government choose to raise other taxes, like a local income tax,\" State Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, said in a statement, \"those units will have to justify to their taxpayers why they need more hard-earned taxpayer money instead of first looking to make their operations more efficient.\"\nHow local governments are reacting so far\nA consequence of local governments' shift from depending less on property taxes and more on income taxes will be greater difficulty forecasting revenues and planning long-term capital improvements, Accelerate Indiana Municipalities CEO Matt Greller told IndyStar.\n\"Property tax is very stable. You know what you're going to get for the most part. Every year, it doesn't fluctuate a whole lot,\" Greller said. \"Income taxes can fluctuate a lot more.\"\nUnder the new property tax law, Marion County is forecast to miss out on roughly $77 million in property taxes from 2026 to 2028 while Hamilton County forgoes $133 million, according to a state fiscal report.\nIn Marion County and statewide, schools are poised to face the largest losses.\nIn 2024, nearly half of the roughly $1.6 billion in property taxes collected in Marion County went to schools. The consolidated city-county government of Indianapolis and Marion County received a third of the taxes, about $513 million, that year. Smaller disbursements went to township trustees\u2019 offices, libraries, hospitals and public transit.\nMany local officials told IndyStar that the complexity of Indiana\u2019s property tax system means the looming changes are uncertain and require further analysis. But as towns and cities begin forming their 2026 budgets this summer, officials will act in anticipation of the millions of tax dollars they expect to miss out on in the coming years.\n\"The way we fund local government is shifting pretty significantly,\" Greller said, \"and there's going to be a whole lot of nuances in order to figure out what it looks like now.\"\nOfficials with the Indianapolis mayor\u2019s office and the Marion County assessor\u2019s office declined interviews on how the bill may reduce services in the state\u2019s largest city. The same was true of leaders in Carmel and Westfield. All said they are still analyzing how the bill will affect their cities.\nNoblesville Mayor Chris Jensen said extensive internal analyses show his city could receive about $36.5 million less than projected over the next four years. Those numbers far exceed Legislative Services Agency estimates \u2014 about $21 million for the city and school system combined \u2014 because the city is taking more factors into account than merely the tax credits, Jensen said.\nWith healthy cash reserves, the city is likely to manage the losses by pulling back on plans to boost its already \"very lean\" staffing levels, Jensen said. The lost revenue will also probably delay some of the 284 capital projects in Noblesville\u2019s 10-year plan. The mayor wasn't specific on which projects could be delayed, but Noblesville lists a number of road projects, such as improvements to State Road 37 and 38, as under design on its website.\n\"Even though we won't probably see the fiscal impact for another eight or so months until we get to 2026,\" Jensen said, \"we'll certainly be budgeting based on those fiscal impacts here in the next 90 days.\"\nDeb Whitfield, the Democratic mayor of Lawrence, said the law may benefit homeowners but places intense strain on local governments.\nLawrence city government could lose more than $1.2 million from 2026-2028, while the Lawrence school district stands to miss out on nearly $2.7 million. Starting this budget season, Whitfield said, she's intent on figuring out how to maintain high-quality public safety, schools and libraries with less money.\nWhitfield said that for her and her fellow mayors, there are \"going to be a lot of sleepless nights coming.\"\nEmail IndyStar Reporter Jordan Smith at JTsmith@gannett.com.

      "text": "New state law allots $50M for Indianapolis roads but can't be used for sidewalks, bike lanes\n- A state matching grant program could bring $100 million more a year to Indianapolis roads, but not to its sidewalks and bike paths.\n- The city's 8,400 lane miles are chronically underfunded because the state's road-funding formula allots the same amount to a two-lane road and a six-lane road.\n- The new law allows Indianapolis to triple certain taxes on vehicles to raise more revenue for roads.\nA new state law offers Indianapolis an additional $50 million in state funding each year to improve the city's battered roads. But the money, which could prove difficult to obtain, comes with strings attached that outlaw its use for increasingly popular traffic-calming changes like narrower streets, bike trails and sidewalks.\nUnder House Bill 1461, Indianapolis can access up to $50 million a year from the statewide Community Crossings grant program, starting in 2027. Signed into law by Indiana Gov. Mike Braun May 1, the bill also increases speed limits on Interstate 465 from 55 to 65 miles per hour, effective July 1, 2025, and offers other local governments tools to expand their road budgets.\nTo receive the money, Indianapolis must match any dollars the state provides, meaning the city could see up to $100 million more a year for roads by 2027. But an amendment by State Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, requires the city to match the state with new funding outside of its transportation and public safety budgets, a city spokesperson confirmed, which are two of the city's largest annual expenses.\nThe 2025 city-county budget was more than $1.6 billion, with nearly $1 billion devoted to public safety services including the Indianapolis police and fire departments, the Marion County sheriff's and prosecutor's offices, and Marion County courts. The city allotted nearly $200 million to roads, bridges and greenways in 2025.\nThe amendment also prevents Indianapolis from using the state's $50 million for five purposes: \"reducing the capacity of existing roads and streets; greenways; bike lanes; bike trails; and sidewalks.\"\nSome pedestrian advocates say that provision creates an incentive for the city to maintain larger roads instead of reducing lane counts, which could decrease maintenance costs and improve overall traffic safety.\nThe new state money won't solve Indy's pothole problem. A 2022 city-commissioned study found Indianapolis would need to spend more than $500 million a year to improve its roads to fair condition.\nRegardless, city leaders are praising this bill for giving Indianapolis a larger share of state dollars. Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett called the legislation \"the most significant new investment from the state of Indiana into Indianapolis road infrastructure in decades.\"\nThe city has 8,400 miles of pavement but currently receives state funding for only 3,400 \"center-lane\" road miles. That discrepancy stems from a road-funding formula that disregards lane counts, sending the same amount of money to a two-lane road in a rural county and a six-lane road in Indianapolis.\nCan the city match up to $50 million in state funding?\nCity officials will work in upcoming budgeting sessions to figure out how Indianapolis can shift money around to make the most of the state\u2019s contributions, Department of Public Works Director Todd Wilson said in a statement.\nThe legislation allows the city to raise money by tripling wheel taxes on large commercial vehicles and excise taxes on smaller personal vehicles, but city leaders have not signaled whether they intend to do so.\nThe bill raises the city\u2019s wheel tax limit from $80 to $240 and the excise tax limit from $50 to $150. Under the current limits, however, Indianapolis and Marion County still leave a combined $67 million in potential revenue on the table by charging less than the maximum allowed.\n\"I don\u2019t see the need for us to raise our wheel tax to come up with that $50 million when we have a $1.65 billion budget, probably going up to $1.7 (billion) this next year,\" Republican Indianapolis City-County Councilor Joshua Bain said during an April 17 public works meeting.\nDemocratic Councilor Jared Evans said that budgeting more money toward roads will be especially challenging because the city faces millions of dollars in lost property tax revenue after the passage of Senate Bill 1.\n\"While it\u2019s good for the roads, we also know we have some cuts coming due to the property tax bill,\" Evans said in the same meeting. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be an easy thing to achieve.\"\nIn a May 2 emailed statement, Indianapolis City-County Council President Vop Osili said he expects the city to benefit from the full $100 million available each year under the new law.\n\"For too long, limited funding has prevented us from addressing the full scope of our city\u2019s infrastructure needs,\" Osili said. \"With this additional support, more streets will be repaved, more neighborhoods will be revitalized, and more residents will experience a higher quality of life.\"\nWhy the money can't go toward \"road diets,\" bike lanes, sidewalks\nWhile a potential boon for motorists, pedestrian advocates criticize the law for limiting road improvements that enhance safety for all users. The city has redoubled its commitment to such changes in recent years with the Vision Zero plan to reduce traffic deaths and the 2022 overhaul of its Complete Streets ordinance, a policy requiring city planners to design streets with all travelers in mind.\nMany multi-lane roads in Indianapolis see less traffic since the advent of the interstates, local urban designer Jeffery Tompkins told IndyStar, yet the city is stuck with about 8,400 miles of pavement. Barring spending on \"road diets\" to remove lanes and add more bike paths and sidewalks, as the city will do south of downtown on the six-lane Madison Avenue, upholds a status quo that Indianapolis can\u2019t afford to maintain, Tompkins said.\n\"If I was a city leader with deferred maintenance of thousands of lane miles that I couldn't pay for,\" Tompkins said, \"I think that maybe it would be a better idea to get rid of some of those lane miles that aren\u2019t serving my population.\"\nAnthony Cherolis, executive director of Bike Indianapolis and the Central Indiana Bicycling Association, criticized Freeman in an emailed statement for \"state-level meddling in local design details\" that would enhance road safety for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists.\nFreeman did not respond to IndyStar\u2019s request for comment. In the 2024 legislative session, Freeman fought unsuccessfully to stall IndyGo's Blue Line bus route, arguing it shouldn't reduce lanes for car traffic on Washington Street.\nState Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, said he voted in favor of the bill despite Freeman's amendment because Indianapolis can\u2019t afford to miss out on $50 million in state money after decades of underfunding.\n\"I\u2019m excited for any piece of legislation that helps us address the backlog of roads and streets that need to be repaved and reconstructed, especially residential roads,\" Qaddoura told IndyStar.\nEmail IndyStar Reporter Jordan Smith at JTsmith@gannett.com.

      "text": "The Indiana House passed a complex property tax bill. Here are the biggest winners and losers\n(Correction: This story was updated to reflect that the 10% property tax credit is off of a homeowner's bill, not their assessed value.)\nThe Indiana House on Thursday passed its version of the signature property tax relief bill that has grown to also include reforms of local government finance.\nThe complex tax proposal in Senate Bill 1, which passed the House 65-29, would mean nearly 67% of Hoosiers pay less in property taxes in 2026 than they will this year, but it wouldn\u2019t have an equal impact on everyone due to changes to income tax calculations, and it could still hurt local governments.\nDemocrats on Thursday decried the bill as shifting the burden for Hoosiers from property taxes to local income taxes, with House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, calling the bill \u201ca bait and switch.\u201d At a press conference after the bill passed, House Democrats held red signs printed with white letters that read \u201cNo tax hikes for Hoosiers.\u201d\nBut the negative characterizations of the bill were enough to bring House Speaker Todd Huston down on the House floor to again advocate for Senate Bill 1.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what we are doing is we are providing taxpayer relief,\u201d Huston said.\nHere are the potential winners, losers and toss ups from SB 1.\nWinners\nSmall businesses\nThe current version of the bill will likely allow more business owners to be exempt from taxes on business equipment, such as computers or furniture, if they are purchased this year and beyond.\nCurrent law allows businesses to be exempt from equipment taxes if their total assets are valued at less than $80,000. SB 1 has lifted that number to $1 million in 2025 and $2 million in 2026.\n\u201cThe small mom and pops will be the ones that will qualify for this,\u201d said state Rep. Jeff Thompson, the House\u2019s chief budget writer.\nHoosier homeowners seeking immediate property tax relief\nSB 1 allows homeowners to take a property tax credit worth 10% of the property tax bill on their primary home, up to $300, off of their bills.\nThe U.S. Census puts the median value of an owner-occupied home in Indiana at just over $200,000. That means Hoosiers who own homes around that midpoint and who have already reached the property tax cap would be able to take that full 10% off their property tax bill next year, saving $200.\nStill, this version of the bill only reduces the tax burden for all homeowners by a collective $1.3 million over three years. Gov. Mike Braun's original property tax proposal would have saved more than three times that.\nHoosiers that only vote in general elections\nIf you\u2019re a Hoosier voter that only participates in general elections, SB 1 might help you make your voice heard when school districts or local governments ask taxpayers for more money for certain projects.\nWhile SB 1 has seen many changes since the start of the year, the requirement to put referendums and local public questions on general election ballots has been one of the few parts of the bill that has not changed.\nLawmakers have said it\u2019s an effort to get more participation when local governments and school corporations seek more money from their constituents. Sometimes referendums can land at other times of the year, when there might be less participation at the ballot box.\nSome senior citizens\nMore Hoosiers ages 65 and older will be able to take money off their property taxes due to changes in the bill to the eligibility requirements to receive credits.\nUnder SB 1, tens of thousands of additional seniors can take a maximum of $150 off their property taxes starting in 2026, in addition to the maximum $300 credit for all Hoosier homeowners across the state. The bill no longer puts limitations on access to those credits due to a senior's total assessed value of their home. It also raises the maximum salary cap for Hoosiers 65 and older to access the credits. A couple with a joint income of up to $70,000 would qualify under this bill. (Under current law, only those with a joint income of $40,000 or less qualify).\nFarmers\nIt's may not go as far as farmers wanted, but SB 1 changes a portion of how the state calculates the value of farm land, which could reduce assessed values by $280 per acre for the next two years, according to the bill's fiscal analysis.\nLosers\nIndiana school districts\nIndiana schools may face a challenging future under the new SB 1, between the property tax cuts, the lack of access to local income tax dollars and the addition of the controversial charter school property tax dollar sharing requirements of Senate Bill 518.\nIn total, schools across Indiana would lose around $744 million in property tax revenues over the next three years under the latest version of the bill. The school district that would lose the most under this plan is South Bend Community Schools, with $27 million lost over the three years.\nOut of the top 10 school districts that are at risk of losing the most from the latest version of the bill, eight are either Indianapolis area or local suburban school districts. Hamilton Southeastern Schools would see the second most loss with $26.7 million and Carmel-Clay Schools would see the third most loss at $25.2 million.\nNo school district in the state would gain any net property tax revenue over the next three years.\nIndiana local governments\nIndiana's cities, towns and counties will likely get hundreds of millions of dollars less in revenue over the next three years under SB 1 than they would under existing law, even as cities and towns might be able to turn to local income taxes to help boost revenues.\nOn a county level, some of Indiana's most populous counties are expected to miss out on the largest chunk of revenue starting as early as next year, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill. It's worth noting that their revenues are still largely expected to increase, just not as quickly as they would without this bill in place.\nIn 2026, Marion County is projected to miss out on more than $43 million. Hamilton County is estimated to miss out on more than $35 million and Lake County nearly $33 million next year.\n(Maybe) Renters\nThere are no tax credits or deductions for renters in SB 1, but renters might have to pay more in local income taxes if the city or town they live in chooses to establish its own local income tax rate to make up for the reduction in property tax collections.\nSB 1 allows a city or town with more than 3,500 residents to, for the first time, collect up to 1.2% in local income taxes. That means someone making $50,000 could pay up to an additional $600 per year. It\u2019s unclear at this point what cities and towns across the state might implement their own income tax, but renters would be chipping into those dollars without seeing the same benefits that homeowners receive in the bill.\n(Maybe) Hoosiers with high incomes and pricey homes\nHoosiers with high-value homes that likely see property tax bills of $3,000 or more still would only be able to claim a $300 tax credit. That means if someone lives in a city whose leaders decides to implement a local income tax, the added costs could outweigh the savings of the property tax relief. Again, it's unclear how many city leaders will take on the political risks associated with passing a tax increase.\nDisabled veterans\nWhile SB 1 provides disabled veterans with an additional $250 property tax credit that can be added on top of the credits for all Hoosier homeowners, the bill would expire significant deductions that disabled veterans currently have access to in state law. While House Republicans this week said more veterans might have access to the credit, some veterans are concerned about the historic deductions going away.\nCurrently, disabled veterans can take a $24,960 deduction off their assessed value if they meet certain eligibility requirements. Disabled veterans could also take another $14,000 off their tax liability if their home is valued under $200,000.\nNeutral\nFirst time homebuyers\nThere are no tax credits specifically set aside for first time homebuyers, in this version of the property tax relief bill. The version that passed the Senate in February did include a credit for first-time home buyers, but that was scrapped in House amendments this week.\nHouse Republicans also defeated a Democratic amendment that would have brought that proposal back into SB 1 and split funding for the credit between local governments and the state.\nBusinesses with big machinery\nFor maybe 48 hours this week, businesses with massive equipment costs seemed like they might come out on top in the version of SB 1 that was approved by a House committee on Monday.\nThat version of the bill included a phase out and eventual elimination of the state\u2019s business equipment tax, which was a deep concern for local governments that saw it as another difficult hit to their coffers. But the bill was amended on Wednesday to remove the future elimination of the business equipment tax.\nWhat's next for the proposal?\nThe bill will now return to the Senate for a final vote before it can go to Braun for consideration. With the bill author already signaling he's on board with the House's changes, the proposal could become law within a week.\nContact IndyStar state government and politics reporter Brittany Carloni at brittany.carloni@indystar.com.

  "argos_summary": "Indianapolis officials are requesting most department heads to cut their budgets by about 4% for 2026 due to anticipated property tax revenue losses from Senate Bill 1 and rising labor costs, which could lead to a $43 million budget deficit. While public safety agencies are exempt from these cuts, they are being asked to limit budget growth to 2%. Additionally, a new state program could provide up to $100 million annually for road improvements starting in 2027, although the funding cannot be used for sidewalks or bike lanes, highlighting ongoing challenges in infrastructure funding.",
