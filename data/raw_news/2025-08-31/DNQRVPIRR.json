  "description": "Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security se",
  "content": "Noem defends deployment of the National Guard in U.S. cities. Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, at a news conference in Washington in July. Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, defended the deployment of the National Guard in U.S. cities on Sunday, claiming that Los Angeles \u201cwouldn\u2019t be standing today\u201d if President Trump had not deployed troops there to help quiet protests over federal immigration crackdowns. Ms. Noem made the comments on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d as the host Ed O\u2019Keefe pressed her about upcoming plans to send federal forces into Chicago and other cities in Democratic-leaning states for law enforcement purposes. Mr. Trump on Monday directed the Defense Department to take a larger role in domestic law enforcement, including by \u201cquelling civil disturbances.\u201d The model for that move was the National Guard\u2019s deployment in Los Angeles, where troops were sent in June during protests in the city. Los Angeles \u201cwouldn\u2019t be standing today if President Trump hadn\u2019t taken action,\u201d Ms. Noem said. \u201cThat city would have burned down if left to the devices of the mayor and the governor of that state.\u201d She added that \u201cso many of those homes and businesses that were in downtown L.A. and those areas were dealing with violence and riots.\u201d The unrest in Los Angeles, which arose in response to Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps in the city, in some cases included fires and chunks of cement being thrown at officers. But it was mostly confined to a small area of the city. Mr. O\u2019Keefe asked Ms. Noem about comments made by Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, who has been a focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire. The president has repeatedly described Chicago as rife with crime and said publicly that Mr. Pritzker and others should ask the federal government to come in. Mr. Pritzker, who was one of 19 Democratic governors who signed a joint statement this week condemning the president\u2019s threat to send National Guard troops into major cities, said that Ms. Noem has been \u201cinflaming passions.\u201d He said that police officers in his state had made sure that no one was attacking ICE agents during their operations. But, he said, people also have a protected right to express themselves. In the interview, Ms. Noem blamed Mr. Pritzker for not calling President Trump and not looking for people to work with in the federal government.\n\nChicago\u2019s mayor rejects Trump\u2019s plans to send troops to his city. Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago has pushed back against the Trump administration\u2019s threats of militarized immigration enforcement in the city. Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago has rejected the Trump administration\u2019s plans to send troops or militarized federal agents to his city for immigration enforcement, and ordered local police officers not to aid the federal crackdown. The mayor\u2019s executive order, signed on Saturday, steps up the tensions between the White House and state and local officials. It comes after President Trump said he would send troops to Chicago and New York, as he did to Washington, D.C., in August and to Los Angeles in June. The mayor\u2019s order said the city would pursue \u201call available legal and legislative avenues\u201d to resist actions by the federal government \u201cthat violate the rights of the City and its residents, including the Constitutional rights to peacefully assemble and protest and the right to due process.\u201d \u201cFederal law prohibits the use of U.S. Military for domestic law enforcement except in extraordinary circumstances \u2014 which do not exist in Chicago,\u201d the order said. Crime in Chicago has fallen in nearly every major category over the past year, according to city figures, and murders are down 50 percent from their peak during the pandemic. At a news conference last week alongside other city and state leaders, Mayor Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, who are both Democrats, denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to send troops. But Mr. Trump repeated his threat in a social media post on Saturday, saying the governor needed to take action to prevent crime \u201cor we\u2019re coming!\u201d Mr. Johnson\u2019s executive order said that federal agents should comply with city policies that prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing masks to intentionally disguise or conceal their identities. It also calls for the city to take steps to ensure that residents know their rights when encountering federal agents. \u201cWe have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some type of militarized activity by the federal government,\u201d Mr. Johnson told reporters on Saturday. \u201cWe have not called for this.\u201d Chicago has clashed with the Trump administration over the city\u2019s sanctuary laws for immigrants. Illinois and Chicago limit how city agencies may interact with federal immigration authorities; the White House says that a lack of cooperation at the local and state levels impedes federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nMore than 2,200 member of the National Guard have been deployed in Washington. Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney in Washington, on Sunday defended the Trump administration\u2019s takeover of the city\u2019s police force and the deployment of more than 2,200 members of the National Guard to the capital. Speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Ms. Pirro said that since the federal deployment began in early August, the authorities had made 1,528 arrests and seized 156 guns. \u201cThey can\u2019t be used to shoot and kill other people,\u201d she said of the confiscated weapons. But a review by The New York Times of about a thousand arrests that were made during the first two weeks of the federal law enforcement surge suggests that the operation has been more of a sprawling dragnet than a targeted crime-fighting operation. Ms. Pirro also sought to deflect criticism over a case in which federal prosecutors were unable to persuade a grand jury to approve a felony indictment against a man who threw a sandwich at a federal agent on the streets of Washington this month. The grand jury\u2019s rejection of the felony charge was a remarkable failure by Ms. Pirro\u2019s office and the second time in recent days that a majority of grand jurors refused to vote to indict a person accused of felony assault on a federal agent. \u201cA lot of those people who sit on juries live in Georgetown or in Northwest or in some of these better areas, and they don\u2019t see the reality of crime that is occurring,\u201d Ms. Pirro said. \u201cThe grand jurors don\u2019t take it so seriously.\u201d\n\nA U.S. Air Force plane that was used to deport migrants in Guatemala City in January. Daniele Volpe for The New York Times A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Guatemalan children back to their home country, and scheduled an emergency hearing on Sunday afternoon to determine whether deporting them would be legal. Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued the order after the National Immigration Law Center filed an emergency request in federal court to stop the deportations. The lawyers argued that the government had violated the children\u2019s rights to due process and had ignored special protections for minors who cross the border alone. The court forbade the administration from deporting the children, who are as young as 10, for 14 days. Even so, dozens of children were removed by immigration authorities from shelters overnight and were gathered in preparation to be placed on chartered planes to Guatemala, according to officials with knowledge of the situation. The judge\u2019s order could temporarily hamstring the federal government\u2019s attempts to return to Guatemala hundreds of unaccompanied minors who have been in U.S. custody after crossing the southern border. On Sunday morning, after the temporary restraining order was issued, shelters holding children received a letter from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement stating that the agency was responsible for the care and custody of the children, and that the shelters must comply with the agency\u2019s directives. The officials with knowledge of the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution from the government, said that dozens of children were removed from shelters in the early morning hours Sunday. Though the judge\u2019s order is temporary, it is the second recent setback for President Trump\u2019s immigration policies. On Friday, another judge blocked the administration from carrying out rapid deportations far from the border, a cornerstone of the White House\u2019s immigration policy. The lawsuit over the Guatemalan children was filed after staff members at shelters that were holding the children were notified by email on Saturday that they should prepare some of them to be sent back to Guatemala. Lawyers representing some of the children received a similar email. In its 25-page complaint, the National Immigration Law Center said that the children had active cases before immigration courts across the country, and that their repatriation would violate federal law and the Constitution. It called the government\u2019s actions \u201cunlawful and reckless.\u201d Ten children are identified by their initials in the lawsuit. All of them have cases pending in immigration courts and have told judges that they are afraid to return to Guatemala, the lawsuit says. The number of unaccompanied minors entering the United States has plummeted since Mr. Trump began his second term. Migrant children have posed a particular challenge to the Trump administration because they are entitled to special protections. Hundreds of thousands of children, mainly from Central America, have crossed the southern border into the United States in the last decade, often seeking to join friends or relatives. Many of the minors have won the right to remain in the United States permanently by proving that they were abandoned or persecuted in their home countries. The move to repatriate the Guatemalan children has the backing of the Guatemalan government. Carlos Ram\u00edro Mart\u00ednez, Guatemala\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, said on Friday that his country had been coordinating with the United States. and expected to receive more than 600 minors. When unaccompanied children entering the United States are taken into custody, they typically remain in shelters until they are released to sponsors or guardians once those adults have been vetted. The children the Trump administration is seeking to deport have been awaiting release from the shelters. Lawyers fighting the removal of unaccompanied minors have cited the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which provides special protections for unaccompanied minors who seek refuge in the United States, including the opportunity to have their cases adjudicated by a court. \u201cWe are very concerned that our clients could be returned to unsafe situations,\u201d said Ms. Sendukas, managing attorney with the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project.\n\nTrump says he will sign an executive order mandating voter I.D. for elections. President Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he would sign an executive order mandating voter ID. Karsten Moran for The New York Times President Trump said late Saturday that he would issue an executive order to require voter identification for all U.S. elections, a continuation of his efforts to overhaul the nation\u2019s election laws, which he has long attacked and falsely blamed for his 2020 election loss. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said, \u201cVoter I.D. Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!!\u201d He did not provide further details about the order. He also reiterated his intention to restrict mail-in voting except for those who are very ill or serving far away in the military, as well as his opposition to voting machines. The announcement signals Mr. Trump\u2019s latest effort to influence election laws using an executive order, something that he has dubious authority to do. The Constitution gives the president no explicit authority to regulate elections. Rather, it gives states the power to decide the rules of elections, oversee voting and try to prevent fraud. It gives Congress the ability to override state laws on voting. Any executive order from the president regarding elections is likely to see immediate legal challenges. Mr. Trump and his allies have started a wide-ranging effort to gain any advance they can ahead of midterm elections, which are set for November 2026. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump said that a team of lawyers were preparing an executive order to end all mail-in ballots and wrote on social media that the executive order would \u201chelp bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.\u201d He has long opposed mail-in voting and falsely claimed it was a source of fraud after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joseph R. Biden Jr. In March, Mr. Trump signed an executive order seeking to require people to show government-issued proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. The order was swiftly challenged in court, and a federal judge blocked the vast majority of the order in June. The judge, Denise J. Casper of the Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts, sided with states that had sued to stop the requirements, writing in her judgment that the states were likely to succeed in showing that the order exceeded Mr. Trump\u2019s authority and risked disenfranchising some of the electorate. Judge Casper was appointed by President Obama. \u201cThe Constitution does not grant the president any specific powers over elections,\u201d she wrote.\n\nFrom Cracker Barrel to Sydney Sweeney, Trump has an opinion to share. Mr. Trump at the Kennedy Center earlier this month. Cracker Barrel didn\u2019t ask for this. Just a couple weeks ago, it was a restaurant where patrons could play checkers and eat Chicken n\u2019 Dumplins. That changed when the chain removed an image of a man sitting next to a barrel from its logo. The restaurant endured cultural backlash from conservatives, including President Trump\u2019s eldest son, who accused the company\u2019s executives of supporting diversity efforts. After a call with White House officials and a logo change earlier this week, the company unwoked itself to Mr. Trump\u2019s liking. \u201cCongratulations Cracker Barrel!\u201d read the statement from Mr. Trump, who celebrated the old barrel man\u2019s return to the logo. \u201cAll of your fans very much appreciate it.\u201d It used to be that you could switch off the so-called culture wars, or at least find a place to mute them for a little while. Cracker Barrel was actually one of those places. But now, not even something as low stakes as a company\u2019s logo can escape the gaze of a president bent on changing \u2014 or forcing \u2014 American life to reflect his own views and tastes, which often mirror the far-right ideological movement that fueled his rise. The White House declined to comment on why this matter was worthy of the president\u2019s time, and why officials had held the call with Cracker Barrel. But an official passed on a statement from Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, who praised the president\u2019s \u201cunmatched business instincts.\u201d The logo debacle seems like a small thing, but really, it shows how Mr. Trump is now using his power to reshape all aspects of American culture, not just American policy. He has not hesitated to retaliate against those who disagree. A Cracker Barrel restaurant in Binghamton, N.Y., whose sign shows the chain restaurant\u2019s original logo. He has effectively taken over the Kennedy Center, where he will decide what art is appropriate to receive national recognition, and where he will host the annual awards ceremony. (No \u201cwokesters,\u201d he said of the recipients.) He is reviewing Smithsonian museums and exhibits \u201cto assess tone, historical framing and alignment with American ideals.\u201d He issued an executive order requiring that all future federal buildings eschew modernist architecture. He called in the National Guard to control Washington\u2019s crime, and now its members, some with little to do, are spreading mulch in parks downtown. He has returned to earlier threats to investigate or exert control over television networks. After crowing over the cancellation of \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d whose host is an ardent critic, Mr. Trump vowed to investigate NBC over extending the contract of the late-night host Seth Meyers. (His contract was extended before Mr. Trump took office for the second time.) Golf buddies have also been given the benefit of the presidential bullhorn. Mr. Trump has demanded that Roger Clemens, the former major-league pitcher whose career was overshadowed by steroid suspicions, be elected to the Hall of Fame, \u201cNOW.\u201d (Mr. Clemens played golf with the president recently.) Turn off the television and he\u2019ll turn up at your college football game talking about transgender people in sports. Try to do some doomscrolling on Instagram and there\u2019s Sydney Sweeney, she of the \u201cGood jeans\u201d American Eagle ad. Mr. Trump proudly claimed recently that she is a registered Republican with the \u201cHOTTEST\u201d commercial going. Mute social media and he\u2019ll be onstage at the Kennedy Center, praising the physique of Sylvester Stallone. Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard who studies authoritarianism and threats to democracies, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s impulses have led to unprecedented attacks on American institutions, and that the early months of his term appear to have emboldened him. \u201cWe have a lot of muscle in American society,\u201d Mr. Levitsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very wealthy society and a lot of highly skilled lawyers, and it is well organized. The United States has the raw materials to push back. It\u2019s just not doing it.\u201d Mr. Levitsky predicted that Americans might be finding the cultural overreach into their homes and televisions and social media accounts \u201cannoying.\u201d But he said there was little to stop the president from continuing his disruptive cultural campaign. Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms and demands have evolved since he was a pop culture obsessive who lived on Twitter to comment on the news of the day. When he entered the White House, he used the presidential bully pulpit to attack a dizzying range of critics, from celebrities to former members of his first presidential administration. In some cases, the line between his political opponents living under mere threat of retaliation and those actually facing it is growing thinner. A number of former Trump administration officials whom Mr. Trump has considered insufficiently loyal have had their Secret Service details pulled, including Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state, and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the former government scientist. They are part of a growing list of Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, who\u2019ve also had their details revoked. A number of other perceived enemies of Mr. Trump are facing investigations, including Lisa Cook, a Fed governor the president has accused of mortgage fraud. (She has not been charged with a crime.) Others have been threatened without evidence, including former President Barack Obama, whom Mr. Trump has accused of undermining his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Obama\u2019s office called those claims a \u201cweak attempt at distraction.\u201d Even his old pop-culture Twitter foils have faced increasingly dark threats. Rosie O\u2019Donnell, a longtime and very vocal Trump critic, is now living in Ireland. Mr. Trump has mused about revoking her American citizenship, which is unconstitutional. One former target who got off relatively easy was Taylor Swift, the pop star who recently announced her engagement to Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs. Ms. Swift did not endorse Mr. Trump, and he has attacked her before. This week, in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Mr. Trump magnanimously offered her good luck with her engagement. But not before pointedly wishing Mr. Kelce good luck.",

      "text": "Noem defends deployment of the National Guard in U.S. cities.\nKristi Noem, the Homeland Security se\nBy Maggie Haberman\nI covered the 2024 presidential campaign, down ballot races, and the investigations into former President Donald J. Trump. Now I am covering his second term as president after his election win.\nI\u2019m a New York City native and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. My first reporting job was at the New York Post, where I started working as a clerk in 1996, followed by the New York Daily News and Politico, before joining The Times as a campaign reporter in 2015. I have covered five presidential elections, several governors\u2019 races and New York City mayoral races. I covered Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s second term at City Hall in New York, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2000 U.S. senate race, both of President Obama\u2019s national campaigns, and the rebuilding at the World Trade Center site, among other topics.\nI am also the author of \u201cConfidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America.\u201d\nI was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for reporting on President Trump\u2019s advisers and their connections to Russia.

      "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s wobbly walk is in the spotlight again, with a video appearing to show the president struggling to move his legs with any fluidity.\nThe 79-year-old played golf with former Major League Baseball pitcher Roger Clemens and his son Kacy at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia on Saturday. A new bruise was spotted on his left hand after Kacy posted a video on Instagram, stoking concerns about the president\u2019s health in the wake of another furor about the president\u2019s cankles.\nThe video, which Kacy titled \u201cA Day On the Course With the President,\u201d features a compilation of clips from the Clemens\u2019 Saturday golf outing, with footage of the group driving their golf carts, hitting the links, and walking between holes. At one point, Trump is seen walking alongside Roger with apparent difficulty, as he appears to drag his right leg behind him as he moves.\n\u201cHe\u2019s dragging that right leg again, and he can\u2019t walk in a straight line,\u201d Ben Meiselas of MeidasTouch said, reviewing the video.\nTrump heads toward a set of steps, before the video cuts to a shot of him already at the bottom. The post, which Kacy captioned \u201cIncredible day at Trump National Washington DC with The President, Donald Trump!,\u201d was set to the song \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down\u201d by Tom Petty. In 2020, Petty\u2019s family issued an official cease-and-desist letter to the Trump campaign after the late singer\u2019s track was used at a rally.\nClemens\u2019 social media post is the second time this month that Trump\u2019s unsteady walk has been in the spotlight, after first making headlines following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15.\nThe president was seen veering from left to right as he walked on a red carpet rolled out for the Kremlin dictator, unable to stay in its center, before reaching a set meeting point.\nThe footage also comes as bruises on Trump\u2019s hands repeatedly generate headlines. \u201cPresident Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast in a statement after she was quizzed about the new bruise.\nLeavitt first offered up the hand-shaking explanation back when the bruising was first spotted in February. Trump\u2019s physician, Sean Barbabella, later expanded on Leavitt\u2019s comment, explaining that the bruising \u201cis consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.\u201d\nThe hand-shaking explanation has regularly been rolled out when Trump\u2019s recurring bruising pops up on his right hand. The new mark, however, is on his left hand.\nAs has become the usual, Trump\u2019s right hand was coated in makeup during Saturday\u2019s golf outing. According to a game scorecard shared by Roger, Trump finished fourth out of four\u2014a result that might have also bruised his ego.\n\u201cPresident Trump is the most active and transparent president in American history,\u201d White House spokesperson Liz Huston told the Daily Beast.\nMeanwhile, Joe Biden\u2019s handlers covered up his mental decline for four years while they did everything in their power to destroy America.\""
