      "summary": "Ars Technica’s analysis shows that recent video game consoles are priced significantly higher than historic trends would predict, with Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo all raising U.S. prices for their current lineups. Sony announced $50 increases for all PS5 models, Microsoft lifted Xbox Series X and S prices in March, and Nintendo has adjusted Switch 2 accessories amid tariff concerns. The article highlights that unlike past consoles, which saw steep price drops within a few years, modern consoles remain near launch prices, defying expectations even after inflation adjustments.",
