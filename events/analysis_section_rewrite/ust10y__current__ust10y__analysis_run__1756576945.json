      "feedback": "Your draft is on the right track but still needs to meet Argos’ strict evidence, mapping, and action‑oriented standards. 1) **Add explicit canonical mapping**: every claim about the 10‑year yield must reference the handle `ust10y` (e.g., “UST 10‑year (ust10y) is poised to trade around 4.23 %”). 2) **Cite every numeric claim**: attach inline IDs (97MD1FHW8 for core PCE, 1DEM6P1Y2 for tariff window, 3YAQ8JUPL for tech‑stock risk). 3) **Quantify the range and direction**: state “UST 10‑year likely to stay 4.20–4.30 % over the next 0–3 weeks; a 10‑bp move up or down is plausible.” 4) **Define catalysts with dates**: “mid‑September core PCE release (≈ Sept 15) and the tariff policy expiry (mid‑Oct) are the primary windows.” 5) **State invalidation scenarios**: “If core PCE > 2.6 % or tariffs trigger a headline inflation spike, the 10‑year will likely rise > 10 bp, invalidating the dovish bias.” 6) **Add cross‑asset links**: mention how a 10‑bp rise in the 10‑year compresses the 2‑year spread, tightening the term premium, and how equity indices (spx, ndx) and VIX (vix) move in tandem. 7) **Actionable recommendation**: “Short the 10‑year if core PCE > 2.6 % or if the 2‑year yield stops falling; otherwise, hold or long if the 2‑year continues to decline and core PCE stays ≤ 2.6 %.” 8) **Remove any vague language** (e.g., “could increase risk‑aversion”) and replace with concrete thresholds or probabilities. 9) **Ensure each sentence can be traced back to a source**; if not, delete or rewrite. 10) **Keep the paragraph concise** (≤ 200 words) while preserving all the above details.",
