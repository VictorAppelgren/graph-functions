  "description": "The General Lee is the star of The Dukes of Hazzard. It has always been a B-body Dodge Charger, powered by various Chrysler engines, and featuring various mods.",
  "content": "Throughout the history of television and film, cars have played an important role. While the majority of silver screen featured cars are quickly forgotten, a handful of them become just as famous as the film stars that pilot them. Just think about the Aston Martin DB5 of the \"James Bond\" franchise, or Steve McQueen's iconic \"Bullitt\" Mustang.\n\nAnother legend of the screen is the General Lee \u2014 a bright orange B-body Dodge Charger which featured heavily throughout \"The Dukes of Hazzard\". The show itself was a huge success, running from 1979 through to 1985. At the time, the American muscle car was very much in hiding, thanks largely to the oil crisis of 1973, so it makes sense the production company went back in time and sourced a classic muscle car, as this would've had much more grunt than contemporary offerings.\n\nThroughout the show, hundreds of Dodge Charger models were used \u2013 both 1968 and 1969 models \u2013 with the show getting through a rough average of one car per episode. This was predominantly due to the wild stunts featured within \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" which would render many a Dodge quickly unfit for purpose.\n\nFor scenes filmed with Bo and Luke Duke at the wheel, the Charger would be powered by a 375 horsepower 440ci V8, but other engines were used as well. Some would be powered by a smaller 383ci V8 motor, while at least one 318ci V8-powered model was used, as it would be lighter, and therefore ideal for a daring two-wheel stunt.",

      "text": "6 Facts About Steve McQueen's Iconic 1968 Bullitt Mustang\nA well-documented lover of racing in all its forms, actor Steve McQueen might have been a professional racer in another life. \"I'm not sure whether I'm an actor who races or a racer who acts,\" the smoldering symbol of the '60s and '70s once said. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle.\nEven while working as an actor, McQueen appeared in several races under the amusing pseudonym Harvey Mushman. And he was no dilletante. He piloted a $4-million Porsche to second place in the 1970 12 Hours of Sebring \u2014 while recovering from a broken foot sustained in a motocross race two weeks prior. And it took until the last lap for a Ferrari driven by Mario Andretti to overtake him.\nIt's only fitting that McQueen's memory should go hand-in-hand with one of the most legendary cars ever to grace the silver screen. Promoting a vehicle via a film has been standard for decades, but few examples are as memorable as McQueen's 1968 turn as police Lt. Frank Bullitt, during which he hurled a Mustang around the streets of San Francisco.\nMaybe there was something magical about seeing the actor-cum-racer combine his passions into one glorious orgy of smoking rubber and power slides. The car chase became so iconic that it overshadowed an otherwise forgettable film and created a new Hollywood automotive legend: the Bullitt Mustang. Join us as we look into the car that birthed a million Ford fans and the truth about its fate.\nThe Bullitt Mustang was a promotional vehicle\nThe Ford Mustang had changed the landscape of American performance cars a mere handful of years before the filming of \"Bullitt.\" The pony car's release in April of 1964 sparked a previously unknown desire for lightweight American coupes with big V8s.\nWhen \"Bullitt\" began filming in February 1968, Ford faced stiff competition from General Motors. The generational refresh the Mustang received in 1967 was small potatoes compared to the introduction of the all-new Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird. Ford needed to steal some of the limelight back. What better way than to have an authentic racer and leading man whip a Mustang up and down the streets of San Francisco in an epic car chase on movie screens nationwide?\nThe promotional ploy worked better than anyone imagined. McQueen and the 1968 Mustang became so iconic that the car community immediately dubbed the 1968 Mustang Fastback the \"'Bullitt Mustang\" and promptly forgot about the rest of the film.\nIt's hard to say, but fun to imagine how much the Mustang contributed to the success of the ca- chase scene that made it a legend. Would it have made such a huge splash in the psyches of car nuts if Bullitt had piloted a Plymouth Road Runner or Porsche 911? The point is moot because Ford wanted a promotional vehicle, and boy, did it ever get one.\nThe Bullitt Mustang was a 1968 GT Fastback 390\nHow did the Bullitt Mustang come to be? After deciding to use a Mustang as Frank Bullitt's vehicle, Warner Bros. ordered a pair of Mustang Fastbacks from Ford. The studio chose the 1968 GT as the base car, then applied some changes to turn it into an on-screen machine.\nThe GT package automatically included power disc brakes, whitewall nylon tires, and an upgraded cooling package. Buyers could choose between a two- or four-barrel carburetor mounted on the 390-cubic-inch engine. Depending on the setup, the GT could make between 270 and 325 horsepower in its stock version.\nThe studio added a weathered patina to the signature Dark Highland Green paint even though these were new cars. After applying some scuff to the paint and painting the gas caps black, the Bullitts took on an understated, quasi-menacing appearance suitable to Frank Bullitt's demeanor.\nMax Balchowsky, a stuntman and race driver who worked for the studio, modified the Mustangs mechanically with an aftermarket four-speed manual transmission and clutch, and added crossbeam stabilizers in addition to multiple reinforcements to the frame and springs that would help the cars absorb the abuse of the chase scenes. With their mechanical and aesthetic modifications, the Bullitt Mustangs struck a chord with the public \u2014 and additionally, there was the cachet of Steve McQueen in the driver's seat.\n[Featured image by Sicnag via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY 2.0]\nThe car-chase scene that broke the Hollywood mold\nThe cool factor of Max Balchowsky's modifications played a significant role, but the car chase scene itself helped form the Bullitt Mustang's lasting reputation. In the film, Frank Bullitt hops in his Mustang to chase down a bad guy driving a 1968 Dodge Charger R/T.\nThe ensuing pursuit takes up nearly 11 minutes of screen time in a film less than two hours long. Not only was it one of the longest chase scenes in a movie to date, it was uniquely riveting because of the production's insistence on realism. This included setting up the chase on city streets in San Francisco, including interior points-of-view then underutilized in cinema (some viewers were said to experience motion sickness), and sound design lifted from both recording racing engines and McQueen shifting gears with recording equipment in the cockpit.\nThe scene starts slowly, building tension for the first minute or two as McQueen subtly tails the Charger through the streets. But around minute three, the baddies in the Charger (with legendary driver Bill Hickman at the wheel) fasten their seatbelts \u2014 lap only \u2014 and it's on. The screeching tires, realistic traffic, and San Francisco scenery make great fodder for a muscle-car chase.\nMcQueen insisted that the Mustang's windows be open so that moviegoers could see that he was driving. However, McQueen did not pilot the Mustang for the entire chase. He had help from driver Bud Ekins on the more dangerous stunts.\nOne of the two originals found a second life as a teacher's commuter car\nWith only two authentic Bullitt Mustangs ever made, the car's rarity and impact on the culture should have marked it as a valuable collector's item. Today, it would likely be packed up and auctioned off as a piece of mechanical Americana \u2014 not so in the '60s.\nOne original was essentially destroyed in filming and sent to a salvage yard (we'll return to that in a moment), while the production sold the other. The Road & Track classified for the surviving model advertised the \"Bullett\" Mustang driven by Steve McQueen in mint condition. The price? Best offer.\nBob Kiernan purchased the GT for $6,000 in 1974 and, incredibly, his wife, Robbie, drove it daily to the school where she taught third grade while Bob commuted to his New York City insurance job via train. When Bob's son Sean inherited the most legendary lost car in film history in 2015, it had undergone just a few changes: new carpets and steering wheel, a replaced bumper, and an engine rebuild. For all intents and purposes, it was original right down to the deliberately scuffed Highland Green paint job.\nAfter a detailed verification, the Kiernans' family heirloom proved to be the genuine article. Fans flocked to the 2018 Detroit Auto Show to behold the coming-out of a legend 50 years in the making. In 2020, the Kiernans parted with their heirloom when it sold for $3.74 million at auction.\nThe other original absconded to Mexico\nWith the Kiernan family keeping their possession of the Bullitt Mustang close to their chest, it had seemed like the originals were gone \u2014 until car-restoration guru Kevin Marti got a phone call in 2017 at his Phoenix-based Ford specialty shop. The caller \u2014 a custom-Mustang builder named Ralph Garcia Jr. \u2014 wanted to build a clone of the Eleanor Mustang from the \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" film, and hoped Marti could provide him with a report matching the potential restoration's serial number so he could determine the car's original factory setup.\nMarti recognized the serial number \u2014 he had memorized it. After asking his caller if he had the car in hand, he kindly informed him about what he was sitting on and recommended Garcia have an expert look it over before he did anything to it. Garcia asked Marti, who promptly booked a ticket for Mexicali, Mexico.\nThe car was in rough shape because of the impacts from jumps and the general abuse heaped upon it while filming. The busted Mustang even had the old camera mounts attached, but it lacked the drivetrain and interior, and had been painted over more than once. Still, Marti was able to confirm it via that vehicle identification number.\nOnce Marti confirmed that it was the real deal, Garcia's plans suddenly changed. What was going to be an Eleanor clone for an American customer suddenly turned into the restoration opportunity of a lifetime.\nSteve McQueen wanted the car back\nSteve McQueen died at age 50 in 1980, but only after he tried to buy the Bullitt Mustang from the Kiernan family. They may have worked hard to keep their secret, but McQueen somehow tracked down the car he had made famous.\nIn a tersely worded letter sent in 1977, McQueen appealed to Bob Kiernan to sell him the Mustang, telling him that the Mustang was \"simply personal with me,\" and that he would like to keep it in unrestored condition. He even offered to find Kiernan a replacement, \"... if there is not too much monies [sic] involved in it. Otherwise, we had better forget it.\" It's a strong sales pitch if we've ever heard one.\nKiernan resisted McQueen's charmless offer, but he kept the letter, which came to light along with the car when the Kiernans revealed it in 2018. McQueen died just three years after sending his final appeal, without adding the Bullitt Mustang to his impressive, expensive car collection."

      "text": "7 Must-Know Facts About Bond's Aston Martin DB5 From Goldfinger\nFew heroes get by on skill and good luck alone; some fancy gear and a fly ride go a long way. Batman has the Batmobile, Wonder Woman has her invisible jet, and even the Ninja Turtles take the fight to the Shredder in a van that Donatello somehow pieced together in their sewer lair. It's a fact: Any self-respecting action icon needs a distinctive ride to chase down or escape from the bad guys.\nAs iconic as some of these combinations are, few figures in big-screen action are more closely associated with their ride than James Bond. Few imagined that the fictional superspy's debut in 1962's Dr. No would lead to more than sixty years of iconic silver-screen action.\nBond pilots a Sunbeam Alpine in the original film, while in the following release, From Russia With Love, Q Branch equips him with an elegant but somewhat stodgy 1935 Bentley. Bond has wreaked havoc from behind the wheel (or yoke, or handlebars) of many vehicles over his impossibly long and destructive career, but one vehicle is linked to Bond above all others: the Aston Martin DB5.\nSuave, stylish, and as quintessentially British as 007 himself, Aston Martins have made several appearances in the film canon. Bond has racked up miles in a V8 Vantage, V12 Vanquish, DB10, and a handful of DBS models. They have all struck a chord, but none has proven to have the staying power of the DB5. Decades after its debut, the 1965 Aston Martin DB5 became one of the top five most expensive Aston Martins ever sold at auction.\nJoin us as we review the must-know facts about Bond's Aston Martin DB5, the car that started it all.\nThe Goldfinger DB5 is the first Aston Martin in a Bond film\nThe Bond universe can get confusing. With Fleming writing a dozen novels beginning in 1953, a film franchise spanning six decades that kicked off in 1962, and a massive array of content in the intervening years, parsing the chronology can be tough. Just know that despite being the sixth novel, Goldfinger was the third film, and it debuted Aston Martin as Bond's primary ride.\nGoldfinger sees Bond facing off against Auric Goldfinger, a gold dealer who uses gold to murder people to meet his goal of stealing... gold. Okay, it's not exactly subtle symbolism, but it's fun, and it features the absolutely bizarre yet iconic bowler-hurling Oddjob as the primary henchman, not to mention the debut of Bond's DB5.\nFans get their first glimpse of the Aston Martin when Q introduces Bond to his gear. Bond inquires about his Bentley, but Q assures him his Bentley days are over as he leads Bond across the lab to a DB5 painted in Silver Birch. Q details his modifications to the DB5, including bulletproofing, revolving license plates, a homing device, smokescreens, machine guns, and an ejection seat.\nNo word on how the extra weight impacted the car's performance, but Bond makes full use of the gizmos and gadgets in a later chase scene. By today's standards, the chase is positively sedate, but it firmly cements the Aston Martin as the Bond car of the future.\nThe original Goldfinger car disappeared for 25 years\nMost movie productions can't get away with keeping a single model of a film car, but one DB5 rises above the rest as the true original Bond car. Goldfinger required two Aston Martin DB5s.\nOne, with the chassis number DB5/1486/R, was the \"road car.\" It lacked the specialized props to make it a Q car and was used for standard driving sequences (though it was later equipped with the gizmos to meet promotional demands).\nThe other, a 1963 Aston Martin DB5 with chassis number DP216/1, received the full suite of Bond's unique gadgets. After filming wrapped on 1965's Thunderball, EON Productions returned DP216/1 to Aston Martin, as Bond switched to a Toyota 2000GT for You Only Live Twice. Aston stripped the special equipment and sold the to collector Gavin Keyzar.\nKeyzar returned it to form before selling it to Richard Losee, who ultimately auctioned it off for a cool quarter million to memorabilia collector and mogul Anthony Pugliese III in 1986. It sat in the Pugliese collection alongside Indiana Jones' whip and Superman's cape until June 18, 1997, when it disappeared. Pugliese's insurance paid out $4.2 million.\nThe car's fate remained a mystery for 25 years until it suddenly resurfaced. An anonymous tip led to verification that DP216/1 was in private hands somewhere in the Middle East. The ultimate fate of the car remains murky; the law dictates that those who buy stolen goods in good faith may have a claim to those goods.\nThe man behind Bond's Goldfinger DB5 built some of your favorite movie gadgets\nJohn Stears may have been the closest thing to a real-life Q the franchise ever got. As the master special effects practitioner, he was in charge of turning the gorgeous yet underarmed DB5 into a weapon worthy of the world's greatest superspy.\nAlthough Bond's car in the book was the DB Mark III, EON Productions improbably convinced Aston Martin to let it use the prototype DB5 for the film. Stears promptly brainstormed a number of upgrades appropriate to Bond. When he took the ideas to Aston, he was informed it was impossible. Stears went back to the studio and promptly began modifying the prototype.\nStears' additions include:\n- .30-caliber Browning machine guns\n- Tire-slashing extensions a la Grease\n- Radio telephone (high-tech, indeed)\n- Homing radar scanner\n- Bulletproof windscreen\n- Retractable bulletproof shield\n- Revolving licensed plates\n- Smoke machine to obscure getaways\n-\nOil slick ejector and spiked caltrops\nBond puts most of the devices to good use in the film, kickstarting a long tradition of silver screen Aston Martins that are more than they appear.\nStears passed away in 1999, but not before creating some of Hollywood's most epic special effects props, including Luke Skywalker's land speeder, a number of light sabers, the flying Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car, and even designing the beloved R2-D2.\n[Featured image by Dcs57 via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY-SA 4.0]\nBond's car could have been a Jaguar 3.4\nIan Fleming, the author of the Bond novels, was something of a Bond-like character himself. A former British intelligence operative during the Second World War, he retired to Jamaica after the war to write. Drawing inspiration from his wartime experiences, he created the superspy we have all come to know and love.\nWhen he wrote the seventh Bond novel, Goldfinger, in 1959, he presented Bond with a choice: Would he prefer a Jaguar or an Aston Martin? This decision was not just about cars; it was about shaping the image of a superspy. Both were British icons that would suit Bond's cover as a young, adventurous playboy.\nThe Jaguar 3.4 offered to Bond in the novel was in production from 1955 to 1959. The 3.4 designation indicated the displacement of the 3,442 cc in-line six-cylinder under the hood (er... bonnet). It could hit 120 mph and knock out a zero-to-60 mph time of 11.2 seconds. It was not earth-shattering by today's standards, but that was before Q Branch got ahold of it. Not that it ever would. Bond chose the Aston.\nThough a timeless beauty by any standard, a young secret agent might identify the Jag's bulbous curves as belonging to a previous generation. It looked more suited to a gentlemanly drive on the estate than a running gunfight. Whatever the reason, book Bond chose Aston Martin, thus beginning a relationship that would last decades.\n[Featured image by SG2012 via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY 2.0]\nBond drove a DB Mark III in the novel version of Goldfinger, but got the new DB5 in the film\nBond chose Aston Martin in the book, but it was not a DB5. Rumored to be a fan's suggestion, the Aston Martin in the novel was a DB Mark III. It appears significantly more Bond-like than the Jag, but that could be decades of marketing at work.\nIntroduced to the world in 1957 at the Geneva Motor Show, the Mark III came with the first iteration of the Aston Martin grill as designed by Bert Thickpenny, whose name belongs in a Bond movie. Powered by one of the last twin-cam six-cylinders built by luxury car builder Lagonda, the 2.9L engine put out 164 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque. Its power specs might not be mind-blowing, but it could hit 120 mph at a stretch and included a smooth and fashionable design just right for Bond. Even so, Bond was earmarked for something newer and better by the time Goldfinger went into production.\nAston Martin debuted the DB5 at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September 1963. The Milanese Carozzeria Touring Superleggera company built the body, which covered up a 3,996 cc in-line six-cylinder that made 286 hp at 5,500 rpm and 288 lb-ft of torque at 3,850 rpm. The elegant coachwork and a top speed of 142 mph, along with the cachet of being a Bond car, led to a flock of celebrities seeking out the DB5.\nThe likes of Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Ralph Lauren, and other members of the glitterati plunked down the original MSRP of $12,775 (about $130,000 in 2024) to get one of their own.\n[Featured image by Calreyn88 via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY-SA 4.0]\nThe Goldfinger DB5 has appeared in 8 Bond films\nThough 007 has piloted several iconic cars throughout his career, the series keeps returning to the DB5. While the originals used in Goldfinger and Thunderball are scattered to the winds, DB5s have popped up in no fewer than eight Bond films, including:\n- Goldfinger\n- Thunderball\n- Goldeneye\n- Tomorrow Never Dies\n- Casino Royale\n- Skyfall\n- Spectre\n- No Time to Die\nThe Aston Martin DB5 has had its moments in the spotlight, serving as a seductive prop in Goldeneye's mountain race against villainess Xenia Onatopp in a Ferrari F355 supercar. It also played a significant role in Casino Royale, where Bond wins a DB5 from a minor henchman in a poker game, making it a key plot point before he switches to a 2006 Aston Martin DBS for the rest of the film.\nBond's car collection spans a surprising range, which we've ranked from worst to best (some might surprise you). However, the Silver Birch DB5 always reigns supreme. This stylish, gorgeous, and timeless sports car made a stunning debut on the Goldfinger set, and its appeal has only grown with time, evoking a sense of nostalgia for Bond fans.\nAston Martin built a brand new Goldfinger DB5 in 2020\nAston Martin presented a new DB5 in 2020. It wasn't a restoration or rebuild but a continuation car. A true continuation car is a brand-new edition of a vehicle that stopped production many years ago. With Bond's original DB5's lasting reputation, the only surprise is that it took Aston Martin so long to build one.\nThe British carmaker did not quite build it to the original specs of the DP216/1 prototype as sent to the Goldfinger set, but rather as Bond's gadget-laden vehicle after John Stears customized it. You can't deploy smoke, oil, or machine guns against that car that cut you off, but Bond prop veteran Chris Corbould teamed with Aston Martin to get as close as legally possible.\nBeneath all the props, Aston Martin made a picture-perfect rebuild of its most famous car. It still includes the 4.0-liter straight-six engine, period tire specs, and an imperfect chassis that combine to provide the driver with all the charmingly flawed performance of a sixty-year-old vehicle.\nIf you've been waiting your whole life for a chance to own your very own superspy sports car, this might be it \u2014 if you're among the top one percent. The asking price from Aston Martin is around $3.5 million, and it's only producing 25 of them. With the original DB5, reportedly still shrouded in mystery in the Middle East, having an estimated value of $25 million, we don't expect this one to depreciate on the used market like a Honda Accord."
