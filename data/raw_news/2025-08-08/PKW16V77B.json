  "content": "Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has arrived in Lausanne to present the club\u2019s case for reinstatement to the Europa League.\n\nParish and Palace\u2019s lawyers have headed to Switzerland for their appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) which will be heard on Friday, after they were demoted to the Conference League for breaching European football governing body UEFA\u2019s multi-club ownership (MCO) rules.\n\nUEFA deemed the 43 per cent stake that Eagle Football, via its chairman John Textor, owned in Palace to be in conflict with Eagle\u2019s majority stake in French side Lyon after both clubs qualified for the Europa League.\n\nDue to Lyon\u2019s higher domestic finish, they were permitted entry to UEFA\u2019s second tier competition and Palace denied. Nottingham Forest will take their place if the CAS appeal is unsuccessful, having been promoted from the Conference League.\n\nA decision is due to be made on Monday, with Palace, who have hired Swiss lawyers to help their case, hopeful that they can overturn the decision which Parish described as \u201ca terrible injustice\u201d based on \u201cthe most ridiculous technicality you can imagine\u201d.\n\nThey will present a small number of main arguments, conscious of the time restraints given that the hearing will take place over the course of a day. Those points will include the argument that they have been treated unfairly, which is anti-competitive given that UEFA regulations state that all clubs should be treated fairly.\n\nForest, too, will come into their arguments. Palace will make the claim that their fellow Premier League side are effectively in an MCO with Eagle Football\u2019s clubs, given their transfer dealings this summer in particular.\n\nA further point of contention is what Palace believe is an inconsistency in the application of the rules. This has two strands to it, with the deadline of March 1 to put in place sufficient measures to avoid a breach of MCO rules not being applied evenly. They argue that trust documents make it clear the deadline for putting shares into a blind trust was actually April 30.\n\nThey argued in their hearing with UEFA last month that they do not believe Textor, who has now sold Eagle\u2019s Palace stake to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, had decisive influence and putting shares into a blind trust when he was actively trying to sell them would not have been possible, it is the inconsistency in the rules that they are challenging.\n\nThe second strand of the inconsistency argument is their belief that emails show that clubs which belonged to the European Club Association (ECA) were able to be walked through the process of avoiding a breach of MCO rules.\n\nPalace will hope that these arguments are sufficient to sway the three-person panel at CAS and allow them to enter the competition for which they qualified by winning the FA Cup in May.",

      "text": "Common sense would suggest that confirmation of John Textor\u2019s exit from Crystal Palace should resolve the issues around the Premier League club\u2019s connection to French side Lyon. After all, the American investor has now both sold his Palace stake and left all positions of authority at Lyon.\nUnfortunately, one person\u2019s common sense is another\u2019s opinion \u2014 fun to debate, but not the best foundations for a cross-border sports competition involving huge prizes.\nAdvertisement\nTo do that, you are better off with a set of written rules which are fair, proportionate, transparent and well-drafted. If they are not, well, that\u2019s why we invented lawyers.\nThis is where Palace find themselves: denied entrance to the Europa League, the competition they qualified for by winning last season\u2019s FA Cup, and effectively demoted to the third-tier Conference League for breaching European football governing body UEFA\u2019s multi-club ownership (MCO) rules.\nAnd so Palace are taking their case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), asking the so-called \u201csupreme court\u201d of worldwide athletic endeavour to overturn UEFA\u2019s decision.\nPalace have also named Nottingham Forest and Lyon in their appeal, as their fellow Premier League side have been elevated from the Conference League to the second-tier Europa League at their expense, while their disputed stablemates from Ligue 1 have been left in the Europa League, as their higher domestic league finish of the two sides trumps winning the FA Cup.\nSteve Parish, Palace\u2019s chairman, will not mind which of those clubs CAS demotes, as long as what he views as the \u201cterrible injustice\u201d of his team being removed from the Europa League is reversed. He believes he must take this fight on for Palace\u2019s players, staff and fans, as well as others who might find themselves in this position one day. And he clearly thinks this would not happen to a bigger, established side, so there is an \u201cus versus them\u201d element to his crusade.\nHaving said all that, how could Palace go about persuading CAS?\nWhat is CAS?\nIt was then International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch who first realised global sport needed an in-house method for washing dirty linen, as the regular courts are expensive, potentially embarrassing and painfully slow. With the IOC willing to pay for it all, housing it in Lausanne, the Olympic Movement\u2019s Swiss home, made sense.\nAdvertisement\nCAS opened in 1984 and, initially, three-person panels picked from a small pool of experts nominated by the IOC, its president and Olympic federations made decisions about commercial and disciplinary arguments.\nThe system worked pretty well until 1992, when the International Equestrian Federation found a German rider named Elmar Gundel guilty of doping his horse and banned him. When CAS rejected his appeal, Gundel took his fight to Switzerland\u2019s Federal Supreme Court. He did not get much joy there either, but the court did agree that the link between CAS and the IOC was too cosy.\nThe result was the 1994 creation of the International Council of Arbitration for Sport (ICAS), an arms-length body that would run and finance CAS for all Olympic and Paralympic sports. When the World Anti-Doping Agency was created in 1999, CAS was also formally established as the last stop for doping cases.\nIts workload has increased each year.\nIn 2024, more than 900 cases were submitted to CAS, with about 300 progressing to full-blown hearings. It now has 45 permanent staff, plus around 400 experts serving as visiting arbitrators, who are housed in a purpose-built office in Lausanne\u2019s poshest convention centre.\nThe basic proposition has not changed much. Each side in a dispute chooses a member of the panel, with those two usually picking a third expert from the pool to be the panel\u2019s chair. If they can\u2019t decide, ICAS will select one.\nHearings are private, with costs kept low. Verdicts typically come within six to 12 months but expedited hearings are held for matters in need of quick answers, such as doping cases during an ongoing Olympics and over Palace\u2019s predicament. The draw for the final round of Conference League qualifying is a week today (August 4), with those two-legged ties then scheduled for August 21 and 28. Palace, Forest and Lyon need to know ASAP which competition they\u2019re in.\nIn terms of results, sports federations still tend to win the day, as Gundel discovered, but Manchester City famously beat UEFA at CAS in 2020, while Paul Pogba\u2019s doping ban was reduced from four years to 18 months last year, saving his career.\nWhat could Palace argue?\nTextor\u2019s \u2018decisive influence\u2019\nPalace\u2019s starting point is likely to be that Textor, whose Eagle Football Group still contains his controlling stakes at Brazilian side Botafogo, Belgian\u2019s RWDM Brussels (rebranded from Molenbeek earlier this year) and Lyon, did not have what UEFA calls \u201cdecisive influence\u201d at Selhurst Park, and that they have never been part of his multi-club group.\nAdvertisement\nThis, you would think, is supported by the fact he has just sold his 43 per cent stake in Palace to Woody Johnson, the billionaire owner of the NFL\u2019s New York Jets and former U.S. ambassador to the UK. Furthermore, that 43 per cent stake only gave Textor one of four voting shares at Palace, with Parish and two other American investors, David Blitzer and Josh Harris, also holding one each.\nAs Textor has previously explained to The Athletic, decisions at Palace very rarely, if ever, went to a vote, as Blitzer and Harris are silent partners who trust Parish to run things. So, Parish would always have 75 per cent of the votes, and he had no interest in Textor\u2019s plan to integrate the Londoners into the Eagle multi-club universe.\nBlitzer, Harris, Parish and Textor all went to UEFA\u2019s headquarters in the Swiss city of Nyon last month to make this point but the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB), the arms-length unit that decides which teams can and cannot be licensed to play in the three European competitions, wasn\u2019t buying it.\nInstead, it ruled that Textor\u2019s influence was decisive at Palace because he has injected more than \u00a3100million ($134m at the current rate) into the club since 2022, money that helped them finish their new-look academy facilities and sign players, and was the largest single shareholder which meant he must, at the very least, have had a say in what they could and could not do. A decisive say? Well, that is why CAS exists.\nDr Antoine Duval is the head of Asser International Sports Law Centre in the Netherlands and a seasoned watcher of CAS\u2019s decision-making. He believes it\u2019s possible the CAS panel will disagree with the CFCB assessment but says the \u201cquality of the evidence provided by Palace about its internal management structure and the role, or lack of it, of Textor/Eagle will be crucial\u201d.\nTextor\u2019s voting rights will be a key consideration for CAS, but so will his financial contributions and influence on recruitment and commercial strategy.\nFor example, he was a strong advocate of appointing Oliver Glasner, the Austrian head coach who led Palace to their FA Cup triumph, in February last year, although he recently insisted on UK radio station Talksport that the notion he \u201cmade the hire (at Palace) happen\u2026 that\u2019s not true at all. I tried to get him at Lyon \u2014 if he spoke French, he\u2019d be there. I told UEFA that a suggestion is not decisive influence. Nobody tells Steve (Parish) what to do, he\u2019s as stubborn as anybody.\u201d\nPalace, no doubt, will say the only player to be transferred between them and Lyon was centre-back Jake O\u2019Brien in 2023: beyond some young players going on loan to Molenbeek (including O\u2019Brien, earlier in his career), they had no other transactions with an Eagle Football Group club, despite Textor\u2019s frequent suggestions.\nAdvertisement\nBut Dr Gregory Ioannidis, an experienced campaigner at CAS and an associate professor at Sheffield Hallam University, is not sure this will be enough to sway the panel.\nHe believes Palace will try to argue that a \u201cmore flexible and purposeful interpretation of the regulations\u201d should be applied, with the club\u2019s lawyers asking the panel to think about what UEFA is trying to achieve with its MCO rules, fair competition, and whether the English side pose any threat to that legitimate aim.\n\u201cBut if the panel decides the rules are clear, and therefore a strict and literal approach needs to be applied, the chances for a successful appeal will be minimised,\u201d explains Ioannidis.\nWhile each case is considered on its own merits, precedents can be helpful, and two CAS panels have recently made very quick decisions on MCO cases involving Slovakian team FC DAC 1904 and Drogheda United from the Republic of Ireland.\nBoth were blocked from playing in the Conference League by the CFCB and then lost their appeals, DAC unanimously and Drogheda on a majority verdict. The two cases were different but both argued they simply did not have enough time to create the separation UEFA requires between them and their MCO sister clubs.\nAs MCO groups have proliferated across Europe, UEFA has given owners two options: reduce your stake in one of the clubs that want to compete in the same competition to less than 30 per cent, step down as a director and halt whatever player-trading strategy you are pursuing with the two teams, or put one of into a blind trust, so you have no influence over day-to-day operations. Crucially, UEFA moved the deadline for doing one or the other of these workarounds from early June to March 1. DAC, Drogheda and Palace all missed this memo.\nHowever, in both the DAC and Drogheda cases, the CAS panels backed UEFA.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhat is of immense importance here is the panels\u2019 findings that the current regulations do not require evidence of actual influence, but rather only the possibility of such influence,\u201d says Ioannidis. \u201cThis, in conjunction with the finding on the procedural aspect of submitting the changes in the club\u2019s ownership structure on time (or not), may cause serious difficulties for those arguing Palace\u2019s case.\u201d\nParish has explained in recent interviews that Palace were too busy playing Championship neighbours Millwall in the last 16 of the FA Cup on March 1 to be thinking about what might happen if they were to win the whole thing and play in Europe for the first time in their history, but Duval says the deadline argument is doomed.\n\u201cIt seems to me that a possible argument about the new deadline has already been rejected, thus the main focus will probably be on whether Textor had decisive influence,\u201d he says.\nAnd while Palace will come armed with evidence that shows Textor was routinely ignored, UEFA\u2019s lawyers will no doubt point to the letter CFCB chair Sunil Gulati sent to the club licensing managers at UEFA\u2019s 55 member associations last May which spells out what \u201cdecisive influence\u201d means.\nA literal reading of that document \u2014 the 30 per cent shareholding threshold, significant financial support, being a director, the ability to influence recruitment decisions and so on \u2014 would suggest Palace\u2019s legal team are going to have their work cut out.\n\u2018Sporting justice and fairness\u2019\nGiven all that, it might make sense for Palace to make a more general argument that a strict application of the rules in this case simply make no sense, as there is obviously no threat to the integrity of the competition, which is the entire point of article 5.01 in UEFA\u2019s rulebook, the regulation that deals with MCO clubs.\nAnd there is some encouragement here, in that the concepts of fairness, integrity and sporting justice are all enshrined in Swiss law.\nBut there are risks attached to this approach, too.\n\u201cSwiss law does protect such principles and both CAS and the Swiss Federal Tribunal (where any appeals over a CAS verdict are heard but rarely upheld) have ruled accordingly,\u201d says Ioannidis.\n\u201cHowever, I wouldn\u2019t run this argument, because the panel may take the view that it is precisely for these principles that UEFA\u2019s decision may be upheld, as the other clubs in the competition acted promptly and ensured they followed the rules and deadlines.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThat said, the Drogheda case shows that one of the panel disagreed with his colleagues. The written judgment has not been published, so we do not know why they disagreed but it is possible the Irish club\u2019s plea for a more common-sense-based assessment of the rules was persuasive.\nPalace may think that if they can do the same, they are halfway there.\n\u201cNot everything is negative for Palace,\u201d says Ioannidis. \u201cI would argue that the intention of the regulator is to ensure fair competition. As such, the fact that Palace may have realised their mistake and acted in compliance with the rules, albeit late, shows a genuine and honest approach to the legitimate aim pursued by UEFA.\n\u201cIn this instance, it would be fair, just and reasonable for UEFA to allow Palace to be admitted to the Europa League.\u201d\nUEFA \u2018inconsistencies\u2019\nAnother possible line of attack for Palace is the apparent inconsistencies in the application of UEFA\u2019s rules \u2014 and this is where the decision to make Forest a party in this appeal is intriguing.\nThe argument, presumably, would be that Evangelos Marinakis, owner of both Forest and Greece\u2019s Olympiacos, did not place the former in a blind trust until the end of April, a move he reversed when they eventually failed to join their cousins from Athens in next season\u2019s Champions League. It is a moot point now but Marinakis seemed to miss the UEFA deadline, too, and, if literal readings are important, you either meet it or you don\u2019t.\nIf Palace wanted to be really mischievous, they could ask what Marinakis was doing on the pitch at the end of Forest\u2019s home draw against Leicester City on May 11. While he may well have been checking on the health of an injured Forest player, the episode suggested the Greek billionaire still exerted some influence at the City Ground despite that blind-trust move.\nAnd, just to add some further spice to the pot, Parish has suggested that Forest played a part in Palace\u2019s demotion to the Conference League.\nBut an argument that effectively depends on the panel accepting that it is OK for a club to be confused about the regulations is unlikely to pan out.\n\u201cThe rules and deadlines have always been there, and Palace had to act promptly, irrespective of what other clubs did,\u201d says Ioannidis. \u201cThe panel might say that a professional club, with an army of expert lawyers, ought to be more diligent and proactive. If confused, they could have asked UEFA for clarification.\u201d\nAnd with that sensible advice, we should probably wrap this up and wait for CAS to make sense of it all. Hopefully.\n(Top photo: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)"
