      "title": "Recycled Metal Market Opportunities and Strategies to 2034: A New Era of Sustainable Metals With Quantified Recycled Content",
      "summary": "The global recycled metal market is projected to grow from $71.96 bn in 2024 to $143.84 bn by 2034, driven by construction, electronics, and infrastructure demand, with Asia Pacific and Western Europe as the fastest‑growing regions. Growth has been supported by economic expansion, automotive and steel usage, and government support, while future growth may be constrained by labor shortages and regulatory tightening. Leading players such as Sims Metal Management and Radius Recycling are expanding through M&A, technology upgrades, and strategic partnerships to capture opportunities in steel, aluminum, and copper recycling. Companies are urged to invest in advanced recycling technologies, focus on purity and sustainability, and expand into emerging markets to meet low‑carbon metal demand.",
