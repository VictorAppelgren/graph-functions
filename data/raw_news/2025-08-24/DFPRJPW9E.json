  "title": "I'm a diehard Google Pixel fan - here's why I'm not upgrading to the latest model",
  "description": "Last year's Pixel 9 Pro is still a near-perfect phone. Is this year's model a significant enough upgrade? I'm not seeing it.",
  "content": "\u2022 Google's new Pixel 10 isn't worth the upgrade for me.\n\u2022 It comes down to cost, color, and lack of new killer features.\n\u2022 Too much AI is also a deterrent.\n\nThe new Pixel 10 is upon us, and, as usual, Google wants us all to upgrade. For many of us, trading in our current model for a discount on the newer version has become a yearly tradition. I've done it ever since Google adopted the trade-in policy, and it has served me well.\n\nHowever, this year is different. I will not be upgrading to the Pixel 10. Why, you ask? Allow me to break it down.\n\nGet more ZDNET: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nIt starts with the cost\n\nFor the past few years, I've dropped between $600 and $1,000 (depending on trade-in value and availability) every time Google has released a new phone. If you add in the latest Pixel Watch, you can add roughly $400 to that total.\n\nAlso: You can delete sent text messages on Android now - here's how\n\nThis year, with the price of everything increasing, spending upwards of $1,000 on a new phone/watch is hard to justify. At this point in time, the cost of living has precluded my ability to spend on -- what many would consider -- an unnecessary expense. Additionally, the rising inflation has forced me to rethink such purchases.\n\nThe cost of the combined phone and watch roughly equals a mortgage payment or month of rent, and I would rather have a roof over my head than a new phone in my bag. It could end there, but it doesn't.\n\nHere's the thing: My Pixel 9 Pro is the best phone I've ever used. No, it's not perfect, but no phone is. But it's as close to perfection as Google has ever produced. Is it worth spending close to a grand for what seems to be a minor upgrade?\n\nSure, Google is embedding even more AI into the phone, but that doesn't excite me. What excites me is more powerful and sleek hardware, and in those two categories, the upgrade from the Pixel 9 Pro to the Pixel 10 Pro is just too incremental to have me jonesing to buy.\n\nAlso: Google can read your Docs to you now\n\nIt would take something pretty special to get me to upgrade from the Pixel 9 Pro, and the 10 doesn't achieve that feat.\n\nAnother reason (and some might think this silly) is that my Pixel 9 Pro colorway has been my favorite to date, and the offered colors for the 10 do not include it. In fact, the Pixel 10 Pro colorways are rather boring. I'm a fan of aesthetics (and good design, and powerful hardware), so in that respect, upgrading to the Pixel 10 Pro would be a downgrade for me.\n\nMy Pixel 9 Pro still performs like it's brand new, and that performance blows away all phones I've used in the past. In my view, Google created a problem for itself with the Pixel 9 Pro because it's a phone that I simply don't want to let go of. I look at it the same way as I do Ubuntu Linux releases: every other year, they unleash a new LTS (Long Term Support) version of the OS, and most users skip the non-LTS releases. That's how I'm starting to see the Pixel phone releases.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't hate AI. For example, one of the new AI features allows Gemini to connect to Maps and find restaurants, then text the list to the family group chat for you. It's possible that, via Gemini, Google can then build an even more accurate profile of you and your preferences. Gemini will also make it possible to share your camera in Gemini Live.\n\nAlso: 5 AI features on the Pixel 10 that Google thinks will win you over (including the Fold)\n\nYou'll also get a 1-year subscription to the Gemini AI Pro plan, which is $20/month. What if Google doesn't make it obvious or easy to cancel that plan, or you forget to cancel it? I've had that happen to me on several occasions, and getting the money back is no easy feat.\n\nAgain, no thanks.\n\nThere's also the new Magic Cue feature that further personalizes AI to help \"connect the dots across your digital life.\" I personally don't want AI anticipating my needs, as I do that well enough on my own.\n\nThe one thing I might miss out on\n\nI will say this: the new Pixelsnap feature sounds pretty cool. Essentially, this feature adds magnetic tech to the Pixel phone so you can \"snap\" your phone to accessories (such as chargers). In my case, I purchased a case for my Pixel 9 Pro, which has a magnetic feature built in as well, so I don't actually need this. However, if I decided to go without a case, I'd lose the feature. Not so with the Pixel 10.\n\nAlso: Google Wallet adds support for another official state ID\n\nSorry, Google, I love your phones, but I love my Pixel 9 Pro more than I love the idea of dropping a grand on an incremental (at best) upgrade. I'll keep my pink Pixel 9 Pro until a new Pixel makes my current one look and feel obsolete.",

Now, you can hear your Google Docs documents read aloud courtesy of an AI-powered skill from Gemini AI.\nFloating playback toolbar\nOn Monday, Google announced a new feature that essentially creates audio versions of your Google Docs documents. By activating this skill, you can hear the entire document read aloud from start to finish.\nUsing a floating, movable toolbar, you're able to pause and resume playback, move forward or backward in the document, alter the speed, and change the voice. You can even add an audio button to your document to let your readers listen to it as well.\nAlso: How to turn off Gemini in your Gmail, Docs, Photos, and more - it's easy to opt out\n\"Whether you want to hear your content out loud, absorb information better while reading, or help catch errors in your writing, audio versions of your documents provide you with clear, natural-sounding voices that read your documents aloud,\" Google said in a Monday blog post. \"You also have the option to customize your audio experience with a variety of voices and playback speeds to match your personal preferences.\"\nCurious? Here's how this works\nOpen a document in Google Docs that you want to hear read aloud. Click the Tools menu, move to the Audio command, and select \"Listen to this tab.\" The default voice immediately starts reading your document aloud from the beginning.\nUsing the floating audio toolbar, you can then pause the audio and scrub forward or backward. Select the button for Playback speed, and you're able to set the speed at any level from 0.5 to 2 times.\nNot crazy about the voice? Click the three-dot More options button on the toolbar to try a different one, such as Narrator, Educator, Teacher, Persuader, Explainer, Coach, or Motivator. Just click the play button in the menu to hear each one speak in its own gender, style, and pitch.\nAlso: I tested ChatGPT's Deep Research against Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok AI to see which is best\nWant other people to hear your document as well? At the floating toolbar, click the More options button and select \"Insert audio button.\" A \"Listen to this tab\" button is placed in the position of your text cursor. Anyone who opens the document can click that button to hear it read aloud.\nTo customize it, hover over the button and select the pencil icon. In the sidebar for the audio button, you're able to change the name, size, and color of the button.\nAvailability\nThe new audio skill is available to Google Workspace users with business, enterprise, or educational plans, as well as to those with an AI Pro or AI Ultra subscription. For now, it's accessible only in English and only on the desktop.\nAlso: Collaborating in Google Drive? Gemini can catch you up on changes made to your files now\nAs a writer, I sometimes listen to my Microsoft Word documents read aloud. This capability helps me not only catch spelling and grammatical errors, but hear how my writing actually sounds. I can then pause the narration, revise any word or sentence that needs fixing, and resume. The audio feature now in Google Docs is similar and works smoothly, so it's one I'll turn to from now on."

Finally, Android is invited to the magnetic snap party, with the Pixel 10 being the first Android to support wireless charging with a magnetic snap and the Qi2 charging standard. Google is launching Pixelsnap alongside three accessories to start, with an entire ecosystem of branded accessories coming down the road.\nSince the technology here is based on the Qi2 wireless charging standard, any of the MagSafe accessories previously marketed for iPhones will work on the Pixel 10. This opens up a ton of options for Android users who were previously relegated to workarounds and third-party products with varying degrees of success.\nThe Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) announced its pursuit of a standardized system for Apple and Android devices as far back as two years ago, but magnetic Qi2 charging technology built into the phones has been sorely missing from Android devices for years.\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but Google just sold me on the Pixel 10 with these features\nThis is despite the fact that Androids were the first to offer wireless charging over 10 years ago, but have since been outpaced by the iPhone's MagSafe feature, which has spawned an entire ecosystem of products from wallets to chargers to other accessories.\nGoogle's branded products releasing today include the Pixelsnap ring stand for $29, which just props your phone up on a surface and acts as a secondary grip, the Pixelsnap charger that snaps to the back of the phone but has a wired connection for $39, and a combo charger with a stand for $69.\nYou can expect a host of new products in the Pixelsnap ecosystem soon, including everything we see from MagSafe products like car mounts, grips, wallets, and other unique accessories.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nAll of the new Pixel 10 models will support PixelSnap wireless charging, reaching speeds of up to 25W, the Qi2 standard for both iPhones and Android devices.\nFor Apple, this means losing its majority market share in the MagSafe accessory category, since many of the devices that were previously marketed for the iPhone will now work on the Pixel 10. If additional Android models open up to this feature (and they most certainly will), it will no longer be a selling point unique to the iPhone."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nMy Google Pixel 9 wish list may upset some Android fans (but it'll be worth it)\nI'm inching ever so closer to making the decision that the upcoming Nothing Phone 3 will be my next phone. Why? I outlined the two main reasons why this choice is looming, and I know I'm not alone in that position. And although AI isn't nearly the tipping point for most as it is for me, the other sticking point in that article is fairly universal.\nAlso: I'm a diehard Pixel user, but I'm considering a change for two reasons (and I'm not alone)\nI also know that Google is neck-deep in AI and there's no going back from this point. As for the bland hardware designs, at least there's a little hope.\nLike most Pixel fans, I've been following the rumors and leaks closely and I actually like what I see. One of the issues I've had with the design of older Pixel 6 and 7 models was the beveled edges. Google walked those back with the Pixel 8 series but left the metal edges still slightly curvy. That change at least made the Pixel slightly easier to hold.\nBut then you compare the Pixel 8 Pro to that of the iPhone and you see a clear difference. Apple goes with a flat, clean edge on its devices, while the Pixel's edge is forever changing and always looking less than premium. That would be fine if the price of the Pixel 8 Pro matched the aesthetic -- only it doesn't. There are phones available that look the part of premium without the premium price. Of course, the performance of those devices do not match that of the Pixel.\nAlso: The Pixel 9 could offer two new emergency features, thanks to a new Samsung modem\nBut, no matter how much Google shrugs off aesthetics, they're important. One of the reasons why the iPhone is so popular is because of the way it looks. For many, the iPhone is as much an accessory as it is a device. It's iconic. The Pixel, on the other hand, is almost brutalistic. It's the pragmatist of phones.\nI expect the Pixel Phone 9/9 Pro will change that slightly. The leaked renders I've seen have the phones with a much flatter edge that looks premium, almost iPhone-ish. That's a good thing; not only because it improves the design of the phone but also because it makes them easier to grip.\nAlso: I love this iPhone case's physical keyboard, but that isn't even its best feature\nI don't want to sound as if the look of a phone is more important than the functionality, because it's not. But the design of a device has the ability to bring new users to the table. If a consumer looks at a display table of phones and sees a boring, uninspired design, chances are slim they'll be willing to pay the premium. And as their eyes drift from the edge of the device to the camera bar, the turn-off is even greater. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, of course.\nLooking past the hardware\nAnother aesthetic advantage iPhones have over Pixels is the smoothness of the UI. Outside of the garage sale of icons on the home screen, iOS looks fantastic. The tasteful blur, the use of transparency, and the buttery smooth animations make Android look like a child's toy whose batteries are just about to run out.\nEven the Pixel 8 Pro, which is powered by Google's Tensor G3 chip, shows how inelegant the UI really is. Pull down the notification shade -- there's no transparency, no blur. I've been testing Android 15 and it shows very little sign of change with the UI, but hopefully Google will finally understand that change is necessary.\nAlso: Here are the top five Android 15 features I love the most\nAlthough I don't expect we'll see much in the way of change with the UI in the Pixel 9, I do believe the animations will be far smoother than they have been. I've already noticed an improvement in Android 15 beta. Even with the lesser-powered chip in the Pixel 7 Pro, the animations are smoother than they are on my Pixel 8 Pro.\nMaybe Google finally realized that the way a phone's UI moves about on the screen is actually important. Could it be? I think so. When I pull down the notification shade on my Pixel 8 Pro (running Android 14), there's always a slight lag before it moves. Once it starts moving, there's a slight jump to catch up. On the Pixel 7 Pro (running Android 15 beta) it responds immediately -- there's no lag and no jump.\nAlso: Google launches Android 15 Beta 1. Here's what's inside and how to get it\nIn the end, if Google wants to prevent a mass exodus from the Pixel, it needs to start paying more attention to design and less attention to AI. If I had to take a guess, I would venture that consumers are more easily impressed with a better-looking phone over one that's steeped in AI. Just look at Apple. They've lagged in the AI category and their sales haven't suffered one bit. They keep cranking out the same, well-designed hardware and software, and users don't bat an eye. I hope Google becomes just as consistent."

      "text": "6 reasons why I've stuck with Ubuntu-based Linux distros for the last 20 years\nIt was October 2004, and I'd been using Red Hat Linux (way before it became Fedora) for years. I was fairly certain that would be my distribution until the world ended. I'd become comfortable with Red Hat. Sure, it had its quirks and was sometimes a bit more difficult than it needed to be (remember, it was over 20 years ago), but it was stable and I'd grown to know it well.\nBut then a new distribution arrived on the scene... Ubuntu. Oddly enough, the first version to hit the market was 4.10, aka \"Warty Warthog.\" I'd not heard much about Ubuntu, but my curiosity was piqued, so I decided I would install it over Red Hat and see what was what. Since that moment, I've pretty much stuck with Ubuntu-based distributions for more than 20 years.\nAlso: The easiest way to try out Ubuntu Linux\nIn fact, other than testing, I can't remember the last distribution I used that wasn't based on Ubuntu. What makes Ubuntu so special that I've refused to even consider switching to another distro with a different base? Let me tell you.\n1. Reliable updates\nOver the two decades I've been using Ubuntu-based distributions, I believe I've only experienced one issue where an update wasn't successful, and the only reason that happened was because the OS I was updating had been dramatically customized to the point it was almost unrecognizable. With that upgrade, I did wind up having to scrap it and do a fresh installation, but again, that was one instance over a span of 21 years. Not a bad track record.\nAlso: While Windows 10 users panic, Ubuntu makes extending support easy - here's how\nOther than that, every upgrade I've executed on an Ubuntu-based distribution went off without a hitch. With Ubuntu (and Ubuntu-based distributions), I never hesitate to run upgrades (minor or major) because I know they'll work. With that in mind, why would I ever want to switch to a different base? It's that much of a no-brainer.\n2. Ease of installation\nUbuntu has, for a very long time, offered the best installation experience of all Linux distributions. This is especially true with the latest version of the installer. Not only is the latest installer incredibly simple to use, but it's also one of the most elegantly designed. Many Linux installers still look as if they were designed in the early 2000s.\nAlso: 5 of the easiest, quickest Linux distros to install - and I've tried them al\nSome might say that the look of the installer shouldn't matter, but I disagree. The installer app is the first thing new users experience, and it should be something that not only makes them feel comfortable but also gives them the impression that Linux is just as modern as macOS and/or Windows. And, similar to the upgrades, I've never experienced an Ubuntu installation go sideways.\n3. Hardware support\nUbuntu (and Ubuntu-based distributions) has some of the best hardware support available. I can plug almost anything in, and it will be automatically recognized. Hardware support has become one of the big selling points for Ubuntu, and I've personally rarely experienced a situation where the distribution couldn't recognize a peripheral or internal device.\nYes, there have been instances where I've had to locate a driver for something, but the good thing about using Ubuntu is that, if a company has created a Linux driver for a device, you can be certain they've created one for Ubuntu. In fact, I've experienced some situations where Ubuntu was the only distribution a company developed for.\nAlso: I'm a Linux power user, and the latest Ubuntu update put a smile on my face\nI will say this: Fedora is a more cutting-edge distribution, which means it often gains support for newer hardware faster than Ubuntu, but the advantage it has over Ubuntu-based distributions is slim.\n4. Software availability\nSimilar to hardware support, I've run into situations where companies have developed ports of their software, but only for Ubuntu. Beyond that, Ubuntu has some of the largest software repositories of any distribution. On top of that, you get Snap out of the box (at least with some Ubuntu-based distributions), which means you have even more software available to install. Add Flatpak and AppImages, and the amount of software you can install is staggering.\nAlso: The best Linux distributions for beginners: Expert tested and reviewed\nThat's not to say that Ubuntu has more software than any other distribution. It would be next to impossible to calculate that because there are so many repositories (official and unofficial) for nearly every distribution available. But Ubuntu-based distributions get the edge because when third-party companies develop for Linux, you know they'll release a version of their software for Ubuntu.\n5. A vast community\nBecause there are so many Ubuntu-based distributions, there's a massive community out there for support and interaction. But we're not just talking about users. There is a vast number of contributors across various projects for Ubuntu, which means it enjoys serious active development. Thanks to Ubuntu's widespread usage, this isn't going to be shrinking any time soon.\nAlso: 10 things I always do after installing Ubuntu to instantly improve the experience\nIt could be said that the large number of distributions based on Ubuntu (and there are a lot) means the community is watered down because it is spread out across so many \"flavors.\" I would argue that's not an issue because a user of, say, elementaryOS could still be helped by a user of Ubuntu, thanks to the similar base. When using an Ubuntu-based distribution, you can be certain that there's a forum, mailing list, user, or website available to help you out of a jam.\n6. Ubuntu is for the average user\nWhen I think of Ubuntu, I think of an operating system for the masses. This isn't a niche distribution; it's created so that everyone can use and enjoy it. Ubuntu is intentionally designed so that the average user can log in and immediately understand how the desktop works. Yes, the design of the desktop might be a bit different from what you're accustomed to, but it's still easy enough that it won't stump you.\nAlso: Why this Linux distro is my new favorite Windows replacement\nTo me, that's an important distinction, because Linux needs to attract as many users as possible, especially with Windows 10 support coming to an end.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

I saw that as an opportunity to jump ship.\nMy goal was to buy the Nothing Phone 3. Then, as fate would have it, Nothing CEO Carl Pei announced that his company was going all-in on AI, and the next Nothing Phone would leverage the technology in ways no other device had.\nFoiled again.\nAlso: This hidden Pixel camera setting makes my photos absolutely pop - here's how\nShortly after, I looked into the Pixel 9 Pro series, which Google has made clear it's serious about returning the \"flagship\" moniker to the lineup. Instead of questionable design choices for the hardware (like the unsightly camera hump, too-slick glass, and oddly-beveled edges), Google opted for a classier look.\nThe company succeeded.\nI placed my order, traded in my Pixel 8 Pro, and got a whopping $700 in credit. I sat back and waited. A couple of weeks later, my pink Pixel 9 Pro arrived. As soon as I unboxed it, my first thought was, \"Now this is a flagship device.\"\nThe build quality is stellar, the look is beautiful, and the feel is great -- and that was all before I switched the phone on.\nThe first thing you'll notice with the Pixel 9 is the flat edges, which give the phone a very polished look. Practically speaking, those flat edges make the Pixel 9 Pro exponentially easier to pick up.\nAlso: Two new Android 16 security features protect you better - how to switch them on now\nThis was one of my big complaints with the Pixel 8 Pro. When the Pixel 8 phone is on a flat surface, it can be hard to pick up with any confidence. Because of the slick surface, the phone is prone to slip from between my fingers. Not that dropping a phone a few inches to a table surface would damage the device, but it's certainly frustrating.\nThat issue is no more. The Pixel 9 Pro is far easier to pick up.\nBeyond the feel of it all, the Pixel 9 look is just spot on. Yes, it's very iPhone-like, but I don't see that as a bad thing. There's a reason why Apple has stuck to a similar chassis design\u2026 because it works, and it screams \"I'm a flagship device!\"\nAlso: My top 6 open-source Android apps from the Google Play Store - and why that's important\nAlso, the camera hump is so much nicer. On the Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel 8 Pro, the camera hump made the phone look cheap. It almost seemed \"accidental.\" Now? The camera hump looks intentional in design, and it fits the look and feel of the device much better than in previous iterations.\nFinally, the size of the Pixel 9 Pro is perfect. It's a bit shorter than the Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel 8 Pro, which means it's easier to use with one hand.\nSetting up my Pixel (from an older model)\nNormally, when transferring data from one Pixel to another, you're prompted to connect the phones via a USB-C cable and allow the data to transfer (a process that can take some time). With the Pixel 9 lineup, it's all done via Bluetooth, and it's surprisingly fast and easy. I would go so far as to say this is the simplest and quickest transfer from one Pixel to another that I've experienced (and I've been doing this since the early Pixel days).\nAlso: Google quietly confirms ChromeOS-Android merger - here's what it means for you\nOf course, not everything transferred. In terms of credentials, only my Gmail account was automatically added. I had to input other app logins manually. This is to be expected, and I didn't mind having to log back into certain apps and add my non-Gmail accounts.\nMy experience\nEver since the Pixel 6 Pro, I've found Google's top phone's performance outstanding. The Pixel 9 Pro takes this up a notch, and finally, Android can really show off animations on par with iOS. Everything is buttery smooth, and apps launch instantly. Scroll through the App Drawer, and you no longer experience stutters and jumps.\nThe display of the Pixel 9 Pro is nothing short of incredible. Normally, I switch off the Ambient Display feature because the display tends to get a bit too dark. On the Pixel 9 Pro, I have yet to feel the need to shut off that feature. Sure, the display adjusts to the smallest change in ambient light, but it never gets too dim to see clearly.\nIf I manually adjust the brightness all the way up, it's very bright. In fact, this is the first phone I've used where I thought the display at full brightness was almost too bright. Images have more depth and clarity when displayed on the Pixel 9 Pro.\nThe night before last, I forgot to put my phone on the charger overnight. When I woke up the next morning and saw it on my desk, the percentage of the remaining battery was 76%. Instead of placing it on its cradle so it could charge, I decided to use it and wait until my usual time (around 6 PM -- I like to completely disconnect at the end of the day) to set it on the Pixel stand.\nAlso: Going off-grid? Leave your flagship at home and take this $300 Android instead. Here's why\nBy the end of the day, the phone was at 50%. Granted, I'm not on my phone constantly throughout the day but, even so, that's impressive. It's not any sort of battery benchmark that I could honestly go by, but knowing the phone can go without an overnight charge and the battery barely budges an inch downward is a pretty good indication that this phone will more than go the distance.\nBottom line (for now)\nIt's early in my relationship with the Pixel 9 Pro, but I'm ready to proclaim that Google has finally created a Pixel phone worthy of the flagship title. I can't wait to see how Android 15 will run on this baby because it runs like a champ on my Pixel 7 Pro.\nLooking for the next best product?

      "text": "Want to learn Linux? These 5 games make it fun - and they're free\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- If you need to up your Linux skills, play a game.\n- There are several games, each focusing on a different skill.\n- These games are free to play as often as you need.\nGet more ZDNET: Add us as a preferred Google source.\nFor many, the idea of learning Linux is a task best left to the geeks. The good news is that desktop Linux has become so easy to use that you don't have to worry about the challenges that may have kept you from diving in. With modern Linux desktop distributions, there's no need to learn the command line or the more advanced tools (such as YaST).\nNow, if you want to really get the most out of Linux, or are considering a career as a Linux administrator, you'll need to learn considerably more\u2026 including the command line. Now that can be intimidating, especially to those who've never opened a terminal window or typed a command.\nAlso: The first 5 Linux commands every new user should learn\nThere's a bit of good news. You can make learning more advanced Linux concepts easier with the help of a few games.\nIf you've never experienced \"gamified learning,\" you're in for a treat because it not only makes learning easy but also fun.\nThere are a few games that are geared specifically for learning Linux skills, and I'm going to introduce you to them now.\n1. OverTheWire\nOverTheWire is a collection of web-based games that challenge you to perform tasks. One of the best things about the OverTheWire games is that they teach you how to solve problems on your own and do so with Linux commands, file permissions, network protocols, text encoding, and more.\nAlso: I'm a command-line pro and this is the best terminal app I've ever used, thanks to AI\nCurrently, there are 12 games, such as Bandi, which is aimed at absolute beginners and teaches the basics necessary to play the other games. There's also:\n- Natas, which teaches the basics of server-side web security.\n- Leviathan, which teaches basic Linux commands.\n- Krypton, which teaches file encoding.\n- Narnia, which teaches basic exploitation.\n- Behemoth, which deals with regular vulnerabilities.\n- Utumno, which teaches more advanced concepts (and even leaves out a description, so you have no idea what you're getting into).\n- Maze, which teaches more advanced exploitation techniques, programming, and reverse engineering.\n- Vortex, which teaches connecting to non-standard ports.\n- Manpage, which is all about breaking common Linux C programming misconceptions.\n- Drifter, which is similar to vortex but is more advanced.\n- Formula One, which teaches you security concepts.\n2. cmdchallenge\nThe idea behind cmdchallenge is simple: solve problems given to you with nothing more than the command line. This is a web-based game, so there's nothing to install. For example, you might be challenged to print \"hello world\" on the terminal with a single command (echo \"hello world\") or print the current working directory (pwd).\nAlso: 10 open-source apps I recommend every Windows user download - for free\nEvery time you get a command right, you are asked to solve another challenge. As you complete each task, it gets slightly more challenging, so the longer you play, the more you'll learn.\n3. Terminus\nTerminus is an interesting terminal adventure app game where you explore a virtual world via Linux commands. For example, you issue the ls command to see what locations are available. You might see WesternForest listed, so you go there with cd WesternForest. When you do that, an image appears to show you what you see.\nAlso: 5 reasons to switch to an immutable Linux distro today\nYou keep exploring different locations and solving puzzles with commands like ls, cd, less, etc. The goal of this game is to learn how to navigate the Linux filesystem.\n4. Bashcrawl\nBashcrawl is a game you install on your Linux machine to help you learn the basics of Linux, BSD, and UNIX terminals. You don't actually install the app, but download the source, unpack it, and then cd into the entrance subdirectory of the newly created directory. You can then read the scroll file with less scroll to find out what to do next.\nThe fun really starts when you can cast \"spells\" with commands, like ls -F. Directories (rooms within the \"catacombs\") end with /, and encounters (programs) end with *. You collect treasure and do all sorts of dungeon crawler-esque things.\n5. Root Me\nRoot Me is more advanced and focused on cybersecurity. This is similar to WarGames, in that it hosts several different challenges in one location. With Root Me, you tackle real-world challenges, such as file forensics, privilege escalation, and more.\nAlso: How much RAM does your Linux PC really need in 2025?\nRoot Me is not for beginners, but for those with enough Linux skills to understand the concepts and issue the correct commands. You do have to create an account, but it's free to use. There are over 600 challenges to take on with Root Me, as well as 178 different virtual environments, and 6063 solutions.\nAll of the above games are free to use as much as you need, and can really help you start to grasp various Linux concepts and commands.\nWant to follow my work?

      "text": "I upgraded my Pixel 9 Pro to Android 16 - here's what I love (and what's still missing)\nAndroid 16 looked to be one of the most impressive upgrades to the mobile operating system in recent times. Google teased some seriously cool features that would elevate Android to the next level. However, although some of those expected features made their way to the final release, some did not.\nBecause some of the more hotly anticipated features have yet to materialize, Android 16 seems (on the surface) to be kinda blah. But don't be fooled. Even though the big UI changes were held back, there's still a lot to love about what was released.\nAlso: Your Android phone just got a major feature upgrade for free - including these Pixel models\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Google released Android 16 early. Usually, those major updates are held back until late summer/fall. (Android 15 was released in September 2024.) Why did Google release this latest update three months early? It's pretty simple: With new Android devices set to release this summer, it's now a safe bet they'll ship with the latest release.\nWhen the Pixel 9 line of phones was released last year, they shipped with Android 14 because 15 wasn't ready. That was a big disappointment to Pixel fans everywhere. To avoid this, Google released a \"version\" of Android 16 to ensure it would be ready for the release of the Pixel 10 phones.\nIn addition, Google has decided to speed up the release of Android, with two releases each year (probably so they can ensure the latest Pixel devices always have the latest version).\nWith that out of the way, let's first talk about what I love in Android 16.\nWhat's to love?\nOK, the \"what's to love\" section is a bit thin at the moment. But that doesn't mean it's not important, because Android 16 brings a few new features that are key to user security. With Android 16, securing your phone became a whole lot easier.\nWithin Settings > \"Security & privacy,\" you'll find an entry called Advanced Protection. When enabled, this all-or-nothing security feature helps defend against online attacks, malicious applications, insecure connections, and other threats. But, like I said, this is all-or-nothing. When you enable Advanced Protection, it's all in, and you can't customize it. That's fine for the majority of users, but you'll want to understand three things:\nAlso: These apps are quietly draining your phone battery - how to find and shut them down\n- Apps on your device can see if Advanced Protection is enabled.\n- Devices with 2G protection available will have 2G connections blocked (with the exception of emergency calling).\n- Some websites may not load properly.\nUnless you have a good reason not to enable Advanced Protection, I highly recommend you do so (it does require a restart).\nThere's also less clutter in the notification shade now because notifications are automatically bundled for each app. This will help to keep your notifications organized and looking less like an alphabet soup of information.\nAndroid 16 also improves battery life. With Pixel devices, there's even a new \"Battery health\" page (Settings > Battery > Battery health) that displays your battery percentage, allows you to change charging optimization and enable battery health assistance, and gives you battery health tips.\nAlso: How to clear your Android phone's cache and make it feel like new\nSpeaking of battery, Android 16 better uses AI to help optimize your battery, so you'll get even more usage from a full charge. I've noticed the difference. Thanks to Android's AI, I'm finding my battery drains a bit slower than it did in Android 15. Since upgrading, I've consistently ended my day (which, granted, comes around 6 p.m. when I dock my phone) in the 70% area (as opposed to the 60% range).\nFor those who use the Linux system on Android, the terminal app now has a tabbed interface, which is really handy. With the tabbed UI, you can run an SSH session in one tab while doing other things in other tabs.\nOK, now that I've told you about some of the features that found their way into Android 16, let's talk about what didn't.\nWhat's missing?\nThe big thing missing is Material 3 Expressive. This was supposed to be the big change for Android, building on Material Design and adding more naturally feeling animations, new icon shapes, background blur effects, improved color themes, home screen enhancements, and UI redesigns for many Google apps.\nI was excited about this feature (especially the background blur effects), but alas, it has yet to arrive. When will it arrive? The closest estimation is \"later this year.\" If I had to guess, Material 3 Expressive will arrive in time for the Pixel 10 release. Surely Google wants to provide the full Android 16 experience with its new devices; otherwise, it would be perceived as a failure to deliver.\nAlso: Why the Android 16 design overhaul has me more excited than ever\nAnother big feature that's missing in this first Android 16 release is Desktop Mode, similar to Samsung's DeX mode. Desktop Mode is exactly what it sounds like: Plug your Android Phone into an external display, and you'll experience a desktop-like environment.\nSadly, not yet. You won't even find the \"Enable desktop experience features\" option in Settings > System > Developer options (which is where it was in the beta).\nLooks like we're going to have to wait for those two features (which were often touted as the biggest new additions to Android 16).\nPatience, patience, patience\nIn this never-ending cycle of releases, it gets harder and harder to remain patient. I'm fairly certain we'll see these two big features arrive when the Pixel 10 devices are released, so it should only be a few short months. Even so, those two missing pieces make the release of Android 16 feel a bit uninspired. When those two additions find their way into the OS, however, it will feel like a brand new OS.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

Instead, it competes by adding quality-of-life features -- a couple of which are industry-firsts for a foldable phone.\nIf you are ready to upgrade from a slab phone to a foldable one, now is the best time to do so. However, it can be confusing to make a decision when both Google and Samsung book-style foldables are so good this year.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nHere's how the new Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold compares to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, and which one is the best for you.\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nYou should buy the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold if\u2026\n1. You work in a dust-prone environment\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first book-style foldable to sport an IP68 rating, which means it is truly resistant against minute dust particles. In comparison, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rated IP48 for dust and water resistance, so it is protected against solid particles bigger than 1 millimeter. Since dust particles are smaller than 1mm, there's no guarantee that a Z Fold 7 will do well against dust.\nAlso: Google just settled the foldable phone debate with one number -- and I hope Samsung is watching\nIf you live in a place susceptible to dust or work in a dusty environment, the Google foldable will serve you better. It isn't dustproof, per se, but you can get extra peace of mind when using it in those environments.\n2. You are shifting from an iPhone\nIf you can't wait for a foldable iPhone and want to switch to a book-style foldable this year, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the phone to buy. While switching to a Samsung foldable is equally easy/tedious, you'll be able to retain your iPhone's MagSafe-compatible accessories if you buy the Google foldable.\nThe Pixel 10 series comes with a new feature called PixelSnap. It is like MagSafe, where you get magnets to attach a slew of accessories. The new tech is based on Qi2 standards and offers 15W wireless charging on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. So, if you have MagSafe-compatible charging pads, power banks, or even tripods, they should theoretically be compatible with the new Google phones. This makes shifting to an Android foldable easier for an iPhone user.\n3. You want a more affordable folding phone\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best (if not the best) book-style foldables you can buy right now. It weighs less than most slab flagship phones and feels like a 'normal' phone in the hand. But it also carries a massive $2000 price tag. If you don't want to spend two grand on your new phone, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the way to go.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nThe new Google foldable undercuts its Samsung rival by $200. The base 256GB storage variant is priced at $1,800. You can currently purchase the Galaxy Z Fold 7 for as low as $1,700 on Amazon, but that's the current discount price. Once it goes on sale, you should be able to find discounts on the Pixel foldable, too.\n4. You want to use all the Gemini AI features for a year\nIf you are new to the AI world and want to try the best of Google AI features for free, Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the way to go. The company is offering a year's worth of Gemini AI Pro subscription for free with its Pixel 10 Pro series. This means you can get enhanced features like access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Veo 3 for AI-generated videos, 2TB of cloud storage, and previews of upcoming AI tools. By contrast, Samsung is giving six months of free access to the same service with its Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nYou should buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 if\u2026\n1. You want the slimmest and lightest folding phone\nI love my Galaxy Z Fold 7 for its slim and light design. In fact, it is more comfortable to hold and use than big flagship phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Samsung's own Galaxy S25 Ultra. At 215 grams, it is one of the most comfortable phones to use on the market right now. Plus, it measures just 8.9mm when folded and 4.2mm when unfolded, which feels surreal at times.\nAlso: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\nSamsung has almost perfected the form factor with its latest foldable. If you want a foldable phone without the foldable design quirks, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the phone for you (if you are a right-hander, because hinge edges are still very sharp for left-handed people).\n2. A folding phone's crease bothers you\nWhen I first unboxed the Galaxy Z Fold 7, I was amazed by the inner screen's flatness when I rubbed my hand over it. If you have used a folding phone before but couldn't live with it because of a gigantic crease running down the middle of its big screen, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be a breath of fresh air for you.\nSamsung's new folding phone features the smallest crease in its segment. You can still see it at certain angles, but it won't bother you at all. In comparison, Google's crease situation still needs work.\n3. You want a polished suite of AI features\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 can run Gemini, but the Pixel 10 Pro Fold can't run Galaxy AI features. That's not to say the Google phone doesn't have exclusives. The new Magic Cue and Camera Coach features are worth trying.\nAlso: PixelSnap is the MagSafe for Android phones we've been waiting for - here's our first look\nHowever, Galaxy AI has a more tried-and-tested suite of comparatively more polished AI features, such as AI Select, a damn good object eraser, and more. You can also avail free six months of Gemini AI Pro to try Veo 3, NotebookLM, etc., with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.\n4. You want to buy a foldable in the next few weeks\nIf you want to buy a new folding phone in the next month, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is your only choice because the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't go on sale till October 9. That's seven weeks after launch. By contrast, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is already available and might persuade potential Pixel buyers, especially at the new price.\nI have yet to use the Pixel 10 Pro Fold as a daily driver, so I don't have an opinion on the cameras or battery life. While it packs a bigger cell than its counterpart, I'll only be able to tell the difference after I have used it in daily life. Both phones run Android 16 out of the box and are promised to receive up to seven years of OS and Android security updates, so they should last long."

      "text": "Google Wallet adds support for another official state ID, bringing the total to 8\nZDNET's takeaways\n- Montana residents can now add their state ID to Google Wallet.\n- This addition brings the feature to a total of eight states.\n- Digital IDs are a companion to your physical ID, not a replacement.\nGet more ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source.\nOne more state has joined the list that officially lets you use Google Wallet as your ID.\nMontana residents can now add their official state driver's license or ID card to Google Wallet\nThe state joins seven others, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, and New Mexico, that let you add your ID to Wallet.\nAlso: Scammers are sneaking into Google's AI summaries to steal from you - how to spot them\nIf you're not already using Google Wallet, here's a primer on why you should. While the app is still primarily used for payments, it has expanded over the past few years to include gym passes, transit passes, event tickets, loyalty cards, hotel keys, company IDs, and just about anything else \u2013 even official state IDs.\nHow to add your Montana ID to Google Wallet\nTo enroll use your Montana state ID in Google Wallet, the MVD explains, you'll need three things: a valid and easily readable Montana driver license or state-issued ID card, the Google Wallet app installed on an Android device (a device that came with Android 9.0 or higher), and an authentication method for your device like PIN, facial identification, pattern swipe, or fingerprint.\nAny Montana ID works, even if it's not a Real ID.\nYou can add your Montana ID to Wallet by tapping the \"+ Add to Wallet\" icon on the bottom right corner of the app and then looking for ID among the available options and selecting \"Drivers license or state ID.\" Google will ask you to add photos of the front and back of your ID, and take a short selfie video of your face. Google will share your card info and an image of your face from the video with the MVD.\nAlso: 6 reasons why I switched to a digital wallet, and you should too\nVerification will take a few minutes, but you'll get an email from the MVD when done.\nThe biggest advantage of a digital ID\nTo use your digital ID, either tap your phone on the reader or scan a QR code. Your phone will ask what information you want to share, you'll verify with a PIN or face unlock, and the info will transfer via Bluetooth. You don't need to hand over your phone at any time.\nThose last two parts are perhaps the best part of using your Google Wallet ID -- you only share the information that's absolutely necessary, and you significantly lessen the chance of leaving your license behind (or having it fall into the wrong hands).\nRemember that the Google Wallet version of your ID is a companion to your physical ID, not a complete replacement. Not all places that need to verify your ID will have the mobile ID verification app. You can use your digital ID at some TSA locations, but it's a good idea to always have your physical card."

The toggles for the AI suggestion features, called \"camera roll sharing suggestions,\" appear to be turned on for users who claim they haven't seen a pop-up from Facebook asking for permission to enable them. If you get that \"cloud processing\" pop-up and tap \"Allow\" on it, you'll agree to Meta's AI Terms of Service and permit your \"media and facial features\" to be analyzed by AI.\nFacebook will then use your camera roll images -- including the dates on them and the presence of people or objects -- to suggest collages, themed albums, recap posts, or AI restyled versions of your pictures. These AI suggestions are only visible to you, unless you choose to share them, and Meta says the media won't be used for ad targeting.\nAlso: How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work\nBut, to be clear, you're still giving Meta the right to access and retain your camera roll images, and that could raise serious privacy concerns, especially for users who never knowingly opted in.\nZDNET's editorial director found Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions enabled in her Facebook app without her knowledge. I also noticed they were enabled for me, although I vaguely recall seeing a pop-up from Facebook about the new features a few weeks ago. I think I dismissed it quickly, and I can't remember whether I tapped Allow or Don't allow on it.\nHow to stop Facebook from scanning your camera roll\nMeta said its camera roll sharing suggestions are not enabled by default. If you're worried you dismissed Facebook's pop-up, unknowingly opted-in, and gave access to your camera roll, here's how to check and turn it off.\n1. Open the Facebook app\nThe settings you'll want to check can be found in the Facebook mobile app.\n- Grab your iPhone or Android phone.\n- Open the Facebook app. You'll need to be signed into your account.\n2. Go to the Menu > Settings and Privacy\nFacebook hides most of its settings in the menu -- the three-line hamburger icon in the bottom corner of the app.\n- Tap the Menu icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.\nOnce the menu opens, look for Settings and Privacy with a gear icon. This will take you directly to Settings.\n3. Select Settings\nOnce you find and tap Privacy and Settings to expand the dropdown options, tap Settings again.\n- Under Settings and Privacy, tap Settings.\n- Now, scroll down and look for \"Camera roll sharing suggestions.\"\n4. Go to Camera roll sharing suggestions\nMeta placed the toggles that grant it access to your camera roll under the \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" setting. You'll need to go there to see if they're on and, if so, switch them off.\n- Look for the option labeled \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" and tap it.\n- This will open a preference page with a couple of toggles.\n5. Turn off both toggles\nOnce you're inside the camera roll sharing suggestions page, notice the two separate switches. If they're blue and the toggle circle is pushed to the right, they're on -- meaning Meta is already processing and retaining your phone's photos. Turn them off so the app can't automatically upload and analyze your camera roll.\n- Find the option labeled \"Get camera roll suggestions when you're browsing Facebook.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from using basic camera roll data, such as which videos you've favorited and when photos were taken, to suggest sharing media you haven't yet uploaded.\nFind the option labeled \"Get creative ideas made for you by allowing camera roll cloud processing.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from continuously uploading media from your camera roll -- and using details like time, location, themes, and the presence of people or objects -- to generate personalized creative ideas such as recaps and AI restylings.\nFAQs\nWhy is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?\nMeta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.\nWhere is this feature being tested?\nMeta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, \"We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll.\"\nThe test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in Illinois or Texas due to those states' privacy laws.\nDid Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?\nMeta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they found the toggles in their settings already switched on by default, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.\nCan I remove my photos once they've been uploaded?\nZDNET's sister site, CNET, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by downloading your Facebook account data.\nWhy is this a potential privacy issue?\nIt expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nEven if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.\nHow many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?\nEditor's note: This article was updated on Aug. 24, 2025 to clarify that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings."

Google's launch of its Pixel 10 Series is no different, with some new features Google hopes might draw in new users from other devices.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nAt its Made by Google event, Google unveiled the new Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and Pixel 10, as well as the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a. Beyond fun new phone colors, better camera systems, and other hardware upgrades, AI is at the core, powered by the new Google Tensor G5 processor.\nThe chipset, co-designed with Google DeepMind, can run Gemini Nano on the device, the engine powering all these new AI experiences. Here's a full round-up of the new AI features and my personal hands-on experiences with each.\n1. Magic Cue\nWhile AI tools like chatbots can be helpful, they require you to context-switch to other tabs, ask your question, go back to whichever window you were originally working out of, and paste it in. In order to upgrade that experience and level up the assistance, AI needs to predict your needs -- which is exactly what Magic Cue aims to do.\nAlso: I tried the standard Google Pixel 10 and didn't miss the Pro models one bit\nThe Magic Cue feature suggests relevant information and actions based on what you're doing. For example, in the demo featured in the image above, the user was calling an airline, so Magic Cue automatically surfaced the flight details to prevent scrambling to find them while on the call.\nIn another demo, the user got a text asking where the reservation was. Instead of the demoer having to find the details, Magic Cue surfaced the reservation information based on what was in the user's inbox. Then, all the user had to do was tap and send it. Since the feature leverages the Google Tensor G5 chip, information is processed locally on the device.\n2. Daily Hub\nSticking with the trend of making information as accessible as possible, the new Daily Hub feature found in your Discover feed puts all of the information you need in one place. It also includes an integration with Magic Cue, which gathers insights from your apps.\nAs seen in the image, it can remind you of actions from your Google Keep and Gmail, including dinner plans, reservations, and flight details. In practice, it is very similar to Samsung's At a Glance feature, just native to the Google experience powering Pixel.\n3. Voice Translate\nOne use case where generative AI really excels is language translation. Because LLMs have a deep grasp of language and how people speak -- including conversational and non-linear speech -- speech translation has gotten a lot more accurate. As a result, many smartphone manufacturers, like Apple, are incorporating AI translation in their own products, and Google unveiled its own.\nWith Voice Translation, you can hear a translation in real time while on a phone call. The most noteworthy part is that it copies the sound of the speaker's voice, making the new audio sound as free-flowing and natural as possible. There is also a really helpful transcript you can follow to help keep track of the dialogue even further.\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but the Google Pixel 10 has me reconsidering my loyalty\nWhen I demoed the feature, I was pleasantly surprised at how quick it was, and most importantly, at how well it copied my voice to make me sound like I was actually speaking German. At rollout, Voice Translate works when translating to or from English with Spanish, German, Japanese, French, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, and Indonesian.\n4. Camera Coach\nA good chunk of the new AI features are focused on elevating your photo-taking and editing experience. The new Camera Coach feature aims to take the guesswork out of taking a photo, using Gemini's multimodal capabilities to help you snap the perfect shot by suggesting angles, lighting, and camera modes.\nBeyond step-by-step instructions, Gemini will even generate a sample image of what you should aim for in the final product. For example, in a demo, the user was trying to take a photo of a plant leaf but had the angle off-center. Gemini generated the image of the leaf positioned correctly, so then all the demoer had to do was match the visual by adjusting his position.\nAlso: Google just copied the worst feature of modern iPhones (but not all hope is lost)\nOne of the features I was most impressed by was Camera Coach's ability to recognize what was being shown in the display, down to the specific location. For example, in the image above, the Camera Coach asked the demoer what they wanted to be shown in the photo by identifying that it was a waterfront view, and that it was Chelsea Piers in New York, alongside the Hudson River.\n5. Edit with Ask Photos\nProducing a good photo is equal parts capturing the right shot and post-production editing to optimize it. However, photo editing can often be tricky (especially if you're inexperienced), as there are so many little tools often used in combination. This new feature allows you to describe the change you want using natural language and have the AI make the changes instantaneously.\nAlso: I tried Pixel Watch 4 - and these are my 7 favorite upgrades in Google's new watch\nFor example, the image at the top of the article was very nicely framed, but it had a distracting glare. Instead of having to find the right tools, you can just say that you'd like to remove the glare, and in a couple of seconds, it's done. Other, more general applications include asking it to \"make it better\" resulted in actions like straightening it out and improving the lighting.\n6. Improved the Add Me feature and Auto Best Take\nWhile the Add Me and Auto Best Take features are not new, Google upgraded them to make them even more helpful. The Add Me feature, which lets people add the photographer to the photo, now works with photos with an even bigger group of people.\nMeanwhile, Auto Best Take automatically finds the best picture in which everyone looks great, where previously you would have had to manually select which ones you wanted to combine.\nBonus: Google AI Pro plan one-year subscription\nGoogle's AI Pro Plan costs $20 per month and packages all of Google's best AI offerings. These include the best models in Gemini and standalone tools, including expanded access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, NotebookLM, Deep Research, Veo 3, and Jules."

      "text": "You can delete sent text messages on Android now - here's how\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Google Messages now lets you delete a sent text message.\n- A deleted message disappears for the other person immediately.\n- The feature is available now for almost all Android users.\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nAndroid users finally have an undo option.\nA long-awaited feature that lets you delete a sent text message is widely rolling out to most Android devices -- provided you use Google Messages as your texting platform.\nAlso: How to clear your Android phone cache (and give it a serious speed boost)\nThe option was first spotted by Android Authority, which also saw signs of the feature as early as February. Google has been slowly rolling out the ability to delete a message for some time, but it's now showing up for most users. The ability to delete a message from your screen has existed for a while, but now you can delete it for everyone involved.\nHow to delete a text message in Google Messages\nYou only have the option to delete a text for everyone if both parties are using RCS messaging. To delete a sent message, long press on it until you see options at the top. Beside the edit button (which rolled out last May), you'll see the new delete option -- a trash can.\nAlso: Android phone feeling slow? How I changed one setting to instantly double the speed\nWhen you tap the trash can icon, you'll see an option to delete for everyone or just for you. If you choose everyone, Google warns, other people may still see the message if they're on older versions of the app that don't support the delete feature. While you only have the option to edit a text for 15 minutes after it's sent, the ability to delete seems permanent (it was still there an hour after I checked while writing this).\nWhen I checked, the feature was available on my Pixel 9 Pro and my wife's Pixel 9a. I tried sending a text and then deleting it, and it disappeared from my wife's phone almost instantly. Like Facebook Messenger, there is a \"message deleted\" notification, but no indication of what it said.\nAlso: I changed 12 settings on my Android phone to instantly extend the battery life\nThis ability won't let you take back a late-night text you regret the next morning, but it will let you undo something said in the heat of the moment or an accidental send. It might seem like a small tweak, but it's good to see Google catch up with the competition. Both iMessage and WhatsApp have had delete options for years now, and if Messages wants to stay relevant, it has to stay modern."

      "text": "10 open-source apps I recommend every Windows user download - for free\nFollow ZDNET: Make it a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- If Windows is your OS of choice, consider these open-source apps.\n- There are tons of open-source apps for just about any task.\n- These are all free to install and use on Windows.\nI've been using open-source software for a very long time. In fact, the last time I didn't use open-source software, Bill Clinton was president of the US.\nOpen-source software is available for nearly every operating system on the market, from desktops to phones, and I often find open-source apps are superior to their proprietary counterparts. If you're a Windows user, you don't have to remain locked into closed-source software, because there are so many alternatives from which you can choose.\nAlso: Want to ditch Windows? This Linux distro makes that transition easy\nLet me introduce you to some of my favorites.\n1. LibreOffice\nLibreOffice has been my go-to office suite since way back when it was a twinkle in the eye of StarOffice, and I haven't looked back since. LibreOffice includes all the tools you're used to in an office suite and even includes a database component (similar to MS Access). And with a customizable user interface, you can work with a modern UI or one that recalls the days of yore.\nAlso: 6 ways LibreOffice is better than Google Docs for serious writing work\nLibreOffice is installed locally, so you don't have to worry about a third-party cloud service accessing your information. You can set LibreOffice to automatically save in the MS Office default formats, so collaborating with those using Microsoft's tool is a no-brainer.\nLibreOffice is free to download and install for Windows.\n2. Flow Launcher\nFlow Launcher is a quick file search and app launcher for Windows. With Flow Launcher, you use a customizable hot key to launch the tool and then search for whatever it is you're looking for. You can open apps, search for files, and browse the internet with your default search engine. Flow Launcher includes themes, animations, and sounds, and even allows you to build your own customizations. There are also community-created plugins to extend the feature set.\nAlso: Can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options - and 2 months to decide\nFlow Launcher is free to download and install.\n3. Duplicati\nDuplicati is a zero-trust backup solution that can back up from Windows (or any OS) to any destination you need. You can back up to Dropbox, Box, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services, or you can back up to other machines on your LAN for more privacy. Duplicati allows for scheduling and remote management, and it has a straightforward installation. Your backups are fully encrypted, and you can easily monitor them for real-time insights via a well-designed dashboard.\nAlso: Your Windows PC has a secretly useful backup tool - here's how to access it\nDuplicati is free for personal use.\n4. Nextcloud\nIf you're tired of using Google or Microsoft's cloud-based offerings (especially out of fear that they are using your data to train LLMs), there's always Nextcloud, which is the open-source, locally run equivalent to cloud offerings. Nextcloud includes everything you need for file storage, sharing, collaborating, communicating, organizing, and more. There's also an app store where you can install plugins to extend the feature set.\nAlso: The best cloud storage services of 2025: Expert tested\nYou can install and use Nextcloud on Windows for free and even install the Nextcloud Desktop client for even easier usage.\n5. Franz\nIf you use several messaging apps and services, you might want to consider Franz, as it brings all of those messaging apps into one user-friendly GUI. Franz allows you to add WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Google Calendar, Discord, LinkedIn, Trello, Office 365 Outlook, Google Keep, and more together, so you don't have to switch back and forth between apps. You can add as many accounts as you want and easily switch between them without leaving the Franz UI.\nAlso: 5 tools I trust to keep my online conversations private and anonymous\nFranz is free to install and use.\n6. YAZB\nYAZB (aka YAZB Reborn) makes it possible to create custom Windows top bars (similar to that of MacOS) that can display helpful system information, such as battery status, internet speeds, weather, and more -- all with a clean, minimal, elegant style.\nAlso: How much RAM does your PC really need in 2025? I did the math for Windows and Mac users\nYAZB also gives you quick access to shutdown/restart controls, customizable themes/icons/layouts, and allows you to add as many helpful widgets as you need.\n7. File Converter\nIf you've ever needed to easily convert or compress a file in Windows, File Converter has your back. Using a right-click context menu entry (within the file manager), you can convert audio, video, images, and documents from one format to another. In the case of documents, you can convert nearly any format into a PDF. You can also compress files in the same way.\nAlso: How to upgrade an 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - 2 free options\nThe only caveat is that, in order to convert MS Office files, you'll have to have MS Office installed. You can customize the application order within the context menu and even add or remove presets.\nFile Converter is free to install and use on Windows.\n8. Bitwarden\nIf you don't use a password manager, you should start immediately. If you need a password manager, you should place Bitwarden at the top of your list. Not only is Bitwarden open-source, but it's also one of the best password managers on the market.\nWith every feature you'll need (including a web browser extension), Bitwarden can do more to help keep you protected by simplifying the process of using strong, unique passwords. This open-source password manager includes a password generator (that can do both passwords and pass phrases), Bitwarden Send (to send files and text safely), and more.\nAlso: NordPass vs. Bitwarden: Which password manager is best?\nBitwarden can be installed and used for free on Windows. You might even consider purchasing a license, as it gives you more collaboration features, which can come in handy with a large family or organization.\n9. AutoHotKey\nAutoHotKey is an automation scripting language for Windows that allows you to define hotkeys for both mouse and keyboard, remap keys or buttons, and more. With AutoHotKey, you can automate just about any desktop task.\nAlso: 5 free Windows PC apps I always install first (and how they improve your workflow)\nEssentially, this app makes it easy to work with hotkeys and macros, while helping you work more efficiently. There is a learning curve to AutoHotKey, but once you've learned it, you'll be glad you took the time to do so.\nAutoHotKey can be installed and used for free on Windows.\n10. Ollama\nIf you want to use AI but don't like the idea of a third party using your queries or data to train their LLMs, consider the open-source Ollama, which is easy to use and even includes a well-designed GUI for interacting and adding models.\nAlso: This is the fastest local AI I've tried, and it's not even close - how to get it\nWith Ollama, you can work with a large selection of models, ranging from the tiny to the very large. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the larger the model, the more system resources it will require. You would also be best served by using Ollama on a Windows machine with a dedicated GPU.\nOllama can be installed and used for free on Windows."

  "argos_summary": "The author explains why the Pixel\u202f10 isn\u2019t worth upgrading from the Pixel\u202f9 Pro: the price is high, the hardware and design changes are minimal, and the new AI features feel intrusive rather than useful. The Pixel\u202f10\u2019s color palette is limited, and the added Pixelsnap magnetic charging accessory is unnecessary for those already using a case. Despite Google\u2019s push for AI, the author prefers the familiar performance and aesthetics of the Pixel\u202f9 Pro and plans to keep it until a more compelling flagship emerges.",
