      "feedback": "The draft mixes three unrelated macro narratives (Fed‑crypto, Brazil soy, AI‑UBI) with sector‑level consumer staples, gaming, and auto commentary, diluting focus and inflating the word count beyond the 4–6 sentence limit. Tighten the house view by (1) selecting a single coherent macro driver—e.g., Fed‑rate cuts narrowing Δr—and linking it directly to crypto, commodity, and fiscal outcomes, then (2) summarizing the consumer‑staples case in one bullet that quantifies the tax‑cut lift (0.5–1.0 % per‑capita spending) and margin risk (Fed hike > 0.25 % → –0.3 % disposable income). Drop the AI‑UBI and Brazil moratorium anchors unless they materially alter the Fed cycle; if kept, present them as secondary “risk‑on” catalysts with clear thresholds. Replace generic statements (“crypto channels institutional capital”) with concrete numbers (e.g., Ether’s $4,954.81 ATH, 25 % high‑automation risk). Consolidate watch items into a single list, citing only the most relevant IDs (OGK8WLL69, J54PXL0NV, NL5YYTLF2, EPJYXB7DX, ILYC1M41F). Ensure every claim is backed by a source ID and that conflicting data are reconciled (e.g., if J54PXL0NV shows soy price rise, explicitly note the 97 Mt shipment figure). Finally, rewrite the conclusion as 4–6 crisp sentences: (i) Base case: Fed easing, tax‑cut bill, Walmart margin stability, Switch 2 sales > 1.8 M, oil mid‑60s → +1–2 % risk‑asset rally; (ii) Risks: Fed cuts stall, moratorium repeal, AI‑driven UBI → Fed tightening; (iii) Watch: Fed minutes, Powell remarks, Brazil court ruling, Trump troop updates, Switch 2 sales; (iv) Confidence: 0.75. This will deliver a concise, data‑driven, decision‑useful brief.",
