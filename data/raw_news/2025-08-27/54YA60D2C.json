  "title": "5 Bridal Fashion Trends of 2025 Every Plus Size Bride Can Rock",
  "description": "Bridal fashion in 2025 is all about confidence. From bold sleeves to sleek tailoring, these trends give plus size brides styles worth celebrating.",
  "content": "LA Times Studios may earn commission from purchases made through our links.\n\nStep into any bridal salon in 2025 and you\u2019ll immediately feel it: fashion is shifting. No longer is the industry whispering about inclusivity. It\u2019s finally starting to celebrate it.\n\nThe best part? The season\u2019s hottest trends are not just runway ready they\u2019re curve ready. As a plus size bridal expert who\u2019s spent years reminding women that visibility is power I can confidently say: these five trends were made for us too.\n\nGone are the days when \u201cminimalist\u201d meant \u201cboring.\u201d This year\u2019s version of minimalism is all about luxe fabrics, fluid draping and quiet sophistication. Imagine a sleek silk slip with just the right sheen or a structured satin gown with clean lines that let your beauty do the talking.\n\nWhy it works for plus-size brides:\n\nMinimalist gowns create a timeless silhouette without the fuss. They skim instead of squeeze, they flow instead of fight and that kind of effortless confidence never goes out of style.\n\nSleeves are stealing the spotlight in 2025. Think dramatic balloon sleeves, soft bishop shapes and delicate flutter designs that move like poetry. They\u2019re equal parts romantic and fashion-forward.\n\nWhy it works for plus-size brides:\n\nSleeves balance proportions beautifully, add movement and create that \u201cwow\u201d factor without needing a single sequin. Bonus: they give you the option of coverage without compromising on style.\n\nBest Wedding Dress Silhouettes for Plus Size Brides\n\nThe drop waist is back\u2014and she\u2019s looking better than ever. Basque waists (the ones that dip into a V below your natural waist) are also making a strong comeback, offering a nod to vintage glamour. Both styles elongate the body and spotlight curves in the most flattering way.\n\nWhy it works for plus-size brides:\n\nThese silhouettes sculpt the body without cinching it uncomfortably. They highlight hips, create length and serve major romance with a modern edge.\n\nIf \u201cextra\u201d is your love language, this is your trend. From 3D floral appliqu\u00e9s to brocade, pearls and beaded detailing, 2025 gowns are embracing texture in all its glory. The key is balance: pair ornate embellishments with sleek silhouettes and you get art-meets-elegance magic.\n\nWhy it works for plus-size brides:\n\nTextures and details catch the light, draw the eye and celebrate your body instead of concealing it. They add depth, dimension and a level of luxury that feels powerful.\n\nWhy settle for one look when you can have two (or three)? Detachable skirts, overskirts, capes and removable sleeves let brides transform their look throughout the day. Walk down the aisle in full drama then dance the night away in something lighter, all without a full outfit change.\n\nWhy it works for plus-size brides:\n\nAdaptability means comfort and comfort means confidence. You can keep the structured glam for your ceremony and shed layers for your reception. It\u2019s fashion that moves with you not against you.\n\nMore Than Just Bridal Trends\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: trends come and go but feeling seen and celebrated never goes out of style. These 2025 bridal fashion trends aren\u2019t about squeezing into an unrealistic mold they\u2019re about expanding the vision of what beauty looks like when love walks down the aisle.\n\nAs a plus size bride myself, I know what it feels like to walk into a bridal salon and not see yourself reflected back. But this year\u2019s trends tell a different story. They say: you belong here. You are the moment. And your gown should be as unforgettable as the love story it\u2019s honoring.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, whether it\u2019s minimalist satin, billowing sleeves or a cape that comes off when the DJ turns up the bass, the most important trend will always be you showing up, unapologetically, in all your bridal glory.",

      "text": "These Trends Are Defining Bridal Style In 2025\n- Share via\nIf you\u2019ve ever started researching wedding dresses, you know how quickly the endeavor can get overwhelming. There are so many options\u2014satin vs. lace, minimalist vs. maximalist, ball gown vs. sheath\u2014and it feels like the trends change every time you refresh your feed. One minute it\u2019s all about clean lines and subtle silhouettes, the next it\u2019s corsets and drama and ten-foot trains.\nWhile personal style always comes first, knowing what\u2019s trending can actually help narrow the options and spark ideas you hadn\u2019t considered. To make sense of what\u2019s ahead for 2025 brides, I asked two industry insiders for the trends they\u2019re seeing on the runway and in their showrooms.\nDorothy Silver, Director of Merchandising at Kleinfeld Bridal, and Christina Blanchette, VP of Sales and Marketing at Maggie Sottero, shared what\u2019s in, what\u2019s evolving, and what brides are asking for right now.\nBasque and Dropped Waists Are Making a Comeback\u2014But Softer Than Before\nWaistlines are shifting\u2014literally. Basque waists, known for their signature V-shape that dips below the natural waistline, are showing up in new collections but with a twist. \u201cBasque waists are getting softer at the waist instead of coming to a sharp point,\u201d Silver says. \u201cBrides are leaning into this silhouette due to its elongated, flattering look.\u201d\nBall Gowns Aren\u2019t Going Anywhere\nSome silhouettes are just timeless. According to Silver, \u201cBall gown is the number one silhouette for today\u2019s bride and will remain at the forefront for fashion-savvy brides.\u201d\nBlanchette echoes that sentiment, adding that ballgowns are \u201cmaking a resurgence, especially with dramatic skirts and structured corsetry.\u201d Designers are leaning into volume, architectural lines, and bold fabrics to give this classic silhouette a modern edge.\nWith their fitted bodices and sweeping skirts, ball gowns still hold that fairytale appeal\u2014but the 2025 versions feel bolder, cleaner, and far more customizable than the princess gowns of the past.\nA-Line and Sheath Styles Stay Strong for 2025\nWhile ball gowns bring drama, A-line and sheath silhouettes are offering something a little more low-key\u2014and just as stylish. \u201cA-line gowns remain a top choice for their universally flattering fit,\u201d says Blanchette. Sheath dresses are also getting a lot of love for their clean, tailored look. \u201cThey\u2019re trending for their modern, minimalist appeal,\u201d she adds.\nThese cuts work across a range of styles\u2014from classic to contemporary\u2014and are perfect for brides who want something elegant but unfussy. They also tend to be easier to move in, which makes them a smart pick for outdoor ceremonies or more laid-back venues.\nCorsets Are Having a Moment\nCorsetry is back in a big way, and not just for period-drama fans. \u201cCorsets are also making a comeback due to the rise in popularity of the Bridgerton-esque trend along with the red-carpet celebrity trends,\u201d Silver explains.\nBeyond aesthetics, brides love the way a corset shapes the torso and gives structure to a dress without sacrificing comfort. Millie Bobby Brown tapped into this look with one of her multiple wedding dresses\u2014a custom Galia Lahav gown featuring a lace-up corset bodice and delicate straps. It struck the perfect balance between romantic and modern.\nFabrics Are Getting More Creative\nTexture and detail are playing a big role in 2025 collections. Silver points to jacquard fabrics and hand-painted textiles as trending choices\u2014both of which offer visual interest without relying on heavy embellishment.\nBlanchette is seeing similar movement. \u201cSoft, draped fabrics like crepe and satin are trending for their effortless elegance,\u201d she says. \u201cTulle and organza add a touch of romance and volume,\u201d while lace is evolving with \u201c3D floral appliqu\u00e9s and embroidered details for added texture.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also a growing interest in sustainable materials, reflecting the demand for more eco-conscious bridal fashion.\nCelebrities Are Still Driving Bridal Style\nRed carpet fashion continues to shape what brides are drawn to, whether consciously or not. \u201cWhen the bride walks down the aisle, she wants that red carpet feeling,\u201d Silver says.\nFrom large bows to feather accents, plunging necklines, and dramatic ruffles, bridal designers are borrowing directly from Hollywood. Blanchette notes that oversized bows are especially popular right now. \u201cThey\u2019re having a major moment, adding a bold, fashion-forward touch that\u2019s perfect for the cool-girl bride,\u201d she says.\nIf you caught Rita Ora\u2019s wedding look\u2014an ivory Tom Ford gown with a dramatic sheer panel and bow detail\u2014you know just how impactful those little accents can be.\nAccessories Are Stepping into the Spotlight\nWhile veils will always have their place, other accessories are gaining ground. According to Silver, chiffon scarves are emerging as a modern alternative: \u201cSoft chiffon flowing scarves are replacing the traditional veil. To make a statement on your big day, I suggest a soft scarf around the neck and cascading to the floor.\u201d\nGloves are back too\u2014especially opera-length in lace or sheer fabrics. Paired with a lace choker that mirrors the bodice of the dress, they offer a coordinated and high-fashion twist on bridal tradition. Blanchette also points to detachable sleeves and gloves as smart, versatile options. They let brides transition from ceremony to reception without a full outfit change."

      "text": "How to Keep Your Wedding Dance Floor Packed All Night\n- Share via\nA packed dance floor is the hallmark of a successful wedding reception. It\u2019s the place where generations connect, friends let loose and the celebration comes to life. But keeping guests on their feet all night doesn\u2019t happen by accident. It\u2019s the result of thoughtful planning, smart design choices and a little strategy.\nHere are some do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to guide your planning if you\u2019re hoping for a packed dance floor.\nLead by Example\nYour guests will take their cues from you. If you and your partner are out on the dance floor then they will follow. Make your rounds during cocktail hour or dinner so you can focus on dancing once the music starts.\nLimit Outfit Changes\nWhile second looks are enticing, disappearing for a change can take you out of the celebration for 20 to 30 minutes. That absence shifts the energy, often just when the party is hitting its stride. If you want to change, consider waiting until later in the evening or choose something that can be slipped on quickly without a long break in the festivities.\nKeep the Bars Close\nPlace a bar or two near the dance floor. Guests are more likely to refill quickly and return if they don\u2019t have to wander across the venue or into another space for a drink. The closer the bar, the more consistently full the dance floor will be.\nDon\u2019t Let Dinner Drag On\nA drawn-out, multi-course dinner may be elegant but it can dull the momentum. If you want a true dance party, coordinate with your caterer to serve efficiently or break up dinner with short dance sets between courses. Otherwise, your band or DJ will face an uphill battle to recapture the energy after dinner.\nLimit Competing Attractions\nPhoto booths, cigar lounges and tequila tasting all have their place. Yet every activity pulls attention away from the dance floor. If dancing is your priority, stick to one additional element. Save the rest for larger guest counts or celebrations where dancing isn\u2019t the main goal.\nPlan Band Breaks Strategically\nBands need breaks but timing is everything. Breaks should ideally happen during dinner or cake cutting, not during peak dancing moments. If that\u2019s not possible, ask your band to prepare high-energy break music. Or better yet, bring in a DJ to keep the flow going.\nTrust the Professionals\nIt\u2019s natural to want input on the playlist, but the most successful parties balance your taste with your entertainers\u2019 expertise. DJs and bands are trained to read the crowd. If a song isn\u2019t working, they need to have the ability to switch gears instantly to keep the dance floor alive.\nDesign for Flow\nPlace lounge seating and cocktail tables close to the dance floor. This gives guests a spot to rest without retreating to another part of the venue. The easier it is for them to pop back up when a favorite song plays, the more consistent your dance floor will be.\nTime the Cake Cutting\nTraditionally, guests see cake cutting as the signal that the night is winding down. Schedule it later in the evening so guests don\u2019t slip away too soon. And don\u2019t be afraid to adjust the timing of this formality. If the dance floor is thriving, wait. If the energy has dipped, cut the cake early to reset the vibe.\nServe Snacks on the Dance Floor\nLate-night snacks are a favorite touch. But announcing a food truck before the end of the night can empty your dance floor. Instead, pass snacks directly on the dance floor to keep people dancing or save the food truck as a fun farewell surprise when guests are leaving the venue.\nThe Takeaway\nA packed dance floor is less about chance and more about intention. By anticipating your guests\u2019 needs and keeping the celebration centered around the music, you\u2019ll set the stage for the kind of high-energy, joy-filled night everyone remembers."

      "text": "First Look: The Unveiled Heart Collection by Selkie\n- Share via\nDesigning wedding gowns has always been part of Kimberley Gordon\u2019s story. \u201cEven at the age of 12 I was sketching from bridal magazines,\u201d the founder and creative director of Selkie says. With the newest collection called Unveiled Heart, Selkie leans further into bridal couture. The focus is on meeting brides where they are. Smaller weddings, more personal aesthetics. Ceremonies in backyards or courthouses. Moments that are about intimacy instead of spectacle.\nThe idea started when Gordon saw how many brides were choosing Selkie\u2019s Waltz gown. \u201cThese weddings felt private, deeply meaningful and less about grandiosity,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThey celebrated the couple themselves, their connection. Their personalities. That sparked this collection, Unveiled Heart.\u201d The name is a nod to the intimacy of romance novels and the vulnerability of showing your heart to one person.\nThe gowns are shaped for brides who want beauty that feels easy and natural. Gordon says she thought of early 20th century weddings. Homemade cakes, cotton dresses, simple celebrations. These new gowns carry that ease but still provide a sense of volume and drama.\nSeveral designs reach back to history for inspiration. The Antoinette gown first appeared on Selkie\u2019s Fall Libertine runway. Its corseted bodice and cotton fabric were drawn from Marie Antoinette\u2019s simpler dresses at Petit Trianon, when she would escape court life for something lighter. The Degas gown looks to the ballerinas of that era, their elegance and movement. Then there\u2019s Cupid, introduced around Valentine\u2019s Day. \u201cIt has a playful, romantic feel,\u201d Gordon explains. \u201cIt\u2019s full of frills and channels a 1990s shabby chic vibe, reminiscent of Pamela Anderson.\u201d\nFreedom is the idea at the center of the collection. Gordon doesn\u2019t want brides boxed in by trends or pressured into gowns that don\u2019t feel like them. \u201cMany brides tend to choose gowns based on body type or current trends, rather than reflecting who they are as people,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re less about trends and more about celebrating romantic periods, romantic ideas, and ultimately identity.\u201d She wants dresses that let brides laugh and dance. Maybe even jump in the ocean at the end of the night. \u201cOur gowns are made to tug at the heartstrings and make you feel amazing, but in a way that\u2019s practical and fun.\u201d\nAccessibility is another factor in the designs. Every gown is offered up to size 6X. Gordon and her team design with different body shapes in mind from the very start. \u201cWe really think through how different bodies will move and feel in a gown,\u201d she explains. How fabric falls, how a corset rests on larger busts, how a dress can skim hips without losing comfort. \u201cThis is such a special moment in a person\u2019s life, and we want to be there for them,\u201d says Gordon, \u201cYour body size isn\u2019t offensive, and it shouldn\u2019t ever be treated as such.\u201d\nUnveiled Heart is romantic and pragmatic. A reminder that bridal fashion doesn\u2019t need to be extravagant to feel extraordinary.\nAbout Selkie\nFounded in 2018, Selkie is a Los Angeles fashion house built around whimsy, romance and inclusivity. The brand became known for its voluminous Puff Dress and has since expanded into ready-to-wear, occasion and now bridal. Gordon\u2019s designs pull from history and fantasy but are made for the present, offering playful elegance in a size range that runs through 6X. At its core Selkie is about joy, imagination and making beauty available to everyone.\nClick here for more information on Selkie"

      "text": "\u201cHuzzah!\u201d is the Word: Hayley Paige on Reclaiming Her Name and Her Voice\n- Share via\nThe name Hayley Paige is synonymous with whimsical, ethereal bridal gowns. But for years the designer was silenced as her name was locked in a public legal battle that threatened to erase the creative legacy she built. Now with the rights to her name reclaimed and a stunning new collection, Hayley Paige is back, more resilient than ever.\nContributor Dee Lee sat down with her to discuss her creative resurrection, the journey of rebuilding and what it means to truly own your voice. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nQ: You\u2019ve been through a highly public legal battle. What does it feel like to reclaim your name and return to the bridal world on your own terms?\nLiberating and joyful, with a little bit of nostalgia. Part of me feels like I just opened a time capsule, and another part feels like I\u2019m running wild because someone finally left the gate open. I\u2019m grateful for the hard stuff. It showed me what I\u2019m made of and what still needs work.\nBut what really stayed steady through all of it were the two best parts of this job: the craft and the community. That creative muscle never really went away, and the people who stuck by me reminded me that this world would welcome me back. That means everything to me, and it\u2019s something I don\u2019t take lightly. At the end of the day, what more could a designer ask for?\nQ: Your designs have always embodied a mix of whimsy, structure, and statement. How has your creative vision evolved through this chapter of reinvention?\nBridal fashion lives at the intersection of your love story and your unique personality. What\u2019s changed for me through all this is my tolerance for challenges and my willingness to pivot when things don\u2019t go as planned. I still lean into imagination and fantasy. That\u2019ll always be my happy place. But now there\u2019s more backbone in the silhouettes and a quiet defiance woven into the process.\nMore than anything, keeping a sense of humor about it all has been key. I design around three touchpoints: sentimentality, playfulness, and a little something unexpected. To me, that\u2019s what turns a loving art form into something experiential, something tangible that not only connects you to someone else, but celebrates all the multitudes of who you are.\nQ: Was there one gown in this new collection that felt like a personal \u201cI\u2019m back\u201d moment?\nDesigning this first collection has been emotional in all the best ways. I wanted to stay true to the signature Hayley Paige DNA while weaving in everything I\u2019ve learned. More growth, more gumption.\nOne dress in particular actually brought me to tears: an ombr\u00e9 tiered tulle ballgown we named After the Storm. She\u2019s made of ten different shades of tulle, reminiscent of a rainbow. To me, she captures an entire chapter of my life. It\u2019s a love letter to reinvention. She\u2019s a prism and a roar at the same time, a beautiful reminder that your story doesn\u2019t end just because someone else tries to close the book.\nQ: How did you stay creatively fueled during the years you couldn\u2019t design under your own name?\nThat chapter taught me how important it is to keep learning. To stay a student of life and design. During that time, I studied shoe and handbag design because it felt creatively fulfilling but noncompetitive, and I threw myself into learning the nuts and bolts of building a small business.\nI kept my body moving too. Long walks and workouts became my way of feeling productive when everything else felt stuck.\nMost importantly, I kept creating. I sketched gowns in the quiet, unseen hours, not for an audience, not performatively, but just for the love of it. And it reminded me why I fell for this craft in the first place.\nDistractions can kill creativity. Lawsuits can kill dreams. You have to find a way to stay imaginative and resourceful, even when the canvas feels small. That time forced me to find beauty in unlikely places, which is really what great design and expression has always been about.\nQ: If you could sum up your comeback in one word, or one headline, what would it be?\nCan I say \u201chuzzah\u201d? Because honestly? It\u2019s the kind of huzzah you say when you\u2019ve crawled through the weeds, learned more than you thought you could handle, and finally get to laugh and exhale. It\u2019s not naive or over-the-top. It\u2019s knowing, grateful, and a little cheeky. But still\u2026 huzzah.\nQ: What bridal trends are you loving right now and which ones are you ready to leave behind?\nI love a bride who picks a gown that feels personal, not just what\u2019s \u201cin.\u201d Give me playful textures, hidden meanings, pearl embellishments, and color any day. I\u2019m also here for the \u201cmini\u201d moment. Brides who change into a short dress for the happily-ever-after party always look like they\u2019re having the most fun.\nWhat trend am I ready to retire? The whole \u201cdress for your body shape\u201d nonsense. That really frosts my cookies. No bride should feel boxed in by some made-up rules about proportions. The gown is meant to fit you and be tailored to your shape, not the other way around."

      "text": "I Wasn\u2019t Supposed to Be a Bride\u2014So I Became the Voice for Brides Like Me\n- Share via\nI didn\u2019t set out to disrupt the wedding industry\u2026..I set out to transform it.\nI was planning my wedding in 2004, filled with all the anticipation and excitement every bride dreams of. I imagined the moment I\u2019d slip into the dress, flip through magazines for inspiration, and finally see my love story reflected in glossy spreads and picture perfect planning boards.\nBut what I found instead was absence.\nEverywhere I looked: bridal magazines, designer lookbooks, Pinterest boards\u2014I saw a singular kind of bride. Thin. White. Able-bodied. Conventionally beautiful. I searched for someone who looked like me: a plus-size Black woman. And she simply wasn\u2019t there.\nIt hit me hard. That euphoric bridal bubble burst quickly, replaced with the sharp sting of invisibility. The message was clear: I wasn\u2019t what a \u201creal bride\u201d looked like. And if I wanted to exist in the wedding industry, I\u2019d have to create space for myself and for millions of other women who had also been left out of the frame.\nSo, I did.\nIn 2011, I founded Pretty Pear Bride, the first wedding publication dedicated exclusively to plus-size brides. It began as a small blog fueled by frustration, but it grew into something much bigger: a movement. For the first time, curvy women could see themselves celebrated in bridal gowns, real weddings, styled shoots, and love stories. I wasn\u2019t just publishing content, I was carving out a long-overdue space for our joy, our style, our love.\nThe State of Plus-Size Bridal: Then and Now\nThe wedding industry has long been a mirror for societal beauty standards and for far too long, it reflected only one kind of body. The average U.S. woman wears a size 14 - 16, yet most bridal salons still only carry sample sizes in 8, 10, or 12. Brides above that range are told to \u201cimagine the fit,\u201d stand in shame under the judgmental gaze of store attendants, or worse, walk away feeling like they don\u2019t belong in the dress, or the moment.\nI\u2019ve heard it all:\n\u201cIt costs more to produce plus sizes.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too hard to design for curvier bodies.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not enough demand.\u201d\nLet\u2019s be clear, the demand has always been there. What\u2019s been missing, is the willingness to serve us with the same creativity, respect, and visibility granted to straight-size brides.\nDesigners often treat inclusive sizing as an afterthought or a seasonal PR tactic, releasing a single gown in a few extended sizes and calling it progress. Meanwhile, bridal magazines and blogs still overwhelmingly feature thin, white-bodied women. The bridal mainstream continues to sell one vision of love and beauty, utterly excluding those of us who\u2019ve been here all along.\nBut the truth is, we\u2019re not asking to be included\u2014we\u2019re now demanding it.\nBuilding What Didn\u2019t Exist\nWhen I started Pretty Pear Bride, I wasn\u2019t a tech-savvy media mogul. I was a former teacher, medical technologist, a newlywed, and a frustrated bride who was tired of waiting for permission. But I knew that representation wasn\u2019t just about being seen, it was about being centered and actually wanting to be seen.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what I did.\nWe created a platform where plus-size brides could show up fully and confidently. Not as a token or a special feature, but as the stars. From bold editorial fashion shoots to heartfelt real weddings, Pretty Pear Bride became the go-to destination for curvy brides who had long been told to shrink themselves to fit in. We flipped that script and said: You belong here, exactly as you are.\nThe impact was immediate.\nMessages poured in from women around the world:\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see someone my size look beautiful in a wedding dress\u2014until now.\u201d \u201cYou made me feel like I deserve to be celebrated too.\u201d\n\u201cI showed your blog to my mom so she\u2019d understand what I want on my wedding day.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t just a blog anymore. It was a lifeline.\nAisle Society and the Power of Visibility\nOver time, my work expanded beyond plus-size representation into a broader mission of wedding media disruption.\nIn 2020, I became the new steward of Aisle Society\u2014the largest collective of wedding publications in the world. And with that platform came power\u2014and responsibility. As the first plus-size Black woman to lead this global media collective, I saw an opportunity to rewrite the narrative of who gets to be visible, valued, and celebrated in the wedding world.\nI believe love stories should look like the world we actually live in: diverse, inclusive, intersectional, and authentic.\nAt Aisle Society, we\u2019re not just curating weddings\u2014we\u2019re reshaping culture. We\u2019re lifting up marginalized voices, platforming inclusive brands, and helping couples of all sizes, genders, and backgrounds feel seen in the wedding media they consume.\nThe wedding industry can no longer claim to be \u201caspirational\u201d if it only aspires to one kind of beauty. My job is to ensure every kind of couple, every kind of bride, and every kind of love has a place at the table\u2014and in the spotlight.\nThe Power of Showing Up\nWhat I\u2019ve learned through all of this is that my work is not just about fashion or media\u2014it\u2019s about representation as an act of love and liberation.\nWhen we allow plus-size brides to see themselves reflected in wedding media, we\u2019re telling them: You are worthy of this joy. You are allowed to take up space. You deserve to be the center of attention. That is radical. That is healing. And that is the power of showing up in our fullness.\nIt\u2019s why this new role, as the plus-size bridal contributor for LA Times Studios is such a profound honor. Because I\u2019m not just writing about weddings. I\u2019m writing about identity, visibility, and joy for people who have spent their entire lives being told they don\u2019t fit the mold.\nTo the Brides Who\u2019ve Been Left Out\nIf you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019ve ever walked into a bridal boutique only to be met with silence, stares, or shame, please know this: you are not the problem.\nIf you\u2019ve ever looked through a wedding magazine and thought, \u201cNo one here looks like me,\u201d you\u2019re not imagining it. The exclusion is real.\nIf you\u2019ve been told to lose weight, cover your arms, or skip the strapless dress\u2014ignore them. There is nothing wrong with your body.\nYou are a bride. You are beautiful. You are worthy.\nYou deserve to celebrate your love story exactly as you are\u2014no compromises, no conditions.\nWhat Comes Next\nThe wedding industry is at a crossroads. We can either continue recycling narrow ideals of love and beauty or we can build something better.\nI choose better. And I\u2019m inviting you to join me.\nAs I step into this new chapter\u2014continuing to lead Pretty Pear Bride and expand Aisle Society, I remain fiercely committed to one truth: the future of weddings is inclusive.\nIt\u2019s not just about size, it\u2019s about race, gender identity, age, disability, neurodiversity, and love in all its forms. It\u2019s about building a world where every couple sees themselves not just as possible, but as powerful.\nSo no, I didn\u2019t set out to disrupt the wedding industry. I set out to transform it. And 14 years later, I\u2019m still just getting started."

      "text": "Weddings Are Having a Main Character Moment\n- Share via\nLet\u2019s be honest. Weddings have always had a flair for the dramatic. But in 2025 that flair comes with a director, a mood board and probably a scene-by-scene breakdown. Couples aren\u2019t just planning a ceremony, they\u2019re producing an experience. We\u2019re officially in the made-for-streaming era of weddings.\nHow Pop Culture Is Shaping Modern Wedding Themes\nPop culture isn\u2019t just showing up in the reception playlist anymore. It\u2019s shaping the entire vibe. Whether the energy is romantic, moody, regal or bold, today\u2019s weddings feel more like a fully developed storyline than a one-day event. I\u2019ve seen mood boards with lighting cues, wardrobe notes and playlists labeled \u201cAct I\u201d through \u201cFinale.\u201d Couples aren\u2019t recreating specific movies, but they\u2019re definitely pulling from the same creative playbook.\nBridgerton Wedding Inspiration: A Return to Garden Opulence\nLet\u2019s start with Bridgerton. That show kicked off a full-blown return to garden opulence: overgrown florals, embroidered linens, pastel palettes and string quartets playing SZA. It\u2019s maximalism with a wink. Romantic, styled and intentionally over-the-top in a way that feels less like a theme and more like a fantasy brought to life.\nEuphoria Wedding After-Party Ideas\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum? Euphoria-inspired after-parties. These aren\u2019t your typical reception wind-downs. We\u2019re talking bold lighting, glitter bars, vinyl DJs and second looks that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a music video. The dance floor doesn\u2019t just open. It makes an entrance.\nModern Great Gatsby Wedding Ideas: Roaring \u201920s Reinvented\nThen there\u2019s The Great Gatsby. It never really went out of style, but couples are giving it a fresh take. Less flapper, more elevated indulgence. Think blackout lighting, mirrored bars, metallic fringe ceilings and champagne towers that never go out of style. It\u2019s a modern Roaring \u201920s moment: sharp, jazzy, and ready for its close-up.\nHonoring Heritage: Coming to America Wedding Influence\nNow let\u2019s talk about Coming to America. One of my all-time favorites. The cultural impact? Unmatched. I\u2019ve seen couples draw from the joy and power of that iconic wedding scene\u2014gold accents, African drumming, bold custom fashion and entrances that feel like coronations. For many, this isn\u2019t about creating a theme. It\u2019s about honoring heritage with presence and pride.\nWedding Style Trends 2025: Personalized Fashion and Immersive Design\nYes, the fashion is rising to meet the moment. Brides are going for sculptural gowns, gloves, capes and color. Some are pulling second looks from vintage dealers or layering heirloom jewelry into modern silhouettes. Grooms are stepping up too with velvet tuxedos, monochromatic looks, and pearls. The black tux isn\u2019t gone, but it\u2019s definitely not the only option anymore.\nEven the planning process has shifted. We used to build color palettes. Now we\u2019re building worlds. Couples are referencing film lighting, album visuals editorial shoots, and anything that helps create a wedding that feels layered and personal. It\u2019s not about replicating a storyline. It\u2019s about matching the mood.\nThe Heart of 2025 Weddings: Intention and Personal Expression\nThe common thread in all of this? Intention and personality. Today\u2019s weddings are about showing up fully. Not just in style, but in emotion and detail. Couples want their day to feel personal, expressive and immersive. And if that means borrowing a little screen magic to bring it to life? Even better."

We are beyond thrilled to share the official runway photos from the Hayley Paige \u201cTwice Upon a Time\u201d presentation, an extraordinary debut held at the legendary Colony Hotel in picture-perfect Palm Beach, Florida.\nPlanned and designed by Whitney Carillon Events and captured flawlessly by La Via Visual, this soir\u00e9e was a rewritten chapter for Hayley Paige. A whimsical dreamscape of bold storytelling, couture fantasy, and next-generation bridal design that marked a long-awaited return\u2026 and a reckoning.\nIn an industry built on love stories, Hayley Paige has lived through a plot twist no one saw coming.\nOnce celebrated as the crown jewel of millennial bridal fashion, known for her twirl-worthy silhouettes, sparkle-laced magic, and Instagram-era bridal voice, Hayley\u2019s journey took a devastating detour. A deeply public legal battle over the rights to her own name removed her from the very brand she built, leaving an entire generation of brides (and dreamers) wondering what would come next.\nBut Hayley Paige didn\u2019t disappear. She recalibrated. She healed. She fought.\nAnd now, after years of silence, strength, and strategic rebuilding, she\u2019s back with full creative freedom, ownership, and her signature shine.\nOn July 27, Hayley Paige officially reclaimed the spotlight with the launch of her brand-new 30-piece bridal collection, ushering in a bold new era of design, independence, and storytelling.

A masterclass in resilience.\nWhile her name was in litigation limbo, Hayley quietly turned heartbreak into horsepower. Through her sculptural bridal shoe brand She is Cheval, she continued pushing the boundaries of bridal fashion.

It simply evolved.\nNow with Twice Upon a Time she returns to the aisle. But this time she\u2019s calling every shot.

But beyond the gowns, there\u2019s something even more powerful here: freedom. Ownership. A woman in full.\nIn a world where so many designers lose their names to contracts and corporations, Hayley Paige\u2019s comeback is a reminder that reclaiming your voice is always worth the fight.

      "text": "Uncorking the Math: How to Calculate Your Wedding Alcohol Needs\n- Share via\nI got married last December and one of the hardest planning decisions we had to make was how much alcohol we should order for the reception. What if we overordered? Worse still what if we ran out in the middle of the event? Yikes!\nEstimating the amount of alcohol for your wedding celebrations is tricky. To help you figure out the fine balance between having enough to keep the fun flowing and avoiding excessive waste, we consulted 10 wedding experts and mixologists.\nHow Event Type and Time of Day Affect Wedding Alcohol Quantities\nThe setting and vibe of your celebrations significantly influence guests\u2019 drink choices and consumption.\nYour alcohol needs will depend on the time of day, according to Devanshi Patel, a wedding planner and founder of Shreem Events. According to her, \u201cLighter options such as wines and beers work beautifully for daytime celebrations, while hard liquor is typically reserved for the evening.\u201d\nAlcohol needs for a sit-down reception vs. a dance party also greatly differ. At a formal dinner you\u2019ll need more wine and champagne, whereas for a dance party you should stock up on more hard liquor. The consumption preferences for a summer wedding will be different from those of a winter one.\n\u201cA hosted bar with craft cocktails will require very different planning than a wine-focused reception,\u201d remarks Kirsten Trelenberg, director of events at Juniper and Ivy. \u201cAlso, when calculating alcohol for weddings, the time of year will affect guests\u2019 preferences and drink choices. Overestimate for summer, people drink more when it\u2019s hot!\u201d\nCustomizing Your Wedding Bar Menu: Guest Drink Preferences and Signature Cocktails\nKnowing and communicating your guests\u2019 drink preferences to your vendor will ensure that your wedding bar is well stocked with their favorites.\nFor instance, if your family and friends prefer wine, you\u2019ll want to make certain that\u2019s the bulk of your alcohol order, notes Sara Bauleke, wedding planner and owner of Bella Notte. \u201cGeneral guidelines for alcohol needs are a great place to start, but customizing to the preferences of your guests ensures you won\u2019t run out of a favorite beverage.\u201d\nHow to Create a Simple and Effective Wedding Bar Menu\nAt parties and events leading up to your wedding, keep an eye out for what your friends and family prefer drinking and incorporate those cocktails or spirits in your bar menu. When I was planning my wedding, I noticed that my circle of friends enjoyed tequila cocktails so I made sure those were on the menu.\nVijay Goel, wedding expert and co-owner of 440 Elm by Bite Catering Couture, reiterates this point. \u201cWe recommend signature cocktails over spreadsheets and generic formulas. Most drink calculators are built for bars, not weddings. They won\u2019t know your family has a genetic red wine intolerance or goes hard on Hennessy!\u201d\nHow to Create a Simple and Effective Wedding Bar Menu\nDon\u2019t feel pressured to offer an endless range of alcohol options. A smaller but well-curated bar menu will be less stressful. This way you\u2019ll be able to manage costs and you won\u2019t run out of your guests\u2019 favorites.\nKeep the bar menu simple, balanced, and guest-focused, declares Nick Hirsch, mixologist manager for RMD Group. \u201cOffer a curated selection. Think one signature cocktail, a red and white wine, a light beer, and a couple of versatile and broadly accepted spirits like vodka, tequila, and whiskey,\u201d he adds.\nCounting Heads: Guest Demographics and Drinking Habits\nWhen accurately calculating how much alcohol to order for your wedding, you should factor in the demographics of your guests.\nKeep in mind your guests\u2019 average age, culture, and drinking habits and the time and duration of your event, remarks Ankit Oza, luxury wedding and event planner and founder of Aria Events.\n\u201cStart with a baseline of calculating 1-1.5 drinks per guest, per hour for a five-hour reception. A split of 30% wine, 35% spirits, and 35% beer. Then adjust based on your guests. If you come from a culture where drinking is a big part of the wedding festivities, make sure to order a little more than the baseline,\u201d he adds.\nEstimating the right amount of alcohol for a wedding involves balancing guest count, drink preferences and event duration.\nPamela Wolter, director of sales at The Resort at Pelican Hill, adds,\u201cEstimating two glasses of wine per person for dinner service and one glass of champagne for the toast is the general rule of thumb. A general standard is a wedding reception for six hours. So typically we start our estimates at six drinks per person, two glasses of wine per person and one glass of champagne.\u201d\nWedding Bar Costs: Open Bar Packages vs. Consumption-Based Pricing\nDeciding how you\u2019ll pay for the alcohol, either a fixed package or based on actual consumption, is an important financial decision. Think about how much alcohol your guests typically consume and the kind of vibe you desire while deciding on your alcohol needs.\n\u201cI always recommend choosing a bar package if you\u2019re expecting a lively crowd that\u2019s ready to party,\u201d mentions Olivia Wiley, catering manager at the Kimpton Canary Hotel. \u201cThat way, you don\u2019t have to worry about how much your guests are drinking or get hit with a surprise tab at the end of the night.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to check with your wedding venue if they offer a combination of both packages. Some venues allow couples to choose an unlimited package bar to start, followed by a consumption bar.\n\u201cSee if your venue allows you to start with a package bar (a set hourly rate per person per hour), then switch to a consumption bar,\u201d states Jenna Nickl-Jones, senior catering manager at Omni La Costa Resort & Spa. \u201cMost weddings taper off towards the end of the night, so starting with a package bar covers the heaviest drinking time. Then you can switch to just hosting on consumption when things have died down.\u201d"

      "text": "These Southern California DJs Are Redefining the Celebration Experience\n- Share via\nMusic is never just background noise\u2014it\u2019s the heartbeat of any celebration. A great DJ does more than spin tracks; they read the room, set the mood, and craft an immersive journey that lingers long after the last dance. From the smooth vibes of cocktail hour to the all-out energy of the after-party, DJs are the unsung architects of unforgettable moments. They bridge generations, elevate emotional highs, and bring a presence that turns any gathering into a true celebration.\nDJs are more than entertainers\u2014they\u2019re storytellers behind the booth. With every drop, transition, and blend, they curate a sonic experience that matches the soul of the occasion. Whether it\u2019s hyping up a crowd or tenderly scoring a first dance, the best DJs know how to elevate a moment into a memory. In a world dominated by playlists and algorithms, it\u2019s their instinct, artistry, and human connection that set the vibe apart\u2014and keep the dance floor alive. DJ services in Southern California can include various types of entertainment such as karaoke, event photography, and ambient lighting, adding even more layers to the experience.\nIn an era where automation and playlists reign supreme, the role of the DJ has never been more vital\u2014or more human. These artists don\u2019t just play music; they orchestrate moments that move people. As we celebrate the creatives who bring events to life, let\u2019s not forget the ones behind the turntables, blending culture, connection, and pure joy. The dance floor may be where the night ends, but for the best DJs in the business, that\u2019s where the magic truly begins.\nMore Than a Playlist: Getting the Party Started with Good Vibes\nLet\u2019s be real: anyone can make a playlist. The real service a professional DJ provides is creating good vibes. It\u2019s an art. A great DJ has an almost psychic ability to read the crowd, building the energy from the ground up. They know how to get the party started and, more importantly, how to keep the party flowing from the first guest\u2019s arrival to the very last song of the night.\nThe Art of the Dance Floor\nThe dance floor is the ultimate report card for a DJ. A packed floor is a sign of a successful event. But it\u2019s not just about playing loud, fast music all night. A truly skilled DJ knows how to build waves of energy. They\u2019ll slow things down for a romantic moment, then bring the beats right back up to get everyone moving again. This is what keeps a diverse group of guests, from your grandma to your college friends, engaged and having fun.\nCreating Unforgettable Moments\nWhat people remember years later aren\u2019t the specific songs that were played, but the unforgettable moments that happened. A great DJ is a master at creating these. It might be a perfect, seamless transition into a couple\u2019s special song, a custom remix that gets the entire wedding party on the dance floor, or a nostalgic track that brings everyone together. These are the moments that show up in the photos and videos, the ones that define the celebration.\nFrom Hip Hop to Salsa: The Importance of Musical Versatility\nA great event DJ needs to be a master of many genres. They have to be comfortable and knowledgeable enough to jump from classic rock to modern hip hop, from 80s pop to salsa, sometimes all in the same set. This versatility is what separates professional DJs from someone just hitting play on a pre-made list. They can cater to a diverse crowd and make sure everyone hears something they love. Some DJ services even offer personalized consultation and event planning to customize the experience based on client preferences, ensuring every detail aligns with the vision of the event.\nNot Just for Weddings: DJs for Corporate Events and More\nThe incredible talent of these Southern Cali DJs extends well beyond weddings. They are regularly hired for high-stakes corporate events, brand launches, and private parties like a milestone birthday.

The skills are the same: reading a room, managing the energy, and providing a polished, professional service. Many of them also offer add-ons like lighting packages or a photo booth to complete the entertainment for your next event.\nAdam Gomez: The Crowd-Reading Maestro Behind ADM Entertainment\nMusic isn\u2019t just what Adam Gomez does \u2014 it\u2019s how he vibes and connects with people. As the founder of ADM Entertainment, Adam is a DJ, emcee, and musician who lives for the moment the crowd lights up when the perfect song hits at just the right time. Every set he creates is infused with positive energy and a genuine love for the experience. Several companies allow clients to fill out an event inquiry form to specify details about their event needs, making it easier to tailor the music and vibe to the occasion.\nWhether he\u2019s spinning at a wedding at the Grand Californian Hotel at Disney, setting the tone with chill tunes at a celebrity luxury lounge in the Beverly Hills Wilshire before the Oscars, fueling the vibe for NFL players at the Los Angeles Chargers Headquarters, or mixing the perfect tracks at a George Lopez Charity Golf Tournament, Adam brings the same passion every time. His goal is always to create an experience people can feel, connect with, and remember long after the last song plays. Tempoe Entertainment DJs, the highest reviewed DJ on Yelp in Southern California with over 1,000 perfect 5-star reviews, exemplifies this level of excellence.\nWhat distinguishes Adam\u2019s DJ style in a competitive industry is his deep commitment to personalization.

For weddings in particular, he invests time in getting to know each couple, weaving in musical elements that reflect their story\u2014be it a college fight song or a subtle Disney nod. The result is a soundtrack that feels authentic, thoughtfully curated, and unforgettable.

Step out onto your private lanai - a feature of every room - to bring the outside into your private mini-world of luxury.\nLandscaped gardens lead to pristine, black-sand beaches. Or you can lounge by the infinity pool with endless panoramic views of the Pacific. And if you\u2019re feeling a little lazy, a quick complimentary golf cart ride can get you wherever you need to go. With a singular focus on guest satisfaction, Hana Maui is the perfect spot for a rejuvenating Hawaiian escape.\nAuthentic Hawaiian Culture and Cuisine\nThe resort offers a chance to immerse yourself in the local culture. You won\u2019t find a flashy dinner luau here, but you will find enriching activities that connect you to the heart of Hana. Try your hand at a hula basics class, learn to weave a ti-leaf lei, or get creative with a coconut painting session. This focus on hands-on authentic experiences is what sets Hana Maui apart.\nThe on-site restaurant brings Maui\u2019s rich heritage straight to your table. The menu is a celebration of fresh, local ingredients, with farm-to-table produce and ocean-to-fork seafood taking center stage. Many dishes are inspired by traditional Hawaiian recipes, like Mochiko pancakes and a local breakfast favorite, saimin. Evenings here are all about taking it easy, with an unhurried atmosphere that\u2019s perfect for a romantic dinner or special occasion, often accompanied by the gentle strumming of live Hawaiian music.\nPlanning a Destination Wedding at Hana Maui\nLooking for the perfect place to say \u201cI do?\u201d Hana Maui Resort is a magical spot for a destination wedding in Hawaii. The resort specializes in creating breathtaking events. Think intimate elopements to grand celebrations. You can exchange vows on a dramatic ocean bluff with the Pacific as your witness, or host a romantic reception on the private Guest House Lawn under a canopy of stars. The on-site planning team is there to handle all the details, from coordinating your marriage license to booking local vendors.\nHawaiian traditions offer a deep well of wisdom for starting a new life together, and Hana Maui offers couples getting married an opportunity to embrace them. In the lei exchange couples present each other with a lei, with every blossom representing a special memory or milestone. These flowers, woven together, form a powerful symbol of their unified journey and everlasting love. The maile ti leaf lei takes this a step further, with its intertwined leaves beautifully mirroring two lives intentionally woven into one by devotion and respect.\nTo mark their new beginning, couples can also participate in Ka P\u014dhaku Ho\u2018oku\u2018u\u2014the \u201crelease of the stones.\u201d This ancient ritual, shared by Hawaiian elders, encourages the couple to let go of their past burdens by casting stones into the sea. The act is more than a one-time event; it\u2019s a powerful practice they can return to throughout their lives to reaffirm their commitment.\nWellness and Spa: A Maui Healing Retreat\nDrawing from the island\u2019s own healing traditions, the resort\u2019s spa is not to be missed. You\u2019ll find treatments like lomi lomi massage, heated lava stone therapy and facials that use botanicals grown right here on the island. The atmosphere is calm and restorative, with open-air spaces that welcome in the gentle ocean sounds and warm tropical breezes.\nThe wellness offerings are designed to be personal, encouraging you to slow down and reset. After a morning treatment, the afternoon is yours to spend however you please. A nap in a hammock. A stroll down to the beach. A peaceful moment in the gardens. The focus on balance and renewal is exactly what makes Hana Maui so special.\nYour Unforgettable Journey to Hana\nThe journey to Hana Maui Resort is an adventure in itself, a winding, unforgettable trip down the famous Road to Hana. It\u2019s a route that prepares you for what\u2019s to come. Not just a resort, but an escape. So whether you\u2019re seeking a secluded and romantic destination wedding or a quite place to decompress as a newly-married couple, Hana Maui awaits."

      "text": "Beyond the Centerpiece: Expert Tips for Awe-Inspiring Wedding Reception Tables\n- Share via\nEvery couple dreams of giving their guests a \u201cwow\u201d moment, the moment they enter the wedding venue and gasp in awe at seeing the reception tables set up for the first time.\nWhether you\u2019re going for classic elegance, rustic charm or contemporary minimalism, conceptualizing striking wedding reception tables requires thoughtful consideration and a keen eye for detail. From the linens to the lighting, every detail contributes to the overall look and feel.\nTo help you craft the wedding reception tables of your dreams, we reached out to nine wedding planners and experts. Bookmark this guide to transform your wedding reception into a visually spectacular masterpiece.\nHow to Create Stunning Wedding Tables with Layers, Texture, and Height\nAccording to wedding experts, using a mix of fabrics and decor pieces of different lengths and interesting forms is essential for creating a one-of-a-kind setting.\nTo prevent the table\u2019s decor from looking flat, layer various textures heights and shapes says Margaux Fraise owner and creative director of Harmony Creative Studio. \u201cWe always look to mix textures like velvet linens and raw cotton napkins, ensure varying heights of candles flowers and other table decor and draw the eye around the table with interesting and overlapping shapes in paper goods napkin folds and tableware itself,\u201d she adds.\nLayering decor pieces of differing heights draws the eye upward and outward, giving guests something beautiful to look at at every level and making the space feel rich and full, mentions Lisa Radlovacki creative director of Lisa London Weddings & Events. \u201cMixing tall floral arrangements with low candles and varied linens creates an enchanting dimensional atmosphere especially in a stark ballroom,\u201d she adds.\nLighting Tips for an Intimate and Dramatic Wedding Reception\nSimply incorporating different types of lighting is an easy way to craft an intimate yet dramatic ambiance. Check regarding the lighting options with your venue beforehand to avoid any disappointments later. Sanjana Shah event designer and co-founder of Three Entertainment mentions: \u201cIt\u2019s often overlooked, but the right mix of candlelight fairy lights and focused pin-spot lighting can completely transform the tablescape enhancing textures, floral details and even glassware.\u201d\nChoosing an Eye-Catching and Customized Wedding Centerpiece\nBegin your decor process by conceptualizing a centerpiece or area within your reception space that will set the tone for the overall visual aesthetic.\nMake the sweetheart table (or another key area) the focal point of the decor says Kimberly Sisti, lead planner and floral designer at SISTI & CO. \u201cIt provides stunning photo opportunities and helps define the aesthetic of your entire event. Your floral designer can introduce unique textures, unexpected color combinations and imaginative installations that you might never have considered on your own,\u201d she adds.\nElevate Your Tables with Artful and Personalized Menu Cards\nA customized menu or thank you card acts as an important element, beautifully tying together the ambiance and setting a celebratory tone.\nThe menu or thank you card is often the first thing your guests see when they sit down at the reception table says Nirjary Desai event producer and founder of Kis(Cubed) Events. \u201cHaving a personalized well-designed card that aligns with your theme or aesthetic helps set the mood. From dreamy Parisian menus to hand-calligraphed ones, menu cards can bring the aesthetic of the decor together for your guests,\u201d she adds.\nUpgrading Your Linens for a \u201cWow\u201d Factor on Your Wedding Tables\nExperts state that choosing high-quality textured or patterned linens is a simple yet effective way to instantly elevate your entire table setting.\n\u201cMost venues offer basic options in limited colors, which can feel a little flat,\u201d says Emily Reno, wedding planner and owner of The Vegas Planners. \u201cIf budget allows, choosing a linen with texture or a stylish pattern instantly elevates the entire table, adds a wow factor and keeps things visually interesting for the guests.\u201d\nCreative Centerpiece Ideas: Beyond Flowers to Fresh Produce and Wine Bottles\nA fun new trend in wedding table design involves adding fresh produce directly into your centerpieces. Couples are now embracing an almost farm-to-table decor aesthetic, featuring clusters of pomegranates, figs, oranges or even artichokes artfully nestled amidst flowers says Kinjal Adodra decor expert and founder of DesignHQ.\n\u201cThese elements add unexpected texture color depth and a certain earthiness that feels both lush and contemporary,\u201d she adds. Wine bottle centerpieces are another approach to craft a bespoke and unexpected aesthetic that goes beyond traditional floral arrangements.\nWine bottles as table decor can also function as unique signs and guest books says Jenna Nickl-Jones, senior catering manager at Omni La Costa Resort & Spa. \u201cPlace a custom label on the wine bottle that serves as the table number for guests to find their seats. Guests can also write on the bottle, and then you open that # bottle on your corresponding anniversary. For instance, the Table 1 bottle is opened on your first anniversary, Table 2 on their second etc.\u201d\nMaking Bold Design Choices for a Memorable Wedding Reception\nWedding professionals suggest that the key to leaving a lasting impression is to create a setting that showcases bold and dramatic elements that work well together.\nOne guest could be captivated by striking hues and multi-layered patterns and textures, while another could be awed by the understated luxury of velvet table linens, graceful florals and perfectly symmetrical white taper candles remarks Sarona Farrell, lead planner and founder of Gloweddings. \u201cThe trick is to keep the eye moving from one detail to the next, each element playing off the other in color texture light and sound. Whether your design inspires electric energy or calm restfulness, the emotion it stirs up is what your guests will remember!\u201d she adds.\nDon\u2019t Forget the Guest Experience When Designing Your Tables\nWhile planning your wedding reception table settings, in addition to visual aesthetics, it\u2019s important to keep in mind functionality and guests\u2019 comfort as well. You don\u2019t want the table decor to get in the way of conversation or make it difficult for guests to eat.\nEnsure that there\u2019s enough room for guests to sit comfortably without feeling crowded. Lastly, consider how the different tables will look together in the room and how guests will move around them."

      "text": "The Resort at Pelican Hill: A Dream Italian Wedding in the Heart of Southern California\n- Share via\nA mecca for fabulous, high-profile extravaganzas, the Resort at Pelican Hill is an Italian Renaissance-inspired property with a focus on luxury. Located on the picturesque rolling hills of the Newport Coast, this 504-acre resort will check every box on your wish list if you\u2019ve always wanted a destination Italian wedding.\nItalian Renaissance-Inspired Design With Pacific Ocean Views\nThe sprawling property is home to awe-inspiring architecture inspired by the works of Andrea Palladio, a 16th century Italian architect, as well as groves of 100-year-old olive trees, a 23,000-square-foot spa, one of the largest circular swimming pools in the world and two 36-hole golf courses. At the resort guests are greeted by herringbone brick street pavers that replicate charming Italian plazas, grand porticoes, graceful archways, stately columns, expansive outdoor verandas, hand-applied plaster exteriors and vaulted ceilings.\nBungalows and Villas for Wedding Guests\nThe 332 guest accommodations at Pelican Hill celebrate coastal living. Instead of conventional guest rooms, spacious, single-story bungalows and villas line residential-style streets, creating the inviting ambiance of a Tuscan village on the California coast. For wedding parties and traveling family, the property\u2019s one-of-a-kind residences offer the ideal setting to stay together in comfort and style.\nGuests can choose to stay in a bungalow or a two, three or four-bedroom villa. Each bungalow is well-appointed, boasting wood-beam ceilings, private terraces, elegant furnishings and deep soaking marble tubs, all conceptualized to frame unobstructed vistas of the Pacific Ocean or the manicured golf courses. The villas are great for long stays. They come with personal butlers and are equipped with gourmet kitchens.\nThe Iconic Rotunda and Event Lawn\nThe property is also home to several versatile event spaces. Couples are spoiled for choice with spectacular indoor and outdoor event spaces at Pelican Hill. The highlight is the Event Lawn & Rotunda, a well-manicured oval lawn that extends toward the horizon, where a dramatic Italian rotunda is perched 300 feet above the ocean.\nWith its spectacular domed ceiling and classical columns, the Rotunda offers an awe-inspiring stage for a wedding ceremony with a magnificent backdrop of the Pacific Ocean. The adjacent Mar Vista Ballroom, with its hand-hewn wood beam ceilings and exquisite interiors, serves as the perfect venue for a glamorous reception to follow.\nOne Wedding Per Weekend: A Truly Exclusive Experience\nThe Resort at Pelican Hill\u2019s commitment to an unparalleled experience is perhaps best exhibited by its \u201cOne Wedding per Weekend\u201d policy. By dedicating the entire weekend to a single wedding, the property eliminates the logistical stress and hurried ambiance that can often detract from a couple\u2019s big day.\n\u201cMany of our couples love being the center of attention on their special day, and we make that possible by hosting only one wedding per day or weekend,\u201d says Pamela Wolter, Director of Sales at The Resort at Pelican Hill. \u201cThis exclusive approach allows our team to focus entirely on the couple, ensuring they receive the personalized attention and exceptional service they deserve throughout their celebration.\u201d\nPersonalized Wedding Planning and Concierge Services\nThe Resort at Pelican Hill\u2019s events team usually works with a couple for approximately a year before their wedding. The process begins with an in-person visit to the resort where the property\u2019s expert team escorts the couple across the grounds and shows them every option available for wedding-related receptions, events and celebrations.\n\u201cOnce we understand the scope of the couple\u2019s vision, we present a comprehensive contract and finalize all details within about a month of their visit,\u201d adds Wolter. \u201cOur couples are typically well-traveled and seeking a very high level of privacy. They want their experience to stand out in a way that is unique and expressive of their love story.\u201d\nOnce the contract has been signed Pelican Hill\u2019s culinary team arranges a tasting with the couple. The in-house team of chefs and local culinary experts caters to the bride and groom\u2019s every need. Following that, the property designs a detailed run of events along with the couple\u2019s wedding planner. Then it\u2019s time for the grand event of getting guests checked in and the festivities begin.\nOn the wedding day the hotel provides a wedding concierge who acts as the couple\u2019s assistant. While the wedding planner manages the event\u2019s logistical details, the concierge focuses on the personal requirements of the bride and groom, ensuring they feel relaxed and cared for.\nThe property also offers exclusive locations for the couple to enjoy private moments. \u201cThe manicured garden on a private rooftop is an exclusive location for bride and groom photos and private, post-ceremony champagne and hors d\u2019oeuvres just for couples,\u201d remarks Pamela Wolter.\nThe thoughtful service continues with the banquet professionals. \u201cOur banquet staff and event captains are truly exceptional. They are masters of their craft as they consistently deliver flawless service while expertly following event timelines,\u201d she adds.\nGuest Relaxation and Recreation at Pellican Hill\nThe Resort at Pelican Hill features a range of luxurious amenities designed for pre- and post-wedding unwinding. Evocative of Rome\u2019s well-loved landmark, the Coliseum Pool is a strikingly distinctive swimming pool. Perfectly circular and 136 feet in diameter, it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s largest circular pools, dazzling with 1.1 million hand-cut glass mosaic tiles.\nThe Pelican Hill Golf Club is home to two 36-hole courses. Ocean North and Ocean South are artfully woven through scenic natural terrain and breathtaking ocean vistas. The Spa at Pelican Hill is a 23,000-square-foot oasis dedicated to wellness and healing. With 22 private treatment rooms for massages and facials, the spa also features an Aqua Colonnades with a Palladian rotunda, a wall of flowing water, steam rooms, saunas and saltwater Roman soaking tubs.\nThe Perfect Blend of Old World and West Coast\nStrategically located about an hour\u2019s drive from Los Angeles International Airport, The Resort at Pelican Hill offers a blend of timeless Italian architecture and thoughtful Californian hospitality. This property is where your Italian dream wedding without the international travel becomes a reality, exhibiting the very best of two worlds."
