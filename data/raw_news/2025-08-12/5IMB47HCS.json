  "content": "A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after positive inflation data fueled hopes for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation rose by a modest 0.2% in July and 2.7% over the last year. This cooler-than-expected data prompted a significant market rally, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all climbing as investors grew more optimistic. The prevailing view is that easing inflation gives the central bank room to lower interest rates. Lower rates typically reduce borrowing costs for businesses and make stocks more attractive relative to bonds, contributing to widespread gains across sectors like healthcare.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\u2022 Generic Pharmaceuticals company Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AMPH) jumped 8.3%.

In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 25 days ago when the stock dropped 7.1% as several negative developments weighed on the sector. Weakness in managed care providers was a significant factor, with companies like Elevance Health and Humana seeing declines due to an analyst downgrade and a lost lawsuit regarding Medicare bonus payments, respectively. Additionally, some pharmaceutical and biotech companies experienced sharp drops following unfavorable news; for instance, Sarepta Therapeutics plunged after a report indicated another patient death tied to its experimental gene therapy, and GSK's blood cancer drug dosage was voted against by the FDA advisory committee. Broader market sentiment, including concerns about rising costs and inadequate pricing for 2025 plans among health insurers, also contributed to the downward pressure on healthcare equities.",

      "text": "Regeneron (REGN)\nRegeneron doesn\u2019t excite us. Its weak sales growth and declining returns on capital show its demand and profits are shrinking.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy Regeneron Is Not Exciting\nFounded by scientists who wanted to build a company where science could thrive, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) develops and commercializes medicines for serious diseases, with key products treating eye conditions, allergic diseases, cancer, and other disorders.\n- Demand will likely fall over the next 12 months as Wall Street expects flat revenue\n- A positive is that its healthy adjusted operating margin shows it\u2019s a well-run company with efficient processes\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Regeneron\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Regeneron\nAt $545.98 per share, Regeneron trades at 15.1x forward P/E. Yes, this valuation multiple is lower than that of other healthcare peers, but we\u2019ll remind you that you often get what you pay for.\nWe\u2019d rather pay up for companies with elite fundamentals than get a bargain on weak ones. Cheap stocks can be value traps, and as their performance deteriorates, they will stay cheap or get even cheaper.\n3. Regeneron (REGN) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nBiotech company Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) reported Q2 CY2025 results topping the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 3.6% year on year to $3.68 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $12.89 per share was 52.9% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nRegeneron (REGN) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $3.68 billion vs analyst estimates of $3.30 billion (3.6% year-on-year growth, 11.3% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $12.89 vs analyst estimates of $8.43 (52.9% beat)\n- Operating Margin: 29.4%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 25.2%, up from 4.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $57.64 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded by scientists who wanted to build a company where science could thrive, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) develops and commercializes medicines for serious diseases, with key products treating eye conditions, allergic diseases, cancer, and other disorders.\nRegeneron's business model centers on using proprietary technologies to discover and develop innovative treatments. Its flagship VelociSuite platform includes technologies for producing fully human antibodies and accelerating drug discovery. The company's Regeneron Genetics Center has sequenced nearly 3 million samples to identify genetic targets for potential therapies.\nThe company's product portfolio includes EYLEA and EYLEA HD for retinal diseases; Dupixent for allergic and inflammatory conditions; Libtayo for various cancers; and several other medicines for conditions ranging from high cholesterol to rare diseases. These treatments are used by patients with conditions like macular degeneration, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and certain cancers who need targeted biological therapies to manage their diseases.\nFor example, a patient with severe asthma might receive Dupixent injections every two weeks to reduce inflammation in their airways and prevent asthma attacks, while someone with wet age-related macular degeneration might receive regular EYLEA injections to preserve their vision.\nRegeneron generates revenue through direct sales of its products in the United States and through collaborations internationally. The company has significant partnerships with Sanofi for Dupixent and Kevzara, and with Bayer for EYLEA outside the U.S. These collaborations typically involve shared development costs and profit-splitting arrangements.\nBeyond commercialized products, Regeneron maintains a robust pipeline of candidates in various stages of development. The company is exploring treatments across multiple therapeutic areas, including hematology, immunology, oncology, infectious diseases, and rare genetic disorders. Regeneron also collaborates with companies like Alnylam and Intellia to develop RNA interference and CRISPR gene-editing therapies.\n4. Immuno-Oncology\nOver the next few years, immuno-oncology companies, which harness the immune system to fight illnesses such as cancer, faces strong tailwinds from advancements in precision medicine (including the use of AI to improve hit rates) and growing demand for treatments targeting rare diseases. However, headwinds such as rising scrutiny over drug pricing, regulatory unknowns, and competition from larger, more resourced pharmaceutical companies could weigh on growth.\nRegeneron's competitors vary by therapeutic area. In ophthalmology, EYLEA competes with products from Roche/Genentech, Novartis, and biosimilars from companies like Samsung Bioepis. For Dupixent, competitors include AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca/Amgen. In oncology, Libtayo faces competition from Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, and AstraZeneca.\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $14.21 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Regeneron has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Thankfully, Regeneron\u2019s 14% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was solid. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Regeneron\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 5.9% over the last two years was below its five-year trend.\nWe can better understand the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segments, Collaboration and Product & Pipeline, which are 50.6% and 44.4% of revenue. Over the last two years, Regeneron\u2019s Collaboration revenue averaged 13.3% year-on-year growth while its Product & Pipeline revenue was flat.\nThis quarter, Regeneron reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 3.6% but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 11.3%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 3.3% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds.\n7. Operating Margin\nRegeneron has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a healthcare business, boasting an average operating margin of 38.2%.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Regeneron\u2019s operating margin decreased by 26.9 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 7.2 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\nIn Q2, Regeneron generated an operating margin profit margin of 29.4%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nRegeneron\u2019s EPS grew at a remarkable 10.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. However, this performance was lower than its 14% annualized revenue growth, telling us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded due to non-fundamental factors such as interest expenses and taxes.\nWe can take a deeper look into Regeneron\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Regeneron\u2019s operating margin was flat this quarter but declined by 26.9 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2, Regeneron reported adjusted EPS at $12.89, up from $11.56 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Regeneron\u2019s full-year EPS of $45.64 to shrink by 20.5%.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nRegeneron has shown terrific cash profitability, enabling it to reinvest, return capital to investors, and stay ahead of the competition while maintaining an ample cushion. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the healthcare sector, averaging an eye-popping 31.2% over the last five years.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Regeneron\u2019s margin expanded by 13.4 percentage points during that time. This is encouraging, and we can see it became a less capital-intensive business because its free cash flow profitability rose while its operating profitability fell.\nRegeneron\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $925.4 million in Q2, equivalent to a 25.2% margin. This result was good as its margin was 20.3 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, building on its favorable historical trend.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlthough Regeneron hasn\u2019t been the highest-quality company lately, it found a few growth initiatives in the past that worked out wonderfully. Its five-year average ROIC was 29.6%, splendid for a healthcare business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Regeneron\u2019s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nOne of the best ways to mitigate bankruptcy risk is to hold more cash than debt.\nRegeneron is a profitable, well-capitalized company with $7.47 billion of cash and $2.71 billion of debt on its balance sheet. This $4.76 billion net cash position is 8.2% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from Regeneron\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Regeneron blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates by a wide margin. Zooming out, we think this was a good print with some key areas of upside. The stock remained flat at $550 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Regeneron?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:07 AM EDT\nWe think that the latest earnings result is only one piece of the bigger puzzle. If you\u2019re deciding whether to own Regeneron, you should also grasp the company\u2019s longer-term business quality and valuation.\nThere are some bright spots in Regeneron\u2019s fundamentals, but its business quality ultimately falls short. First off, its revenue growth was solid over the last five years. And while Regeneron\u2019s diminishing returns show management's prior bets haven't worked out, its powerful free cash flow generation enables it to stay ahead of the competition through consistent reinvestment of profits.\nRegeneron\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 15.1x. Investors with a higher risk tolerance might like the company, but we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're pretty confident there are more exciting stocks to buy at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $708.91 on the company (compared to the current share price of $545.98)."

      "text": "QuidelOrtho (QDEL)\nWe wouldn\u2019t recommend QuidelOrtho. Its weak sales growth and low returns on capital show it struggled to generate demand and profits.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think QuidelOrtho Will Underperform\nBorn from the 2022 merger of Quidel and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, QuidelOrtho (NASDAQ:QDEL) develops and manufactures diagnostic testing solutions for healthcare providers, from rapid point-of-care tests to complex laboratory instruments and systems.\n- Incremental sales over the last five years were much less profitable as its earnings per share fell by 13.3% annually while its revenue grew\n- Annual sales declines of 6.9% for the past two years show its products and services struggled to connect with the market during this cycle\n- Underwhelming 1.5% return on capital reflects management\u2019s difficulties in finding profitable growth opportunities, and its decreasing returns suggest its historical profit centers are aging\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than QuidelOrtho\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than QuidelOrtho\nAt $23.64 per share, QuidelOrtho trades at 8.4x forward P/E. This certainly seems like a cheap stock, but we think there are valid reasons why it trades this way.\nCheap stocks can look like a great deal at first glance, but they can be value traps. They often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. QuidelOrtho (QDEL) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nHealthcare diagnostics company QuidelOrtho (NASDAQ:QDEL) met Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales fell by 3.6% year on year to $613.9 million. On the other hand, the company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $2.71 billion at the midpoint came in 0.5% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.12 per share was significantly above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nQuidelOrtho (QDEL) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $613.9 million vs analyst estimates of $611 million (3.6% year-on-year decline, in line)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.12 vs analyst estimates of $0.01 (significant beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $106.8 million vs analyst estimates of $95.86 million (17.4% margin, 11.4% beat)\n- The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $2.71 billion at the midpoint\n- Management reiterated its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance of $2.32 at the midpoint\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $595 million at the midpoint, in line with analyst expectations\n- Operating Margin: -29.4%, down from -18.4% in the same quarter last year\n- Constant Currency Revenue fell 2.4% year on year, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.63 billion\nCompany Overview\nBorn from the 2022 merger of Quidel and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, QuidelOrtho (NASDAQ:QDEL) develops and manufactures diagnostic testing solutions for healthcare providers, from rapid point-of-care tests to complex laboratory instruments and systems.\nQuidelOrtho operates across the entire diagnostic testing spectrum through four main business units: Labs, Molecular Diagnostics, Point of Care, and Transfusion Medicine. The company's products range from clinical chemistry analyzers that measure chemicals in bodily fluids to immunoassay systems that detect proteins related to disease, and from rapid tests that provide results in minutes to sophisticated molecular diagnostic platforms.\nThe company's customers include hospitals, clinical laboratories, physician offices, urgent care clinics, universities, retail clinics, pharmacies, and blood banks across more than 130 countries. During the COVID-19 pandemic, QuidelOrtho expanded its reach directly to consumers with at-home tests, while also serving school districts and health departments.\nA physician might use QuidelOrtho's Sofia rapid test to diagnose a patient with influenza in minutes, allowing for immediate treatment decisions. Meanwhile, a hospital laboratory might run hundreds of patient samples daily on the company's Vitros systems to measure everything from cholesterol levels to thyroid function.\nQuidelOrtho employs a \"razor/razor blade\" business model for much of its revenue, placing instruments with customers under long-term contracts that require the ongoing purchase of proprietary reagents and consumables. This creates a recurring revenue stream, as the instruments are closed systems that only work with QuidelOrtho's supplies.\nThe company maintains manufacturing facilities in the United States and United Kingdom, with a global network of sales centers, administrative offices, and warehouses. QuidelOrtho complements its product offerings with comprehensive services, including remote monitoring, technical support, and consulting services that help laboratories improve workflow and productivity.\nQuidelOrtho's business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, particularly for its respiratory products, which see higher demand during fall and winter cold and flu seasons. The company must navigate complex regulatory requirements across global markets, including FDA clearances in the US and various international approvals.\n4. Medical Devices & Supplies - Imaging, Diagnostics\nThe medical devices and supplies industry, particularly those specializing in imaging and diagnostics, operates with a comparatively stable yet capital-intensive business model. Companies in this space benefit from consistent demand driven by the essential nature of diagnostic tools in patient care, as well as recurring revenue streams from consumables, service contracts, and equipment maintenance. However, the industry faces challenges such as significant upfront development costs, stringent regulatory requirements, and pricing pressures from hospitals and healthcare systems, which are increasingly focused on cost containment. Looking ahead, the industry should enjoy tailwinds from advancements in technology, including the integration of artificial intelligence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency, as well as rising demand for imaging solutions driven by aging populations. On the other hand, headwinds could arise from a rethinking of healthcare costs potentially resulting in reimbursement cuts and slower capital equipment purchasing. Additionally, cybersecurity concerns surrounding connected medical devices could introduce new risks and complexities for manufacturers.\nQuidelOrtho competes with several major players in the diagnostic testing market, including Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Roche (OTC:RHHBY), Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO), Danaher (NYSE:DHR), and Siemens Healthineers (OTC:SMMNY).\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $2.74 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, QuidelOrtho has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Thankfully, QuidelOrtho\u2019s 13.5% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was solid. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. QuidelOrtho\u2019s recent performance marks a sharp pivot from its five-year trend as its revenue has shown annualized declines of 6.9% over the last two years.\nQuidelOrtho also reports sales performance excluding currency movements, which are outside the company\u2019s control and not indicative of demand. Over the last two years, its constant currency sales averaged 6% year-on-year declines. Because this number aligns with its normal revenue growth, we can see that QuidelOrtho has properly hedged its foreign currency exposure.\nThis quarter, QuidelOrtho reported a rather uninspiring 3.6% year-on-year revenue decline to $613.9 million of revenue, in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.1% over the next 12 months. Although this projection suggests its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nQuidelOrtho was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 5.2% was weak for a healthcare business.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, QuidelOrtho\u2019s operating margin decreased by 45.7 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 15.3 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\nThis quarter, QuidelOrtho generated an operating margin profit margin of negative 29.4%, down 11 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nSadly for QuidelOrtho, its EPS declined by 13.3% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 13.5%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nWe can take a deeper look into QuidelOrtho\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, QuidelOrtho\u2019s operating margin declined by 45.7 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 54.8%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders.\nIn Q2, QuidelOrtho reported adjusted EPS at $0.12, up from negative $0.07 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects QuidelOrtho\u2019s full-year EPS of $2.34 to grow 20%.\n9. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nQuidelOrtho has shown impressive cash profitability, giving it the option to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 11.4% over the last five years, better than the broader healthcare sector. The divergence from its underwhelming operating margin stems from the add-back of non-cash charges like depreciation and stock-based compensation. GAAP operating profit expenses these line items, but free cash flow does not.\nTaking a step back, we can see that QuidelOrtho\u2019s margin dropped by 26.2 percentage points during that time. Continued declines could signal it is in the middle of an investment cycle.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nQuidelOrtho historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 1.4%, lower than the typical cost of capital (how much it costs to raise money) for healthcare companies.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, QuidelOrtho\u2019s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nQuidelOrtho reported $151.7 million of cash and $2.76 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $587.6 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view QuidelOrtho\u2019s 4.4\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $96.6 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from QuidelOrtho\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly QuidelOrtho blew past analysts\u2019 EBITDA and EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its full-year EPS guidance missed. Overall, this quarter was mixed, but the market seems willing to forgive weak guidance and focus instead on the strong reported results. The stock traded up 8.3% to $25.67 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy QuidelOrtho?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 11:49 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in QuidelOrtho.\nQuidelOrtho doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. Although its revenue growth was solid over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its diminishing returns show management's prior bets haven't worked out. And while the company\u2019s impressive operating margins show it has a highly efficient business model, the downside is its declining EPS over the last five years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets.\nQuidelOrtho\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 8.4x. While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is huge given its shaky fundamentals. There are superior stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $43.14 on the company (compared to the current share price of $23.64).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

      "text": "Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH)\nAmphastar Pharmaceuticals doesn\u2019t impress us. It\u2019s recently struggled to grow its revenue, a worrying sign for investors seeking high-quality stocks.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Is Not Exciting\nFounded in 1996 and known for its expertise in complex drug formulations, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AMPH) develops and manufactures technically challenging injectable and inhalation medications, including both generic and proprietary pharmaceutical products.\n- Revenue base of $722.7 million puts it at a disadvantage compared to larger competitors exhibiting economies of scale\n- Demand is forecasted to shrink as its estimated sales for the next 12 months are flat\n- A bright spot is that its performance over the past five years shows its incremental sales were extremely profitable, as its annual earnings per share growth of 53.3% outpaced its revenue gains\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\nAmphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s stock price of $27 implies a valuation ratio of 8.4x forward P/E. This sure is a cheap multiple, but you get what you pay for.\nCheap stocks can look like great bargains at first glance, but you often get what you pay for. These mediocre businesses often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nPharmaceutical company Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQAMPH) fell short of the market\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales falling 4.4% year on year to $174.4 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.85 per share was 14.6% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nAmphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $174.4 million vs analyst estimates of $176.1 million (4.4% year-on-year decline, 1% miss)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.85 vs analyst estimates of $0.74 (14.6% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $63.18 million vs analyst estimates of $53.54 million (36.2% margin, 18% beat)\n- Operating Margin: 24.2%, down from 30.3% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 14.3%, down from 34.6% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.02 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 1996 and known for its expertise in complex drug formulations, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AMPH) develops and manufactures technically challenging injectable and inhalation medications, including both generic and proprietary pharmaceutical products.\nAmphastar specializes in products with high technical barriers to market entry, focusing on medications that require sophisticated manufacturing processes and rigorous quality controls. The company's portfolio includes over 25 products, with notable offerings such as BAQSIMI (a nasal glucagon powder for treating severe hypoglycemia), Primatene MIST (an over-the-counter asthma inhaler), and various injectable medications including epinephrine, glucagon, and naloxone.\nWhat sets Amphastar apart is its vertically integrated structure and diverse technical capabilities. The company not only formulates and packages final drug products but also manufactures many of its own active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), including insulin. This vertical integration gives Amphastar greater control over its supply chain and quality standards while potentially improving margins.\nAmphastar's technical expertise spans several challenging areas of pharmaceutical development. The company has developed capabilities in characterizing complex molecules, analyzing immunogenicity (how drugs trigger immune responses), engineering drug particles for optimal delivery, and creating sustained-release formulations. These specialized skills enable Amphastar to tackle difficult-to-manufacture products that many competitors cannot easily replicate.\nFor healthcare providers, Amphastar's products offer essential treatment options across multiple therapeutic areas. A hospital might stock Amphastar's prefilled epinephrine syringes for emergency anaphylaxis treatment, while an endocrinologist might prescribe BAQSIMI for diabetic patients at risk of severe hypoglycemia. Meanwhile, consumers with mild asthma can purchase Primatene MIST without a prescription at retail pharmacies.\nThe company markets its products primarily to hospitals, long-term care facilities, clinics, and retail pharmacies, working through major group purchasing organizations and specialty distributors. Amphastar is also developing a pipeline of over 20 product candidates, including generic, biosimilar, and proprietary medications, with a particular focus on interchangeable insulin products for diabetes care.\n4. Generic Pharmaceuticals\nThe generic pharmaceutical industry operates on a volume-driven, low-cost business model, producing bioequivalent versions of branded drugs once their patents expire. These companies benefit from consistent demand for affordable medications, as they are critical to reducing healthcare costs. Generics typically face lower R&D expenses and shorter regulatory approval timelines compared to branded drug makers, enabling cost efficiencies. However, the industry is highly competitive, with intense pricing pressures, thin margins, and frequent legal challenges from branded pharmaceutical companies over patent disputes. Looking ahead, the industry is supported by tailwinds such as the role of AI in streamlining drug development (reverse engineering complex formulations) and manufacturing efficiency (optimize processes and remove inefficiencies). Governments and insurers' focus on reducing drug costs can also boost generics' adoption. However, headwinds include escalating pricing pressure from large buyers like pharmacy chains and healthcare distributors as well as evolving regulatory hurdles.\nAmphastar faces competition from pharmaceutical companies specializing in injectable and inhalation markets, including Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA), Viatris (NASDAQ:VTRS), Sandoz (NYSE:SDZ), Fresenius Kabi, and Hikma Pharmaceuticals (OTC:HKMPY). In the diabetes care space, particularly for insulin products, Amphastar competes with Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY).\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $722.7 million in revenue over the past 12 months, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Thankfully, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s 16.7% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was impressive. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 15.6% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand.\nThis quarter, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 4.4% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $174.4 million of revenue.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.1% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection is underwhelming and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds.\n7. Adjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income (the bottom line) excluding the impact of non-recurring expenses, taxes, and interest on debt - metrics less connected to business fundamentals.\nAmphastar Pharmaceuticals has been an efficient company over the last five years. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the healthcare sector, boasting an average adjusted operating margin of 29.3%.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s adjusted operating margin rose by 19 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it immense operating leverage. Zooming in on its more recent performance, we can see the company\u2019s trajectory is intact as its margin has also increased by 3.1 percentage points on a two-year basis.\nThis quarter, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals generated an adjusted operating margin profit margin of 31.4%, down 5.4 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nAmphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s EPS grew at an astounding 53.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 16.7% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nDiving into Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s quality of earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s adjusted operating margin declined this quarter but expanded by 19 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its higher earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals reported adjusted EPS at $0.85, down from $0.94 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s full-year EPS of $3.47 to shrink by 5.9%.\n9. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nAmphastar Pharmaceuticals has shown robust cash profitability, giving it an edge over its competitors and the ability to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 18.1% over the last five years, quite impressive for a healthcare business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s margin expanded by 1.9 percentage points during that time. This is encouraging because it gives the company more optionality.\nAmphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $25.03 million in Q2, equivalent to a 14.3% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 20.2 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, prompting us to pay closer attention. Short-term fluctuations typically aren\u2019t a big deal because investment needs can be seasonal, but we\u2019ll be watching to see if the trend extrapolates into future quarters.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlthough Amphastar Pharmaceuticals hasn\u2019t been the highest-quality company lately, it historically found a few growth initiatives that worked. Its five-year average ROIC was 14.2%, higher than most healthcare businesses.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Fortunately, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s ROIC averaged 4.3 percentage point increases over the last few years. This is a good sign, and if its returns keep rising, there\u2019s a chance it could evolve into an investable business.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nAmphastar Pharmaceuticals reported $234 million of cash and $608.7 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $262.7 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s 1.4\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $21.94 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing Amphastar Pharmaceuticals beat analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue slightly missed. Overall, this was a mixed quarter. The stock traded up 6% to $22.95 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Amphastar Pharmaceuticals?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:23 AM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Amphastar Pharmaceuticals.\nThere are some bright spots in Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s fundamentals, but its business quality ultimately falls short. First off, its revenue growth was impressive over the last five years. And while Amphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s subscale operations give it fewer distribution channels than its larger rivals, its expanding adjusted operating margin shows the business has become more efficient.\nAmphastar Pharmaceuticals\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 8.4x. While this valuation is reasonable, we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $31.20 on the company (compared to the current share price of $27)."

      "text": "Select Medical (SEM)\nSelect Medical faces an uphill battle. Its poor sales growth and falling returns on capital suggest its growth opportunities are shrinking.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Select Medical Will Underperform\nWith a nationwide network spanning 46 states and over 2,700 healthcare facilities, Select Medical (NYSE:SEM) operates critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and occupational health centers across the United States.\n- Incremental sales over the last five years were much less profitable as its earnings per share fell by 3.4% annually while its revenue grew\n- Sales are projected to tank by 4.5% over the next 12 months as its demand continues evaporating\n- Sales tumbled by 2.1% annually over the last two years, showing market trends are working against its favor during this cycle\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Select Medical\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Select Medical\nSelect Medical is trading at $12.07 per share, or 10.3x forward P/E. Yes, this valuation multiple is lower than that of other healthcare peers, but we\u2019ll remind you that you often get what you pay for.\nOur advice is to pay up for elite businesses whose advantages are tailwinds to earnings growth. Don\u2019t get sucked into lower-quality businesses just because they seem like bargains. These mediocre businesses often never achieve a higher multiple as hoped, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. Select Medical (SEM) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nHealthcare services company Select Medical (NYSE:SEM) met Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales fell by 23.9% year on year to $1.34 billion. The company\u2019s outlook for the full year was close to analysts\u2019 estimates with revenue guided to $5.4 billion at the midpoint. Its GAAP profit of $0.32 per share was 13.9% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nSelect Medical (SEM) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $1.34 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.34 billion (23.9% year-on-year decline, in line)\n- EPS (GAAP): $0.32 vs analyst estimates of $0.28 (13.9% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $125.4 million vs analyst estimates of $128.4 million (9.4% margin, 2.3% miss)\n- The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $5.4 billion at the midpoint\n- EPS (GAAP) guidance for the full year is $1.14 at the midpoint, beating analyst estimates by 3.1%\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $520 million at the midpoint, in line with analyst expectations\n- Operating Margin: 6.5%, down from 9% in the same quarter last year\n- Sales Volumes were flat year on year (-0.4% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $1.90 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith a nationwide network spanning 46 states and over 2,700 healthcare facilities, Select Medical (NYSE:SEM) operates critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and occupational health centers across the United States.\nSelect Medical's business is organized into four distinct segments, each addressing different healthcare needs. The Critical Illness Recovery Hospital segment operates facilities certified as long-term care hospitals (LTCHs), serving patients with complex medical conditions requiring extended recovery periods, typically following intensive care. These patients often have serious conditions affecting multiple organ systems, with an average stay of about a month.\nThe Rehabilitation Hospital segment provides comprehensive physical medicine and rehabilitation programs for patients recovering from conditions like brain and spinal cord injuries, strokes, and orthopedic issues. These inpatient facilities are certified as IRFs (Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities) by Medicare.\nThrough its Outpatient Rehabilitation segment, Select Medical delivers physical, occupational, and speech therapy services at clinics typically located in medical complexes or retail settings. These facilities treat patients with musculoskeletal impairments from accidents, sports injuries, or post-surgical conditions, helping them regain functional abilities.\nThe Concentra segment focuses on occupational health, operating centers and onsite clinics at employer workplaces. Services include treating work-related injuries, conducting pre-employment physicals, substance abuse testing, and providing preventative care. This segment is particularly important for industries with higher workplace injury risks, such as transportation, manufacturing, and construction.\nSelect Medical generates revenue primarily through reimbursements from Medicare, commercial insurance, workers' compensation programs, and other healthcare payors. The company has announced plans to separate its Concentra business into a standalone public company by the end of 2024, which would create two distinct publicly traded healthcare entities.\n4. Outpatient & Specialty Care\nThe outpatient and specialty care industry delivers targeted medical services in non-hospital settings that are often cost-effective compared to inpatient alternatives. This means that they are more desired as rising healthcare costs and ways to combat them become more and more top-of-mind. Outpatient and specialty care providers boast revenue streams that are stable due to the recurring nature of treatment for chronic conditions and long-term patient relationships. However, their reliance on government reimbursement programs like Medicare means stroke-of-the-pen risk. Additionally, scaling a network of facilities can be capital-intensive with uneven return profiles amid competition from integrated healthcare systems. Looking ahead, the industry is positioned to grow as demand for outpatient services expands, driven by aging populations, a rising prevalence of chronic diseases, and a shift toward value-based care models. Tailwinds include advancements in medical technology that support more complex procedures in outpatient settings and the increasing focus on preventive care, which can be aided by data and AI. However, headwinds such as reimbursement rate cuts, labor shortages, and the financial strain of digitization may temper growth.\nSelect Medical's competitors include Encompass Health Corporation (NYSE: EHC), which operates in the inpatient rehabilitation and home health segments, ScionHealth, which runs long-term acute care hospitals, and U.S. Physical Therapy (NYSE: USPH) in the outpatient rehabilitation space.\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $5.77 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Select Medical has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Unfortunately, Select Medical\u2019s 1.3% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was tepid. This fell short of our benchmarks and is a tough starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Select Medical\u2019s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 2.1% annually.\nSelect Medical also reports its number of admissions, which reached 8,966 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Select Medical\u2019s admissions averaged 1.4% year-on-year declines. Because this number is in line with its revenue growth, we can see the company kept its prices fairly consistent.\nThis quarter, Select Medical reported a rather uninspiring 23.9% year-on-year revenue decline to $1.34 billion of revenue, in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 3.9% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last two years. This projection is underwhelming and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds.\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nSelect Medical was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 8.7% was weak for a healthcare business.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Select Medical\u2019s operating margin decreased by 7.2 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 1.9 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\nThis quarter, Select Medical generated an operating margin profit margin of 6.5%, down 2.5 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nSadly for Select Medical, its EPS declined by 3.4% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 1.3%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded due to non-fundamental factors such as interest expenses and taxes.\nDiving into the nuances of Select Medical\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Select Medical\u2019s operating margin declined by 7.2 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2, Select Medical reported EPS at $0.32, down from $0.60 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Select Medical\u2019s full-year EPS of $1.06 to grow 5.5%.\n9. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nSelect Medical has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 4.2%, subpar for a healthcare business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Select Medical\u2019s margin dropped by 7.5 percentage points during that time. This along with its unexciting margin put the company in a tough spot, and shareholders are likely hoping it can reverse course. If the trend continues, it could signal it\u2019s in the middle of a big investment cycle.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nSelect Medical\u2019s management team makes decent investment decisions and generates value for shareholders. Its five-year average ROIC was 9.4%, slightly better than typical healthcare business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Select Medical\u2019s ROIC has unfortunately decreased. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nSelect Medical reported $52.35 million of cash and $2.86 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $598.3 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Select Medical\u2019s 4.7\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $143 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from Select Medical\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing Select Medical beat analysts\u2019 full-year EPS guidance expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock remained flat at $14.79 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Select Medical?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:17 AM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy Select Medical or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nSelect Medical doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. To kick things off, its revenue growth was uninspiring over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. On top of that, Select Medical\u2019s declining EPS over the last five years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets, and its admissions declined.\nSelect Medical\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 10.3x. While this valuation is reasonable, we don\u2019t see a big opportunity at the moment. There are superior stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $17.83 on the company (compared to the current share price of $12.07).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

      "text": "Integra LifeSciences (IART)\nWe wouldn\u2019t recommend Integra LifeSciences. Its weak sales growth and low returns on capital show it struggled to generate demand and profits.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Integra LifeSciences Will Underperform\nFounded in 1989 as a pioneer in regenerative medicine technology, Integra LifeSciences (NASDAQ:IART) develops and manufactures medical technologies for neurosurgery, wound care, and surgical reconstruction, including regenerative tissue products and surgical instruments.\n- Performance over the past five years shows its incremental sales were less profitable as its earnings per share were flat\n- Absence of organic revenue growth over the past two years suggests it may have to lean into acquisitions to drive its expansion\n- Smaller revenue base of $1.62 billion means it hasn\u2019t achieved the economies of scale that some industry juggernauts enjoy\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Integra LifeSciences\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Integra LifeSciences\nIntegra LifeSciences is trading at $12.75 per share, or 5.2x forward P/E. This certainly seems like a cheap stock, but we think there are valid reasons why it trades this way.\nCheap stocks can look like a great deal at first glance, but they can be value traps. They often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. Integra LifeSciences (IART) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nMedical device company Integra LifeSciences (NASDAQ:IART) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales were flat year on year at $415.6 million. The company expects next quarter\u2019s revenue to be around $415 million, close to analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.45 per share was 4.4% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nIntegra LifeSciences (IART) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $415.6 million vs analyst estimates of $395 million (flat year on year, 5.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.45 vs analyst estimates of $0.43 (4.4% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $71.22 million vs analyst estimates of $66.75 million (17.1% margin, 6.7% beat)\n- The company dropped its revenue guidance for the full year to $1.67 billion at the midpoint from $1.68 billion, a 0.9% decrease\n- Management reiterated its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance of $2.24 at the midpoint\n- Operating Margin: -123%, down from 11.3% in the same quarter last year largely due to $511 million one-time impairment charge\n- Free Cash Flow was -$11.23 million, down from $10.69 million in the same quarter last year\n- Organic Revenue fell 1.4% year on year (2.3% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $961.3 million\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 1989 as a pioneer in regenerative medicine technology, Integra LifeSciences (NASDAQ:IART) develops and manufactures medical technologies for neurosurgery, wound care, and surgical reconstruction, including regenerative tissue products and surgical instruments.\nIntegra operates through two main business segments: Codman Specialty Surgical (CSS) and Tissue Technologies (TT). The CSS segment provides neurosurgical technologies and instrumentation used in treating brain tumors, traumatic brain injuries, and other neurological conditions. Its product portfolio includes dural repair materials, ultrasonic tissue ablation devices, intracranial pressure monitoring systems, and cranial stabilization equipment. These technologies serve neurosurgeons in operating rooms and neuro-critical care units worldwide.\nThe Tissue Technologies segment focuses on regenerative products for complex wound surgery, surgical reconstruction, and peripheral nerve repair. Integra has developed multiple regenerative technology platforms using materials like bovine collagen, human amniotic tissue, and resorbable synthetic mesh. For example, a burn surgeon might use Integra Dermal Regeneration Template to provide a scaffold for new skin growth in severe burn patients, while a plastic surgeon could use SurgiMend for breast reconstruction following mastectomy.\nThe company manufactures its products in facilities across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Europe, while maintaining a global commercial presence. Integra sells its technologies through direct sales forces, distributors, and strategic partnerships to hospitals, integrated health networks, and surgery centers in more than 130 countries.\nBeyond product sales, Integra invests significantly in research and development to enhance existing technologies and create new solutions. The company's innovation strategy includes both internal development and strategic acquisitions to expand its technological capabilities, such as its acquisition of Rebound Therapeutics, which added minimally invasive surgical technologies to its portfolio.\nIntegra generates revenue through direct product sales to healthcare providers and through private-label arrangements with other medical technology companies that incorporate Integra's regenerative and wound care technologies into their own product lines.\n4. Surgical Equipment & Consumables - Specialty\nThe surgical equipment and consumables industry provides tools, devices, and disposable products essential for surgeries and medical procedures. These companies therefore benefit from relatively consistent demand, driven by the ongoing need for medical interventions, recurring revenue from consumables, and long-term contracts with hospitals and healthcare providers. However, the high costs of R&D and regulatory compliance, coupled with intense competition and pricing pressures from cost-conscious customers, can constrain profitability. Over the next few years, tailwinds include aging populations, which tend to need surgical interventions at higher rates. The increasing integration of AI and robotics into surgical procedures could also create opportunities for differentiation and innovation. However, the industry faces headwinds including potential supply chain vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory requirements, and more widespread efforts to make healthcare less costly.\nIntegra LifeSciences competes with several major medical technology companies, including Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK), and Steris PLC (NYSE:STE) in its neurosurgical and surgical instrument markets. In the regenerative medicine and wound care segments, key competitors include Smith & Nephew (NYSE:SNN), Organogenesis (NASDAQ:ORGO), MiMedx Group (NASDAQ:MDXG), and Axogen (NASDAQ:AXGN).\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $1.62 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Integra LifeSciences is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Regrettably, Integra LifeSciences\u2019s sales grew at a tepid 3.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This was below our standard for the healthcare sector and is a tough starting point for our analysis.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Integra LifeSciences\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 2.4% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was consistently weak.\nWe can dig further into the company\u2019s sales dynamics by analyzing its organic revenue, which strips out one-time events like acquisitions and currency fluctuations that don\u2019t accurately reflect its fundamentals. Over the last two years, Integra LifeSciences\u2019s organic revenue averaged 1.4% year-on-year declines. Because this number is lower than its two-year revenue growth, we can see that some mixture of acquisitions and foreign exchange rates boosted its headline results.\nThis quarter, Integra LifeSciences\u2019s $415.6 million of revenue was flat year on year but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 5.2%. Company management is currently guiding for a 9% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.9% over the next 12 months. Although this projection indicates its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nIntegra LifeSciences was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 8.6% was weak for a healthcare business.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Integra LifeSciences\u2019s operating margin decreased by 42.7 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 42 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\nThis quarter, Integra LifeSciences generated an operating margin profit margin of negative 123%, down 134.6 percentage points year on year largely due to a $511 million one-time impairment charge.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nIntegra LifeSciences\u2019s flat EPS over the last five years was below its 3.2% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded due to non-fundamental factors such as interest expenses and taxes.\nDiving into the nuances of Integra LifeSciences\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Integra LifeSciences\u2019s operating margin declined by 42.7 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2, Integra LifeSciences reported adjusted EPS at $0.45, down from $0.63 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 4.4%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Integra LifeSciences\u2019s full-year EPS of $2.24 to grow 9%.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nIntegra LifeSciences has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 8.6% over the last five years, slightly better than the broader healthcare sector.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Integra LifeSciences\u2019s margin dropped by 21 percentage points during that time. Continued declines could signal it is in the middle of an investment cycle.\nIntegra LifeSciences burned through $11.23 million of cash in Q2, equivalent to a negative 2.7% margin. The company\u2019s cash flow turned negative after being positive in the same quarter last year, suggesting its historical struggles have dragged on.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nIntegra LifeSciences historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 4%, lower than the typical cost of capital (how much it costs to raise money) for healthcare companies. This quarter was impacted largely by by a $511 million one-time impairment charge.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Integra LifeSciences\u2019s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n11. Balance Sheet Risk\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nIntegra LifeSciences burned through $37.43 million of cash over the last year, and its $1.84 billion of debt exceeds the $253.6 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble.\nUnless the Integra LifeSciences\u2019s fundamentals change quickly, it might find itself in a position where it must raise capital from investors to continue operating. Whether that would be favorable is unclear because dilution is a headwind for shareholder returns.\nWe remain cautious of Integra LifeSciences until it generates consistent free cash flow or any of its announced financing plans materialize on its balance sheet.\n12. Key Takeaways from Integra LifeSciences\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Integra LifeSciences blew past analysts\u2019 organic revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS guidance for next quarter missed and its revenue guidance for the full year was lowered, which is never a good sign. Overall, this print was weaker. The stock remained flat at $12.40 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Integra LifeSciences?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:10 AM EDT\nA common mistake we notice when investors are deciding whether to buy a stock or not is that they simply look at the latest earnings results. Business quality and valuation matter more, so we urge you to understand these dynamics as well.\nWe cheer for all companies helping people live better, but in the case of Integra LifeSciences, we\u2019ll be cheering from the sidelines. First off, its revenue growth was uninspiring over the last five years. And while its sturdy operating margins show it has disciplined cost controls, the downside is its cash profitability fell over the last five years. On top of that, its declining adjusted operating margin shows the business has become less efficient.\nIntegra LifeSciences\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 5.2x. While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is huge given its shaky fundamentals. There are better stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $15.88 on the company (compared to the current share price of $12.75).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."
