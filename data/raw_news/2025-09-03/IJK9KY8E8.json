  "title": "We tested Breville\u2019s Luxe Brewer Glass Drip Coffee Maker: Here\u2019s Where It Shines and Stumble",
  "description": "The Breville Luxe Brewer Glass delivers great taste\u2014including cold brew\u2014 and some customization, but it\u2019s less intuitive than you might expect of a drip coffee maker.",
  "content": "Breville\u2019s new drip coffee line, the Luxe Brewer, comes with thermal and glass carafe options. I wanted to test the Luxe Brewer Glass variation to see how it compared to our Moccamaster drip coffee maker (also with a glass carafe), and was eager to test out the cold brew feature.\n\nThe results were impressive but took some laboring to achieve.\n\nThis next-generation Luxe Brewer line seems really promising on paper, and it largely delivers in action, too, though a little awkwardly.\n\u2022 Setup. Coming off the heels of the Bambino Plus\u2019 breezy setup, the Luxe Brewer Glass\u2019 multi-step process threw me for a bit of a loop. The included manual recommends an initial flushing cycle and water hardness testing before starting the first brew. Easy enough on paper, but I spent way too much time trying to decipher the largely uninformative user manual visuals about the water hardness read-out and looking for a missing water filter component, that I ended up with a smooth but lackluster first pot of coffee. And when I pushed the sole button to begin the brew, nothing happened; the display went straight to warming. I needed to rapidly press the button to start the brewing process. None of this is laid out in the included user manual. And speaking of user manuals, the online version, inexplicably, is more detailed and clearer than the included manual, which is too lengthy to be a quick-start guide and yet not detailed enough to be very helpful.\n\u2022 Speed. I expect a drip coffee machine to be pretty fast, and the Luxe Brewer Glass is speedy\u2014though more discerning buyers can change the bloom time and flow rate to slow things down. I saw a 10-cup brew take about 6.5 minutes on average, which is about the same speed I see in the 8-cup Moccamaster. It\u2019s handy that the LCD displays the brew time and warming time too, which can be set for up to six hours after brewing ends.\n\u2022 Ease of use. I can\u2019t give this coffee maker a perfect score for usability. Even after about two weeks of use, I still questioned whether something might go wrong. The settings aren\u2019t as clear as I would like, and the button and toggling inputs are also strangely cryptic and inconsistent. A lot of information seems to be left out of the documentation for this version. The thermal variation has different options that seem much more intuitive.\n\u2022 Results. After some tweaking, I found that this machine consistently delivers a smooth-tasting pot of drip coffee. But my favorite part is the cold brew capability. Again, the online user manual is the place to look for guidance, but there's information missing there, too. I kept seeing what I thought was an error message about removing the carafe lid, which I saw in an early attempt when the lid to the carafe was not aligned properly and needed repositioning. In the case of cold brew, this message turns out to be a reminder to leave the carafe lid off so that the cold brew can dispense when ready. Those quirks aside, the cold brew setting is hands-off and delivers results that rival (and maybe surpass) a cold brew at the neighborhood coffee shop. I was also pleased that the coffee volume recommendation was spot on, and the flavor was rich and plain delicious.\n\u2022 Customization. This coffee maker offers some latitude for the more experienced coffee drinker. You can set the bloom time, water hardness level, include a proprietary water filter, and choose from two different filter basket shapes depending on the type of bean and flavor profile you prefer. These are all nice perks, but you don\u2019t need to use them to enjoy a tasty pot of coffee. Probably my favorite feature, besides the cold brew setting, is the delayed start function, which allows you to choose when you want the first or repeat pot of coffee to brew\u2014and it worked without a hitch.\n\u2022 Design. The Luxe Brewer Glass is attractive, but it has a slightly plasticky feel. Despite the large water capacity, this machine isn\u2019t overbearing in size. I love the ability to remove the water tank. That\u2019s not something our Moccamaster allows. However, for a relatively limited settings menu, I found the experience a little overcomplicated and the button inputs sometimes unresponsive and unpredictable.\n\nThough I still felt like I didn\u2019t know how to use the machine completely after a couple of weeks, I did come to expect a solid pot of coffee. Plus, the cold brew really won me over, as did the idea that I could brew a cup to wake me up, just like a commercial. And while there\u2019s some solid customization and refining available, this machine seems like it's trying to appeal to the general user and the coffee enthusiast, with mixed results. People seeking a drip coffee maker with a 12-cup capacity probably aren\u2019t looking for a lot of refining. And for a supposedly one-touch machine, the price is a bit much for what you get. For cold brew alone, I think the Breville Luxe Brewer Glass is a worthy purchase. If you want a drip coffee machine that\u2019s not too imposing and offers some personalization power, and you don\u2019t mind the price, this machine isn\u2019t a bad option. \n\n What Makes a Coffee Maker \u2018Smart\u2019?

Here\u2019s How to Tell From app controls to voice commands, these are the features that separate smart coffee makers from basic brewers By Jon Fisher Jon Fisher Editor Wichita Technical Institute Jonathan Fisher is a CompTIA-certified technologist with more than 10 years of experience writing for publications like TechNorms and Help Desk Geek. lifewire's editorial guidelines Published on August 6, 2025 A smart coffee maker might pair with an app for brew strength control and other advanced features. Onfokus / iStock Unreleased / Getty Images In This Article View All In This Article What Makes Them Smart Smart vs Basic Is It Worth It? Close Coffee makers come in all shapes and sizes and offer a variety of ways to brew your favorite cup. One of the most modern options is the smart coffee maker. It still makes the same great coffee you're used to, but it's wrapped in tech to make the brewing process easier or more convenient, and oftentimes a little more fun, too. What Is a Smart Coffee Maker? Identifying whether a coffee maker is actually smart can be tough. Some machines include digital displays and scheduling options that make them seem pretty smart at first glance, but these are often just programmable models. So, what actually makes a coffee maker smart? Generally, a smart coffee maker is characterized by its ability to connect to the internet. This allows it to be controlled remotely using a smartphone app, voice assistant, or smart home devices. We'll get into the differences between programmable and smart coffee machines below, but as a rule of thumb: if it connects to your phone or smart home system via the internet, it's smart. If it doesn't, it's probably just programmable. What Are Smart Ovens and Stoves? Smart Coffee Makers vs Basic and Programmable Ones There are several ways to make coffee, but most methods can be filtered into three main categories, ranked by level of technology: basic, programmable, and smart. Basic Coffee Makers A French press coffee maker operates manually and does not require electricity. Tony Anderson / DigitalVision / Getty Images Most people have seen a traditional, basic coffee maker. This method can be manual or automatic, and is often enjoyed by anyone who wants control over the brewing process or is looking for something cheap and easy to use. A French press is one example of a classic coffee maker. You can often identify this kind of machine by these traits: It's fully manual or uses just a few mechanical parts.There are no timers, digital controls, or screens (apart from maybe a clock).You can start using the coffee maker within minutes of unboxing it.Depending on the machine, it can work with or without power. Programmable Coffee Makers A programmable coffee maker might have buttons for scheduling and adjusting brew strength. Coffee-rank.com The programmable coffee maker is extremely common, especially for people who like to have coffee ready at the same time every day. It uses electricity to heat the water, make the coffee, and control other functions. These coffee machines are ideal if you like to prepare your coffee ahead of time. Here are some things a programmable coffee maker can do that most basic coffee makers can not: Schedule when to brew the coffee via buttons on the device.Control the brew strength to match your specific tastes.Grind whole coffee beans as part of the brewing process.Keep the coffee warm after it's been made. Smart Coffee Makers A smart coffee maker can be controlled remotely via an app. Onfokus / iStock / Getty Images Plus You can think of a smart coffee machine as a programmable one with a few extra conveniences. The defining feature of a smart coffee maker is its ability to be controlled with technology that exists outside of itself, like your smartphone or other smart device. For this to work, it needs to have Bluetooth or Wi-Fi access. An internet-enabled coffee maker unlocks several unique features: Use an app to set timers to schedule when the coffee should start brewing. Trigger a new cup of coffee manually from an app or smart speaker. Integrate it with smart home system routines to trigger coffee when your alarm goes off. Learn how much coffee you're consuming over time. Receive mobile alerts when it's time to clean the coffee maker. Set up automatic orders when your coffee runs low. Should I Get a Smart Coffee Maker? Deciding whether to upgrade your coffee maker to one that's more tech-focused depends on things like your budget, lifestyle, and existing setup. If you like the idea of automating your morning routine, a programmable coffee maker will do just fine. On the other hand, setting schedules is usually easier with an app or smart speaker, and you'll need a smart coffee maker if the plan is to tie it into your smart home setup. Just remember that smart coffee makers aren't cheap and might be too much tech for what you're after. If you like the hands-on experience of making coffee or enjoy the 10-minute kitchen routine, a basic or programmable model is probably enough.
