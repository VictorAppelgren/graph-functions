  "content": "In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. We regret to report that long term Laurentian Bank of Canada (TSE:LB) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 25% in three years, versus a market return of about 47%.\n\nNow let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nLaurentian Bank of Canada became profitable within the last five years. We would usually expect to see the share price rise as a result. So given the share price is down it's worth checking some other metrics too.\n\nWe note that the dividend seems healthy enough, so that probably doesn't explain the share price drop. Revenue has been pretty flat over three years, so that isn't an obvious reason shareholders would sell. So it might be worth looking at how revenue growth over time, in greater detail.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nWe know that Laurentian Bank of Canada has improved its bottom line lately, but what does the future have in store? So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Laurentian Bank of Canada will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Laurentian Bank of Canada the TSR over the last 3 years was -9.1%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nLaurentian Bank of Canada's TSR for the year was broadly in line with the market average, at 21%. Most would be happy with a gain, and it helps that the year's return is actually better than the average return over five years, which was 8%. Even if the share price growth slows down from here, there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Laurentian Bank of Canada you should be aware of.",

Share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just business performance, as well as the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS) over time. The company became profitable within the last five years, which is usually expected to lead to a rise in the share price.

      "text": "Results\n22\nMidstream oil and gas companies, specifically pipeline operators, are well-positioned to benefit from Trump\u2019s executive orders on fossil fuels enacted in early 2025. \u2013 \u2013 These policies aim to accelerate infrastructure development by streamlining environmental reviews and permitting processes, such as those under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$321.0b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$158.18\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n7.2%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$69.7b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.07\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n25.5%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$59.3b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.70\n7D\n1.8%\n1Y\n24.6%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$52.2b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$237.56\n7D\n3.2%\n1Y\n29.1%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$52.0b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$170.88\n7D\n5.3%\n1Y\n-2.5%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$47.1b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$74.84\n7D\n2.5%\n1Y\n-15.5%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.3b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$101.66\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n33.4%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.7b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.45\n7D\n1.4%\n1Y\n10.4%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.5b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$17.70\n7D\n0.9%\n1Y\n19.8%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$40.70\n7D\n1.7%\n1Y\n-5.9%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$24.32\n7D\n2.5%\n1Y\n-27.1%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.6b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$31.20\n7D\n4.1%\n1Y\n43.1%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.5b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$24.47\n7D\n6.9%\n1Y\n19.0%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$554.8m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.53\n7D\n4.1%\n1Y\n-21.7%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$397.1m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.29\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n-37.6%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$253.2m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$20.68\n7D\n3.6%\n1Y\n-43.9%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$76.2m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.10\n7D\n2.8%\n1Y\n-0.1%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$38.7m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.82\n7D\n-1.3%\n1Y\n-56.6%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$1.3m\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0025\n7D\n78.6%\n1Y\n-75.0%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"

  "argos_summary": "Laurentian Bank of Canada\u2019s share price has fallen 25% over three years, lagging the market\u2019s 47% return, yet its total shareholder return of \u20139.1% is less negative thanks to a healthy dividend stream.  The bank\u2019s fundamentals show flat revenue but improving earnings, a modest 6.8% projected earnings growth and 4.1% revenue growth, while its return on equity is expected to stay low at about 5.7%.  Despite a solid dividend, the bank\u2019s share price performance and volatility remain below the Canadian banking sector average, and analysts flag limited upside potential.  The article also notes that Trump\u2019s 2025 fossil\u2011fuel policies are boosting midstream oil and gas companies, listing 22 firms that could benefit from accelerated pipeline and LNG infrastructure projects.",
