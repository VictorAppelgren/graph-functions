  "content": "Fog machines are an underrated and, frankly, underutilized device when it comes to Halloween hijinks. An intelligently placed fog machine can serve as the finishing touch to your otherwise perfectly executed holiday display\u2014one could even argue it can tie the entire haunted house together.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a pretty niche subset of decor to really become an expert in. There\u2019s a lot of trial and error involved, and in a pretty oversaturated market, there are arguably too many devices to choose from. Whether you\u2019re looking to accentuate your favorite Halloween animatronics or perfectly light up your front yard for trick-or-treaters, you should at least consider a budget-friendly machine.\n\nIf you\u2019re a musician or frequently host shindigs at your home, you might want to opt for something a little more versatile and hardworking. While most fog machines operate similarly and are typically easy to set up, there is still a wide range of products on the market. They come in various sizes and price points, and while some produce a simple cloud of fog, others offer special effects, such as low-lying fog or LED light shows.\n\nAlas, we found some of the best fog machines on the market for all types of use cases. Whether you\u2019re hosting a Monster Mash or a Disco Date Night, there are plenty of high-end options to choose from. Either way, we\u2019ll point you in the right direction. Let\u2019s go through some of our favorites, along with some tips and tricks (pun intended) on picking the perfect fog machine for Halloween and beyond.\n\nLooking for more Halloween display products and tips?

      "text": "Halloween is a great time to put your DIY skills to use so that you can make and hang your own decorations. From scary lights, to duct-tape cords, these tips will help keep your creepiest props and decorations secure through the scary season (and provide a fun thrill for your trick-or-treaters).\nWant more best-in-class DIY tips? Join our squad.\n1) Get Some Zip Ties\nIf you're hanging many strings of bright orange lights, then invest a few bucks in a package of zip ties. They come in a variety of sizes and colors. Match the color to whatever you are securing them to so they are more discrete. They can secure your lights to deck railings, porch banisters, fences, or tree branches. They require only seconds to attach, hold the strings tightly in place, and won't damage your surface with nail holes. Plus, they're cheap. To remove the zip ties, use strong scissors or a utility knife.\n2) Use All-Purpose Light Clips\nWant to hang pumpkin-colored lights from your gutters? You'll want a few of these all-purpose clips. They're inexpensive (about $7 for a 100-pack) and they look a heck of a lot better than clothespins. If you don't have gutters, don't worry\u2014the all-purpose clips also attach to shingles.\n3) Buy Duct Tape Cords\nIdeally, you want to keep extension and power cords off sidewalks, hallways, or anywhere people walk. But sometimes it's unavoidable. If you must, use duct tape to secure your cords to the surface; it'll reduce the chances of people tripping since they won't be able to hook their toes under the cords.\n4) Invest in a Light-Hanging Pole\nBefore you hang strings of lights in those trees in your front yard, buy a light-hanging pole. It eliminates the need for a ladder, and you can still get the lights onto the highest branches. This is a convenient and safe way to hang lights that won't put you at risk of falling.\n5) Rely on a Timer\nYou don't want to sit up in bed at 2 a.m. in the morning and realize you forgot to unplug your Halloween lights. Save yourself the chilly trip outside in your jammies by putting your lights on an outdoor timer, which will allow you to deactivate the display at preset times. Basic timers start at about $10; you can spend more on a fancy one with a digital display. Photoelectric timers are ideal as they come on when the sun sets so you don't have to continually adjust your timer as the season progresses.\n6) Leverage Your Outlets\nYou probably have more than one outside outlet, so don't pull a Clark Griswold and plug all your lights into a single outlet. As a general rule, avoid plugging more than three strings of lights together. Always use outdoor-approved cables and plugs.\n7) Support Your Props\nWith those ghosts, skeletons, witches, and zombies, you'll get the most scream for your buck by hanging them from trestles or awnings and letting them blow in the chilly October breeze. Just be sure to support their extra weight. One smart way to do this is to use fishing line, which is strong, easy to work with, and invisible at night. Test the strength of the fishing line so you know it can support the weight.\n8) Make Double-Sided Tape Your Friend\nDouble-sided tape works great for adhering decorations to windows or your front door. You can secure the edges of your kids' Halloween projects or store-bought spiders or ghosts so that they won't get damaged or torn by the wind.\n9) Set Up Some Creepy Siding\nYou can attach lights or lightweight monsters to vinyl siding using hooks that cost about $7 for a set of three. They eliminate the need to punch holes in the siding with nails, and they don't leave you stuck with the residue left behind by tape. The hooks slide into place under the vinyl and attach to the lip\u2014you don't even need any tools.\n10) Remember to Practice Ladder Safety\nBefore you decorate your home for Halloween, Christmas, or any other occasion, remember to be smart on your ladder.\nStep 1: Make sure the ladder is stable on a flat, level surface. If your yard is not flat, balance the ladder by placing long boards under one of the legs (don't use a small object such as a brick, since the leg can easily slip off). Check that the boards are secured and won't slip.\nStep 2: Strap the strings of lights to your work belt before getting on the ladder so that your hands will be free for climbing.\nStep 3: Avoid using metal ladders around electrical wires to eliminate the chance of a shock. Move the ladder often instead of leaning off it. We know, moving the ladder frequently is a pain, but not as much as the pain you'll feel if you fall off. And remember, it's always a good idea to have a second person to assist you while doing any jobs that require a ladder.\n\ud83c\udfa5 Now Watch This:\nTimothy is a lifelong DIY enthusiast who is fixated on smart home tech, beautiful tools, and wrenching on his FJ62 Land Cruiser.

      "text": "If you want to create a simple light display for your yard that screams \"Happy Halloween,\" then the casual string of orange pumpkin-shaped lights is a good place to start. But if you're looking to knock the socks off of your trick-or-treaters and have the scariest yard on the block, you're in the right place.\n\ud83c\udf83 Love DIY projects? Join Pop Mech Pro for more expert-backed tips and tricks.\nUsing lighting to your advantage is key to creating an eerie ambiance. With different colors and shadowing techniques, you can create a scary space perfect for some solid Halloween thrills. So without further ado, here are five ways to set up Halloween lights in your yard.\n1) Create Eerie Shadows\nTo make shadows loom large and creepy, place lights low to the ground and aim them slightly upward. The angle will produce elongated, deformed shadows when anyone (or anything) passes in front of the light. Even the family dog will cast a frightful shadow. If you want to create more specific shadow effects, paint or partially cover lenses, or position cutouts or other figures in front of the lights.\n2) Add Some Creepy Colors\nChoose your colors wisely. Black lights are a Halloween classic, and you can have lots of fun with a black light on the front porch, but they tend to be more silly than scary. Dark blue lights are a more effective way to create a mystical scene\u2014moviemakers often use dark blue lights for moonlit nights or dark interior scenes, for example. Hang a dark blue bulb in your porch-light fixture to turn your front porch into a shadowy dungeon, or use dark blue floodlights to bathe your front yard in eerie moonlight, which makes the perfect lighting for a graveyard display.\n3) Use Flickering Flames\nFire is a great way to create chilling ambiance. The flickering orange light seems to deepen nearby shadows, and it makes them move and shift (or is that just something hiding in the darkness?) Use a candle inside a classic jack-o'-lantern, which can cast some truly unnerving shadows if carved and positioned properly.\nYou could also line your walkway with tiki torches, or just station a couple on either side of your porch. Make sure your open flames are positioned safely\u2014away from where people will walk\u2014and will not be a hazard. If you're not sure, you can always use flickering orange lights or electronic candles.\n4) Try Scary Strobe Lights\nResist the temptation to overuse strobe lights. Not only are they headache-inducing (and potentially dangerous for trick-or-treaters with epilepsy), they may look gimmicky if not executed just right. Instead, to create a sense of confusion or to suggest motion in a display, try flickering light, or a light that flashes at more random, slower intervals.\n5) Don't Forget Fog\nAchieve the best and scariest possible Halloween lighting with a fog machine. Flashing or moving lights at various levels can suggest spirits moving around, or something with glowing eyes lurking in the fog.\nYou can also create some cool effects with track lighting on the ground, where the color will be reflected and spread in the surrounding fog. Use it to create an eerie glow arising from a decorative grave or a trail of blood running from a gory display. Red lights are a good way to hint at blood, and bright green can make your fog look radioactive or poisonous."

We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?\nIf you want to take your Halloween decorating to the next level, your best bet is to invest in a few animatronics to throw into the mix. Anything that moves, lights up, speaks\u2014or all three\u2014is bound to impress, plus it adds some low-key, haunted house vibes to your neighborhood for some family-friendly entertainment.\nA good Halloween animatronic has fluid movement that\u2019s designed for a scare instead of a sloppy, obviously fake style. Many of the best options are motion-activated to provide a spook just as someone walks by.\nWhether you\u2019re planning to go all out and transform your front yard into a (tasteful) mini theme park or you want to decorate the porch for trick-or-treaters, read on for our top picks for the best Halloween animatronics on the market.\nNeed more Halloween d\u00e9cor for your home? Check out our picks for the best fog machines and pumpkin carving kits.\nThe Best Halloween Animatronics\n- Best Overall: Haunted Hill Farm Life-Size Animatronic Reaper\n- Best Phantom: Seasonal Visions Wailing Phantom\n- Best Scarecrow: Sheerlund Creepy Scarecrow\n- Best Zombie: Haunted Hill Farm Life-Size Animatronic Zombie Maid\n- Best Doll: Best Choice Products Roaming Doll\nWhat to Consider\nBudget\nNo matter what your budget, you\u2019ll need a game plan for how to design your Halloween decorations. Sure, you can spend all your cash on one giant animatronic zombie for the front yard\u2014which is bound to attract a certain sort of attention\u2014but if you want to fully outfit your yard, front hall, porch, or basement, the best way to do so is by creating multiple focal points at different heights to draw the eye.\nFor example, you\u2019ll want a mix of tall and ground-level freestanding animatronics, plus hanging ones to complete the look. If you need practical tips to get the job done, here\u2019s our deep dive on installing Halloween decorations.\nAs a general rule, the more sophisticated the animatronic, the higher the price tag\u2014some cost $300 or more. That said, there are plenty of low- and mid-range options available at multiple price points, starting at roughly $25, with several that fall into the $50 to $75 category and a few hovering around $100.\nWeather Resistance\nThe majority of the Halloween animatronics in our story are appropriate for indoor and outdoor use, but note that none are truly waterproof. As such, we recommend keeping them under cover on a porch or beneath an overhang, for example, especially when inclement weather is on the way.\nPower Source\nConsider whether the animatronics you buy are battery-operated or have plug-in adapters that will work with your setup. This is especially key if you plan on scattering them out in your front lawn or away from nearby power outlets. However, what plug-in options lack in portability, they make up for in reliable power and frights every single night.\nBattery operated choices typically won\u2019t last the full season on one battery pack\u2014you might need new batteries if one of your animatronics starts drooping a bit.\nHow We Selected\nWe recommend classic Halloween characters\u2014the zombie, the witch, the creepy clown, and the vampire\u2014as well as a few lesser-known (but no less creepy) choices. We made our final choices based on the design, movement, and potential for frights. At the same time, we researched customer reviews to ensure these monsters pass more than the eye test.\nTom Price is a Reviews Editor for Popular Mechanics and Runner's World while also contributing to Best Products and Bicycling.

On a more granular level, you\u2019ll want to look out for the number of bulbs per strip and the brightness level, expressed in kelvin, which is abbreviated with a \u201cK.\u201d Finally, light sets are often dimmable and controlled via remote or via Bluetooth with an app.\nHow We Chose\nOur selection includes LED strip light sets with average reviewer ratings of four stars or higher, and the majority are 4.5 stars or more.

      "text": "The 8 Best Christmas Net Lights for Easy Holiday Decorating\nAvoid the tangled collection of single-strand Christmas lights and opt for these net lights instead.\nGear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?\nStringing Christmas lights on your holiday tree can be a fun family activity to get you into the spirit of the holidays, but decorating outdoors can be a whole other beast.\nLuckily, someone was clever enough to invent Christmas net lights, which are designed in a grid or mesh pattern that makes them ideal for blanketing over bushes, hedges, fences, and trees. Traditional string lights usually have to be individually wrapped or woven between objects, but net lights can be quickly distributed over a surface. That way, it\u2019s easier to get a more uniform look with minimal effort.\nNet lights can vary in features, power sources, and how resistant they are to the elements. To help you in your search, we\u2019ve created a lineup of our top picks, along with expert advice to make your holiday decorating a breeze this year.\nThe Best Christmas Net Lights\n- Best Overall: Waterglide Outdoor Christmas Net Lights\n- Best for Balconies: Dingfu Hanging Christmas Net Lights\n- Best Battery Powered: EaseSolies 100 Christmas Net Lights (2-Pack)\n- Best for Small Bushes: Hishiny 100 Christmas Net Lights\n- Best for Larger Bushes: Vicila Christmas Net Mesh Lights\nWhat to Consider\nDimensions\nSince the hope with net lights is to eliminate the need for multiple sets of string lights and save on time, start with the dimensions. Net grids are either square or diamond-shaped, and can vary in size. Some might only offer enough surface coverage to light a bush or two, while others can cover an entire part of your lawn. Although it may not be exact, it\u2019s essential to find a set that\u2019s as close as possible to the dimensions of the area you plan to decorate.\nPower Source\nAs for power source, there are plug-in, solar, and battery options available. Battery-powered net lights could save you some money on your electric bill, but might not last as long, especially if you\u2019re planning to run them for several hours throughout the day. Plug-ins offer easy setup and accessibility, and some of our lights on this list can even be controlled directly from the power source for even more convenience. Solar-powered net lights don't require any electricity to run, but they may not be as vibrant as lights that have constant access to power.\nBulb Type\nThere are two main types of light bulbs that you see in Christmas lights: incandescent and LED. Incandescent lights offer that warm, cozy glow typically associated with holiday decor, while LEDs have a more blue-white tone.\nLEDs get some gripe because of the cool tone, but they are more energy-efficient and can last longer than incandescents. Based on our research on top contenders and in-house experience with LED Christmas lights, the majority of our recommendations on this list are made with LEDs.\nIP Rating\nAn IP rating determines how well a piece of equipment can resist water, dust, and weather damage. All outdoor lights usually fall between IP44 and IP65, with IP65 being the most ideal rating because it means the set is completely water- and dust-proof. If you live in an area that only experiences moderate weather, a mid-range IP rating protects your devices. But if you experience a lot of winter weather, like rain, snow, and sleet, then opt for a set of net lights with a higher IP rating.\nEnd-to-End Connection\nSets with end-to-end wire connection are ideal for covering more surface area. This type of connectivity is crucial for decorating large hedges or trees without power strips. Almost all of the Christmas net light we write about offer end-to-end connection.\nHow We Selected\nWe first reviewed our guides to the best Christmas lights and the best solar powered Christmas lights to determine what criteria would be useful to assess net lights, like IP rating and bulb type. Our selection includes lights in a range of sizes to suit small and large installation projects, as well as the best plug-in, solar-powered, and battery-operated sets. We surveyed the market, and called upon our own hands-on experience to find the best options based on color variety, features, and accessibility.

      "text": "- An Ohio man has come up with a creative way to celebrate Halloween with trick-or-treaters in the age of COVID-19: a DIY candy chute.\n- In 2020, Andrew Beattie repurposed an old shipping tube to create a candy chute that will keep him at least six feet away from the trick-or-treaters who visit his home on Halloween.\n- Beattie also recommends wearing gloves and handing out candy from newly opened packages to minimize contact and lower the risk of infection.\nAndrew Beattie didn\u2019t let COVID-19 crush his holiday spirit last year. When he considered the problem facing many festive homeowners\u2014how to safely deliver candy to trick-or-treaters\u2014the Cincinnati, Ohio resident used his DIY ingenuity to come up with a creative solution: a DIY candy chute. As we approach our third holiday season amid the pandemic, his design still stands the test of time (and safety).\n\ud83d\udd28 You love badass builds. So do we. Let\u2019s get our hands dirty together.\nUsing only a cardboard shipping tube, orange spray paint, black duct tape, and a string of lights, Beattie came up with a super simple, perfectly PopMech way to dole out goodies while adhering to social distancing rules.\nWhile Beattie used the shipping tube for a 6-by-8-foot photo backdrop he ordered from Amazon to make his chute, you can find similar-sized tubes practically anywhere shipping materials are sold, and even \u201cfrom carpet and material stores\u2014sometimes for free,\u201d he tells Popular Mechanics.\nFrom there, Beattie made a sign that hangs at the end of the chute telling trick-or-treaters to \u201cplace buckets here,\u201d so they know exactly where their treats will come from. He says this also helps everyone stay healthy, since it\u2019s a \u201ctouch-free experience.\u201d\nIf you can\u2019t grab new gear, just raid your garage. \u201cUse what you already have when possible,\u201d Beattie suggests. \u201cReusing what would otherwise be thrown away is good for the environment and your wallet, so it\u2019s a win-win.\u201d\n\ud83c\udf83 Make Your Own DIY Candy Chute\nWant to make your own candy chute? Follow these simple instructions:\n- Purchase or find used shipping tube.\n- Spray paint the shipping tube orange (or another festive color).\n- Attach the painted shipping tube to your banister with duct tape.\n- String rope lights around the banister and tube.\n- Let the good times (and candy) roll!\nTo further protect the trick-or-treaters in his neighborhood, Beattie will wear a face mask and gloves, and will be handing out candy \u201cdirectly into the chute from a newly opened bag,\u201d he says.\nThe best part: You can continue to bust out the candy chute for future Halloweens, even once the pandemic subsides.\n\u201cThis is something that can be stashed away easily and reused year after year,\u201d Beattie says. \u201cEven when the pandemic has passed, folks with mobility issues will appreciate not having to navigate steps to get close enough to you, as will those who are immunocompromised.\u201d\nDon\u2019t forget to tag us if you make your own chute!"
