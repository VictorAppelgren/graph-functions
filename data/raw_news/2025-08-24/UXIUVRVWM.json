  "content": "BURTON TOWNSHIP, Ohio \u2014 A 68-year-old woman is dead and a 69-year-old man was injured in an early-morning house fire Sunday in Geauga County.\n\nA news release from the Burton Volunteer Fire Department says the fire at the single-story home on the 14000 block of Erwin Drive was reported just before 4 a.m. The man at the home was able to escape the fire but the woman was trapped inside, officials say.\n\nLight smoke was coming from the back of the home when firefighters arrived. Attempts to rescue the woman were hindered because a door was blocked and by \u201cextreme clutter,\u201d the news release says.\n\nOnce firefighters found the woman, they got her out of the home through a bedroom window.\n\nBoth the man and woman were taken to a hospital for treatment. The woman died at the hospital of her injuries. The man was listed in stable condition Sunday, according to the fire department.\n\nTwo dogs in the home were rescued and revived by firefighters. Fire departments from several nearby communities also responded to the scene.\n\nThe cause of the fire is under investigation by the State Fire Marshal\u2019s Office. It\u2019s estimated the house had $160,000 in damage.",
