      "summary": "Israeli gunfire reportedly killed at least 25 people in Gaza as they sought aid, amid Prime Minister Netanyahu's plans for a military offensive in densely populated areas. Netanyahu suggested allowing Palestinians to leave Gaza voluntarily, a move criticized as potential ethnic cleansing. Meanwhile, ceasefire talks have resumed, but Israel has no plans to participate, and discussions about relocating Palestinians to South Sudan have been denied by South Sudanese officials. The ongoing conflict has resulted in significant casualties and humanitarian crises, with over 61,700 Palestinians reported killed.",
