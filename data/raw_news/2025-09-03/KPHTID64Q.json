  "content": "Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn when you read this story.\n\u2022 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 and Z06 models are being recalled due to a fire risk during refueling.\n\u2022 Should fuel make it past the fuel-filler neck, a cooling fan could potentially blow spilled fuel onto the hot engine\u2014potentially causing a fire.\n\u2022 Dealers will be able to install an insert or shield behind the fuel-filler neck to prevent spilled gasoline from coming into contact with the engine. It\u2019s unclear when this fix will be available to customers.\n\nIf you recently purchased an orange Corvette Z06 or ZR1 (or really any color for that matter) there\u2019s a risk your car could potentially become more orange. Chevrolet voluntarily recalled both specifications of its supercar after discovering that a cooling fan near the fuel filler cap could potentially blow errant errant towards the hot engine and combust. The issue affects 2023-2026 Chevrolet Corvette Z06s and 2025-2026 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1s in North America. GM has also announced a stop-sale order for existing vehicles at dealerships.\n\nlists the issue as follows:\n\n\u201cGeneral Motors has decided that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety may exist in certain 2023 \u2013 2026 model year Chevrolet Corvette vehicles equipped with a left-side radiator/fan combination. In these vehicles, excess fuel spilled into the vehicle fuel-filler pocket during refueling may leak onto an ignition source.\u201d\n\nWhat To Do If You Own an Affected Vehicle\n\nChevrolet is still working on a solution for the currently open recall affecting the Z06 and ZR1 Corvettes. Thankfully, there are some best practices you can follow to prevent the issue from happening.\n\nSpilled gasoline during refueling is a catalyst for the issue, which means this is pretty easy to fix. If you can believe it, the Corvette owners\u2019 manual\u2014and those in all modern automobiles\u2014include fueling instructions. Here are the critical instructions as listed by GM:\n\u2022 ALWAYS CONFIRM THAT THE FUEL NOZZLE IS COMPLETELY INSERTED INTO THE VEHICLE\u2019S FUEL PIPE BEFORE FUELING\n\u2022 NEVER OVERFILL THE TANK OR ATTEMPT TO FILL AFTER THE FUEL PUMP\u2019S AUTOMATIC SHUT-OFF CLICKS ONCE\n\u2022 ALWAYS TURN OFF THE VEHICLE\u2019S ENGINE DURING REFUELING.\n\nNHTSA hasn\u2019t released an exact figure for the number of vehicles affected, but many outlets have suggested that around 25,000 ZR1 and Z06 Corvettes could be impacted. While our friends at have confirmed only a couple of hundred ZR1s have been made, confirms a total of 25,500 Z06 Vettes have rolled off the assembly line. Critically, not all C8 Corvettes are affected by the current recall\u2014Stingrays and E-Rays are currently unaffected.\n\nGM\u2019s repair description indicates that dealers will install an insert shield behind the fuel filler neck to prevent spilled gasoline from coming into contact with hot engine components. Unfortunately, the part isn\u2019t currently available, and there\u2019s no target date for when you\u2019ll be able to get your vehicle fixed. Until then, you\u2019ll just need to be extra careful at the pump.",

      "text": "With all the talk about the new 2025 Corvette ZR1 ordering opening up and production starting in 2nd Quarter, we wanted to take a look to see a breakdown of how the current 2025 Corvette models are being produced. We are about six months into the production of the 2025 models and if recent reports hold up, the model year will run through the end of May.\nCurrently, Chevrolet is producing three models at the Corvette Assembly Plant in Bowling Green, KY. Those models are the base Stingray, as well as two widebody models called the Z06 and E-Ray.\nUtilizing Roger Kiel\u2019s daily production spreadsheet, we see that Chevrolet has produced 14,740 Corvettes for the 2025 model year as of February 9th. The current breakdown in production for the Corvettes is: 63.3% Stingray (9,329), 27.2% Z06 (4,008), and 9.5% E-Ray (1,403).\nAnd for a comparison, here is the 2024 Corvette Production by Model. Chevrolet produced 42,934 Corvettes for the 2024 model year, which is broken down as 72.1% Stingray (30,942), 24.6% Z06 (10,575) and 3.3% E-Ray (1,417).\nComparing the two model years, the Z06 and E-Ray models have both increased their share of production year-over-year. The new E-Ray has nearly reached the Corvette Team\u2019s goal of being 10% of C8 orders while the Z06 is now up to just over 27% in its third year of production.\nFrom 2024 to 2025, the Stingray saw its share of production drop by nearly 9%. That\u2019s a good thing as the Stingray market has become oversaturated with dealer stock orders, which is leading to dealerships heavily discounting the C8\u2019s entry model.\nWhen the 2025 Corvette ZR1s do start up, we aren\u2019t expecting too many in terms of quantities during this initial ramp up phase. Our guess is that somewhere between 300-500 ZR1s will be completed in its inaugural year, and the impact on current production of the other three models will most likely be negligible during the ramp up phase.\nSource:\nRoger Kiel\u2019s Daily Production Tracker / Facebook\nRelated:\nChevrolet\u2019s Live Inventory Tracker Shows 6,126 On the Ground as of February 1st\n[VIDEO] Important 2025 and 2026 Corvette Model Year Ordering and Production Dates Announced\n[VIDEO] First Saleable Production 2025 Corvette ZR1s Have Been Completed in Bowling Green\nSubscribe Now:\nGonna be hard to argue with the E-Ray being a collector car, if GM can\u2019t build more than 3,000 total\u2026\nI know part of life is getting old but should G.M. in the ordering process allow senior citizens to move up the line because of their age.\n@James\nNo, not really. Being old is practically a prerequisite for the bulk of traditional Corvette owners. The oldest of them have probably had the opportunity to buy multiple Corvettes (and have) over the years. No special consideration should be paid. If time is of the essence, buy something used.\nIsn\u2019t the Eray a Grandsport in disguise?\nThere will be high demand for the ZR1. Lets hope chevy decides to produce as many as possible so that every person that wants one can buy it.\nComments are closed."

      "text": "Lest you think things couldn\u2019t get any worse for Tesla in 2025, the automaker just announced a recall on the Cybertruck, claiming one of the stainless steel body panels could come detached while driving.\nThis is the eighth recall the stainless-clad vehicle has collected in the mere two years it\u2019s been on the road. But unlike many of its previous offenses, this is one of the first significant body repairs that can\u2019t be addressed with a simple over-the-air update.\nThe recall affects 46,096 Cybertrucks manufactured between November 2023 and late February 2025.\nWhat Is the Issue?\nThe issue stems from something called the cantrail, a strip of stainless steel trim glued to the exterior of the vehicle that runs along the windshield and the roof. The recall noted that environmental conditions may have compromised the adhesive used to keep the trim piece attached to the vehicle. While it might sound blasphemous for Tesla to use adhesive instead of fasteners, many automakers have made this standard practice, claiming considerable weight savings and improved structural integrity.\nThe recall says the adhesive showed signs of \u201cenvironmental embrittlement,\u201d which causes causes materials to lose their ductility, making them prone to cracking and failure.\nWhat Is the Fix?\nAs such a large body panel coming loose poses considerable risk to other motorists, Tesla voluntarily recalled the Cybertruck on March 11, 2025. The fix is fairly straightforward: attaching a new cantrail with the proper adhesive that \u201cisn\u2019t susceptible to environmental embrittlement.\u201d Along with using the correct sticky stuff, Tesla also plans to add redundancy, welding a threaded metal stud to the panel that clamps onto the vehicle with a nut.\nTo offer some perspective on the Cybertruck\u2019s recall history, here\u2019s a look at its last seven infractions:\nCybertrucks by the Numbers\nIn an ironic twist of fate, this latest recall gives us great insight into just how many Cybertrucks Tesla has sold to customers. As the recall window overlaps most of the truck\u2019s lifetime, we can confidently assume that Tesla has delivered fewer than 50,000 units. Following initial claims of a million reservations and the manufacturing muscle to build 500,000 Cybertrucks a year, Tesla has achieved less than 10 percent of their production target.\nHowever, with so few Cybertrucks on the road, this could actually prove to be a fairly straightforward and rapid fix for Tesla to rectify. If we look at some of the issues and numbers other automakers are dealing with, it\u2019s clear things could be a lot worse. For context, Ford had to fix dodgy fuel pumps on 295,000 of its Super Duty trucks.\nAs of March 14, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says Tesla has identified 151 Cybertruck warranty claims that could be related to the recall.\nMatt Crisara is a native Austinite who has an unbridled passion for cars and motorsports, both foreign and domestic.
