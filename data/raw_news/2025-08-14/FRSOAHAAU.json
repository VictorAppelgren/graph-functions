  "content": "Former Delaware Gov. Mike Castle, a Republican moderate who championed creating the popular 50 State Quarters Program of commemorative coins while he served in Congress, has died.\n\nThe Delaware Republican Party announced that Castle died Thursday in Greenville but shared no other details.\n\nCastle was among Delaware\u2019s most successful politicians, never losing a race until his stunning upset in a 2010 primary for the U.S. Senate seat that Democrat Joe Biden held before becoming vice president.\n\nDuring his 18 years in Congress, Castle became a leader of centrist Republicans, earning a reputation as a fiscal conservative and social moderate not afraid to challenge the party line on issues ranging from government spending to environmental protection and abortion.\n\nAs Delaware\u2019s lone representative in the U.S. House from 1993 to 2011, he supported a pay-as-you-go policy for both spending and tax cuts.\n\nCastle played roles in improving child nutrition programs and establishing the No Child Left Behind education reform program.\n\nHis signature issue in Congress was the commemorative quarters program that featured coins honoring each state, starting with Delaware.\n\nHe was dubbed by the coin grading service Numismatic Guaranty Company as \u201cThe Coinage Congressman.\u201d\n\nThe quarters boosted federal revenues as they were taken out of circulation.\n\nHe also helped establish a similar program honoring U.S. presidents with dollar coins, beginning in 2007, and an \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d quarter program honoring national parks, monuments and nature areas starting in 2010.\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Michael Castle embodied the best of public service \u2014 moderation, integrity, and a steadfast commitment to all Delawareans,\u201d Delaware GOP Chairman Gene Truono said in a statement Thursday.\n\nCastle had been a state lawmaker and lieutenant governor before becoming governor in 1985.\n\nDelaware Gov. Matt Meyer ordered flags flown at half-staff for the next week in Castle\u2019s honor.\n\n\u201cDuring his time as governor, Mike Castle visited every single school in our state, including mine, where he spoke to my high school class with the same warmth, humility, and commitment to public service that defined his career,\u201d said Meyer, a Democrat.",

Our hearts go out to Chief Nate Hill, his wife and family for the loss of their little girl, who was victim of a dog attack,\u201d Burlington Police Department said.\nEmergency medical personnel rushed the child to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.\nThe German shepherd was taken to the Burlington dog pound and euthanized, police said.\nDraco had been a single-purpose narcotics detection K-9 for the Cheyenne County Sheriff\u2019s Office, but was non-active at the time of the deadly attack, Kit Carson Sheriff Travis Beldon said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s trained for detection. He\u2019s not in any way trained for patrol work, apprehension, anything that would involve biting \u2026 So it is very uncharacteristic for him to attack in this fashion,\u201d he told KENS5.\nThe dog was used as recently as June 19 for a traffic stop to detect controlled substances, according to a Cheyenne County Sheriff\u2019s Office press statement.\nHe had recently been retired from duty after Cheyenne County discontinued its K-9 program, and was donated to the Burlington Police Department.\nHill was keeping the dog at his home at the time of the attack, police said."

      "text": "White House scrapped Biden ship tour after learning \u2018how many steps were involved,\u2019 emails show\nThe White House opted against having former President Joe Biden board a vessel during a July 2023 visit to a Philadelphia shipyard after learning \u201clots of steps\u201d were required to get on board, newly released emails show.\nThe records, obtained by watchdog group Protect the Public\u2019s Trust via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and first reported by Fox News, show Department of Transportation staffers attempting to gather information about Biden\u2019s July 20, 2023, trip to the Philly Shipyard and what the president would be doing during his visit.\nThe DOT\u2019s Maritime Administration (MARAD) had awarded the Philly Shipyard a contract to build a massive National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV) years earlier \u2013 but the agency learned days before Biden\u2019s trip that the White House would not allow the then-80-year-old president to inspect the boat.\n\u201cNo visit to the NSMV vessel is planned after the WH realized how many steps were involved to get on the ship,\u201d a MARAD official notified members of Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST), quoting a contact the agency had at that shipyard.\n\u201cTrue \u2013 lots of steps on grating,\u201d the message continued in a parenthetical note.\nBiden\u2019s visit to the Philly Shipyard (PSI), where he met with apprentices and attended a steel-cutting ceremony for an offshore wind farm construction vessel, came just weeks after he took a hard fall at an Air Force Academy graduation ceremony in Colorado.\nSince the fall, the president had been observed boarding Air Force One using the aircraft\u2019s shorter set of stairs.\nSeven days before the Philadelphia shipyard visit, Biden stumbled on Air Force One\u2019s short staircase as he prepared to depart Helsinki-Vantaan International Airport in Finland.\nThe White House\u2019s refusal to let Biden board the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel in Philadelphia may not have been the only time the president wasn\u2019t allowed to get on a boat over concerns about the number of steps involved.\nFormer British Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed in his autobiography, \u201cUnleashed,\u201d that the White House would not allow Biden to board the British Navy\u2019s flagship aircraft carrier \u2013 the HMS Prince of Wales \u2013 ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in Cornwall.\nThe decision left Johnson questioning Biden\u2019s \u201cphysical fitness.\u201d\n\u201cHis staff told us that he would not in fact be boarding our vast aircraft carrier \u2014 which we had proudly stationed in the bay \u2014 because it had so many steps; and we wondered what that meant about his physical fitness,\u201d Johnson said, according to an excerpt from the former prime minister\u2019s book obtained by The Telegraph."

Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\u201d she added. \u201cYou will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\u201d\nDunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division \u2014 which handles cases of fugitives abroad and helps foreign countries on extradition matters with their own fugitives, according to the DOJ.\nDunn appeared to have been similar to a paralegal \u2014 assisting attorneys in handling a \u201clarge volume of cases, including the litigation of those matters,\u201d according to the DOJ\u2019s job listing for the position.\nHe does not appear to be an attorney as his name isn\u2019t listed on the DC bar\u2019s website.\nAn attorney for the suspect did not immediately respond to requests for comment and attempts to contact Dunn directly were unsuccessful.\nDunn was allegedly caught on camera berating a group of federal officers as \u201cfascists\u201d before lobbing his deli sandwich and hitting a US Customs and Border Protection agent in the chest.\n\u201cF\u2014 you! You f\u2014ing fascists! Why are you here? I don\u2019t want you in my city!\u201d Dunn allegedly fumed within inches of an officer\u2019s face, per a criminal complaint.\nAccording to the complaint, Dunn successfully attempted to flee on foot, telling a local cop while he was being processed: \u201cI did it. I threw a sandwich.\u201d\nFootage of the incident went viral against the backdrop of President Trump\u2019s deployment of hundreds of federal law enforcement personnel to assist DC police in cracking down on crime.\nDunn faces one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer and faces up to one year in prison if convicted.\n\u201cThe police are not out there to get pushed around or beat up,\u201d DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro declared in announcing the case against Dunn. \u201cHe thought it was funny. Well, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny today because we charged him with a felony: Assault on a police officer.\u201d\n\u201cSo there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else!\u201d\nOn Monday, Trump federalized the DC Metropolitan Police Department for 30 days and activated the National Guard to patrol the District\u2019s streets.\nSince then, hundreds of federal officials have arrested more than 100 suspects, with 23 collared on Monday, 43 nabbed on Tuesday and 45 apprehended on Wednesday, according to data from the Trump administration.\nTrump\u2019s crackdown comes after former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee Edward Coristine \u2014 aka \u201cBig Balls\u201d \u2014 was beaten up while intervening to prevent a carjacking last week."

And he\u2019s getting a helluva woman.\u201d\nKrein also served on the Biden Cancer Initiative\u2019s board of directors between 2017 and 2019, and advised his 2020 presidential campaign on its response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an unofficial capacity.\nAt last year\u2019s DNC in Chicago, Ashley Biden recounted her wedding day and discussed her father\u2019s words to her before she tied the knot.\n\u201cBefore he walked me down the aisle, he turned to me and said he would always be my best friend. All these years later, Dad, you are still my best friend,\u201d she said in an address that brought her father to tears."
