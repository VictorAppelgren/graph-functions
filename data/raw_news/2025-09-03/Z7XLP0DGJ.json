  "content": "OnePay is reportedly adding its own branded wireless plan as it works to become an American super app.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nThe FinTech company, which is majority-owned by Walmart, is making the service available within its app Wednesday (Sept. 3), in partnership with mobile services startup Gigs, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing a statement from Gigs and confirmation by OnePay.\n\nNeither OnePay nor Gigs immediately replied to PYMNTS\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThe plan provides unlimited 5G data, talk and text on the AT&T network for $35 a month, according to the CNBC report.\n\nThe new service joins the credit and debit cards, savings accounts, buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans, and digital wallet with peer-to-peer payments that are already available in the OnePay app, per the report.\n\nIn another recent addition to its app, OnePay said in June that it will launch a credit card program in partnership with Synchrony in the fall. PYMNTS reported at the time that the OnePay app serves as a digital front door through which general purpose and private-label cards (for Walmart purchases) will roll out.\n\n\u201cOur goal with this credit card program is to deliver an experience for consumers that\u2019s transparent, rewarding and easy to use,\u201d OnePay CEO Omer Ismail said at the time in a press release. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be partnering with Synchrony to launch a program at Walmart that checks each of those boxes and will help serve millions of people.\u201d\n\nIn March, the company added installment loans to its product portfolio as it began giving Walmart U.S. customers the option to use Klarna-powered OnePay loans to pay for items with repayments terms of three to 36 months. This offering resulted from Klarna agreeing to become Walmart\u2019s exclusive provider of installment loans, giving Walmart\u2019s customers in the U.S. access to flexible payment options.\n\nAs for Gigs, it raised $73 million in a Series B funding round in December, saying it would use the new funding to expand its geographical footprint and expand the products and services it offers tech companies.\n\nGigs Co-founder and CEO Hermann Frank said at the time in press release that Gigs enables \u201cany tech company to distribute phone plans directly through their apps, transforming connectivity from a standalone commodity into a core, customizable feature of every digital product experience.\u201d",

      "text": "In recent reports, we\u2019ve chronicled the growth in subscriptions used by consumers across both these firms, with more than 30% of consumers having a Walmart+ account.\nAs detailed in Walmart\u2019s SEC filings, the company has 1.6 million employees in the United States, pointing to an installed base of consumers and workers that represent a strong foundation with which to forge a financial services ecosystem.\nWalmart\u2019s FinTech efforts are now a bit more than four years old. In partnership with the Walmart-backed OnePay, the retailer has been busy with a string of announcements that take aim at banks and neobanks alike, in a nod to traditional financial products delivered digitally.\nWalmart consumers already have some familiarity with money movement as part of the range of services tied to Walmart. Walmart Money Centers have been staples of check cashing and remittances. The retailer\u2019s co-branded card with Capital One had $8.5 billion in loans at the time that Walmart exited that card pact last year.\nIn the latest announcement, on Monday (June 9), OnePay said it is teaming with Synchrony to launch a credit card program.\nThe OnePay app serves as a digital front door through which general propose and private-label cards (for Walmart purchases) will roll out beginning this fall. Synchrony, meanwhile, has long made a mark in private label cards.\nSingle Point of Access\nOnePay\u2019s own site details the offerings thus far accessible through the company\u2019s digital wallet, both online and in store, as consumers add debit and credit cards, and redeem rewards.\nAs for the digital wallets, PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s \u201cHow the World Does Digital\u201d series has documented that mobile wallets are tied to 35% of online and 21% of in-store transactions; a majority of consumers also use digital banking apps.\nThe synergies here come as the digital wallets serve as that gateway to a continuum of financial interactions. OnePay/Walmart said earlier this year that a partnership had been struck with buy now, pay later (BNPL) firm Klarna to offer installment loans at Walmart.\nThe moves come at a time when BNPL has been among the most widely embraced payment modalities. PYMNTS has estimated that BNPL transactions have hit the $175 billion mark, garnering enthusiasm across all income levels.\nWalmart, too, has seen an influx of higher income shoppers, with this demographic growing its footprint at big box stores. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted that the retailer continues to gain share among households earning over $100,000, which now account for 75% of Walmart\u2019s share gains in the U.S. toward the end of the year.\nComing into 2025, PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster detailed that the FinTechs and other digital only players would have to gird for turbulence.\n\u201c[OnePay], with Walmart, can use the connectivity they have with brands to disrupt the economics of how pure-play FinTechs make their money,\u201d Webster wrote in January. \u201cThat can become the basis for a disruptive business model that doesn\u2019t rely on investor checks to cover up shortfalls in positive unit economics. The sheer scale of their customer base and supplier relationships, and the ability to connect purchases with offers and financing, is unmatched by any except for one other retailer \u2014 Amazon \u2026 [OnePay] looks like it could be a winner, and highly disruptive.\u201d"

      "text": "The collaboration, announced Monday (March 17), gives Walmart\u2019s customers in the U.S. access to flexible payment options in an arrangement set to be integrated into the retailer\u2019s checkout this year.\nA Klarna news release notes that OnePay, the consumer financial services platform backed by Walmart and Ribbit Capital, is already part of Walmart\u2019s physical and digital channels. With this partnership, OnePay can now add installment loans to its product portfolio.\n\u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d Klarna Co-founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in the release.\n\u201cMillions of people in the U.S. shop at Walmart every day \u2014 and now they can shop smarter with OnePay installment loans powered by Klarna. OnePay choosing Klarna as their exclusive installment loans partner at Walmart in the U.S. is a huge vote of confidence as we pursue our goal of being available everywhere for everything.\u201d\nAccording to the release, the deal gives Walmart U.S. customers the option to use Klarna-powered OnePay loans to pay for items with repayment terms of 3 to 36 months.\nWalmart has had a long-standing buy now, pay later (BNPL) partnership with Klarna rival Affirm. That partnership is still in place as of Monday, Affirm said in a regulatory filing.\n\u201cWe win business when merchants want superior performance and maximum value, given our underwriting and capital markets advantages,\u201d an Affirm spokesperson told PYMNTS. \u201cWe will continue our long-term strategy of competing on our products and entering into sustainable partnerships.\u201d\nThe partnership comes days after Klarna announced it had filed paperwork for its long-awaited initial public offering (IPO).\nIn a letter included in the filing last week, Siemiatkowski wrote that the company\u2019s offerings, including its BNPL feature, have drawn almost 100 million users.\n\u201cIt is an amazingly diverse group of people with really one thing in common: their resentment of traditional banks,\u201d Siemiatkowski wrote.\n\u201cThey want simple and transparent fees. They want to avoid mishap fees. They want fixed and clear payoff horizons for major purchases. Ultimately, they want a bank that delivers trust by putting their interests first \u2014 and yes, preferably interest-free.\u201d\nThese developments are happening as consumers are embracing pay later plans as they seek out more flexible payment options. The PYMNTS Intelligence eBook \u201c10 Impact Statements: The 2024 Pay Later Report\u201d found these offerings are popular with both financially strapped consumers and more comfortable individuals.\n\u201cThe desire for easy, budget-friendly payment options is impacting how consumers approach large and small purchases,\u201d PYMNTS wrote recently.\n\u201cMany consumers, regardless of income level, used installment plans to streamline spending and preserve their cash reserves. These plans were seen as an effective way to manage spending without sacrificing immediate needs.\u201d"

      "text": "Gigs Raises $73 Million To Enable Tech Companies To Launch Their Own Mobile Service\nDec 12, 2024\n5 min\nRibbit Capital, known for backing such global fintech pioneers as Coinbase, Nubank, Robinhood, and Brex, led the round.\nWith the latest funding, Gigs cements its position as the go-to platform for tech companies seeking to embed mobile services into their offerings.\nSAN FRANCISCO, 12th of December 2024 \u2013 Gigs, the operating system for mobile services, today announced that it has raised a $73M Series B led by Ribbit Capital. All existing investors, including Google\u2019s Gradient, YC and Speedinvest participated in the round. Gigs will use the funding to expand its geographical footprint and invest in an expanded suite of products and services for tech companies. This will enable more tech brands to meaningfully innovate in telecom, provide more value to their customers, and tap into a new recurring revenue stream.\nThe Walled Garden Of Telecom\nBefore Gigs, high barriers to entry kept the telecom industry closed-off to innovators. New entrants faced years of tough commercial negotiations with carriers and had to pour tens of thousands of engineering hours into navigating the messy patchwork of single-purpose vendors with archaic, fragmented operating systems. Engineering teams had to wrestle with clunky, unstable and inconsistent APIs from multiple carriers\u2014like building tech from the early 2000s\u2014all just to enter one market.\nOn top of that, businesses were forced to commit more than $100 million upfront in order to achieve competitive rates from networks and get priority network access, all before selling a single subscription. These operational and capital expenses were hard to recoup and tied businesses to network-specific investments, ultimately hampering scalability and eroding margins.\nEven businesses capable of managing these burdens still faced the slow and bureaucratic processes of carriers, which hindered their ability to optimize in the long-run. Moreover, any plans to expand internationally required repeating the entire effort with each network operator\u2014an untenable challenge for technology platforms that don't consider telecom their core business.\nAs a result, the internet economy lacks the infrastructure and tools to connect to the global telecom grid, something tech companies take for granted in areas like hosting and payments.\nDemocratizing Access To The Mobile Service Market\nGigs is radically democratizing access to the mobile service industry. The company\u2019s mission is to reduce the cost of setting up a mobile service in one or multiple markets, as well as lowering operational and service costs to near zero. Without Gigs, it would take new entrants to the mobile service market years to develop and refine their service.\nThe company\u2019s operating system empowers tech players to launch their own mobile service on premium networks globally within weeks, all through a single integration\u2014eliminating the need to hire large teams of telecom engineers, navigate compliance hurdles, or manage multiple vendors and platforms. By providing everything you need to launch your own mobile service in one platform\u2014including premium wholesale connectivity, a best-in-class connectivity API, a hosted checkout, a multi-currency payments suite, a tax engine, a subscription and analytics platform, and AI-powered customer service\u2014Gigs removes the complexity, time-to-market, and costs for tech brands wanting to embed their own mobile services into their digital products and services.\nTo ensure customers maintain a competitive edge and operate state-of-the-art services with the highest customer satisfaction and lowest cost to serve globally, Gigs continuously productizes every aspect of its business and automates every customer support ticket. For the first time, this makes telecommunications accessible to tech companies that expect to work with modern tools and high-performance platforms.\nHermann Frank, co-founder and CEO at Gigs: \u201cWe believe that getting a phone plan should be as easy as ordering an Uber, not as complicated as leasing a car at a dealership. The truth, however, is that phone plans are stuck in the past: analog, uniform, and, frankly, unloved. Extremely high barriers to entry have kept innovation out of the industry for too long. Now, the world\u2019s leading product companies can bring this innovation to their users. Gigs breaks down these hurdles by empowering any tech company to distribute phone plans directly through their apps, transforming connectivity from a standalone commodity into a core, customizable feature of every digital product experience. Ribbit has a proven track record of upending markets burdened by incumbent lethargy. We were impressed by the team\u2019s vision so when the offer came to lead our Series B, it felt very natural to lean in.\u201d\nDennis Bauer, co-founder and President at Gigs: \u201cSince our launch in 2020, Gigs has significantly increased its annual recurring revenue, cementing its position as one of the fastest-growing B2B companies globally. Leading tech brands with large, highly engaged audiences\u2014ranging from high-growth neobanks like Nubank and Wealthsimple to major HR platforms, travel companies and phone manufacturers\u2014are leveraging Gigs' connectivity platform to integrate phone plans into their core services, delivering unique and seamless product experiences. With exciting new product launches and lighthouse customer announcements in 2025, Gigs is set to inspire even more innovative tech companies to launch their own mobile services.\u201d\nJordan Angelos, General Partner at Ribbit Capital: \u201cMobile connectivity, like banking, is one of the most widely used consumer services globally. Yet, it consistently ranks among the lowest in customer satisfaction. Gigs is seizing a once-in-a-decade opportunity to revolutionize the $1T+ annual mobile subscription market, empowering innovators and trusted brands to digitize and enhance customer experiences, with phone plans serving as the ultimate superglue. We are impressed by the team\u2019s vision, execution, and global momentum, and we\u2019re excited to partner with them on this journey.\u201d\nAbout Gigs\nGigs, the operating system for mobile services, empowers tech companies to seamlessly embed connectivity into their offerings in weeks. By bundling phone plans and travel data with their core services, Gigs' customers can increase stickiness and unlock a new recurring revenue stream with digital mobile experiences that meaningfully create value to consumers. Gigs' end-to-end platform provides everything brands need to launch and operate their own multi-market mobile service: premium wholesale connectivity, a hosted checkout, billing, subscription management, analytics, and AI-powered customer service.

      "text": "OnePay, the fintech firm majority owned by Walmart, is launching its own branded wireless plan as it seeks to become a one-stop shop for its users, CNBC has learned.\nOnePay Wireless will be available starting Wednesday in the OnePay app, according to Gigs, the mobile services startup that partnered with the company.\nThe plan costs $35 a month for unlimited 5G data, talk and text on the AT&T network, Gigs said. The plans are activated in-app with a few clicks and don't require credit checks or activation fees, the startup said.\nOnePay, created by Walmart in 2021 alongside venture firm Ribbit Capital, has methodically built out its offerings in a bid to become an American super app akin to overseas offerings like WeChat or Alipay. OnePay services include credit and debit cards, high-yield savings accounts, buy now, pay later loans, and a digital wallet with peer-to-peer payments.\nThe OnePay-Gigs partnership is the latest example of a fintech firm adding wireless connectivity to its product set; Klarna and Nubank have made similar announcements.\nOnePay confirmed the launch and declined to comment further.\nGigs CEO Hermann Frank said that embedding wireless plans into fintech services can lower AT&T's customer acquisition costs \u2014 savings which can be shared with end users.\n\"The average consumer largely overpays for their phone bill,\" Frank said. \"We can now offer a product at a price point that is about half what the typical consumer pays right now, with all the modern features that you require.\"\nThere is a \"growing pipeline\" of U.S. companies planning to offer their own wireless plans from Gigs and AT&T, according to a joint statement from the firms. Companies typically get a share of the revenue from these plans, Frank told CNBC.\n\"The future is one where consumers can buy and manage their cellular plans from any number of personal or workplace apps they use every day,\" William Traylor, AT&T's vice president of emerging business \u2013 platforms & partnerships said in the statement."

The launch, effective September\u202f3\u202f2025, aims to cut consumer costs and lower AT&T\u2019s customer acquisition expenses, potentially reshaping telecom pricing dynamics. This move signals a broader trend of fintech firms bundling connectivity, which could influence consumer spending patterns and pressure traditional telecom revenue streams.",
