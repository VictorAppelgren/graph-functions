  "description": "Busta Rhymes denies allegations made against him in a lawsuit filed by Dashiel Gables, calling it an \"attempted shake-down by a disgruntled former assistant.\"",
  "content": "Busta Rhymes, seen arriving at a reception after his Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony Aug. 1, is denying allegations made by a former assistant in a lawsuit filed Monday.\n\nBusta Rhymes is rejecting claims leveled against him in a lawsuit filed this week by a former assistant, calling it an \u201cattempted shake-down.\u201d\n\nDashiel Gables, who filed the lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, is accusing Rhymes \u2014 real name Trevor Smith Jr. \u2014 of wage and hour violations as well as assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n\u201cI have been made aware of the claims made by Dashiel Gables, and I completely and categorically deny these allegations,\u201d Rhymes said in a statement to The Times. \u201cFor a very brief period, Dashiel assisted me, but it did not work out. Apparently, Dashiel has decided to respond to being let go by manufacturing claims against me in an attempt to attack and damage my reputation.\u201d\n\nRhymes, 53, said he is preparing a countersuit and is \u201cconfident [it] will expose this for what it is \u2014 an attempted shake-down by a disgruntled former assistant.\u201d\n\nIn the lawsuit, which was reviewed by The Times, Gables alleges that Rhymes repeatedly called him a slur related to sexuality and mocked his poor hearing by telling him to \u201cget a hearing aid.\u201d He also says he was improperly categorized as a salaried employee and wasn\u2019t paid overtime despite allegedly being required to work 15-, 16- and 18-hour shifts regularly for a flat $200 a day.\n\nThe lawsuit says he was required to perform \u201cmenial tasks,\u201d including fetching cigars for the rapper.\n\nThe suit says Gables, 44, accompanied Rhymes on tour from early July to early September of last year, seven days a week, without being paid travel time or overtime, then worked for him from 2 p.m. to 8:30 a.m. daily without pay over his day rate from Sept. 3, 2024, until Jan. 10.\n\nOn that last day, the lawsuit alleges, Rhymes \u201cconstructively terminated\u201d Gables\u2019 employment \u201cby repeatedly punching him in the face\u201d after first raging at his assistant for not promptly bringing a \u201ccatering-size\u201d pan of chicken in from the rapper\u2019s car, then chewing Gables out for sending a text to his minor daughter during work hours.\n\nGables \u201ctolerated a great deal of abuse while working for Busta Rhymes, he could not tolerate the repeated physical assault and was unable to return to work,\u201d the complaint says, adding that Gables went to the hospital for treatment of bruising and swelling and filed a police report regarding the alleged assault. He did not return to work.\n\nAfter Gables filed the police report he was \u201cfrozen out of the hip-hop music industry,\u201d the complaint alleges. He is seeking back pay as well as compensatory and punitive damages and is asking for a jury trial.",

      "text": "Precinct DTLA, well-known gay bar, warns it could close after former employee claims discrimination\n- Share via\nA downtown Los Angeles bar known as a haven for the gay community is warning it could soon shutter as it faces a costly legal fight with a former employee.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a couple of slow weekends away from having to close our doors,\u201d owners of Precinct DTLA wrote Friday on Instagram.\n\u201cLike many small businesses, we\u2019ve taken hit after hit \u2014 from COVID shutdowns and ICE raids to citywide curfews and the ongoing decline of nightlife. But what we\u2019re facing now is even more devastating.\u201d\nYour morning catch up: Can L.A. save the \u2018original\u2019 French dip; old powerlines and fires; and more big stories.\nIn May, Jessica Gonzales sued the bar, its owner, manager and an employee, alleging she faced discrimination and harassment as a cisgender, heterosexual woman and was subjected to an unsafe work environment.\nGonzales, who worked at the bar on Broadway for eight years, claimed that when she reported employees and patrons were having sex in the bar, its owner told her to \u201cstop complaining.\u201d\nAccording to a complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Gonzales was required to work the coat check for Precinct DTLA\u2019s weekly \u201cjockstrap / underwear party\u201d without receiving pay. She said the bar\u2019s manager eliminated the coat check fee, believing it would \u201cincentivize more patrons to drop their pants.\u201d\nGonzales claimed the environment grew so hostile she needed to bring stress balls to work. One day, her complaint said, another employee grabbed her stress ball and refused to give it back to her. In a struggle over the stress ball, Gonzales claims the employee broke two of her fingers.\nAccording to her lawsuit, Gonzales was effectively fired after the incident, in part because Precinct DTLA\u2019s owner and manager wanted to replace her with a gay male employee.\n\u201cThese claims are completely false,\u201d the bar\u2019s representatives wrote on Instagram.\nIn the post, they added that the lawyer representing Gonzales \u201cappears to have a clear anti-LGBTQ agenda.\u201d\n\u201cThere are multiple reports \u2014 including from individuals who previously worked with him \u2014 that he used anti-LGBTQ slurs in written emails while at his former firm,\u201d they wrote on Instagram.\nOwners of the historic downtown nightclub, which has appeared in such films as \u201cThe Bodyguard\u201d and \u201cNight at the Roxbury,\u201d announced its final events will be in September.\nGonzales is represented by John Barber, court records show. The Times reported in 2023 that Barber and his colleague Jeff Ranen regularly denigrated Black, Jewish, Middle Eastern, Asian and gay people in emails they exchanged while partners at Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith.\nAfter Barber and Ranen left to start their own firm, Lewis Brisbois, released scores of the lawyers\u2019 emails, which showed the men regularly used anti-gay slurs, The Times reported.\nIn a joint statement at the time, Barber and Ranen said they were \u201cashamed\u201d and \u201cdeeply sorry.\u201d\nIn a written statement on Barber\u2019s behalf, his law partner, Nicole Davidson, said that to \u201cdebate or even acknowledge\u201d what she called false allegations raised in the Instagram post \u201cwould distract from what matters: that our client was wrongfully fired, retaliated against, and physically abused while employed by Precinct.\u201d\n\u201cWe will allow the judicial system to serve as the forum for resolution, not social media,\u201d she wrote in an email. Davidson added that appealing to bar patrons to contribute to a legal defense fund smacks of \u201ccrass opportunism.\u201d\nIn the Instagram post, Precinct DTLA\u2019s representatives said defending themselves from Gonzales\u2019 allegations was \u201cdraining us emotionally and financially.\u201d\n\u201cCome to the bar,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBuy a drink. Order some food. Tip the staff. Show up.\u201d"

The 54-year-old musician said he is \u201cfighting against these disgusting lies\u201d about his alleged behavior and promised, \u201cI will not break and I will NEVER back down.\u201d\nTerrance \u201cT.A.\u201d Dixon filed a federal lawsuit against his former employer last week, accusing Fat Joe of underpayment, swindling him out of pay for his contribution to album tracks, ditching him in foreign countries without money or transportation home and running a criminal organization built on intimidation and violence. The lawsuit also alleges that Fat Joe forced the hype man into approximately 4,000 sex acts with women in front of him and his team and accuses the rapper of having sexual relationships with girls who were 15 and 16.\nFat Joe\u2019s former hype man sues the rapper, alleging criminal organization built on intimidation and sex with minors. The rapper\u2019s lawyer calls it \u2018retaliation.\u2019\nFat Joe in his statement railed against people in his close circles who \u201ctake my love and kindness for weakness\u201d and claimed that \u201cpeople steal from me, grow jealous of me, lie on me.\u201d He said ultimately he and his family face the fallout of betrayal.\nThe \u201cAll the Way Up\u201d rapper did not name Dixon or explicitly relay the allegations against him but instead dwelled on how haters \u201cdecide to go after one of the things you value the most \u2014 your reputation,\u201d including by making up \u201cthe most insane stories\u201d as retaliation and taking their grievances to court. He said he won\u2019t be shaken down.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never let anyone on the streets extort me, so how would I ever let a crooked attorney and coward ex-hype man extort me?? I\u2019m from the Bronx!\u201d he said.\nFat Joe spoke out after his attorney Joe Tacopina dismissed Dixon\u2019s allegations as \u201ccomplete fabrications.\u201d In April, the rapper sued Dixon for alleged slander after the former hype man accused him on social media of flying a 16-year-old across state lines for sex \u2014 hence the suggestion of retaliation.\nSmokey Robinson\u2019s accusers blast his $500-million countersuit as \u2018attempt to silence and intimidate\u2019\nMotown legend Smokey Robinson this week filed a $500-million countersuit against his sexual assault accusers. Their legal team says \u2018it is a baseless and vindictive legal maneuver.\u2019\nDixon\u2019s attorney Tyrone Blackburn was also subject to Fat Joe\u2019s ire as the rapper promised \u201cwe will finish you in court.\u201d New York police arrested Blackburn on Wednesday; he was accused of hitting a process server with his car in New York City and booked on suspicion of assault, NBC News reported. Blackburn\u2019s lawyer told XXL the arrest seemed to be \u201csomewhat of a setup.\u201d\nFat Joe concluded his Instagram statement by asserting that the era of attorneys leveraging their \u201claw license as a badge to extort people and destroy families with no evidence is over!!\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one!! You\u2019ve messed with the wrong one this time!!\u201d\nTimes assistant editor Christie D\u2019Zurilla contributed to this report."

The music star lost 100 pounds in recent years.\n\u2018I didn\u2019t mean to touch his behind honestly,\u2019 a woman said after rapper Busta Rhymes threw his drink at her for invading his personal space.\nAfter the 2014 death of his father, the \u201cTouch It\u201d rapper said he \u201cdrowned\u201d himself in work and \u201ckept drinking, smoking, eating bad\u201d to deal with his grief.

      "text": "Kanye West\u2019s ex-assistant details alleged sexual assault, stalking as she ramps up legal fight\n- Share via\nYe, the vitriolic rapper formerly known as Kanye West, is facing a new round of controversy involving fresh allegations from an ex-assistant including sex trafficking, sexual harassment, stalking and sexual battery.\nYe\u2019s accuser, former Yeezy employee Lauren Pisciotta, has taken more legal action against the Grammy-winning \u201cAll of the Lights\u201d musician a year after she sued him for sexual harassment and breach of contract, among other counts, in June 2024. In an amended complaint filed Tuesday in Los Angeles, Pisciotta claims the rapper forced her to perform oral sex on him, sexually assaulted her numerous times during her Yeezy employment and engaged in sexual activity with employees at his Yeezy offices. Pisciotta also accuses the rapper of stalking her after she filed her initial lawsuit.\nLegal representatives for Ye and his Yeezy brands did not immediately respond to The Times\u2019 request for comment Thursday.\nFat Joe calls out what he says are \u2018disgusting lies\u2019 nearly a week after his former hype man sued him for alleged coercion, intimidation and sex with minors.\nPisciotta\u2019s 37-page complaint, reviewed by The Times, doubles down on claims from her June 2024 suit but also details sexual assaults that allegedly occurred at a San Francisco hotel shortly after Ye hired Pisciotta in 2021 to help with the creation of his album \u201cDonda.\u201d\n\u201cFor almost two years Ms. Pisciotta dedicated her life to Ye under the pretense that he would present her with pivotal opportunities in the music and fashion industries at an even larger scale than any of her previous work,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cDespite Ms. Pisciotta\u2019s unwavering dedication to her job, Ye continued to sexually harass her at every opportunity.\u201d\nPisciotta alleges that during her time working with Ye in San Francisco, he forcefully kissed her on the mouth, forcibly touched her genitals with one hand while stroking himself with the other, exposed himself and \u201cforced his penis into her mouth,\u201d according to legal documents.\nYe allegedly sexually assaulted Pisciotta another time, in October 2023, according to legal documents, when they were en route to Paris from Los Angeles. The 48-year-old rapper requested Pisciotta come to his private room on his plane and demanded she give him a hug. She refused, but Ye said he needed to speak with her and locked her in the room, where he allegedly \u201cretreated to his bed and began to masturbate.\u201d Pisciotta claims she was \u201cforced\u201d to remain in the room until someone opened the door from the outside.\nResources for survivors of sexual assault\nIf you or someone you know is the victim of sexual violence, you can find support using RAINN\u2019s National Sexual Assault Hotline. Call (800) 656-HOPE or visit online.rainn.org to speak with a trained support specialist.\nThe complaint also paints a disturbing picture of the inner workings and culture of the Yeezy offices, alleging Ye verbally abused Pisciotta, often used \u201cderogatory, antisemitic slurs\u201d and \u201cdemanded assistants and other employees draw swastikas in the workplace.\u201d Earlier this year, Ye came under fire for placing a TV ad during the Super Bowl for a website selling a T-shirt emblazoned with the hate symbol.\nAdditionally, \u201cYe openly performed sexual acts with women at the Yeezy office,\u201d the complaint said, adding that one of the women was his current wife, Bianca Censori. Pisciotta\u2019s complaint also repeated previous allegations that Ye constantly messaged her about his sexual fantasies involving her, sending sexually explicit videos, photos and memes.\nYe, who in recent years has used his social media pages to spew hate including antisemitic rants, posted on X earlier this year about his inappropriate workplace practices in numerous lewd posts mentioned in the complaint.\n\u201cLife is about using your position to f\u2014 the baddest b\u2014 possible,\u201d he said in one post.\nTyler Perry faces legal heat from an actor who appeared in \u2018The Oval.\u2019 An attorney for Perry says the claims are \u201cfabricated.\u201d\nOther since-deleted posts from Ye include \u201cI\u2019m a walking me too,\u201d referring to the watershed #MeToo movement, and \u201cI\u2019m a big time perv.\u201d The complaint also includes posts where Ye uses misogynistic language and homophobic slurs, and claims there is a difference between \u201cme too rapes\u201d and \u201creal rape.\u201d\nThough the complaint mainly concerns incidents that allegedly occurred during Pisciotta\u2019s Yeezy tenure, she said the rapper admitted to assaulting her in 2015 during a studio recording session in Santa Monica.\nPisciotta alleged that West\u2019s disturbing behavior did not end after she was terminated at Yeezy. She claims the rapper grabbed her by the throat and stuck his tongue in her ear when they saw each other at a concert in November 2022.

She\u2019s being sued for it\n- Share via\nCardi B\u2019s infamous microphone-throw incident is being raised again, almost two years after it took place in Las Vegas.\nAn Ohio woman is suing the 32-year-old \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d rapper, claiming battery, assault and negligence. The owners of Drai\u2019s Beachclub and Nightclub, where the incident took place on July 29, 2023, are also being sued for negligence. The suit was filed days before the statute of limitations in Nevada for such charges ran out.\nCardi B threw a microphone at a concertgoer who pelted her with their drink at a Las Vegas concert. A video of the incident has gone viral on social media.\nAccording to court documents filed in Clark County on Monday, the plaintiff \u2014 who chose to go by Jane Doe because of \u201cpsychiatric trauma\u201d \u2014 alleges that during Cardi B\u2019s performance, she encouraged the audience to \u201csplash water on her\u201d amid \u201cvisibly high-temperature conditions.\u201d Though she initially approved, allegedly pouring water on herself and stating \u201cWooh that s\u2014 feel good,\u201d it was when the plaintiff partook that the rapper abruptly and \u201cforcefully\u201d threw her microphone.\nThe object is said to have hit Jane Doe, with Cardi B shouting \u201cI said splash my p\u2014, not my face, b\u2014.\u201d Documents called it an \u201cunreasonable escalation\u201d that resulted in \u201charmful and offensive contact.\u201d Though the deed was investigated by police at the time, the rapper was not charged. Representatives for Cardi B did not immediately respond on Thursday to The Times\u2019 request for comment.\nThe microphone Cardi B threw at a Las Vegas concertgoer nabbed $99,900 on Ebay after a weeklong auction.\nJust weeks later the microphone was auctioned on eBay and fetched $99,000. It is a key part of the case, as Jane Doe claims the sale \u201cexacerbated emotional distress.\u201d At the time, sellers told TMZ that the money would be given to two charities \u2014 the Wounded Warrior Project and Friendship Circle Las Vegas, a local program that helps individuals with special needs.\nThe plaintiff is seeking damages up to $15,000 for alleged physical and emotional injuries, as well as reputational harm."

Gables accuses Rhymes of verbal abuse and physical assault, stating he was subjected to long hours without proper pay and was ultimately 'constructively terminated' after an alleged violent incident. Rhymes plans to countersue, asserting that the claims are fabricated and part of a shake-down.",
