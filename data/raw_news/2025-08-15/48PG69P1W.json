      "text": "What to expect from Friday\u2019s Trump-Putin summit on US soil: Will a peace deal actually be reached?\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s Friday meeting with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin may be the most-watched Washington-Moscow summit in decades \u2014 but don\u2019t expect any major decisions to be made as the US president seeks a \u201cmore firm understanding\u201d of how to end Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine, sources and experts tell The Post.\nTrump, 79, plans to treat the meeting as a \u201clistening exercise\u201d rather than a high-stakes negotiation, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.\nWhile Putin, 72, has set audacious conditions for agreeing to a cease-fire with Ukraine, the US has made no concrete decision to date on whether to support them, sources familiar with the matter tell The Post.\nWhat Russia wants\nAmong the demands reportedly pushed by Putin \u2014 almost entirely unchanged from the start of the war nearly three-and-a-half years ago \u2014 is the formal recognition by the US and Ukraine of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts as Russian territory, despite Moscow being unable to secure them in 11 years of trying.\nThis recognition would include the roughly 30% of Donetsk and Luhansk that Russia does not control.\nThe Kremlin also seeks a freezing of the current front lines.\nThe desires were communicated to Trump by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin at the Kremlin last week, according to European officials.\nHere are the latest details on Trump and Putin's meeting in Alaska\n- The meeting will take place in Anchorage, Alaska at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.\n- Trump said his sitdown with Putin in Alaska will be \u201csetting the table\u201d for a possible future meeting about the war in Ukraine with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky present.\n- Putin suggested the US and Russia could reach a deal on nuclear arms control.\n- President Trump estimated Thursday there is a 25% chance that his Alaska summit will fail.\n- Zelensky met with European world leaders ahead of the meeting between Trump and Putin.\nHowever, Russia has not made these demands public, which is one reason why Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would like a sitdown with Putin \u2014 to get the terms direct from the horse\u2019s mouth.\nRussia has also pushed for Ukraine to formally agree to never join NATO, a halt to shipments of Western weapons to Ukraine and a prohibition on NATO-aligned soldiers from setting foot on Ukrainian territory.\nDespite the White House insisting the war will be the primary topic, Russian officials have indicated they see the Alaska summit as a prime opportunity to discuss potential deals with the US \u2014 including opening up Alaskan airspace to Russian flights.\n\u201cWe hope that the upcoming summit will give impetus to the normalization of bilateral relations,\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told state media site Izvestia, noting that restoration of air traffic could be a possible topic.\nThe Arctic and economic cooperation are also topics that interest Russia, Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov said, noting that the Kremlin hopes the meeting will lead to Trump going to Russia in the future.\nHere\u2019s the latest on Trump and Putin\u2019s summit in Alaska\n- What to expect from Friday\u2019s Trump-Putin summit on US soil: Will a peace deal actually be reached?\n- White House releases new details on Trump-Putin summit in US, calls it a \u2018listening exercise\u2019\n- Ukraine, European leaders counter Russian cease-fire plan ahead of Trump and Putin meeting\n- Trump rails against \u2018unfair\u2019 media quoting \u2018fired losers\u2019 ahead of high-stakes meeting with Putin\nHowever, Russia observers have expressed concerns over the Alaska location \u2014 particularly as Moscow\u2019s hardliners have long \u201clamented the loss of Russia\u2019s larger territorial extent throughout history,\u201d George Barros of the Institute for the Study of War said Tuesday.\n\u201cRussian nationalists have manufactured a pseudo-historical argument for why America\u2019s purchase of Alaska [in 1867] was illegitimate, and that Alaska is therefore actually legally Russian,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all nonsense, of course.\u201d\n\u201cThe Russian nationalist doesn\u2019t respect the United States, but rather invents territorial disputes with its neighbors and seethes at Russa\u2019s diminished geography.\u201d\nWhat Ukraine wants\nZelensky, 47, has called Moscow\u2019s demands untenable for establishing a cease-fire, but has signaled openness to some concessions \u2014 so long as they are made as part of a final peace deal.\nEnding the war after more than three grueling years would be a positive for Zelensky, as his country has been ravaged by missile strikes, mines and Russian infantry.\nBut the Ukrainian leader has been clear he will not accept peace at any price.\nZelensky has been adamant that Ukraine receive security guarantees, like NATO membership or nuclear weapons, to ensure Russia doesn\u2019t invade again in the future.\n\u201cIt is impossible to talk about Ukraine without Ukraine, and no one will recognize that. That\u2019s why this conversation may be important for their bilateral track, but they cannot decide anything on Ukraine without us,\u201d Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv Tuesday. \u201cI hope the US president understands that and takes into account.\u201d\nWhat Trump wants\nFriday will give the president a chance to observe Putin with his own eyes to better assess whether the Russian dictator is \u201ctapping [him] along\u201d with empty promises of peace, as Trump himself has occasionally suggested might be the case.\n\u201dOnly one party that\u2019s involved in this war is going to be present, and so this is for the president to go in and to get, again, a more firm and better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end,\u201d Leavitt said.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio similarly described the summit as a \u201cfeel-out meeting, to be honest.\u201d\n\u201dThe president talked to Putin on the phone three or four times, OK? And nothing has come of it \u2014 or at least we haven\u2019t gotten to where we want to be,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the president feels like, \u2018Look, I\u2019ve got to look at this guy across the table. I need to see him face-to-face. I need to hear him one-on-one. I need to make an assessment by looking at him.\u2019\u201d\nTrump made ending the war in Ukraine one of his major 2024 campaign promises, and securing a peace deal would provide a major bulwark for his foreign policy legacy.\nTo that end, Trump is expected to raise the issue of land swaps between Russia and Ukraine to gauge Putin\u2019s reaction. The US president will also speak to European leaders ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting in addition to after the sitdown, sources familiar with the preparations say.\n\u201cThe next meeting will be with Zelensky and Putin, or Zelensky and Putin and me. I\u2019ll be there if they need, but I want a meeting set up between the two leaders,\u201d Trump said Monday. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some land swapping.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump rails against \u2018unfair\u2019 media quoting \u2018fired losers\u2019 ahead of high-stakes meeting with Putin\nPresident Trump raged against the \u201cunfair\u201d media over their coverage of his high-stakes summit with Russian tyrant Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.\n\u201cVery unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin. Constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton, who just said that, even though the meeting is on American soil,\u201d Trump seethed on Truth Social Wednesday.\n\u201c\u2018Putin has already won.\u2019 What\u2019s that all about? We are winning on EVERYTHING. The Fake News is working overtime (No tax on overtime!). If I got Moscow and Leningrad free, as part of the deal with Russia, the Fake News would say that I made a bad deal! But now they\u2019ve been caught,\u201d he added.\nLeningrad reverted to its pre-Bolshevik name, St. Petersburg, in 1991.\nTrump\u2019s anticipated meeting at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson with Putin will mark the first time the Russian leader sets foot on US soil in about a decade. It will also be Putin\u2019s first in-person meeting with a US president since he began the brutal invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has made ending the bloody war in Ukraine one of his top foreign policy objectives. Over recent months, he has soured on Putin over the brutal Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukrainian civilians.\nCritics such as Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton have argued that the president will be welcoming a \u201crogue leader of a pariah state\u201d into the US and that Putin will attempt to \u201ctake advantage\u201d of him.\nThe Friday summit meeting comes after special envoy Steve Witkoff met with the Russian leader at the Kremlin last week, ahead of Trump\u2019s deadline for Moscow to move toward peace or else the US would work to cut off its oil exports using steep economic penalties.\nHere\u2019s the latest on Trump and Putin\u2019s summit in Alaska\n- What to expect from Friday\u2019s Trump-Putin summit on US soil: Will a peace deal actually be reached?\n- White House releases new details on Trump-Putin summit in US, calls it a \u2018listening exercise\u2019\n- Ukraine, European leaders counter Russian cease-fire plan ahead of Trump and Putin meeting\n- Trump rails against \u2018unfair\u2019 media quoting \u2018fired losers\u2019 ahead of high-stakes meeting with Putin\nDetails about Putin\u2019s exact conditions for bringing about an end to his country\u2019s war are murky and have drawn confusion from European allies.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has publicly cast doubt on making significant territorial concessions to Russia and underscored that Ukraine must have a say in any potential deal.\nThe Trump administration is working toward a trilateral summit among Trump, Putin and Zelensky and sees the Alaska meeting as a step toward that goal, according to Vice President JD Vance.\nOne of Trump\u2019s close allies, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, has claimed the president is \u201ctesting\u201d Putin and trying to gauge his openness to peace.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio similarly implied that Trump is attempting to get a better sense of whether the Russian dictator is open to peace.\n\u201cThe president talked to Putin on the phone three times or four times. Okay. And nothing has come of it \u2014 or at least we haven\u2019t gotten to where we want to be,\u201d Rubio told \u201cSid and Friends in the Morning\u201d on Tuesday.\n\u201cSo the president feels like, \u2018Look, I\u2019ve got to look at this guy across the table.

  "argos_summary": "President Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, for a three\u2011hour discussion that he described as a \u201clistening exercise\u201d and claimed made \u201cgreat progress\u201d toward ending Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, though no concrete terms were disclosed.

The summit was seen by U.S. officials as a chance to gauge Putin\u2019s willingness to negotiate, with no immediate outcomes expected and the meeting positioned as a precursor to a possible trilateral summit involving Zelensky.  Media coverage highlighted the lack of detail, the political stakes for Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, and the broader international debate over the feasibility of a cease\u2011fire under Moscow\u2019s conditions.",
