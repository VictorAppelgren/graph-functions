  "content": "Quadruple killer Bryan Kohberger\u2019s phone records reveal creepy details about his loner lifestyle \u2014 with him obsessively texting and calling \u201cMother\u201d and \u201cFather\u201d in a \u201csuper eerie\u201d way being likened to Norman Bates in \u201cPsycho.\u201d\n\nThe 30-year-old former criminology student used his devices to look up sick porn \u2014 searching \u201craped,\u201d \u201cforced,\u201d \u201cpassed out,\u201d \u201cvoyeur\u201d and \u201csleeping\u201d \u2014 and take creepy selfies that he had no one to send to, according to digital forensic experts Jared and Heather Barnhart, who had been slated to testify at his trial before his surprise plea deal admitting the Idaho slayings.\n\nHe would then call his parents all the time, even to fall asleep \u2014 while hardly having any friends, the experts revealed Thursday on NewsNation\u2019s \u201cBanfield.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo think about all the people you meet and the hundreds of random numbers,\u201d she said \u2014 while noting that even the 18 he had were impersonal entries, like \u201c\u2018girl I ran with,\u2019 \u2018second girl I ran with,\u2019 a contact, and in parentheses \u2018hair.'\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then there was \u2018Mother\u2019 and \u2018Father\u2019 and his sister and just a few others. Eighteen,\u201d the expert said.\n\nThe killer would even stiltedly call his parents \u201cMother\u201d and \u201cFather\u201d in text messages \u2014 which reminded the forensics experts of a big-screen \u201cPsycho.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Bates Motel,\u201d Jared Barnhart said, referring to the setting of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s 1960 film that then became the title of an A&E prequel in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt is this feeling of that movie and \u2018Mother,\u2019 and it\u2019s just super eerie,\u201d he said.\n\nThe killer \u2014 who is serving four life sentences behind bars \u2014 was so attached to his parents that it seemed like he needed to speak with them just to fall asleep at night, Heather Barnhart explained.\n\n\u201cIf one [parent] didn\u2019t respond, he would reach out to the other,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would constantly text them and call them, starting as early as five or six in the morning \u2026 And then also at night, to almost talk him into going to sleep and being able to rest.\u201d\n\nThe forensic pair also said that Kohberger would take selfies, sometimes shirtless and flexing his muscles, but wouldn\u2019t send them to anyone, including the infamous selfie he took of giving a thumbs up just hours after he carried out the gruesome murders.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have friends to send this to,\u201d Healther Barnhart said of the selfie, featuring Kohberger\u2019s distinctively bushy eyebrows, a trait one surviving victim used to describe him.\n\n\u201cYeah, it was normal for him to take selfies and do nothing with them. They weren\u2019t sent to a person,\u201d Jared Barnhart said.\n\nKohberger also searched disturbing terms on the internet, including \u201craped,\u201d \u201cforced,\u201d \u201cpassed out,\u201d \u201cvoyeur\u201d and \u201csleeping,\u201d the Barnharts said.\n\n\u201cThe easiest way to say it is that all of his terms were consistently around nonconsensual sex acts,\u201d Jared Barnhart said.\n\nKohberger tried to wipe his search history, but he didn\u2019t do a thorough enough job to conceal his sick curiosities, the pair said.\n\nThe Barnharts \u2014 who run a forensics company called Cellebrite \u2014 had been prepared to testify at Kohberger\u2019s highly anticipated trial, which was originally scheduled to begin this month.\n\nKohberger, however, copped a plea deal weeks before the trial, which allowed him to avoid facing the death penalty and which his victims\u2019 families say deprived them of answers.\n\nKohberger admitted to slaying Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle on Nov. 13, 2022 in their off-campus house in Moscow.\n\nAfter his sentencing, Kohberger was transferred from jail to a prison where his fellow inmates have been psychologically tormenting him by yelling into the vents that lead to his cell at all hours of the day.",

      "text": "Bryan Kohberger fancied himself a criminal mastermind \u2014 so why\u2019d he make so many dumb mistakes?\nWell, that\u2019s one way to fail criminology school.\nBryan Kohberger had been in a criminology PhD program at Washington State University when he drove to nearby Moscow, Idaho, and slaughtered four University of Idaho undergrads in 2022.\nBut for that crime, this student gets an \u201cF.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t try to cover his tracks: Kohberger clearly had a firm grasp of common investigative techniques and took pains to subvert them \u2014 including scrubbing his car meticulously clean after the killings.\nBut his attempts were so half-baked that they only made him seem more suspicious, according to prosecutors.\nExperts say he attempted to leave no traces, and was more careful than many killers \u2014 but he made some obvious mistakes.\n\u201cHe was certainly smarter than most murderers,\u201d former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told The Post. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t the perfect crime.\u201d\nRahmani noted that it took weeks for authorities to find the suspect, which is \u201catypical now with advances in technology.\u201d\nThese are some of Kohberger\u2019s biggest blunders.\nLeaving his DNA behind\nThe murder weapon was never found, but a knife sheath smudged with male DNA left at the scene became the prosecution\u2019s best piece of physical evidence.\nRahmani said the blunder revealed that the killings were harder than Kohberger expected \u2014 betraying that it\u2019s \u201ca chaotic scene when you\u2019re stabbing multiple people and you\u2019re just by yourself.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d he added.\nAnother former prosecutor and Court TV anchor, Vinnie Politan, said Kohberger likely \u201cran into an unexpected situation\u201d when one of the victims, Madison Mogen, wasn\u2019t alone. She and best friend Kaylee Goncalves were sleeping together in the same bed.\nThey were the first victims.\nAnd the dropped sheath likely revealed that they did not die without a struggle.\n\u201cThe women fought back, and in the struggle,\u201d the knife sheath fell out, Politan speculated.\n\u201cThen when he was leaving, he ran into Xana [Kernodle], then Ethan [Chapin], two more unexpected victims,\u201d Politan explained. \u201cHe was exhausted and didn\u2019t have time to think, so he left without any realizing he didn\u2019t have the sheath.\u201d\nBuying the murder weapon on Amazon\nProsecutors said Kohberger purchased a Ka-Bar military-style knife, a strap sheath, and a sharpener on Amazon while living at his parents\u2019 house in Pennsylvania months before the murders.\nHe seemed to know his online purchases might be traced: He used a gift card, which can be anonymous, to make the payments and even tried to delete his purchase history.\nBut why make the purchase online at all when anyone can buy a knife with cash at any Walmart or truck stop?\nDefense attorney David Seltzer said, \u201cClearly Kohberger left breadcrumbs linking him to the crimes, and we will never know why, or if they were heat-of-the-moment mistakes.\u201d\nSeltzer said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if mental health played a role in Kohberger\u2019s crimes.\nDriving his own car to the crime scene, then cleaning it too well\nKohberger\u2019s white Hyundai Elantra is what first landed him on detectives\u2019 radar.\nSecurity camera footage showed the car circling the victims\u2019 block, parking behind their house, then speeding away after the crime.\nA search of white Elantra drivers included Kohberger, who had been pulled over near the University of Idaho campus months before the killings.\nHe did thoroughly clean the interior of the car afterward, prosecutors said \u2014 but that only made him seem more suspicious, Latah County Prosecuting Attorney Bill Thompson revealed Wednesday.\n\u201cI think we can all look to our own cars. Those compartments in the doors where you try to keep them clean where you put stuff? There\u2019s always some degree of crud in there \u2014 they were spotless,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cDefendant\u2019s car had been meticulously cleaned inside.\u201d\nThompson noted that Kohberger had previously written a paper on crime scene evidence collection \u2014 making his deep clean even more suspicious.\nHis phone also tracked him driving to Moscow, Idaho \u2014 the town where the killings happened \u2014 at least 23 times before the murders.\nHe kept his own phone\nAnyone who\u2019s watched \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d knows to use a prepaid, burner cellphone when they\u2019re up to no good.\nBut Kohberger kept a traceable cellphone.\nHe was careful to deactivate the device before driving to Moscow on the night of the murders, but it was only off between around 2:30 a.m. and 4:45 a.m. \u2014 the exact window of the killings.\nHe also reactivated the phone in another town 25 miles away from his apartment.\nRahmani said Kohberger should have just left his phone at home.\n\u201cHe was careful,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not a genius.\u201d\nTaking out the trash\nKohberger knew his DNA could tie him to the crime scene: He wore latex gloves to the supermarket and hid trash that contained his hair or saliva.\nAt one point during the four days he was surveilled at his parents\u2019 Pennsylvania home by the FBI prior to his arrest, Kohberger was observed putting trash from his family\u2019s house into neighbors\u2019 garbage bins around 4 a.m.\nKohberger clearly knew investigators search suspects\u2019 garbage, but it apparently didn\u2019t occur to him that agents might be watching the house \u2014 or that they\u2019d notice him dumping garbage in the wee hours."

      "text": "Bryan Kohberger set to die in one of America\u2019s worst prisons \u2014 with feces-smeared cages, riots and \u2018biohazard\u2019 ventilation system\nBryan Kohberger is set to spend the rest of his life in one of America\u2019s worst prisons \u2014 a maximum-security hellhole that faces accusations of feces-smeared cages, brutally violent guards, rioting inmates and a \u201cbiohazard\u201d ventilation system.\nThe 30-year-old convicted killer of four University of Idaho students will serve his sentence in the state\u2019s most brutal prison alongside Chad Daybell, the child-murderer and husband of \u201cDoomsday\u201d cult mom Lori Vallow, as well as two of Idaho\u2019s most notorious serial killers.\nIdaho Maximum Security Institution (IMSI), where Kohberger is expected to be sentenced to life in prison, opened in 1989 and hosts the Gem State\u2019s \u201cmost disruptive male residents\u201d and violent criminals.\nSince then, it has developed a reputation as not just the toughest prison in the state \u2014 but one of the harshest in the nation.\nIMSI was named one of the \u201c15 Worst Prisons in America\u201d by Security Journal Americas in 2024 \u2014 alongside other infamous institutions including Louisiana State Penitentiary, aka \u201cThe Farm,\u201d San Quentin in California and Attica Correctional Facility in western New York.\nThe magazine highlighted its alleged harsh treatment of inmates, excessive use of solitary confinement, and lack of mental health resources.\nViolence between inmates and allegations of excessive force by corrections officers were also brought up, as well as overcrowding leading to \u201ca tense and volatile environment,\u201d the outlet wrote.\nIn 2016, the newly appointed director of the Idaho Department of Correction looked to reform the state\u2019s use of solitary as punishment.\nMany of the inmates were locked away in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, KBOI reported at the time.\nThis meant little to no human interaction, food in cells, and only showering three times a week, a pattern some inmates live under for decades.\n\u201cNinety-seven percent of these guys are going to get out and walk into an Idaho community,\u201d Kempf told KBOI. \u201cIf we treat them like crap, if we treat them like animals, they\u2019re going to walk out of a prison like that.\u201d\nIn particular, he highlighted the dangers of excessive solitary confinement for inmates.\n\u201cYou do that for 10 or 15 years, you\u2019ve created a monster out of that person,\u201d he said.\nKohberger, 30, who on Tuesday pleaded guilty to killing four University of Idaho students in their Moscow home while they slept in November 2022, has been held in maximum security at Ada County Jail in Boise since the trial was moved to the state capital.\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post\u2019s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here!\nBut he is expected to be transferred to Idaho Maximum Security Institution, some 10 miles south, following his sentencing hearing on July 23.\nThe remote prison is surrounded by a double perimeter fence along with razor wire, an electronic detection system, and 24-hour armed patrol.\nLast year, 90 inmates at the IMSI went on a hunger strike demanding better treatment and services.\nThey complained of feces-covered recreation \u201ccages,\u201d long bouts of isolation, serious medical care delays, and a dirty HVAC system that they compared to a \u201cbiohazard,\u201d the Idaho Statesman reported at the time.\nThe prison was forced to confirm that it halted many services, including access to certain religious practices, in 2020 in response to unprecedented staff shortages brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo quell the riot, prison authorities used pepper spray and tear gas on the inmates, the Idaho Department of Corrections (IDOC) confirmed.\nHere\u2019s the latest coverage on Bryan Kohberger:\n- Bryan Kohberger admits to slaughtering 4 Idaho college students as they slept\n- Why Bryan Kohberger\u2019s guilty plea means he may get the last laugh \u2014 and torment his victims further\n- Prosecutors offered Bryan Kohberger a plea deal despite a mountain of damning evidence \u2014 here\u2019s what they had\n- Deluded Bryan Kohberger fans known as \u2018probergers\u2019 insist he\u2019s innocent \u2013 despite guilty plea deal: \u2018Reeks of a coverup\u2019\n- Families of slaughtered Idaho students vow to fight Bryan Kohberger plea deal: \u2018Idaho has failed\u2019\nThe IDOC claimed the protest\u2019s ringleaders wanted to force staff to \u201csegregate\u201d housing by gang and racial affiliation, the Idaho Statesman reported.\nThe IDOC didn\u2019t respond immediately to requests for comment.\nThe prison, built to replace the original Idaho Penitentiary \u2014 which was built even before Idaho became a state in 1890 \u2014 can house a maximum of 549 inmates, including a dedicated section for mentally ill offenders.\nIt offers restrictive housing beds and disciplinary detention.\nIt also includes Idaho\u2019s death row, where all eight of the state\u2019s male inmates facing death sentences are held.\nKohberger\u2019s deal, which also spared him a trial and the chance of death by firing squad, means he must spend the rest of his life in prison with no opportunity for parole or appeals, after the PhD criminology student admitted murdering Ethan Chapin, 20, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Madison Mogen, 21.\nOther famous inmates at the prison include Daybell, currently on death row for murdering his first wife, Tammy, as well as second wife Lori Vallow\u2019s two children, Tylee Ryan, 16, and JJ Vallow, 7.\nSerial killer Gerald Pizzuto is awaiting execution for four 1985 murders in Idaho and Washington.\nAnother resident is serial killer Thomas Eugene Creech, who is believed to have murdered as many as 43 people between 1974 and 1981.\nHe was convicted of five killings."

Did he ever think that he wanted to kill me or my friends? Were we spared because we were friends with him?\u201d Arntz told the Idaho Statesman.\nArntz said she and her younger brother, Thomas, were floored when Kohberger was initially accused of the gruesome November 13, 2022 stabbings and those feelings of shock rushed back this week with her former friend\u2019s admissions.\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted that he could actually do something so heinous,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand why the families are so upset, they were starved for justice, and I would 100% be, too.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, there was never any guarantee that he\u2019d be given the death penalty. So I think him taking the plea deal was better for everyone,\u201d Arntz told the outlet. \u201cHe\u2019s locked up for life. Let the inside deal with him.\u201d\nArntz\u2019 brother Thomas said he was \u201crelieved\u201d by the guilty plea and said he was sorry for Kohberger\u2019s family.\n\u201cI am deeply sorry that Bryan\u2019s parents have to live with this as well,\u201d Thomas told the outlet. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought they were kind people, and they didn\u2019t deserve this. And for Bryan, God have mercy on his soul.\u201d\nSimilarly, the guidance counselor at Kohberger\u2019s high school also said she felt for his family and the families of the victims.\n\u201cI hope that his family will survive this horrendous ordeal and be able to get on with their lives,\u201d counselor Donna Yozwiak said. \u201cI also hope that the victims\u2019 relatives gain much needed closure and heal after this tragedy.\u201d\nAnother former friend of Kohberger\u2019s, Jack Baylis, 31, said the guilty plea removed any doubt of Kohberger\u2019s guilt because if he was innocent he would \u201cbe fighting tooth and nail\u201d for his innocence, Baylis told the Statesman.\nBaylis also said he believes that Kohberger committed the horrific killings to help him learn what it would be like to be a killer for his studies as a criminology PhD.\n\u201cI think he did it to see what it felt like, to experience it,\u201d Baylis said. \u201cIf he wanted to write a paper about what killers feel and why they kill, to be accurate, you have to experience it yourself to truly understand it.\u201d\n\u201cTo get into the mind of a killer, you have to be a killer, would be my guess.\u201d\nKohberger had been attending school at Washington State University when he drove to nearby Moscow, Idaho, to slaughter the four undergrads at their off-campus house while they were sleeping.\nKohberger had maintained his innocence and had been slated to go on trial in August and potentially faced death by firing squad if he\u2019d been found guilty.\nThe plea deal allowed him to skirt capital punishment and instead receive life imprisonment without parole.\nSome of the victims\u2019 families were outraged by the deal that left them with unanswered questions that could have been answered at trial and deprived them of potentially seeing Kohberger executed.\nGoncalves\u2019 father, Steve Goncalves, told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d Show that prosecutors \u201cfailed my whole family.\u201d"

He did not want a digital forensic trail available at all,\u201d she told the Mail.\nThe Cellebrite team also discovered a PDF file about another serial killer and rapist, Danny Rolling \u2014 also known as the \u201cGainesville Ripper\u201d \u2014 whose horrific murders targeting University of Florida students decades ago is eerily similar to Kohberger\u2019s heinous crimes.\nHere\u2019s the latest coverage on Bryan Kohberger:\n- Newly released crime scene photos show inside Idaho house where Bryan Kohberger killed four college students\n- Cops investigated Kohberger for eerily similar break-in a year before University of Idaho killings\n- Secret documents in Bryan Kohberger case, including pics of Idaho murder victims, could be made public\n- Newly released photo shows Bryan Kohberger just moments after arrest for Idaho murders\n- Bryan Kohberger may have used second weapon and left \u2018scared\u2019 while sparing surviving roommate: report\nRolling, who was the inspiration for the slasher classic \u201cScream,\u201d murdered five UF students \u2014 four women and one man \u2014 after breaking into their homes during a four-day spree in 1990.\nHe raped all his female victims, and killed two of them with a Ka-Bar knife \u2014 the same weapon Kohberger used, prosecutors said. Rolling was executed in 2006.\nKohberger\u2019s cell phone additionally contained creepy selfies of the killer posing shirtless and flexing his muscles, the experts said.\nHe also snapped the chilling selfie of himself giving the thumbs-up just hours after he murdered the four University of Idaho students.\nHeather, Senior Director of Forensic Research at Cellebrite, and Jared Barnhart, Head of CX Strategy and Advocacy at the company, were prepared to testify as expert witnesses at Kohberger\u2019s trial before he pleaded guilty last month.\nKohberger was sentenced to four life sentences for killing roommates Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin."

      "text": "Inmates planned to make Idaho killer Bryan Kohberger\u2019s life hell in prison: \u2018They were waiting for him\u2019\nThe inmates making quadruple murderer Bryan Kohberger\u2019s time in prison a living hell knew he was coming to the high-security Idaho lockup and planned how they could carry out a campaign of harassment against him, according to a report.\nKohberger was transferred from jail to the only high-security prison in the state after he received four life sentences last month for the gruesome slayings of four University of Idaho students in 2022.\nAnd the prisoners at Idaho Maximum Security Institution in Kuna \u201cwere aware he was coming,\u201d former homicide detective Chris McDonough told NewsNation Tuesday.\n\u201cThe inmates were apparently waiting for him,\u201d said McDonough, who now works for the Cold Case Foundation. \u201cAnd when he got there, they are now making his life absolutely miserable.\u201d\n\u201cThey got together and said, \u2018OK, well, you know, how do we harass this guy?'\u201d the former cop said. \u201cAnd apparently, they set this up long before he got there \u2026 the guards were unaware of it until it started happening.\u201d\nKohberger is being held in solitary confinement in a restrictive unit called J block that only has 32 other prisoners, who are \u201cthe worst of the worst outside of death row,\u201d McDonough said.\nThe unwelcoming neighbors decided to carry out a relentless taunting campaign against Kohberger by taking turns yelling through the vents into his cell around the clock.\n\u201cThey\u2019re utilizing the vent system. They\u2019re kicking the doors. They\u2019re taunting him,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re basically, you know, torturing him through, you know, using psychology. And my goodness, he\u2019s complaining.\u201d\nThe 30-year-old former criminology PhD student has been whining to the guards that he\u2019s been unable to sleep at night because of the crusade against him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s extremely annoyed and frustrated,\u201d McDonough told the Daily Mail.\nMcDonough said Kohberger will likely eventually be placed in the general prison population. But in the meantime, he\u2019ll have to put up with the hazing.\n\u201cThe inmates have come up with a creative idea in harassing him to the point where it\u2019s basically driving him crazy,\u201d McDonough said.\nThe ex-detective said since Kohberger isn\u2019t at risk of being physically harmed by the prisoners, guards likely won\u2019t do much to curb the harassment.\nHere\u2019s the latest coverage on Bryan Kohberger:\n- Newly released crime scene photos show inside Idaho house where Bryan Kohberger killed four college students\n- Cops investigated Kohberger for eerily similar break-in a year before University of Idaho killings\n- Secret documents in Bryan Kohberger case, including pics of Idaho murder victims, could be made public\n- Newly released photo shows Bryan Kohberger just moments after arrest for Idaho murders\n- Bryan Kohberger may have used second weapon and left \u2018scared\u2019 while sparing surviving roommate: report\n\u201cThe most they can do is write it down and, or, you know, tell him, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s nothing we can do. You\u2019re not in physical harm,'\u201d McDonough said of the guards.\nIn solitary, Kohberger is kept in his cell for 23 hours a day and only allowed out of it for one hour a day for outdoor recreation while he\u2019s in restraints. And Kohberger \u2014 whose lawyers have previously said he suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder \u2014 can only take a shower once every other day.\nWhen he goes outside, his entire unit \u2014 or \u201cpod\u201d \u2014 \u201cwill light up with heckling, with taunting. I mean, they\u2019ll start kicking the doors,\u201d McDonough said.\nKohberger last month unexpectedly copped to the Nov. 13, 2022, murders of Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen and Ethan Chapin at their off-campus house in Moscow.\nThe controversial deal he struck with prosecutors allowed him to avoid the death penalty and dodge a trial where victims\u2019 loved ones might have gotten a look into the motivation for the heinous stabbings \u2014 the lack of which drew ire from some victims\u2019 families."

      "text": "Idaho prison says inmates aren\u2019t harassing Bryan Kohberger, they\u2019re just trying to \u2018communicate\u2019 with him\nThe Idaho lockup housing Bryan Kohberger is downplaying claims that fellow inmates have been tormenting and taunting the convicted killer by yelling through vents \u2014 saying that\u2019s just how prisoners communicate.\nKohberger, who was hit with four life sentences last month in the slayings of four University of Idaho students, was transferred from jail to the only maximum-security prison in the state and is now being held there in solitary confinement.\n\u201cWe are aware of Kohberger\u2019s complaints about what he considers taunting,\u201d the Idaho Department of Corrections said in a statement to The Post.\n\u201cIncarcerated individuals commonly communicate with each other in prison. Bryan Kohberger is housed alone in a cell, and IDOC security staff maintain a safe and orderly environment for all individuals in our custody,\u201d the statement said.\nPrisoners at Kohberger\u2019s new digs at Idaho Maximum Security Institution in Kuna have had it out for the former criminology student \u2014 taking turns shouting into the vent that leads into his cell most hours of the day, a law enforcement source previously told the Daily Mail.\nKohberger, 30, has made multiple complaints to prison guards that he\u2019s been unable to sleep, according to Chris McDonough, a retired homicide detective who works for the Cold Case Foundation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s driving him crazy,\u201d McDonough told the outlet. \u201cThe inmates are tormenting him at night and almost all hours of the day \u2014 taunting him through the vents in his cell.\u201d\n\u201cThey are literally getting up into the grate and yelling at him. The inmates are taking turns doing it. It\u2019s relentless,\u201d McDonough continued. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely annoyed and frustrated. He\u2019s complaining to the authorities that he can\u2019t sleep because of them.\u201d\nKohberger is being housed in the prison\u2019s restricted unit in the facility\u2019s J block, away from the general prison population.\nHe\u2019s kept in a cell by himself at all times, except for one hour a day when he\u2019s let into \u201cthe cage\u201d outside for recreation, while he wears restraints. And he\u2019s only allotted one shower every other day.\nThe high-profile nature of Kohberger\u2019s case and the fact that he copped to such abhorrent crimes make him a target for other inmates who would want to harm him \u201cjust to make a name for themselves,\u201d McDonough explained.\nAnd since the other inmates don\u2019t pose a physical threat to Kohberger while he\u2019s in solitary, prison staff aren\u2019t likely to intervene, the former cop claimed.\nStill, as attention moves away from Kohberger over time, prison staff may eventually be willing to move him back to the general population, McDonough explained.\nAt the jail in which Kohberger was previously kept pending trial, other defendants said he did unusual things like spending hours on the phone with his mom, MaryAnn, washing his hands compulsively, taking hour-long showers and staying awake at night, only to nap during the day.\nLast month, Kohberger took a surprise plea deal just weeks before his highly anticipated trial was set to kick off. The deal saw him skirt the possibility of the death penalty, enraging some of the families of his victims and leaving loved ones with no explanation for why he committed the heinous murders.\nHe admitted killing Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, and Ethan Chapin on Nov. 13, 2022, in their off-campus house in Moscow."

  "argos_summary": "Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology PhD student, admitted to murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022 and avoided the death penalty through a plea deal, sparking outrage from victims\u2019 families. Digital forensics revealed his phone contained disturbing porn searches, creepy selfies, and obsessive calls to his parents, painting a picture of a disturbed loner who tried to cover his tracks but left key evidence. Prosecutors highlighted several investigative blunders\u2014such as leaving DNA on a knife sheath, buying a weapon on Amazon, and cleaning his car too thoroughly\u2014that ultimately linked him to the crime scene. After his conviction, Kohberger was transferred to Idaho\u2019s maximum\u2011security prison, where inmates reportedly harass him through vents, while the state emphasizes that such behavior is a normal form of prisoner communication.
