  "description": "The last American standing will face a tennis legend for a ticket to the semifinals.",
  "content": "The only American man still standing in the US Open men\u2019s singles draw will face a tennis legend tonight for a spot in the semifinal round.\n\nTaylor Fritz entered the US Open as the reigning runner-up and the highest-ranked American at No. 4. After several upsets during the first week of the tournament, Fritz is the only American left in the tournament, and the sole chance the United States has to produce a men\u2019s grand slam winner since Andy Roddick\u2019s 2003 US Open victory.\n\nIn tonight\u2019s quarterfinal, Fritz will face No. 7 Novak Djokovic. As a 24-time Grand Slam champion tied for the most all-time among men or women, Djokovic is chasing his record-breaking 25th in this year\u2019s US Open.\n\nHead-to-head, Djokovic and Fritz have met 10 times before, including in the quarterfinal round of the 2023 US Open, and most recently at an ATP Masters 1000 event in Shanghai. Djokovic is currently 10-0 against Fritz.\n\nThe quarterfinal match between Fritz and Djokovic is set to begin at approximately 8:30 p.m. ET tonight, Sept. 2. It will follow the quarterfinal between Aryna Sabalenka and Marketa Vondrousova, which begins at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nHow to watch Taylor Fritz vs. Novak Djokovic for free\n\nIf you don\u2019t have cable or a TV antenna, you\u2019ll need a live TV streaming service to stream matches from the US Open live for free. One option we love is DIRECTV, which comes with five days free and starts at $49.99/month, with plenty of subscription options and genre packs that include ESPN.\n\nYou can also watch every US Open match, including tonight\u2019s, on ESPN\u2019s new DTC streaming service. The $11.99/month Select plan will give you access to the matches, but springing for the $29.99/month Unlimited package will also include 24/7 live ESPN and more.\n\nWhy Trust Post Wanted by the New York Post\n\nThis article was written by Angela Tricarico, Commerce Streaming Reporter for Post Wanted Shopping, Page Six, and New York Post\u2019s streaming property, Decider.

      "text": "With Taylor Fritz the last hope for American men in the U.S. Open, he\u2019ll face a quarterfinal date vs. Novak Djokovic \u2014 the formidable foe he\u2019s never defeated.\nWith Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul gone, can the always crazy crowd at Flushing Meadows push Fritz \u2014 America\u2019s ultimo hombre \u2014 to finally break through?\n\u201cIt can be a good thing for me. Hopefully, the crowd is really going to get behind me now because I\u2019m the last guy,\u201d said Fritz, 27. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s surprising. I think it\u2019s just been a rough week for the guys. \u2026 I\u2019m happy to be here, and hopefully, if the crowd can get behind me, we can do this.\u201d\nIt\u2019ll be something Fritz has never done. The Californian was a finalist here last year, but he\u2019s winless against Djokovic. He\u2019s 0-10 against the Serb and has dropped 23 of the 26 sets they\u2019ve played.\n\u201cThe first seven or eight times I played him, I just wasn\u2019t a good enough player to really have much of a chance unless I have the best day ever and he has a bad day,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cOnly the last couple times we\u2019ve played, I\u2019ve been a better player that can, I\u2019d say, compete and have chances.\n\u201cLast time we played in Shanghai, I had looks. I had set points in the second set. I really should\u2019ve probably won the second, taken it to a third set.\u201d\nFritz served for the set in the Shanghai Masters before Djokovic pulled out a 6-4, 7-6 (6) win. Djokovic also needed a first-set tiebreaker to take a tough four-set win earlier last year in the Australian Open. And Fritz had served for a set in the 2022 ATP Final before the Serb gutted out a 7-6 (5), 7-6 (6) victory.\nIn short, the same way Coco Gauff broke through against Iga Swiatek \u2014 taking the past three after dropping 11 of her first dozen \u2014 there is no magic trick.\n\u201cThe way to turn it around is just to become a better player. Coco would probably say the same thing,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about all the losses I had to Novak \u2026 five years ago. I was nowhere near the level of player that I am now.\n\u201cIn the most recent matches we\u2019ve had, there\u2019s been looks. I just haven\u2019t been able to make it happen in the important moments of those matches. That\u2019s what makes the best guys the best guys. They\u2019re not going to give it to you in those moments. You have to go and take it.\u201d\nWhile Djokovic, 38, has been a pain in the neck for Fritz, he had to overcome pain in his own neck in the Round of 16.\nThe 24-time Slam winner needed multiple visits from ATP physiotherapist Clay Sniteman, working on his right shoulder and neck, then his right firearm.\n\u201c[Fritz] is knocking on that door,\u201d said Djokovic.\n\u201cTaylor definitely is one of the guys that no doubt has a game, has a potential to be a Grand Slam winner. He was playing finals here last year. He was one match away, so there\u2019s no reason not to believe that he can make it. Hopefully, not this year, but any other year is fine.\u201d"

      "text": "For the first time this year at the U.S. Open, Novak Djokovic inched closer to looking more like himself in his third-round match.\nThe Serbian had not played a competitive singles match since Wimbledon and won two subpar matches to kick off the year\u2019s final Grand Slam. It has been a slow start to the tournament, but his Friday night performance proved to be enough in a 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-3 win over Cameron Norrie in nearly three hours.\nThe crucial hiccups that there were, though, could have thrown off the match against a stronger opponent.\n\u201cMy team wants me to suffer on the court so I can get some more minutes spent on match play,\u201d Djokovic said on the court after the win. \u201cIt\u2019s good that I get tested. I haven\u2019t had any matches since Wimbledon \u2026 still trying to find my groove. I think this is the best I\u2019ve played so far in the tournament.\u201d\nOne came late in the first set and it looked like Djokovic was at risk of retiring from the match for an early night at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nFor eight straight games in the first set, he was wowing the crowd with nine aces against the Englishman after having a total of 10 just a match ago.\nYet, after breaking Norrie in the seventh game and powering four aces across the net to take the next for a 5-3 set lead, Djokovic started to rub and stretch out his back with a grimace on his face after a net point.\nHe eventually called for a trainer and was evaluated off court during a break, prompting a medical timeout.\nDjokovic came back out, settling crowd nerves, and took the first set, 6-4. Yet, it was a less mobile version of himself and during another break, trainers came back out to tend to him, rubbing his back.\n\u201cIn terms of how I\u2019m feeling, it really goes up and down, to be honest,\u201d he said in his post-match news conference. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s frustrating for me, honestly, that I\u2019m not able to feel 100 percent always like I have for 20-plus years. But yeah, I guess the circumstances are quite different and I have to get used to the fact that every match there\u2019s something that might happen as it has been the case this year pretty much every slam.\u201d\nDjokovic managed to brush it aside and made it a distant memory despite a second set that saw five double faults including one that lost him the set tiebreak to Norrie.\nHe showed separation in the final two sets as the senior player at 38, totaling 18 aces on the night for his most ever in a match at the U.S. Open.\n\u201cI still feel like I enjoy myself competing, can be very hard on myself and my team, I know that, but I still feel like I have game left in me, you know, to play at the highest level,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to keep pushing myself to see, you know, whether I can have a shot at another slam or, you know, any big tournaments.\u201d\nDjokovic\u2019s slow start was also benefited by an early exit by Frances Tiafoe, who lost to qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff in straight sets.\nHe will face the German in the fourth-round on Sunday, setting him up with an easier schedule. Nevertheless, Struff has been on a run \u2014 also beating No. 11 Holger Rune in a five-set second-round thriller."

      "text": "Don\u2019t count out the American men \u2014 or man \u2014 just yet.\nThe last representative, Taylor Fritz, doesn\u2019t look ready to go anywhere.\nThe world No. 4 Fritz is headed back to the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open after his impressive straight-set victory over No. 21 Tomas Machac 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 at Louis Armstrong Stadium.\nThe early departures of No. 6 Ben Shelton, No. 14 Tommy Paul and No. 17 Frances Tiafoe left only Fritz.\nIf that brought any added pressure, he didn\u2019t show it in reaching the quarterfinals in Queens for the third straight year.\n\u201cI guess it can be a good thing for me,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cHopefully, the crowd is really going to get behind me now because I am the last guy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising. I think it\u2019s just been a rough week for the guys. I mean, it\u2019s tough, Ben with the injury, then I think [Tiafoe] and Tommy just ran into some guys who were dangerous players, playing really good tennis, so it happens.\u201d\nNot to the 27-year-old Fritz.\nHe conceded just 13 points on his dominant serve without facing a break point in the brief one-hour, 38-minute rout.\nHe broke Machac late in each of the first two sets to take a commanding lead.\nIn the third, a Machac double-fault gave Fritz an early break, and he cruised from there.\nAfter dropping a set in his previous two matches, he didn\u2019t have nearly as much trouble.\nFritz did enough in the return game and was in complete control with his overpowering serve, notching 14 aces and winning an absurd 35 of 39 points on his first serve.\n\u201cI thought it was definitely the best match I have played so far in this tournament,\u201d he said.\nFritz advances to face No. 7 Novak Djokovic, the 24-time Grand Slam champion.\nThe two have met 10 times before, with Fritz losing each matchup.\nHe obviously is a different player now, compared to several of their earlier encounters.\n\u201cI think the way to turn it around is just to become a better player,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cFor me, in my head, I\u2019m not thinking about all the losses I had to Novak, I don\u2019t know, like, five years ago. I was nowhere near the level of player that I am now.\u201d\nLast summer, he broke through here to reach the final, where he lost to Jannik Sinner.\nIn doing so, Fritz became the first American man to play for a Grand Slam title in 15 years.\nThe last American to win a major was Andy Roddick 22 years ago at the U.S. Open.\nThe hope was that the drought would end in this tournament.\nWhile only one American reached the fourth round, a disappointing result after four U.S. men got to that point a year ago, Fritz is carrying the torch pretty well for the time being.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be here,\u201d he said, \u201cand hopefully, like I said, if the crowd can get behind me, we can do this.\u201d"

      "text": "Instead of the American men having a tennis breakthrough, they had a breakdown.\nBen Shelton and Frances Tiafoe both crashed out of the U.S. Open in third-round upset losses on Friday. They\u2019d been tipped to end America\u2019s 22-year drought in men\u2019s majors, but instead suffered major heartbreak in Flushing Meadows.\nAfter Pat McEnroe had boldly predicted before this U.S. Open that an American man would finally win here for the first time since Andy Roddick in 2003, Shelton was leading unseeded Adrian Mannarino when he injured his shoulder and retired at the start of the fifth set. An hour later, Tiafoe was ousted by Jan-Lennard Struff, the German winning 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7).\n\u201c[The pain level] was really high. I never retired before. I\u2019m not a guy who would retire if I could continue,\u201d said Shelton, who retired for the first time of his Tour-level career.\n\u201cUsually I\u2019ll play through anything and just find a way. And whether it\u2019s sickness or injury, if I can stay out there, I can stay out there. I never felt anything like this before. So, that was kind of tough.\u201d\nIt was tough for American men\u2019s tennis as a whole.\nThe sixth-seeded Shelton was amid a career-best season and seen as potentially the best chance at breaking the U.S. men\u2019s skid.\nShelton had won a dramatic set point to take the third set and go up 6-3, 3-6. 6-4. But, in doing so, he took a fall to the Louis Armstrong Stadium court. The tumble may have proved costly.\nWhile Shelton said he\u2019s not sure what caused the injury, he went for a big forehand in the opening game of the fourth set and immediately grimaced in pain. He clutched at his shoulder and tried to play through it. Shelton did manage to save a break point, but immediately signaled to coach Bryan Shelton, his father.\nThree points into the next game, Shelton had to take a medical timeout with a trainer working on his shoulder. Even when he resumed, a compromised Shelton had to change his entire game, charging the net rather than his usual first-strike style and pounding the ball from the baseline.\nEventually, Shelton lost the fourth set 6-4. After talking with his father, he resolved to retire. He walked off the court with towel draped over his face.\nShelton said he was unsure if he\u2019d need any imaging. What\u2019s clear is this is a golden opportunity missed, with even Mannarino admitting a healthy Shelton likely would\u2019ve won.\n\u201cEven if I\u2019m giving a little trouble to him, he\u2019s still a better player than me,\u201d Mannarino said. \u201cSo, yeah, bad luck.\u201d\nIt got worse for American tennis an hour later as Tiafoe suffered a straight-sets loss on the Grandstand court.\nHe was broken five times, while he saw Struff score on 88 percent of his first serves.\n\u201cI was late on a lot of balls, just scrubbing them to be on offense, and he was dictating play. \u2026 The match was always kind of on his racket,\u201d Tiafoe said. \u201cI had a little window there when he just gave me some gifts; I didn\u2019t take it. But I played extremely passive; I didn\u2019t put any pressure on him at all.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to tip my hat to him. He made me feel very, very [uncomfortable], and I didn\u2019t do a very good job of adjusting. It is what it is. I\u2019ve got to swallow it; very, very tough.\u201d\nTiafoe had his back taped but said it was precautionary and wouldn\u2019t use that as an excuse.\n\u201cNo, I had no issues. I felt good, and I\u2019ve had those all the matches,\u201d Tiafoe said. \u201cSo, no, I don\u2019t want to use that.\u201d\nThis comes after Tiafoe was ousted in the second round at both Wimbledon and the Australian Open.\nTiafoe didn\u2019t expect to have company on his way out from countryman Shelton, whom he assumed was on his way to the fourth round.\n\u201cI saw he was up two sets to one on the court, and that was it; I just figured he probably won,\u201d Tiafoe said. \u201cThat always sucks to go out like that. I\u2019ve had that feeling, but especially in a Grand Slam where actually it was most like he was probably going to win, very, very tough.\u201d\nWith Tiafoe\u2019s loss and Shelton\u2019s injury, American hopes entering Friday night were pinned on No. 4 Taylor Fritz as he prepared to face Jerome Kym."

      "text": "For many, one of the biggest fears anyone considering getting rid of their cable or satellite box is whether they can still watch live TV. While cutting the cord may mean paying a lower monthly bill, many wannabe streamers still like to watch events like news and sports live \u2014 like the good old days.\nCutting the cord doesn\u2019t have to mean giving up watching live TV entirely. A selection of services allows streaming these coveted sports games live over the internet. Dubbed live TV streaming services, these services with Live TV differ from monthly or yearly subscription-based streaming sites like Netflix, Hulu and Disney+. Live TV streaming services, like Sling TV and Hulu + Live TV, offer a more complete opportunity to cut those cords that bind you while still giving you access to live local and national news and sports channels \u2014 for a price. But there are also free live streaming options to plug some holes, like Pluto TV.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the best alternative to cable while still retaining the ability to watch TV. Here are the best live TV streaming services you can get right now and how they compare.\n- Best Live TV Streaming Service Overall: Hulu + Live TV\n- Best Budget Live TV Streaming Service: Philo\n- Best Cable Alternative Live TV Streaming Service: DIRECTV Stream \u2014 save up to $60 on your first three months\n- Best Live TV Streaming Service for Sports: Fubo \u2014 save $5 on your first month\n- Best Live TV Streaming Service for Add-Ons: Sling TV \u2014 save 50% on your first month\nBest Live TV Streaming Service Overall: Hulu + Live TV\nPros:\n- Over 90 channels included\n- Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+ included\n- Unlimited DVR\nCons:\n- Can only stream on two screens at once\n- Free trial is only 3 days\n- One of the more expensive live TV services\n- Number of channels: 95+\n- Top channels: Live local ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox; ESPN; FS1; FX\n- Simultaneous streams: Up to two at once\nNot only will Hulu + Live TV stream all your live TV, but it also comes with three great streaming services as a bonus. A subscription will get you access to Hulu, Disney+, ESPN+, and over 90 live TV channels. We\u2019ve found that Hulu + Live TV has the most inclusive and well-rounded selection of channels included with a base subscription \u2014 unlike some of the other services, which only offer some fairly common channels in add-on packages, the only add-ons Hulu + Live TV offers (aside from premium channels like Max, Starz, and Showtime) are for more specialized channels. You can stream on two screens at a time and all subscriptions now come with unlimited cloud DVR storage.\nHulu + Live TV costs $82.99/month (with ad-supported Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+) or $95.99/month if you want to upgrade to ad-free versions of Hulu and Disney+ (ESPN+ will still be ad-supported).\nBest Budget Live TV Streaming Service: Philo\nPros:\n- Super affordable\n- 70+ channels\n- One week free trial\n- AMC+ included at no extra charge\nCons:\n- No local news channels\n- Number of channels: 70+\n- Top channels: MTV, Paramount Network, AMC, Hallmark Channel\n- Simultaneous streams: Up to three at once\nPhilo, which is the cheapest live TV streaming service, is perfect for those who love lifestyle content. The service includes over 70 channels in their base plan, which costs just $28.00/month.\nThere are no live news channels or local channels, save for BBC News, on Philo, so if that\u2019s where your interests really lie, Philo might not be the best live TV streaming service for you. But if you can\u2019t get enough House Hunters, 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, and Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, this is the best live TV streaming service for you. The channel lineup is primarily focused on lifestyle, with networks like Hallmark Channel, HGTV, Great American Family, MTV, TLC, Discovery, and more, all included in the $28.00/month price tag.\nOur review: \u201cPhilo is a true hidden gem in the wild world of over-the-top streamers. An affordable alternative to YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, Philo offers 70+ channels and unlimited DVR space for only $28/month. The service doesn\u2019t include local network channels, but it does offer a host of popular cable options like A&E, AMC, AMC+, Comedy Central, BET, Hallmark Channel, and Paramount Network. Wanna give it a go? Philo offers a seven-day free trial for new subscribers.\u201d \u2014 Josh Sorokach\nBest Cable Alternative Live TV Streaming Service: DIRECTV Stream\nPros:\n- Local news and sports channels\n- Free trial\n- Unlimited DVR\nCons:\n- More expensive than most live TV streaming services\n- Number of channels: 90+\n- Top channels: Live local ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox; regional sports networks, ESPN\n- Simultaneous streams: Unlimited on same Wi-fi network\nWhat sets DIRECTV Stream apart from other live TV streaming services is the channel selection that mimics the kind of selection you\u2019d get from a traditional cable subscription with cable boxes and all of that.\nIn addition to including all your local news channels, like affiliates of ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox, you\u2019ll also get your local sports channels \u2014 the specialized networks like MSG or YES in New York and various regional Bally Sports affiliates \u2014 based on the market you\u2019re located in.\nWe\u2019ve found that this service has the most well-rounded selection of local channels in a base plan, but to get the sports channels, you\u2019ll have to upgrade to a more expensive plan. The base Entertainment + Sports Pack costs $101.98/month, while the Choice plan with local sports is $114.98/month (but right now, you can save up to $60 on your first three months).\nBest Live TV Streaming Service for Sports: Fubo\nPros:\n- Free trial\n- Premium add-ons\n- Base plan has the most channels of any live service\nCons:\n- Some basic channels require upgrading past base plan\n- Unlimited DVR and 4K quality cost extra per month\n- Number of channels: 214+\n- Top channels: Live local ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox; regional sports networks, ESPN\n- Simultaneous streams: Up to 10\nWhat makes Fubo the best streaming service for live sports is the wide array of live sports channels included in the 180+ channel base plan. From local sports channels and ESPN to international channels like Bein and niche sports networks like NBC Golf, if you want to watch a sporting event, odds are, Fubo has it \u2014 even your regional sports networks, if you subscribe to the Pro plan or higher.\nFubo TV has three plans starting at $79.99/month. They also have a few add-on packages priced monthly, but upgrading past the base plan will give you those channels included at a discount. You can also add premium channels and add-ons like Starz, NBA League Pass, Paramount+ with Showtime, and MGM+.\nBest Live TV Streaming Service for Add-Ons: Sling TV\nPros:\n- Affordable\n- Huge selection of add-ons\nCons:\n- Plans can be confusing and only have up to 46 channels\n- No free trial\n- Only 50 hours of DVR storage without paying extra\n- Number of channels: 35+\n- Top channels: Live local ABC, NBC, Fox; ESPN; Fox news\n- Simultaneous streams: Up to 4 (but Orange plan only allows 1)\nIf customizing your channel offerings is important to you, you can\u2019t go wrong with Sling TV. The service has two base plans, Blue and Orange \u2014 each offers different channels \u2014 starting at $45.99/month. You can also combine the two starting at $65.99/month. The base plans only have up to 46 channels, and the rest (including channels that other services have inside of their base plans) have to be added on.\nOnce the base plan is picked, Sling has more add-ons than any other live TV service, so you can pick and choose different premium channels (often with sweet deals attached), niche interest channels, and bundles, until Sling TV is full of everything you want to watch.\nThese are just a few of the add-on highlights:\n- Sling Blue + Sports Extra (15 channels for $11/month)\n- Sling Blue and Orange + Sports Extra (20 channels for $15/month)\n- Max (half off your first month, $5 off every subsequent month)\n- Paramount+ with Showtime ($5 for your first month, then $10/month)\n- Starz ($5 for your first month, then $10.99/month)\n- AMC+ ($5 for your first month, then $9.99/month)\nOther Streaming Services With Specific Live TV Options:\n- Paramount+: Paramount+ with Showtime ($11.99/month) subscribers can watch their local CBS channel live 24/7, in addition to a handful of sporting events like NFL on CBS, The Masters, March Madness games, and more.\n- Our review: I enjoy Paramount+ because it allows me to watch live sports with convenient features like rewinding and fast-forwarding, or even starting a game from the beginning if I miss a key moment like a goal or penalty. It brings back a nostalgic feel, reminding me of the days when cable TV was the go-to option. Beyond sports, Paramount+ offers a great selection of classic TV shows, keeps me updated with daily news, and even provided a smooth experience streaming the Golden Globes with minimal interruptions. \u2014 Maeve Degan\n- Peacock: If you subscribe to Peacock Premium Plus ($11.99/month), you\u2019ll be able to watch your local NBC affiliate live. Any live sports on Peacock are open to both subscription tiers to stream.\n- ESPN+: Get your sports fix with live NHL, MLB, NFL, golf tournaments, UFC and more with ESPN+ for $10.99/month.\n- Max: With Max\u2019s Bleacher Report Sports add-on (currently free for all subscribers), you\u2019ll be able to stream NBA, NFL, NCAA, and other sports and leagues that air on TNT and TBS. The linear HBO cable networks are also always live on Max. You\u2019ll also be able to watch live CNN 24/7 with the new News section.\nWhy Trust Decider Shopping\nThis article was written by Angela Tricarico, Commerce Streaming Reporter for Decider, the New York Post, and Page Six.

      "text": "A week into the U.S. Open, the once-promising American men are down to one representative.\nOn Friday, sixth-seeded Ben Shelton and No. 17 Frances Tiafoe were eliminated.\nSaturday night, Tommy Paul joined them, leaving just Taylor Fritz, the fourth seed, left on the men\u2019s side.\nThe 14th-seed, who had advanced to the quarterfinals of both the Australian and French Open earlier this year, was sent packing by No. 23 Alexander Bublik 7-6 (5), 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-1 at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nLast year, four American men reached the fourth round, with Fritz facing Tiafoe in an all-American semifinal.\nThat was sliced to one this time around.\nPaul had no answer for Bublik\u2019s big serve, failing to break him once during the entire 3-hour, 38-minute match.\nHe had just six opportunities, needing tiebreakers in the second and fourth sets to push it to the limit.\nBut Paul lost his serve early in the fifth set and found himself in a love-three hole.\nIt didn\u2019t get any better for Paul.\nHe lost his serve again, this time at love.\nBy then, the end was near.\nIt has been 22 years since an American man won the U.S. Open \u2014 Andy Roddick in 2003.\nIf that drought is going to end, Fritz will have to get it done.\nHe reached the final here last summer, becoming the first to play for a Grand Slam title in 15 years.\nFritz lost to Jannik Sinner in straight sets.\nHe will face No. 21 Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mach\u00e1c in the fourth round on Sunday.\nPaul\u2019s third-round exit marked his earliest departure from the U.S. Open since 2022.\nHe reached the fourth round the previous two years."

      "text": "We\u2019re at the height of the Streaming Wars, and deciding for which platform you\u2019re willing to pay a premium can be as challenging as figuring out your favorite ice cream on a hot summer\u2019s day. There are countless options, each offering a similarly satisfying selection, with something new debuting seemingly every week.\nHowever, some are just better than others. It all depends on what mood you\u2019re in, right? Well, much like ice cream, there are streaming services that offer something yummy for just about everyone\u2019s taste.\n- Disney+ with Hulu and HBO Max bundle \u2014 save up to 42% monthly\n- Disney+ with Hulu and ESPN bundle \u2014 save over 39% monthly\n- Prime Video subscription \u2014 add channels like HBO Max, Paramount+\n- Starz via Prime Video \u2014 get three months for $3.99/month\nSimiles aside, the reality is that streaming services are how most TV watchers watch TV. According to data aggregator Statista, there will be over 182.26 million streaming service users in the U.S. this year. By 2027, that number is predicted to be nearly 202.6 million.\nStreaming can quickly get pricey, though \u2014 that\u2019s the beauty of deal packages like the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ bundle, or HBO Max, which bundles a ton of Discovery networks (Food Network, TLC, etc.) with all things HBO and live sports from TNT and TBS, all for one low price. Even streamers like Prime Video have bundle options: with Prime Video Channels, you can add a number of streamers onto your Prime Video app.\nSo how do you decide what you need? Easy. You come to Decider.\nDisney+\nIf shows like Andor and Ironheart are on your radar, you\u2019ll want to purchase a Disney+ subscription. In addition to movies and series from the classic Walt Disney collection, it also gives parents and fans of all ages access to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (so you can finally watch all the Marvel movies in order), plus Pixar, Star Wars, National Geographic, and even 20th Century Fox content like The Simpsons and some Hulu titles.\nCurrently, Disney+ offers multiple bundle options to fit various budgets and needs. The basic ad-supported plan costs $9.99/month, but to get Disney+ ad-free, you\u2019ll pay $15.99/month. Based on these prices, a bundle option may be more cost-effective if you were already considering subscribing to Hulu, ESPN+, or HBO Max, or are already a subscriber of any of those services.\n- Disney+ and Hulu bundle with ads \u2013 $10.99/month (save 44% monthly)\n- Disney+ and Hulu bundle ad-free \u2013 $19.99/month (save 42% monthly)\n- Disney+, Hulu, ESPN Select bundle with ads \u2013 $16.99/month (save 46% monthly)\n- Disney+, Hulu, ESPN Select bundle ad-free \u2013 $26.99/month (save 42% monthly)\n- Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads \u2013 $16.99/month (save 43% monthly)\n- Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle ad-free \u2013 $29.99/month (save 42% monthly)\n- Disney+, Hulu, ESPN Unlimited bundle with ads \u2013 $29.99/month (save 40% monthly)\n- Disney+, Hulu, ESPN Unlimited bundle ad-free \u2013 $28.99/month (save 40% monthly)\nWhat to look forward to on Disney+ in 2025: Lilo and Stitch (9/3), LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy \u2013 Pieces of the Past (9/15), Percy Jackson and the Olympians Season 2 (12/10), Ahsoka Season 2 (TBA), Wonder Man (TBA), Elio (TBA), The Fantastic Four: First Steps (TBA)\nAmazon Prime Video\nSuppose, for whatever reason, you haven\u2019t succumbed to the Amazon juggernaut yet.

Amazon Prime currently costs $14.99/month or $139.00/year. If you\u2019re not interested in all that Prime offers, the company offers a standalone subscription to Prime Video for $8.99/month.\nAs of January 2024, Prime Video plays limited ads during movies and shows, but you can pay an additional $2.99/month to remove them.\nYou can also add over 100 streaming services onto your Prime Video subscription to combine multiple subscriptions into one service.

It provides flexible access across devices, allowing fans to watch their favorite sports anytime, anywhere. Known for exclusive rights to major fights and leagues in various countries, DAZN is a go-to platform for dedicated sports enthusiasts.\nMost major MMA fights require both a subscription and a PPV. If you prefer a more flexible option, you can subscribe to DAZN for $29.99/month, but you can also subscribe to a Monthly Saver plan that locks you into a $19.99/month plan for 12 months \u2014 that\u2019s 33% cheaper than the flexible monthly plan when you add it all up.\nHulu + Live TV\nHulu + Live TV will stream all your live TV, and it also comes with three great streaming services as a bonus. A subscription will get you access to Hulu, Disney+, ESPN+, and over 90 live TV channels all for $82.99/month.\nWe\u2019ve found that Hulu + Live TV has the most inclusive and well-rounded selection of channels included with a base subscription \u2014 unlike some of the other services, which only offer some fairly common channels in add-on packages, the only add-ons Hulu + Live TV offers (aside from premium channels like Max, Starz, and Showtime) are for more specialized channels. You can stream on two screens at a time and all subscriptions now come with unlimited cloud DVR storage\nNordVPN\nTo watch anything from anywhere, a VPN like NordVPN will be your new streaming best friend.\nKnown for its fast and reliable server connections, NordVPN is regarded as one of the best options in the market. It has an expansive collection of servers worldwide. More importantly, it comes equipped with several privacy and security features that protect your device against malware and keep your browsing safe and anonymous.\nThe service offers 1-and-2-year plans that start as low as $3.39/month paid all at once (paid monthly, plans start at $12.99/month), and often have free months thrown in to extend your coverage further \u2014 right now, it\u2019s up to one year free.\nNetflix\nFar from the days of mailing DVDs in red sleeves, Netflix is still the largest streaming service in the world, with over 240 million subscribers worldwide. If you aren\u2019t one of those customers, it may be time to consider the monthly plans. In addition to a massive library of TV shows and movies, Netflix has its own studio. It offers an impressive stream of popular original films and shows, like steamy Shondaland favorite Bridgerton and fan favorites like Squid Game and, of course, Stranger Things.\nThe streamer currently offers three plans, with the cheapest being the most recent addition to its lineup. For $7.99/month, you can stream Netflix in standard definition with ads. To get rid of ads, plans start at $17.99/month for full high definition, and $24.99/month for streaming in up to 4K UHD on up to four screens at a time.\nAs Netflix recently cracked down on password sharing, you can add profiles for people who don\u2019t live in your immediate household to your account for $6.99/month extra if you have either of the two ad-free plans.\nWhat sports are streaming on Netflix?
