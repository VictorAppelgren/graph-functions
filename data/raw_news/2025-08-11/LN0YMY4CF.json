  "description": "Is Rumble about to become a bigger player in the artificial intelligence (AI) space?",
  "content": "\u2022 Rumble stock surged today as investors focused in on a potential growth bet the company is aiming to make.\n\u2022 The company wants to acquire high-performance-computing (HPC) specialist Northern Data in an all-stock deal.\n\u2022 A buyout deal could be forthcoming, but there are still some big questions about Rumble's core streaming business.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Rumble \u203a\n\nRumble (NASDAQ: RUM) stock posted gains in Monday's trading. The streaming and crypto player's share price closed out the day's trading up 3.3%, but had been up as much as 19.3% earlier in the session. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) both dipped 0.3% on the day's trading.\n\nRumble stock rocketed out of the gates at the start of today's trading in response to speculative bets relating to some moves that the company is aiming to make in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. The gains faded as the day's trading progressed, but the stock still ended the session solidly in the green.\n\nAlong with the second-quarter report that it published on Aug. 10, Rumble announced that it is interested in acquiring AI company Northern Data. The high-performance-computing (HPC) specialist has yet to signal that it's open to being acquired, and no valuation level has been set on Rumble's all-stock offer to acquire the company. Despite the shortage of information related to the potential buyout, investors showed signs of approval in today's trading and bid the streaming stock up to levels significantly exceeding yesterday's close.\n\nWhile plays in the AI and cryptocurrency spaces could help boost valuation momentum, Rumble's recent quarterly results continue to raise questions about the company's outlook. The business posted a loss of $0.12 per share on sales of $25.08 million in the second quarter. For comparison, the average analyst estimate had called for a loss of $0.07 per share on sales of roughly $26.8 million.\n\nRumble closed out the quarter with an average of 51 million monthly active users (MAUs), down from 59 million MAUs in this year's first quarter and 53 million MAUs in Q2 2024. On the other hand, average revenue per user was actually up 24% year over year to $0.42.\n\nOn balance, Rumble streaming engagement and monetization still looks somewhat shaky -- and that puts added pressure on other growth initiatives.\n\nDo the experts think Rumble is a buy right now?\n\nThe Motley Fool\u2019s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities. They\u2019ve just revealed their 10 best stocks to buy now \u2014 did Rumble make the list?",

      "text": "New streaming TV options have launched at a frenzied pace over the last few years. With many subscription internet TV services to choose from, streaming entertainment has become ubiquitous in U.S. homes.\nConsumers spend increasingly large amounts of time on streaming media, so TV providers are responding by rapidly migrating their advertising activity over to those streaming platforms.\nThe streaming phenomenon\nThe streaming phenomenon\nWe stream a lot of content. The average person spends 4.3 hours streaming video content each day.\nOur streaming habits are generating a growing stream of revenue for content companies from subscriptions and advertising. The over-the-top streaming market is on track to grow from $172 billion in 2023 to $198.1 billion in 2024.\nThat growing revenue stream is making streaming stocks look like compelling long-term investments. Here's a look at the best streaming TV service stocks to invest in.\nState of Streaming\nThe Motley Fool surveyed 2,000 Americans about their streaming habits and preferences to find out what the future might hold for streaming services.\nBest streaming service stocks\nBest streaming service stocks in 2025\nThere are many ways to gain portfolio exposure to streaming services. Here, we focus on the companies that are either pure plays or earn outsized returns on streaming.\nThe best streaming entertainment stocks include industry pioneer Netflix (NFLX 0.57%), entertainment giant Disney (DIS 0.17%), and streaming platform leader Roku (ROKU -1.42%).\nCash Flow\n1. Netflix\nAs the company that started the streaming TV party, Netflix remains the largest streaming pure play, with more than 280 million subscribers. More than a third of video streamers rate Netflix as their favorite streaming platform due to its interface and user experience.\nNetflix is a prolific producer of TV shows and movies to provide its growing user base with more content. It has also expanded into new areas to accelerate its business growth, including live sporting events and video games. Netflix has also started allowing advertisers to tap into its engaged user base.\nThe company's strategy has paid off. It's generating a growing stream of free cash flow. That's allowing it to start returning money to shareholders through a meaningful share repurchase program.\n2. The Walt Disney Company\nThe much-anticipated Disney+ streaming service was launched in late 2019, just in time for the pandemic. By late 2024, Disney had 56 million domestic subscribers and another 66.7 million international ones. Disney also owns streaming services Hulu and ESPN+ in the U.S.\nAfter years of heavy investment, Disney's direct-to-consumer streaming services are now profitable. That helped boost the entertainment, sports, and experiences giant's overall profitability.\nThe company's vertically integrated operations -- spanning valuable real estate assets in its theme parks, merchandising, broadcast television, and in-house video production technology -- give it plenty of cash to invest in new content.\nNow well-established in the online TV era, Disney is poised to continue leading in the streaming revolution.\nVertically Integrated\n3. Roku\nStreaming TV has been a boon for the smart TV and streaming device maker. Roku has become the largest TV platform in the U.S., distributing content via The Roku Channel and acting as a hub for households to manage all their streaming subscriptions. The company has more than 85.5 million active accounts worldwide. They streamed a combined 32 billion hours of content in the third quarter of 2024 alone.\nRoku distributes its smart TV software and streaming devices at minimal cost, making money instead through advertising and by managing subscriptions. In addition, the company acquired Nielsen's Advanced Video Advertising segment to maximize its streaming ad platform's effectiveness.\nActing as the gateway into internet-based TV for tens of millions of households, Roku is a top way to invest in the growing streaming industry. Much like other high-growth streaming platforms, though, Roku has struggled with controlling its costs. Monitor the company's progress as it turns the corner on profitability so it can operate sustainably.\nBest streaming advertising stocks\nBest streaming advertising stocks in 2025\nAdvertising software firms are key to helping streaming video content creators monetize their work and capture new subscribers. They also help companies to advertise within streaming media.\nIn this new era of abundantly available at-home entertainment, traditional media companies are faced with new challenges. Chief among them is paying for and profiting from making a TV show or movie.\nStreaming shows and movies are monetized via monthly subscriptions and online ads rather than global box office or cable TV advertising. As companies seek to advertise via streaming media and content producers look for businesses wanting to purchase ad time, The Trade Desk (TTD -1.98%) and PubMatic (PUBM -2.84%) are well positioned to profit.\n1. The Trade Desk\nThis cloud-based software company is a buy-side platform, meaning it helps automate the purchasing and management of marketing campaigns for companies that pay for advertising.\nStreaming television (also known as connected TV, or CTV) has been one of the fastest-growing segments for The Trade Desk, and it's likely to remain so for some time as the entertainment industry rapidly migrates to internet-based video.\n2. PubMatic\nPubMatic is a sell-side ad platform, meaning its cloud software works with content creators themselves. A sell-side platform is a counterparty to a buy-side platform like The Trade Desk.\nThe company is profitable and focused on ramping up profit margins in the years ahead.\nOther companies offering streaming\nMedia conglomerate companies offer streaming exposure, too\nTelecommunications companies have streaming services, too, such as Comcast's (CMCSA -0.82%) NBCUniversal launching of Peacock. Comcast unveiled plans to spin off its news, sports, and entertainment assets (which include USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, and others) in 2024. That will allow the company to focus on growing its broadband, wireless, streaming, studios, and theme park operations.\nMany of the tech giants offer TV streaming subscription services as well. Amazon (AMZN -0.7%) has Prime Video and add-ons for Prime e-commerce subscribers. Apple (AAPL -0.92%) TV+ has been a steady addition to the iPhone company's \"services\" segment. And Alphabet's (GOOG -0.3%)(GOOGL -0.27%) YouTube TV is a newer subscription designed as an internet-based replacement for cable.\nLegacy companies are also offering new ways to consume live TV over the internet as replacements for traditional cable packages and broadcast television. Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) has reorganized its streaming segment, which includes Paramount+ and the ad-supported service Pluto TV.\nFinally, entertainment conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery (WBD -1.19%), created via the merger of Discovery and WarnerMedia, has a streaming service: Max.\nRelated investing topics\nShould you invest?\nIs investing in streaming services right for you?\nThe streaming TV industry is a crowded space. Investors should keep in mind that this nascent segment of the entertainment industry is not yet very profitable. However, the field is consolidating to a few leaders focused on profitably accumulating subscribers and bringing their ad marketplaces online.\nAs a result of the sector's rapid changes, stock prices of streaming media companies can be volatile. The long-term growth potential of internet-based TV streaming is immense, with streaming services in the next decade set to recreate the way entertainment is consumed.\nFAQs\nFAQS about streaming stocks\nWhat is the best streaming service to invest in?\nNetflix is the best streaming stock to invest in. It's a pure play on streaming and the industry's leader. It's also growing at a solid clip and increasing its profitability and free cash flow.\nWhat is the fastest-growing streaming company?\nAccording to Forbes, Netflix was the fastest-growing streaming service in the first half of 2024. It added 2.6 million subscribers from December 2023 through the end of May 2024, nearly twice as much as Comcast's Peacock service, which added 1.4 million subscribers.\nWhat are streaming stocks?\nStreaming stocks are publicly traded companies that stream video or audio content over the internet.\nCan you buy stock in HBO?\nNo, you can't buy stock in HBO. However, you can invest in Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns HBO."

      "text": "Computers excel at crunching numbers but not at the things that many people do with ease, like language processing, visual perception, object manipulation, reasoning, planning, and learning. Artificial intelligence (AI), including its offshoots of deep learning and machine learning, uses computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as language generation and facial recognition.\nHow do companies use AI?\nHow do companies use artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is created through machine learning, which involves training a system with a tremendous amount of data. It then uses the trained system to make inferences about new data it's never seen.\nThe simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images containing those objects are provided to the system, which \"learns\" how to detect them in other images. The more objects it detects in images, the more accurate the detection system becomes.\nCompanies employ AI in two main ways. Many tech companies use it to make their existing operations more powerful through high-profile applications like robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants. AI is used by Alphabet subsidiary (GOOGL -0.27%) (GOOG -0.3%) Google to filter spam in Gmail, by Amazon (AMZN -0.7%) to recommend products to customers, and by Netflix (NFLX 0.57%) to guide content creation and recommendations.\nMore recently, OpenAI's ChatGPT has shown how far generative AI -- a division of artificial intelligence capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas -- has come. It can answer questions directly, write poems, and has even passed bar and medical exams. It has spawned a wave of new generative AI chatbots, including Anthropic's Claude, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta AI from Meta Platforms (META -0.49%). The potential is enormous.\nThe next frontier for generative AI is AI agents or agentic AI. This is technology allows AI to perform to complete whole tasks without being prompted, such as automated customer service agents. AgentForce from Salesforce (CRM -3.51%) is one example of a new agentic AI tool.\nGenerative AI\nSome companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology requires. These are true AI stocks and include those listed and described below.\n5 AI stocks to buy in 2025\n5 AI stocks to buy in 2025\n| Company | AI Focus |\n|---|---|\n| Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) | Data center GPUs and superchips. |\n| Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | Generative AI and self-driving cars. |\n| Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Memory chips for data centers and generative AI tools. |\n| CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) | Generative AI-focused cloud infrastructure platform. |\n| Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) | AI chatbots, LLMs, and wearable devices. |\n1. Nvidia\nLeading graphics processing unit (GPU) company Nvidia has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its GPUs becoming the de facto standard in data centers worldwide. Generative AI's training phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the inference phase, typically requires less. GPU chips, which were once used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well. Nvidia's ambitions have gone beyond GPUs, as the company now aims to build AI factories or data centers full of Nvidia components to run AI applications and programming.\nNvidia's data center business now makes up the vast majority of the company's revenue, thanks to the emergence of generative AI. Because it sells the building blocks for AI infrastructure, Nvidia became the first major company to see a significant revenue boost from AI. Revenue surged through 2023 and 2024, and the stock has soared as well. It's become the most valuable company in the world on several occasions and was No. 1 in mid-2025. In 2024, full-year revenue jumped 114% to $130.5 billion, driven by the surge in data center demand.\nIts chips are popular for running demanding workloads that applications like large language models require. The pure-play chip stock is now selling its new Blackwell platform, which major cloud infrastructure services are deploying in 2025, and demand is outstripping supply.\nSelf-driving cars and \"physical AI\" are other areas of focus. Nvidia develops hardware and software platforms that can power driver-assistance features and fully autonomous driving, which could be a significant source of revenue if that industry takes off. Automotive revenue is only a small fraction of the company's revenue, but that could change.\nWith Tesla (TSLA 2.85%) launching its robotaxi network in Austin, the autonomous vehicle race appears to be heating up, and that should be good news for the semiconductor sector.\nA self-driving car must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require tremendous computing power, which is exactly what Nvidia's platform delivers.\nIts professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has potential in AI. Nvidia's chipsets could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but the company is in an enviable position for now.\n2. Alphabet\nAlphabet has been preparing for the AI revolution for years, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014. It's also among the leaders in autonomous vehicles through its Waymo subsidiary, which is now ferrying passengers in its driverless cars in cities including San Francisco and Phoenix.\nAlphabet launched Gemini, its own AI chatbot and the latest iteration in its competition with ChatGPT, which some see as a threat to Google Search. So far, concerns about a challenge to its search dominance seem to have been overblown as Alphabet's ad revenue continues to grow steadily. It said that its Gemini 2.5 has been \"widely recognized as the best model in the industry.\"\nWith information at the heart of its business, it's unsurprising that the company has prioritized AI. It's rolled out AI tools for Google Cloud and Google Workspace, including a generative AI assistant that helps write emails. Even its customer acquisition strategy in the cloud is based around AI -- the company has targeted AI start-ups for its cloud infrastructure service.\nAI also plays a role in improving its search engine and YouTube, where it can pinpoint a relevant section of a video and direct users straight to it.\nFinally, Alphabet is ramping up spending on capital expenditures with plans to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure and related needs in 2025.\n3. Microsoft\nMicrosoft has gotten lots of buzz lately thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. The tech giant began investing in the tech start-up in 2019 and invested another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.\nMicrosoft has incorporated GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Copilot for Microsoft 365. Azure OpenAI has seen a particularly strong uptake, now counting more than 65% of the Fortune 500 as customers.\nCEO Satya Nadella has repeatedly said that he sees AI as the next major computing platform, and the reported $13 billion investment in OpenAI is a sign of the company's conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition or get left behind as it did with mobile.\nMore recently, Microsoft has begun diversifying away from OpenAI, adding both internal and third-party models to products like Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure, including DeepSeek's R1. The long-term implications for its relationship with OpenAI are unclear, but Microsoft seems to think it's wise to hedge its bets in the AI race.\nMicrosoft is also harnessing the power of AI in other ways, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs. It's also using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools.\nThe company launched Azure AI Foundry in November 2024, which allows its customers to create and manage AI apps and agents. As of April 2025, developers at more than 70,000 companies are using it.\n4. CoreWeave\nCoreWeave, which had its initial public offering (IPO) in March 2025, may be the closest thing to a pure-play AI stock on the market, and it was the first major AI IPO.\nIts cloud infrastructure platform was designed specifically for AI, and it counts customers like Nvidia, OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft as part of its core customer base; Nvidia and OpenAI are both investors in the company.\nCoreWeave has grown at an incredible pace over the last three years, going from generating almost nothing in revenue in 2022 to $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024. Between 2022 and 2024, revenue grew by more than 100 times.\nCoreWeave's business is risky since Microsoft accounted for 62% of its revenue, meaning the business would suffer significantly if Microsoft pulled back on spending with the platform. In its first quarter 2025 report, CoreWeave said that no single company accounted for more than half of its backlog, a sign that its customer concentration is improving.\nIf you're looking for direct exposure to AI, CoreWeave is a good option since essentially all of its revenue is driven by the demand for computing power to run generative AI programs. However, the stock is risky since CoreWeave has a high debt burden, has large capital expenditures, and is deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles basis (GAAP).\n5. Meta Platforms\nUnlike the other big tech companies on this list, Meta Platforms doesn't have a cloud computing business, but the company is investing just as much in AI as peers like Alphabet.\nMeta AI, the company's chatbot that's available on its apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, now has 1 billion monthly active users as of May, and it continues to update its Llama large language model, which is now up to Llama 4.\nIt's also allowing its advertisers to use AI creative tools for things like background and video generation and ad copy. AI is also involved in ad targeting, and the company aims to fully automate advertising with AI by 2026.\nAdditionally, the company is incorporating AI in its hardware division, including its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which offer a built-in camera, open-ear audio, and a range of hands-free features. Its Meta Quest headsets are also connected to Meta AI, allowing users to tap into the power of AI through those headsets.\nManagement sees AI at the core of its business and driving its transformation across areas like advertising, experiences, and devices.\nMachine learning stocks\nMachine learning stocks\nAll the stocks above use machine learning technologies, but if you're looking for more options, here are two others worth considering:\n- Palantir (PLTR -2.27%): Palantir has been one of the top-performing AI stocks. The company provides cloud software and specializes in data fusion that helps its customers make important insights by connecting disparate pieces of information hidden in data. It also launched its AI Platform (AIP) in 2023, which has helped accelerate its growth. Palantir deploys machine learning models on top of data foundations and continuously improves them to ensure that they become more useful.\n- Tesla: Best known for its electric vehicles, CEO Elon Musk sees AI as the future of the company, and machine learning and neural networks are very much at the center of the company's autonomous vehicle and Optimus autonomous robot projects. Tesla introduced its driverless Cybercab in October 2024, and the company hopes to begin producing the vehicles by 2026. It launched its robotaxi network in June, though with just a handful of vehicles, and Musk envisions the company expanding to other cities in the near future. Musk has said Tesla's automation technology could make it the most valuable company in the world.\nDeep learning stocks\nDeep learning stocks\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It's the most advanced kind of AI and is crucial in technologies like self-driving cars. Deep learning is advancing in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary. It differs from machine learning in that it doesn't require human input.\nNvidia is among the companies closely associated with deep learning. Its GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.\nAlphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up, Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.\nRelated investing topics\nA growth business\nAI is a growth business\nAccording to International Data Corporation, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $235 billion in 2024 to more than $631 billion in 2028.\nWhile the AI market is already large and still growing quickly, plenty of companies can profit from AI. Although picking stocks in a growth industry comes with a lot of uncertainty, these top AI stocks are all worth considering.\nFAQ\nArtificial intelligence stocks: FAQ\nWhat is the best AI stock to buy?\nArtificial intelligence is a fast-moving technology, and AI stocks will likely be volatile as the sector evolves. AI stocks that have attracted the most attention include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet, but finding the best stock to buy is also a matter of price and valuation, which changes quickly.\nIs it good to buy Nvidia stock?\nNvidia has jumped into the lead among semiconductor companies in making AI chips and accelerators, and it has the competitive advantages to help it stay there. The semiconductor sector can also be highly cyclical, and pricing can change rapidly. Additionally, there's the potential for unexpected surprises like the DeepSeek launch, which sent AI stocks like Nvidia plunging. If Nvidia can maintain its lead in AI chips, the stock should continue to be a winner, but it will likely be volatile since the AI landscape is still developing.\nWhat is the biggest AI company?\nCurrently, the biggest company that has made AI central to its business model is Nvidia, with a market cap that has soared past $3 trillion. The tech giant is at the center of the AI revolution as its components are fueling AI applications and are in high demand by major cloud infrastructure companies and others.\nIs AI good for investing?\nArtificial intelligence is likely to shake up the economy and the business world, creating opportunities in the stock market. Whether AI is good for investing will depend on the company, but there will be winners from the new technology.\nWhat company is No. 1 in AI?\nCurrently, Nvidia is broadly considered the leader in AI technology. The company has a monopoly-like market share in the data center GPU market, and its revenue has more than tripled since ChatGPT launched. Nvidia isn't guaranteed to remain the leader, though. Competition is on the way, and new technologies can change quickly.\nWill AI start-ups challenge tech giants?\nTech giants aren't feeling a significant threat from start-ups yet, but there are some signs that competition is on the rise. Alphabet stock, for example, fell when Apple said it was considering making AI search engines available on Safari, directly competing with Google.\nThe tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft also show that start-ups could begin to pose more of a threat to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, though they are unlikely to derail their growth."
