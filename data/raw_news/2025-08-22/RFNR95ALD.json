  "title": "Robert Moses Tore the South Bronx in Half. Is It About to Happen Again?",
  "description": "It took decades for the Bronx to recover after the Cross Bronx Expressway was built. With years of repairs on the horizon, some residents worry about new trauma.",
  "content": "When Edmundo Martinez was growing up in the South Bronx in the 1980s, his default playground was a patch of land adjacent to the Bronx River, the 23-mile waterway that had passed the previous 140 years morphing into an emblem of urbanization\u2019s darker turns. By the 1840s, the rise of industrialization had made it a dumping ground for grain and paper mills. More than a century later, it had become a repository for old tires, abandoned cars, refrigerators, the detritus of the narcotics trade and the city\u2019s broader decline.\n\n\u201cYou hear over and over that it was an open sewer,\u201d Nilka Martell, chairwoman of the Bronx River Alliance, said. \u201cBut it really was an open sewer.\u201d Now the river and park are quietly lovely, the result of extensive environmental remediation.\n\nThe land surrounding the river had once belonged to William Waldorf Astor, but by the time Mr. Martinez and his friends were throwing a football around, it was public property, loftily named Sheridan Fields, full of brown grass and concrete. \u201cWe had a three-quarter-mile walk to get to a bad park along an expressway,\u201d he told me. Letting children play there made parents nervous, but where else were they to go?",
