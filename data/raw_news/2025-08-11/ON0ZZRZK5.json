The 1990s saw the rise of the expression soccer mom. In the 2000s, we had hipsters.\n\nNow there\u2019s a new term in artificial intelligence programming: vibe coding.\n\nCoined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, vibe coding refers to the writing of computer programs without knowing programming languages. Instead, users use plain language and focus on the vibe of the project.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new kind of coding I call \u2018vibe coding,\u2019 where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials and forget that the code even exists,\u201d wrote Karpathy in a February post on social platform X. \u201cIt\u2019s possible because the [large language models (LLMs)] \u2026 are getting too good.\u201d\n\nFor example, a company can use the Code Interpreter mode in OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 and instruct it to create a chatbot that answers customer questions. The AI model will generate the application for a company to test and refine through more prompts.\n\nSmall\u2013 to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) can turn an idea into a working prototype in hours instead of weeks. Tools from platforms like Google AI Studio are making this process accessible to non-technical users.\n\nSome people have successfully launched businesses after creating apps using vibe coding, CNBC reported in May.\n\nAmjad Masad, CEO of Replit, a coding platform, said in an interview with the Big Technology Podcast that anyone from HR folks to doctors and Uber drivers can now develop apps based on their ideas.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the world has ideas,\u201d Masad said during the interview. \u201cPeople build so much domain knowledge about their field of work, but they never could make it into software because they didn\u2019t have the skill or capital.\u201d\n\nFor example, Maor Shlomo, the non-technical founder of Base44, used vibe coding to create a no-code development platform. Within six months, it attracted 250,000 users and was acquired in June by website creator Wix for $80 million.\n\n\u201cThis new approach allows people to simply express what they want to build, while intelligent agents do the heavy lifting,\u201d Wix said in a statement.\n\nHere\u2019s one way to start, according to CNBC:\n\u2022 None Sign up for the free version of\n\u2022 None Sign up for the free version of\n\nWhat Are the Risks?\n\nIn practice, vibe coding changes the role of the human from writing every line of code to guiding the AI, validating results and deciding what\u2019s ready for production. This enables SMBs to experiment with new offerings, automate tasks or build internal tools without a large IT budget.\n\nVibe coding also gives users a faster way to test ideas, cut development costs and give creative teams the ability to build their own solutions. It can give them a competitive edge, letting small players innovate quickly without the overhead that slows down larger firms, Forbes reported Aug. 4.\n\nHowever, for use in core financial systems, regulated processes or customer-facing platforms that carry legal or financial risks, experienced developers should review the code before launching it, according to the paper, \u201cVibe Coding as a Reconfiguration of Intent Mediation in Software Development: Definition, Implications and Research Agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack box codebases, ethical and data protection blind spots, and inconsistent documentation undermine auditability and verifiability, posing significant barriers to compliance in regulated sectors such as healthcare and finance,\u201d the paper said.\n\nThis speed and accessibility come with trade-offs. AI-generated code can be buggy, not secure, and difficult to maintain if no one fully understands how it works. Also, the technology isn\u2019t yet reliable enough for systems where accuracy, compliance and security are critical, the paper said.\n\nAs a result, companies must carefully weigh the risks and rewards of using vibe coding, ensuring it is used for the right use cases to prevent introducing a new risk to the business.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

      "text": "- Wix News Room\n- Jun 18\n- 6 min read\nBase44 delivers effortless, code-free digital creation through an intuitive, conversational AI experience, which is expected to expand Wix\u2019s reach to new audiences worldwide\nToday Wix announced its acquisition of Base44, an AI-powered platform that enables anyone to create fully-functional, custom software solutions and applications using natural language, without the need for traditional coding. The acquisition adds a powerful new arm to Wix\u2019s AI portfolio, expanding its suite of intelligent solutions that empower anyone to build and grow online.\nThe tech landscape is undergoing a major transformation as vibe coding gains momentum, shifting creation from manual development to intent-driven software development. This new approach allows people to simply express what they want to build, while intelligent agents do the heavy lifting. As demand grows for tools that turn ideas into reality through conversation and intuition rather than code, Wix is working to make the digital world more accessible and creative than ever before. Read CEO Avishai Abrahami\u2019s blog about his vision and the way Wix is shaping this future here.\nBase44\u2019s unique approach offers a fully automated, chat-based interface that manages technical details behind the scenes, from databases and authentication to deployment \u2013 removing the need for third-party integrations or manual setup. This groundbreaking approach opens the door for anyone, regardless of technical expertise, to create production-ready, scalable applications quickly and effortlessly. With proven traction in the market, including B2B partnerships with leaders like eToro and SimilarWeb, Base44 is a powerful addition to the Wix AI portfolio \u2013 furthering the company\u2019s mission to make innovation accessible to creators and businesses worldwide.\n\u201cThis acquisition marks a pivotal milestone in Wix\u2019s commitment to transforming creation online,\u201d said Avishai Abrahami, CEO and Co-founder of Wix. \u201cMaor and his team at Base44 bring cutting-edge technology, strong market penetration, and visionary leadership that seamlessly align with Wix\u2019s dedication to enabling users at all levels of expertise to express their intent while intelligent agents manage execution. Maor\u2019s exceptional talent and innovative mindset will reinforce Wix\u2019s mission to push the boundaries of AI-driven creation and accelerate the evolution of intuitive, intelligent tools that redefine how digital experiences are built and enjoyed.\u201d\n\u201cI honestly can\u2019t think of a better fit. Wix is probably the only company that can help Base44 achieve the scale and distribution it needs while maintaining, if not accelerating, our product velocity,\" said Maor Shlomo, CEO of Base44. \u201cOur market is massive. It has the potential to replace entire software categories by enabling people to create software instead of buying it. Wix\u2019s DNA \u2013 its customer obsession, innovation, and speed \u2013 perfectly aligns with ours, and its scale will catapult Base44 forward at exactly the right time.\u201d\nBase44 will continue to operate as a distinct product and business, maintaining its unique identity and momentum while benefiting from the scale and support of Wix.\nTransaction Terms\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Wix acquired Base44 for initial consideration of approximately $80 million plus additional earn-out payments paid through 2029 predicated upon certain performance metrics.\nWe expect this transaction to have an inconsequential contribution to 2025 bookings and revenue. We expect to incur approximately $25 million in retention bonus payments paid to Base44 employees in 2025 as part of the above initial consideration paid on the transaction, which will be excluded from non-GAAP and free cash flow (FCF) results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties.

      "text": "The race to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) engineering agents that can rival \u2014 and even replace \u2014 human software engineers is accelerating.\nLast week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that by the end of the year, the company\u2019s most advanced AI reasoning model could rank first in competitive programming contests in the world.\nDuring a recent Q&A panel at the University of Tokyo, he said the first version of its reasoning model ranked one millionth among competitive programmers globally. Then it reached 10,000th place. OpenAI\u2019s latest and most powerful reasoning model \u2014 o3 \u2014 was able to reach 175th place.\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll hit no. 1 by the end of the year,\u201d Altman said. \u201cThat\u2019s like an amazing rate of scale for more compute in this new paradigm, and we don\u2019t see any signs of that stopping.\u201d\nFive days earlier, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said 2025 would be the year \u201cwhen it becomes possible to build an AI engineering agent that has coding and problem-solving abilities of around a good mid-level engineer.\u201d\nWhile Zuckerberg later clarified that this year would see groundwork for AI engineering agents with wide deployment coming in later years, he added that he believes \u201cthis is going to be a profound milestone and potentially one of the most important innovations in history.\u201d\nDevin the AI Engineering Agent\nCognition AI was ahead of the pack. In March, it introduced Devin, an AI software engineer agent capable of planning and executing complex engineering tasks, recalling context, learning over time and correcting itself.\nA team at Answer.AI tested Devin and found that \u201cthe results were sobering. Out of 20 tasks, we had 14 failures, 3 successes \u2026 and 3 inconclusive results. Tasks that seemed similar to our early successes would fail in unexpected ways.\u201d\nWhile AI will continue to get better, experts tell PYMNTS that there\u2019s more to the success of a software engineer than coding skills.\n\u201cSimply coding is not the primary value of a software engineer,\u201d Jim Olsen, CTO of ModelOp, told PYMNTS. \u201cActually figuring out what the desired solution and outcome is, and the nuances of design for providing a flexible solution that will stand the test of time\u201d are skills AI cannot replicate.\nSoftware engineers working in AI require the combined expertise of software development, programming, data science and data engineering, Olsen said. And while AI can potentially replace low-level engineers, the problem now becomes who to train for mid- to senior-level engineering positions that will still be needed, he added.\nIlya Smirnov, head of the AI/ML department at Usetech, holds a similar view. \u201cAI will not replace software developers anytime soon. Even with customization, specific use cases and wishful thinking, AI has too many limitations. Nevertheless, AI will change the way software engineers work.\u201d\nSmirnov noted that 70% of developers say they use AI-enabled development tools in their daily practice, which gives them an edge on tasks and increases productivity.\n\u201cAI for software development is already changing the way teams test, debug and document software. Developers are using AI to mediate communication with teammates, analysts, customers and clients,\u201d he told PYMNTS. \u201cIn particular, AI can speed up the addition of new features, bug fixes and support requests.\u201d\nSmirnov said developers use AI to write large amounts of code and generate test coverage of a particular piece of code. As such, AI accelerates development and makes it more continuous, he said.\nHowever, despite AI\u2019s strengths, developers are still needed because of complex coding requirements.\nSome projects impose often conflicting development requirements on developers that can\u2019t be met, Smirnov said. Solving these challenges requires communication between the product owner, project manager and client. In these situations, AI cannot help because it lacks precedents in its training and circumstances change dynamically.\nMoreover, AI cannot predict the development requirements of the organization, so the code created by the AI assistant may not meet the security and performance requirements of the company.\nSmirnov noted that AI works best in a narrowly defined domain.\n\u201cIt can create code that solves narrow, specific problems, but those solutions will not be well aligned with the entire product,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs a developer to stylistically and functionally harmonize all the software being developed.\u201d"

Today, AI-powered code generation tools like Replit and Cursor are making it possible even for non-technical people and those without experience with software engineering to create functional apps or websites.\nFor people who are not technical today ... I think that AI is just the biggest unlock. So we're going to have many more people who are going to be able to build apps.Sherry JiangCo-founder and CEO, Peek\nStartup founders aren't the only ones using it \u2014 Big Tech is also outsourcing some of its coding to AI. Last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that as much as 30% of the company's code is now written by artificial intelligence.\nI learned how to 'vibe code' in 2 days\nOne fine morning in April, I discovered a two-day \"vibe coding\" boot camp in my area which advertised that class takers could \"go from zero to one, creating functional apps in just 48 hours.\" That was my chance to get on the other side and see what the hype is all about.\nThe class, called \"Code with AI,\" took place in person in an office-turned-classroom over a single weekend. We were simply asked to bring our laptops and a project idea.\nI showed up about half an hour early on Saturday morning to get myself set up, which involved three simple steps:\n- Download and sign up for the free version of Cursor\n- Download NodeJS\n- Sign up for the free version of Vercel's v0\nThe boot camp, which costs $300 Singapore dollars (about $233), is run by Sherry Jiang, co-founder and CEO of fintech company Peek, and Agrim Singh, co-founder and CTO of AI-powered hardware design assistant Niyam AI. Both Jiang and Singh say that their own startups were largely built using the same AI tools and methods that they taught through the class.\nJust being able to write code is, I think, no longer going to be a huge differentiation in this current day and age. But if you are a really good software engineer, your productivity is just going to 10x.Sherry JiangCo-founder and CEO, Peek\nHere's an abridged version of how the weekend went.\nThe classes on both days began with a quick slideshow on what we'd be working on that day. On Saturday, we focused on narrowing down a project idea into a clearly defined product, then prototyping it. On Sunday, I worked on actually building out our product and integrating AI into them.\nI used Gemini 2.5 Pro, a large language model, to help clarify and narrow down my project idea into a clean product requirements document. I decided to create a negotiation training tool. From there, I used v0 to prototype and develop the user interface of the tool. Then, I used Cursor to build out my product and integrate AI into it.\nAll that may sound complicated or overwhelming to the unfamiliar, but the process was quite feasible in practice. Surprisingly, the most difficult part for me was picking an idea.\nI bounced between different options, ranging from an instant paperwork translator to a Tinder-for-dogs (to help match dogs for playdates). Ultimately, I settled on a web-based AI-powered negotiation trainer that helps teach users how to negotiate in different settings and situations, and with different personalities through written and spoken drills \u2014 which I successfully built out by the end of the weekend.\nIn hindsight, I realize I should have gone with the second option: Tinder-for-dogs.\nMajor takeaways\nI was amazed to find that the process did not involve coding at all. I learned that vibe coding is more about patience and prompt engineering \u2014 or knowing how to prompt or instruct the AI tools \u2014 than it is about coding.\nMuch of the class was about learning how to write out our prompts for the AI tools. \"AI is the dumbest smart thing out there ... you have to be super specific,\" Singh said to a class of about 30. As long as you can read, write and follow instructions, you can probably vibe code, I learned.\n\"Just being able to write code is, I think, no longer going to be a huge differentiation in this current day and age. But if you are a really good software engineer, your productivity is just going to 10x,\" said Jiang. As a result, startups may not need to raise as much money as hiring costs may also decrease, she added.\n\"For people who are not technical today ... I think that AI is just the biggest unlock. So we're going to have many more people who are going to be able to build apps,\" she said. Aspiring entrepreneurs who have felt held back by their lack of technical knowledge can now at least get a boost from AI.\nI see a ton of these people like making like, $10,000 to $20,000 a month off of a app they vibe coded, when they didn't know how code months ago.Sherry JiangCo-founder and CEO, Peek\nAI will be a great \"equalizer\" that will allow many more people to create companies, especially if they have an expertise in a specific area, Jiang added. For example, teachers can create an app for students, and diving instructors can create a global diving community app.\n\"I see a ton of these people making like, $10,000 to $20,000 a month off of an app they vibe coded, when they didn't know how to code months ago,\" said Jiang.\nWhile competition may also increase as more people can create startups today, Jiang predicts that it'll also be an opportunity to create niche apps that are hyper-focused on specific users.\nBut a question remains: do you need to know how to code in order to launch a solid product to the market today? Jiang says \"it depends what you build.\"\nIt's important to acknowledge the limitations of vibe coding, which is best suited to very simple, lightweight, straightforward consumer apps \u2014 not anything very technical that will require \"heavy enterprise security\" or anything of the like, Jiang noted.\nDo you want a new career that's higher-paying, more flexible or fulfilling?

      "text": "AI coding assistants are tools based on large language models to generate code, fix bugs and more. They enable smaller teams to do tasks that would cost a lot more and require additional engineers. They also cut development time for businesses to bring products to market faster.\n\u201cThe game has changed with the advent of AI coding tools, particularly for small firms,\u201d Lei Gao, CTO of social engagement platform SleekFlow, told PYMNTS. \u201cThey don\u2019t need an entire engineering team anymore because now they can save money and time too by developing apps, trying out new frameworks or automating procedures.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the experience of Mike Stone, co-founder of customer web and mobile development firm The Gnar Company, whose clients include the state of Massachusetts, Grubhub and AARP.\nStone described the old playbook as the following:\n- Hire five junior developers\n- Add two senior developers to mentor them\n- Hope they gel as a team.\n- Wait six months to a year for productivity gains\nWith AI coding tools, Stone said the playbook has changed to this:\n- Hire two exceptional senior developers\n- Equip them with AI tools\n- Watch them outperform entire teams\n- Ship product code from \u2018Day One.\u2019\n\u201cOne senior developer with the right toolchain now delivers what used to take a small team,\u201d Stone told PYMNTS.\nSmall businesses recognize the benefits of AI. According to a recent survey by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, nearly all (98%) small businesses are using an AI-enabled tool, and for good reason.\n\u201cAI allows small businesses \u2014 who many times do not have the staff or resources of their competitors \u2014 to punch above their weight,\u201d said Jordan Crenshaw, senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Technology Engagement Center, said in a blog post.\nThat data dovetails with PYMNTS Intelligence research, which shows 82% of enterprise CFOs surveyed either use AI in their accounts payable (AP) functions or are considering its adoption.\nPopular AI coding assistants include GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q Developer, Cursor, Windsurf, Tabnine, Replit Ghostwriter and others.\nParticularly salient is the latest trend called \u201cvibe coding,\u201d which is a new, more intuitive way for people to write computer code using natural language \u2014 like how one would talk to a friend.\nInstead of writing complex code in a particular syntax, users just need to describe what they want the software program to do, and an AI model helps turn that into working code. This speeds up the creative process and lets users focus more on ideas and less on technical details.\nGao said AI coding tools give small firms the potential to move quickly by eliminating monotonous tasks and providing code concepts.\n\u201cWe utilize AI on our platform at SleekFlow to enhance customer engagement for businesses with limited advanced technical resources,\u201d Gao said. \u201cFor small business players, it is doing more with less while maintaining quality and staying true to their vision.\u201d\nAI coding tools will get even better. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in April that the company plans to unveil AI that can do the work of a mid-level software engineer in 2025, with plans to scale the assistant next year.\nSee also: Apple and Anthropic Building AI-Powered Coding Platform\nUnderstand What AI Can and Can\u2019t Do\nHowever, Ilia Badeev, head of data science at the Trevolution Group, told PYMNTS that non-technical folks using AI coding tools can only go so far. \u201cIt is quite difficult to write a fully functional solution that will scale and continue to develop at the level of large tech companies without engineering skills or experience in industrial software development.\u201d\nDaniel Gorlovetsky, CEO at TLVTech, agreed. While solo founders and lean teams get prototypes off the ground faster, AI coding assistants \u201cdon\u2019t replace strong engineering,\u201d he told PYMNTS.\nHowever, they do \u201clower the barrier. You can go from idea to working MVP (minimum viable product) without hiring a full dev team,\u201d Gorlovetsky said. \u201cThat\u2019s massive for SMBs that can\u2019t afford $150,000+ engineers or a full-stack agency.\u201d\nStill, there\u2019s a trade-off. \u201cAI tools can get you 80% of the way, but if you don\u2019t know what \u2018good\u2019 looks like \u2014 clean architecture, security, scalability \u2014 you risk building something you\u2019ll have to throw away later.\u201d\nThe smart approach is to use AI to move fast and test ideas. Once it works, bring in \u201creal\u201d developers to lock it down, Gorlovetsky said.\nBut Santiago Nestares, co-founder of DualEntry, told PYMNTS that his company was able to build an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system like NetSuite despite being told that they would need at least $100 million, which was out of reach.\nAlso, \u201cwe don\u2019t have a 30-year CTO with a track record of enterprise architecture. We\u2019re a team of ambitious, technical people who lean heavily on AI tools to fill those gaps,\u201d Nestares said.\nThe company used ChatGPT daily to pressure-test its system designs, validate architectural decisions and explore edge (or one-off) cases. It used Cursor to write and refactor code with large language models (LLMs) embedded into its development workflow. It also used AI to help run automated code reviews and maintain quality without adding management layers or quality assurance processes.\n\u201cWith a team of just 11 people and nine months of focused work, we\u2019ve built a fully capable ERP that has feature parity with NetSuite,\u201d Nestares said. \u201cAI made that possible.\u201d\n\u201cIf we had to hire for all the knowledge we now get from AI, we\u2019d need a team two to three times the size,\u201d Nestares added. \u201cAI is the great equalizer. \u2026 For small businesses without the resources for a full tech org, AI coding tools aren\u2019t just helpful \u2014 they\u2019re transformational.\u201d\nRead more: Programming Proves to Be Profitable Application of GenAI Technology\nRead more: Report: OpenAI in Talks to Acquire AI-Powered Coding Tool Windsurf\nRead more: AI Software Tools Could Streamline and Personalize the Commerce Experience"

      "text": "There\u2019s a lot of talk in the startup world about how AI makes individuals so productive that it could give rise to a generation of \u201csolo unicorns\u201d \u2014 one-person companies worth over $1 billion.\nWhile an actual solo unicorn remains a mythical creature, Israeli developer Maor Shlomo provided compelling evidence Wednesday that the concept might not be impossible.\nShlomo sold his 6-month-old, bootstrapped vibe-coding startup Base44 to Wix for $80 million, Wix announced Wednesday. And the deal was cash, Wix confirmed to TechCrunch.\nAdmittedly, this wasn\u2019t a billion dollars or close to it. And Shlomo wasn\u2019t truly solo \u2014 he had eight employees, Wix confirmed. They will collectively receive $25 million of the $80 million as a \u201cretention\u201d bonus. Wix declined to give details on that part of the deal, like how long they have to stay in their jobs to get full payouts.\nStill, Base44\u2019s rapid rise and impressive sale price have been the talk of the vibe-coding community.\nIn its six months as a stand-alone company, Base44 reportedly grew to 250,000 users, hitting 10,000 users within its first three weeks. According to Shlomo\u2019s posts on X and LinkedIn, the company was profitable, generating $189,000 in profit in May even after covering high LLM token costs, which he also documented publicly.\nBase44 spread mostly through word of mouth as Shlomo, a 31-year-old programmer, shared his building journey on LinkedIn and Twitter. The project began as a side venture, he told Israeli tech news site CTech.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\n\u201cBase44 is a moonshot experiment \u2014 helping everyone, technical or not, build software without coding at all,\u201d he explained on LinkedIn when he launched it to the public.\nIt\u2019s one of the newer crop of vibe-coding products designed for non-programmers. Users enter text prompts, and the platform builds complete applications, with database, storage, authentication, analytics, and integration. It also supports email, texting, and maps, with a roadmap for more enterprise-grade security support.\nBase44 isn\u2019t unique in this area. Other vibe coders like Adaptive Computer handle similar infrastructure work. But Base44\u2019s fast rise was astounding all the same.\nShlomo was already known in the Israeli startup community through his previous startup, the Insight Partners-backed data analytics company Explorium. His brother is also a co-founder of an AI security startup, Token Security, which just raised $20 million led by Notable Capital (formerly GGV Capital) and a bunch of Israeli tech angels.\nHe quickly gained partnership agreements for Base44 with big Israeli tech companies like eToro and Similarweb.\nAfter posting about his decision to use Anthropic\u2019s Claude LLM through AWS instead of models by OpenAI \u2014 mostly for cost-per-performance reasons \u2014 Amazon invited Base44 to demo at a Tel Aviv AWS event last month, which Shlomo documented.\n\u201cCrazy f***ing journey so far,\u201d Shlomo posted on LinkedIn when announcing the news of the acquisition. Despite the growth and the profits \u2014 or really because of it \u2014 he sold his still-bootstrapped company because \u201cthe scale and volume we need is not something we can organically grow into \u2026 If we were able to get so far organically, bootstrapped, I\u2019m excited to see our new pace now that we have all the resources in place,\u201d he wrote.\nFor its part, Wix picked up a proven, fast-growing, local vibe-coding platform for a relative song because of its youth. OpenAI paid $3 billion for Windsurf, which was founded in 2021.\nWix, of course, offers no-code website building that look professionally designed. Adding a profitable LLM vibe-coding product to its offerings is a logical move.\nShlomo could not be immediately reached for additional comment."

      "text": "Computer Science > Software Engineering\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Vibe Coding as a Reconfiguration of Intent Mediation in Software Development: Definition, Implications, and Research Agenda\nView PDFAbstract:Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the software development process away from traditional areas such as design or technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-, technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future investigations of this paradigm.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.SE\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

      "text": "In early January, 18\u2011year\u2011old Justin Jin launched Giggles \u2014 an AI-powered social entertainment app that\u2019s reportedly attracted over 120,000 waitlist sign-ups and generated 150 million impressions \u2014 all without a venture capital war chest, a marketing budget, or a traditional engineering team. Instead, he and his team of young co-founders leveraged AI to build an app for Gen Alpha and Gen Z, where users interact through AI-generated content, digital collectibles and gamified social engagements.\nA few weeks later, another startup arrived on the scene \u2014 Base44, founded by a non-technical creator who used AI to \u201cvibe code\u201d a no-code development platform. Within six months and under ten people, it reached profitability, pulled in 300,000 users and sold to Wix for $80 million in cash, according to TechCrunch. Suddenly, a new archetype emerged: Companies not founded on traditional engineering teams, but shaped by creativity, culture and AI orchestration.\nThis is the story of the moment. AI is redefining entrepreneurship, allowing people with a vision and cultural understanding \u2014 but not necessarily computer-science degrees \u2014 to ship platform-level products. But questions are mounting: Can this new model of entrepreneurship scale beyond prototype success without deeper engineering muscle?\nThe Rise Of Vibe Coding\nTwo years ago, the phrase \u201cvibe coding\u201d barely existed. Today, it\u2019s everywhere. The term \u2014 coined by Andrej Karpathy, former AI lead at Tesla and cofounder of OpenAI \u2014 describes writing with AI by simply speaking ideas. \u201cYou fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials and forget that the code even exists,\u201d Karpathy tweeted in February. It\u2019s shorthand for a new era, where programming is done through a natural language like English.\nAccording to Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator, many startups now use AI to generate up to 95% of their codebase \u2014 achieving results that once required teams of 50 to 100 engineers with fewer than ten people. Meanwhile, in a recent article for Business Insider, Alistair Barr highlighted how \u201cnon\u2011traditional, AI\u2011native developers\u201d are turning natural language into apps, fundamentally altering SaaS economics.\nThis shift is democratizing entrepreneurship. Product managers, artists, even high-schoolers can now ship products faster than ever before, all without technical expertise. But it also comes with some problems. As Nigel Douglas, head of developer relations at Cloudsmith, cautioned in the Financial Times, \u201cIf you\u2019re creating an app in your spare time, a \u201cDIY disaster\u201d might just mean an ugly interface. But in a business setting, the wrong tool can do real damage and result in data breaches, service outages, or a compromised software supply chain.\u201d\nGitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke echoed this warning at the just-concluded VivaTech in Paris: \u201cA non\u2011technical founder will find it difficult to build a startup at scale without developers,\u201d adding that tools like vibe coding don\u2019t provide the depth needed to justify serious investment. Even AI-native founders acknowledge the model\u2019s limitations.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need to build technical depth. We know that\u2019s important and are expanding engineering operations and bringing on advisors,\u201d said Edwin Wang, co-founder of Giggles. \u201cThe future, however, must be a community-governed and decentralized future where there\u2019s a balance between creativity and coding.\u201d\nWhen Creativity Replaces Code: The Giggles Test Case\nGiggles is a microcosm of this transformation. Jin, alongside co-founders Edwin Wang and music artist Matthew Hershoff, built a system where users are rewarded for digital expression through game-like interactions \u2014 including AI-generated videos, collectible content, and daily quests. The result was a storytelling-centric platform developed without a traditional coding team \u2014 a structure that reflects the emerging blueprint behind many Gen Z\u2013led apps.\nJin previously founded Mediababy, which sold for $3.8 million, according to Reuters. That experience, he said, shaped his belief that platforms thrive when they prioritize user expression and fluid engagement over rigid structure.\nAt Giggles, that belief translated into a product anchored in prompt-driven creativity, gamified feedback loops, and community-led interaction. As Wang noted, the company positions itself not just as an alternative to TikTok, but as a platform tailored for a generation it believes is increasingly disengaged from traditional social formats. And according to Hershoff, \u201ccreators aren\u2019t limited to just posting photos and videos. They can vibe code a game, develop an app, create a whole virtual world and post it on Giggles.\u201d\nCan AI-First Startups Scale?\nFor all the momentum behind AI-native startups, there\u2019s a hard truth facing founders like Jin: culture can spark attention, but infrastructure sustains it. Platforms like Giggles, which thrive on virality and creator energy, eventually confront the same foundational question as any company with ambition. Can they scale securely, reliably, repeatedly and with technical discipline?\nAt this stage, Giggles is less an anomaly and more a litmus test for how AI is transforming digital entrepreneurship. It\u2019s a living experiment in what happens when creativity, not technical expertise, drives product development. But to evolve from prompt-powered outfits into structured business ecosystems, these companies will need more than just vibes. They will need systems, safeguards and engineering depth.\nThat\u2019s where founders must reckon with the limits of what vibe coding can achieve. Dohmke\u2019s warning at VivaTech isn\u2019t a dismissal of AI\u2019s potential, but a reminder of where the handoff happens. While AI can accelerate the zero-to-one moment, scaling responsibly requires the engineering rigor to turn a clever idea into a truly dependable platform.\nJin and his team appear to recognize that. While Giggles was built without a traditional engineering stack, the company is now investing in its technical foundation. Wang, the platform\u2019s co-founder and lead developer, acknowledges that \u201cscaling creativity still requires coding discipline.\u201d That doesn\u2019t diminish their AI-first origin; it refines it.\nThe next test for Giggles \u2014 and others like it \u2014 isn\u2019t whether AI can launch a product. It\u2019s whether that product can become the infrastructure others depend on.\nA Hybrid Future For Founders\nWhat might the next decade yield? The trends point at a wave of hybrid founders: People with vivid creative vision and AI fluency who bring in veteran operators and engineers to solidify their product. That\u2019s the emerging blueprint: rapid prototyping, followed by structural discipline.\nIndustry stalwart Reid Hoffman sees that promise, noting that \u201cbringing AI into your toolkit makes you enormously attractive.\u201d But he and others caution that early AI advantage doesn\u2019t equal long-term lead. As AI-generated code gets better, so too must practices around testing, review, and security.\nIn the end, the rise of vibe coding is real, but it\u2019s only half the story. Architecture, execution and human judgment are what matters most. While Giggles, Base44 and the rising \u201cAI-native\u201d wave might be writing the prologue, the plot turns on whether these founders can turn vibe into real structure.\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d Jin told me, \u201cit\u2019s not just about who can build fast. It\u2019s about who can build something that lasts.\u201d"

      "text": "\u201cThis is not just augmenting the current software engineers in your workforce, which is kind of what we can do today through Copilot, but instead, it\u2019s literally an agentic software engineer that can build an app for you,\u201d Friar said at the Disruptive Technology Symposium in London.\n\u201cNot only does it build it, it does all the things that software engineers hate to do\u201d such as quality assurance tests, bug testing and bashing, as well as the accompanying documentation, she said. \u201cSo suddenly, you can force multiply your software engineering workforce.\u201d\nThis agentic software engineer is called \u201cA-SWE\u201d and represents the third phase of OpenAI\u2019s development of agentic AI \u2014 systems that work independently on behalf of users.\nLast year, Cognition AI was the first to release an AI software engineer. Devin could plan and execute complex engineering tasks, and it can use common developer tools within a gated environment, \u201ceverything a human would need to do their work,\u201d the startup said.\nOpenAI\u2019s A-SWE is its third agentic tool, with the first two being Deep Research, which creates comprehensive research reports, and Operator, which performs web-based tasks like booking travel or making dinner reservations, according to Friar.\nThe next phase of AI agents would extend human knowledge to create something truly novel the world hasn\u2019t seen yet.\nFriar said academics are telling OpenAI that AI models are \u201ccoming up with novel things in their field. They don\u2019t yet know if those novel things are real, because they now need to go and test\u201d and see if it\u2019s a new discovery.\nFriar also revealed that GPT-4.5, OpenAI\u2019s most advanced GPT model, was trained to have more EQ \u2014 emotional quotient or intelligence \u2014 not just technical skills.\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually spending a bunch of time thinking about the more EQ side of models,\u201d Friar said. \u201cWe spent a lot more time training (GPT-4.5) to have what Silicon Valley loves to call vibes, but effectively EQ.\u201d\nShe described the model as feeling \u201cvery human\u201d and \u201cactually better for things like design or writing or creative concepts, rather than just pure hard math and science.\u201d\nWhile overall viewing AI coworkers as a good thing, human workers remain cautious. A January PYMNTS Intelligence report, \u201cGenAI: A Generational Look at AI Usage and Attitudes,\u201d shows more than half of survey respondents think AI poses a \u201csignificant risk\u201d of widespread job displacement.\nRead more: SoftBank Reportedly Aims to Borrow $16 Billion for AI \u2018Stargate\u2019\nOpenAI\u2019s Vertical Growth Path\nFriar, who previously held leadership roles at Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, Salesforce and Square, said OpenAI is moving beyond being solely a model builder to becoming a comprehensive AI infrastructure provider and applications developer.\n\u201cToday, OpenAI is so much more,\u201d Friar said. \u201cWe\u2019re going down into data center technology \u2026 and we feel like we\u2019re creating a lot of IP there, and it\u2019s really important for us to own that.\u201d\nIn January, OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX announced the $500 billion Stargate project to build data centers specially for AI training and inference. Initial tech partners are Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle and OpenAI.\nFriar compared OpenAI\u2019s infrastructure investment to Amazon\u2019s strategic decision to develop AWS rather than outsourcing cloud computing to competitors.\n\u201cThink about Amazon, at that moment where they\u2019re rocking it on eCommerce, they see AWS starting to take shape. If at that stage they decided to go outsource to the upstart Google or something, giving all that IP of AWS away, think about how different the company would be today,\u201d she said.\nDespite OpenAI\u2019s technological breakthroughs, Friar acknowledged that computing limitations remain its biggest constraint. Stargate is designed to ensure the startup will always have enough computing power.\nIt was lack of computing power that delayed OpenAI\u2019s models in the past, Friar said.\nFor example, the release of OpenAI\u2019s video generation model Sora was delayed by nearly a year because the company didn\u2019t have enough computing power to handle user requests.\nStargate is expected to help solve the problem of inadequate computing power. It should yield 10 gigawatts, which would exceed the entire electrical consumption of Ireland (seven gigawatts).\nSuch investments are critical since OpenAI is growing fast. Friar said OpenAI has tripled its revenue each year for three consecutive years, with 400 million weekly active users currently on its platform.\nLooking ahead, Friar indicated that while an IPO isn\u2019t imminent given the startup\u2019s development and expansion plans, it remains a future possibility.\n\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine that right now \u2014 so much going on,\u201d she said. At some point it will be considered since \u201cbeing a public company is good hygiene.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "Vibe coding, a term coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, allows users to create software applications using plain language instead of traditional programming skills, significantly reducing development time and costs. This approach democratizes app creation, enabling non-technical founders to rapidly prototype and launch products, as exemplified by the success of startups like Base44, which was acquired by Wix for $80 million within six months of its launch. However, while vibe coding facilitates innovation, it also presents risks related to security, compliance, and the quality of AI-generated code, necessitating careful oversight by experienced developers for high-stakes applications.",
