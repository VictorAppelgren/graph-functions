      "feedback": "The current draft is too unstructured for a world‑class 0–3 week read: it restates the incident with minimal causal logic, treats “market impact” as a vague afterthought, and does not spell explicit catalysts, thresholds, or invalidation points. Actionable edits: build a tight 5‑part causal chain (incident → immediate disruption and evac near Lubyanka/FSB HQ → authorities’ investigation and official casualty framing → evolving narrative in state media versus other channels → potential security posture shifts and risk sentiment effects). For catalysts and triggers, explicitly list: casualty toll updates (e.g., escalation from “at least one dead” to 2+ dead or 3+ injured), official cause framing (accident vs. foul play; any reversals or clarifications), and investigation milestones (police findings, forensic results, security advisories). Define monitoring thresholds: if fatalities rise above 1 or if the cause remains uncertain after 24–48 hours, expect stronger risk signals; if the investigation confirms an isolated accident with no security risk and no areaSecurity changes, odds of material short‑term market impact stay low. Quantify clearly: anchor to “at least one killed” and “injured” as reported, but present plausible ranges (dead: 1–2; injured: few to several) with confidence notes and label Mash Telegram reporting as unverified while noting it as a detail that could influence narrative if corroborated. Strengthen the 0–3 week reaction function: articulate plausible asset‑level implications (local risk premium on Russian assets if security rhetoric intensifies; otherwise negligible macro impact) and specify the exact data you’d watch (casualty totals, official statements, security posture changes, evacuations extending beyond the immediate venue). Maintain strict reliance on NBX9RA9WX, and explicitly flag any non‑confirmed elements (e.g., Mash’s claim) as provisional; ensure the write‑up keeps the proximity to the FSB HQ as a narrative emphasis but avoids overstating implications without evidence.",
