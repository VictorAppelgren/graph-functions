      "feedback": "**Feedback & Action Items**\n\n1. **Canonical Mapping** – Explicitly tie the thesis to the handle `ust10y` (e.g., “UST 10‑year yield (ust10y) is expected to decline 10–20 bp”).  \n2. **Magnitude & Sign** – State the sign and range in one line: “UST 10‑year yield likely falls 10–20 bp over 0–3 weeks.”  \n3. **Catalyst Window** – Keep the core PCE release (Aug 29) and the tariff ruling (Aug 29) as the two dated catalysts; add a third “Fed September policy meeting (Sept 16‑17)” as a near‑term trigger.  \n4. **Remove Peripheral Detail** – Delete the paragraph on Lisa Cook’s removal; it adds no direct, time‑bound impact on the 10‑year curve.  \n5. **Causal Chain** – Tighten the narrative:  \n   - Core PCE 2.6 % → 85 % chance of 25‑bp cut → 10‑year falls 10–20 bp.  \n   - Tariff ruling removes supply‑side inflation → supports yield decline.  \n   - Any tariff expansion or core PCE > 2.8 % → cuts probability, yields tighten 5–10 bp.  \n6. **Invalidation & Monitoring** – Add a clear “invalidation” clause: “If next core PCE > 2.8 % or new tariffs are announced, the 10‑year could rise 5–15 bp.”  \n7. **Conciseness** – Trim redundant phrases (“Fed’s own signals—particularly Chair Powell’s dovish remarks…”) to keep the paragraph under 150 words.  \n\nImplement these edits to meet the 0–3 week horizon, provide a defensible, quantified view, and maintain strict focus on `ust10y`.",
