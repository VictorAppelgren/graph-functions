  "title": "What Kind Of Car Did Jesse Drive In The Fast And The Furious?",
  "description": "Jesse is a short-lived character from the Fast and the Furious franchise who drove a pretty iconic car, but the history is a little complicated.",
  "content": "What Kind Of Car Did Jesse Drive In The Fast And The Furious?\n\nThe Fast and Furious saga is well-known for a lot of things: the distinctive cast including the late Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, the over-the-top action set-pieces, the exotic locations \u2014 but most of all, it's known for the cars. First releasing in 2001, this series likely played a tremendous role in kick-starting the tuner craze of the mid-2000s. Of course, that's due to a litany of amazing recurring vehicles; we're not discussing those, nor are we talking about the worst cars ever featured in the Fast and Furious franchise. Rather, we're addressing a distinctive car owned by a prominent support character in the first movie: Jesse's white Jetta. More specifically, Jesse's white 1995 Volkswagen Jetta Mk3 \u2014 this machine didn't particularly stand out from a mechanical perspective, but that Wings West body kit and white with blue decals granted it an iconic image nonetheless. In the movie, Jesse himself was more of a nerdy technician than an outright racer, servicing deuteragonist Dom Toretto's crew's rides for street racing and heists. As a quick refresher, the Jetta was only raced once: a pink-slip race (winner takes the loser's car), which Jesse lost against antagonist Tran. The car is only glimpsed in one additional scene later in the movie: when Jesse is killed during a drive-by shooting by Tran and his cousin, never to be seen again in any sequel. But what happened to the real thing, and was it actually any fast, or just a movie gimmick? Let's pop the hood.\n\nSadly we never get much in-universe information on this vehicle, unlike Dom's charger with its iconic blower sticking out of the hood. Originally it was never meant to even be a Jetta; in fact, Jesse was supposed to drive either an E36 BMW M3 or an Audi A4 or S4, but it ultimately wound up being a 1995 Jetta through a twist of fate; more on that later. Much like other movie cars, Jesse ends up with one of three identical vehicles in the movie: the \"Hero\" car and two action cars. But that's only the Jetta \u2014 Jesse also likely drove at least one Honda Civic; it may be presumed that he's riding with, if not driving, one of the Civics at the start of the movie \u2014 the black ones with green neon underglow, though the crew were wearing masks at the time. More prominently, however, was the \"Jetta\" he drove in the pivotal pink-slip race which was actually just a Civic made up to superficially resemble his car. If you look closely at the interior, you'll see the distinct silhouette of a mid-90s Civic that's been converted to a shell for filming. The other notorious hiccup in the movie that we noticed was the lack of front brake calipers on the Jetta during the race scene; this was actually a trick used to fill dead space inside of the 19-inch wheel. Back in 1999, almost no cars had such large rims, owing to tires not being available in that size, according to the Jetta's actual owner. So, the team filled the space with a dummy brake rotor, whereas behind it sat a custom $9,000 Brembo 4-piston disc brake setup.\n\nThe Jetta was originally owned by Scott Centra, proprietor of Wings West \u2014 the company responsible for many of the iconic body kits featured on some of the series' flashiest cars. The real-life Jetta boasts a 2.0 inline-four with the 4-speed automatic, albeit packing a cool six figures' worth of goodies inside. In fact, the car itself was valued at around $200,000 all-in for the insurance quote, should it have gotten written-off during the movie's production. Naturally that includes far more than just the price of an automatic four-banger Jetta; Scott Centra poured a mountain of time and effort into heavily-customizing this vehicle with all sorts of technology and bespoke details, from the Plexiglas window showing off the nitrous to the PS2 in the glove compartment. As for the graphics, those were all done by Universal Studios. The original car was white with red and black stripes. After the filming of the original Fast and the Furious concluded, Scott Centra, a movie industry veteran himself, spoke with actor Frankie Muniz who expressed an interest in the Jetta. Going off the success of Malcolm in the Middle, Muniz purchased the car from Centra after it failed to sell on its own at auction, and it became Muniz's first vehicle. He owned the Jetta all the way beyond January 2016, when the car was put up for auction at Barrett-Jackson and it again failed to sell. Some time after, he was finally able to sell the car to the company Luxury Auto Collection, and it's privately changed hands ever since.",

      "text": "5 Of The Flashiest Cars In The Fast & Furious That We'd Most Like To Own\nThe \"Fast & Furious\" series has no shortage of unique vehicles. But some are more grounded in reality than others. The series started with souped-up cars that, often through the power of NOS, reached seemingly incredible speeds. Not only were they fast, but they were also designed to make a statement.\nTake Bow-Wow's green 2005 Volkswagen Touran Hulk car from \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,\" which had a massive Hulk graphic on the front and fist dent marks on its sides. Although unique, unless you are a die-hard Hulk fan, it's doubtful you'd want that one parked in your garage.\nThe series eventually strayed from reality, becoming more about big heists and massive stunts. As the plot got out of the world, so did the cars. For this list, we will focus on vehicles you could own, as unless you are someone like Elon Musk, you won't be owning a space car any time soon. Here are five cars from the series we'd love to cruise around in.\n1997 Mazda RX-7 FD\nThe 1997 Mazda RX-7 FD is the real star of \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,\" and even went on to become an icon of its own because of it. The flashy car gets its unique look from its House of Kolor black and orange color combination and its Veilside Fortune Bodykit. The RX-7 is an exceptional car for drifting with its rotary engine, compact size, and well-balanced chassis.\nSo, it's no wonder it is Han Seoul-Oh's car of choice in a movie about drifting. The protagonist, Sean Boswell, also takes a spin in the vehicle on multiple occasions. But one of the most memorable scenes with the RX-7 is when the two drift around two Japanese women sitting in a stationary car in an attempt to get their phone numbers.\nThe car, like the character Han, meets an unfortunate end in the movie. During an adrenaline-pumping escape from antagonists Takashi and Morimoto, Han T-bones a vehicle at high speeds. This resulted in an explosion that seemingly killed Han. As \"Fast & Furious\" fans may already know, this was eventually retconned in the later movies, as Han resurfaces in \"F9.\" The custom RX-7, however, wasn't as lucky.\n1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34\nBrian O'Conner's 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 is one of the most iconic vehicles in the series. It featured a powerful 2.6-liter RB26DETT twin-turbo inline-six, making it one of the fastest cars on the block. The GT-R's notable style came from its Sunline Racing body kit, its House of Kolor Platinum Pearl paint job with blue stripes and decals throughout, and that iconic neon blue under glow that was rampant in street cars in that era.\nDespite being so beloved, the vehicle appears only briefly in the second movie. Brian famously rolls up in the GT-R to participate in a street race hosted by Tej Parker, played by Ludacris, at the beginning of \"2 Fast 2 Furious.\" After an intense back and forth between himself, Suki, and a few other drivers, Brian spectacularly wins the race by jumping across a bridge. But his victory was short-lived after the cops showed up, and ESD harpooned the car.\nWhat casual viewers might not know is that the car is actually in a six-minute special video called \"Turbo-Charged Prelude.\" This video bridges the gap between the first and second films. Not everyone has seen it because it was only available on the Tricked-Out Edition of the DVD release. In the video, he buys the car in cash from a used car dealership while on the run from the authorities. He then tunes it and drives it to Miami, where the second movie starts.\n1994 Toyota Supra MK 4\nDriven by our protagonist Brian O'Conner in the movie that started it all, this Supra became arguably the most recognizable car from the entire series. The car debuts as a rusted pile of junk before Brian and Dominic Toretto restore it. With the restoration came some impressive modifications.\nThese upgrades include a twin-turbo 2JZ-GTE 3.0-liter inline-six and a four-speed automatic transmission that pumps out an impressive 550 horsepower in conjunction with a 100 HP nitrous oxide wet system. Some other modifications include a TRD-style hood, an APR aluminum biplane rear wing, and a Bomex front spoiler and side skirts. The exterior of the car is distinct with its Lamborghini Diablo Candy Orange pearl paint and its Nuclear Gladiator decal, green and grey decals on the sides of the car designed by the famous Troy Lee.\nAfter getting built up, it handily beats a 1995 Ferrari F355 Spider in an impromptu drag race. What makes this vehicle iconic is its role in one of the most famous scenes in the series. In it, Brian and Dom race down a city street before flying past an oncoming train, narrowly missing a collision. The race gets cut short when Dominic crashes, totaling his Dodge 1970 Dodge Charger R/T. As a sign of faith, Brian hands Dom the keys to the Supra and tells him to drive off to avoid the police.\nThe real-life vehicle was later repurposed as Slap Jack's gold 1993 Supra in the sequel. But it was eventually reverted and put up for auction for an eye-watering amount of money.\n2000 Honda S2000\nOne of the most stylish cars in the series is Suki's 2000 Honda S2000 from \"2 Fast 2 Furious.\" The hot pink beauty featured a two-liter aluminum-alloy DOHC F20C1 inline-four with a Comptech supercharger, a VeilSide Millennium body kit, and, of course, some bottles of NOS. Suki races this car against Bryan at the beginning of the movie. The very race in which Bryan showed off his 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34. During the race, the car gets seriously dinged up. But it was still in good enough condition to speed away once the race got raided by the feds.\nThe vehicle still survives and is housed at the Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. This Honda's unique look made it a character itself, making multiple appearances outside of the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise. For example, it can be spotted in music videos such as Pink's \"Stupid Girls,\" Lindsay Lohan's \"First,\" and Ludacris's \"Act a Fool.\" It also makes an appearance in the movie \"Bring It On: Fight to the Finish.\"\n1970 Dodge Charger R/T\nA staple of the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise is Dominic Toretto's 1970 Dodge Charger R/T, which is always found parked inside the garage at the Toretto house. As Dom tells it, the muscle car was built by him and his father when he was younger. Once it was roadworthy, his father broke the quarter mile record time at the Los Angeles County Raceway in nine seconds flat. It's easy to see how that was possible as the rear-wheel drive car had 900 horsepower on the hood with its eye-catching BDS 8-71 Roots-style supercharger. However, the Charger doesn't survive the first film, as Dom flips it after slamming into a semi-truck before abandoning it in the movie's final scene.\nBut Dom's love for the vehicle lived on, as he'd find replacements anytime his beloved got destroyed. The film crew even created a mold of the car to make it easier to bring back in subsequent films. In \"Fast Five,\" the vehicle returns with a lower suspension and a supercharger positioned inside the hood instead of on it. Dom's Charger in \"Furious 7\" gets the most modifications to turn it into an offroad machine with military Jeep parts and a roof-mounted grappling hook. But we'll take the one featured in the first film, as it is at least a smidge more practical."

      "text": "5 Of The Worst Cars In The Fast & Furious Franchise\nWhat started out as a movie about cars and family has rapidly became a franchise with over-the-top car stunts, with all types of vehicles driving backward, driving in space, and surviving massive falls. Still, fans can't help but be entertained by the wild antics of Dom and his crew as they race in narrow parking garages, drag safes down city streets, and drive cars into helicopters in the sky, jumping onto moving vehicles unscathed all along the way.\nWhat has kept the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise popular, aside from the increasingly unrealistic adventures, are the cars. I've seen all of the \"Fast & Furious\" movies (for better or worse) and some vehicles were definitely the most iconic. Over 1,400 cars have been destroyed throughout the movie series, some more heartbreaking than others. In this list, we will be looking at the cars we wouldn't mind tossing off a cliff ourselves.\nThese cars were selected due to their underwhelming performance, inaccuracy relating to the car's real-life capabilities, and barf-worthy makeovers. While they may have some fans, we are not among them. More on our methodology at the end of this story.\nWarning: Some stunts and storylines from throughout the series are shared in this article, so reverse back at 100 miles per hour if you plan on binging these films.\n2005 Volkswagen Touran: The hideous Hulk\nFinding somebody who likes this car is probably more difficult than swinging your car from a rope off the side of a cliff. Driven by Twinkie (played by rapper Lil' Bow Wow) in 2006's \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,\" this car is on the list due to its heinous design alone. The minivan itself is fine, although it's nothing too special, but that distractingly hideous makeover is enough to make drifting seem lame. The Hulk's face is painted on the hood, there's fake hair on the roof, and the sides feature 3D fists as if Hulk is trying to break out the vehicle (we wouldn't blame him for wanting to get out).\nDirector Justin Lin created this upsetting design because he's a fan of the old \"The Incredible Hulk\" TV show. This is proof that not every interest belongs on a car \u2014 it's up there with hentai decals when it comes to repelling the public. There's a reason Sean (Lucas Black) looks miserable during the scene where the car is introduced.\n1950 Chevrolet Fleetline: Flaming garbage\nThis car made it on the list because it just about ruined one of the best scenes in 2017's \"The Fate of the Furious.\" Dom (Vin Diesel) wins a race in Cuba, which is nothing too crazy. But he wins it while driving an old junker car in reverse and also happens to save people in the process. Sound more \"Fast and Furious\"-like to you? In this scene, Dom is driving a 1950 Chevrolet Fleetline, which isn't all too impressive of a vehicle \u2014 unless you are making it an awesome lowrider. In real life, it takes 20 seconds to reach 60 mph and its top speed isn't even that much more, at 75 mph. That's nowhere near the 100 mph Dom reaches \u2014 while going backward \u2014 in this race.\nIn an attempt to make this more realistic, the car was given a turbocharger, but it's clearly fake (and they even pretend to jury-rig it in the film). That means Dom was driving a car with just 85 horsepower.\nThe 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GTS: A drag to watch\nFirst of all, who is drag racing in a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GTS? It's almost like the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise gave up on any realism after the first film and decided to try to convince audiences any old car could race through a rocky field as rockets are launched at it or take on top supercars in international drag races. This underwhelming car was featured in \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" in 2003, rolling up to the drag race with a 3.0L V6 engine, 210 hp, and front-wheel drive \u2014 and a top speed of 130 mph (drag cars are on record going up to 338 mph).\nTo make things even worse, Roman Pearce (actor Tyrese Gibson) tried to mask the car's lameness with over-the-top styling. The checkerboard paint pattern on the hood? The tacky stripes on the side panels? The over-the-top rear spoiler? According to Celebrity Car Museum, these were all chosen by Gibson himself. This man should be banned from even picking out a paper towel holder.\n1999 Nissan Maxima: Mom van gone mad\nThe 1999 Nissan Maxima has no business being a star car in any \"Fast & Furious\" film, especially the first one. Fans have drawn comparisons between the members of Toretto's OG crew and the cars they drive since the first film came out in 2001. So why was Vince (Matt Schulze) driving this unimpressive suburban sedan?\nDespite an attempt at disguising the car with an obnoxious shark-on-fire design down the side and an irritating muffler, car enthusiasts can still tell that the Maxima is lame. You'll reach zero to 60 in 6.9 seconds and top out at 144 mph thanks to its V6 engine producing 190 horsepower. This may be fine for having some fun on the highway, but chasing bad guys to save the world?\nApparently, the Nissan Maxima was not chosen due to its actual specs (which makes sense). Schulze ended up in the car due to convenience. The film's technical director, Craig Lieberman, brought his modified Maxima to the set and for some reason, nobody questioned it. It had a supercharger kit that boosted the hp to 260, which was enough for \"Fast & Furious\" honchos to green-light it.\n2010 BMW M5 replicas: We were glad when they exploded\nDominic's entire crew was supplied with BMW E60 M5s in 2013's \"Fast & Furious 6.\" The cars are used in a sort of undercover heist that results in a chase involving the cringy flip car. The chases in this movie aren't quite what a car enthusiast would want \u2014 instead of showing the car's capabilities on the streets, they're more just shoving each other around. But the cars are destroyed one by one, anyway, with the use of a microchip that disables them. If this sounds more like a goofy secret-agent movie than a car-racing movie, that's because it is.\nEven worse, however, is that the BMWs are actually replicas. The crew didn't even try to make them look authentic, failing to use an M5 body kit. And in the film, Hobbs describes them as \"twin turbo V8s,\" but the M5 should have a twin turbocharged V10.\nHow we chose these cars\nThe \"Fast & Furious\" films have grown increasingly insane as time goes on, and some fans love seeing cars float in space while others miss seeing car chases with, well, driving. Opinions on the cars within the franchise are all subjective, too. What may be an atrocious green monstrosity to some may be a masterpiece to others \u2014 in fact, there are plenty of Hulk Touran fans.\nSo how did we pick these as the worst cars? The selections were based on my own feelings while watching the movies as well as lists, forums, and discussions with other fans of the series. There were plenty of bad cars to choose from, but I felt some reviews were a bit harsh. For example, one list claimed the 2014 Maserati Ghibli from 2015's \"Furious 7\" was worthy of being called one of the worst simply for being expensive to fix and having a hideous interior \u2014 which can barely be seen in the film. Another contender was the Chevrolet Caprice from the same film, but with some research I found that the Caprice performed better on the track than the critic had claimed.\nFor me, the cars discussed here had a balanced blend of lame performances and ugly designs, making them some of the series' worst. If you want to see some of SlashGear's favorites, though, check out this list of flashy \"Fast & Furious\" cars we'd most like to own."

      "text": "What Is The Piece That Sticks Out Of Dom's 1970 Charger R/T Hood In Fast & Furious?\nWhile the Fast & Furious series is full of souped-up Japanese Domestic Market cars with bright graphics, Dom (played by Vin Diesel) at one point drives something right out of the classic muscle car era. The black 1970 Charger R/T is hard to forget once it appears on screen, especially considering the massive scoop protruding out of the hood. It was an Enderle Buzzard Catcher scoop and part of a root's supercharger. When comparing twin screw vs roots vs centrifugal superchargers, each one accomplishes the same task, with unique pros and cons. A supercharger forces more air into the engine and increases performance output. One of the eye-catching elements of the scoop on Dom's Charger is the butterfly valve design, which opens and closes with throttle use.\nAccording to a YouTube video by Craig Lieberman, a senior producer on the movie, in the scene where audiences get a look under the hood, the filmmakers borrowed a Chuck Taylor Racing engine for that one scene and then returned it. That engine was built using a late '50s 392 Hemi that was modified into 445 cubic inches and included a Mooneyham 6-71 supercharger. It was even revealed that during the driving scenes, what audiences are hearing from Dom's muscle car is actually a completely different V8 Hemi engine than the one shown in the movie. This is relevant because the very prominent supercharger isn't producing the signature whine you would normally hear.\nThe film car versus what was actually driven\nIn Fast and Furious, Dom's Charger is said to have 900 horsepower and achieved a 9-second quarter-mile time. While a time like that may seem possible, especially with the brawny supercharger on display, it's purely fiction. Only a handful of exotic, high-performance cars can get under 10 seconds in the quarter mile, with the fastest being a 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT Weissach, with a 9.2-second time, according to Motor Trend.\nObviously, the film crew couldn't use something with nearly 1000 horsepower for shooting, as it would be more dangerous and difficult to control under throttle. So the car you're seeing during the movie is actually sporting a 440 Magnum or a smaller 318 engine, depending on the scene.\nTo shatter the magic of the movie even further, other than the close-up shots in Dom's garage, where the Chuck Tayler Racing engine was used, the iconic scoop is nothing but a visual accessory. The scoop doesn't actually enhance the film car's performance, but it still looks really cool."
