  "description": "Lenovo Legion Go 2 Windows-powered gaming handheld with improved performance, better screen has leaked just days before its official launch.",
  "content": "Lenovo\u2019s next generation of its handheld gaming PC has been highly rumored for a while. The company is likely to launch the updated Legion Go 2 at the IFA trade show this week, and we have started to witness full-blown leaks of the Windows-powered handheld.\n\nSince the weekend, we have come across new leaks that reveal the Lenovo Legion Go 2 in its entirety. These leaks come from reputed leaker Evan Blass, who appears to have gotten access to some promotional material that Lenovo seemingly planned to use during and following the official launch. The comprehensive leak provides us with a clear view of the device\u2019s aesthetics and specifications.\n\nFor starters, there aren\u2019t any immediately apparent changes from the Legion Go 2 prototype that Lenovo previewed during CES 2025. While it doesn\u2019t appear identical to the previous two variants, we see elements reminiscent of the earlier devices. It features sharp upper corners from the first-gen Legion Go and the curved grips on the sides of the controllers, as seen on the Legion Go S.\n\nThe left and the right controllers feature two menu buttons, compared to just one each previously. The Legion Go 2 appears to also receive a fingerprint scanner on the top edge for enhanced security. Meanwhile, the circular RGB lights around the two joysticks have breaks in between, resembling the Legion logo. In addition to the two programmable buttons on each controller, the right one gets two additional buttons that are placed more ergonomically for use in the FPS mode.\n\nAdditionally, the rear panel now appears to feature a bigger opening for more air intake than before. The leaked media also points towards a bigger fan than before.\n\nInternally, the Legion Go 2 is powered by AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, a step up from the Z1 Extreme in the previous generation. The chip features a higher number of GPU cores, accompanied by a slight increase in TDP to 35W. Another rumor from the past suggests that there could be a less powerful variant with a base Ryzen Z2 chip.\n\nLenovo is also upgrading the display from an IPS to a 144Hz OLED display with variable refresh rate support. Visually, it may appear the same because it still measures 8.8 inches and retains the same 16:10 aspect ratio.\n\nFinally, another leak from Notebookcheck suggests that the Legion Go 2 might be available for a starting price of \u20ac999 (~$1,170) at launch, although US prices may differ from the direct currency conversion and could be impacted by the varying tariffs imposed by the current administration. We expect to learn more by the end of this week, which is when Lenovo is expected to launch the handheld.\n\nAdditionally, while the Legion Go 2 could go on sale in Europe later this month, the launch in North America could be delayed until November.",

Learn more.\nForget the Steam Deck, this 12.5-inch handheld can play games at 4K 100FPS\nAugust 12, 2025\n- A modder has created a handheld gaming PC with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU.\n- The handheld\u2019s display is 12.5 inches with a 4K resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels.\n- It\u2019s capable of running God of War (2018) in 4K resolution at 100FPS.\nHandheld gaming PCs are getting more powerful all the time. However, they still can\u2019t replace the level of performance you get from a full-on gaming laptop. Or can they? One modder has taken that idea and put it to the test.\nA Bilibili creator who goes by Qingchen DIY has built a giant 12.5-inch handheld gaming PC (h/t El Chapuzas Informatico). But it\u2019s not the size that\u2019s impressive, it\u2019s the fact that the modder fitted it with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU. Along with that high-end GPU, there\u2019s also a 24-core Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU. The system is also equipped with a 12.5-inch IPS touch display with a 4K resolution (3,840 x 2,160 pixels), 64GB of DDR5 RAM, and 2TB of storage.\nIt\u2019s safe to say that the power behind this device easily surpasses the top names in the market, like Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and ASUS\u2019 ROG Ally X. You could even say this system is more of a laptop that was simply converted into a handheld. But what can this beast of a handheld actually do?\nIn the video, the modder shows the device running Cyberpunk 2077 in 4K resolution at 60FPS. That\u2019s not bad considering that other handhelds tend to struggle running the title at just 1080p, with upscaling technologies helping out. What\u2019s even more impressive is that at one point, the modder shows the device running God of War (2018) in 4K at above 100FPS.\nAs you can imagine, this is likely a pretty power-hungry device. It appears this device relies on an external power source. However, it does also have a built-in 50Wh battery.\nWhile it would be fun to give this system a try, we\u2019ll probably stick with our Steam Deck. A 12.5-inch handheld would be a bit unwieldy for most hands.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Exclusive: Lenovo Legion Go 2 could cost $200 more than Asus ROG Xbox Ally X at launch\nTrue next-generation Windows gaming handhelds have taken a while to come to market from major manufacturers. For context, smaller companies like Ayaneo, GPD and One-Netbook have released AMD Strix Point-based options like the Ayaneo 3, the latest Win 4 and the OneXFly F1 Pro (curr. $1,439 on Amazon). However, Asus, MSI and Lenovo have been leaving fans waiting for months.\nIn Lenovo's case, it first showcased the Legion Go 2 in January during CES 2025, but only in prototype form. Since then, a smattering of leaks have provided more details about the device, including prospective performance courtesy of videos featuring more prototype units. The other day, Evan Blass indicated that the Legion Go 2 would be gracing IFA 2025 next week in Berlin, along with a host of other devices including numerous ThinkPad laptops.\nSubsequently, a reader who wishes to remain anonymous reached out with more information about the Legion Go 2 before its full IFA 2025 debut. Although the reader has not provided a source for the information provided, we have every reason to believe its authenticity based on what we have seen so far. Nonetheless, we would always recommend exercising some caution with leaks of this kind.\nAccording to our source, Lenovo intends to begin selling the new Legion Go from early September in the Eurozone but not until November in North America. Lenovo is also said to have settled on \u20ac999 launch pricing; unfortunately, our source was unable to specify whether this pricing applies to Ryzen Z2 or Ryzen Z2 Extreme variants. With that being said, a hands-on video that emerged earlier this summer confirms that Lenovo has been working on a lesser Ryzen Z2 variant as well as a Ryzen Z2 Extreme option. Incidentally, MSI has priced the similar Claw A8 at between \u20ac899 and \u20ac999 in the Eurozone.\nApparently, the Legion Go 2 could be comparatively expensive in North America, too. At this stage, our source stresses that Lenovo has not settled on firm North American pricing, possibly because of fluctuating US tariffs. Even so, they claim that Lenovo is considering pricing the Legion Go 2 between $1,049 and $1,099 in the US, which would be much higher than the alleged $899 starting price for the ROG Xbox Ally X.\nSource(s)\nNotebookcheck"

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe Lenovo Legion Go S (with Windows) makes so many mistakes I can't figure out how we got here\nFebruary 20, 2025\nLenovo Legion Go S with Windows\nMSRP: $729.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nLenovo Legion Go S with Windows\nWhen the Steam Deck launched in 2022, it was hardly the first PC gaming handheld to hit the market. The Nintendo Switch had already categorically proven that large-screened handheld gaming systems were what people wanted five years prior, and other manufacturers had seen minor success with Windows-based devices. However, the Steam Deck was the first thing to come along and set the bar for what a PC gaming handheld could and should be. Now, all other gaming handhelds must meet that bar, or they will be dead in the water.\nKeeping that in mind, Lenovo is in a unique position with its line of Legion handhelds. At CES earlier this year, the company announced the market\u2019s first true Steam Deck competitor, meaning third-party hardware running the same Linux-based Steam OS that comes with the Steam Deck. It is officially called the Lenovo Legion Go S \u2014 Powered by Steam OS. That device has yet to hit retail, but in the meantime, Lenovo has a stop-gap product that is almost the same but running good ol\u2019 Windows 11. That\u2019s the one this review is about.\nI went into reviewing this with as much of an open mind as possible. Yes, I know that this isn\u2019t the Lenovo handheld most gamers are excited about \u2014 they want to see what the Steam OS version is like. But Lenovo sent me the Windows-based Legion Go S, and I\u2019ve been using it for about a week now. I hate to say it, but this is so off the mark \u2014 so bafflingly mediocre \u2014 that I\u2019m going to say something I rarely ever say: No one should buy this.\nStrap in, and I\u2019ll tell you why.\nLooks great, but I can\u2019t play it for more than 30 minutes\nBefore I get into all the things wrong with the Legion Go S, I want to point out some good things, all of which relate to its design.\nFirst, let me say that I love the look and overall feel of the Legion Go S. It abandons the Switch-like detachable controllers and kickstand of the original Lenovo Legion Go, but is far more ergonomically satisfiying as a regular handheld. The super-curvy grips with a micro-textured finish fit nicely into my palms. The analog sticks are nice and tall, with very smooth movement. The ABXY face buttons don\u2019t feel too mushy nor too clicky, and the triggers and bumpers are large and tactile. I also really like the white colorway, even though it does make it look a whole lot like an ASUS ROG Ally.\nThere is a lot to love about the Legion Go S when looking at its design, buttons, sticks, and especially its 8-inch LCD panel.\nThe RGB lighting surrounding the sticks is also nice. You can\u2019t control it granularly, but you can shut it off or make it one solid color. I\u2019m an RGB puke fan myself, so I left it at full tilt rainbow.\nI also truly love the display on the Legion Go S. It is a massive 8-inch LCD panel with a 16:10 aspect ratio and a resolution of 1,920 x 1,200. Its variable refresh rate (going from 48Hz to 120Hz) makes gameplay look smooth and crisp while also being pretty big for a gaming handheld. OLED would have been nice to see here, but I had no complaints about the device\u2019s visual experience.\nThankfully, the front-facing speakers here are very loud and sound great. Granted, I assume most people will use headphones most of the time, but if you\u2019re not, you\u2019ll have no trouble hearing your game\u2019s audio.\nHowever, all this good stuff is for naught due to several flaws, with one very significant one: weight.\nI found it difficult to hold the Legion Go S for long periods of time. It's just too heavy with poor weight distribution.\nThe first time I ever picked up a Steam Deck, I immediately thought to myself, \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t expect it to be this light.\u201d In reality, the Steam Deck OLED (the fractionally lighter, refreshed model Valve released in late 2023) weighs about 1.41 pounds, which is actually fairly heavy \u2014 much heavier than holding any standard controller, at least. The Nintendo Switch OLED weighs less than a pound to give further comparison. The Lenovo Legion Go S, though, weighs more than a Steam Deck at 1.62 pounds and, crucially, doesn\u2019t distribute that weight nearly as well. This results in it being uncomfortable to use the Legion Go S continuously for long gaming sessions.\nObviously, one of the biggest reasons for the success of gaming handhelds is the fact that you can bring one on a train, plane, or long car ride and play your PC games on the go. If you can\u2019t sit there and play for more than 30 minutes without needing to give your wrists a break, what\u2019s the point? Lenovo tried to solve this problem with the original Legion Go, which had those aforementioned Switch-like removable controllers. This allowed you to hold just the controllers and keep the heavy 8.8-inch display on a table or even your lap. That\u2019s not the case with the Legion Go S, though. Everything is permanently attached, so you need to hold the whole thing.\nOutside of the weight, Lenovo made some other baffling hardware decisions. The microSD card reader, for example, is on the bottom, making it tricky to swap your card if the device is docked. The two USB-C 4.0 ports are directly next to one another on top of the Legion Go S, which means there is barely enough room for two things to be plugged in at the same time \u2014 say, for example, a USB stick and the charging cable. Why even have two ports at all?\nLenovo did fix a mistake it made with the original Legion Go, which was putting the Start and Select buttons right next to each other on the bottom left \u2014 you know, a spot where literally no other controller puts them. With the Legion Go S, those buttons are at the top and on opposite sides of the display, as they should be, so your thumbs can access them. However, Lenovo then bungled this by putting its two custom buttons above these and separating them by mere millimeters. As you\u2019d expect, I found myself accidentally hitting one of these Lenovo buttons instead of the Start button numerous times.\nThere are so many design flubs here that it's difficult to imagine no one at Lenovo realizing it.\nFor the record, the button on the right (Lenovo R) launches Lenovo\u2019s Quick Settings program, and the one on the left (Lenovo L) launches Legion Space, which compiles all your installed games, sells you new ones, and offers some other tweaks to your settings. Both programs are useful \u2014 I just hate accidentally launching one when I want to pause my game or open my inventory.\nLenovo also installed one of the worst haptic motors I\u2019ve ever experienced on any system or controller. It only works on the right side of the device, and it\u2019s noisy. If you own a Sony DualSense, you\u2019re accustomed to a pleasant, low-frequency hum rattling your bones across both hands. On this, it\u2019s a shrill \u201cbzzt\u201d in just your right hand that feels more like an electric shock than anything else.\nFinally, I must also bring up the teeny, tiny trackpad. If you can\u2019t find it, it\u2019s the microscopic square under the right stick. Yes, that is a trackpad for mouse movement that was designed for ants. It\u2019s not easy to move the mouse around with it, unsurprisingly, and trying to double-click anything is a total nightmare. Also, by default, Lenovo has it set to vibrate that terrible haptic motor the entire time you\u2019re touching the trackpad. It\u2019s just non-stop vibrating noisily. Thankfully, you can turn this off in settings, but even then, I avoided using the trackpad as much as I could.\nSoftware and performance: \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nI\u2019d like to begin this section by saying that I am a big fan of Windows. I\u2019ve always used Windows, and I have a Windows gaming rig at home, so I know it very well. I even really like Windows 11, specifically, which I know is a hot take. I also know that there are plenty of reasons someone would want Windows on a gaming handheld, with game compatibility being high on the list.\nUnfortunately, Windows just isn\u2019t integrated well on this handheld (or any handheld, really). Simple things like using the analog sticks to navigate around the operating system don\u2019t work out of the box, for example. The on-screen keyboard doesn\u2019t automatically pop up when you need it to. Using your fingers to accurately double-tap tiny icons is tricky, especially if you have large hands. Many programs rely on keyboard shortcuts, which you can\u2019t perform easily on a device without a keyboard (you can\u2019t even CTRL-ALT-DEL with the on-screen keyboard, although Lenovo does offer a shortcut macro for this purpose). Granted, you can solve many of these issues by tweaking Windows, but that\u2019s work Lenovo should be doing, not me.\nWindows on a gaming handheld is a love-it-of-hate-it thing. Yes, game compatibility is nice, but it comes at significant usability costs.\nIf you can look past these obstacles for the benefits Windows offers over other systems, more power to you. But I felt they needed to be mentioned.\nAlthough Lenovo left the Windows install alone, the two programs it offers for tweaking the Legion Go S are quite useful. The Quick Settings panel \u2014 accessed at any time by hitting the Lenovo R button directly above Start \u2014 allows you to hot swap between two pre-configured modes, with one being focused on performance and the other being focused on battery. These two settings are pretty polar. The performance setting pushes most settings to the max, and the quiet setting drops them all to a bare minimum. Thankfully, there are two empty custom profiles, so you could make one yourself that\u2019s a bit more in the middle. Once again, it would have been nice for Lenovo to create a middle-ground setting for you, but it is what it is.\nTweaking any of these settings alters how much work the processor does, so let\u2019s jump into that. Inside the Lenovo Legion Go S is the new AMD Ryzen Z2 Go. This is the first device launched with this processor, so I can\u2019t make an apples-to-apples comparison with it, but I can say that it is weaker than the Ryzen Z1 that appeared in the original Legion Go, ASUS ROG Ally, and a few other handhelds. It also pales in comparison to the Z1 Extreme, the top-end model in the Z1 family. This is primarily due to the Z2 Go only having four cores and eight threads.\nIn other words, this 2025 processor is weaker than the 2023 processors you\u2019ll find in older and, critically, less expensive handhelds.\nThe AMD Ryzen Z2 Go only has four cores and eight threads, which makes it weaker than the 2023 Ryzen Z1.\nIf you can look past that, the Ryzen Z2 Go is fine for most purposes. With the performance setting fully throttled, I was able to enjoy 30fps gameplay in Horizon Forbidden West on medium-quality settings and the resolution set to 720p. I had a similar experience with the Resident Evil 4 remake. Lighter games, like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder\u2019s Revenge, played perfectly with a solid 60fps quality or better at 1080p. I could even drop the performance toggle to its quietest, most battery-saving setting for those kinds of games. This was nice, too, as the fans get pretty loud in performance mode.\nEmulation also went well. Unsurprisingly, it can churn through emulating any system prior to the PlayStation 2. I also could emulate PS2 and PS3 games (although I needed to do some tweaks for the latter). Nintendo Switch emulation was also possible, although there was lots of stuttering, dropped frames, and other issues as I played a game that, for legal reasons, I will simply call umm\u2026 Demon King? Secret Stones?\u2026 anyway, it was still playable but not enjoyable. Other Switch titles \u2014 like one where an Italian plumber goes on an odyssey \u2014 fared much better.\nPlaying AAA games and emulating newer consoles is possible, but temper your expectations as far as quality goes.\nI did face an issue emulating a game for the Wii U that I\u2019ll call Amnesiac Elf Boy Helps Local Royalty with Home Repairs. I couldn\u2019t get this game to launch at all. I did some digging and found that newer AMD drivers don\u2019t play nice with the most popular Wii U emulator. Allegedly, you can roll back drivers to make it work, but I didn\u2019t bother. So, if you were looking forward to emulating Amnesiac Elf Boy Helps Local Royalty with Home Repairs on your Legion Go S, you\u2019re going to need to work for it.\nThe bottom line is that the Ryzen Z2 Go is OK for running games at high quality if they aren\u2019t AAA. If they are, you\u2019ll need to drop quality and resolution settings significantly to create an enjoyable experience. Emulating all the major consoles is possible, but it won\u2019t be a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d experience as it would be on a more robust system with the Ryzen Z1 Extreme, to say nothing about something with a dGPU.\nFinally, battery life is just OK. I do not have a Legion Go to test this against, but the testing I\u2019ve done on the Legion Go S compared to tests on the Go that I\u2019ve read online suggests battery life on the Legion Go S is about the same as what was seen on the Legion Go. This is curious because the battery cell in the Legion Go S is bigger than the one in the Legion Go: 55.5WHr vs 49.2WHr. My guess is that the Ryzen Z1 and Z1 Extreme are simply more battery efficient than the Ryzen Z2 Go because of their more advanced architectures, so the battery capacity increase is a wash. Regardless, with a AAA title like Horizon Forbidden West running in performance mode, you could eke out maybe 90 minutes of gameplay on a full battery. You could drop down quality even lower (or play less demanding titles) and get a lot more juice, but if your goal is AAA on the go, that\u2019s what you should expect.\nThis isn\u2019t great, clearly, but it would all be acceptable for a product that is not super expensive \u2014 or, at the very least, isn\u2019t as expensive as the flagship product that came before it. With that, we now come to the final \u2014 and most damning \u2014 piece of the Lenovo Legion Go S puzzle.\nLenovo Legion Go S (Windows) review verdict: $729?! In what universe?\nRight now, you can easily get the original Lenovo Legion Go ($699.99 at Lenovo) for under $700 new or even less if you go used. That device has a more powerful processor and a larger display at a higher resolution. It also has removable controllers, allowing you to comfortably game for extended sessions without holding the whole thing.\nIf you wanted to go even lower, you could get an ASUS ROG Ally ($794 at Amazon) for under $600. Once again, that comes with a better processor. The ROG Ally X ($799.99 at Best Buy) is also worth a look, although it might cost you a bit more.\nNot only are there better products out there than the Legion Go S, those superior products are less expensive.\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s the Steam Deck OLED ($549 at Manufacturer site) which starts at $549, brand new and without any discounts. That won\u2019t have the same game compatibility as a Windows-based handheld, but as I mentioned at the top of this review, it is the gold standard due to Steam OS being so user-friendly, and the incredible support Valve and the Steam Deck community provides.\nWith all this in mind, in what universe does Lenovo think that selling the Legion Go S for $729 is a good idea? It simply isn\u2019t worth that much money. It should be hundreds of dollars cheaper than the Legion Go when you consider the downgrades in both specs and hardware. It definitely shouldn\u2019t be more expensive than a Steam Deck OLED. But it is \u2014 nearly $200 more expensive.\nUsually, this is where I would say, \u201cWait for this to go on sale and buy it then.\u201d But I can\u2019t say that because we know that the Legion Go 2 is coming later this year after it was revealed at CES 2025. It will have the full-flavor Ryzen Z2 and Ryzen Z2 Extreme processors that will blow the Ryzen Z2 Go out of the water. It will also have a larger battery and those removable controllers. We don\u2019t know how much it will cost, but the original started at $699. Even if Lenovo significantly increases the price to something like $799 or higher, it still will be a better buy than the Legion Go S.\nWe also know the Steam OS version of this handheld is coming soon and will be significantly cheaper at $499. Yes, Steam OS lacks the full compatibility of Windows when it comes to gaming, but millions of Steam Deck fans seem to be OK with that. Even the emulation scene has figured out ways to emulate most consoles on a Deck, to the point where it\u2019s become something of a tinkerer\u2019s handheld of choice.\nIf you can\u2019t wait around for the Steam OS-powered Legion Go S, a maxed-out Steam Deck OLED with 1TB of storage is $649 right now \u2014 still cheaper than this.\nBy the time the Legion Go S gets discounted to a more reasonable price, there will be new devices with better processors for the same price or less.\nIn other words, no matter how you approach it, the Legion Go S isn\u2019t worth its $729 price, and by the time it drops down significantly, its competition will be a better buy. It would need to drop by over 30% right now to get to the $500 mark for it to be even a consideration. Even then, the LCD version of the Steam Deck might still be the better choice, and that starts at $399. Lenovo simply can\u2019t go that low \u2014 not unless there\u2019s a fire sale.\nBut even if you could look past all this \u2014 if money were literally no object to you \u2014 there\u2019s nothing special about the Legion Go S. There\u2019s nothing about it that it does much differently or better than any other gaming handheld. In some cases, the things it does do differently actually make the product worse, such as that laughably small trackpad or the awkward port placement.\nSo, in the end, I can\u2019t recommend this to anyone. If you want a Windows-based gaming handheld, there are plenty of other options that will be both less expensive and offer you a better experience. If you don\u2019t care if it has Windows or not, any flavor of the Steam Deck will be significantly cheaper and better overall. And, if you just want gaming portability, there are dozens of budget gaming laptops \u2014 even some from Lenovo! \u2014 that will be the same price or less with much better performance thanks to them having a dGPU.\nIgnore the Legion Go S with Windows 11 \u2014 it\u2019s just not worth it. Here\u2019s hoping the Steam version isn\u2019t such a disappointment.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nMicrosoft plans to supercharge Windows handhelds with the Xbox experience\nJanuary 7, 2025\n- Microsoft plans to merge Xbox and Windows gaming experiences for handheld devices.\n- The company\u2019s VP of Next Generation has said that better controller support and interface improvements are on the horizon.\n- More details and updates are expected to roll out later in 2025.\nMicrosoft\u2019s ambitions for a handheld Xbox console are no secret, though such a console is likely still years away. For now, the closest alternative is using the Xbox app and Game Pass on a Windows-based handheld. While functional, the experience is far from ideal, as Windows isn\u2019t inherently designed for console-style gaming. That\u2019s set to change this year.\nJason Ronald, Microsoft\u2019s VP of Next Generation, spoke to The Verge about major improvements headed to Windows handhelds in 2025 to bring a more console-like Xbox gaming experience.\nSpeaking at an AMD and Lenovo event on the sidelines of CES 2025, Ronald hinted at an integrated approach to bring the best of Xbox and Windows together for handheld gaming devices.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been really innovating for a long time in the console space,\u201d Ronald told The Verge. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is really focused on how to bring those innovations to the broader Windows ecosystem, specifically for players and developers.\u201d\nImproving the Windows handheld experience\nThe current state of Windows on handheld devices leaves much to be desired, sometimes requiring workarounds like the community-created fork of SteamOS. Ronald acknowledged these issues with Windows handhelds and assured users that the company is going to simplify the experience.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on really simplifying that and making it much more like a console experience,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to put the player and their library at the center of the experience, not all the (Windows) work you have to do today,\u201d he added.\nMicrosoft is also investing in improving controller support for Windows handhelds and redesigning the interface to feel native to handheld gaming. \u201cThere are just certain things in Windows that were not designed for people without a keyboard and mouse,\u201d Ronald said.\nRather than porting a custom Xbox operating system to handheld PCs, Microsoft plans to enhance Windows handhelds with Xbox-centric features. \u201cAt the end of the day, our goal is to make Windows great for gaming on any device,\u201d said Ronald.\nMore details are expected later this year, but Ronald assured gamers that changes are on the horizon. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a journey, and you\u2019ll see a lot of investments over time.\u201d\nThank you for being part of our community.
