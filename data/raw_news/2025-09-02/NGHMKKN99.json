  "description": "Fed Likely Powerless to Ease Tariffs' Bite on Growth",
  "content": "President Trump\u2019s trade war is raising taxes and slowing growth, but we aren\u2019t headed for a recession.\n\nHigher tariffs on steel, aluminum and automotive products, special levies on China, Canada and Mexico and broad reciprocal tariffs on other countries have raised the average effective rate on all imports from 2% to 19%.\n\nAlthough reciprocal tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Powers Act face a questionable future in the courts, the president has other options to maintain those.\n\nNegotiations with China and most other trading partners won\u2019t quickly result in comprehensive trade agreements, and the deals with the UK, EU, Vietnam and others didn\u2019t alter tariffs much.\n\nConsequently, high tariffs are likely the remainder of Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nIf sustained, those could bring in $3 trillion in new revenue over the next decade. That would roughly offset the deficit increasing effects of the president\u2019s spending initiatives and tax cuts beyond renewing the 2018 Tax Cut and Jobs Act.\n\nLarge federal deficits and growing national debt are a problem, but Trump\u2019s overall tax and spending policies won\u2019t much alter President Biden\u2019s trajectory.\n\nIn 2025, Trump\u2019s tariffs are slowing growth, because those and some of his spending cuts bite this year, whereas the tax cuts won\u2019t boost workers\u2019 take home pay until 2026.\n\nSo far, tariffs haven\u2019t been highly visible. Inflation has ticked and should accelerate by fall.\n\nWhen the president boosted tariffs on washing machines in January 2018, the Consumer Price Index for laundry equipment showed little effect in February and March and then jumped 11% by May.\n\nAs inflation accelerates, consumers will borrow more or spend less. Likely, it will be some of each, as banks are preparing for more losses on credit cards and other loans.\n\nIn January, economic forecasters were predicting 2% GDP growth for this year, but it should slow in the second half and average about 1.5% for all of 2025.\n\nThe conventional thinking is that the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates to give home builders, debt-burdened consumers and overall economic growth a boost but at the expense of stoking inflation. However, the Fed could be mostly powerless.\n\nFrom September to December last year, the Fed cut the federal funds rate\u2014the overnight rate that banks pay to borrow funds\u2014a full percentage point, but the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds jumped from about 3.6% to 4.6%.\n\nThe 10-year rate is the benchmark for most borrowing throughout the economy. Even as the Fed cut the overnight rate last fall, the rate on 30-year mortgages jumped about a percentage point too.\n\nWith the economy near full employment, a peacetime federal deficit exceeding 6% of GDP is unprecedented. Treasury borrowing requirements are overwhelming anything the Fed could do.\n\nWith fiscal and monetary policy essentially in neutral, the consequences of Trump\u2019s tariffs are largely supply side and difficult to sort because businesses are so uncertain about future trade policies.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to say that the average tariff on imports will stay at 19%, but it\u2019s another to know what rates will be charged on specific products from various jurisdictions.\n\nWith more certainty, businesses could more cost efficiently adjust supply chains\u2014for example, invest more to source from Vietnam, Mexico and U.S. factories and less from China. But early episodes with items as simple as children\u2019s toys indicate that finding new suppliers can take months.\n\nParents will face fewer choices, shortages and higher prices filling Christmas stockings, and similar frustrations will repeat throughout the economy.\n\nFor complex products like automobiles and cell phones, building new manufacturing capacity can take years.\n\nThe best clarity business may assume is that Trump\u2019s tariffs will stay mostly as they are. That realization will come slowly, and business investment outside hot artificial intelligence related activities will recover but haltingly.\n\nGDP fell -0.5% in the first quarter, because imports surged in March ahead of the Liberation Day tariffs. That reversed in the second quarter.\n\nTariffs are burdening demand this summer and fall but not enough to drag the economy into a recession.\n\nInflation will surge above 3% and then subside as we move through 2026 if the Fed doesn\u2019t enable reckless federal deficits by slashing interest rates.\n\nNext year, the economy will be back on track. The hit to growth and purchasing power from tariffs will prove a one-time adjustment, as we learn to live with Trump\u2019s protectionism.\n\nPeter Morici is an economist and emeritus business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.",

If you have a story idea to share, you can send Charlie an email at charlie.keegan@kshb.com.\n\u2014\nTariffs have been in the lesson plan for Steve Bennett. He teaches construction management at Johnson County Community College. Thursday\u2019s class touched on a series of tariffs that President Donald Trump announced Wednesday.\nOne of Trump\u2019s goals is to encourage companies to build products in the United States instead of importing items into the United States. In order to build products in America, companies have to build manufacturing facilities first, which is where the students in Bennett\u2019s class come into play.\n\u201cPeople like you are needed to build these jobs,\u201d Bennett told his students.\nBuilding the production facilities will take time, Bennett warned.\nBefore teaching, he worked in the construction industry. He said crews can build simple manufacturing plants and warehouses in less than one year. Larger. more complex facilities will take years to build.\n\u201cWe can typically build a warehouse in six months. I have built one in 4 and half months,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we call fast-tracking. What we call design-build.\u201d\nKevin Lewis is the CEO of Henderson Companies in Lenexa. The firm uses the design-build approach. This is where you design the facility while you build it. It shaves time off the project's length.\n\u201cThose are words we love to hear. Design-build is something we\u2019re passionate about,\u201d Lewis said.\nHe laid out the typical steps for building a new manufacturing facility.\nIt starts by finding land for the project. Oftentimes, these projects require a lot of land, and cities require owners to build them in certain areas with special zoning privileges.\nLewis wants all his clients to make sure the project will be profitable. He doesn\u2019t want to build something the client can\u2019t pay for.\nThen, engineers and architects design the facility.\nFinally, companies buy the materials and begin building.\n\u201cLong story short, it\u2019s going to take a little while for this to all work through the process and for some of these new construction projects to come to fruition,\u201d Lewis summarized.\nBoth Lewis and Bennett said the construction labor market is short-staffed and has been since the COVID-19 pandemic. They believe the lack of workers might also slow down progress on building new manufacturing facilities.\n\u2014"

      "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump could still find a work-around after suffering a major blow to a core part of his economic agenda.\nThe U.S. Court of International Trade on Wednesday ruled that the president had overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on numerous countries.\nThe New York-based court ordered a permanent halt to most of Trump's tariffs and further barred their future modification. A panel of three judges gave the White House 10 days to complete the formal process of stopping the tariffs. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling.\nGoldman Sachs economists said the White House has a few tools at its disposal that could ensure the court ruling is only a temporary problem.\n\"This ruling represents a setback for the administration's tariff plans and increases uncertainty but might not change the final outcome for most major US trading partners,\" Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note.\n\"For now, we expect the Trump administration will find other ways to impose tariffs,\" they added.\nOptions on the table\nThe Wall Street bank said the ruling blocks the 10% baseline tariff imposed by Trump on most imports, as well as the additional duties on China, Canada and Mexico \u2013 but not sectoral levies, such as those imposed on steel, aluminum and autos.\nThe Trump administration nevertheless has other legal means of imposing tariffs, Goldman says, flagging Section 122 of U.S. trade law, Section 301 investigations and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930.\nSection 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 does not require a formal investigation and could therefore be one of the swiftest ways to get around the court roadblock.\n\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" analysts at Goldman said. They noted, however, that such a move would only last for up to 150 days after which law requires congressional action.\nRead more\nTrump could also swiftly launch Section 301 investigations on key U.S. trading partners, laying the bureaucratic groundwork for tariffs \u2014 although Goldman said that this process will likely take several weeks at a minimum.\nSection 232 tariffs, which are already in place for steel, aluminum and auto imports, could also be broadened to other sectors. This trade law allows the president to take action against threats to national security.\nSection 338, meanwhile, allows the president to impose levies of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. Goldman noted that this particular measure has not been used before.\nMichelle Schulz, founder and managing partner at Schulz Trade Law PLLC, echoed the possibility that the Trump administration would seek work-arounds, including looking at ways the White House has imposed tariffs in the past.\n\"We have had section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods even under the previous administration, which were pretty harsh. So I can imagine that the administration will look at these provisions again and see if they can use 232, or 301, or some other mechanism where, whereby they can enforce the tariffs,\" she told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Thursday.\nSchulz also pointed to the fact that such tariffs require investigations.\n\"I think that's the difference here. All of the tariffs that we're talking about today with IEEPA were issued under executive order and pretty much just by the executive branch,\" she said. \"When you look at these other sections, you're going to have the involvement of the Commerce Department and other agencies investigating whether there really has been damage\" to justify tariff action.\nSchulz added that such investigations could take months.\nCNBC has reached out to the White House for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\nWhat about the Supreme Court?\nJames Ransdell, partner at the law firm Cassidy Levy Kent, said the court opinion marks the first of many other cases still pending \u2014 and the first substantive opinion out of federal court \"to really address the meat of the plaintiffs challenge.\"\nRansdell said the speed of the Trump administration's appeal was \"very unusual\" and suggests the government could be working through the night to prepare its motion for an emergency stay of the order.\nHe added that it was \"certainly a possibility\" that the Supreme Court could end up having the last say.\n\"There is not a lot of precedent on this particular statute and on similar actions by the president, so there might be an interest that the Supreme Court has in taking this up,\" Ransdell told CNBC's \"The China Connection\" on Thursday.\nSteven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard, said Trump had a \"very good\" level of understanding of how to play the courts to get what he wants in terms of playing for time.\n\"The first thing he will probably do is an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court \u2026 wanting to get a ruling from them that basically says you can keep these tariffs in place while the appeals process runs through,\" Blitz said Thursday.\n\"This king-like executive order was always going to, at some point, going to run into the courts. \u2026 The difference between being a monarchy and being a constitutional democracy is the legal system,\" he added.\nStocks, U.S. dollar on the rise\nEquity markets around the world broadly rose on Thursday as investors reacted to the legal ruling. Asia-Pacific markets ended the day mostly higher and U.S. futures jumped.\nMarket reaction in Europe was more muted, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 up a mere 0.3% by early afternoon London time. The euro was last seen trading at $1.1285, little changed for the session after paring earlier losses.\nJordan Rochester, head of FICC strategy at Mizuho EMEA, said in a note that the limited market reaction was \"because Trump still has various options to raise tariffs.\"\n\"Things are more complicated but the end goal for Trump remains the same. In politics when there is a will, there is a way,\" he said.\nThe U.S. dollar rose slightly against major rivals, with the U.S. dollar index up 0.07%. So far this year, the dollar index has tumbled close to 8% amid continued market turmoil."

      "text": "Trump's tariffs could cut deficit by $2.8 trillion over next decade \u2014 with caveats\nCongressional forecasters say President Trump's tariffs could raise trillions of dollars over the next decade \u2014 if they remain in place \u2014 more than offsetting the additional red ink that's projected to flow from a sweeping budget bill passed by the House last month.\nSince taking office in January, Trump has imposed taxes of 10 to 50% on nearly everything the U.S. imports. Those taxes have already raised tens of billions of dollars in revenue.\nIf the tariffs become permanent, they're expected to reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion by 2035, according to a letter released Wednesday by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.\nA separate CBO forecast out earlier in the day shows the combination of tax cuts and spending cuts in the House-passed budget bill would increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the same period.\nThere are big unknowns, however\nThe tariff forecast includes a number of caveats.\n\"Because the United States has implemented no increases in tariffs of this size in many decades, there is little relevant empirical evidence on their effects,\" writes CBO director Phillip Swagel. The high taxes might discourage imports more than expected, which would result in lower revenues. On the other hand, if imports drop less than expected due to tariffs, the government could end up raising more money.\nThe forecast assumes that most of the tariffs in place in mid-May are made permanent. It does not include the doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that took effect Wednesday, or the prospect that higher tariffs, which have been temporarily suspended, might return.\nMany of the tariffs were imposed under a novel reading of a 1977 law, and they are being challenged in court, though they remain in effect for now.\nIn addition to cutting deficits, forecasters project the tariffs will result in higher inflation this year and next and slower economic growth.\nForecasters say tariffs will likely raise prices for both rich families and poor families, although the CBO is still sorting out which end of the income ladder would be hit hardest."

      "text": "The Long-Term Budget Outlook: 2025 to 2055\nExtending the 10-year budget projections it published on January 17, 2025, CBO projects that federal debt held by the public, boosted by sustained deficits, will grow far beyond any previously recorded level over the next 30 years.\nSummary\nThis report presents the Congressional Budget Office's projections of what the federal budget and the economy would look like over the next 30 years if current laws generally remained unchanged. Those long-term projections are based on the agency's January 2025 demographic projections (which reflect information, laws, and policies as of November 15, 2024), economic projections (which reflect laws, policies, and economic developments as of December 4, 2024), and 10-year budget projections (which include the effects of legislation enacted as of January 6, 2025). The projections do not reflect the effects of administrative actions taken or judicial decisions made after those respective dates, including actions and decisions affecting immigration, tariffs, and other policy areas.\nThe Federal Budget\nDebt held by the public, boosted by large deficits, reaches its highest level ever in 2029 (measured as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP) and then continues to grow, reaching 156 percent of GDP in 2055. It remains on track to increase thereafter. Mounting debt would slow economic growth, push up interest payments to foreign holders of U.S. debt, and pose significant risks to the fiscal and economic outlook; it could also cause lawmakers to feel constrained in their policy choices.\nThe deficit remains large by historical standards over the next 30 years, reaching 7.3 percent of GDP in 2055. That amount results from rising interest costs and sustained primary deficits, which exclude net outlays for interest and average 0.3 percent of GDP more over the next 30 years than they did over the past 50 years.\nOutlays, which are already high by historical standards, rise over the 2025\u20132055 period, reaching 26.6 percent of GDP in 2055. Rising interest costs; spending for the major health care programs, particularly Medicare; and spending for Social Security, especially over the next decade, drive that growth.\nRevenues increase over the next few years, largely because certain provisions of the 2017 tax act are scheduled to expire. Thereafter, they generally rise, reaching 19.3 percent of GDP in 2055, as growth in real income\u2014that is, income adjusted to remove the effects of changes in prices\u2014boosts receipts from the individual income tax.\nChanges in CBO's Budget Projections Since March 2024\nFederal debt held by the public in 2054 is now projected to be 12 percent of GDP less than it was projected to be in last year's report, and the deficit is now projected to be 1.3 percent of GDP less. Lower spending, particularly for net interest costs and Medicare, and higher revenues in the current projections contribute to the lower projected debt and smaller projected deficits.\nThe U.S. Economy\nPopulation growth, which has a significant effect on the economy, is slower over the next 30 years than it was over the past 30 years. Without immigration, the U.S. population would begin to shrink in 2033.\nEconomic growth is slower over the next three decades than it was over the past three decades. The slowdown in the growth of output results from slower growth in the size and productivity of the labor force; the latter stems partly from increased federal borrowing.\nInflation slows through 2027 to a rate that is consistent with the Federal Reserve's long-term goal of 2 percent and then remains at rates that are consistent with that goal from 2027 to 2055.\nThe interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes stays close over the next three decades to what it was, on average, over the past 30 years, reflecting upward pressure from increases in federal borrowing and downward pressure from slowdowns in the growth of the labor force.\nChanges in CBO's Economic Projections Since March 2024\nThe economy is now expected to grow more slowly, on average, over the next 30 years than CBO projected last year. That decrease stems mainly from slower growth of private investment and consumer spending over the next decade and slower growth of the labor force over the last decade of the projection period. The interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes is also lower, on average, in the current projections."

      "text": "Open Market Operations\nOpen market operations (OMOs)--the purchase and sale of securities in the open market by a central bank--are a key tool used by the Federal Reserve in the implementation of monetary policy. The short-term objective for open market operations is specified by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Before the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve used OMOs to adjust the supply of reserve balances so as to keep the federal funds rate--the interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight--around the target established by the FOMC.\nThe Federal Reserve's approach to the implementation of monetary policy has evolved considerably since the financial crisis, and particularly so since late 2008 when the FOMC established a near-zero target range for the federal funds rate. From the end of 2008 through October 2014, the Federal Reserve greatly expanded its holding of longer-term securities through open market purchases with the goal of putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and thus supporting economic activity and job creation by making financial conditions more accommodative.\nDuring the policy normalization process that commenced in December 2015, the Federal Reserve first used overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs)--a type of OMO--as a supplementary policy tool, as necessary, to help control the federal funds rate and keep it in the target range set by the FOMC.\nIn September 2019, the Federal Reserve used term and overnight repurchase agreements (repo) to ensure that the supply of reserves remain ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. The Federal Reserve continued to offer overnight repos and, amid the COVID-related stress around March 2020, term and overnight repos played an important role in ensuring that the supply of reserves remained ample and supporting the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets.\nIn the Statement Regarding Repurchase Agreement Arrangements released on July 28, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced the establishment of a domestic standing repo facility (SRF). Under the SRF, the Federal Reserve conducts daily overnight repo operations against eligible securities. The SRF serves as a backstop in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning.\nFor additional information, see: http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_openmarketops.htm\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York publishes a detailed explanation of OMOs each year in its Annual Report. For a description of open market operations during the 1990s, see the article in the Federal Reserve Bulletin (102 KB PDF).\nFor additional information on how the Federal Reserve will use ON RRPs during the policy normalization process, see: http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/overnight-reverse-repurchase-agreements.htm\nFOMC's target federal funds rate or range, change (basis points) and level\n2024 | 2023 | 2022 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2008 | 2007 | 2006 | 2005 | 2004 | 2003 | Historical Archive\n2024\n| December 19 |\n0 |\n25 |\n4.25-4.50 |\n| November 8 |\n0 |\n25 |\n4.50-4.75 |\n| September 19 |\n0 |\n50 |\n4.75-5.00 |\nBack to year navigation\n2023\n| July 27 |\n25 |\n0 |\n5.25-5.50 |\n| May 4 |\n25 |\n0 |\n5.00-5.25 |\n| March 23 |\n25 |\n0 |\n4.75-5.00 |\n| February 2 |\n25 |\n0 |\n4.50-4.75 |\nBack to year navigation\n2022\n| December 15 |\n50 |\n0 |\n4.25-4.50 |\n| November 3 |\n75 |\n0 |\n3.75-4.00 |\n| September 22 |\n75 |\n0 |\n3.00-3.25 |\n| July 28 |\n75 |\n0 |\n2.25-2.50 |\n| June 16 |\n75 |\n0 |\n1.50-1.75 |\n| May 5 |\n50 |\n0 |\n0.75-1.00 |\n| March 17 |\n25 |\n0 |\n0.25-0.50 |\nBack to year navigation\n2020\n| March 16 |\n0 |\n100 |\n0-0.25 |\n| March 4* |\n0 |\n50 |\n1.00-1.25 |\nBack to year navigation\n2019\n| October 31 |\n0 |\n25 |\n1.50-1.75 |\n| September 19 |\n0 |\n25 |\n1.75-2.00 |\n| August 1 |\n0 |\n25 |\n2.00-2.25 |\nBack to year navigation\n2018\n| December 20 |\n25 |\n0 |\n2.25-2.50 |\n| September 27 |\n25 |\n0 |\n2.00-2.25 |\n| June 14 |\n25 |\n0 |\n1.75-2.00 |\n| March 22 |\n25 |\n0 |\n1.50-1.75 |\nBack to year navigation\n2017\n| December 14 |\n25 |\n0 |\n1.25-1.50 |\n| June 15 |\n25 |\n0 |\n1.00-1.25 |\n| March 16 |\n25 |\n0 |\n0.75-1.00 |\nBack to year navigation\n2016\n| December 15 |\n25 |\n0 |\n0.50-0.75 |\nBack to year navigation\n2015\n| December 17 |\n25 |\n0 |\n0.25-0.50 |\nBack to year navigation\n2008\n| December 16 |\n... |\n75-100 |\n0-0.25 |\n| October 29 |\n... |\n50 |\n1.00 |\n| October 8 |\n... |\n50 |\n1.50 |\n| April 30 |\n... |\n25 |\n2.00 |\n| March 18 |\n... |\n75 |\n2.25 |\n| January 30 |\n... |\n50 |\n3.00 |\n| January 22 |\n... |\n75 |\n3.50 |\nBack to year navigation\n2007\n| December 11 |\n... |\n25 |\n4.25 |\n| October 31 |\n... |\n25 |\n4.50 |\n| September 18 |\n... |\n50 |\n4.75 |\nBack to year navigation\n2006\n| June 29 |\n25 |\n... |\n5.25 |\n| May 10 |\n25 |\n... |\n5.00 |\n| March 28 |\n25 |\n... |\n4.75 |\n| January 31 |\n25 |\n... |\n4.50 |\nBack to year navigation\n2005\n| December 13 |\n25 |\n... |\n4.25 |\n| November 1 |\n25 |\n... |\n4.00 |\n| September 20 |\n25 |\n... |\n3.75 |\n| August 9 |\n25 |\n... |\n3.50 |\n| June 30 |\n25 |\n... |\n3.25 |\n| May 3 |\n25 |\n... |\n3.00 |\n| March 22 |\n25 |\n... |\n2.75 |\n| February 2 |\n25 |\n... |\n2.50 |\nBack to year navigation\n2004\n| December 14 |\n25 |\n... |\n2.25 |\n| November 10 |\n25 |\n... |\n2.00 |\n| September 21 |\n25 |\n... |\n1.75 |\n| August 10 |\n25 |\n... |\n1.50 |\n| June 30 |\n25 |\n... |\n1.25 |\nBack to year navigation\n2003\nBack to year navigation"

  "argos_summary": "Trump\u2019s trade war has pushed the average effective tariff rate on imports to 19%, generating an estimated $3\u202ftrillion in revenue over a decade while dampening growth and raising inflation. A recent U.S. Court of International Trade ruling halted most of the tariffs, but the administration may use alternative legal tools such as Section\u202f122, 301, or 232 to maintain pressure. The policy is expected to slow U.S. GDP growth to about 1.5\u202f% in 2025, increase borrowing costs, and keep inflation above 3\u202f% until 2026, but it is unlikely to trigger a recession. The Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to offset the fiscal drag is limited by rising debt and constrained monetary policy space.",
