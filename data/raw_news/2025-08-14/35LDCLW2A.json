She had boundless energy and was very determined to achieve whatever she set out to do,\u201d Hayley\u2019s dad, Dave, told People in a statement. \u201cShe set her sights on bodybuilding and fitness and achieved the highest success that sector offered.

She was also part of the 2005 documentary \u201cRaising the Bar,\u201d which highlights the world of the sport.\n\n\u201cThe quest for getting huge will never end,\u201d McNeff said about her career in the documentary. \u201cThere\u2019s no limit. I hope there\u2019s a day that I\u2019ll be able to look in the mirror 100% of the time and be like, \u2018Yeah man, I\u2019m huge.'\u201d\n\nAfter retirement from the sport, McNeff decided to pursue a graduate degree in psychology.\n\n\u201cShe had a gift for making those around her laugh and feel welcomed,\u201d the obituary reads. \u201cHer energy and determination was a constant in her life and she always accomplished what she set out to achieve.

She appeared in @dave_pulcinella RAISING THE BAR videos back in the day and I was proud to be able to call her a friend. Prayers to her family and friends. R.I.P. @official_rxmuscle.\u201d\n\nMcNeff is one of many bodybuilders who have recently passed away.\n\nZunila Hoyos Mendez died at 43 in June after she was killed in a hammer attack.

      "text": "Apparently ejections now comes in threes.\nA trio of WNBA players earned the boot Wednesday night following an altercation during the Sun\u2019s 71-62 home win over the Sky.\nConnecticut\u2019s Bria Harley and Chicago\u2019s Rebecca Allen each received ejections for starting the scuffle, while the Sky\u2019s Ariel Atkins\u2019 night ended early \u201cfor being an escalator\u201d after shoving Hartley and touching a referee, according to crew chief Angelia Suffern as reported by ESPN.\nThe situation unfolded early in the second quarter when the Sun\u2019s Saniya Rivers and Hartley battled Allen for a rebound, which the former corralled.\nHartley and Allen tangled arms and in the battle for the ball, Hartley seemingly shoved Allen to the floor.\nAllen attempted to grab Hartley as she fell before later taking a hold of her jersey for several seconds while her opponent stood over her.\nPlayers from both sides eventually made their way over, with Atkins running full steam into a referee while she attempted to confront Hartley.\nWhile said referee attempted to distance Atkins from Harley, she nudged the official.\nAtkins and Hartley then yelled at one another as the tensions started to calm down.\nThe skirmish reportedly stopped play for roughly 10 minutes.\nHartley and Allen both did not score in their 10 minutes before being ejected, while Atkins had five points.\nSky coach Tyler Marsh called the situation \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\u201cI think things like that have a tendency to happen when there\u2019s not a control put on the game prior to \u2014 there\u2019s usually an incident that goes overlooked that leads to something like that,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cI think [Allen] clearly got elbowed in the face right in front of the ref. It wasn\u2019t called. Then, other things ensued.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for us. Two players that play high-quality, high-valuable minutes for us, we were down for most of the game. It was tough. I thought the team rallied back, fought hard to finish it out but it\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\nThe ejections left the Sky with just eight players available in the second half due to Angel Reese missing the game with a back injury and Courtney Vandersloot being sidelined with an ACL tear.\nThe Sky (8-24) have now lost 11 of 12, including three straight."

      "text": "Taylor Swift didn\u2019t sugarcoat a thing while discussing her first date with Travis Kelce that took place sometime after the Chiefs tight end attended an Eras Tour show in Kansas City in the summer of 2023.\nDuring her world-consuming appearance on the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast Wednesday, Swift recalled not knowing anything about football \u2014 and asking Kelce \u201cthe most insane question\u201d about playing in the Super Bowl against his brother, former Eagles center Jason Kelce, who retired in March 2024.\n\u201cI knew he wasn\u2019t crazy the first couple of times we talked\u2026 He\u2019s like a human exclamation point,\u201d Swift, 35, said. \u201cI use so many more exclamation points now. And you aren\u2019t judgmental that I knew nothing about the world you\u2019re in.\n\u201cOn our first date, I legitimately asked him what it was like when the Chiefs played the Eagles in the Super Bowl, and he looked across the line of scrimmage and saw his brother standing five feet away from him.\u201d\nTravis was speechless because that wasn\u2019t possible, as the brothers played offensive positions and wouldn\u2019t be on the field at the same time.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even look at me,\u201d Swift said, laughing.\n\u201cI now know what an insane question that was\u2026 I thought everyone was out there at the same time\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what a first down was\u2026 what a tight end was\u2026 I fell in love with it, I became obsessed with it.\u201d\nKelce and Swift went public with their relationship in October 2023, when they were spotted holding hands in New York City.\nIn an interview with Time magazine that December, Swift said they were a couple when she attended the Sept. 24 game against the Bears at Arrowhead Stadium \u2014 and \u201cwe walked right in\u201d through the general admission entrance.\n\u201cI love this new world that Travis has shown me,\u201d Swift said. \u201cIt\u2019s so fun, it\u2019s so exciting, there is so much pressure on these players \u2026 the pressure on sports is such a different type that I have such respect for everyone, everyone on his team.\u201d\nKelce repeatedly said on the podcast that he\u2019s the luckiest guy in the world.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so lucky because I never got to see what the suite was when I played,\u201d said Kelce, to which Swift quipped, \u201cBecause there was never a camera on it.\u201d\nAs for her relationship with sports, pre-Kelce: \u201cI grew up in [Pennsylvania], I always used to hear my dad yelling at the screen watching Eagles games,\u201d Swift said. \u201cI would go to sporting events so that I could sing the national anthem. Everything was a means to an end to get me to do music.\n\u201cBut I definitely became obsessed with sports because of [Travis]. I\u2019m competitive on his behalf.\u201d\nEarlier on the show, Swift said that \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast \u201cgot me a boyfriend because Travis decided to use it as his personal dating app two years ago.\u201d"
