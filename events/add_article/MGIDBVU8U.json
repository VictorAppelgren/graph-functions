      "summary": "President Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. to address crime has shifted them to beautification tasks, such as trash collection and landscaping, after federal workforce cuts. The operation, costing roughly $1 million per day, has drawn criticism for diverting troops from policing duties and for the low public approval of the move. Despite Trump’s claims of high crime rates, data show D.C.’s violent crime is at a 30‑year low, and the crackdown has faced legal pushback and limited effectiveness in reducing crime.",
