  "title": "I replaced Windows 11 with Linux on this mini PC, and it's already paying off for my workflow",
  "description": "If you only have space for a tiny PC, but don't want to skimp on power, the Geekom IT15 gets my recommendation.",
  "content": "I've always enjoyed a mini PC, and any time I can cobble together a system with a tiny form factor, I feel like a kid at Christmas. The latest mini to grace my desktop was the Geekcom IT 15 Mini PC, a truly diminutive machine with a healthy selection of I/O.\n\nThis device measures 4.5 x 4.5 x 2 inches, so it's not only small, but it also includes a VESA mount so you can attach it to the back of your monitor to resemble an all-in-one.\n\nAlso: The best mini PCs you can buy\n\nBut, for me, however, the biggest selling point is the power. Although it's not built for serious gaming or number crunching, for typical use cases, this small PC has more than enough power.\n\nAfter unboxing the IT 15 Mini PC, I attached it to a spare monitor and keyboard. When I booted it up, I was sadly greeted by Windows 11. Yeah, not a fan. I went ahead and walked through the setup, which took far too long, and then did what you probably expected I would do.\n\nI burned Linux to a USB flash drive, inserted the drive, rebooted the PC, and installed Ubuntu Budgie. Instead of installing Linux over Windows, I decided to dual-boot them, mostly so I could compare the performance of each OS. That comparison, of course, is tangential to this review, but it was fun regardless. Plus, I'm exponentially more familiar with Linux than I am with Windows, and I believe Linux gives me a clearer picture of how well a PC can perform.\n\nAfter Linux was installed, I booted into it to kick the tires of the PC. My goal was to treat this as if it were my primary desktop machine, to see if it could stand up to what I throw at it. The first thing I did was to install Ollama AI and Msty, which has become my go-to test for PC hardware.\n\nI figure if a computer can perform well using a local LLM, it'll pretty much do anything the average user would need. One thing to understand is that local LLMs consume a lot of system resources, and without an NPU or Nvidia GPU, all processing is on the shoulders of the CPU.\n\nAlso: This Windows mini PC fits in my hand - and supports up to three 4K monitors\n\nUnfortunately, the IT 15 sports an Intel GPU, which means the CPU will take on the entirety of the AI load, and it showed.\n\nWhen the installation was complete, I fired up the GUI and ran a quick query of \"What is Linux?\" Ollama went to work with the default LLM (gemma3:1b) and immediately began printing replies to the query. On a machine with an Nvidia GPU, the output would be almost instantaneous, but with Ollama using only the CPU, the output was considerably slower. Again, that's not the fault of the CPU, but rather, the lack of a supported GPU. Even so, the output didn't take too long to complete, and I had a very detailed answer to my question.\n\nAfter that test, I went about doing the usual things: browsing, installing software, running upgrades, etc. The CPU in this PC is an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H -- which raises it well above midrange and into high-end territory -- so I could only imagine how fast the AI would perform with an Nvidia GPU. That being said, everything I threw at this tiny beast ran to perfection. Apps launched almost immediately, animations were clean and smooth, and everything on Ubuntu Budgie performed like a champ.\n\nAlso: Why I ditched Google Authenticator for Proton's new 2FA app - and how to set it up\n\nI'd go so far as to say this is the best-performing small-form-factor PC I've ever used. That makes sense, given this machine is targeted at users who want high performance, and it certainly delivers. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more powerful machine at this size.\n\nWith many tiny form-factor PCs, I'm used to seeing a bit of plastic and several corners cut to lower the price. Although the IT 15 does use PC+ABS for the outer case, which can withstand 200 kg of force, the inner frame is all metal and has a crushproof rating of 441 pounds.\n\nThe tolerances on every aspect of the hardware are spot on, and the internals are well laid out and fabricated. I have zero complaints in this category.\n\nAccording to the Geekom site, the IT 15 uses Intel AI Boost, powered by an NPU delivering a peak of 13 TOPS (INT8). Naturally, with Ollama/Msty, I wasn't able to test text-to-image AI conversion (on top of which, I'm not keen on using AI for creating art), but I can safely say the CPU is powerful enough to do whatever you need.\n\nThis one is easy. If you're looking for a new PC, you don't have much space, and you don't want to sacrifice power, the Geekom IT15 Mini PC is a great buy at $1,100 on Amazon. If I had to replace my current System76 Thelio with a PC this size, you can bet I'd be happy utilizing the IT15. The cherry on top is that everything worked out of the box with Linux.\n\nAlso: This official Ubuntu Spin might just be the perfect intro to Linux\n\nIf you're a fan of small PCs, do yourself a favor and grab a Geekom IT15. You can use the default Windows 11 OS, install Linux over it, or dual-boot Linux and Windows to have the best of both worlds. It's a bargain and will outperform your expectations for most typical use cases.\n\u2022 Cooling - internal fan (which can get somewhat loud under heavy load)",

Once configured correctly, it runs like a dream with my 3 screens - 2 x 32\" Samsungs and 1 x 24\" LG in portrait mode. I have not used it for gaming, but for streaming and dev work it runs amazingly well - no lag or difference from my old i7-13900k gaming machine. The file transfer speeds are insanely fast, and I have several USB hubs with many peripherals running without any issues. All in all, it's mindblowing how much computing power is in such a small box.\nCONs:\nThere is a decent amount of configuration required to get it running seamlessly.\nFirst of all, the included HDMI cable would not connect to some of my displays, and the HDMI ports are fickle depending on the cables you are using. I ended up buying JSAUX and oldboytech cables from Amazon and I can confirm that both of those brands work, but several others I tried did not.\nSecondly, the default fan noise is really loud, even when it isn't under load. I had to go to the Geekom website and download a BIOS unlocker so that I could enter the BIOS and turn the thermal profile to quiet.\nLastly, the out-of-the-box drivers are out of date and need updating in order to get things working properly. I use three screens and could not get them all to connect at the right resolution until I downloaded the latest Intel Arc drivers from Intel. Similarly with the wireless and bluetooth, they were finicky until I downloaded and installed the latest drivers.\nConclusion:\nDon't get me wrong, this is a great little box, but it is not plug-and-play if you have specific setup requirements. That said, I would happily buy it again knowing what I know now, but it is the reason why it doesn't get a 5 star from me. I spent a good few hours of trial and error to get it running how I like it, but now I am very happy with it.\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2025Size: Ultra 9 285H, 32+2TBVerified PurchaseI purchased the IT15 which has the intel 9 285H processor. Fan noise is very high. considering the price of this product one would think that the fan would throttle well and better fan to minimize noise level. Even at idle the fan noise was loud and would not stop running. I also had difficulty connecting to my monitor using the HDMI cable given. It would not tightly attach to the HDMI port and sometimes would not connect to my monitor. Not sure if it is HDMI port or cheap cable. Lastly, I went to the website to request support on the fan throttling and HDMI issue on 6/29/25 and 6/30/35. I tried to contact them on chat. it said that they open at 9am EST. I contacted them on 11am and couldn't get anyone on chat. I also tried to email them on the website and received multiple server error and couldn't send email to them. The warranty is for up to 3year. Considering I couldn't contact them and HW issues with product during the first week of ownership on a product that cost over a thousand US dollars, it is very disappointing. I did run full defender online and offline scans as well as Mcafee scan and no malicious SW was found. there are concerns on the internet regarding security. I didn't find any issue but cannot vouch for BIOS level security concerns in short term and long term. I also wish they would use the same M.2 SSD port so that I can use the M2 ssd. M2 2242 ssd is more laptop format and not as popular as m2 2280 format. they should have used the M2 2242 ssd as primary and left the 2280 open for secondary drive in US destined products. When it worked it was loud but it worked. that is reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. Don't be duped by the positive reviews as most of the positive reviews are more than 2 years old and are not related to the current product IT15 which just came out.\nUpdate: 7/8/25 - I returned the product due to lack of support and issues with product. I received confirmation that the product was received at rma location on 7/2/25 yet Geekom hasn't refunded me. They keep sending me email asking if I want to keep the product and now they are asking me for evidence the product was returned even though they should have the same information that I have from amazon since I used amazon return process. They are absolutely the worst vendor to deal with if you have issue. 3yr warranty but can't get in touch with them and then when you return, they hassle you on getting a refund. I originally gave them 2 stars but changed to one star. Buyer beware. I may escalate to Amazon directly to get my money back. This is ridiculous.\nUpdate 7/10/25 - After multiple contact with Geekom, they finally processed my refund. Their response was that they do not receive information from Amazon of return so they couldn't refund me so they needed to contact me directly. They offered me a free USB switch for my troubles. I did not take up on the offer on the free product. Be careful to read the reviews as many of the reviews are not related to the current product. There after purchase support is non-existent. They didn't disagree with my comment regarding the difficulty in contacting them. They only said they would look into it which validates that they were having issues or they don't really have customer support available in USA. Either case, it is bad when they provide 3yr non-existent support and warranty. At least I got my money back after multiple exchanges with them. Buyer beware.\nUpdate 7/26/25 - Since I posted the comment about reviews that didn't match the product, they have removed all the reviews that was not relevant to the IT15.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2025Size: Ultra 9 285H, 32+2TBVerified PurchaseThe TI15 was delivered on time and installed like a dream. Its performance speed is blazing. It connected to the WiFi with no problems. The cost was much less than a comparable desktop computer, and its size is actually smaller than my external backup drive. I have no problem giving it a 5 star rating.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2025Size: Ultra 9 285H, 32+2TBVerified PurchaseLove my new small and fast computer!\nI have three monitors hooked up and multitask a lot. Lightening fast response and is so small it comes with a mounting bracket so I can mount it to the back of my middle monitor if I wanted to. Seems to be built like a little brick house.

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI replaced my Samsung OLED TV with this Sony Mini LED model for a week - and didn't regret it\nSony Bravia 5 TV (98-inch)\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Enhanced color, contrast, and clarity make this TV live up to its hype.\n- It handily delivers upscaled HDR content and high-speed footage.\n- A soundbar will complement its size, and its off-angle viewing can be less than perfect.\nSony recently sent us the 2025 Bravia 5 TV, this one with a 98-inch screen and weighing in at 158 pounds. It goes without saying that this TV is a beast -- an expensive one. And the Bravia 5 is not even considered the company's flagship model (you can look to the Bravia 8 II and Bravia 9 for that). But this TV is impressive, and after testing it for a week, I'll explain why.\nAlso: You should turn off this default TV setting ASAP - and why even experts recommend it\nThe Bravia 5 is a Google TV, so setting up the UI was fairly easy using the remote and the Google Home app on my phone. But be prepared for a series of screens requiring you to check boxes for privacy disclaimers. The era of streaming content has become very complicated.\nOtherwise, the interface is intuitive, offering quick access to a vast selection of streaming services, apps, and voice control capabilities via Google Assistant. The personalization features are also a plus for helping you discover new content.\nThis behemoth of a display comes with a relatively small remote control. It's slender and lightweight, and if you have fat fingers like me, you might accidentally press enter when you meant to press a navigation button.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has an underrated feature that can revitalize an old system for free\nI appreciate the downsizing of remotes across most brands these days. Yet despite all the streamlining, Sony (and most others) insist on including dedicated app buttons. You know, for Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and whatever other platforms the manufacturer contracts with. These buttons take up a lot of real estate and make the remote seem almost \"disposable\" because brands get bought, sold, and sometimes change names.\nFor example, I have a Roku TV with a Vudu button. Who or what is Vudu? That platform still exists, but it's now known as Fandango Media (a joint venture between NBC Universal and Warner Bros.).\nI don't mean to make an example of Sony; its engineers are simply abiding by the current trend. Yet, I haven't met anyone who says they use these dedicated app buttons. When you have a smartly designed home screen, you don't need them.\nThat is one of my two peevish critiques of the Sony Bravia 5. Second is the fact that this remote is not backlit. Come on, Sony. If I'm buying a $6,000 TV, I envision a home cinema experience in the dark (just like in a movie theatre). This means I don't want to turn on my phone to aim a light source at the \"magic wand\" just so I can pause the thing when my DoorDash order arrives. To me, backlighting on remotes seems like a simple ask for anything above a budget model television.\nApologies for my digressionary rant on remote control design. Despite these minor gripes, it became clear to me that the Bravia 5 has plenty to shout about.\nAlso: The next big HDMI leap has arrived - how the 2.2 standard is shaking things up\nFor one thing, Sony's prowess in display technology is impressive. Its proprietary Cognitive Processor XR upscales images beautifully, ensuring motion is slippery smooth with minimal blur. From fast-paced action scenes in the 2023 Mission: Impossible rendition to 2025 NBA highlights, the Bravia 5 delivered 4K resolution with exceptional clarity, vibrant colors, and impressive contrast. HDR content truly pops, showcasing deep blacks and brilliant highlights.\nWhile 4K content looks phenomenal, lower-resolution content (like older cable broadcasts) tends to reveal imperfections more noticeably on such a large screen, even with the XR processor's excellent upscaling.\nThe Sony Bravia 5 can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate with VRR and ALLM enabled, which means the TV dynamically adjusts to match the frame rate of the content being displayed. This is especially good news for gamers. With those kinds of specs, playing Fortnite on a display of this size is an electrifying experience. The Bravia 5 showed no sign of screen tearing, with exquisitely responsive gameplay.\nAlso: The best Sony TVs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nAlready impressed by the images on this behemoth TV, I ran a few tests at the lab for dirty screen effect, burn-in, and blooming. I clocked no degradation, even close to the edges. The color test was consistent; the subtitle test yielded no visible blooming, and the scrolling text motion was liquid.\nHaving said that, viewing the Bravia 5 from side angles was not the best. It's fair to assume that, with the same build and technology in a smaller Bravia 5, this would also be the case. With a 98-inch screen, though, you probably won't get many complaints from someone sitting on the far edge of your couch. And while Sony TVs generally handle reflections well, a screen this large can still be susceptible to glare in brightly lit rooms, so strategic placement and light control are important factors. (You might consider getting some blackout curtains.)\nAlso: I changed 12 settings on my Apple TV to instantly improve the performance\nThis Mini LED TV bears a peak brightness of around 800 nits. That isn't eye-popping OLED-level brightness, but in a dark room, you might want to lower the brightness on a Bravia 5 to prevent eye strain. Trust me, the TV is plenty bright, and it can accommodate seating from any conceivable home theater.\nWhat about sound? The Sony Bravia 5 uses Sony's Acoustic Multi-Audio system, and it's worth some praise. It combines two down-firing X-Balanced speakers for bass and midrange with a pair of Sound Positioning tweeters on the top corners of the back panel to handle mids and highs. The result is a well-balanced listening experience, with clear dialogue and vocals complemented by ambient effects that fill the space nicely.\nFor the ultimate audio experience, though, the Sony Bravia 5 could use a companion soundbar to round things out. Again, if you're investing this much in a giant screen, then your budget might not be too far stretched to install a comprehensive surround sound system as well.\nAlso: This is the soundbar I recommend for deeply immersive audio - and now it's $300 off\nThe Bravia 5 has an impressive array of connectivity options, including Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 on the wireless side, and several physical ports. I really like how Sony included an infographic panel (of sorts) right next to each port to make it clear which cables go where. It comes with four HDMI ports -- one of them eARC (for that soundbar you should buy), another being 4K at 120Hz (for your online gaming needs).\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe 98-inch Sony Bravia 5 is a formidable piece of home entertainment technology. Its stunning picture quality, immersive scale, and excellent smart features make it a dream display for any cinephile or gaming enthusiast.\nGrand proportions notwithstanding, Sony's quality will shine through on any smaller-sized Bravia 5 screen. This one runs for about $5,999, whereas you can get an 85-inch Bravia 5 for less than half that price or a 75-inch for one-third the cost.\nEven if it's not about the money, not every home can accommodate a colossal 98-inch panel. So, if your home's parameters aren't suitable for something this big, you'll arguably be getting a better value by downsizing a step or two on screen size.\nIf you have the budget and space, the Bravia 5 delivers on its promise of a magnificent viewing experience. And if you're seeking the ultimate home cinema experience, pair this TV with a high-end soundbar to match the visual grandeur with equally powerful and nuanced audio.\nHow we test TVs\nWhile testing and researching the TVs featured on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind:\n- Price: Not all budgets are created equal. And if you're working with a limited budget, that shouldn't mean you have to settle for a sub-par TV.\n- Screen size: The most important factor to consider, after price, when shopping for a new TV is whether or not it will fit into your space.\n- Picture and audio quality: A new TV doesn't mean much, even if it costs an arm and a leg, if it doesn't provide a great picture and clear audio. The best TVs we test have often been ensured to support various HDR codecs, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, as well as enhanced audio software like Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, and object-tracking sound.\nFor a more detailed look, check out our extensive TV testing methodology."

      "text": "This official Ubuntu Spin might just be the perfect intro to Linux\nThere are so many Linux distributions that claim to be the best for those looking to try out the open source operating system. Many of them, such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Deepin Linux, and Elementary OS, are very well designed for that very purpose. They all offer unique takes on Linux and each has some special to offer.\nBut there's a lesser-known, official Ubuntu spin that really hits all the marks for new users. That distribution is Ubuntu Budgie. Not only is this take on the Linux desktop very user-friendly, but it's also quite beautiful as well.\nAlso: The best Linux laptops right now\nOne of the things I really appreciate about Ubuntu Budgie is how it seems to take nods from so many other desktop interfaces and rolls them into one. It's part Pantheon, GNOME, KDE, and Cinnamon coming together to make something completely unique and easy to use.\nAt the heart of Ubuntu Budgie is the Budgie desktop, which started as the official desktop of the EvolveOS, created by Ikey Doherty. Doherty eventually renamed his OS to Solus, with the intention of using GNOME components to create a more traditional UI.\nEventually, Doherty left the project but Budgie continued on. Now, Budgie has become the centerpiece of the official Ubuntu Spin and, according to the official website, is \"friendly to newcomers from other Operating Systems, programmers and normal users alike.\"\nAlso: Thinking about switching to Linux? 6 things you need to know\nThe development team is certainly backing up that statement. I'm always on the lookout for Linux distributions that are ideal for new users and with the release of Ubuntu Budgie 23.04, I can wholeheartedly say that this distribution might be the perfect introduction to Linux. It has the simple underpinnings of Ubuntu (including Snap packages), and a UI that makes working with Linux as easy as using Windows or MacOS.\nAlso: How to replace Windows with Linux Mint on your PC\nFrom the second you log in, and are greeted by the Budgie Welcome app, you feel right at home. And whether you've spent most of your years using MacOS or Windows, you'll immediately feel at ease.\nThe beautiful UI\nThe default Ubuntu Budgie desktop includes a desktop menu at the top left corner, a system tray and notification section at the top right, and a dock at the bottom edge of the display.\nAlso: XeroLinux could be the most beautiful Linux desktop on the market\nYou'll also find a fancy calendar/media control sidebar that slides out from the right edge of the desktop. Click the left-pointing arrow at the top right corner to reveal the sidebar, where you can see your calendar, control media playback, and check your notifications.\nClick the desktop menu button at the top left corner to reveal all of the apps installed.\nThis reminds me very much of the Elementary OS menu with an extra trick up its sleeve. If you prefer a more traditional categorized menu, click the right icon in the upper left corner of the open menu and the layout will shift to make it easier for those who prefer all of their apps brought together in related categories.\nPre-installed Software\nFor those who like to know what they are getting into before they try something new, here's a quick list of the applications that ship with Ubuntu Budgie:\n- Firefox web browser\n- Goodvibes internet radio player\n- gPodder Podcast Client\n- LibreOffice\n- Lollypop audio player\n- Thunderbird email client\nIf there's an app missing, you can simply open the Software app and install anything you need (including Snap apps, such as Spotify and Slack).\nTiling capabilities\nAlthough I'm not a big fan of strict tiling window managers, I do regularly use window snapping. For those that aren't familiar with window snapping, it's the ability to \"snap\" a window to a specific portion of the desktop. Typically, desktop operating systems allow you to easily snap a window to the left or right half of the desktop, snap it to full screen, or the top or bottom half of the display. This makes it very handy to work with windows side-by-side without having to manually adjust their position and size.\nAlso: How to get true window snapping in MacOS\nWith Ubuntu Budgie, you can snap windows to take up either horizontal or vertical halves or you can snap one window to each corner to take up a quarter of the screen. With a large enough display, this feature can help take your multitasking to new heights. Of course, with a smaller display (such as when using Ubuntu Budgie in a virtual machine), that can get a bit cramped.\nMy only dislike is the dark theme\u2026but that's a very personal thing. I've never been a fan of dark themes, so it's generally the first thing I change on my desktop. Ubuntu Budgie makes that easy with the Budgie Welcome app. Click Makeovers & Layouts, scroll through the Appearance tab until you find a design you like, and click either Apply Makeover or Install. There aren't a lot of Makeovers & Layouts to choose from, but you'll probably find one you like.\nShould you try Ubuntu Budgie?\nIf you're looking for a new desktop operating system that is as simple as it is beautiful, one that won't get in your way, challenge your skillset, or limit you, Ubuntu Budgie is a great option. In fact, I've become so smitten during my testing period, I'm considering making the switch myself (from Pop!_OS).\nAlso: The best Linux distros for beginners\nDownload an ISO of Ubuntu Budgie, create a bootable USB drive, and install the OS on a spare machine to see if you have the same reaction to this open source operating system."

Such computers exist, but not all of them are created equal.\nI've tested plenty of these tiny form-factor PCs, and a lot of them might be cute, but they lack any semblance of power to do much. Others, like the Piccolo N150 -- an eight-inch device I recently reviewed -- are useful in specific contexts but aren't for everyone. Because of this, any time I receive one for review, I go into the review process with a grain of salt.\nAlso: Prime Day is over, but you can still shop some of our favorite laptop deals on MacBooks and more\nImagine my surprise when I opened the palm-sized Minix Neo Z97 and realized my assumptions might very well be wrong.\nMinix is a company you might never have heard of, but they create quite a lot of small form-factor hardware, such as PCs, car touchscreens, portable monitors, chargers, and wireless displays. Minix's products often impress and are offered at affordable prices. For instance, its new Z97 Mini PC sells for only $226 on Amazon.\nIs it worth the price? Let's find out.\nMy experience\nFirst off, the Neo Z97 shipped with Windows 11, and I decided against installing Linux over it. Since Windows 11 is a resource hog, I thought it would be best to see how well the hardware handled the OS first. Sure, I could install a Linux distribution on the PC, knowing it would vastly outperform Windows, but this time around I wanted to experience the default.\nAlso: This Linux distro makes openSUSE accessible to all - even newbies should take a look\nAs with Windows 11, the initial setup was time-consuming and inferior to any Linux distribution I've ever used. But this isn't a debate about Linux vs. Windows (because you know where I stand on that); this is all about the PC itself.\nOnce the setup was completed, I ran the tiny PC through what would be my normal daily routine, including installing LibreOffice, launching Ollama/Msty, browsing the web, and watching videos on YouTube.\nAs far as everyday tasks go, the New Z97 performed far better than I expected from such a tiny machine. LibreOffice opened quickly, editing images with GIMP was painless, websites loaded as fast as they would on my main desktop PC, and YouTube videos and music on Spotify played without issue.\nThe most resource-intensive task was Ollama/Msty (because local AI can gobble up system resources), and it pushed the Z97 to its limits. To be fair, Ollama/Msty pushes my System76 Thelio (an absolute beast of a computer), so I was not at all surprised that this mini PC struggled a bit with the local AI. If the machine included a dedicated GPU, that might not be the case, but, as is, it's not exactly designed for localized AI usage.\nAlso: The best mini PCs you can buy\nOne thing that did surprise me was how quiet the Z97 is. I didn't hear the fan kick in once (even during the initial upgrade of Windows 11). It's completely silent. I had to hold my ear up to the device to finally hear the fan whirring.\nZDNET's buying advice\nI realize the inclination for such small PCs tends to lean toward kiosks or desks with very little room, but you'd be mistaken if you thought the Minix Neo Z97 should be limited to such deployments. This tiny machine is powerful enough for everyday use. And if you need a triple monitor setup, the Z97 has you covered, which means this little beast can do some serious work.\nAlso: 5 of the easiest, quickest Linux distros to install - and I've tried them all\nDon't be fooled by its size; the Z97 can serve as your desktop computer with ease and grace. It might not be the most powerful machine I've ever used (that would be my System76 Thelio), but it's a far cry from the low end, and at $226 on Amazon, it's a steal.\nMinix Neo Z97 Mini PC tech specs\n- CPU - Intel\u00ae Processor N97 (6MB cache, up to 3.6 GHz)\n- GPU - Intel\u00ae UHD Graphics\n- Memory - 12GB LPDDR5X-4800MHz (Onboard)\n- Storage - 512GB M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 x 4 NVMe SSD\n- Storage Slot - M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 x 1 NVMe Slot.\n- Ethernet Chipset - 2 x RJ-45 1G Ethernet\n- Connectivity - M.2 2230 Intel\u00ae 802.11AX Dual Band WIFI 6 (2.4GHz/5GHz), BT5.2\n- Ports - HDMI Port: 2 x HDMI2.1 TMDS 4K@60Hz, DP Port: 1 x DP1.4 4K@60Hz, 3 x USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, 1 x Input AC 100~240V, Output 12V 3A 36W Max, DC 2.5/5.5mm, 1 x Audio Output Combo Jack, and 2 x RJ-45 1G Ethernet.\n- OS - Windows 11\n- Size - 88\u00d788\u00d742mm\n- Weight - 0.18kg"

TCL's Nxtpaper technology offers a paper-like screen that's made for tired eyes like mine. The TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G is the company's affordable attempt at relieving some of the stress that comes from modern smartphone screens.\nAlso: Changing this Android setting instantly doubled my phone speed (Samsung and Google models included)\nIt's a unique trick for a very inexpensive smartphone that needs to be seen to be understood. While far from perfect, and definitely a device built to a price, it brings a differentiator that will matter for some users looking to give their eyes a rest while they scroll or read.\nA unique multi-faceted display\nThe display is what immediately sets the 60XE apart. TCL's Nxtpaper 3.0 matte coating gives the glass an undeniably unique finish that I quite like. On-screen content looks a bit like E-ink depending on the mode the phone is in, but underneath that hazy layer is a standard 1080p, 120Hz LCD panel.\nThe coating addresses a slew of common downsides of modern displays. It reduces blue light, cuts reflections to nearly nothing, and even eliminates most fingerprints. There's also a nice texture that feels a bit like paper, which is a nice departure from a sea of glossy, reflective displays.\nBeneath the power and volume buttons is a physical Nxtpaper Key, a plastic switch that feels a bit cheaper than I'd like. Flipping the switch offers up a menu of distinct modes that change how the display operates.\nTCL clearly wants users to notice and appreciate this feature because every toggle results in a five-second full-screen animation complete with an obnoxious serenade. I made sure to set my volume to mute so I could avoid the theatrical effect.\nEach mode provides its own twist on usability and comfort. Color Paper Mode, my favorite, mutes the colors while retaining a standard Android interface that's easier on the eyes for all-day use. I even enjoyed watching YouTube videos in this mode, though everything feels a bit flatter than my eyes are used to.\nInk Paper Mode goes one step further, stripping color from icons and text for a no-frills grayscale approach, while still delivering the full unencumbered Android experience. Max Ink Mode is the most dramatic change, stripping all color while also limiting apps to a small subset of essentials and suspending certain background processes.\nAlso: iOS 26 envy? 5 iPhone features you can already use on your Android (Samsung included)\nThe result is an ultra-minimal, battery-saving mode that can last more than a week on a single charge. I enjoyed this mode for reading ebooks and could see it as a great solution for users looking to cut back on smartphone use entirely.\nThe display does come with a major caveat. On the brightest days, the matte finish would all but wash out on-screen content, often making it unusable in direct sunlight. If you spend time outside reading or working, you'll be looking for shade like I was.\nPerformance and battery\nPerformance is modest but serviceable, with a MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ processor inside paired with 8GB of RAM. In use, this is not a phone for hardcore users who push their devices to the limit. I noticed many actions have a slight delay attached to them. Launching the camera often takes a few seconds to negotiate.\nGeneral tasks like web browsing, email, and messaging are responsive enough to keep me happy, but things never felt snappy.\nOn the software front, the 60 XE runs Android 15, with a promise from TCL of just one upgrade to Android 16 and two years of security patches. As someone who always decries the poor state of Android OS update promises, this is a weak point, and TCL needs to step up its game. Anyone hoping to get long-term value should consider other options.\nAlso: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\nI found battery life to be a highlight, which isn't that surprising given the 5,010mAh battery hidden inside. I routinely made it through the day with around 20-30% capacity to spare at bedtime. Wired charging tops out at a slow 18 watts, so quick daytime top-ups will take some time, but it's fine for plugging in overnight.\nFor the truly battery paranoid, there's the Max Ink Mode that considerably jumps battery life to more than a week if you are willing to cut down on much of what the phone is capable of.\nStay for the display, but not the camera\nThe plastic marble-like backplate surrounds a large circular camera array that's hard to miss and perhaps even more premium-looking than its price point. One pet peeve of mine is an off-center camera module, and this phone has a notable wobble when placed on a tabletop as a result.\nThe camera system itself is one area where the low-end cutbacks really show. The main sensor does its best outdoors in very bright conditions and needs a lot of light to help shots taken indoors. The camera performance is mediocre with soft output that lacks punch and definition most of the time.\nLow-light conditions easily demonstrate the camera system's baseline capability, and the ultrawide lens often results in grainy images. The 32MP front camera works, but that's about it. Let's just say that this is not the phone for the discerning camera buff.\nZDNET's buying advice\nWhat the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G offers is a key standout feature: a unique matte display. At $250, the 60XE offers something that you really can't find anywhere else, in this price category and beyond, and the benefits of that might matter a lot for certain users. For everyone else, consider phones like the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which offers better imaging, better speed, and its signature modular design approach.\nFollow my latest tech reviews and projects across social media.

Once configured correctly, it runs like a dream with my 3 screens - 2 x 32\" Samsungs and 1 x 24\" LG in portrait mode. I have not used it for gaming, but for streaming and dev work it runs amazingly well - no lag or difference from my old i7-13900k gaming machine. The file transfer speeds are insanely fast, and I have several USB hubs with many peripherals running without any issues. All in all, it's mindblowing how much computing power is in such a small box.\nCONs:\nThere is a decent amount of configuration required to get it running seamlessly.\nFirst of all, the included HDMI cable would not connect to some of my displays, and the HDMI ports are fickle depending on the cables you are using. I ended up buying JSAUX and oldboytech cables from Amazon and I can confirm that both of those brands work, but several others I tried did not.\nSecondly, the default fan noise is really loud, even when it isn't under load. I had to go to the Geekom website and download a BIOS unlocker so that I could enter the BIOS and turn the thermal profile to quiet.\nLastly, the out-of-the-box drivers are out of date and need updating in order to get things working properly. I use three screens and could not get them all to connect at the right resolution until I downloaded the latest Intel Arc drivers from Intel. Similarly with the wireless and bluetooth, they were finicky until I downloaded and installed the latest drivers.\nConclusion:\nDon't get me wrong, this is a great little box, but it is not plug-and-play if you have specific setup requirements. That said, I would happily buy it again knowing what I know now, but it is the reason why it doesn't get a 5 star from me. I spent a good few hours of trial and error to get it running how I like it, but now I am very happy with it.\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2025Size: Ultra 9 285H, 32+2TBVerified PurchaseI purchased the IT15 which has the intel 9 285H processor. Fan noise is very high. considering the price of this product one would think that the fan would throttle well and better fan to minimize noise level. Even at idle the fan noise was loud and would not stop running. I also had difficulty connecting to my monitor using the HDMI cable given. It would not tightly attach to the HDMI port and sometimes would not connect to my monitor. Not sure if it is HDMI port or cheap cable. Lastly, I went to the website to request support on the fan throttling and HDMI issue on 6/29/25 and 6/30/35. I tried to contact them on chat. it said that they open at 9am EST. I contacted them on 11am and couldn't get anyone on chat. I also tried to email them on the website and received multiple server error and couldn't send email to them. The warranty is for up to 3year. Considering I couldn't contact them and HW issues with product during the first week of ownership on a product that cost over a thousand US dollars, it is very disappointing. I did run full defender online and offline scans as well as Mcafee scan and no malicious SW was found. there are concerns on the internet regarding security. I didn't find any issue but cannot vouch for BIOS level security concerns in short term and long term. I also wish they would use the same M.2 SSD port so that I can use the M2 ssd. M2 2242 ssd is more laptop format and not as popular as m2 2280 format. they should have used the M2 2242 ssd as primary and left the 2280 open for secondary drive in US destined products. When it worked it was loud but it worked. that is reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. Don't be duped by the positive reviews as most of the positive reviews are more than 2 years old and are not related to the current product IT15 which just came out.\nUpdate: 7/8/25 - I returned the product due to lack of support and issues with product. I received confirmation that the product was received at rma location on 7/2/25 yet Geekom hasn't refunded me. They keep sending me email asking if I want to keep the product and now they are asking me for evidence the product was returned even though they should have the same information that I have from amazon since I used amazon return process. They are absolutely the worst vendor to deal with if you have issue. 3yr warranty but can't get in touch with them and then when you return, they hassle you on getting a refund. I originally gave them 2 stars but changed to one star. Buyer beware. I may escalate to Amazon directly to get my money back. This is ridiculous.\nUpdate 7/10/25 - After multiple contact with Geekom, they finally processed my refund. Their response was that they do not receive information from Amazon of return so they couldn't refund me so they needed to contact me directly. They offered me a free USB switch for my troubles. I did not take up on the offer on the free product. Be careful to read the reviews as many of the reviews are not related to the current product. There after purchase support is non-existent. They didn't disagree with my comment regarding the difficulty in contacting them. They only said they would look into it which validates that they were having issues or they don't really have customer support available in USA. Either case, it is bad when they provide 3yr non-existent support and warranty. At least I got my money back after multiple exchanges with them. Buyer beware.\nUpdate 7/26/25 - Since I posted the comment about reviews that didn't match the product, they have removed all the reviews that was not relevant to the IT15.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2025Size: Ultra 9 285H, 32+2TBVerified PurchaseThe TI15 was delivered on time and installed like a dream. Its performance speed is blazing. It connected to the WiFi with no problems. The cost was much less than a comparable desktop computer, and its size is actually smaller than my external backup drive.

The electronics have improved, but the basic act of operating a digital camera has remained mostly the same. Cameras are a gaggle of buttons that are a cryptic arrangement to anyone but the initiated.\nThe real innovation in the picture-taking experience has been the smartphone, which has made picture-taking an always-available tool for documenting everything with relative ease.\nThere is still an audience, however, for innovation beyond what smartphones offer. Young consumers keep buying digital cameras, and a new generation is always interested to learn more about photography as an art.\nAlso: The best vlogging cameras of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nInto the void steps lens and camera maker Sigma Corp., based in Kanagawa, Japan, just outside Tokyo. The company this spring introduced a radical redesign of the digital camera's basic mode of use.\nThe Sigma BF, as it's called, reduces the mass of buttons to a small set of touch-sensitive controls. All the functions of digital photography are still there to be experimented with and exploited -- shutter speed, lens aperture, or \"f-stop,\" and \"ISO,\" the level of light that can be recovered from a scene -- but they are under your command in a radically simplified user interface.\nI've been testing the BF for some weeks now, and I'm smitten with the changes. The hardware's design is beautiful, and the new user interface is very thoughtful. The name \"BF\" stands for \"beautiful foolishness,\" and you could say this kind of redesign is crazy, but I love it.\nA camera for a new age of photographers\nSigma, a sixty-three-year-old company, makes most of its money from lenses for all camera brands. As a result, its cameras have tended to be somewhat experimental, never selling in the same volume as Sony, Canon, or Nikon. That means that the company takes chances. Often, the results are wild and beautiful.\nThe BF is really meant for a new age of prosumers who want to up their game in photography. At a retail price of $2,199, the price is not insignificant, but it is on the low end for what you'd pay for a very good 35mm digital camera these days. Lenses, which have to be bought separately, run from about $600 for a fixed focal length \"prime\" lens to $1,300 or more for zoom lenses. The BF uses what's called an \"L-mount,\" which means you're not limited to Sigma's lenses; it's also compatible with lenses from Leica, Panasonic, Samyang, and Sirui.\nAlso: Eufy's latest security camera has AI-powered color night vision - and no monthly fees\nThe premise of stepping up your game from the smartphone camera is pretty simple, to my mind: You will never, ever, get as good a picture with any smartphone camera as you will with a camera that has a real lens. The lens is the key. The optics are just so superior to the optics on a smartphone.\nI tested the BF with a 50mm prime lens from Sigma, the same kind I already use for most of my photography.\nNo matter what you are photographing, there are immediate benefits to using a real camera versus a smartphone camera.\nOne benefit is the detail you get. Here's a picture of a butterfly landing on some vegetation in a vivarium. When cropping the image to see the butterfly up close, you'll get a level of detail that is clean rather than the murky detail you get even with a smartphone's optical zoom:\n(None of these photos have been edited. They are all straight out of the camera. In some cases, the file size has been compressed to accommodate the publishing system.)\nNot only detail but also control of the depth of field via the aperture dial on the lens provides control over the selective blurring of objects, the \"bokeh.\"\nSmartphones will give you fake bokeh that is generated in software rather than the actual bending of the light via the lens elements. Rarely will fake bokeh give you a really complex, thrilling effect where both foreground and background elements are selectively blurred, leading to a more sophisticated image, such as this cypress I snapped in New York's Central Park:\nAnd even when fake bokeh works, I don't think you'll achieve the almost holographic, floating beauty you get with a real lens while preserving all the detail of the foreground subject, as with this thistle:\nThe second advantage is that a real lens will give you more real proportions than a smartphone lens that has a lot of barrel distortion. Like a building architectural shot or this bank vault:\nYou can get a nice, crisp skyline shot at twilight as the light changes:\nA swing to simplicity\nWhere the BF departs from other cameras is in the simplicity of design and user interface.\nThe hardware is, very simply, a solid shell milled from a block of aluminum and then filled with electronics. It's a gorgeous manufactured object with a super solid feel. (Sigma cameras always feel super solid, but this is on a new level.)\nThe BF's body is one of the lightest full-frame mirrorless cameras on the market, at just under a pound, compared to devices such as the Sony a7 IV, which weighs nearly a pound and a half.\nFor non-camera users, the weight of any real camera is something of a surprise compared to a smartphone such as an Apple iPhone Pro, which weighs half a pound. Holding 15 ounces worth of an unfamiliar object prompted some people to whom I handed the BF to remark, \"It's so heavy!\"\nAlso: First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes\nThe total weight of the camera is the combination of the 15 ounces and the 12 ounces of the 50mm Sigma lens. That kind of heft is typical of full-frame lenses because they have a lot of glass inside them. (And this particular Sigma lens is not very heavy as 50-millimeter lenses go.)\nThe real adjustment for a novice photographer is getting used to the balance of weight between camera and lens versus carrying a slab of a smartphone with uniform weight distribution.\nThe camera comes in two finishes, a striking silver color and a deep black. I chose to try the black as I like to use the camera often in discreet settings such as a jazz club, so I wanted something less flashy than the silver.\nThe sensor is a full-frame, 35mm Sony chip with just under 25 megapixels, less than the 60 megapixels in some 35mm cameras. Despite a lower pixel count, I found the sensor produced rich detail, certainly enough for Instagram pictures and possibly good enough for wall-sized prints depending on the exposure. Sony is a very reliable name for sensors, so it makes sense for Sigma to go with the market leader.\nImages are stored in the internal 230-gigabyte flash memory, which I found to be more than enough for my purposes. I usually offloaded the pictures onto my iPad or MacBook after each photo-taking session via USB-C and then cleared the BF's memory.\nAlso: Why the best fix for headless server frustration might be a little box named Comet\nOn the software side, the radical simplification of the user interface is striking -- it's even something of a revelation.\nI've been a user of Sigma cameras for over a decade, my main camera these days being the Sigma fp-L, a 60-megapixel model introduced a couple of years ago. I love that camera, but I would be very happy to see the changes in the BF user interface become standard on Sigma cameras going forward.\nThe main innovation is removing a lot of shooting information from the LCD screen. Instead of seeing the aperture or shutter speed and other settings constantly on the display, each setting on the BF occupies a separate, tiny LCD -- it's called a \"status monitor\" though I tend to think of it as simply a \"mini-LCD\" -- to the right of the main display.\nA click wheel just below the mini-LCD, formally called the \"dial pad,\" reminiscent of the first Apple iPod's click wheel, lets you rotate through the values of shutter speed, etc. The changing values are displayed on the mini-LCD as you do so, and you click the center button of the click wheel to select the setting you want.\nThere's also a touch-sensitive playback button, so you can peek at what you just snapped with a soft touch, and a touch-sensitive menu button, which is a quick way to peek at the camera's settings. And a power button at the bottom of all this, of course.\nThe effect is that the main display screen is a pristine window into what you're capturing in the real world, while the mini-LCD and the click-wheel are your controls. It's a nice division that elegantly separates the gaze from the adjustments.\nThe main LCD is a 2.1 megapixel model and is terrifically responsive for things such as selecting the focus area by tapping with your finger, or using pinch and swipe when looking through the photos you've taken.\nAlso: Stanford's holographic AI glasses are coming for your clunky VR headset\nIf you half-press the shutter button, the display momentarily shows the key settings before you fully commit to the shutter release. If you press on the center button of the click-wheel, or dial pad, extra settings come up for the function that's in focus, such as shutter speed.\nStreet photography delight\nThe BF's light weight and simplified user interface made for nice street photography, one of my favorite pastimes.\nI tended to carry the camera at my waist in one hand, holding onto the lens, sometimes with the camera body flipped upside-down, with my pinky finger on the shutter button. That way, I achieved a kind of nonchalant pose that did not draw attention to my picture-taking.\nAlso: I used Google's photo-to-video AI tool on my selfie - and it made me do the tango\nSometimes, I looked at the LCD to see what I was snapping, but oftentimes, I just took a picture in the general direction to see what chance would produce.\nThe autofocus function of the BF was super fast, notably faster than the response time of the fp-L, probably because of the BF's lower-megapixel-count sensor. That made for excellent motion capture, such as this basketball game:\nOne of the BF's shortcomings is having an electronic shutter: Instead of mechanical blades opening and closing, the sensor chip controls in software when the exposure happens. The common knock against an electronic shutter is that it can lead to blurring of fast motion. In the case of the basketball game, in late afternoon daylight, I saw no issue.\nAnother potential drawback is that indoors, in artificial light, the electronic shutter can produce dark bands across the image if the shutter speed is too fast. That can require you to take the picture at a slower shutter speed. In practice, I found it not to be much of a problem.\nImproved electronics\nIn addition to autofocus speed, Sigma has done a very good job with the BF's low-light support, which was already quite good on the fp-L.\nOne of my favorite low-light picture tests is a diorama in the North American mammals hall of the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. This is one of the darkest exhibits in the museum, and it's challenging to photograph if you don't have the camera resting on a tripod to allow for a long exposure.\nAlso: Why ads are coming to your favorite AI bots and you've only got yourself to blame\nTwo taxidermy wolves run on a painted landscape of the Michigan countryside. To the naked eye, the diorama is very, very dark because it is meant to suggest nighttime on the prairie. Here's what it typically looks like, taken with minimal low-light support by the BF:\nMost museum visitors who view the diorama turn on their smartphone camera's flash to take a souvenir shot. But, to my mind, flooding the scene with flash spoils the effect.\nInstead, I cranked up the BF to its highest ISO setting, 102,400 -- fairly high up there for any digital camera. The result is that the wolves emerge in beautiful detail from the darkness -- not as sharp or clean as if the scene were well-lighted, but that's the point:\nIn practice, the BF does a very nice job in darkly lit spaces where you might actually want a picture, such as a jazz club.\nWhen set on a tripod with professional lighting and a backdrop, the BF is also excellent for formal portraits, far better than what you'll get using a smartphone camera for your headshots.\nEven without using a macro lens, the 50mm will allow you to get pretty good closeup shots of something like your favorite toy, from a minimum distance of 18 inches, which you can then crop and still have lots of vivid detail.\nOf course, you could also add a macro lens to the BF and get even closer.\nA gentle introduction to pro features\nSigma has simplified some of the functions for newbies so that the same technical effects are present but in a more inviting fashion. For example, on the Sigma fp-L, a separate button is for \"tone control\" that lets you adjust the light across the scene by degrees for shadows and highlights to make a scene have more or less contrast.\nOn the BF, there's no button for tone control, but when selecting colors with the click-wheel, you can bump up or down values of \"highlight,\" \"shadow,\" and \"fade,\" to alter the degrees of lights and darks. That works in both still images and videos.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nThere's also an option called \"look effect,\" where you can dial up or down how vivid or how flat a given color filter is, which is a nice, obvious way to understand making your pictures or videos more striking or more sedate.\nIn practice, the BF does a great job with tone and exposure on automatic. A street scene at sunset, for example, nicely balances the vivid highlights of the sky with the street detail without blown highlights or detail lost in the shadows.\nWhen you review photos, the main LCD display gives you all the information on the tone adjustments you made, which is helpful for determining what works and what doesn't.\nSome things that are typically buried in sub-menus on digital cameras are brought forward in the BF's UI.\nSo, for example, when filming a movie, you have the option to turn on \"constant AF,\" which does a better job of grabbing hold of a new subject entering the frame. That is now an option from the click-wheel rather than being buried as a sub-menu option.\nOf course, there are trade-offs to simplicity. Other functions that were accessed directly via dedicated buttons on digital cameras become things you have to hunt for.\nFor example, auto-exposure lock forces the camera to keep the amount of light in the scene the same as you move it, rather than altering the exposure. This allows you to find the right balance of light and dark and hold onto it while you shift your focus.\nAlso: The 10 apps I can't live or work without - on Windows, Mac, and mobile\nOn the fp-L, auto-exposure lock has its own button. In the BF, you have to move the click wheel to the exposure section of the menus and then turn on auto-exposure lock by tapping on the icon. This extra step is fine if you don't use auto-exposure lock much.\nAnother example is a feature of most digital cameras called fill light, the ability to lighten up dark parts of a picture. On most cameras, you have an option to turn on the fill light while you're taking pictures. On the BF, fill light is something you adjust after the fact by editing the DNG, \"digital negative,\" or \"RAW,\" image in the camera.\nSigma's suggestion overall is to use color and filter adjustments to achieve a similar effect to fill light. In other words, the user interface consolidates traditional operations such as fill light and auto-exposure lock into a simpler set of choices that can be more centrally manipulated.\nAnd some things are just different. On the fp-L, and most cameras, when recording a video, you can take a still image as you're recording. On the BF, if you want a still image as well, you do it when replaying the video, by selecting \"save as JPEG.\"\nHow it performs with video\nSpeaking of video, I found the results were very satisfying. You can take 6K video (6,016 x 3,384) that looks great even without electronic stabilization turned on.\nI took this shot of a woman having her personal photo shoot in front of the Plaza Hotel. Although it's jerky and not cinematic, it was a wonderful spontaneous moment in great quality:\nWhen you turn on the electronic stabilization feature, video is reduced from 6K to \"ultra-high-def\" (3,840 x 2,160) because the camera needs to crop each frame to line up frames and make the shakiness disappear.\nIn a low-light setting, such as this video at Small's jazz club in Greenwich Village, I thought it produced a wonderful-looking film without a tripod.\nHere's where we see an example of the click-wheel at its best. I had the fun of rotating through the different color filters to change up the color from moment to moment while filming, something I would never do when color choices are a single button.\nAlthough my use of the feature is rather gimmicky here, I can see all kinds of possibilities with the click wheel, enabling new ways of controlling the camera during filming.\nLike all cameras, the sound you record with the built-in microphone video is never as good as if you had a dedicated mic attached, especially for something like music. But I thought the result here was very good in a space with challenging acoustics.\nAlso: This hidden Pixel camera setting gave my photos the pop they've been missing\nEven in low light, using the camera hand-held, you can get a nice video like this one taken in a darkened tango hall. In a dark place like a dance hall, with swaying bodies moving to and fro, with the camera in your hand and no stabilization turned on, it can be challenging to capture motion in a way that's satisfying. I love what the BF did with the color and the lights in this scene while managing to shift autofocus from one couple to the next:\nBattery life\nBattery life was fine for my purposes. I got as much as six hours of shooting on a single charge, including intermittent shooting and periods of intense activity. That meant in some cases over 500 exposures in DNG+JPEG format. That's better than the official specification by Sigma for approximately 260 images on a charge. Of course, your results may vary.\nIn my experience, plugging the BF into an iPad via USB-C for forty minutes will charge the camera from zero back to a third of its battery life. You can also bring along a spare battery and swap it in via the latched compartment on the bottom of the BF.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe complaints I've seen about the Sigma BF from seasoned photographers seem to be mostly about the reduction of controls to the click wheel and the mini-LCD. Consolidating controls in that way, they argue, robs the pro photographer of their muscle memory. Some pros also wish the touch screen did more to control the functions rather than just serving as a very good display.\nAlso: I tried Google's new agentic IDE, and it blows away the popular VS Code - here's how\nIn essence, pros have a hard time adjusting to a radically simplified UI. It's a fair point of view, but this is something of a Steve Jobs moment. You have to break a few eggs to make an omelette, and you may have to break habits to reinvent how photography is done.\nI think the BF is a terrific option for a beginning photographer or even an experienced pro. The touch-screen display is intuitive in a smartphone age, the electronics are just as fast as you'd expect based on smartphone picture-taking, and the output is very Instagram-worthy.\nAnd your envious friends will immediately want to know, What is that wild-looking camera you've got?"

I'm pretty familiar with the Stealth line, having reviewed several models in the past. This version doesn't reinvent the wheel. In fact, it shares many similarities with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, to its benefit and to a fault.\nAlso: The best laptops for graphic designers: Expert tested\nFirst off: on the surface, I genuinely can't tell the difference between this model and the previous generation. The Stealth 16 measures 14\"x 10.22\"x 0.85\" inches -- the exact same dimensions as the A16. It even weighs the same at 4.63 pounds.\nWhat's funny is I used to think that was really heavy, but after carrying around chunky laptops, MSI's device feels lightweight. Even with the power adapter, I didn't mind carrying it around town. By the way, I factor that adapter into the overall weight because you will need it on hand. More on that later.\nBringing back the classics\nA few other great design elements make their triumphant return. Going down the list, you have a full-size gaming keyboard. Each button has a 1.5mm travel distance, ensuring a comfortable typing feel. Six surround sound speakers are located at either end below the keyboard for immersive audio.\nOne of my favorite moments testing this laptop came from listening to \"Doomsday\" by MF Doom. The lyrical flow from Doom sounded crystal clear and powerful through the laptop's speakers, filling my entire room with his supervillainy.\nAbove the keyboard is the 16-inch OLED display. At QuadHD+ (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) resolution, it's not quite 4K, but it's close enough -- the screen still delivers impressive visual output. Colors are vibrant, the high resolution delivers detailed images, and the 240Hz refresh rate ensures smooth on-screen motion.\nPower boost\nOne of my favorite things about MSI laptops is how easy it is to tweak their performance. On many Windows 11 laptops, all you can really do is change the Power mode in the Settings, but MSI Center, its internal settings program is actually pretty robust. Here, you can adjust the computer's output on the fly. For example, enabling Extreme Performance and Discrete Graphics Mode delivers the best hardware results.\nAlso: I tested Dell's XPS successor, and it beat my $3,000 Windows laptop in almost every way\nInside my review unit was an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, and 32GB of RAM. It's a pretty good configuration, if I say so myself, and it shows in the performance numbers.\nBelow is a list comparing MSI's Stealth 16 with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI Plus, and the Dell Premium 16. You'll notice that the newer model has better raw processing and rendering power than the others, indicating it excels at handling heavy workloads and rendering complex 3D graphics.\nThere is a bit of a gap between the Stealth 16 and the A16 on PCMark 10, suggesting that the older model has better general performance; it's able to hop between web pages and apps without much issue. However, I didn't experience any slowdown. This laptop ran great everywhere.\nPCMark 10 | Geekbench 6 | Cinebench 2024 | Cinebench R23 | |\nMSI Stealth 16 AI | 7,693 | 15,883 | 1,129 | 21,656 |\nMSI Stealth A16 AI+ | 7,913 | 14,196 | N/A | 18,336 |\nDell Premium 16 | 6,865 | 14,763 | 726 | 17,522 |\nHaving Dell's machine may seem random, but you need to understand that the Stealth 16 isn't just a solid gaming computer. It's also a powerful graphic design laptop, too. For testing, I installed Blender, a free 3D creation app, and edited images on Pixlr. I'm not much of an artist, but I did manage to create and render simple scenes starring Blender's complex monkey model.\nI had a similar experience with Pixlr, as I was able to edit 4K photographs without any major hiccups. The entire process went smoothly. MSI's laptop is a powerhouse in almost every sense of the word.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for a week, and it makes even the XPS feel outdated\nAs powerful as the laptop may be, it has its limits. I ran multiple 4K YouTube livestreams as part of my usual 50-tab Chrome browser test. Everything ran fine when there were only three livestreams, although once I hit six, I noticed a slowdown. Livestreams were slow to load. It took a few seconds before the Stealth 16 could play the video as normal.\nStaying cool\nHeavy workloads do cause the Stealth 16 to heat up a bit, but high temperatures were never an issue. Heat vents are strategically placed above the keyboard, on the side of the laptop, and on the bottom, so your hands are never at risk of touching a hot keyboard. In fact, the keys stayed nice and cool the entire time. Unfortunately, this means you can't place the computer on your lap; otherwise, your legs will be blasted by hot air.\nThis ability to stay cool under duress is thanks to the Cooler Boost 5 cooling system, which consists of two large fans and five heat pipes directing hot air out through the vents. This system is also on the vastly more powerful MSI Raider 18 HX.\nUnsurprisingly, MSI's Stealth 16 is not designed to be away from its charger for long. You can push its endurance by enabling ECO-Silent and Integrated Graphics Mode in the MSI Center app, and Best Power Efficiency in Windows, but even then, it will last around six hours on a single charge, depending on what you're doing.\nLike many gaming laptops with this kind of hardware, it may have power, but it lacks in stamina. For that reason, I'd suggest this for users who don't need an all-day battery kind of laptop, but are fine with a few hour stints throughout the day.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe MSI Stealth 16 AI is on sale at Best Buy for $2,030, which is a good price for a laptop with this kind of hardware. I recommend this device to anyone looking for an affordable gaming laptop that can also be used as a work machine. If you like this laptop but want to save some cash, its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, is very similar and still relevant in 2025, retailing for $1,800.\nIf you want a more powerful graphic design computer, I suggest the Alienware 18 Area-51. It is a much more powerful gaming laptop that leaves every laptop I mentioned so far in the dust. I think it's one of the best for the year. It is, however, very expensive; my review unit cost $3,200."

These giant machines have given way to the mini PC -- a computer no bigger than a hardback book, but capable of handling demanding workloads.\nThe mini PC market can be somewhat bewildering, so I've done a considerable amount of legwork to distill things down to a handful of choices, from the Intel NUC 13 workhorse to the AceMagician AMD Ryzen 9 Mini gaming PC, to the oftentimes overlooked Apple Mac Mini.\nAlso: The best power banks: Expert tested\nWhat is the best mini PC right now?\nI've tested and researched the current mini PC offerings on the market, examining specs and paying close attention to user reviews, and my top pick for the best mini PC is the Intel NUC 13 Pro Arena Canyon, and it comes in at under $900. Whether you want a mini PC for the home, office, or meeting room, this is a solid choice and a dependable workhorse.\nThere's also never been a better time to buy, because at the time of update, prices have come down dramatically pretty much across the board.\nThe best mini PCs of 2025\nWhy we like it: When it comes to mini PCs, it's hard to beat a machine built to the Intel NUC specs. I've owned and tested a number of them myself and have been very happy with all of them.\nWith this model, we have a system running a 16-core Core i7 chip that can power up to 3.7 GHz with a built-in Iris Xe GPU. Backing that is 32GB of RAM and 1TB M.2 SSD -- that's quite a spec for a system you can hold in the palm of your hand. As for ports, this system has a multitude of USB ports, along with Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, and Ethernet. It's a real powerhouse in a compact space.\nWho it's for: This is a no-frills workhorse. No LED lights, no fancy design, just a powerful computer in a box.\nWho should look elsewhere: As mini PCs go, this one is likely overkill for most, and that s reflected in the price. There are definitely cheaper mini PCs out there.\nIntel NUC 13 Pro Arena Canyon tech specs: 12th Generation Intel Core i7-1360P | Intel Iris Xe Graphics 96EU | 32GB DDR4 RAM | 2TB M.2 NVMe SSD | 3x USB 3.2 type A, 1x USB-A, 2x Thunderbolt 4, 2x HDMI, Ethernet, audio jack | Windows 11 Pro | Price: $859\nWhy we like it: Just when you thought this list would only include Windows systems, we've got the Mac Mini. This was one of the original mini PCs, and with the switch to Apple Silicon processors, it has a new lease of life.\nThese were once considered the gateway Mac that got people over to MacOS from Windows because they could replace their Windows PC with the Mac Mini and keep using their existing keyboard, mouse, and monitor with their new Mac. It's now a staple of the Mac lineup, and the perfect choice for those who want a compact system.\nI've owned a few different Mac Mini systems over the years, and I've been more than satisfied by them. They're reliable, well-built, and run cool and quiet.\nWho it's for: This is a great choice for those who want a system they can take out of a box, set up, and start using. I set up a lot of systems, and I'm always impressed by how quick it is to get a Mac up and running. This is also a powerful system that won't disappoint.\nWho should look elsewhere: The thing with the Mac Mini is that you're having to use the macOS, and if that's new to you because you've got years on Windows muscle memory under your belt, then this could be a big, frustrating learning curve.\nThe other downside to this system is upgrading -- bottom line, this Mac will live and die with the same processor, RAM, and storage that it left the factory with. If upgrading is your thing, give Macs a miss.\nApple 2023 Mac mini tech specs: Apple Silicon M4 processor with 10 CPU cores, 10 GPU cores | 16GB RAM | 256GB storage | 2x USB-C, 3x Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, Ethernet, audio jack | MacOS | Price: Starting at $539\nWhy we like it: This is a tiny mini PC that is a cube measuring 72 x 72 x 44.5mm, weighing only 206g. Inside the cube is a 4-core Intel N5105 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB M.2 SSD running Windows 10 Pro. I had no problem upgrading mine to Windows 11.\nDespite the tiny size, this mini PC features a handful of USB ports, two HDMI ports, an audio jack, and an Ethernet port. This system has no problems running two 4K at 60FPS (frames per second) displays for maximum productivity.\nAnd yet given the power, this system is quiet and very energy efficient -- using only 10W -- making it a great choice for someone who wants a PC for the home, office, or meeting room, or even to drive digital signage.\nWho it's for: This is for people who want not just a small PC but a tiny PC. A really tiny PC.\nWho should look elsewhere: This is a system that definitely puts size -- or the lack thereof -- ahead of power and performance. While this is great for situations where you need a compact PC, if you have more space, you might be better going for something that offers a bit more power.\nGMKtec Mini PC tech specs: 11th Generation Intel N5105 | Intel UHD Graphics | 8GB DDR4 RAM | 128GB M.2 NVMe SSD | 3x USB 3.2 type A, USB-C, 2x HDMI, Ethernet, TF/microSD slot, audio jack | Windows 10 Pro | Price: $123\nWhy we like it: It's small, and it's budget friendly. That's a neat combination. The Beelink S12 Pro offers a lot of bang for your buck in a compact design that is at home on a desk or attached to the back of a TV.\nWho it's for: This system's price makes it a perfect choice for those who want a cheap yet powerful mini PC. As long as you're not running AAA-title games or other heavy workloads, this system has you covered.\nWho should look elsewhere: The only con to this system is that it runs the older 12th-gen Intel silicon, but for $149, this is still a system that both holds its own and won't break the bank.\nBeelink S12 Mini PC tech specs: 12th Generation Intel N100 | Intel UHD Graphics | 16GB DDR4 RAM | 500GB SSD | 4x USB 3.2 type A, 2x HDMI, Ethernet, audio jack | Windows 11 | Price: $149\nWhy we like it: This mini PC describes itself as a gaming system, and with good reason. The combination of AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX and AMD Radeon 680M GPU gives this system a lot of horsepower to tackle a variety of workloads, from work to games.\nThis system features a power dial on the top to switch it between silent mode, auto, and performance, depending on whether you want power or silence. It also includes a multitude of LED lights, which you might love or hate. If you love them, great, if not, there's an app that turns them off for you.\nWho it's for: This is for people who don't want their mini PC to look like little boxes. This one throws away the design rulebook. While most mini PCs are cube-like, this one is an upright tent shape. While that might seem like purely a design choice, it does in fact make opening up the system to carry out upgrades a snap as the side panel is held in place with magnets.\nWho should look elsewhere: While I like the design of this mini PC, it's not all that conducive if your outcome is to tuck it behind a TV or under a desk. In these situations, you'd be better looking for a more traditional mini PC.\nAceMagician AMD Ryzen 9 Mini PC tech specs: AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX | AMD Radeon 680M GPU | 32GB DDR4 RAM | 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD | 3x USB 3.2 type A, 2x HDMI, Ethernet, USB-C, audio jack | Windows 11 Pro | Price: $499\nWhat are the tariffs in the U.S.?\nThe recent U.S. tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nAlso: Tariff war has tech buyers wondering what's next. Here's what we know\nLaptops and PCs are also hit hard by the new U.S. tariffs, with import duties potentially increasing prices by up to 35%. Many major brands still rely on Chinese and Vietnamese factories for assembly, meaning consumers could soon pay significantly more for everything from budget Chromebooks to high-end gaming rigs.\nThese tariffs may accelerate efforts to move production to regions like Mexico or India, but shoppers can expect higher costs and fewer discounts in the short term.\nRight now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.\nAlso: Tariff exemptions for electronics offer a break for tech - but not for long\nLatest info on mini PC in 2025\nA Minisforum mini PC with 128GB RAM is on the way\nI keep hearing whispers -- as well as seeing signs on the benchmarking sites -- of a Minisforum mini PC powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 APU.

If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nAs a Linux poweruser, I have to highlight this distro for its fresh desktop environment\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- NixOS is an open-source operating system that is available to install and use for free.\n- It offers several desktop environments to choose from, is as rock-solid as any OS on the market, and performs quite well.\n- However, there's a fairly steep learning curve for installing non-free software.\nBefore we get into this review, I want to offer some information for new Linux users. If you're uncomfortable using the command line or diving down rabbit holes to figure out how to do something that should \"just work out of the box,\" then NixOS is probably not for you.\nAlso: These 6 Linux file managers are way better than your default\nHowever, that's not to say someone with minimal familiarity with the command line would fail with this distribution. For example, if you only need open-source software, NixOS could be a viable option. If, however, you need apps like Chrome, Slack, and Spotify, you might run into some frustration that will send you packing back to Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Windows.\nWith that said, let's get to what makes this distribution great.\nNot everyone wants an Ubuntu or Linux Mint distribution. I'm not saying those two operating systems aren't outstanding, but at some point, a Linux user might want something a bit more robust.\nI've tried nearly every Linux OS I've come across, from the ridiculously simple (Ubuntu) to the astoundingly complex (Gentoo) and everything in between. So when I find a Linux distribution that can challenge me, I jump at the chance to see what it can do.\nSuch is the case with NixOS. This from-scratch Linux distribution isn't nearly as difficult as Gentoo, but it's not quite as user-friendly as Ubuntu. Where does that leave it? I'd say somewhere between Ubuntu and Arch Linux.\nAlso: 6 most Windows-like Linux distros because old habits die hard\nYou'll find two official versions of NixOS -- one with GNOME and one with Plasma Desktop. During the installation, you'll be offered the opportunity to install from a list of different desktop environments. For my testing, I chose Deepin Desktop because I'm a fan of its layout. So you might be asking: With so many easy-to-use desktop environments, why would NixOS be considered challenging for new users?\nFirst off, there's no GUI app store. That's right. With NixOS, you install packages via the command line. But don't worry, NixOS has something to help you out with that. Open your web browser and point it to search.nixos.org. On that site, you can search for any piece of software you need to install, and it will give you the command to do just that. For example, to search for Slack, the install command is:\nnix-shell -p slack\nAh, but we then run into our first problem. You see, out of the box, NixOS is configured not to install non-free software without a bit of help. When you run the above command, you'll see in the output that there are two ways around this:\n- a) To temporarily allow non-free packages, you can set a particular environment variable with the command: export NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1\n- b) For `nixos-rebuild` set { nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true; } in /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.\nHowever, when I look in configuration.nix, the allowUnfree option is already set to true. What's the deal? Turns out, even though that option is global, you still have to create a config file in your home directory, specifically in ~/.config/nixpkgs. Oh, but wait, the nixpkgs directory doesn't exist, so you have to create it first.\nAlso: You can try Linux without ditching Windows first - here's how\nHopefully, you're starting to see why, even with a user-friendly GUI, NixOS isn't a good choice for new users. It's a great choice if you have plenty of Linux experience, as it's as rock solid as Debian or Arch. And if you only want to use open-source (free) software, you won't have much in the way of problems (as long as you're comfortable with the command line).\nBeyond the installation of non-free software, what is NixOS like? It's a stable, efficient operating system that's also secure and includes nearly everything you need to get started (minus an office suite and email client). For those who need an office suite, you can install LibreOffice with:\nnix-shell -p libreoffice\nIf you need an email client, try:\nnix-shell -p thunderbird\nThe final frustration I'll mention with this is that, even after successfully installing an app, you won't find it in the menu. Argh! I even had an instance where, after installing LibreOffice and logging out, it seemed LibreOffice vanished, and I had to install it again.\nEven then, I opened the app and tried adding it to the dock, only to discover it was an unrecognized application. The good news is that after a reboot, everything was exactly as it should have been. I'm just not used to rebooting after installing an application in Linux. Go figure.\nFrustrations can mount quickly with NixOS. Those frustrations are, however, surmountable. It just takes time. And effort. And Google (or DuckDuckGo). That's why I recommend NixOS to Linux users who have a solid understanding of the basics.\nAlso: I found a better way to transfer files between Android and Linux - and it's free\nZDNET's advice\nUsually, when I do a review of a Linux distribution, I install it as a VirtualBox virtual machine, kick the tires, and delete the VM when I'm finished. However, with NixOS, I plan on keeping it around for a while so I can better learn the ins and outs of using this fascinating OS.\nIf you're comfortable using the Linux command line and like a challenge, you should certainly give NixOS a try. Once you have everything up and running with this open-source operating system, it will not let you down."

If your primary access to the internet is your phone, you are probably using a tool like Authy or Google Authenticator.\nBut what about when you're on the desktop? What do you use?\nAlso: 7 essential password rules to follow, according to security experts\nThere are options that have been around for a while (such as Bitwarden, Authy, or Authenticator), and there's even a new option available from the makers of Proton VPN. That new solution is aptly named Proton Authenticator, and it has quickly become one of my favorite desktop 2FA apps.\nYou might be thinking, \"Why not just grab your phone when you need that 2FA code?\" Reason number one is that when I'm working on my desktop, it's more efficient to open an app directly. Reason number two is that sometimes my phone might not be within reach, and I don't want to track it down for that 2FA code. Ergo... desktop app.\nThe new Proton Authenticator is available for Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, iOS, and iPadOS.\nWhat's there to say about a 2FA app? It allows you to create accounts for which you will have time-based codes to use for the added layer of security. But what makes Proton Authenticator my new go-to for 2FA?\nAlso: Protect yourself: How to choose the right two-factor authenticator app\nFor one thing, I can not only use it on my desktop, but also on my phone, and any account I've added to the app will sync between the two. That's a big deal when I'm moving from my desktop to my phone (or vice versa) and don't want to have to switch between 2FA apps.\nAnother reason is that the Proton Authenticator UI is one of the best I've used for 2FA. It's simple, elegant, and very easy to use. Even better, the UI is similar for both the desktop and mobile app, so once you know one, you'll know the other.\nSpeaking of which, the Proton Authenticator is very easy to use. Click Add to create a new entry, fill in the necessary fields (Title, Secret Key, and Issuer), click \"Save code,\" and you're done. The only difference between using the desktop and mobile app is that on the desktop app, you have to manually type the secret key (usually presented under the QR code for your account), and the mobile app allows you to scan the QR code with your phone's camera.\nAlso: What are passkeys? How going passwordless can simplify your life in 2025\nWhen creating a new entry, you'll also find the Advanced options section, which allows you to configure the number of digits for the code (usually it's 6), the time interval each code will be valid (default is 30 seconds), which algorithm to use, and the type (TOTP or STEAM - TOTP is the most widely used).\nConfiguration options\nThe Proton Authenticator has a few helpful options within Settings (click the Gear icon on the main window).\nAlso: Proton Pass vs. 1Password: Which password manager is right for you?\nWithin Settings, you can enable \"Sync between devices\" (it's disabled by default), an app lock, whether you want to hide the codes (you won't see the codes, but if you click on one it is copied to your clipboard), enable backups, theme, digit style, animate code change, import/export, and support options.\nYou can also enable biometric unlock on your mobile device, which is a plus for security.\nNo account required\nYou can use the Proton Authenticator free of charge (on both desktop and mobile). The only reason an account is necessary is if you want to sync between devices. Even if you use Proton Authenticator for free, there are no ads, nor does the app track you or share telemetry with the company.\nAlso: 7 password rules security experts live by in 2025 - the last one might surprise you\nIf you've grown tired of your current 2FA app, you can import all of your entries into Proton Authenticator. Supported 2FA apps include Google Authenticator, Aegis Authenticator, Bitwarden Authenticator, and LastPass Authenticator. Alas, Authy is not supported for this feature.\nInstallation\nInstalling Proton Authenticator is simple:\n- On Linux, download either the .deb or .rpm from the official download page and run the command to install (such as sudo dpkg -i ProtonAuthenticator*.deb).\n- On MacOS and Windows, download the installer, double-click it, and walk through the simple wizard.\n- On Android/iOS/iPadOS, locate Proton Authenticator in your phone's app store, and install it.\nOnce installed, open the app and start adding accounts.\nAlso: 4 things Proton's privacy-first AI chatbot Lumo can do - and how to try it\nI've been using the Proton Authenticator since version 1.0 was released, and I'm slowly migrating from Authy and Google Authenticator to my new favorite default.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI revisited the System76 Thelio, and it remains my all-time favorite desktop\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The System76 Thelio r3 is available now, starting at $1,399.\n- It's sleek, beautiful, powerful, and can handle anything you throw at it.\n- Some might find it pricey but the longevity, performance, and attention to detail of these System76 machines is worth every penny.\nI've been a big fan of System76 for years. They've been champions of Linux machines for a long time and every time I get a chance to work with one of their new computers, they never fail to impress me on every level that counts.\nI purchased my first system from the company (a Leopard Extreme) back in 2013. That machine served me for six years, at which point I upgraded to their latest offering, the Thelio. That was back in 2019, and it performed like a champ until just recently, when the On/Off button stopped working and one of the HDMI ports ceased to send a signal.\nAlso: System76's new COSMIC Linux desktop is out of this world\nAlthough the second machine didn't last nearly as long as the first, I had to remind myself that I purchased that first Thelio as soon as they were released, meaning it was a first iteration. Since then, the company has made serious changes to the Thelio line-up and improved each machine all around.\nWhen my original Thelio hinted that it was on its last legs, I had to act fast. I spend a lot of time working at my desk, and that machine is essential to my day-to-day. So, I started configuring my new PC and quickly decided I was going to do something I'd never done: shrug off Intel. That's right, I went the AMD route with a Ryzen 9 7900X (12 cores/24 threads). The rest of the custom specs look like this:\n- RAM - 32 GB DDR5 4800 MHz (1x32)\n- Internal storage - 500 GB PCIe4 M.2 SSD\n- GPU - 8 GB AMD Radeon RX 7600\n- Top ports - 1x USB 3.2 Gen2 (Type-C), 1x USB 3.2 Gen1 (Type A), Mic, Headphone\n- Rear Ports - 2x USB 3.2 Gen 1 (Type-A), 3x USB 3.2 Gen 2 (Type-A), 1x 2.5Gbps LAN, USB 3.2 Gen2x2 (Type-C)\n- Rear Audio - Mic, Line out, Line in\n- Networking - 2.5GbE, built-in Wifi 6E (a/b/g/n/ac/ax) with Bluetooth 5.2\n- Dimensions - 12.87\u2033 \u00d7 8.15\u2033 \u00d7 11.46\u2033 (327 \u00d7 207 \u00d7 291mm)\n- OS - Pop!_OS Linux\n- Price - As configured, just over $2k.\nMy original Thelio included an Intel i9 CPU and 32 GB of RAM, but depended on the integrated Intel graphics card. That machine was a beast and didn't blink at anything I tossed its way, from virtual machines, containers, video rendering, and just about anything I required.\nHaving to say goodbye to that r1 Thelio was tough, but I knew its time had come. When its replacement arrived, however those concerns were immediately assuaged. Upon pulling the computer out of the box, I was immediately struck by how the machine had evolved from the first iteration. Yes, there were plenty of similarities, but the differences made this an entirely new experience.\nAlso: What graphics card do I have? How to check your GPU and drivers\nFirst off, having ports on the top of the case is a welcome improvement. I often have to switch out different peripherals (such as card readers, external drives, etc.) and hated having to pull the case out, grab a flashlight, and switch 'em out. Now, I can do that with ease.\nAlso, I opted to go with the etched panel (instead of the wood insert) and I'm glad I did. This addition gives the case just enough flare to make it stand out.\nBut the flare doesn't stop there. Open the case and you'll find all sorts of artistry on display, such as the small rocketships carved out of the chassis. I've always felt that System76 never failed to go above and beyond and this new Thelio proves it.\nBut what about performance?\nSo far, I'm seriously impressed. The AMD CPU is outperforming the Intel i9. Of course, the power could be bolstered by the Radeon RX 7600, so it's hard to tell. But the overall effect is that the r3 Thelio is a big improvement over the r1\u2026and that's saying something.\nAlso: 5 reasons why Linux will overtake Windows and MacOS on the desktop - eventually\nWhen you've been working with a brilliant piece of hardware for years, swapping that out for something else can be a crapshoot. But when you're dealing with a company like System76, you know the kind of effort they put into improving their machines and they did not disappoint with their latest Thelio incarnation.\nThis machine is exactly what I wanted and needed and should serve me well for years to come. Although I've not really stressed it with any heavy workloads to speak of, I've spun up a number of virtual machines, and gone through my usual workday for about a week now and have been impressed at every turn. The System76 Thelio is all upside and doesn't suffer from a single issue.\nZDNET's buying advice\nOf all the computers I've ever used, the System76 Thelio is, far and away, the best. Hands down. End of story. If you need an upgrade to the hardware you're currently using, you cannot go wrong with one of these beasts.\nIf you're looking to replace your current desktop computer, you'd be hard-pressed to find a machine that is equal parts power and beauty like the Thelio. Trust me when I tell you that you won't regret the purchase."

      "text": "I was an AI skeptic until these 5 tools changed my mind\nIt's taken me a while to come around, but I've become a fan of certain AI tools -- when used for specific purposes. I've even found some of those tools to be very helpful throughout my day (so much so that I haven't used Google's search engine in weeks).\nThat, my friends, is refreshing.\nHow I got here was a bit circuitous. I started out 100% against AI but then I realized I was against AI when used as a shortcut for things like writing and other artistic endeavors. Once I realized AI was very good at helping me research different areas (where I'd previously used a search engine), I adopted it into my process.\nAlso: How I made Perplexity AI the default search engine in my browser\nWhen I'm working on something, if I need to understand a concept (such as the weight of NASA's Crawler), I'll use AI. Inevitably, when I get my answer, there are other rabbit holes to follow, which leads to me learning something.\nI love to learn.\nBut what tools am I using, and how do they get worked into my processes? Why don't I just tell you?\n1. Ollama/Msty\nThis is the combination I use the most. Ollama is a command-line AI tool that allows me to use specific LLMs locally, so I can trust my queries don't wind up on a third-party server, waiting to be used for whatever purpose. The LLM I use the most with that combination is Llama 3.2 because it's fast and to the point. The answers I get from Llama 3.2 trim all the fat, so I get only the answers I need.\nAlso: How I feed my files to a local AI for better, more relevant responses\nMsty is a front-end for Ollama, which means I can use a handy GUI instead of the command line. Although the command line is second nature to me, when I'm working on my local desktop, I'd prefer a GUI. The good news is that Msty is available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows, so it doesn't matter what OS I'm using -- Ollama/Msty is there to help me with my research.\n2. DeepSeek R1/Msty\nRemember when I said that Llama 3.2 got right to the point with its answers? Every so often, I need more from my research assistant; I need it to dig deeper and present even more rabbit holes for me to dive into. I might be writing a book about time travel and need to get a foundational understanding of how it could work. With the right information, that could lead me down other avenues where I could come up with something even better for a plot. That's when I turn to DeepSeek R1. When I need something quick and easy, if I were to use DeepSeek R1, I'd wind up frustrated.\nAlso: How to run DeepSeek AI locally to protect your privacy - 2 easy ways\nWhy? DeepSeek R1 is really long-winded. It's like your friend telling you a story but adding so much detail that it takes forever to get to the point. When I need lots of detail, I switch LLMs in Msty from Llama 3.2 to DeepSeek R1. I might have to spend considerably more time waiting for the response and combing through it, but when detailed information is required, it's worth every second.\n3. Perplexity\nPerplexity has become my default search engine in Zen Browser. Why did I do this? First off, I dislike and distrust Google's search engine. There's no way of knowing if my data is being used against me for building a profile, and Google's algorithm never seems to get it right for me. Besides, when I use a search engine for research purposes, I inevitably wind up on a site that is either so overrun by ads that it brings my browser to a crawl, has incorrect or out-of-date information, or it's painfully obvious that Google would rather serve me sites that pay the company rather than give me the answers I need.\nAlso: What is Perplexity Deep Research, and how do you use it?\nPerplexity makes for a much better replacement because I get the answers I need -- without the filler, ads, or poorly coded pages.\n4. Aria\nAlthough I switched to Zen Browser as my default, I still use Opera for certain purposes. For instance, when I'm working on something and I know I'll need to keep going back to AI for research, I might open that work in Opera and use Aria as needed. The reason for this is that Aria is easily accessible from the Opera sidebar. I can click the Aria icon, and a panel opens, where I can run my query. When I'm done, the panel slides out of the way, and I'm back to work. The Opera/Aria integration is the best AI/browser combo on the market.\n5. Gemini\nAlthough I've installed Perplexity on my Android phone, it cannot be used as the default digital assistant -- that's Gemini's job.\nAlso: The best AI chatbots of 2025: ChatGPT, Copilot, and notable alternatives\nWhen I'm on the go, if I need to do some quick research, I'll ask Gemini my query or use it to set alarms, add appointments to my calendar, send messages, etc. If you're an Android user, it's hard to avoid using Gemini. I have also used Gemini Live, as it makes for a great way to work through problems. Usually, I'll turn to my wife or my best friend, but when I need absolutely unbiased information, Gemini Live is a great place to start."

      "text": "My two favorite AI apps on Linux - and how I use them to get more done\nWhen AI first hit the scene in its current form, I was dead set against it because of the generative nature of what was being sold to the public. I considered any shortcut to creating art to be offensive to the craft.\nBut then I realized I could use AI for something that traditional searching was starting to fail at: Research.\nAlso: Claude AI can do your research and handle your emails now - here's how\nWith both sides of my writing career (fiction and nonfiction), I have to do quite a bit of research, and Google was becoming a hindrance to that process. Instead of being fed helpful information, I was inundated with ads, sponsored content, and its own AI-based answers (which were rarely helpful).\nI first kicked the tires with Opera's Aria, which showed me that AI could actually be helpful. At the same time, I realized that AI also had to be supervised because it could be wrong as easily as it could be right.\nI also found another helpful thing about AI in that it could lead me down some fun rabbit holes, where I might discover something really cool to investigate. Ultimately, that journey led me to two AI tools, both of which could be installed and used on Linux for free.\nThose two tools have helped me get more done on a daily basis.\n1. Ollama/Msty\nOllama is an open-source AI tool. Its open-source nature is one of the primary reasons I was drawn to it because I know developers around the world can vet its code, and to date, no one has come out to say they've discovered anything untoward in the code.\nOn top of the open-source nature of Ollama, it's just easy to install and use. And the fact that you can download and use several different LLMs is a bit of delicious icing on an already sweet cake. I can use Cogito, Gemma 3, DeepSeek R1, Llama 3.3, Llama 3.2, Phi 4, QwQ, and many more.\nAlso: How I feed my files to a local AI for better, more relevant responses\nBut the main reason I prefer Ollama over any other AI tool is that it can be used locally, which means my queries aren't accessible by a third party. I like that level of privacy.\nBut how does Ollama help me get things done? First, there's the prompts library, which gives you access to several quick prompts and even allows you to create custom prompts. One prompt I often type is \"Do a deep dive into the following topic and make sure to explore any relevant side topics:\". Instead of always having to type that prompt, I can create a quick prompt for it, so all I have to type is the subject matter. On top of that, I don't have to remember to prompt Ollama to explore relevant topics.\nAlso: How to run DeepSeek AI locally to protect your privacy - 2 easy ways\nI create that quick prompt within the library so I can easily call upon it whenever I need. This saves me time and ensures I always get the prompt right every time. I don't have to think about what the prompt needs to say, and I can make the prompt as easy or complicated as I need.\nThe Prompts Library is very helpful, especially when I have more complex prompts that I regularly type.\nAlso: I tried Sanctum's local AI app, and it's exactly what I needed to keep my data private\nNext, there are the knowledge stacks, which allow me to add documents of my own (which always remain local) so the LLM I've chosen can use that information as a source. Let's say I've written several articles on a single subject and want to use their combined information to answer some questions. I could go back through and read everything in that series, or I could add them to a knowledge stack and then ask my question(s). Ollama will search through every document added to the stack and use that information for its response.\nIt's really helpful.\n2. Perplexity\nThere's also a desktop app available for Perplexity. The desktop app is pretty much the same as using Perplexity.ai via your browser, but I do find it a bit more efficient to use.\nThere are two main features that help me with my daily tasks: Search and Research.\nAlso: How I made Perplexity AI the default search engine in my browser (and why you should too)\nIf I want to do a standard search with Perplexity, I click the Search button, type my query, and hit Enter on my keyboard. If, on the other hand, I need a deeper dive into a subject, I hit Research and type my query.\nOne thing you have to know about the Research option is that it truly does a deep dive and can take up to 30 minutes to deliver your results. But when you need to really get into a subject, that feature is a must. The cool thing about the Research is you can click Tasks, and while it does its thing, it displays the sources used for the deep dive.\nOne thing to keep in mind with Research is that the free version limits you to the number of queries you can run per day. You can upgrade to the Professional plan for unlimited free searches and 300+ Pro searches per day. The Professional plan is $20 per month.\nAnother very handy feature in Perplexity is Spaces. With this feature, I can create custom spaces for different topics. I can then switch spaces, run a query, and know that the query will be isolated to that space, meaning when I want to recall that query, I only have to switch to the space and find it. That makes it much easier to keep track of previous queries without having to scour through a long list.\nAlso: I tried Perplexity's assistant, and only one thing stops it from being my default phone AI\nBetween those two AI tools on my Linux desktop, I am able to get much more done on a daily basis. I would highly recommend you give one (or both) of these a try.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "This official Ubuntu Spin might just be the perfect intro to Linux\nThere are so many Linux distributions that claim to be the best for those looking to try out the open source operating system. Many of them, such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Deepin Linux, and Elementary OS, are very well designed for that very purpose. They all offer unique takes on Linux and each has some special to offer.\nBut there's a lesser-known, official Ubuntu spin that really hits all the marks for new users. That distribution is Ubuntu Budgie. Not only is this take on the Linux desktop very user-friendly, but it's also quite beautiful as well.\nAlso: The best Linux laptops right now\nOne of the things I really appreciate about Ubuntu Budgie is how it seems to take nods from so many other desktop interfaces and rolls them into one. It's part Pantheon, GNOME, KDE, and Cinnamon coming together to make something completely unique and easy to use.\nAt the heart of Ubuntu Budgie is the Budgie desktop, which started as the official desktop of the EvolveOS, created by Ikey Doherty. Doherty eventually renamed his OS to Solus, with the intention of using GNOME components to create a more traditional UI.\nEventually, Doherty left the project but Budgie continued on. Now, Budgie has become the centerpiece of the official Ubuntu Spin and, according to the official website, is \"friendly to newcomers from other Operating Systems, programmers and normal users alike.\"\nAlso: Thinking about switching to Linux? 6 things you need to know\nThe development team is certainly backing up that statement. I'm always on the lookout for Linux distributions that are ideal for new users and with the release of Ubuntu Budgie 23.04, I can wholeheartedly say that this distribution might be the perfect introduction to Linux. It has the simple underpinnings of Ubuntu (including Snap packages), and a UI that makes working with Linux as easy as using Windows or MacOS.\nAlso: How to replace Windows with Linux Mint on your PC\nFrom the second you log in, and are greeted by the Budgie Welcome app, you feel right at home. And whether you've spent most of your years using MacOS or Windows, you'll immediately feel at ease.\nThe beautiful UI\nThe default Ubuntu Budgie desktop includes a desktop menu at the top left corner, a system tray and notification section at the top right, and a dock at the bottom edge of the display.\nAlso: XeroLinux could be the most beautiful Linux desktop on the market\nYou'll also find a fancy calendar/media control sidebar that slides out from the right edge of the desktop. Click the left-pointing arrow at the top right corner to reveal the sidebar, where you can see your calendar, control media playback, and check your notifications.\nClick the desktop menu button at the top left corner to reveal all of the apps installed.\nThis reminds me very much of the Elementary OS menu with an extra trick up its sleeve. If you prefer a more traditional categorized menu, click the right icon in the upper left corner of the open menu and the layout will shift to make it easier for those who prefer all of their apps brought together in related categories.\nPre-installed Software\nFor those who like to know what they are getting into before they try something new, here's a quick list of the applications that ship with Ubuntu Budgie:\n- Firefox web browser\n- Goodvibes internet radio player\n- gPodder Podcast Client\n- LibreOffice\n- Lollypop audio player\n- Thunderbird email client\nIf there's an app missing, you can simply open the Software app and install anything you need (including Snap apps, such as Spotify and Slack).\nTiling capabilities\nAlthough I'm not a big fan of strict tiling window managers, I do regularly use window snapping. For those that aren't familiar with window snapping, it's the ability to \"snap\" a window to a specific portion of the desktop. Typically, desktop operating systems allow you to easily snap a window to the left or right half of the desktop, snap it to full screen, or the top or bottom half of the display. This makes it very handy to work with windows side-by-side without having to manually adjust their position and size.\nAlso: How to get true window snapping in MacOS\nWith Ubuntu Budgie, you can snap windows to take up either horizontal or vertical halves or you can snap one window to each corner to take up a quarter of the screen. With a large enough display, this feature can help take your multitasking to new heights. Of course, with a smaller display (such as when using Ubuntu Budgie in a virtual machine), that can get a bit cramped.\nMy only dislike is the dark theme\u2026but that's a very personal thing. I've never been a fan of dark themes, so it's generally the first thing I change on my desktop. Ubuntu Budgie makes that easy with the Budgie Welcome app. Click Makeovers & Layouts, scroll through the Appearance tab until you find a design you like, and click either Apply Makeover or Install. There aren't a lot of Makeovers & Layouts to choose from, but you'll probably find one you like.\nShould you try Ubuntu Budgie?\nIf you're looking for a new desktop operating system that is as simple as it is beautiful, one that won't get in your way, challenge your skillset, or limit you, Ubuntu Budgie is a great option. In fact, I've become so smitten during my testing period, I'm considering making the switch myself (from Pop!_OS).\nAlso: The best Linux distros for beginners\nDownload an ISO of Ubuntu Budgie, create a bootable USB drive, and install the OS on a spare machine to see if you have the same reaction to this open source operating system."
