Proactive Px\u2122 will enable health systems to move beyond reactive contact center calls, engaging patients proactively through outbound voice and SMS AI agents that deliver quick and convenient access to care. Health systems will be able to launch intelligent outbound campaigns featuring appointment and referral reminders, billing support and Rx management, that drive better operational efficiency, improved patient outcomes and maximized revenue.\n\nAs part of the Proactive Px\u2122 launch, Hyro is offering a complimentary AI agent, ARMR\u2122 (ACA Re-Enrollment & Medicaid Redetermination), to health systems across the U.S. to proactively address upcoming operational challenges caused by OBBBA. Starting in November 2025, OBBBA is expected to trigger some of the most significant coverage disruptions in over a decade, with up to 10 million Americans projected to lose health insurance, including 7.5 million Medicaid enrollees, 2 million ACA marketplace members, and millions more who will face higher premiums and more frequent eligibility checks, making it harder to stay insured.\n\nThe projected impact to the financial security of health systems as a direct result of OBBBA are significant: $204 billion in uncompensated care over the next decade, including $63 billion in direct hospital impact, with rural providers expected to be hit especially hard. Without proactive action, the result will be treatment interruptions, delayed care, worsening chronic conditions, and severe financial strain.\n\nHyro's ARMR\u2122 Outreach, already being implemented for their current client roster, is built to help healthcare organizations get ahead now, with the aim of keeping more patients informed and insured, and protecting care continuity. Health systems will be able to create and automate workflows around awareness for incoming changes surrounding the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, messaging and calling patients who are at risk of being affected by coverage changes or who need to re-enroll. For ARMR\u2122 Outreach, the infrastructure and onboarding are provided at no cost, with third party API calls covered by clients to ensure that the solution remains sustainable and available to as many health systems and patients as possible.",
