  "description": "\"Balance of Power: Late Edition\" focuses on the intersection of politics and global business. On today's show, Peter Navarro, White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, reacts to the latest CPI report. Michael Froman, Council on Foreign Relations President, talks about the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs, and Democratic Mayor Arunan Arulampalam of Hartford, Connecticut & Republican Mayor Jerry Dyer of Fresno, California, share their thoughts on President Trump deploying the National Guard on Washington, D.C.  (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "> > THIS IS BALANCE OF POWER, LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. JOE: FROM BLOOMBERG'S WASHINGTON, D.C. STUDIOS TO OUR TV AND RADIO AUDIENCES WORLDWIDE, WELCOME TO BALANCE OF POWER, I'M JOE MATHIEU. CALM ON WALL STREET AMID THE TRADE TURBULENCE TONIGHT. THE S & P 500 TOPPING A FRESH RECORD TODAY ON THE NEW CPI DATA SHOWING INFLATION ACCELERATING IN JULY, THE STRONGEST PACE SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR. THE IN-LINE READING BOLSTERED SPECULATION OF A FED RATE CUT IN SEPTEMBER. PLUS WITH NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS ARRIVING IN WASHINGTON FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT'S BORDER, WE WILL DISCUSS HOW OTHER CITIES ARE BRACING FOR POTENTIAL FALLOUT. THE WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA DESPITE AN EXTENSION OF THEIR 90 DAY TRUCE. WHY BEIJING IS URGING FIRMS TO AVOID NVIDIA'S H20 CHIPS AFTER THE PRESIDENT ALLOWED THEIR SALE. WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE LATEST FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER THE S & P 500 HIT A RECORD HIGH FOLLOWING THE LATEST SEAT EI DATA FROM JULY PUSHING INVESTORS TO BET ON A FED RATE HIKE NEXT MONTH. TODAY'S RALLY COMING AS WE LEARN THE DETAILS OF THE PRESIDENTS PICK TO LEAD THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. THE NOMINEE SAID THE JOBS REPORT SHOULD BE SUSPENDED. > > IF THE JOBS DATA IS NOT RELIABLE? > > THE JOBS DATA HAS HAD MASSIVE REVISIONS. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ALL THE DATA, ANY DATA POINT COMING OUT OF THE BLS IS TRUSTWORTHY AND ACCURATE WHICH IS WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS RESTORED NEW LEADERSHIP AT THE BLS. JOE: JOINING US FOR MORE ON THAT AND A POTENTIAL LAWSUIT AGAINST FED CHAIR JAY POWELL FROM THE PRESIDENT, WHEN THE IS WITH US. YOU CAN SPIN NUMBERS ANYWAY YOU WANT AND YOU COULD SPIN IT TOWARD FED ACTION OR STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMY OR THE DEMOCRAT, CRITICIZING THE WHITE HOUSE YOU MIGHT SEE THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS IS FINALLY STARTING TO SHOW. > > THE ADMINISTRATION IS FRAMING THIS AS FRANKLY ANY ADMINISTRATION WOULD, AS A WIN, THE INFLATION IS IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS, BUT THE EXPECTATIONS WERE FOR AN INCREASE AND THEY GOT ONE. IT IS NOT AS BAD AS A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE FEARING YET. ECONOMISTS ARE STILL BELIEVING THE WORST IS YET TO COME OR WORSE IS YET TO COME ON THIS DATA. YES, THE ADMINISTRATION OF COURSE FRAMED IT IN A POSITIVE WAY AND TO BE FAIR JUST AS JOE BIDEN DID WHEN THE ECONOMY WASN'T DOING SO WELL AND HE WOULD SAY, LOOK AT THESE GREAT NUMBERS, THAT IS JUST WHAT PRESIDENTS DO. MORE ALARMING IS WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO OF ANTONI, THE NEXT BLS CHIEF SAYING WE WILL JUST, WE WON'T PUT OUT MONTHLY JOBS DATA. JOE: HE HAS SAID THAT MONTHS AGO. DOES HE STILL BELIEVE THAT TODAY. THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT WILL NOT SUSPEND JOBS REPORTS. WENDY: IT ALSO SAID THEY WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON. KAROLINE LEAVITT LEFT ROOM. WE THINK HE FEELS THAT WAY. THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SET OF ECONOMIC DATA RELEASED EVERY MONTH. BUSINESSES USE IT, MARKETS YOU SAID, GOVERNMENTS USE IT. IT IS CRUCIAL THOSE COME OUT. THE REVISIONS ARE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE. IT IS A LEADING INDICATOR. WHEN THE DATA CATCHES UP, THEY REVISE. SOMETIMES IT IS A SMALL REVISION, SOMETIMES IT IS A LITTLE REVISION AND THAT IS THE WAY IT WORK. JOE: WENDY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE TURN TO HOW ANALYSTS REACTED TODAY ON BLOOMBERG. > > WE SEE THAT INFLATION CREEPING INTO SERVICES AND THAT IS AN ISSUE FOR THE CONSUMER IN TERMS OF IS THE CONSUMER STARTING TO MAKE TOUGHER CHOICES BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS? > > IT APPEARS COMPANIES HAVE ROOM BECAUSE OF STILL HIGH MARGINS COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC, THEY HAVE ROOM TO MORE SLOWLY PASS THIS ON TO CONSUMERS. > > PEOPLE SAY RETAILERS ARE GOING TO EAT IT, NO, THEY JUST WROTE A CHECK. EVENTUALLY THEY ARE GOING TO PASS IT ON. > > IT IS EITHER GOING TO BE THE CONSUMER OR THE STOCK MARKET AND THE CONSUMER EVENTUALLY FEEDS THROUGH TO THE STOCK MARKET. JOE: WE TURN TO POWER MOVES WITH ROMAINE BOSTICK JOINING US LIVE FROM WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. ROMAINE: IT WAS QUITE A MOVE HIGHER. YOU MENTIONED IT EARLIER. THAT WAS LARGELY BASED ON AN INFLATION REPORT THAT WAS NOT NECESSARILY GOOD BUT FOR A LOT OF INVESTORS IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH, THE IDEA IT WILL INVITE ENOUGH WIGGLE ROOM FOR THE FED TO CUT RATES AS SOON AS MID-SEPTEMBER AND THAT WAS A BIG PART OF THE REASON THE RALLY, BUT AS YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THOSE VOICES, THERE IS SOME CONCERN WE ARE MAYBE NOT GETTING A FULL PICTURE OR MAY BE THE PICTURE AS IT MIGHT BE SEVERAL MONTHS FROM NOW. THE IDEA THAT TARIFFS ARE IN EFFECT. WE GOT DATA SHOWING $28 BILLION IN TARIFF REVENUE COLLECTED IN THE PAST MONTH IN JULY. THE BIG QUESTION IS WHO IS PAYING THAT? MAYBE A LOT OF CORPORATIONS ARE EATING THAT COST RIGHT NOW AND IF THEY CONTINUE TO EAT THAT COST, THAT WILL SHOW UP IN THE BOTTOM LINES OF THE COMPANIES. IF THEY DON'T EAT THE COST, IT WILL GET PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER AND MAYBE WE WILL SEE A DOWNDRAFT IN CONSUMER SPENDING BUT INVESTORS SEEM TO CHEER WHAT THEY HEARD EARLIER TODAY AND EVEN THE PRESIDENT USED IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO. TAKE A LOOK. WE IMPLEMENTED THESE TARIFFS AND TRADE POLICIES AND AS OF JULY 2025 WE HAVE NOT NECESSARILY SEEN A HUGE NEGATIVE AND ACT ON THEM. JOE: ROMAINE, THANK YOU. ROMAINE BOSTICK JOINING US FROM NEW YORK. NOW WE ARE JOINED BY PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR COUNSELOR FOR TRADE AND MANUFACTURING. SOME MIGHT SUGGEST YOU ARE THE ARCHITECT OF THIS IDEA. I WANT TO START WITH YOU ON CPI. BIG DAY FOR DATA. ARE YOU BUYING THESE NUMBERS BECAUSE THESE ARE FROM BLS? PETER: YES, I'M BUYING THE NUMBERS. I WANT TO AMPLIFY WHAT ROMAINE SAID. THIS WASN'T A BAD REPORT OR AN OK REPORT, THIS WAS A VERY GOOD REPORT. THE CPI CAME IN AT 2.7%, WHICH SEEMS SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE TARGET, BUT IN FACT THE FEDERAL RESERVE USES ANOTHER GAUGE CALLED THE PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES INDEX AND THAT ONE RUNS 0.2% TO 0.4% LOWER. THAT GETS CLOSER TO TARGET. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANNUALIZED BASED ON A SIX-MONTH BASIS SINCE TRUMP TOOK OFFICE IT IS 1.9%. 1.9%. THEN WHEN YOU DIVE INTO THE INDIVIDUAL NUMBERS, YOU HAVE ENERGY PRICES DOWN, THAT'S A VERY BIG DEAL. YOU HAD FOOD PRICES FLAPPED, THAT IS GOOD. SHELTER COSTS WERE UP, BUT THAT IS A MIRAGE BECAUSE THE WAY SHELTER COSTS ARE CALCULATED, IT IS VERY MUCH A LAGGING INDICATOR AND IF YOU LOOK AT PRIVATE RENTAL SURVEYS YOU CAN SEE THAT THOSE COSTS ARE COMING DOWN. IN PART BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING DOWN BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING WITH THE SURGE WE HAD IN RENT FROM THE BIDEN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. SO ALL OF THIS IS POINTING TO A REALLY BEAUTIFUL SITUATION WITH INFLATION AND THE MESSAGE TO TOO LATE JAY POWELL IS COME ON. THE OTHER THING IS THE THINGS THAT WENT UP, IF YOU LOOK AT THE THINGS THAT HAD A LITTLE BIT OF BUMP IN THEM, AIRLINES, USED CARS, NONE OF THAT IS TARIFFS RELATED. JOE: IT WASN'T GOODS PRICES IN MANY CASES WHICH I GUESS YOU FEEL HIS VINDICATION IN THIS CASE. YOU KNOW STU LEONARD'S GROCERY CHAIN IN THE NORTHEAST? STU IS HAVING TROUBLE HE SAID, PRICES HAVE STARTED TO GO UP A LITTLE BIT AND HE IS WONDERING WHERE THE LINE IS AND WHETHER HE HAS TO PASS SOME OF THIS ON TO HIS CUSTOMERS. TO GO TO GROUND TO A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. LISTEN TO STEW LEONARD FROM EARLIER TONIGHT. > > WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS NAVIGATE. WE ARE EATING A LITTLE BIT ON THE MARGIN AND WE ARE ALREADY ON THIN MARGINS IN THE SUPERMARKET BUSINESS. I CAN'T EAT IT FOREVER. WE ARE HANGING BY OUR FINGERNAILS RIGHT NOW, WE CAN'T DO THIS FOREVER AND I'M HOPING ALL OF TRUMP'S TARIFF DEALS AND EVERYTHING THINGS WILL WORK THEMSELVES OUT AND I'M HOPING WE WILL GO INTO THE HOLIDAYS LIKE TRUMP SAID WITH LOW PRICES. JOE: THAT WAS FROM LAST WEEK. HE HAS NO PROBLEM WITH TRUMP OR A PROBLEM WITH TARIFFS, BUT HE IS DEALING WITH HIS REALITY. WHAT WOULD YOU TELL HIM TO SAY TO HIS -- SAY TO HIM ABOUT THE NEXT SIX MONTHS? PETER: HE WILL BE SELLING A LOT OF FOOD. THEY ARE SAYING THE CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO EAT IT OR THE PRODUCERS ARE GOING TO EAT IT. THE THIRD POSSIBILITY IS THE ONE WHICH HISTORICALLY SHOWS IS THE CASE. THE REASON WHY WE ARE NOT SEEING INFLATION BECAUSE OF THE TARIFFS IS BECAUSE IT IS THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT ARE EATING THE TARIFFS. WHY DID THEY DO THAT? THE BIG ONES TO RUN THE BIG TRADE DEFICITS, WE ARE THE BIGGEST MARKET. IF THEY CAN'T SELL TO US, THEY ARE IN TROUBLE. JOE: DO THEY PAY IT BY GIVING IT BY GIVING INTO THEIR COMPANIES? PETER: THE COMPANIES EARN LESS PROFITS. WE WIN, THEY LOSE. JOE: THAT GOT THE PRESIDENT PRETTY UPSET TODAY. GOLDMAN FOUND THAT CONSUMERS IN THE U.S. HAVE ABSORBED ABOUT 22% OF TARIFF COSTS, BUSINESSES, 64%. YOU ARE SAYING THAT IS NOT TRUE. PETER: THE ONLY ENTITY WHICH HAS LESS RESPECT IN TERMS OF THEIR DATA THAN THE BLS THESE DAYS IS GOLDMAN SACHS. THINK ABOUT IT, JOE. THE ADVANTAGE I HAVE IS I WAS HERE IN THE FIRST TERM WERE DONALD TRUMP. EVERYBODY WAS SAYING THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS WILD, OUT-OF-CONTROL INFLATION. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SAID THERE WOULD BE A NAVARRO RECESSION WITH TARIFFS. THIS NEVER HAPPENED AND GOLDMAN SACHS WAS ONE OF THE BIG VOICES THAT WAS ALWAYS DOING THE PANICKING ABOUT INFLATION KIND OF THING. I JUST DON'T TRUST THEIR NUMBERS AND THE REASON WHY THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DON'T TRUST THEIR NUMBERS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE USUALLY WRONG. THE FIRST GUY WHO WAS THE DIRECTOR WAS GARY COHN. HE WAS THE GOLDMAN SACHS GUY. I HAD TO FIGHT GARY COHN EVERY DAY WHEN HE WAS THERE BECAUSE HE KEPT SAYING, MR. PRESIDENT, THESE TARIFFS ARE GOING TO COST CONSUMERS AND SLOW EVERYTHING DOWN. COHN LEFT WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS WRONG. TRUST YOUR EYES. TRUST YOUR EYES. WE ARE NOT SEEING ANYTHING LIKE THAT. JOE: THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT TRUST YOU RAISED WITH THE BLS OVER THE JOBS REPORT. THAT GOT WALL STREET QUESTIONING A LOT OF DATA COMING OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT. SOME FOLKS AFTER THE E.J. ANTONI APPOINTMENT ARE SAYING, WE'VE GOT A TRUMP LOYALIST NOW, MAYBE IT IS TIME TO START LOOKING AT PRIVATE RESEARCH, MAYBE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE IN THE DATA BUSINESS. PETER: I DO THINK ADDING MORE PRIVATE DATA AVAILABLE, WE HAVE A LOT OF THAT NOW THAT FEEDS INTO WALL STREET. JOE: SHOULD WE HAVE MONTHLY JOBS REPORTS? PETER: NOT UNTIL WE GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT. IF I WERE TO GO IN AND TRY TO DEAL WITH THAT, THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE. JOE: WOULD YOU TELL THE PRESIDENT THAT? PETER: I'D TELL HIM RIGHT NOW WATCHING YOUR SHOW. THE POINT HERE JOE IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE ARC OF THE BLS DATA GOING BACK TO 2018, THEY CONSISTENTLY GOT THINGS WRONG IN WAYS WHICH PUNISHED TRUMP. IT IS VERY CLEAR. THE 2018 TAX WAS WORKING BEAUTIFULLY AND HAD BAD DATA THAT SAID IT WASN'T. IN THE BIDEN YEARS, THEY CREATED A MILLION PHANTOM JOBS THAT THEY HAD TO ERASE AFTER DONALD TRUMP GOT ELECTED IN FEBRUARY 2025. JOE: THAT WAS THE AUGUST REVISION. AUGUST 2024. PETER: YES, BUT THEY DIDN'T COMPLETE THE WHOLE WIPEOUT UNTIL FEBRUARY. JOE: I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT JAY POWELL, THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE MIGHT SUE HIM. PETER: COME ON. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER FROM JAY POWELL. HECK YES. HE GETS YOUR ATTENTION. WHAT IS HE DOING THERE? HE IS SPENDING TAXPAYER MONEY, NOT WATCHING COSTS. CONTRAST WITH THEM THE WAY DONALD TRUMP DOES THINGS. HE IS GOING THROUGH MAJOR RENOVATION. GETTING A NEW AIR FORCE ONE WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEED, HE NEGOTIATED PERSONALLY WITH BOEING AND BROUGHT THE PRICE DOWN BY A LOT OF MONEY. POWELL HAS HAD THREE MAJOR BLUNDERS. JOE: LASTLY, IS THIS THE MOST RECENT ATTEMPT TO GET HIM TO LEAVE? PETER: I'M NOT GETTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT. WHAT HE IS DOING LIKE THE BLS, HE IS GIVING US BAD INFORMATION AND THEN MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON THE BAD INFORMATION. TARIFF UNCERTAINTY. THERE IS NO UNCERTAINTY. GET WITH THE PROGRAM. JOE: YOU CALLED THE FED CHAIR, DUDE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. [LAUGHTER] PETER, THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS COMING OVER TO TALK TO US. THE PRESIDENT OF LONG NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO THE NATION'S CAPITAL. HOW OTHER U.S. CITIES ARE BRACING FOR IMPACT ON THEIR COMMUNITIES. NOW THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS EXTENDED THE TARIFF TRUCE, WE WILL DISCUSS WITH A FORMER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL THAT IS NEXT ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. \u266a > > TARIFFS ARE NOT THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS. THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN BATTLE TESTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS BUT I DON'T WANT TO UNDERESTIMATE CORPORATIONS' ABILITY TO ADAPT. > > IF THESE TARIFFS PERSIST STILL INTO Q4 THAT IS WHEN WE WILL SEE MORE OF THE IMPACT. > > THE MARKET IS BEGINNING TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE MAUDLIN WHEN IT COMES TO INFLATION EXPECTATIONS. JOE: THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE ECONOMIC VOICES FROM EARLIER TODAY ON THIS CPI DAY. WITH THIS PERSPECTIVE ON TRADE DEALS, THE FORMER U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS WITH US LIVE ON BLOOMBERG. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. WE TOOK QUITE A DIVE WITH PETER NAVARRO ON THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS OR NOT ACCORDING TO TODAY'S CPI. A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE TO CREEP INTO HARD DATA. SOME PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT TODAY'S REPORT AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THIS IS PROOF TARIFFS ARE NOT INFLATIONARY. > > I THINK IT IS TOO EARLY TO CALL IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IN THAT THE TARIFFS REALLY WENT INTO EFFECT AUGUST 1. SOME HAVE BEEN DELAYED, THE CHINA ONES HAVE BEEN DELAYED FURTHER. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FULL EFFECT OF TARIFFS ARE GOING TO BE. WE ARE MOVING TO WHERE THE RATE IS ABOUT 18% IN TOTAL. THAT DIFFERENCE IS GOING TO BE EATEN SOMEWHERE. SOME MIGHT BE EATING FROM THE EXPORTING BUSINESS. SOME MIGHT BE EATEN BY THE IMPORTER AND THAT WILL SHOW UP IN EARNINGS AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT ALREADY IN SOME CASES. SOME WILL GET PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER AND WE HAVE SEEN CORE CPI TAKE UP. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS BUT I THINK IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL. THERE TENDS TO BE A LAG BETWEEN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TARIFFS AND THE INFLATIONARY EFFECT. I WOULDN'T BE TERRIBLY COMPLACENT RIGHT NOW. I THINK I WOULD BE IN A WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE. JOE: THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A COMPLACENT FED AT THE MOMENT, RESISTING CALLS TO CUT INTEREST RATES FROM THE PRESIDENT AND WE ARE WAITING FOR TRADE DEALS TO BE COMPLETED. CHINA IS THE BIG ONE, WE JUST GOT ANOTHER 90 DAYS AND I WONDER YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHERE THIS STANDS RIGHT NOW. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE BACK-AND-FORTH WITH THE AI CHIPMAKERS. 90 DAYS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO STRIKE A TRADE DEAL WITH THE WORLD'S SECOND-LARGEST ECONOMY, IS IT? > > IT DEPENDS ON WHAT DEALS THEY HAVE IN MIND. WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES UNDERLYING THE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP DEALT WITH, THE KIND OF REFORMS YOU WANT TO SEE AND CHINA TO MOVE TOWARD A MORE CONSUMER DEMAND LET ECONOMY, LESS RELIANT ON SUBSIDIES, WE HAVE TRIED WITH CHINA TO GET THEM TO CHANGE THEIR POLICIES I WOULD SAY WITH ONLY MODEST SUCCESS. THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION TOOK A DIFFERENT APPROACH, BASICALLY TO NEGOTIATE A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT. THE CHINESE BOUGHT ABOUT 50% OF WHAT THEY COMMITTED TO. THEY DIDN'T REALLY FULFILL WHAT THEY HAD AGREED TO. THE QUESTION FOR THE SECOND TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS WILL THEY GO BACK TO A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT OR DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING ISSUES? IS THERE A WAY OF USING LEVERAGE TO GET THE CHINESE TO REALLY BEGIN TO THINK THROUGH CHANGING THEIR ECONOMIC STRATEGY. WITH EXPORT CONTROLS, THAT IS A DIFFICULT AND DISTURBING TREND. THEY HAVE SAID THIS TECHNOLOGY IS SO CRITICAL TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY WE WILL NOT ALLOW IT TO BE SOLD TO OUR ADVERSARIES IN ITERIS. IT HAS NOT BEEN USED IN THE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. NOW YOU ARE SAYING WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC INTEREST BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN SELLING MORE AND MORE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A 15% REVENUE SHARE. THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL NEW VIEW ON THE ROLE OF EXPORT CONTROLS. JOE: QUESTIONS RAISED LAST EVENING WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ON THE HOUSE CHINA SELECT COMMITTEE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS 15% ARRANGEMENT, HERE IS WHAT HE SAID. > > FIRST THING THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF NEEDS TO DO IS PROTECT OUR COUNTRY SO WHEN HE BASICALLY SAYS OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS FOR SALE, THAT OUR CROWN JEWELS CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH SOME KIND OF REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, THAT IS A HORRIBLE SIGN TO OUR ADVERSARIES. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NEXT? SELL AIRCRAFT CARRIERS TO THE CHINESE AND THE GOVERNMENT TAKES A 20% CUT? THIS IS HORRIBLE, WE SHOULD NOT BE ENGAGED IN THE SALE OF THESE H20 CHIPS TO THE CCP. JOE: IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHERE THE LINE IS ON THIS. I DON'T THINK WE ARE ABOUT TO SELL AIRCRAFT CARRIERS TO THE CHINESE, BUT COULD THIS BE EXTENDED TO OTHER COMPANIES AND INDUSTRIES? MICHAEL: I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. MAKE SURE THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR WAY TO CHINA. THAT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO GET OTHER ALLIES ON BOARD. IF THEY ARE GOING TO RESTRICT THEIR EXPORTERS, THEY WANT TO KNOW THE U.S. IS GOING TO DO THE SAME THING. I WOULD HOPE THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY PEOPLE WILL STEP IN AND SAY THIS EITHER IS OR IS NOT CRITICAL TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND IF IT IS, LET'S MAKE SURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE CONTROLS AROUND IT. JOE: SMALL YARD WITH THE HIGH FENCE. THE FORMER USTR IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. NOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DEPLOYED HUNDREDS OF NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. , HOW OTHER CITIES ARE BRACING FOR POTENTIAL ACTION WHEN WE SPEAK WITH TWO MAYORS NEXT. PRES. TRUMP: WE WILL HAVE FULL, SEAMLESS, INTEGRATED COOPERATION AT ALL LEVELS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE WILL DEPLOY OFFICERS ACROSS THE DISTRICT WITH AN OVERWHELMING PRESENCE. YOU WILL HAVE MORE POLICE AND YOU WILL BE SO HAPPY. YOU WILL SEE FBI AGENT'S ON THE STREET. YOU WILL HAVE A LOT OF ESSENTIALLY MILITARY AND WE WILL BRING IN THE MILITARY IF IT IS NEEDED BY THE WAY. JOE: THIS IS A BALANCE -- THIS IS BALANCE OF POWER. PRESIDENT TRUMP YESTERDAY ANNOUNCING FEDERAL CONTROL OF WASHINGTON, D.C. POLICE AND DEPLOYING NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS. IS THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME IN CITIES NATIONWIDE? WE WILL HAVE A LOOK FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TONIGHT AND WE KICK OFF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE DEMOCRATIC MAYOR OF HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT, MAYOR, GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN ACTION IN WASHINGTON, IT'S A PLEASURE. HE HAS SINGLED OUT CITIES LIKE CHICAGO AND NEW YORK AS POTENTIALLY NEEDING ASSISTANCE LIKE THIS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHAT WOULD BE YOUR REACTION TO SEEING THE FEDERALIZATION OF YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENT OR NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS ON THE STREETS OF HARTFORD? > > IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU, THANKS FOR HAVING ME. LET'S START WITH SOME HONEST FACTS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON. D.C. HAS HAD HISTORIC LOWS AND VIOLENT CRIME, THE LOWEST NUMBERS IN ABOUT 30 YEARS. NASHVILLE, BALTIMORE, CLEVELAND. THE CITY OF FRESNO. I KNOW YOU ARE HAVING HIM ON AND A MOMENT AND HE IS A GOOD FRIEND. IN HARTFORD WE HAD THE LOWEST NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS ON RECORD IN THE CITY OF HARTFORD. WE ARE MAKING REAL GAINS IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT SHOULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR A PRESIDENT WHO CAMPAIGNED ON LAW AND ORDER AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THAT SHOULD BE GOOD NEWS. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE AND STEAD OF CALLING AND SAYING, HOW DID YOU GET THESE HISTORIC LOWS? INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE MAYOR OF D.C. TO ASK HOW DID YOU BRING DOWN VIOLENT CRIME 30%? HE HAS SLASHED PUBLIC SAFETY FUNDING, HE HAS DEFUNDED OUR POLICE. THIS BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL HAS CUT DOLLARS TO LAW-ENFORCEMENT LOCALLY, TO FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS WE KNOW ARE WORKING. IT IS ALMOST LIKE HE WOKE UP AND HAD NOTHING TO SAY FOR HIS CAMPAIGNING ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE ONLY ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING IT DONE ARE MAYORS TO CREATE SAFER AND HEALTHIER CITIES, BETTER CITIES AND MORE SAFE CITIES. MAYORS ARE REALLY GETTING THINGS DONE. INSTEAD OF ENGAGING US MAYORS AND ASKING WHAT THEY CAN DO BETTER AND HOW THEY CAN SUPPORT THE EFFORTS THAT ARE WORKING, INSTEAD OF TALKING TO US MAYORS AND MANY HAPPEN TO BE DEMOCRATS BUT WE JUST WANT WHAT IS BEST FOR A RESIDENTS. INSTEAD THEY HAVE SLASHED PUBLIC SAFETY FUNDING AND ENGAGE IN THIS DISTRACTION THAT IS FRANKLY UNNECESSARY, CHAOTIC, AND DANGEROUS. JOE: YOU HAVE ISOLATED PUBLIC SAFETY FUNDING AS AN ISSUE. THAT IS DULY NOTED. I WANT TO GET TO WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE RIGHT OR WRONG WITH THE DEPLOYMENT OF NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS, THE FEDERALIZATION OF THE POLICE. I'M LOOKING AT THE SAME DATA AND I'VE LIVED IN WASHINGTON FOR A MINUTE. I REALIZE THERE HAVE BEEN PRETTY GREAT STRIDES MADE SINCE 2023 WHEN THINGS LIKE CARJACKINGS WERE REALLY PEEKING AROUND HERE. I STILL DON'T FEEL SAFE. I MIGHT NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A COUPLE OF OFFICERS AND A CRUISER ON THE CORNER HERE. IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH THE OPTICAL IMPACT OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING? > > YES, LET ME BE CLEAR, WE HAVE SO MUCH LEFT TO GO. ANY ONE PERSON GETTING SHOT, HAVING THEIR CAR STOLEN, EXPERIENCING THE TRAUMA OF CRIME IS ONE TOO MANY AND WE WANT TO CREATE BETTER SOLUTIONS. THE MAYOR YOU WERE GOING TO TALK TO AN A MOMENT WAS A POLICE OFFICER HIMSELF AND HE WILL TELL YOU POLICE OFFICERS RECEIVE DIFFERENT TRAINING THAN THE NATIONAL GUARD DOES. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO CUT FUNDING TO ACTUAL POLICE OFFICERS IN OUR CITY, THOSE IN OUR CITIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY WORKING TO REDUCE CRIME. TO STOP THE PROGRESS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND THEN TALK ABOUT BRINGING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD. INSTEAD OF FINDING THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE WORKING AND THEN THEY TALK ABOUT BRINGING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD WHO HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT INSTANCES. JOE: HAVE YOU ASKED THE WHITE HOUSE FOR EXTRA FUNDING OR AN EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL? > > LOOK IN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WE HAD REAL CONVERSATIONS AND THEY ASKED US WHAT WE NEED WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC SAFETY. I DON'T HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH ANYONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I THINK EVERY CITY HAS TRIED TO DEVELOP THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. WE WOULD LOVE TO TRY TO GET ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FUNDAMENTALLY, IT BOTHERS ME THAT THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO IS DEFUNDING POLICE, DEFUNDING DOLLARS GOING TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR CITIES AND COMMUNITIES, DEFUNDING THE DEA AND THE ATF AND ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE WORK CLOSELY WITH AND THEN TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY IN OUR MAJOR CITIES. YOU CAN'T CUT DOLLARS TO LAW-ENFORCEMENT AND EXPECT OUR CITIES TO BELIEVE YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WANTING TO HAVE SAFER AND STRONGER COMMUNITIES. JOE: IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. I WILL SAY WHETHER IT IS YOURSELF AS A DEMOCRAT OR THE REPUBLICAN MAYOR WE ARE ABOUT TO SPEAK WITH IT IS CLEAR THAT MAYORS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE LUXURIES OF POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH REALITY AND CONSTITUENTS. THE DEMOCRATIC MAYOR OF HARTFORD. AS WE PROMISED FROM A VIEW FROM ACROSS THE AISLE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE REPUBLICAN MAYOR OF FRESNO, CALIFORNIA. MR. MAYOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU AND MEET YOU TODAY ALONG WITH THE MAYOR OF HARTFORD WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU AND OF COURSE HE IS RIGHT, YOU WERE A POLICE OFFICER FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE YOU WERE A POLITICIAN, 40 YEARS IN THE FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT. 18 YEARS AS THE CHIEF OF POLICE. HIS PRESIDENT TRUMP AUGMENTING OR DISTRACTING? > > I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN WASHINGTON AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR TRUE CRIME NUMBERS OTHER THAN WHAT I READ IN THE NEWS BUT I DO KNOW OFTENTIMES THERE IS A DISTANCE BETWEEN CRIME RATES AND THE WAY PEOPLE FEEL IN A COMMUNITY. IT IS THE FEELING OF SAFETY THAT REALLY MATTERS. IN TERMS OF DEPLOYING THE NATIONAL GUARD OR ANY RESOURCES I CAN TELL YOU MY TIME AS A POLICE CHIEF I WELCOME THE PARTNERSHIPS, WHETHER THAT WAS ATF AND IT WAS DONE AT THE REQUEST OF MYSELF ASKING FOR THOSE ENTITIES TO COME IN. WE WOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT, JOINT TASK FORCE, UNIFIED COMMAND. THERE WAS GOOD COMMUNICATION BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS A COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP. TODAY WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN L.A. OR D.C. WITH THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE FEDERAL NATIONAL GUARD, IT WAS DONE OUTSIDE OF THE REQUEST OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. AND SO WHAT I HAVE FOUND OVER THE YEARS IS THAT CRIME IS NOT A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC ISSUE. EVERYONE WANTS TO FEEL SAFER. THE DEBATE OFTENTIMES IS HOW DO WE MAKE THEM FEEL SAFE? WE DEFINITELY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO NOT WANT TO BE SEEN AS AN OCCUPYING FORCE IN NEIGHBORHOODS. WE WANT TO BE SEEN AS A WELCOME PRESENCE AND WHEN WE ARE SEEN AS A WELCOME RESIDENCE IN NEIGHBORHOODS BY FOLKS, THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OPERATE, PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION THAT HELPS US TO SOLVE CRIMES, SOLVE SHOOTINGS. THAT IS WHAT WE STRIVE FOR. WE STRIVE TO HAVE A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR COMMUNITY AND SOMETIMES IF WE ARE SEEN AS AN OCCUPYING FORCE, I CAN TELL YOU THERE WILL BE AN ADVERSE EFFECT. JOE: WE ARE SHOWING SOME CRIME STATISTICS. RAPE, AGGRAVATED ASSAULT ALL DOWN. THERE WE HAVE THEM ON YOUR SCREEN. ROBBERY WAS UP A BIT BUT THAT IS A COMPOSITE IMPROVEMENT ACROSS THE BOARD HERE. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE LANGUAGE WE ARE HEARING FROM THE PRESIDENT, THE MAYOR OF HARTFORD SAYS HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHO TO CALL AND DOES NOT HAVE AN OPEN DIALOGUE WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT THE DATA SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. THE OPTICS ARE ANOTHER PART OF THIS. DOES IT HELP TO HAVE MORE UNIFORMED OFFICERS OR EVEN NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS WALKING THE STREETS TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL AS IF THEY ARE SAFER? > > JUST TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE CRIME NUMBERS, THAT IS ONLY COMPARING 2025 TO 2024. IN AMERICA IN 2020 AND 2021, VIOLENT CRIME SKYROCKETED, WE HAVE THE PANDEMIC, THE GEORGE -- GEORGE FLOYD MURDER. OUR HIGH MARK IN 2020, WE HAD 732 SHOOTINGS IN OUR CITY, TODAY WE HAVE 105 7.5 MONTHS THROUGH THE YEAR. WE HAD 13 MURDERS. IN 2020, WE HAD 74. WE ARE GOING IN A GOOD DIRECTION. THE QUESTION IS DO WE NEED IN FRESNO THE INCREASED PRESENCE OF NATIONAL GUARDSMEN? ABSOLUTELY NOT. DO THEY NEED THEM IN D.C.? BASED ON THE NUMBERS I SAW, I WOULD SAY NO. BUT I'M NOT A RESIDENT IN THAT CITY, BUT I WOULD SAY FROM A LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE AS A MAYOR OF FRESNO, I WOULD NOT WANT THE NATIONAL GUARD COMING INTO OUR CITY BECAUSE AT SOME POINT IN TIME THEY ARE GOING TO LEAVE. THE LOCAL JURISDICTION IS GOING TO BE THE ONE THAT HAS TO DEAL WITH WHATEVER FALLOUT THERE MAY BE TO BE ABLE TO REGAIN THE TRUST OF THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOU HAVE ON THE STREETS, IT IS THE STRATEGIES YOU UTILIZE WITH THOSE FOLKS TO COMBAT CRIME. I THINK IN AMERICAN POLICING TODAY WE ARE GOING IN A VERY GOOD DIRECTION. JOE: IT IS REALLY INTERESTING TO HEAR YOU SAY ALL OF THAT AND IT BRINGS US BACK TO MY ORIGINAL QUESTION, MR. MAYOR. THAT THE INTRODUCTION OR THE FEDERALIZATION OF A LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT AND NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT DOING IT IN FRESNO, IT UNDERMINES LOCAL OFFICIALS. > > WHATEVER WE DO BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT, IT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN A COOPERATIVE WAY. SHE SAID AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE. NOT NECESSARILY BUT HOW WE CAN COOPERATIVELY POLICE ARE CITIES. WE HAVE DONE THAT MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS. THERE WILL BE SOME MIDDLE GROUND THEY CAN FIND IN D.C.. CERTAINLY IN FRESNO WE ARE DOING FINE RIGHT NOW. I KNOW WHO TO CALL TO GET FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO COME INTO THE CITY. JOE: THE FORMER POLICE CHIEF AND OUR REPUBLICAN MAYOR OF FRESNO, CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. WE WILL ASSEMBLE OUR POLITICAL PANEL NEXT ON BALANCE OF POWER ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. \u266a JOE: THIS IS BALANCE OF POWER ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. STORIES WE ARE WATCHING TODAY'S POWER BRIEF. PERPLEXITY IS MAKING A FORMAL OFFICER -- OFFER TO ACQUIRE GOOGLE CHROME FOR MORE THAN $34 BILLION. GOOGLE DID NOT RESPOND. PERPLEXITY HAS PREVIOUSLY SOUGHT TO ATTRACT USERS FROM GOOGLE WITH ITS SEARCH POWERED BY AI. LAST YEAR, A FEDERAL JUDGE RULED GOOGLE HAS AN ILLEGAL NAPOLI IN INTERNET SEARCH. AMONG THE PROPOSED CHANGES IS SELLING OFF THE CHROME BROWSER. DAVID SOLOMON IS THE LATEST EXECUTIVE TO FACE THE IRE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO SAID THE BANKER WAS WRONG ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS ON MARKETS AND CONSUMER COSTS. THE PRESIDENT SAID DAVID SOLOMON AND GOLDMAN SACHS REFUSED TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE. THEY WERE WRONG. JUST LIKE THEY ARE WRONG ABOUT SO MUCH ELSE. TRUMP DID NOT SPECIFY WHY HE WAS UPSET ABOUT THE BANK BUT HIS COMMENTS FOLLOW GUIDANCE FROM THE FIRM PUBLISHED SUNDAY. HE SUGGEST DAVID SOLOMON GO SPEND TIME WORKING AS A DJ. GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IS THE LATEST UNIVERSITY TARGETED OVER PRO-PALESTINE PROTESTS. THEY ACCUSED THEM OF VIOLATING FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAW AND SAID THE SCHOOL WAS DELIBERATELY IN DIFFERENT TO ALLEGED ANTI-SEMITIC HARASSMENT DURING DEMONSTRATIONS. WHILE THE DOJ DID NOT SAY WHAT IT WOULD PROCEED, FUNDING FREEZES AND SUBSEQUENT NEGOTIATIONS RESULTED FROM OTHER SCHOOLS. GEORGE WASHINGTON SAYS THEY CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITISM. I SPOKE WITH PETER NAVARRO WHO SAID SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE U.S. NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT RISING COSTS BECAUSE THEY WON'T PAY THE TARIFF COSTS. > > THE REASON WHY WE ARE NOT SEEING INFLATION BECAUSE OF THE TARIFFS IS BECAUSE IT IS THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT ARE EATING THE TARIFFS. FOREIGN COUNTRIES, THE BIG ONES WE RUN TRADE DEFICITS WITH, IF THEY CAN'T SELL TO US, THEY ARE IN TROUBLE. JOE: JOINING US NOW ARE OUR POLITICAL PANEL. MEGAN HAYES IS BACK WITH US ALONGSIDE , I WILL START WITH YOU , YOU HEARD THE CASE MADE FROM PETER NAVARRO SAYING YOU KEEP PREDICTING INFLATION BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. IS TODAY'S REPORT VINDICATION? > > I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE AND A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE WAITING TO SEE. THESE INDICATORS SHOW THAT THEY ARE LAGGING INDICATORS, SO A LOT OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT IS REALLY WHAT WE ARE WAITING FOR. I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE FOLKS AROUND TOWN TOUTING THESE TARIFFS AND POLICIES WILL FEEL AS IF TODAY IS A GOOD SIGN THINGS ARE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I THINK THE REST OF INDUSTRY AND MANUFACTURING, THEY ARE WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHOE TO DROP. JOE: THAT IS THE PROBLEM, DATA CAN SAY ANYTHING. IF PEOPLE FEEL DIFFERENTLY, THAT IS WHAT MATTERS. WHEN YOU CONTINUE THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS , THE UNCERTAINTY, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? > > I THINK IT WILL IMPACT THE MIDTERMS AND WAYS REPUBLICANS ARE NOT EXPECTING. THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE BUYING REAL GOODS. THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY FOLLOWING THE JOBS OR INFLATION NUMBERS. JUST HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH THAT IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER. JOE: INTERESTING WHEN WE CONSIDER TRADE WITH CHINA WHICH IS A BIG PART OF THE STORY. THEY HAVE A 90 DAY EXTENSION AND THEY ARE LIVING UNDER TARIFFS RIGHT NOW, BUT THERE COULD BE A TRADE DEAL AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BUY AI CHIPS. THEY HAVE AGREED TO PAY 15% OF REVENUES. > > IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY 15%, HOW MUCH DO THEY SEE AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO WIN? THAT SEEMS TO ME LIKE WHERE THEY SEE OPPORTUNITY. IF THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY THAT KIND OF BOUNTY I SUSPECT THEIR SUSPICION AS THEY CAN MAKE QUITE A BIT MORE. JOE: SO THEY GET RICH BUT SHAREHOLDERS ARE SAYING WE BOUGHT A STOCK IN NVIDIA OR AMD AND NOBODY TOLD US 15% OF THE PROCEEDS ARE GOING TO THE GOVERNMENT. IS THAT A GOOD WAY TO DO BUSINESS? > > I WONDER IF THIS IS MAYBE THE WAY THINGS ARE HEADED AND THE WAY SHAREHOLDERS WILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY HOLD. JOE: I TALKED TO A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN WHO SAYS IT IS A BAD IDEA AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MEME COIN. > > THIS DEAL MAKES ME SHUDDER TO CONSIDER WHAT A TIKTOK DEAL MIGHT LOOK LIKE OR A TARIFF DEAL MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND AGAIN ORBITING AROUND THESE CONSIDERATIONS IS WHO IS BUYING THE TRUMP COIN? THIS IS THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF CORRUPTION OF HIS FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE. MORE THAN HALF OF HIS NET WORTH IS TIED UP IN HIS GOING -- COIN. THE QATARI, THE TURKS, THE VENEZUELANS PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN -- THE QATARIS, THE TURKS, THE VENEZUELANS PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN. JOE: THE CONGRESSMAN INTRODUCE THIS IDEA AND NVIDIA DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT ON THESE ASSERTIONS. HE AND ELIZABETH WARREN ARE READY TO GO ON THE MAT AND START AN INQUIRY. IS THIS THE OF ATTACK BY DEMOCRATS? I HAVE NOT HEARD THIS ANYWHERE BEFORE TODAY. > > I THINK THE CORRUPTION ISSUE IS A REAL PROBLEM FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WHEN YOU START TO SEE WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING AND TRUMP DOESN'T MAKE DEALS UNLESS IT BENEFITS HIM AND HIS FAMILY. THAT PLANE FROM QATAR WILL BENEFIT HIM LATER IN LIFE. THERE ARE QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE AND IT IS POLITICAL, BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY. I DO FEEL DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE GOT TO GET A HOLD OF THIS. JOE: IS THIS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED? I'M TRYING TO BE DELIBERATE ABOUT THIS. SHOULD THERE BE AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHO IS BUYING THE TRUMP MEME COIN IF THEY ARE INVESTING IN THE GOVERNMENT? > > I'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE, THIS IS NOT A NEW RUMOR. THE PROBLEM IS THAT CONGRESS IS NOT SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS, JUST LIKE WE ASKED MARK ZUCKERBERG TO COME TO D.C. TO TALK TO US ABOUT FACEBOOK NOT THAT LONG AGO. THE DIFFICULTY IS THESE ISSUES ARE SO COMPLEX AND ARE CONGRESSMAN DON'T HAVE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF IT THAT THEY WILL INVESTIGATED AND IT WILL GO NOWHERE IN WASHINGTON. JOE: BECAUSE THEY ARE DRIVING AROUND WITH EIGHT TRACK TAPES IN THEIR CARS. > > I DON'T THINK AGE IS A LACK OF SOPHISTICATION. WE ARE SO FAR BEHIND THE BALL ON REGULATING AI. THEY DON'T KNOW , BUT CORRUPTION IS THE FOREMOST PROBLEM IN OUR GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW AND THEY NEED TO BE DOING INVESTIGATIONS ON THIS. JOE: DOES THAT APPLY TO INSIDER TRADING IN CONGRESS? > > I THINK SO. JOE: BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE? THERE IS A DRIVE. > > ABSOLUTELY. JOE: WE APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHTS SO MUCH. SET YOUR CLOCK FOR THIS. TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT WILL BE JOINING BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE TOMORROW MORNING LIVE AT 7:30 A.M. EASTERN. TALKING ABOUT HIS NEW ROLE AS THE ACTING IRS COMMISSIONER. TODAY'S CPI DATA.
