  "content": "There are still plenty of notable Apple Labor Day deals still live in our master hub right here, but today\u2019s 9to5Toys Lunch Break does have some additional offers that should be on your radar. Firstly, we have an even lower price on the M4 Mac mini with 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage at $200 off the list price (now an additional $100 off). Next up we are taking a look at Apple\u2019s 1TB 11-inch M4 iPad Pro Wi-Fi + Cell model at a giant $500 off ahead of the upcoming padOS updates alongside the 1TB iPhone 15 Pro Max at $730 off ahead of the iPhone 17 reveal next week. All of that and more awaits down below.\n\nApple\u2019s 24GB M4 Mac mini with 1TB upgrade drops even lower at $200 off the list price\n\nB&H had a number of upgraded M4 Mac mini deals live ahead of Labor Day this year, but just about all of them jumped back up to full price over the long weekend. However, one of these models is now even lower than it was last week. You\u2019ll now find the latest M4 model configured with 24GB of RAM and the 1TB internal SSD at $200 off the list price.\n\nB&H is now offering the M4 Mac mini with 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage down at $999 shipped. That\u2019s $200 off the $1,199 list price you would pay at Apple, $100 under our previous mention, and the lowest we can find.\n\nThe most upgraded model you can find on Amazon is the 24GB variant with 512GB of RAM \u2013 you can\u2019t buy the model B&H has on sale here today there at all. And for the record, we have never seen the 24GB/512GB model at a full $200 off via Amazon and it very rarely ever goes for better than $100 off.\n\nClearly the real value in the M4 Mac mini lineup for most potential customers is the low price of entry, and you\u2019re not exactly getting that here with the $999 deal price on the 24GB/1TB \u2013 it is after all nearly double the price of the entry variant. But for folks looking to land something that will remain snappy and powerful for most likely years to come, or something to support more involved creative projects, there is some value in this rarely discounted configuration at $200 off the list price.\n\nM5 iPad Pro might be on the way, but 9to5 readers can score this M4 Pro at a giant $500 off\n\nWhile there are still some hangover Labor Day iPad deals up for grabs, like the $150 off most M3 iPad Air models, we wanted to shine a light on the exclusive iPad Pro offer we have secured for 9to5 readers. While the M5 lineup might very well be on the way sooner than later, it\u2019s going to be a very long time before you can score over $500 off one of those like we have here today.\n\nAll things considered, the M4 iPad Pro will likely remain a more than compelling tablet for quite some time, especially with upcoming padOS updates. We are pretty convinced that, with the upcoming iPadOS 26, chances are pro-grade iPads will come even closer to delivering a full-on computer experience than ever before, and today\u2019s deal will have you ready to do just that at a massive discount.\n\n9to5 readers can follow through any of the links in this post to land Apple\u2019s 1TB 11-inch M4 iPad Pro Wi-Fi + Cell modelwith the nano-texture glass down at $1,394.07 shipped. That\u2019s nearly $505 off the sticker price and the best we have tracked to date.\n\nWhen you click through it looks like the price is listed at $1,499, but if you scroll down and add it to your cart you\u2019ll see the special 9to5 pricing.\n\nYou\u2019re looking at an $1,899 configuration here that has never sold for less than $1,599 at Amazon where it is currently up at over $1,700. And, more realistically, it almost never drops below $1,699 and has only ever gone for less once.\n\nNeedless to say this is about as pricey as it is a giant discount. This sort of investment on an Apple tablet certainly isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you have been considering the flip from MacBook to iPad the way some 9to5 staffers already have, and with iPadOS 26 on the horizon, this is a deal worth consideration.\n\nApple will reveal iPhone 17 in one week, but this 1TB iPhone 15 Pro Max is almost $730 off (Renewed Premium)\n\nApple will officially unleash iPhone 17 in exactly one week from today at its upcoming \u201cAwe dropping\u201devent. But for those not interested in paying the premium Apple\u2019s latest and greatest will surely come along with \u2013 early leaks and reports suggest will be seeing a slight price increase this year too, Amazon Premium Renewed listings on the spec\u2019d out iPhone 15 Pro Max have dropped even lower. You can land one at nearly $730 off the original list price right now.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Premium Renewed listing on the 1TB iPhone 15 Pro Max in the Black Titanium colorway has now dropped to 871.90 shipped. That\u2019s still a pretty penny to drop down, but just remember we are talking about an Apple Intelligence-capable 1TB Pro Max iPhone here that originally fetched $1,599 at launch. This very same phone would have costed you over $1,600 with tax buying it straight from Apple in early September 2024.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not the iPhone 16 Pro, and we are less than 7 days from the reveal of the series 17 lineup, but the 15 Pro Max is still a more than capable device and you can land one at a giant discount right now \u2013 the difference in price between this 15 Pro Max listing and a comparable 17 Pro Max is almost as much as a brand new iPhone 17 standard.\n\nBlack 1TB iPhone 16 Pro now $470 off the list price ahead of 17 launch (Amazon Renewed Premium)\n\nApple\u2019s latest M3 iPad Air lineup at Amazon all-time low pricing, all models $150 off from $449\n\u2022 Anker 2025 Labor Day sale serving up to 45% off latest Nano chargers, MagSafe stands, more from just $10\n\u2022 This 7-in-1 USB-C hub has a hidden Type-C cable and adapter compartment, now $39.50 (Reg. $65)\n\u2022 This code slashes 40% off ORICO\u2019s metal USB 4 M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure with 40Gb/s transfer speeds, now $42\n\u2022 Lexar\u2019s tiny 1TB Go portable SSD adds 4K Apple Pro Res action to iPhone, and it\u2019s down to its lowest price today at $105\n\u2022 This originally $100 3-in-1 charging cube for your entire Apple kit just dropped to $22.50 low\n\nApple Labor Day deals: MacBook, iPhone up to $720 off, AirPods from $90, more\n\nM4 MacBook Air from $799 might be the best bang for your buck in Apple gear right now ($200 off)\n\nAmazon is still offering just about every single M4 MacBook Air configuration out there at the lowest we have tracked online. These deals have been live for quite some time now, but after detailing why we think they might be among the best Apple deals of the year, and considering they are the latest 2025 releases of one of the most universally appealing pieces of Apple kit in the lineup, they deserve to be front and center once again. This includes both the 13- and 15-inch models across all storage capacities and colors at $200 off with prices starting from $799 shipped.\n\nThere have been a few very short-lived, one-off disocunts on select models in particular colors for a touch less than we are seeing right now, but you are, by in large, looking at the best deals that have been offered online, and the best chance to land any of the configs/colors in the lineup with a sweet deal.\n\nOn top of what you might call the standard configurations listed above, we have also uncovered some $200 price drops outside of Amazon on configs you can\u2019t even buy there:\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that these are some of the best investments on an Apple laptop you can make right now in a couple different ways. Firstly, the MacBook Air, especially the latest generation that started at $100 less this year, is the most affordable way to bring home a new MacBook. And now with the new 16GB of RAM starter tier at $200 off the list price, you\u2019re really getting some bang for your buck.\n\nSecondly, you\u2019re getting a machine barely half way through its lifecycle, and that\u2019s if Apple upgrades them to the M5 chip next spring (it probably will). While we are tracking a gigantic collection of Apple gear on sale this weekend, the M4 MacBook Air is one of the only products in the sale that isn\u2019t likely to see a new model take the reigns sometime this fall. There are others, but the bulk of the big ticket gear will see new models land in the coming month(s).\n\nJBL introduces its new and rugged Grip portable Bluetooth speaker for preorder at $100\n\nHere are the LEGO sets releasing in September 2025 from Icons, Ideas, DC, Marvel, Disney, more + advent calendars and GWPs",

Its higher-end Renewed Premium list for the Black Titanium 1TB model has now dropped down to $1,029 shipped, or $470 off the new unlocked list price at Apple.\nWe have seen these 1TB models drop as low as $1,010 in the last few months, but deals on the black model at anywhere under $1,099 have been far and few between otherwise. Today\u2019s deal is the second-lowest price we have tracked on Amazon for this one, landing within $19 of the best price ever. Considering this is a regularly $1,499 configuration of Apple\u2019s latest and greatest, the difference is negligible at best.\nIt is also worth noting that the other three colors \u2013 Natural Titanium, White, and Desert Titanium \u2013 are also sitting at the same price as the black variant.\nNow, we are less than a month out from the reveal of iPhone 17, and more like a few weeks really, but these Renewed Premium offers at Amazon are a great way to land a new unlocked handset at dramatically lower prices. You\u2019re certainly not going to be scoring any major deals on iPhone 17 unless you have a relatively new device to trade-in against it, and we didn\u2019t see the 16 Pro deals pop up until well into the following year. If you must have the latest and greatest, then by all means hold out a few weeks, but if you\u2019re looking for a serious deal on an iPhone that will still feel new for at least another year, today\u2019s deal is worth a look.\nAlongside the 1-year warranty, you can get more details on the Amazon Renewed units below:\nAmazon Renewed is your trusted destination for pre-owned and refurbished products that are inspected and tested to work and look like new. Any repairs are made with Apple components that are new, or reused and in like-new condition. The products will have minimal to no signs of wear, no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away, batteries with at least 80% capacity relative to new, and may arrive in a brown or white box with relevant accessories (no headphones included) that may be generic.\n- This pre-owned product is not Apple certified, but has been professionally inspected, tested and cleaned by Amazon-qualified suppliers.\n- There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm\u2019s length. There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm\u2019s length.\n- This product will have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new.\n- Accessories will not be original, but will be compatible and fully functional.

      "text": "Update: This popular deal is still live. Details below in the original post.\nSpigen\u2019s 2025 Athlex Apple Watch band is one of the best new accessories I have had a chance to test out this year. There\u2019s certainly higher-end straps out there for your Apple wrist computer, but since quickly jumping in price shortly after launch, you can now land one of the most comfortable Apple Watch straps I have in my collection at under $22 Prime shipped at Amazon today.\nCourtesy of the brand\u2019s official Amazon storefront, you\u2019ll now find the Spigen Athlex Apple Watch brand down at $21.99 with free shipping for Prime members or in orders over $35. Today\u2019s deal includes all four colors as well: black, navy, green, and gray.\nAgain, this band launched at $20, but it quickly went out of stock for a short time in some colors and then carried a $25 list price without moving since mid April. Today, however, we are catching the first chance to save since on what I would consider to be one of the best bands you can buy for this price.\nThe first thing to say about this strap is that is has that Apple Trail Loop vibe at a fraction of the $99 one of those will run you. It\u2019s not quite as high-end as one of those overall, but for me it is a wonderful alternative for folks looking to side-step the Apple tax.\nThe next thing I would want to highlight for anyone considering picking one up is the wearing experience \u2013 this thing is incredibly comfortable to wear for me. I tend to favor metal bracelets and leather straps from brands like SANDMARC, Nomad, and Burton Goods, but on a hot day running errands, out for a walk, or even exercising, the Spigen Athlex strap has been a go-to for me for months now.\nAnything else I have to say about this band is, of course, waiting in my full Tested with 9to5Toys review you can check out right here.\nSpigen Athlex Apple Watch band features:\n- Premium Comfortable Fabric Band: Experience all-day comfort with a premium fabric band for your Apple Watch\n- Secure Hook and Loop Fastener: Easily adjust the fit and ensure a secure hold on your wrist with a sleek hook and loop fastener\n- Innovative Loop Design: Prevents accidental detachment when adjusting the band, so you get the perfect fit without any slips\n- Sporty Yellow Stitching: Add a pop of color to your wrist with our stylish yellow stitching for sporty accents on 3 unique colorways\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!"

You can land one at nearly $730 off the original list price right now.\nAmazon\u2019s Premium Renewed listing on the 1TB iPhone 15 Pro Max in the Black Titanium colorway has now dropped to 871.90 shipped. That\u2019s still a pretty penny to drop down, but just remember we are talking about an Apple Intelligence-capable 1TB Pro Max iPhone here that originally fetched $1,599 at launch. This very same phone would have costed you over $1,600 with tax buying it straight from Apple in early September 2024.\nIt\u2019s certainly not the iPhone 16 Pro, and we are less than 7 days from the reveal of the series 17 lineup, but the 15 Pro Max is still a more than capable device and you can land one at a giant discount right now \u2013 the difference in price between this 15 Pro Max listing and a comparable 17 Pro Max is almost as much as a brand new iPhone 17 standard.\nAmazon Renewed is your trusted destination for pre-owned and refurbished products that are inspected and tested to work and look like new.

Head below to get the rundown on what you\u2019ll be getting, as well as pricing and official release details.\nThe JBL Grip \u2013 \u201csmall in size, big on sound\u201d\nJBL\u2019s new Grip Portable Bluetooth Speaker comes along sporting a similar design to some past models, keeping to a more cylindrical IP68-rated design that provides audio how you want to listen to it, wherever you want to listen. Aside from the five bright colorways, the compact form factor also sports an integrated rope hook, making it easy to attach to backpacks, bikes, kayaks, and more for audio on the go. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s ambient lighting on its back panel, which you can customize to pair with your playlist through its companion app.\nThis new speaker comes equipped with the brand\u2019s AI Sound Boost, delivering even more power-driven and deeper bass without distortion issues, bolstered further by 16W of output and JBL Pro Sound.

      "text": "While there are still some hangover Labor Day iPad deals up for grabs, like the $150 off most M3 iPad Air models, we wanted to shine a light on the exclusive iPad Pro offer we have secured for 9to5 readers. While the M5 lineup might very well be on the way sooner than later, it\u2019s going to be a very long time before you can score over $500 off one of those like we have here today.\nAll things considered, the M4 iPad Pro will likely remain a more than compelling tablet for quite some time, especially with upcoming padOS updates. We are pretty convinced that, with the upcoming iPadOS 26, chances are pro-grade iPads will come even closer to delivering a full-on computer experience than ever before, and today\u2019s deal will have you ready to do just that at a massive discount.\n9to5 readers can follow through any of the links in this post to land Apple\u2019s 1TB 11-inch M4 iPad Pro Wi-Fi + Cell model with the nano-texture glass down at $1,394.07 shipped. That\u2019s nearly $505 off the sticker price and the best we have tracked to date.\nWhen you click through it looks like the price is listed at $1,499, but if you scroll down and add it to your cart you\u2019ll see the special 9to5 pricing.\nYou\u2019re looking at an $1,899 configuration here that has never sold for less than $1,599 at Amazon where it is currently up at over $1,700. And, more realistically, it almost never drops below $1,699 and has only ever gone for less once.\nNeedless to say this is about as pricey as it is a giant discount. This sort of investment on an Apple tablet certainly isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you have been considering the flip from MacBook to iPad the way some 9to5 staffers already have, and with iPadOS 26 on the horizon, this is a deal worth consideration.\nM4 iPad Pro features:\niPad Pro is the ultimate iPad experience in an impossibly thin and light design. Featuring the breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display, outrageous performance from the M4 chip, superfast wireless connectivity,* and compatibility with Apple Pencil Pro.* Plus powerful productivity features in iPadOS.

      "text": "Amazon is still offering just about every single M4 MacBook Air configuration out there at the lowest we have tracked online. These deals have been live for quite some time now, but after detailing why we think they might be among the best Apple deals of the year, and considering they are the latest 2025 releases of one of the most universally appealing pieces of Apple kit in the lineup, they deserve to be front and center once again. This includes both the 13- and 15-inch models across all storage capacities and colors at $200 off with prices starting from $799 shipped.\nThere have been a few very short-lived, one-off disocunts on select models in particular colors for a touch less than we are seeing right now, but you are, by in large, looking at the best deals that have been offered online, and the best chance to land any of the configs/colors in the lineup with a sweet deal.\n- 13-inch M4 MacBook Air 16GB/256GB $799 (Reg. $999)\n- 13-inch M4 MacBook Air 16GB/512GB $999 (Reg. $1,199)\n- 13-inch M4 MacBook Air 24GB/512GB $1,199 (Reg. $1,399)\n- 15-inch M4 MacBook Air 16GB/256GB $999 (Reg. $1,199)\n- 15-inch M4 MacBook Air 16GB/512GB $1,199 (Reg. $1,399)\n- 15-inch M4 MacBook Air 24GB/512GB $1,399 (Reg. $1,599)\nOn top of what you might call the standard configurations listed above, we have also uncovered some $200 price drops outside of Amazon on configs you can\u2019t even buy there:\nIt is also worth mentioning that these are some of the best investments on an Apple laptop you can make right now in a couple different ways. Firstly, the MacBook Air, especially the latest generation that started at $100 less this year, is the most affordable way to bring home a new MacBook. And now with the new 16GB of RAM starter tier at $200 off the list price, you\u2019re really getting some bang for your buck.\nSecondly, you\u2019re getting a machine barely half way through its lifecycle, and that\u2019s if Apple upgrades them to the M5 chip next spring (it probably will). While we are tracking a gigantic collection of Apple gear on sale this weekend, the M4 MacBook Air is one of the only products in the sale that isn\u2019t likely to see a new model take the reigns sometime this fall. There are others, but the bulk of the big ticket gear will see new models land in the coming month(s).\nApple M4 MacBook Air features:\n- SPEED OF LIGHTNESS \u2014 MacBook Air with the M4 chip lets you blaze through work and play. With Apple Intelligence, up to 18 hours of battery life, and an incredibly portable design, you can take on anything, anywhere.\n- SUPERCHARGED BY M4 \u2014 The Apple M4 chip brings even more speed and fluidity to everything you do, like working between multiple apps, editing videos, or playing graphically demanding games.\n- BUILT FOR APPLE INTELLIGENCE \u2014 Apple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system that helps you write, express yourself, and get things done effortlessly. With groundbreaking privacy protections, it gives you peace of mind that no one else can access your data \u2014 not even Apple.\n- UP TO 18 HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE \u2014 MacBook Air delivers the same incredible performance whether it\u2019s running on battery or plugged in.\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!"

      "text": "It\u2019s been an exciting summer for LEGO, as we\u2019ve seen massive waves of new building sets release over the last few months with regular unveilings of new sets happening in between. Following the 107 new releases we saw hit the scene last month, September is geared up to be a much smaller event, though one stacked with plenty of standouts that already have builders champing at the bits \u2013 with some already available to preorder too. Of course, there are four different Gift With Purchase rewards that will be popping up for Harry Potter and the recently revealed Pirates of the Caribbean sets. You can get the full rundown below and start planning (or preordering) what will be joining your collection once the clock ticks over to September.\nWhile it may not be a massive blowout like August, September is sure to be another exciting month of new releases from the LEGO Group, with notable standouts like the LEGO Icons Captain Jack Sparrow\u2019s Pirate Ship (Black Pearl) \u2013 which gets one of the four GWP sets tagging along, as well as others like the 76300 Batman Arkham Asylum set, the 21360 Ideas Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory set, and plenty more to wet your brick-shaped whistles.\nAs usual, LEGO Insiders will have the first access to these new releases once the clock officially turns us over into September, with general admissions opening a few days after. You may notice a few sets not becoming available until later in the month, so be sure to make a note for those particular releases and plan accordingly.\nAs I already mentioned, there are four potential GWP rewards to take advantage of on two very specific themes. The first of these is Captain Jack Sparrow\u2019s Compass that will be accompanying the LEGO Icons Captain Jack Sparrow\u2019s Pirate Ship (Black Pearl) set through September 18 (as the main set doesn\u2019t release until September 15). From there, Harry Potter fans can score three different GWP sets \u2013 one of which accompanies a building set, while the other two are acquired via a $40 or $130 pricing threshold being hit while buying the theme\u2019s latest sets.\nHead below to see our curated list of all the new LEGO sets releasing in September 2025:\nLEGO Advent Calendar September 2025 releases\n- Friends Advent Calendar: $34.99 shipped | 237 pieces\n- City Advent Calendar: $34.99 shipped | 186 pieces\n- Disney Frozen Advent Calendar: $44.99 shipped | 231 pieces\n- Harry Potter Advent Calendar: $44.99 shipped | 278 pieces\n- Minecraft Advent Calendar: $44.99 shipped | 300 pieces\n- Star Wars\u2122 Advent Calendar: $44.99 shipped | 263 pieces\nLEGO DC & Marvel September 2025 releases\n- Batman \u2013 Arkham Asylum: $299.99 shipped | 2,593 pieces\n- Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Minifigure: $4.99 shipped | 8 pieces\n- Spider-Man \u2013 Across the Spider-Verse Minifigure 6-pack: $29.94 shipped | 97 pieces\nLEGO Disney September 2025 releases\n- WALL-E and EVE: $69.99 shipped | 811 pieces\nLEGO Harry Potter September 2025 releases\n- Hogsmeade Village \u2013 Collectors\u2019 Edition: $399.99 shipped | 3,228 pieces\n- The Goblet of Fire BrickHeadz Figures: $49.99 shipped | 671 pieces\n- Luna Lovegood & Thestral Brickheadz Figures: $19.99 shipped | 292 pieces\nLEGO Icons and Ideas September 2025 releases\n- Captain Jack Sparrow\u2019s Pirate Ship (Black Pearl): $379.99 shipped | 2,862 pieces\n- Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory: $219.99 shipped | 2,025 pieces\nLEGO Nike September 2025 releases\n- Nike Slam Dunk: $69.99 shipped | 809 pieces\n- Nike Dunk Trickshot: $39.99 shipped | 454 pieces\nLEGO Wicked September 2025 releases\n- Emerald City Wall Art: $159.99 shipped | 1,518 pieces\n- Glinda & Elphaba Bookends: $129.99 shipped | 1,327 pieces\n- Emerald City & Kiamo Ko Castle: $79.99 shipped | 860 pieces\n- Glinda & Elphaba Visit Munchkinland: $69.99 shipped | 734 pieces\n- Glinda\u2019s Wedding Day: $39.99 shipped | 476 pieces\n- Elphaba\u2019s Retreat: $27.99 shipped | 228 pieces\n- Elphaba & Glinda Brickheadz Figures: $19.99 shipped | 325 pieces\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!"

      "text": "Now roughly 48 hours out from one of the most highly-anticipated game releases of the year, Team Cherry has issued a final Kickstarter update on Hollow Knight: Silksong. It just recently confirmed the GameStop price leak at $19.99 here in the U.S. across what appears to be all platforms (as well as the launch times on September 4), but what does this mean for Nintendo Switch 2?\nHollow Knight: Silksong is now confirmed to be launching at a surprisingly low $19.99 here in the U.S. across all platforms by the looks of it. This includes Switch, PS4/5, on Steam, GoG, Humble Bundle, and Xbox (it is a day 1 Game Pass title for the record).\nThat GameStop listing that quickly appeared and promptly disappeared was the first to \u201cleak\u201d the price of the game, and it turned out to be correct.\nRelease times:\n7AM PT | 10AM ET | 4PM CEST | 11PM JST\nGame price:\nUSD $19.99 | EUR \u20ac19.99 | JPY \u00a52300\nI think many folks had a feeling Team Cherry might be incredibly generous with the price of a game it could have easily charged double for, but $20 is impressively low, even for them.\nNonetheless that is official, and the development team has now updated its ancient Kickstarter page for the original Hollow Knight with some details for early backers.\nIf you haven\u2019t done so already, please fill out your survey so we can deliver your keys!\nNote: A few backers have reported finding their survey in their junk folder, so please do check there if it hasn\u2019t shown up. If you can\u2019t find it, shoot us an email at backers@teamcherry.com.au, mention your email address, or your backer name & number, and we\u2019ll get a survey out to you asap.\nSurveys will close in 24hours from now. If you do miss the cut-off, don\u2019t worry! You can still receive your Silksong keys, but you\u2019ll have to contact us directly through backers@teamcherry.com.au.\nEveryone who has already filled out the survey, keys will arrive shortly before release.\nSteam keys will arrive via Humble Bundle and will include the Official Soundtrack for all players.\nNintendo Switch keys will be delivered directly via email.\nBut here\u2019s the interesting part: those who receive a key for the Switch version will have to download the game as expected and additionally \u201cdownload the (free) Hollow Knight: Silksong Upgrade Pack from the eShop to unlock the platform\u2019s enhanced features.\u201d\nThis looks to just be for those receiving the game via the Kickstarter campaign, and that you will be able to just buy the game straight for Nintendo Switch 2 directly on the eShop (as opposed to downloading the Switch 1 version and the aforementioned \u201c(free) Hollow Knight: Silksong Upgrade Pack\u201d).\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!"

      "text": "B&H had a number of upgraded M4 Mac mini deals live ahead of Labor Day this year, but just about all of them jumped back up to full price over the long weekend. However, one of these models is now even lower than it was last week. You\u2019ll now find the latest M4 model configured with 24GB of RAM and the 1TB internal SSD at $200 off the list price.\nB&H is now offering the M4 Mac mini with 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage down at $999 shipped. That\u2019s $200 off the $1,199 list price you would pay at Apple, $100 under our previous mention, and the lowest we can find.\nThe most upgraded model you can find on Amazon is the 24GB variant with 512GB of RAM \u2013 you can\u2019t buy the model B&H has on sale here today there at all. And for the record, we have never seen the 24GB/512GB model at a full $200 off via Amazon and it very rarely ever goes for better than $100 off.\nClearly the real value in the M4 Mac mini lineup for most potential customers is the low price of entry, and you\u2019re not exactly getting that here with the $999 deal price on the 24GB/1TB \u2013 it is after all nearly double the price of the entry variant. But for folks looking to land something that will remain snappy and powerful for most likely years to come, or something to support more involved creative projects, there is some value in this rarely discounted configuration at $200 off the list price.\nM4 Mac mini features:\nThe far mightier, way tinier Mac mini desktop computer is five by five inches of pure power. Built for Apple Intelligence. Redesigned around Apple silicon to unleash the full speed and capabilities of the spectacular M4 Pro chip. With ports at your convenience, on the front and back. At just five by five inches, Mac mini is designed to fit perfectly next to a monitor and is easy to place just about anywhere. Get connected with Thunderbolt, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back and, for the first time, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack.\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!"
