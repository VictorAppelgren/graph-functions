  "content": "Billionaires often see what others miss. Yet Robert Rosenkranz embraces a philosophy of life that's hardly a secret.\n\nRosenkranz, 83, applies his knowledge of Stoicism to understand and navigate the world around him. Guided by Stoic philosophers such as Marcus Aurelius and Seneca, he puts their principles into practice.\n\nRosenkranz made an early fortune in private equity. Currently chairman of Delphi Capital Management, he spent 31 years as chief executive of its parent company, Delphi Financial Group.\n\nEven though he's a self-described \"natural born Stoic,\" he spent most of his life without deep knowledge of this philosophy. In his 60s, however, he learned how Stoics lived and what they believed.\n\n\"Once I started reading the Stoics about 15 years ago, it gave me a kind of framework,\" Rosenkranz told IBD. \"I recognized it was so resonant to my life.\"\n\nStoic principles include using reason to govern emotions, managing time wisely and attaining virtue by contributing to the greater good. The ability to focus on what's essential \u2014 and doing it well \u2014 affords more peace of mind than expending time and effort on what's not necessary.\n\nThe principles are easy to grasp but often hard to follow. For example, the Stoics sought to distinguish facts from interpretations.\n\n\"I find separating facts from impressions can be difficult to apply,\" Rosenkranz said. \"You come to a conclusion and think it's right. But you want to step back and ask, 'Are there any other conclusions that are plausible?'\"\n\nThe act of stepping back breeds humility: You realize that your perceptions are just one of many possible interpretations. It also spurs more accurate, logical, fact-based analysis.\n\nRosenkranz spent two years writing a memoir that elucidates Stoic philosophy. In his book, \"The Stoic Capitalist,\" he also highlights pivotal moments in his eventful life \u2014 from his childhood to his career as a financier and philanthropist.\n\nBet Big On Your Future Like Rosenkranz\n\nDecades before his interest in the Stoics, Rosenkranz was already acting like one. He just didn't know it.\n\nAt 35, he had a lucrative job as a partner at an investment firm. In a meeting with Joe Mailman, a wealthy business titan, he explored launching a private equity firm with Mailman's backing.\n\nRejecting a conventional arrangement, Rosenkranz offered to risk all his liquid net worth \u2014 $400,000 \u2014 and forgo any carried interest in exchange for 50% of the profits. He also agreed to absorb 50% of the losses.\n\n\"My suggestion would make our interests symmetrical: heads we both win, tails we both lose,\" he writes in his book.\n\nRosenkranz calls his proposal the most courageous business decision he's ever made. Given his highly leveraged position, he figured he had a one-in-three chance of losing the $400,000.\n\nOn the other hand, he set similar odds of great success. With the $4 million stake that Mailman would initially provide, Rosenkranz thought he had a one-in-three chance of generating $100 million in profit.\n\nThey agreed to the deal and it changed Rosenkranz's life. \"There was a huge amount of fear,\" he recalled.\n\nTo overcome that fear, he embodied the Stoics. He favored rationality over emotion \u2014 and mustered the courage to take action informed by reason.\n\nHis negotiation with Mailman followed the Stoics' blueprint. Rather than get flustered when the discussion took an unpredictable turn, he says he was able to \"separate people from the problem.\"\n\nAdopting a rational mindset, he sought to forge an agreement built on mutual gain. Listening attentively to Mailman helped him find a win-win solution.\n\nRegulating your emotions, especially negative ones, requires discipline. That doesn't come naturally to many people.\n\n\"Robert seems to be aware of the need for keeping a cool head in business and thinking things through,\" said Donald J. Robertson, author of \"How To Think Like Socrates.\" \"The Stoics understood the need to maintain their calm and manage high pressure situations.\"\n\nThe ability to replace his anger with rational detachment came in handy during a high-stakes business meeting. In 1990, a bank executive reneged on his promise to buy back a troubled loan that Rosenkranz's firm had taken on.\n\nRosenkranz refused the bank's request to modify the loan terms. That led to a meeting with the bank's chief executive, who threatened to harm Rosenkranz's reputation if he didn't consent to the bank's attempt at loan modification.\n\n\"I was being bullied by the bank and I was so pissed,\" he recalled.\n\nRather than react emotionally, Rosenkranz regrouped. \"I excused myself to the men's room,\" he said. \"I needed to physically remove myself\" from the meeting to calm down.\n\nReturning a few minutes later, he realized he needed to capitulate. So he gracefully thanked the CEO for explaining the situation.\n\n\"I managed to act gracious in defeat, and I must acknowledge that he was correspondingly gracious in victory,\" he wrote. \"I experienced him as a bully, but as Marcus Aurelius would have reminded me, 'Everything is just an impression.'\"\n\nUpholding his reputation proved valuable at other points in his career. Prior to the October 1987 stock market crash, he had agreed to pay $220 million to buy insurer Reliance Standard Life of which $20 million was equity.\n\n\"Every deal announced before the crash was abandoned or renegotiated after the crash,\" he said. \"I could've renegotiated a 5% or 10% reduction in purchase price.\"\n\nInstead, he decided to honor the original terms. \"I'd rather be known as someone who keeps my word in a negotiation,\" he said. \"That's more valuable in the long run than saving a few bucks.\"\n\nHe shifted from private equity deals to focus on the insurance business, taking the CEO role and renaming the company Delphi. In late 2011, Japanese conglomerate Tokio Marine acquired Delphi's equity for $2.7 billion.\n\nReflecting on his career, Rosenkranz credits his efforts to control his emotions as a key to his success. He lists three of the \"biggest negative emotions\" as anger, fear and jealousy. \"You have to contain them or it can lead to bad outcomes,\" he warned.\n\nWhen launching Rosenkranz & Co. in 1978 after his fateful meeting with Mailman, he knew exactly what kind of organizational culture he wanted to cultivate in leading his new firm.\n\nIn a previous job with Rand Corp., Rosenkranz admired how the California-based think tank operated.\n\n\"It was a model of open decision-making and reasoning,\" he said. \"We were dealing with nuclear war and these momentous issues. There was no room for bureaucracy, thoughtlessness or corporate politics.\"\n\nRosenkranz often began meetings at his private equity firm by reminding staffers of his ground rule: No idea would be criticized. \"I encouraged more junior people to speak up,\" he said.\n\nHe also refined his interview process to recruit top talent. When hiring investment managers, for instance, he liked to ask, \"What was the last stock you purchased for your own account?\"\n\nTheir response helped him assess to what extent they were thoughtful in investing their own money. This shed light on how they'd invest his firm's money.\n\u2022 Built private equity firm and then grew an insurance business before selling for $2.7 billion.\n\u2022 Overcame: Temptation to let fiery emotions overcome his pragmatic reasoning in key business negotiations.\n\u2022 Lesson: \"Stoics use reason to regulate emotions. We all react emotionally. We're not trying to deny that or suppress emotions, but it's your responsibility to decide whether acting on emotion will serve your interests or not.\"\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nBe Detailed And Targeted To Raise Money",

      "text": "There is a fine line between making yourself stressed and miserable pursuing perfection, and finding contentment while still achieving excellence. Knowing the difference can ward off burnout.\n\"Perfectionism is a way of thinking, feeling and acting based on idealized, flawlessly high standards,\" said psychologist Bob Rosen. \"Achieving excellence is the pursuit of high standards with flexibility and self-acceptance.\"\nRosen has advised over 600 CEOs as the founder of Healthy Companies, a leadership development firm.\n\"The secret to unlocking our potential and living our best life is to cut bait on unhealthy attachments,\" he said. \"These attachments could be to ideas, people, ideals and behaviors that prevent us from being our best selves and achieving excellence.\"\nDon't Wait For Burnout To Start Practicing Self-Care\nHigh achiever Tiffany Moon graduated from Cornell at 19, finished at the top of her medical school class by 23 and became an anesthesiologist. She is also a mother and founder of three companies.\nShe says she used to think self-care was something people did when they couldn't keep up. Moon now recognizes that self-care allows her to keep going in a sustainable way.\n\"Self-care isn't selfish. It's how we stay well enough to take care of the people and things we care about,\" she said.\nFor Moon, that means blocking out four hours every Sunday to do things she might not be able to during the week. These include taking a sauna and cold plunge, reviewing her calendar, meditating and reading.\n\"It lets me start my week sane,\" she said.\nRosen says to practice the main dimensions of well-being: your physical, emotional, intellectual, social, career and spiritual health.\nStop Comparing Yourself To Others\nComparison to another person is the \"thief of joy,\" Moon, the author of \"Joy Prescriptions,\" said. Sadly though, comparison \"is the default setting for so many of us,\" she added.\nComparison leads nowhere constructive. You either spend time and energy envying another person or feeling bad about yourself. Who wants to sign up for that?\nWhen you find yourself comparing, Moon suggests asking yourself this: \"What are things I could learn from this person?\"\n\"When we shift from comparing to connecting with someone, we create space for collaboration, deeper relationships and peace of mind,\" she said.\nLet Go Of The Word 'Should' To Avoid Burnout\nLegendary Hall of Fame basketball coach Phil Jackson would dismiss questions from reporters about missed opportunities in a game by saying \"Coulda, shoulda, woulda.\"\nMoon agrees: \"The word 'should' is a red flag. I 'should' work more. I 'should' be further along.\"\n\"The second I stopped living by 'shoulds' and started making choices based on what's actually aligned with my values, everything changed,\" she added.\nWatch How You Talk to Yourself To Achieve Excellence\nWould you talk to a friend the way you talk to yourself when you're down or disappointed in yourself? Probably not.\n\"I always joke that you'll never be meaner to me than I am to myself,\" Moon said. While it's true most high-achieving people have a relentless inner critic, \"Be kind to yourself and give yourself some grace,\" she said.\nPsychologist Rosen, the author of \"Detach: Ditch Your Baggage to Live a More Fulfilling Life,\" adds to \"Confront your inner critic and embrace your best work, not your perfect work.\"\nHe advises to speak and act with \"constructive impatience\" toward yourself.\nConfront Your Fears Of Failure And Burnout\nIdentify what is driving your need for perfectionism to unhealthy levels. Is it fear of not having enough money? Not being enough? Fears of inadequacy or insignificance?\nMany executives are of course driven to be successful. \"But when our desire for success turns into a compulsive need for achievement, we've got a real problem,\" Rosen said.\nHe says many people often define success from other people's expectations, and not their own.\nSo, ask yourself a simple but magical question: When it's all said and done, \"what do you truly need to be happy and fulfilled?\"\nFall In Love With Your Imperfections\nIn striving for excellence, business people often get tripped up by their attachment to the ideal and pursuit of perfection. The actual comforting truth is, \"We all are imperfect by nature,\" Rosen said.\nWe all have things we wish we just were naturally better at or could improve on. Most people have regrets they wish they could correct.\n\"By accepting our shortcomings, you can befriend your imperfections and loosen your attachment to perfection. You can rebalance your work and avoid the workaholism that perfection drives,\" Rosen said. \"Love yourself unconditionally and get comfortable with who you are and what you have.\"\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nMeet The Guy Who Runs A Massive $2.7 Trillion Bond Portfolio\nBe Detailed And Targeted To Raise Money\nInspirational Quotes: Columbus Short, Sam Rayburn And Others\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens"

      "text": "Ideally, go-getters set goals that are ambitious and then follow through. But obstacles almost always get in the way.\nPerhaps the biggest obstacle is one of our own making: We just don't care all that much about achieving the goal. It sounds good at first, but loses its luster quickly.\nMany factors can stymie our progress. Lacking the inner drive to pursue a challenging goal can prove especially hard to overcome.\n\"It's important to ask, 'How much value are my goals giving me?'\" said Leslie Perlow, a professor of leadership at Harvard Business School. \"Habit change must be in service of who you want to be and how to enact that. There must be some alignment there.\"\nSet Goals That Will Mean Something\nIf the goal you've set is meaningful to you, that's a good sign. But it doesn't have to be.\nSome goals promise joyfulness that may only last a short time. Others deliver deeper, longer-lasting meaning. The satisfaction of achievement also plays a role.\n\"In life, no matter what stage you're at, you need a minimum amount of all three (joy, meaning, achievement), all of the time,\" said Perlow, creator of the Life Matrix tool. Still, meaningful goals tend to wield considerable power. It's harder to give up if you're compelled to keep advancing even amid adversity.\nTo ensure your goals are meaningful, dig deep. How can you set goals and prioritize the ones that matter most?\nRethink What Meaning Means\nIt's easy to assume that meaningful goals are lofty and groundbreaking. But you can derive meaning from more modest aspirations.\n\"A meaningful goal need not have this grand mission,\" said Tamara Myles, co-author of \"Meaningful Work.\" Instead of being characterized by intensity or immensity, a goal can carry meaning simply by motivating you to sweep away a bad habit or score an incremental win.\nSet Happiness Aside To Set Goals\nBeware of equating meaningful goals with happy goals. The richest, most rewarding goals won't continually lift your spirits as you pursue them.\n\"Meaningful goals may not bring you pleasure in the moment,\" said Myles, a professor of leadership at Boston College. \"They can be really hard and make you feel uncomfortable. But in hindsight, they're meaningful.\"\nPut Procrastination To The Test\nIf you find yourself procrastinating after setting a goal, figure out why. Don't attribute it to laziness.\n\"If you find yourself procrastinating again and again, it can have more to do with avoiding negative emotions than being lazy,\" Myles said. \"Procrastination can be a red flag that your goal doesn't matter that much to you.\"\nSeparate Internal From External Drivers\nMeaningful goals often spring from an internal desire to accomplish something special. You're driven by an inner will to succeed, not external gratification.\nBeware of chasing carrots such as money, status or peer approval, Myles says. These motivations can fade or leave you unfulfilled even if you achieve the goal.\nRun An Experiment When You Set Goals\nUnsure whether your goal is sufficiently meaningful to you? Complete this sentence: \"If I attain this goal, it will help me (or my employer) to \u2026\" Then reflect on what's to gain by hitting your target \u2014 and ask yourself, \"Is that worth a lot to me?\"\n\"You want to see the ultimate impact of your work,\" Myles said. \"And if that impact has meaning.\"\nSet Goals And Enlist Allies\nA goal can become more meaningful when you involve others in your efforts. Teams who work together can feed off each other's energy.\n\"It's looking for ways to build relational meaning,\" Myles said. \"That can be by bringing in a mentor or partnering with someone\" who works with you to facilitate goal attainment.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nMeet The Guy Who Runs A Massive $2.7 Trillion Bond Portfolio\nBe Detailed And Targeted To Raise Money\nInspirational Quotes: Columbus Short, Sam Rayburn And Others\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens"

      "text": "Investment capital jump-starts a business. To unlock the flow of funds, the golden rule of raising money is structuring and presenting your proposal to win over investors.\nThat's what Jonathan Martin, president of WEKA, a software development company, has learned. WEKA has raised $135 million in investment capital with his help.\nHow do you do this? Strategically deliver your company's most attractive investing points, he said. Nail down the fundamental details that are most important to your investor audience. Don't make investors work to figure out why they should invest in your idea.\nPulling this off will gain investors' confidence and give you the best opportunity to earn their investment capital.\nTreat Time As Money When Raising Investment Capital\nBe brief. Investors are slammed with other pitches. \"Assume you have 10 to 15 minutes to get them excited,\" said Sean Behr, CEO at Fountain, an online recruiting tool. Behr also has built four successful companies, raised hundreds of millions of dollar and invested in over 30 companies as an angel investor.\n\"Most times investors are either interested or out after five or 10 slides,\" he said.\nIn addition, keep it simple. \"If you only have a short window to get an investor excited about your company, don't have them trying to figure out your business,\" Behr said. \"Any minute where they are confused is a lost minute.\"\nBe able to say what your company does in a sentence, said Matt Gibson, CEO and co-founder of New Culture. \"When speaking about New Culture, I say, 'We make cow cheese without the cow.' \"\n\"If an investor doesn't understand what your company does in the first 30 seconds, they will be disengaged for the entire pitch,\" he said.\nInvestment Capital: Remember It Is All About Bucks\nBe clear and focused on how your startup makes or will make money, says Pat Dillon, chief financial officer of Flock Freight, a freight logistics technology company.\n\"Listing 10 different monetization methods can convey that you can't actually make any of them work,\" he said.\nMartin said the best thing you can do is show results, growth or traction. \"Customers are your first investors \u2014 (venture capitalists) will want to know if they believe in your product and are willing to reinvest in it. This shows that you can execute and it's more than just ideas.\"\nDrill Home Why You're Different To Gain Investment Capital\n\"It is critical to explain why you are different from the myriad of other startups in your space,\" Dillon said.\nTechnology lures competition over time, he adds. \"You must be able to articulate your competitive advantage. Why will it expand your lead over time, versus losing to competition?\"\nPitch Directly To Your Funding Stage\nWhat investors evaluate and care about most varies significantly at every investment stage, Martin says.\nIn Series A, investors want to know the value proposition and market potential of your product or idea. In Series B, you must prove your early product viability and show how it will attract customers.\nSeries C investors want to know your go-to-market strategy. And in Series D it's about whether your financials are strong and if you can grow while keeping costs down.\nHelp Make The Investment Committee Memo Easy To Write\nYou may have built rapport with one or more investment professionals at a particular fund, but politics only gets you so far, Dillon says. \"There aren't any shortcuts around a full investment committee's process,\" he said.\nUse your personal connections with investors to help them prepare for their investment committee, he says. \"Find out what they plan to include in their memo. Provide relevant, objective information they can use,\" Dillon said.\nEvery investor is going to do their due diligence to validate their investment thesis, Dillon says. \"But that should not preclude you from including your perspective. Doing this the right way builds trust with investors.\"\nBe Bold To Earn Investment Capital\nAsk very blunt questions to get to a yes or no answer, Gibson said.\n\"It is OK, and encouraged, to ask an investor 'What else do you need from me to write a check?' \" he said. \"Investors can drag things out and wait for other investors to make the first move. Don't let them. A quick no is far better than months of no firm answer.\"\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nHenry Kissinger Turns 100 And Imparts Lessons Of An Eventful Life\nAdmit Your Mistakes Without Going Overboard\nInspirational Quotes: Jessica Savitch, Christine Gutierrez And Others\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\nMarketSmith: Research, Charts, Data And Coaching All In One Place"

      "text": "Fear often keeps people from taking the all-important first step towards success. It is that little voice in our heads that often holds us back. Fear gives us pause. It puts a negative spin on things. How do you overcome fear?\nLetting negativity from naysayers deflate you can also be a career killer.\n\"It's that self-doubt that creeps up in all of us, that despite who we are, what we have accomplished and what our plans are, that we are not good enough,\" said Dr. Bernard Harris Jr., the first African-American astronaut to walk in space and author of \"Embracing Infinite Possibilities: Letting Go of Fear to Find Your Highest Potential.\"\n\"Those fears hold us back,\" he said.\nThe good news? You can learn to overcome fear and reinvent yourself throughout your life, says Harris. He went to medical school and started his career as a doctor in the early '80s before joining NASA in 1988 and becoming an astronaut in 1991. Self-empowerment and self-determination can go a long way, says Harris.\nIn the 30 years since Harris took that historic walk in space, he has reinvented himself many times. After retiring from space exploration, he pivoted to the world of business, entrepreneurship and venture capital.\nHarris shares his strategies for moving beyond fear and self-doubt when facing career transitions. His template for success is all about the self-knowledge and self-acceptance that empower people to take charge of their own success.\nRealize Your Own Capabilities\nEveryone needs a foundation to build upon. Part of that is identifying what excites you.\n\"Get to know who you are,\" said Harris. What motivates you? What drives you? Then figure out what you're good at. Don't downplay your accomplishments, whether it's going to medical school, acing career tests, walking in space or landing a job you thought was a long shot.\n\"Having that foundation allows you to be prepared for the fears that you will face,\" said Harris. \"When the self-doubt inevitably comes, you have to back up and say, 'No, no, no, I am good enough, and I don't have to doubt myself.'\"\nTaking big steps in life is all about preparation. Harris recalls his case of nerves when he stepped out into space for the first time 30 years ago.\n\"When you open that hatch and step out that door and walk out into space for the first time, you step into fear,\" Harris said. \"Then you realize that, hey, I have all the tools necessary to overcome this. Knowing what you're capable of allows you to take that leap of faith.\"\nLet Things Go To Overcome Fear\nDon't dwell on setbacks for too long. And don't let today's failure impact tomorrow. In short, don't allow what Harris dubs \"15 minutes of shame\" to consume you \u2014 or define you or stop you from moving forward.\nHarris offers the following fix: \"Say to yourself, 'OK, I'll allow myself 15 minutes to beat myself up and say, 'I should have done this, I should have done that.' After that, I'm going to move on,\" Harris said.\nIn essence, learn from failure, don't fear it.\nVisualize Success And Overcome Fear\nYou can't achieve a goal or success unless you imagine it in your mind. And play the dream over in your head repeatedly. Just as a superstar basketball player visualizes hitting a three-point shot at the buzzer, you must visualize success, too.\n\"You have to see yourself doing it,\" said Harris. \"When I talk to kids in primary school, I say, 'When I was your age, I used to visualize getting into my very own spaceship and traveling to the moon and then exploring the moon.' I know it sounds stupid, but it is the reason I'm here today (as the first African American to walk in space) because I visualized myself doing that.\"\nBelieve In Yourself When Others Don't\nYour mindset and self-belief are keys to success. \"When you go through life, you're going to have more naysayers than believers,\" said Harris. \"Being mindful of the negative influences that may derail your progress is so important.\"\nWhat people say about you or stereotypes can become impediments to success. Believing in yourself allows you to be resilient, says Harris. It's also important to surround yourself with people who believe in you.\n\"Seek out those role models, those folks who inspire you,\" said Harris. \"My quest to accomplish things and move forward were in part due to people's negative expectations of me (throughout my life),\" said Harris. \"You can't do this. You can't do that.\"\nRaise Your Expectation And Overcome Fear\nDon't limit yourself. Shoot higher. The last thing you want is to underachieve. Once you make an accurate assessment of what your talents, capabilities and skill set are, raise your expectations to a level commensurate with your abilities.\nIt's better to set high expectations than to undershoot to the downside. \"Don't sell yourself short,\" said Harris. \"Don't allow yourself to squander the talents and skills that you have.\"\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nMeet The Guy Who Runs A Massive $2.7 Trillion Bond Portfolio\nBe Detailed And Targeted To Raise Money\nInspirational Quotes: Columbus Short, Sam Rayburn And Others\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens"

      "text": "Nobody likes a know-it-all. But if you're the smartest person in the room, how can you win over others?\nThe challenge is not shoving your intelligence in everyone's face. If you adopt an air of superiority, they'll reject you.\n\"A degree of humility is best,\" said Michael Chad Hoeppner, author of \"Don't Say Um.\" \"There are different types of intelligence. The smartest people, when they leave the room, they make everyone in the room feel smarter.\"\nDon't Be A Show-Off If You're The Smartest Person\nSelf-awareness determines whether you harness your smarts to everyone's benefit \u2014 or show off. Rather than seek external validation, build trust and rapport that breeds teamwork\nBetter yet, stoke others' curiosity. By posing wise questions and listening patiently, you keep learning.\n\"If you're really smart, you want people to come to you for expertise and guidance,\" not impose yourself on them, said Maryanne O'Brien, author of \"The Elevated Communicator.\" \"You want to bring out the best in others by cultivating their curiosity.\"\nTo turn your vast knowledge into an asset \u2014 not a liability \u2014 radiate low-key confidence. How can you possess outsize smarts without having it work against you?\nFix Inaccuracies At The Right Time\nIf you hear something that's factually wrong, pause before you jump in. Ask yourself, \"Must I speak up now, or can this wait?\"\n\"Don't be quick to correct them,\" said O'Brien, a Minneapolis-based communication consultant. \"No one likes to be corrected, especially in front of others.\"\nAdjust Your Voice As The Smartest Person\nIf you're exceptionally smart, you may try to translate complexities into plain English. But that risks oversimplifying your message.\n\"Don't feel you need to dumb down your ideas,\" said Hoeppner, founder of GK Training, a communication skills training firm. \"Instead, change your delivery. Slow your speech a little bit to give others more time to process\" your remarks.\nDon't talk too fast or you might overwhelm listeners. They may shut down and ignore you.\nRun Experiments\nKnow-it-alls can fall into a predicable vocal rhythm. They give lectures or reel off facts without coming up for air. Rather than lapse into a rat-a-tat speaking style, vary your tone. Example: Rather than list point after point, tell a story or pose a riddle to captivate others.\n\"Share your ideas with variety,\" Hoeppner said. \"It forces you to be more disciplined. And because different people like to listen to different stuff, you'll appeal to a wider audience.\"\nDraw Succinct Conclusions\nIf you're erudite, you can rattle off so much information that you leave everyone wondering, \"What's the point?\"\nInstead, apply this two-sentence strategy: Start with a one-sentence rundown of facts, statistics or observations. Then draw a concise conclusion that flows from what you just said.\n\"You maximize your intellect by saying something really smart followed by something incredibly basic, using monosyllabic words (if possible),\" Hoeppner said. \"Smash the two together and you'll make others feel smart\" as they reach the same conclusion.\nSmartest Person: Forge A Bond\nJust because you're smarter than others doesn't mean you can't bond with them on a human level.\n\"Talk about what you have in common,\" said Catherine Sanderson, a professor of psychology at Amherst College. \"Losing a parent, being divorced or fired, having a miscarriage. Look for ways to humanize yourself\" by showing empathy and you'll connect with a diverse mix of people.\nAdmit Your Gaps\nAcknowledge what you don't know and seek help from those who excel in skills you lack. That endears you to others.\n\"Say, 'I'm not up to speed on this,'\" said Sanderson, author of \"Why We Act.\" \"By doing that, you let others (contribute). It models that we all have strengths.\"\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nMeet The Guy Who Runs A Massive $2.7 Trillion Bond Portfolio\nBe Detailed And Targeted To Raise Money\nInspirational Quotes: Columbus Short, Sam Rayburn And Others\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens"

      "text": "Leadership has evolved from the stereotypical demanding boss treating people like emotionless machines. Effective leadership now taps into the psychology of wellness at work to help employees succeed in a healthy way.\nAnd workers want to succeed: According to consulting firm McKinsey, 70% of employees say their sense of purpose comes from work.\n\"Meaning and fulfillment are deeply intertwined with our work but right now that is missing,\" said Jennifer Moss, a workplace culture expert. Disappointedly, she cites research that says around a third of employees are dissatisfied at work.\n\"This is a huge opportunity for effective leaders to step up and close the purpose gap because it can make a real difference in people's lives,\" she said.\nHope Is A Wellness At Work Strategy For Effective Leaders\nMoss shares recent Gallup research that shows employees said providing hope is the top leadership quality they are looking for in a boss.\nWhen people believe they can influence their future, they are more engaged and productive.\n\"Leaders who operationalize hope through clear goals, multiple pathways to success and a sense of agency help employees break out of survival mode,\" she said. \"Then, employees see a future for themselves in the organization.\"\nReduce Employee Mental Overload\nThe workplace has become overwhelming, Moss said. Often there are just too many meetings, too many tools to master and too much information to process efficiently.\nFurther, brain science shows that excessive decision-making and interruptions drain working memory and increase stress, she reports.\n\"Leaders must actively simplify workflows,\" Moss said. \"Leaders need to reduce redundant meetings and protect deep work time. This creates a culture that maximizes performance rather than exhaustion.\"\nRecognize People Beyond Metrics For Wellness At Work\nIn business, traditional reward systems focus on outcomes. That makes sense. But leaders can drive the outcomes and performances they want by putting some additional thought into goals.\n\"Psychological research shows that people thrive when recognized for effort, creativity and character, not just results,\" said Moss, author of \"Why Are We Here? Creating A Work Culture Everyone Wants.\"\nAnd when the recognition is spontaneous and specific, \"studies on motivation show it has an even stronger impact,\" Moss said.\nUltimately, recognizing employees for achievements beyond just bottom-line results can lead to even better performance for all employees. Broadening rewards encourages wellness at work.\nDon't Try To Be A Superhero Leader\n\"We're often taught that leaders should be stoic, decisive and flawless,\" said Patricia Grabarek, an organizational psychologist and a cofounder of Workr Beeing, a firm that helps improve wellness at work.\nIn reality, \"employees want leaders who are genuine,\" said Katina Sawyer, Workr Beeing's other cofounder. \"Employees want real people with hopes, dreams and struggles.\"\nWhen leaders embrace vulnerability and show their reality, \"they build trust and inspire others to see leadership as something they, too, can achieve,\" Sawyer said.\nLeaders Who Prioritize Life Over Work Win\nMost leaders acknowledge that employees need a life outside of work. Yet, when it really matters, they often expect employees to sacrifice personal commitments for their job.\n\"Effective leaders understand that this mindset leads to burnout,\" Grabarek, co-author with Sawyer of \"Leading for Wellness,\" said. \"Burnout costs companies (money), and good leadership can fix it.\"\nThat type of leadership includes actively creating space for employees to honor their life commitments.\nFor example, say an employee coaches their child's sports team and needs to leave at 4:30 p.m. twice a week. An effective leader won't schedule a recurring 4 p.m. meeting which conflicts with that priority.\n\"Instead, they work collaboratively to structure work in a way that supports \u2014 not competes with \u2014 employees' personal goals,\" Grabarek said.\nJust as importantly, effective bosses lead by example. \"If they don't set boundaries and prioritize their own lives, employees won't believe it's truly acceptable to disconnect,\" she said. \"By modeling healthy work-life balance, effective leaders build trust and create a culture where both work and life can thrive.\"\nWellness At Work Isn't One-Size-Fits-All\nGeneric wellness at work programs are not the best solution for stopping burnout and disengagement. That's because they reflect \"blanket solutions or a one-size-fits-all approach to address what are often personalized and unique wellness challenges,\" Grabarek said.\nEffective leaders know their employees are not twins of each other. Solutions for supporting their well-being are unlikely to be the same.\n\"Effective leaders get to know their team members and create comfortable environments for them to share their wellness struggles,\" Sawyer said. \"Then they work to tailor wellness approaches to each employee.\"\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nMeet The Guy Who Runs A Massive $2.7 Trillion Bond Portfolio\nBe Detailed And Targeted To Raise Money\nInspirational Quotes: Columbus Short, Sam Rayburn And Others\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens"

      "text": "It's a busy Monday \u2014 two days before the Federal Reserve's closely watched June 14 interest rate decision. But bond guru Rick Rieder is already three days into his workweek. \"My day started on Saturday,\" said Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.\nRieder manages $2.7 trillion in fixed-income assets. That vast sum of money is more than the GDP of many of the world's developed economies, including Italy, Canada, South Korea, Australia and Spain. And managing that much of other people's money means Rieder has a lot more at stake than virtually every investor on the planet.\nFund-tracker Morningstar named Rieder the winner of its 2023 Outstanding Portfolio Manager award. The accolade recognizes fund managers not only for outstanding long-term returns but also for developing and sticking to sound investment processes that endure over time.\n\"Rieder devours research and distills it into a diversified collection of small bets rather than a few larger ones,\" Morningstar said. \"He then monitors risk like a border collie patrolling for strays and wolves. Rieder is known for his insatiable appetite for data and command of the minute details of everything.\"\nStick To A Plan Like Rick Rieder\nFed Day is a big day on Wall Street, as interest rate decisions by the nation's central bank move markets. But winging it isn't Rieder's style.\nHe prefers to trade only after he's done his homework. Before instructing his traders on what to buy and sell, he likes to have a good sense of how Fed news or a fresh data point will impact markets. And when it comes to market risk, Rieder likes to stack the odds in his favor.\nJust like a real estate investor knows it's all about location, Rieder knows winning on Wall Street is all about preparation. That's why he sets his alarm for 3:45 a.m. seven days a week. He's seeking clues to the market's next move while most people are sleeping.\nListen To Market Data\nData, Rieder says, is his guiding light. Downtime for him is poring through 1,000 market charts and tables on a Saturday morning. Fun is reading big-picture market research published by Wall Street's smart-money crowd.\nHis goal: get a cohesive view of where the world is going and not get caught up in the story of the day.\n\"I just keep reading and reading and reading,\" said Rieder. \"It gives you the confidence to make decisions and that you're making the right call.\"\nRieder: Tie Together Your Passions\nThe investment bug bit Rieder when he was a kid. He was an avid sports fan. Wins. Losses. Statistics. Scores. Standings. Numbers grabbed his attention. \"I like the dynamic nature of it,\" he said. \"I found investing just like following sports.\" He got his first stock idea watching a ball roll down a bowling alley: bowling ball maker AMF. \"I probably bought $50 worth of AMF stock,\" with money earned from a summer job, Rieder said.\nThen at a job interview in college, he learned about the Tylenol tampering scandal. The interviewer mentioned another company that made tamper-free prescription bottle caps. \"I found it incredibly interesting,\" Rieder said.\nIn the end, though, after earning an MBA from The Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, Rieder ultimately ended up trading bonds. His first job as a financial analyst at brokerage E.F. Hutton in 1987 was short-circuited by the Black Monday stock market crash. \"I thought my career was over,\" Rieder said. But he quickly landed a new gig at Lehman Brothers where he got his start trading corporate bonds.\nWork Harder Than Everyone Else\nYou don't end up managing $2.7 trillion by slacking off or thinking you're better than the person sitting at the desk next to you. Hard work plus preparation equals success, Rieder says.\n\"I've got to work harder,\" said Rieder. \"To this day, I don't think I'm necessarily better than anybody else. I just prepare really hard.\"\nTrading skills aren't necessarily instinctual, says Rieder. So, the strategy of buying and selling bonds must be improved like a baseball pitcher's curveball. Every day is a new day to figure things out in a fast-changing world.\nPut Fear To Work For You Like Rick Rieder\nAnd don't underestimate how fear of failure can act as a powerful motivational tool, says Rieder. \"Throughout my career, I've always thought I can get fired tomorrow,\" Rieder said. \"So, I just think you have to keep working on it.\"\nOne of his role models for work ethic is retired Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr., who played 2,632 games in a row. \"His jersey is hanging in my office,\" said Rieder. \"He showed up for work every day. I have a huge amount of respect for people like that.\"\nKnow Tough Times Can Propel Your Career\nLearning from trades gone bad or other work setbacks is part of the process. \"In school, if you study really hard you should be able to get a 95 grade,\" said Rieder. \"But all of a sudden you realize that in markets, you're not always going to get a 95.\"\nRieder learned the hard way earlier in his career. Research on a particular bond gave him conviction to buy a lot of them. He bought too many. \"I started losing a bunch of money,\" Rieder said. \"I didn't ever want to go through that again.\"\nAll the red ink turned out to be a positive. It taught Rieder not to bet too big a chunk of capital on any single investment or put oneself in a bad trading position. Instead, the secret to success in trading is consistency, as small trading wins over and over add up to big profits.\n\"What you want to do is use research and analytics to tilt the odds in your favor,\" said Rieder. \"It doesn't mean we'll be the best performer in one month or one year. But if you keep doing that over three years, five years, 10 years, your results will be really good.\"\nPut On A Trade Before Release Of Key Data Points\nRieder earns his living making returns in excess of an asset's benchmark.\nTo generate returns, he says, he needs to take risk heading into an event. He puts on trades before the Fed decides to hike or cut rates, or before the government releases key data such as the monthly payroll report or the latest read on inflation.\n\"Today, more than ever, the markets move instantly (in reaction to new information),\" said Rieder. \"So, all of the return potential is gone the second (news breaks).\"\nTo make prudent trades with good reward-vs.-risk potential, Rieder does his homework. He assesses what a Fed statement might say or a new data point might mean. And then he calculates how his funds' current positioning may be impacted based on different scenarios.\nRieder: Don't Focus On Surveys\nIn Rieder's line of work, separating real news from the noise is critical to success. One way he does that is to focus on facts, such as an economic data release. He pays less attention to surveys, such as University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index or the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), that are forward-looking but based on people's opinion of what they think about the future.\n\"Markets are all about turns in the data,\" said Rieder. \"I'd much rather read earnings reports.\"\nHe also says it makes most sense to glean key insights from people in the know, such as game-changing CEOs like Elon Musk of Tesla (TSLA), Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com (AMZN), and Tim Cook of Apple (AAPL). \"I get a sense for how and where things are going from people that I think are visionaries,\" said Rieder.\nAnd he says books like Malcolm Gladwell's, \"The Tipping Point\" and \"The Second Machine Age\" by Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson give him a framework about how a business idea catches on and spreads like wildfire and the revolutionary impact of technology on business. \"That's incredibly insightful and helpful to me,\" said Rieder.\nControl Your Stress\nIn today's 24/7 market that never sleeps, stress can build up. Rieder says to stay on your A-game, it's vital to decompress. You must clear your head and get away mentally for a short spell.\nRieder says reading helps him escape. So does a round of golf on Saturday and Sunday and spending time with family.\n\"It gives you a much-needed break from the constant tension,\" Rieder said. \"It clears my mind.\"\nSo does working out at 4:30 a.m. every morning. He exercises at least six days a week, mixing in weightlifting sessions with aerobic workouts. And he takes a walk in the middle of the day when markets are beating up on him. Another escape is listening to classic rock or country music. \"It's incredibly liberating,\" said Rieder. \"I need my time to myself.\"\nBut Remember Not All Stress Is Bad\nRieder also stresses that some stress is good, though. Just like an athlete has butterflies before a big game, traders and other professionals also can benefit from pressure.\n\"You have to have that pit in your stomach,\" said Rieder. \"I found that if you feel like there's no risk in your portfolio, or your portfolio looks just like an index, you really can't generate any return.\"\nRieder says he's learned to deal with the stress of the job. \"I thrive on it, really,\" said Rieder. \"On Sunday night when the markets open in Asia, I find it incredibly exciting.\"\nThere's no one road to success, says Rieder. But there is a secret to success.\nBlackRock's Rieder's Keys\n- Manages the $2.7 trillion bond portfolio at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.\n- Overcame: Short-circuiting of early stock analysis job due to 1987 Black Monday stock market crash.\n- Lesson: \"You have to find something that motivates you.

It's not \"fake it until you make it,\" but rather to \"align your mindset with your goals,\" Pilarczyk said. \"Your mindset is your operating system,\" he said. \"If it's running outdated software \u2014 inherited limiting beliefs an old fears \u2014 it doesn't matter how powerful your hardware is.\"\nBut if your mindset isn't ideal, how do you improve it? \"You won't perform at your best. In business, we update our tools constantly. But how often do we update ourselves?\" he said.\nUnderstand What You Truly Want To Develop Your Mindset\nPeople spend a lot of their time developing a business strategy \u2014 but rarely take time to create a strategy for their life, Pilarczyk says.\nClarity is a powerful mindset key, he says. A problem is that many people chase goals they never fully examined. Maybe those goals were instilled in them by someone else, and with no clear endgame or understanding of what the recipient really wanted.\nA meaningful life is deeply personal. \"It's different for everyone and it often evolves as you grow older or enter new phases of life,\" Pilarczyk said. He recommends asking yourself \"What do I really want to achieve\" presently? And make that very specific.\nClarity creates power. \"It's a mental booster that accelerates your ability to achieve what you truly want,\" he said.\nSeek The Sounds Of Silence To Develop Your Mindset\nDaily moments of silence create clarity. And noise \u2014 figurative and literally \u2014 kills it, Pilarczyk said. By muffling noise you'll make better decisions, he says. \"Silence is the best filter,\" he said. \"It helps you hear your intuition.\"\nHe recommends making time to be alone with your own thoughts, a \"mental detox.\" Your quiet time should include stepping away from social media and putting down your phone.\n\"Sit quietly each morning and ask: What kind of life do I want to build?\" he said. \"'What truly matters to me? What is the most important task today? ' Make it clear and concrete.\"\nAfter 35 years as an entrepreneur, Pilarczyk says \"my daily moments of silence are my most powerful tools. That's when my best creative business ideas and visions appear.\"\nSee The Power Of Visualization To Develop Your Mindset\nHave you ever imagined things like \"How does a great golf swing feel? What does a fantastic tennis shot look like? What is the best way to ski the run that gets you to the bottom quickly and safely?\"\nThese processes are not only great motivators, \"they are also a road map to success that we visualize before embarking on the actual activity,\" said Tom Preston. He's the founder of The Preston Associates, an executive coaching firm.\nUnfortunately, we do not often apply the same process to our work lives, he adds. \"The impact of visualizing a great presentation, a successful meeting or the creation of a successful project management plan is just as powerful in a work context.\"\nIn addition, visualization helps build the confidence needed to succeed, which is essential when things look daunting, he adds.\nUtilize Your Human Superpower\nAI can do a lot of things, but it can't replace a winning, can-do human attitude. Preston, who with Luciana Nunez wrote \"Coaching Power,\" calls attitude \"the surprising performance equation.\"\nLegendary football coach Bill Walsh said great talent plus a bad attitude equals bad talent. Similarly, Preston says performance is the product of capability and attitude.\n\"As AI advances, knowledge increasingly becomes a commodity,\" Preston said. \"So, the biggest performance driver is actually the way people show up, their behaviors and their mindset. Or, put simply, their attitude.\"\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nMeet The Guy Who Runs A Massive $2.7 Trillion Bond Portfolio\nBe Detailed And Targeted To Raise Money\nInspirational Quotes: Columbus Short, Sam Rayburn And Others\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens"

      "text": "It's vital to make honesty and integrity key parts of your group's foundation of long-term success. That's how John Barrett has done it for more than three decades at the Fortune 500 company he runs.\nBarrett, chairman and chief executive of Cincinnati-based life insurance, investment advisory and real estate firm Western & Southern Financial Group, points to culture first when he talks about his company's success. That's the main reason Western & Southern, which owns or manages $125 billion in assets, has grown exponentially since he took over as CEO in 1994. It had $8.8 billion in assets then.\nHe sees integrity as being a key to long-term success. \"If people don't trust you, the heck with it,\" he said. \"You're not going to make good deals or have good relationships. If people know that you mean what you say and you say what you mean, you're going to be in much better shape.\"\nBuilding Long-Term Success Takes Time\nWhen Western & Southern developed Great American Tower at Queen City Square, which opened in January 2011 and is Cincinnati's largest office building, it was the result of a handshake deal with Carl Lindner III and Craig Lindner. They're co-CEOs of American Financial Group (AFG), which has been the building's largest tenant from Day One. They had known each other for years and developed trust.\nWestern & Southern was negotiating to buy Gerber Life Insurance Co. in 2018. Another company bid more, Barrett says, but Gerber parent Nestle picked Western & Southern. The deal included the 50-year use of the name, and Nestle wanted that brand equity protected. \"They knew us and they knew we would respect and nurture it,\" Barrett said.\nOperate With Honesty And Integrity Through Self-Awareness\nHonesty is vital to build trust, says Tim Irwin, an Atlanta-based industrial psychologist, leadership consultant and the author of \"Extraordinary Influence: How Great Leaders Bring Out the Best in Others.\"\n\"Trust is what allows the world to work,\" Irwin said. \"We have to trust institutions and other people. And honesty is the main contributor to trust.\"\nIrwin once surveyed hundreds of managers, asking for the most important trait they seek in their employees. Conscientiousness was the top answer. \"That's doing what you say you're going to do,\" Irwin said. \"If you say you'll have something done by Friday, it's done by Friday. If trust fails, everything else fails.\"\nStart by being honest with yourself. Self-awareness keeps you on track to honesty and integrity, Irwin says. \"You have to tell yourself the truth to tell others the truth,\" he said.\nGolf superstar Tiger Woods learned this lesson the hard way. In 2009, he admitted to infidelity in his marriage. \"He said, 'I told myself the normal rules didn't apply and that I was entitled,'\" Irwin said. \"When we lie to ourselves, it makes it much easier to lie to others.\"\nMake The Hard Choices\nBarrett builds trust through consistent behavior. \"You have to have a track record of doing the right thing,\" Barrett said.\nThe company hires people based on integrity, too. \"After you shake someone's hand, if you have to count your fingers, you don't want that person,\" he said.\nAvoid the temptation to tell a lie to get a big sale by sticking to your principles. \"It'll only bridge a short gap,\" Barrett said. \"Then you have to make up that and more next time. Face the music now or you'll face calamity later.\"\nMake it a tenet of your group to act with integrity and take the honest path rather than mislead people. \"It's a common phrase to choose the harder right rather than the easier wrong,\" Irwin said. \"When the leader builds that into the culture, it makes a huge difference.\"\nPlenty of cases arise where you can get short-term gains by ignoring your values. Those choices shouldn't be difficult. \"If your ethical guidelines are clear, normally you don't have to think too much about it,\" Irwin said. \"The situation might have ambiguity, but your principles don't.\"\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nMeet The Guy Who Runs A Massive $2.7 Trillion Bond Portfolio\nBe Detailed And Targeted To Raise Money\nInspirational Quotes: Columbus Short, Sam Rayburn And Others\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens"

      "text": "When you encounter inevitable obstacles as you're striving for success in business, don't panic. Instead, realize problems come with the territory and find a way to be resilient and rise above them.\nLori Rosenkopf, professor and vice dean of entrepreneurship at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has seen people who are starting businesses continuously battle adversity.\nResilience is \"absolutely central\" to entrepreneurial success, says Rosenkopf, who wrote \"Unstoppable Entrepreneurs.\"\n\"It's rarely the most brilliant idea or even the best-funded venture that wins,\" she said. \"It's the one that persists.\"\nHow To Be Unstoppable\nEach entrepreneur she profiled in \"Unstoppable Entrepreneurs\" faced adversity in situations where the easy choice would have been to walk away.\n\"But they didn't,\" she said. \"They navigated failure, doubt, pivots and no shortage of skeptics, and they kept going.\" Resilience, Rosenkopf says, is key to lasting success.\n\"It's the capacity to take hits, recalibrate and keep showing up,\" Rosenkopf said. \"That mindset turns hard lessons into future advantage.\"\nBe Resilient By Knowing Adversity Is Coming\nResilience is vital in all walks of life, says Doug Holladay, professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business and Washington, D.C.-based founder of PathNorth, which helps leaders broaden their definition of success.\n\"It's the central organizing principle of life,\" said Holladay, who previously held senior positions at the White House, state department and Goldman Sachs (GS).\nGet past that by accepting mistakes will be made. Create resilience by knowing adversity is inevitable.\n\"If you understand trouble is a reality instead of pretending it doesn't exist, you just embrace it as part of the deal,\" Holladay said.\nBoost Awareness Of Yourself\nSelf-awareness helps people build resiliency.\n\"They acknowledge their fears, they make space for vulnerability and they surround themselves with people who challenge and support them,\" Rosenkopf said.\nIn her book, Rosenkopf profiles Jesse Pujji, who started digital marketing firm Ampush with two partners. The company's first ad campaign fell flat. Money was running out. But he and his cofounders dug into the data, studied how competitors were succeeding and made changes. The firm eventually managed $1 billion in digital media spending and sold for mid-eight-figures.\n\"That kind of persistence under pressure is what resilience looks like in practice,\" Rosenkopf said.\nOwn Up To Mistakes\nAdmitting mistakes is the key to learning from them.\n\"The people I respect the most are the ones who say, 'I screwed up,'\" Holladay said. \"Truth and authenticity make you resilient.\"\nLeaders at any level can build that type of culture. Middle-managers can gather their team weekly and ask them to share what they're proud of and what they messed up.\n\"That will make that group more transparent and able to support each other,\" he said.\nBe Resilent By Rewarding Determination\nGet others to be resilient by telling stories that celebrate resilience. \"The stories we tell are the culture we shape,\" he said.\nHolladay says he advised former Cognizant (CTSH) Chief Executive Frank D'Souza, \"The most important thing you can do is be the chief storyteller. Tell the stories you think show the culture. Then people feel safe to experiment and try things.\"\nThey can't only be about success. People are more inspired by people overcoming obstacles than taking a smooth path to success, Rosenkopf says.\nSpread resilience across your group by communicating your key values. Katlyn Grasso, founder of women's empowerment network GenHERation, built a company that has helped more than 700,000 young women. But when Covid struck in 2020 it disrupted her in-person events. Grasso shifted to online events but also focused on the reason for her work and the relationships within her group,\n\"As a result, her team didn't freeze in the face of uncertainty \u2013 they moved forward with clarity and purpose,\" Rosenkopf said. \"That's what resilient leadership looks like.\"\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\nMeet The Guy Who Runs A Massive $2.7 Trillion Bond Portfolio\nBe Detailed And Targeted To Raise Money\nInspirational Quotes: Columbus Short, Sam Rayburn And Others\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens"
