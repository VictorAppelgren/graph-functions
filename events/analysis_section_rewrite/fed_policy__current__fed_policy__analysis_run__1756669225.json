      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Causal Chain & Asset Mapping**  \n   - **Issue:** The draft jumps from Fed independence to tariff policy to tech‑stock sell‑offs without explicitly linking each to the UST10Y.  \n   - **Action:** Add inline causal links: e.g., “Fed independence risk → higher inflation expectations → increased term premium → UST10Y rise (GXYXMKIG5)”; “Tariff hikes → supply‑side inflation → term premium → UST10Y (3952FOSRQ)”; “Tech‑stock sell‑offs → risk‑off sentiment → demand for safe assets → UST10Y (3YAQ8JUPL).”\n\n2. **Evidence & Quantification**  \n   - **Issue:** Claims such as “UST10Y sits at 4.23%” and “inflation above 2%” are stated without source IDs.  \n   - **Action:** Cite the exact source IDs: e.g., “UST10Y 4.23% (3YAQ8JUPL)”; “core PCE 2.9% y/y (3YAQ8JUPL).”\n\n3. **Horizon & Catalyst Window**  \n   - **Issue:** The 0–3 week horizon is implied but not anchored to a specific catalyst (e.g., upcoming core PCE release on 2025‑09‑07).  \n   - **Action:** Explicitly state the catalyst window: “Next core PCE release on 2025‑09‑07 (3YAQ8JUPL) will be the primary catalyst for any UST10Y move.”\n\n4. **Magnitude & Direction**  \n   - **Issue:** The draft gives a 10–20 bp range but lacks a clear direction (upward).  \n   - **Action:** Rephrase: “Expect UST10Y to rise 10–20 bp over the next 0–3 weeks if inflation data remain sticky and tariff policy unchanged.”\n\n5. **Invalidation & Monitoring**  \n   - **Issue:** Invalidation scenarios are vague.  \n   - **Action:** Add: “A surprise Fed rate cut (Waller’s 25 bp cut) or a tariff rollback would likely dampen the term premium, compressing UST10Y by 5–10 bp (GXYXMKIG5, 3952FOSRQ).”\n\n6. **Avoid Redundancy & Maintain Focus**  \n   - **Issue:** The Spirit Airlines bankruptcy is peripheral.  \n   - **Action:** Remove or condense to a single sentence: “Spirit’s bankruptcy signals broader credit stress but has limited direct impact on the UST10Y curve.”\n\n7. **Formatting & Conciseness**  \n   - **Issue:** Paragraphs are long and dense.  \n   - **Action:** Break into bullet points or short sentences, each ending with a citation ID, to meet the “elite bar” of concise, defensible statements.\n\n8. **Consistency with Naming Policy**  \n   - **Issue:** Asset names are correct, but ensure no underscores or extra words.  \n   - **Action:** Keep “ust10y” as the canonical handle.\n\n**Revised Skeleton (for reference)**  \n- **UST10Y**: 4.23% (3YAQ8JUPL).  \n- **Fed Independence Risk** → higher inflation expectations → term premium → UST10Y rise (GXYXMKIG5).  \n- **Tariff Hikes** (India 50%, steel/aluminum) → supply‑side inflation → term premium → UST10Y rise (3952FOSRQ).  \n- **Tech‑stock Sell‑offs** → risk‑off sentiment → demand for safe assets → UST10Y rise (3YAQ8JUPL).  \n- **Catalyst Window**: Core PCE release 2025‑09‑07 (3YAQ8JUPL).  \n- **Expected Move**: UST10Y +10–20 bp over 0–3 weeks if inflation remains sticky and tariffs persist.  \n- **Invalidation**: Fed rate cut or tariff rollback → UST10Y ↓5–10 bp (GXYXMKIG5, 3952FOSRQ).  \n- **Monitoring**: Watch core PCE, Fed communications, tariff announcements.  \n\nImplement these edits to meet the stringent criteria of truth, mapping, and actionable, concise guidance.",
