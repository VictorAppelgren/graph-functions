  "description": "Forensic experts detail Bryan Kohberger\u2019s panicked phone searches before his arrest in Idaho murders.",
  "content": "Bryan Kohberger saw a news article about a white Hyundai Elantra having been identified as a suspect vehicle in the Idaho student murders and immediately panicked, according to the forensic team that analyzed his phone.\n\n\u201cI think the vehicle was a huge stress point for him, because he had registered it to park there,\u201d said Jared Barnhart, who along with his wife Heather works at the digital forensics firm Cellebrite. \u201cHe had a PDF download of like a list of Hyundai Elantras for the university, you know, and you can see this long list of cars.\u201d\n\nKohberger was attending Washington State University, just 10 miles from the crime scene adjacent to the University of Idaho, and had been pulled over driving near both campuses in the weeks before the murders.\n\nThe car was still on his mind in the hours before his arrest, according to the Barnharts.\n\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t the bad guy, you wouldn\u2019t care, but he was scrambling, and he thought the police were on him,\u201d Jared Barnhart told Fox News Digital. \u201cAnd they were. They were at that point.\u201d\n\nAccording to phone data reviewed by the Barnharts, Kohberger did the following during the late-night hours of Dec. 29, 2022:\n\u2022 Kohberger searched for the phrases \u201cwiretap\u201d and \u201cpsychopaths paranoid\u201d\n\u2022 He read an article about how police were still searching for the suspect vehicle\n\u2022 He visited the Moscow Police Department website and checked the latest press release on the case\n\u2022 He \u201cimmediately\u201d looked up an auto detailing shop\n\u2022 Within 10 minutes, he was shopping online for another car\n\n\u201cLiterally the pressure of, \u2018Oh, look, they\u2019re really talking about my car,\u2019 caused\u2026within 15 minutes of behavior, him trying to clean it and get rid of it,\u201d Jared Barnhart told Fox News Digital. \u201cJust not normal.\u201d\n\nAt around 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 30, police swarmed his parents\u2019 house and arrested him.\n\nPolice found a Ka-Bar sheath at the crime scene that had Kohberger\u2019s DNA on it, which led them to his parents\u2019 house in the Poconos with help from the FBI and state-of-the-art techniques called investigative genetic genealogy.\n\nBut detectives have maintained that even if they didn\u2019t have the sheath, they would have found Kohberger by hunting down leads connected to the suspect vehicle, which appeared on surveillance cameras coming and going from the crime scene.\n\nLast month, after his lawyers failed to convince a judge to throw out key evidence and have the potential death penalty taken off of the table, Kohberger pleaded guilty to the murders of Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20.\n\nAll but Kernodle are believed to have been asleep at the start of the 4 a.m. home invasion attack.\n\nHe received four consecutive sentences of life without parole, plus another 10 years.",

      "text": "Chilling bodycam footage shows survivor describe screams heard the night Bryan Kohberger murdered four Idaho students\nNewly released police bodycam footage captured the chilling moment a survivor recounted the moments Bryan Kohberger slaughtered four University of Idaho students and the horrifying scream he heard.\nMoscow police officers arrived at the murder scene just after noon Nov. 13, 2022, according to bodycam footage, obtained by Law & Crime.\nThe first officers rushed inside past several college-age people to discover the bloody scene on the second floor of the three-story house in Moscow, Idaho.\n\u201cSlow down, just come here. There\u2019s two, looks like fatalities,\u201d the first officer told another cop.\nDuring the house sweep that lasted several minutes, officers discovered the bodies of students Kaylee Goncalves, Maddie Mogen, Xana Kernoodle and Ethan Chapin, who were all brutally stabbed to death.\n\u201cOh, man,\u201d one officer exclaimed over the gruesome discovery.\nOfficers spoke with surviving roommates Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke outside the home at the beginning of the investigation.\nMortensen, whose face was blurred in the video, recalled Goncalves screaming around 4 a.m. before running downstairs, and hearing a strange man\u2019s voice talking to her.\n\u201cI remember I was in my room and I was trying to go to bed and I heard Kaylee. All I heard was her go upstairs and I was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to go to sleep now, \u2019cause she is going upstairs.\u2019 And then all of a sudden I heard her walking up and I heard a scream and she ran upstairs \u2019cause she saw someone,\u201d Mortensen told police.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I\u2019m pretty sure she said \u2018someone\u2019s here\u2019 and she screamed and ran downstairs and I called for her name and I jumped up and locked my door because I was so scared.\u201d\n\u201cI heard her in the bathroom and I heard her crying and I heard some guy say that \u2018You\u2019re going to be OK. I\u2019m going to help you,'\u201d Mortensen recalled. \u201cI kept calling her name and she wasn\u2019t answering.\u201d\nMortensen recalled that the man\u2019s voice, later revealed to be Kohberger\u2019s, was not a calming tone.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it. Like it wasn\u2019t in a nice way. It was a weird way. Like a weird tone,\u201d she said.\nThe University of Idaho student says she ran into the murderous intruder for a brief second when she went to look for Goncalves.\n\u201cI opened the door and that\u2019s when the guy looked at me, but he didn\u2019t come towards me or say anything, which was really confusing to me. I don\u2019t understand that. And I\u2019m pretty sure he went out the side door,\u201d Mortensen said.\nShe described him as \u201cnot insanely tall\u201d but wearing an all-black outfit with a mask that covered his forehead and mouth.\n\u201cHe was a little bit taller than me. I couldn\u2019t really see much of him, but I\u2019m almost positive he was wearing a full black outfit. He had this mask that was just over his forehead and over his mouth and he didn\u2019t say anything to me at all. I just shut the door and locked it \u2019cause I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said.\nMortensen says she called Funke just after 4 a.m. before running downstairs to her roommate\u2019s room, where the two locked the door and talked before falling asleep, not knowing the ghastly horrors upstairs.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think anything of it. We\u2019re like \u2018Nothing happens in Moscow,\u2019 so we just tried to go to bed and then we woke up and it was weird because none of our roommates were up and we called all of them. They were not waking up.\u201d\nThe two woke up around 9 or 10 a.m. and were confused because no one else was awake.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything else, so I called (the other roommate) and I was like \u2018I just need to come downstairs and find you\u2019 \u2019cause I didn\u2019t know where anyone else is. And I called Maddie, I called Xana, I called Kaylee and no one would answer.\nThe friends decided to call other people they knew to come over and check on their roommates, leading to the deadly discovery.\nThe officer pressed the devastated roommate for more information on the suspicious figure she saw in the middle of the night.\nSeveral of the roommates attended a formal the night of the stabbing before returning to the house, Mortensen told police, saying everything was normal.\n\u201cNothing weird at all. Nothing suspicious until 4 a.m.,\u201d she said.\nFunke, who had been waiting on the side of the road with several friends, was asked to recall the events from the night before, saying she had been in bed at 2 a.m. before being awoken by a noise.\n\u201cAm I still allowed to go home for Thanksgiving?\u201d the heartbroken co-ed asked the officer before any questions were asked.\nThe officer reassured Funke that they would work with her to get the help they needed."

      "text": "My small-town beer buddy vented about his creepy teaching assistant all semester \u2014 it turned out to be Bryan Kohberger\nJohn Snyder is a kindly older man who lives in my small town. He\u2019s what you\u2019d consider a normal person \u2014 a married homeowner who teaches at the local university.\nHe\u2019d been a public defender for almost 30 years when he took the opportunity to teach students about the legal system instead of defend them in it, feeling he was nearing burnout in a demanding profession.\nI\u2019ve come to know John pretty well over the years, not just because we live in the same town \u2014 my wife, Alexis, is his favorite bartender, and he likes going out for dinner with his wife or having a beer after work as much as the next guy.\nBut there was a marked theme to John\u2019s happy-hour conversation in fall 2022: His teaching assistant in Washington State University\u2019s Criminal Justice and Criminology Department was \u201can a\u2013hole\u201d who was driving him crazy.\nNormal after-work grumbling, one might think, even if in a high quantity. Then bucolic life in our peaceful region was interrupted in November 2022 when four University of Idaho students were brutally murdered just 20 minutes away.\nAfter the new year, John came into the bar carrying a newspaper and looking bad enough that my wife said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You look like shit.\u201d\nJohn held up the paper and confirmed what we suspected after the arrest: His teaching assistant was Bryan Kohberger.\nJohn Snyder has avoided the media since Kohberger\u2019s arrest, but due to our friendship he agreed to meet me at the Palouse Caboose Bar & Grill, where my wife is a bartender, for some pitchers of beer and his first, and probably only, in-depth interview about supervising Bryan Kohberger.\nJohn graduated from the University of Idaho Law School in 1988 and began working as a public defender, his specialization throughout his legal career, saying, \u201cCriminals are more honest and easier to work with than people going through a divorce.\u201d\nHe was also attracted to the field by his sense of justice and desire to see people who may have disadvantages within society treated fairly by the legal system.\nAnd something of a troublemaker himself \u2014 his skill at pool paid his bar tabs all through law school \u2014 he could imagine being caught making some of the same mistakes as his clients.\nHe occasionally dealt with homicides or other serious crimes, but in a college town it\u2019s mostly young people screwing up.\nJohn doesn\u2019t feel this career has given him any greater ability to sense evil than the average person.\nAs a professor, John had a high volume of students and couldn\u2019t get to know many of them well. Teaching assistants are different, and in normal circumstances one works with them extensively.\nIt used to be that professors chose preferred potential TAs from a list, but for reasons he never discovered, the school abandoned this system and randomized the process, which is how he was assigned Kohberger.\nWhen the graduate student came to introduce himself early in summer 2022, John didn\u2019t think much of him: \u201cHe was a little odd, but a lot of people in academia are odd.\u201d\nDespite the TA-assignment system being designed to prevent this exact problem, Kohberger had a scheduling conflict and thus limited attendance in class, though he also often didn\u2019t show up when available.\nThe infrequency of his class appearances didn\u2019t stop one female student from emailing a friend near the semester\u2019s start, \u201cMy class\u2019s TA looks like a murderer.\u201d\nJohn says he tries to look at TAs\u2019 individual attributes and put them to work where they will be the most useful while training them on their weaker points.\nIn this instance, however, \u201cBryan quickly disabused me of the idea that I would get a sufficient amount of work out of him, and I quickly figured out he was a bit of a douche. And within a few weeks I realized this was going to be an exceptionally long semester.\u201d\nDespite Kohberger missing class, the prof saw him plenty.\nHere\u2019s the latest coverage on Bryan Kohberger:\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s classmates made 13 formal complaints about the killer for \u2018being a d\u2013k,\u2019 making offensive comments: report\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s creepy remark on night of Idaho murders revealed by surviving roommate\n- Eerie leaked videos of Bryan Kohberger with red hands inside cell being probed by Idaho prison\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s phone records unveil similarities to Norman Bates: \u2018Just super eerie\u2019\n\u201cHe rapidly developed the habit of coming in at the end of the day, when I clearly wanted to go home,\u201d he says. \u201cHe would start talking about inane, stupid and immature things. . . . I quickly realized this was a technique where he felt like he was in control as long as he was wasting my time.\u201d\nKohberger once tried to tell John how he was going to get out of a parking ticket, even managing to get him to examine the \u201cscene.\u201d It turned out the TA had parked next to a yellow curb in a lot where he didn\u2019t have a permit anyway.\nAdmonitions that in his experience as a defense attorney, people who believe they know the law better than the courts are always wrong fell on deaf ears.\nJohn says over time Kohberger \u201cwould follow me down the hall yapping, and I started calling it his \u2018terrier routine.\u2019\u201d\nWhen John\u2019s wife was waiting for him in the car once, she saw Kohberger following him and recoiled nearly to the other side, a reaction he\u2019d never seen from her in many years of marriage.\nSnyder had grown to hate Kohberger over the course of the semester but never thought he was dangerous \u2014 he actually considered him a wimp.\nHe learned of Kohberger\u2019s arrest along with everyone else. He was in his office Dec. 30 in a nearly empty building when the custodian told him the police had the basement sealed off.\nThey ended up walking to a picture board of department members, and the custodian started pointing at photos speculating whose office the police might be searching.\nWhen the custodian got to Kohberger, it hit him: His teaching assistant was the murderer.\nThen his phone rang; his brother-in-law told him Kohberger had been arrested. That call was interrupted by his son calling, which was interrupted by the Moscow, Idaho, police calling to set up an immediate interview; he drove to Moscow instead of waiting around for them to show up.\nFrom the police he learned Kohberger had a list of women\u2019s names of unknown purpose \u2014 though surely not anything good \u2014 and one of them was a woman he knew from the department. But overall he wasn\u2019t able to greatly help them besides describing Kohberger\u2019s character.\nHaving worked with a mass murderer was a system shock for John, even if he always disliked the guy.\nThe university\u2019s standard trauma-assistance programs proved unhelpful; the support \u201chotline\u201d he called listed every imaginable identity group besides his own \u2014 old white men \u2014 and then said it could set an appointment in two weeks.\nBut he says the stream of graduate students and undergrads coming into his office to offer support \u201cwas one of the coolest things I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d\nThe department chair also transferred his own excellent teaching assistant to John for the next semester to ease his workload \u2014 and so there would be no more surprises.\nJohn says the reality of the crime isn\u2019t what bothers him \u2014 it is instead someone studying criminology to become a better criminal instead of to pursue justice.\n\u201cIt was the assault on why I do what I do: promote justice and fairness, to find honor where there isn\u2019t any, to teach people to be decent human beings, and to realize that life goes on, and to let people who had not experienced respect from the system know that the power to move past their troubles is inside them.\u201d\nMost of the people he worked with throughout his career were in bad circumstances and needed help out of the abyss, while Kohberger chose to dive into it.\nThough this may be over for the public, for those affected it will never go away, and a feeling of safety is slow to return when you learn you have been in close contact with a monster.\nThis coming year is likely to be Snyder\u2019s last spent teaching, not just because of Kohberger \u2014 he has been working to make a more just society since 1988 and is tired.\nLet\u2019s hope some of the students he\u2019s taught over the last 10 years can pick up the torch and none of them turns out to be the next Bryan Kohberger.\nAs for his former TA, it is John\u2019s belief that being both extremely irritating and physically weak he won\u2019t survive to the end of his natural life in prison.\nBrad Pearce writes The Wayward Rabbler on Substack."

      "text": "Release of Bryan Kohberger rape threat prompts Idaho prison officials to limit access to inmate records\nIdaho prison officials have vowed to limit access to inmate records after releasing a graphic sexual harassment complaint filed by Bryan Kohberger in which the convicted killer begged for a transfer after a fellow inmate threatened to \u201cb\u2014h f\u2013k\u201d him.\n\u201cThe Idaho Department of Correction (IDOC) recently made available public records associated with complaints filed by Bryan Kohberger in response to public records requests submitted by members of the news media and the public,\u201d a department spokesperson told The Post.\n\u201cIDOC seeks to clarify that additional scrutiny will be applied to future requests for public records concerning any individual in IDOC custody,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\u201cThe media and the public can expect that similar public records requests submitted in the future may be denied altogether or may produce records that will be redacted consistent with the Idaho Public Records Act in order to protect the safety and security of the prison population, staff, and our operations,\u201d the IDOC continued.\nThe policy clarification from the IDOC comes as Kohberger, the convicted killer of four University of Idaho undergrads, barely made it one night in the Idaho Maximum Security Institution in Boise before requesting to be moved to another part of the hellhole prison on July 30 over constant harassment, according to documents obtained by People.\nThe request complained of \u201cminute-by-minute verbal threats/harassment,\u201d as well as prisoners flooding their own cells with toilet water and other mischief.\nLess than a week later, Kohberger gave a guard a handwritten note claiming a fellow inmate had threatened to rape him, People reported.\nAnother inmate allegedly said: \u201cThe only a\u2013 we\u2019ll be eating is Kohberger\u2019s.\u201d\nThe IDOC has previously issued a statement downplaying claims that fellow inmates have been tormenting and taunting the convicted killer by yelling through vents.\nThe department also noted that it will \u201ccomply with all applicable laws\u201d when responding to inmate records requests from the media.\n\u201cWe will continue to balance confidentiality, public safety, security, and habilitation with the public\u2019s interest in disclosure,\u201d the IDOC spokesperson said.\n\u201cWe also take reports of threats and harassment seriously. Each matter is investigated thoroughly, and when appropriate, we take disciplinary action in accordance with our policies and the law,\u201d they added.\nKohberger in the prison\u2019s notorious J Block, which houses a mix of general population and death row inmates.\nLong-term prisoners are kept in their own cells, moved in restraints, allowed only one hour of outdoor time each day, and allowed a shower only once every second day.\nThe treatment makes Kohberger\u2019s pre-trial housing in county jails \u2014 in which he took hourlong showers and constantly requested clean clothes and bedding \u2014 look downright ritzy.\nYet even a lifetime in Block J isn\u2019t bad enough for some family members of Kohberger\u2019s victims, who had pushed for the death penalty.\nKohberger dodged the firing squad as part of a \u201cguilty\u201d plea deal for the brutal slayings of undergrads Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin in their off-campus house in Moscow, Idaho."

      "text": "Bryan Kohberger could evade the death penalty over evidence leaked on \u2018Dateline\u2019\nIdaho quadruple murder suspect Bryan Kohberger might avoid the death penalty if convicted because of leaked evidence, a former prosecutor suggested.\nKohberger is accused of killing Madison Mogen, 21, Ethan Chapin, 20, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, and Xana Kernodle, 20.\nOn May 9, a television episode featured leaked information relating to the case, which Kohberger\u2019s attorney has argued will taint the jury pool.\nIncluded in NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d special on the University of Idaho murders was surveillance video from a neighboring house, which caught a car similar to Kohberger\u2019s driving in the King Road area several times in the hours and minutes before the four college students were killed.\nThe episode also featured alleged evidence from a nearby FBI cellphone tower, which claimed to show that Kohberger\u2019s phone pinged nearly a dozen times near a tower providing coverage to an area within 100 feet of 1122 King Road, where the students were killed.\nThe phone allegedly pinged near the tower on multiple occasions between July 2022 and mid-August 2022.\nFormer Assistant U.S. Attorney Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital that the leak has the potential to remove the death penalty as a punishment.\n\u201cThe media leak could help Bryan Kohberger on appeal or potentially take the death penalty off the table. If the leak results in prejudicial pretrial publicity that taints the jury pool, especially if the leak was of inadmissible evidence, that\u2019s a constitutional violation,\u201d Rahmani said.\nRahmani brought up the Lori Vallow Daybell case, where the judge ruled that prosecutors couldn\u2019t seek the death penalty after they didn\u2019t comply with discovery rules.\nVallow Daybell was found guilty after prosecutors alleged that she worked with Alex Cox, her brother, to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, to receive money from a $1 million life insurance policy.\n\u201cThe other basis for appeal or to strike the death penalty would be prosecutorial misconduct or a violation of a judicial order.\nIn a recent high-profile Idaho capital case, Lori Vallow Daybell, the court ruled that prosecutors could no longer seek the death penalty because they failed to comply with their discovery obligations,\u201d Rahmani said.\nHere\u2019s the latest coverage on Bryan Kohberger:\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s classmates made 13 formal complaints about the killer for \u2018being a d\u2013k,\u2019 making offensive comments: report\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s creepy remark on night of Idaho murders revealed by surviving roommate\n- Eerie leaked videos of Bryan Kohberger with red hands inside cell being probed by Idaho prison\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s phone records unveil similarities to Norman Bates: \u2018Just super eerie\u2019\nOn May 15, Judge Steven Hippler said a violation of the gag order was \u201clikely\u201d committed by someone involved in the case.\nHe ordered the prosecution and Kohberger\u2019s defense team to preserve all communications and data relating to the case, including law enforcement officers who worked on the case.\nHippler said the following pieces of evidence were revealed during the episode:\n- Surveillance footage of \u201cSuspect Vehicle One\u201d\n- AT&T records for Kohberger\n- Content of Kohberger\u2019s cellphone\n- Photographs and information associated with Kohberger\u2019s Amazon account.\n\u201cSuch violations not only undermine the rule of law, potentially by persons charged with upholding it, but also significantly impede the ability to seat an impartial jury and will likely substantially increase the cost to be borne by the taxpayers of Latah County to prosecute this case by extending the time it will take to seat a jury and potentially requiring lengthy period of juror sequestration,\u201d Hippler wrote.\nKohberger\u2019s lawyer, Anne Taylor, asked Hippler to delay the trial because the jury pool could be tainted by information aired during the \u201cDateline\u201d episode, in addition to other reasons.\nProsecutors argued in a court filing that the airing of information relating to the case should not be a reason to delay August\u2019s trial start date.\n\u201cLike the court in the Vallow-Daybell trial, this Court is well-equipped to select a jury, to handle ongoing media coverage, and to conduct a fair trial in the Ada County courthouse,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nTimeline of Nov. 13, 2022:\n- 4 a.m.: Suspect arrives at house\n- Between 4 and 4:17: Time of murders\n- 4:19: Roommate calls three victims; no one answers\n- 4:22 to 4:24: Surviving roommates text each other from inside house\n- 4:27: Roommate calls victims again; no one answers\n- 4:32: Roommate texts Goncalves, \u201cPls answer\u201d\n- 10:23: Surviving roommate texts victims; no one answers\n- 11:39: Roommate calls her father\n- 12 p.m.: 911 call placed from roommate\u2019s phone.\nAn amended scheduling order filed in Idaho\u2019s Fourth Judicial District Court on Thursday indicated that the trial will be pushed back one week.\nJury selection will begin on Aug. 4, but opening statements are now expected on Aug. 18, one week later than the previously anticipated start date on Aug. 11.\nA court spokesperson said the updated timeline was not the result of any attempt by the defense to delay the proceedings, but rather an internal scheduling adjustment by the court.\nFox News Digital reached out to Kohberger\u2019s lawyer, prosecutors and NBC for comment."

      "text": "Bryan Kohberger may have used second weapon and left \u2018scared\u2019 while sparing surviving roommate: report\nIdaho prosecutor Bill Thompson said investigators can\u2019t rule out the possibility that Bryan Kohberger used a second weapon during the murders of four University of Idaho students and believes the killer spared surviving roommate Dylan Mortensen because he panicked and fled, according to an interview with the Idaho Statesman.\nThompson explained that some injuries observed on victim Kaylee Goncalves, 21, appeared to have been caused by something other than the knife used in the attack, though he stopped short of confirming a second weapon.\n\u201cThere were injuries that appeared to have been caused by something other than the knife, although it could have been the knife,\u201d Thompson told the Statesman. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can exclude the possibility that there was an additional weapon involved.\u201d\nCourt documents revealed the extent of the November 2022 attack on Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin.\nGoncalves, authorities revealed in recently released Moscow Police Department documents, endured \u201cmore than 20 stab wounds,\u201d alongside blunt-force trauma.\nRegarding why Mortensen, a surviving roommate, was left unharmed despite encountering Kohberger as he fled the scene through the rental property\u2019s sliding door, Thompson said it appeared Kohberger panicked.\n\u201cFrom what Dylan described, I have a hard time imagining that the killer did not see Dylan,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAt that point, he\u2019d been in the house probably longer than he planned, and he had killed more people than he planned. It wouldn\u2019t surprise us that the killer was scared at that point and decided they had to leave, not knowing if law enforcement already had been called.\u201d\nMortensen shared with authorities that she had noticed an intruder with \u201cbushy eyebrows\u201d on the night of the attack on 1122 King Road in Moscow, who had told her that he was \u201chere to help.\u201d\nJames Fry, who was chief of the Moscow Police Department at the time, told ABC News that there are many theories as to why Mortensen survived, including that Kohberger may have been exhausted from the quadruple murders.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, only he has that answer,\u201d Fry told the outlet.\nThompson also emphasized the critical role DNA evidence played in solving the case.\n\u201cFrom our perspective as prosecutors, the DNA was critical to the strength of the case for trial purposes,\u201d he said.\nWithout the DNA linking Kohberger to the knife sheath, securing a conviction might have been \u201cinsurmountable,\u201d Thompson told the Statesman.\nFox News Digital has reached out to the Latah County Prosecutor\u2019s Office for comment."

      "text": "Bryan Kohberger saw a news article about a white Hyundai Elantra having been identified as a suspect vehicle in the Idaho student murders and immediately panicked, according to the forensic team that analyzed his phone.\n\"I think the vehicle was a huge stress point for him, because he had registered it to park there,\" said Jared Barnhart, who along with his wife Heather works at the digital forensics firm Cellebrite. \"He had a PDF download of like a list of Hyundai Elantras for the university, you know, and you can see this long list of cars.\"\nKohberger was attending Washington State University, just 10 miles from the crime scene adjacent to the University of Idaho, and had been pulled over driving near both campuses in the weeks before the murders.\nThe car was still on his mind in the hours before his arrest, according to the Barnharts.\n\"If you weren't the bad guy, you wouldn't care, but he was scrambling, and he thought the police were on him,\" Jared Barnhart told Fox News Digital. \"And they were. They were at that point.\"\nAccording to phone data reviewed by the Barnharts, Kohberger did the following during the late-night hours of Dec. 29, 2022:\nBRYAN KOHBERGER CALLED HIS MOM WHILE RETURNING TO IDAHO MURDER SCENE THE NEXT DAY, EXPERT REVEALS\n- Kohberger searched for the phrases \"wiretap\" and \"psychopaths paranoid\"\n- He read an article about how police were still searching for the suspect vehicle\n- He visited the Moscow Police Department website and checked the latest press release on the case\n- He \"immediately\" looked up an auto detailing shop\n- Within 10 minutes, he was shopping online for another car\nBRYAN KOHBERGER PLEADED GUILTY TO IDAHO STUDENT MURDERS, BUT THESE KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED\n\"Literally the pressure of, 'Oh, look, they're really talking about my car,' caused...within 15 minutes of behavior, him trying to clean it and get rid of it,\" Jared Barnhart told Fox News Digital. \"Just not normal.\"\nAt around 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 30, police swarmed his parents' house and arrested him.\nPolice found a Ka-Bar sheath at the crime scene that had Kohberger's DNA on it, which led them to his parents' house in the Poconos with help from the FBI and state-of-the-art techniques called investigative genetic genealogy.\nBut detectives have maintained that even if they didn't have the sheath, they would have found Kohberger by hunting down leads connected to the suspect vehicle, which appeared on surveillance cameras coming and going from the crime scene.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nLast month, after his lawyers failed to convince a judge to throw out key evidence and have the potential death penalty taken off of the table, Kohberger pleaded guilty to the murders of Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20.\nAll but Kernodle are believed to have been asleep at the start of the 4 a.m. home invasion attack.\nHe received four consecutive sentences of life without parole, plus another 10 years."
