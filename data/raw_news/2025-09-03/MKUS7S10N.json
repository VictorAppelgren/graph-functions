  "title": "Microsoft's laying down the law to Windows 11 PC makers to help combat wonky USB-C ports",
  "description": "Microsoft is pushing PC makers to ensure USB-C ports work correctly",
  "content": "\u2022 Microsoft's attempting to bring PC makers in line to make sure USB-C ports are properly configured\n\u2022 A poor setup by the manufacturer could lead to USB-C ports not working as they should, or not producing the correct notifications\n\u2022 Microsoft's urging the use of the Windows Hardware Lab Kit to fully validate USB-C ports\n\nMicrosoft is trying to bring the makers of Windows 11 PCs in line when it comes to ensuring that all USB-C ports work correctly.\n\nIf you've ever bought a new PC and found it has a misfiring port, while it isn't generally a showstopping experience, it's certainly going to be frustrating; particularly if you're short on ports with a laptop, say. And flaws with USB-C ports can be caused by PC makers not configuring them properly.\n\nWindows Latest reports that Microsoft recently wrote a blog post on what OEMs (PC makers) need to know about USB-C ports and relevant notifications in Windows 11, which highlighted issues around these ports being mislabeled.\n\nThat includes a USB-C connector being labeled as USB-A, or vice versa, which in the case of the former will hamstring the functionality of the port. Data won't be transferred as fast as it should be, and charging will be slower, for example (as the system thinks that the USB-C port is USB-A).\n\nFurthermore, notifications about problems with a USB-C port won't be displayed if it's misidentified as USB-A, so you'll miss out on troubleshooting details or warnings - such as if the laptop is charging slowly over the USB-C port, or if there are issues when connecting a USB device.\n\nThese capabilities may not work if the PC manufacturer hasn't properly set up the Windows Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) driver. And, as mentioned, if the connectors are mislabeled as being the wrong type (USB-A rather than USB-C).\n\nSo, to address these problems, Microsoft is making it clear that PC makers should be using the Windows Hardware Lab Kit as part of the process of configuring a new Windows 11 device. This tool allows for testing drivers, validating USB ports to ensure they're correctly set up, and more.\n\nProper validation using the Hardware Lab Kit should ensure that flaky or malfunctioning USB ports become a rarer occurrence. There could still be manufacturing defects with a port - or any component - but at least incidents of misconfiguration by the PC maker can be much reduced this way.\n\nThat's if the companies producing PCs following Microsoft's guidance, of course, and a key part of this move will be how that's enforced. Particularly when it comes to cheap, unknown PC brands, who are the manufacturers more likely to rush the setup of a device and get things wrong.\n\nIn short, this is a great move in theory, but how the practical side of it pans out, and whether certain low-budget PC makers listen to Microsoft, might be another story.\n\nLaying down the law like this should have a positive impact, though. Furthermore, this latest initiative comes on top of a scheme revealed earlier this year that's designed to ensure consistency with USB-C ports, meaning that every connector delivers all key aspects of the standard's functionality (data transfer, power delivery - charging - and output to a display).\n\nWhen combined, these two strides forward should help make USB-C ports a lot less confusing, and a good deal more reliable on Windows 11 PCs, which has got to be a good thing. Perhaps the main question here is: why haven't these initiatives been implemented before now?\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Microsoft exec's vision of Windows 12 and beyond could terrify some of you\n\u2022 Latest Windows 11 update packs a great new feature \u2013 but I hope I never have to use it\n\u2022 Microsoft promises to crack one of the biggest problems with Windows 11: slow performance",

This stylish, powerful device with a long-lasting battery has firmly earned its place at the top.\nMicrosoft is branding the model released in 2024 simply as the Surface Laptop, underscoring its significance despite being the seventh iteration. This isn't just marketing hype; the Surface Laptop is a genuine reinvention. Powered by the revolutionary Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip, Windows 11 runs fast and responsive, with impressive battery life and minimal fan noise.\nAs a flagship in the new 'Copilot+ PCs' range, the Surface Laptop boasts deeply integrated AI features, including the Copilot assistant and Cocreator tool, which transforms your Paint scribbles into AI-generated art.\nMost of these features operate on-device thanks to the Snapdragon X chip, ensuring your data is secure and you don't need an internet connection. While the AI features are still developing and not yet essential, their potential is enormous. Even without them, the Surface Laptop stands out as the best Windows laptop, finally presenting a true MacBook killer.\nRead the full Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 review\nEditor's note: In 2025, Microsoft launched another model, the Surface Laptop 13-inch, which is a smaller, lighter and cheaper model, and well worth considering.\nThe best budget Windows laptop\nSpecifications\n\u2705 You\u2019re on a budget: The Aspire 5 is a high-end laptop for video-editing work, but its entry-level model only costs around $600/\u00a3450.\n\u2705 You travel a lot: It's sturdy design and weight of just 1.7kg mean that it'll will happily live in your backpack all day long.\n\u274c You\u2019re a gamer: Most Aspire 5 models rely on more basic integrated graphics.\n\u274c You need all-day battery life: 6.5 hours of battery life isn\u2019t bad for a laptop in this price range, but it is if you need a long-lasting laptop for work.\nNo budget Windows laptop is as good as the Acer Aspire 5, which offers so many configurations covering different display sizes and your choice of integrated and discrete graphics that the line has something for pretty much every user. What's more impressive is that this entry-level model provides respectable performance for a laptop in this price range.\nYou\u2019re not going to get a cutting-edge design, but it gets the basics right, from its sturdy chassis to its comfortable keyboard and fingerprint sensor on the trackpad. And the 1080p 14-inch screen is bright, clear, and comes with good viewing angles.\nBeing a budget option, there are compromises here: the 720p webcam is a bit basic, the built-in speakers are somewhat feeble, and connectivity is a bit of a mixed bag. However, they aren't deal-breakers either. You're definitely getting great value for your money here.\nRead our full Acer Aspire 5 (2022) review\nEditor's note: While the Acer Aspire 5 is still on sale at an even lower price, it's also showing its age, and will be removed from this list in our major October 2025 update to this page. For more recent affordable Windows laptop picks, check out our reviews of the Acer Swift 14 AI and Dell Inspiron 14 Plus, which both offer fantastic value for money with more modern components and features.\nThe best 2-in-1 Windows laptop\nSpecifications\n\u2705 You want all-day battery life: The battery life on the Surface Pro is as good or better than you'll find on any other Windows laptop.\n\u2705 You want to use the laptop like a tablet: With its detachable keyboard, this laptop is truly a 2-in-1 device.\n\u274c Money is tight: It's not exactly a budget option. Look elsewhere if you need something under $1,000/\u00a31,000.\n\u274c You want to do any kind of serious gaming: The integrated Adreno GPU in the Surface Pro is not equip for gaming, unfortunately.\nWith its exceptional design, stunning display, and impressive battery life, the Microsoft Surface Pro 11 stands as the best Windows 2-in-1 laptop available.\nSurpassing the iPad Pro in functionality with its full Windows 11 OS, the Surface Pro 11 may have slightly lower performance compared to the latest iPad Pro with Apple M4, but it still excels in benchmark tests and has no significant weaknesses for most users.\nThe design and battery life of the Surface Pro 11 are particularly impressive. It offers an optional 2.8K OLED display with incredible color accuracy, making it a worthy upgrade. Additionally, it features a 1440p webcam and a solid, lightweight build. The battery life not only meets Microsoft\u2019s 14-hour claim but even approaches 15 hours in local video playback tests, showcasing the power efficiency of Arm architecture.\nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 11 excels in all areas, setting new standards for what users expect from a top-tier Windows 2-in-1 laptop. With more developers releasing Arm-compatible apps and additional AI features on the horizon, this laptop is poised to become even more remarkable.\nRead the full Microsoft Surface Pro 11 review\nEditor's note: Microsoft recently released the Surface Pro 12, which is a more modern 2-in-1 device. However, our pick for the best 2-in-1 Windows laptop is the excellent Lenovo Yoga Book 9i, which will be added to this guide in our October update.\nThe best thin and light Windows laptop\nSpecifications\n\u2705 You want a low-cost Ultrabook: This is easily one of the most affordable Ultrabooks on the market and it comes with plenty of features that make it a great buy.\n\u2705 You want a sleek and practical design: It's lightweight and thin with a lovely well-built chassis, a great screen, and a high-quality keyboard and touchpad.\n\u274c You want a good GPU: The GPU, despite being the same kind as most other laptops, has been throttled to death.\n\u274c You want a long-lasting battery: Six hours isn\u2019t enough to get through a whole day. If you prize a long battery, look elsewhere.\nThe Acer 3 Swift OLED is the follow-up to one of the best laptops ever made, and this refresh doesn't disappoint in the slightest. This lightweight and thin notebook in a lovely well-built chassis belies an incredible CPU performance, which has some of the best we've seen from an Ultrabook.\nIn fact, it\u2019s one of the highest-scoring laptops we\u2019ve ever tested - almost every result is at least the highest number in its category. Of course, the GPU performance is no slouch either, ensuring that you can work and play with ease. And while the battery life may not be the longest, it's actually pretty decent.\nThough it's not a touchscreen, its main draw is its gorgeous OLED display that also supports HDR. This screen is one of the most beautiful we\u2019ve seen on a laptop. Meanwhile, the keyboard balances a smooth and sleek design with a satisfying feel. Rounding it all out is the incredibly affordable pricing that makes it an absolute steal.\nRead our full Acer Swift 3 OLED (2022) review\nEditor's note: The Acer Swift 3 OLED is now showing its age, and will be removed in our next major update to this buying guide. For a more modern thin and light Windows laptop, check out the Dell 14 Premium instead.\nThe best gaming laptop\nSpecifications\n\u2705 You\u2019re a hardcore gamer: This has both the looks and the performance to suit those who need the full experience on the move.\n\u2705 You\u2019ll appreciate a big, high-res screen: The higher-spec tiers of the Alienware m17 probably offer more pixels than your games truly need, but this is a bold, beautiful panel that refreshes fast.\n\u274c You value portability: Although the m17 isn\u2019t over-heavy it\u2019s most at home in the home.\n\u274c You\u2019re concerned about your budget: This is no-compromises gaming, with a price tag to match.\nIt might be fairly expensive at $2,350 (around \u00a31,950 / AU$3,410) for the model we reviewed, so this will be one to skip if you're on a tight budget, but the Alienware m17 R5 'AMD Advantage' edition is an absolutely mighty Windows gaming laptop, delivering top-notch performance both in games and in creative workloads.\nAs we noted in our review, it's really unclear whether credit should lie with Dell or AMD for producing such an excellent laptop, but we're happy either way. The internal components pull their weight in practically every area, and the sleek Alienware chassis packs a nifty cooling solution that keeps your system running smoothly.\nStill not sold on it? Well, the 4K 120Hz display is absolutely magnificent, giving more expensive gaming laptops a serious run for their money. The keyboard has full RGB lighting, which is aesthetically appealing but not over-the-top, and while the battery life isn't spectacular, it outstrips the majority of gaming laptops in its weight class. The Alienware m17 R5 AMD Advantage is one of the best Windows gaming laptops you can buy right now - end of story.\nRead our full Alienware m17 R5 AMD Advantage review\nEditor's note: The Alienware m17 R5 is now several years old, and we'll be replacing it in our October 2025 update with the Razer Blade 16 (2025).\nThe best budget gaming laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a very affordable gaming laptop: At a starting price of $600 and one that won\u2019t exceed $1,200 with all the upgraded specs, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a cheaper gaming laptop around.\n\u2705 You want a well-rounded laptop: Not only can this laptop run most games pretty well, it has features and ports that make it well-suited for other tasks.\n\u274c You want a long-lasting battery: If you need a battery that can hold its own off the charging cord, this is not the one for you.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for a stylish laptop: While the design is simple and sustainable, it is rather boring\nThe HP Victus 15 is proof that you don\u2019t need to splurge on an expensive Windows laptop for gaming to enjoy great performance. Much like with many budget offerings, there are a few concessions here. The laptop, while sturdy, is a bit chunky, which means it isn\u2019t the most travel-friendly gaming machine. Its design is also basic, but the fact that it\u2019s partially made of post-consumer recycled and ocean-bound plastic makes up for it, especially if you\u2019re big on sustainability and having a lower carbon footprint.\nIn terms of performance, we found the battery life disappointing as well, as it gave us a little over four hours during our battery tests. The good news is that this is made for the desk, rather than for travel anyway so you can keep it plugged.\nEven better news, its performance and heat management are hard to beat. At lower settings, you should be able to enjoy the most demanding games without frustration. It\u2019s also a monster at multitasking, which makes it ideal for work, school, and entertainment.\nRead our full HP Victus 15 review\nHow to choose the best Windows laptop for you\nWhen it comes to choosing the right Windows laptop, you have to take into account what you want out of it. Maybe you\u2019re looking for a powerhouse for gaming or other intensive tasks like video editing. Or, maybe you prefer something that\u2019s portable and ideal for checking emails and basic productivity work.\nIf performance is a priority, you\u2019ll want something that comes with higher-end components such as a fast processor, a decent amount of RAM \u2013 16 GB is a good target to shoot for \u2013 and discrete graphics such as one of Nvidia\u2019s 5000 series GPUs. If you just need to do basic day-to-day computing, you won\u2019t need anything that robust. You still will want internals that can keep up in a few years' time, however, so make sure to get a portable with a current generation processor, and at least 8 GB of RAM. And, while storage space can be expanded through any of the best portable SSDs, you should make sure that whatever you choose has enough for your needs.\nWhen it comes to portability, take into account not only the size and weight of the notebook you\u2019re considering but also its battery life. After all, it needs to have enough juice to last a workday without needing a charge. Keep in mind that more powerful laptops with discrete graphics, ones meant for gaming in particular, tend to come with shorter battery lives.\nAnd, of course, make sure you\u2019re getting the proper size for your needs. Laptops typically come in 13, 15, and 17-inch models (though recently we've been seeing lots of 14, 16 and 18-inch laptops as well). If portability is your top priority, a smaller 13-inch or 14-inch model is probably going to be your best bet. However, if you need to balance portability with performance, 15-inch and 16-inch models tend to hit that sweet spot. While 17-inch/18-inch models are ideal for someone who wants a portable with a lot of power and a lot of screen space for easier multitasking (or when playing games).\nBeyond that, you should consider the kinds of ports and features you need out of your portable. Some come with just a few USB-C ports while others include SD card readers and HDMI ports for easy use with external monitors. And, some come with security features that you won\u2019t find with every portable, such as a fingerprint reader, webcam cover, or Kensington lock.\nIf you can narrow down what kind of performance, portability, battery life, size, and features you expect out of that next Windows laptop, you\u2019ll be able to find the right one in no time.\nToday's Best Windows Laptop Deals\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nChristian is TechRadar\u2019s UK-based Computing Editor.

      "text": "Microsoft imposes new rules on Windows 11 laptop makers to ensure they don\u2019t cut corners with key features of USB-C ports\nUpdate to standard ensures every USB-C port is consistent\n- Microsoft has new rules to ensure more consistency with USB-C ports\n- This means every USB-C port will offer data, power, and display support\n- Previously, you weren\u2019t guaranteed to get all of those basic elements if laptop makers cut corners with their connectors\nGoing forward, the USB-C ports on Windows 11 laptops will be held to more consistent standards that mean users can expect a minimum amount of functionality with any given connector.\nTom\u2019s Hardware noticed Microsoft\u2019s blog post explaining a fresh update to the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (WHCP) that\u2019s designed to end confusion around USB-C ports. The broad idea is to ensure every single one of these connectors deliver certain key features in terms of data transfer, power delivery (charging), and running an external monitor.\nCurrently, while the USB-C specification encompasses all those separate elements \u2013 and a lot of versatility for the port therein \u2013 parts can be missing with connectors on some laptops, as it\u2019s not mandatory to include everything.\nMicrosoft has changed this with its new way of working, observing that: \u201cWhile the USB specifications give PC manufacturers the ability to choose which optional features the port supports, we set out to establish a minimum bar for USB-C port capabilities on PCs.\u201d\nThat baseline bar means that with Windows 11 laptops (and tablets), all USB-C ports must provide display support (to connect a monitor), PC charging support (power), and of course data transfer (which all USB connectors do, of course) at a certain speed.\nFurthermore, Microsoft notes that any port which supports USB 40Gbps will work fine with both USB4 and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals.\nThese updated WHCP requirements have come into play with Windows 11 24H2, and notebooks running 24H2 will already support them.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAnalysis: Consistency with connectors\nWith the old way of working, the practicality of USB-C ports is that you might buy a laptop which comes with a few of these connectors, and be quite happy chugging along using them for USB sticks or charging. Then, one day, when you plug in a monitor, you\u2019ll suddenly find out that your ports don\u2019t support a display, because the laptop maker produced these USB-C connectors without that particular capability (to save a bit of money).\nThe problem is there\u2019s no clear labelling on a USB-C port, and you may not find out about any missing pieces of the functionality puzzle until you come across them in this way \u2013 and it\u2019s too late at that point.\nWith the new minimum standard in place, all USB-C ports on WHCP-certified Windows 11 laptops will definitely support all those three basic pillars: power, display, and data transfer.\nNow, note that there are still variations in the specs of USB-C ports, in terms of how many displays they may support, or how much power the USB cable will deliver, and the speed of data transfers (all of which should be made clear in the notebook\u2019s spec).\nSee the screenshot above for the details, but the central point is that from now on, you know that all three of the fundamental bases are covered with at least some level of functionality when you\u2019re buying a new Windows 11 laptop \u2013 with every single USB-C port on-board the device \u2013 which has to be a good thing.\nYou might also like...\n- macOS Tahoe rumored to follow Sequoia \u2013 here\u2019s 3 things to expect from Apple\u2019s next desktop OS\n- Can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11?

      "text": "Microsoft is urging OEMs to ensure Windows 11 can correctly identify USB hardware issues and notify users when the PC is charging slowly or data is not transferring as fast as it should.\nMicrosoft maintains transparency, and it often releases advisories for OEMs (PC makers) publicly. As spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft internal tests found that some OEMs mislabel a Type-A port as Type-C or vice versa.\nWhile a casual consumer may not really notice the difference, it leads to unexpected performance. It also means Windows 11 won\u2019t be able to correctly tell that there is a problem with the USB Type-C port. That happens when the USB Type-C port is internally labelled as Type-A, and Windows does not understand when to notify users.\nWindows 11 24H2 offers improved USB Type-C error reporting\nMore recent Windows updates, such as the Windows 11 version 24H2, improve USB Type-C reporting, so if your device is charging slowly or you\u2019ve attached an unsupported accessory, Windows can identify the error and send a toast notification.\nAs you can see in the above screenshot, if you go to Bluetooth & Devices settings, and then open the USB page, you\u2019ll find toggles for USB connection-related issues. For example, there\u2019s a toggle that allows Windows to show alerts when the PC charges slowly over USB.\nIt\u2019s also possible to block USB devices when the battery saver is turned on or Windows is trying to save battery. This can prevent USB-connected phones from charging.\nBut that\u2019s not all. Windows Latest found that Windows has a full-fledged mechanism to identify when the USB connection is faulty, so you know the issue is not with the operating system. But these features may not work when an OEM has shipped the device with missing or incorrect ACPI markup.\nAccording to a support document, ACPI stands for Windows Advanced Configuration and Power Interface. It\u2019s a driver that handles power management and plug-and-play features of the USB ports.\nIt\u2019s all good when the port is set to \u201cuser-accessible.\u201d If Windows ACPI identifies a USB Type-C port, but the driver notices that the port is not configured as user-accessible, either the port won\u2019t work correctly all the time, or Windows won\u2019t send you alerts when there are problems with the USB connection. In rare cases, it also leads to BSODs.\nLast but not least, Microsoft\u2019s internal tests found that OEMs also incorrectly mark a port as internal, which leads to fewer or zero notifications around the USB Type-C connection.\nA port can be for internal hardware connections or external, and Windows does not send alerts for internal ports, which makes sense. But when a port designed for external use is marked as internal, it\u2019s a problem because Windows would still not send the alerts. That\u2019s because it\u2019s being told that the port is for internal use only.\nMicrosoft wants OEMs to build high-quality USB Type-C ports\nMicrosoft is urging PC makers to use the Windows Hardware Lab Kit (HLK), which is an audit tool for driver testing, and to validate USB ports. If followed strictly, this could lead to fewer problems with USB Type-C connections and also allow Windows to correctly identify issues, including when your USB port is wet and should not be connected.\nMicrosoft also wants OEMs to test their USB ports under different \u201cconditions,\u201d including an underpowered adapter, so Windows can pick up those scenarios and correctly tell users that they need a new adapter.\nPreviously, Microsoft announced that OEMs need to level up the USB Type-C game and stop shipping devices with ports that do not really meet the industry standards. Now, we have a new announcement for USB Type-C notifications.\nBut the question is, how strict are these \u2018enforcements\u2019? We know OEMs are required to follow the rules now, but cheaper PCs, even those built by reputed PC makers, often have issues with USB. Could these recent \u2018nudging\u2019 from Microsoft finally improve the Windows hardware quality? Only time will tell.."

      "text": "Windows 11 includes built-in USB Type-C troubleshooting notifications designed to help users identify and resolve issues like slow charging, unsupported accessories, and faulty connections. These notifications are part of a broader effort to improve device reliability and user experience.\nWhile our previous post focused on the user experience, this update is for OEMs highlighting what\u2019s required to ensure these notifications function correctly on your platforms.\nWhy Notifications Might Not Appear\nUSB Type-C notifications rely on accurate platform configuration. If notifications aren\u2019t showing up, it\u2019s often due to:\n- Missing or incorrect ACPI markup: Windows uses ACPI descriptors to identify USB Type-C ports and their capabilities. If the port isn\u2019t correctly marked as user-accessible or Type-C, notifications may not trigger.\n- Incorrect connector type reporting: Mislabeling a Type-A port as Type-C (or vice versa) can lead to unexpected behavior or missed alerts.\n- Internal vs. external port confusion: Ports marked as internal may suppress notifications even if they\u2019re physically accessible to users.\nValidation and Testing\nTo ensure compatibility:\n- Use the Windows Hardware Lab Kit (HLK) to validate USB port descriptors.\n- Confirm that _UPC (USB Port Capabilities) and _PLD (Physical Location of Device) ACPI methods are correctly implemented.\n- Test with various charging scenarios, including underpowered chargers and hubs, to verify that notifications appear as expected. The link below has a table of the notifications and expected behaviours.\nSecurity Considerations\nSome OEMs may choose to disable data over USB Type-C in untrusted environments. If implementing such features:\n- Ensure the policy applies only to externally accessible ports.\n- Consider offering user toggles for data disablement.\n- Validate that disabling data doesn\u2019t interfere with critical internal devices (e.g., touchpad, keyboard).\nRecommendations for OEMs\n- Audit ACPI descriptors and USB Device-Specific Method for all USB ports.

      "text": "Thunderbolt vs USB: Which is the best port?\nUSB ports have become incredibly important to both desktop PCs and laptops, being used for charging, data transfers, connecting monitors and devices, and more. However, not all ports are built the same.\nWhile USB ports and Thunderbolt ports do share plenty of similarities, there are key differences that could end up influencing your hardware buying decision. But which one should you focus on more when buying a PC?\nIn this article, we'll break down what each type of port does as well as their benefits and drawbacks to help you make an informed buying decision, whether you're looking to purchase one of the best laptops, best desktops PCs, or simply want to better understand the specs for a device you already have.\nSo read on to find out all about Thunderbolt vs USB ports and cables.\nThunderbolt vs USB: What is USB?\nUSB (or Universal Serial Bus) is an electronics industry communication standard that allows different devices to talk to each other.\nIt is an open standard, which means anyone can implement it in their products so long as they meet specific technical requirements, and as such it has become the de facto way for peripherals and devices to connect to each other. Also, it's increasingly becoming the default charging method for a wide range of products from laptops to smart home devices.\nStarting with USB Gen 3.1, USB can come with the Type-C connector, which is a wide, flat, and versatile interface that makes connecting devices almost as easy as a 3.5mm headphone jack - and the latest generation of USB, USB4, will only have Type-C connectors. Previous generations of USB might still feature older Type-A and Type-B connectors, but those are quickly aging out of the market.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThunderbolt vs USB: What is Thunderbolt?\nThunderbolt is similar to USB in terms of function, but it only just recently became compatible with USB Type-C.\nDeveloped and owned by Intel and introduced by Apple for the MacBook Pro in 2011, Thunderbolt is a data communications standard that grew out of the early Mini DisplayPort standard for video and audio signals to include support for power and data transfer alongside A/V.\nThe first couple of generations of Thunderbolt used a Mini DisplayPort connector, but starting with the third-generation standard, Thunderbolt uses the same Type-C connector as the updated USB standard.\nAlso starting with Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt is compatible with any USB Type-C device.\nThunderbolt vs USB: Interoperability\nWhile Thunderbolt and USB Type-C are now compatible with each other, there are quirks as to how they interface with each other.\nTo take advantage of Thunderbolt speeds, display and peripheral support, and charging capability, both connected devices will need to have a Thunderbolt port, with a compatible Thunderbolt cable to connect the two.\nUsing a Thunderbolt 4 cable, for example, won't give you the faster speeds promised by that standard if you plug it into a Thunderbolt 3 port or USB-C Gen 3.2 port, and connecting two Thunderbolt 4 ports with a USB-C Gen 3.1 cable will likewise throttle the connection to the slowest common standard in the chain, which is USB-C Gen 3.1.\nThat said, Thunderbolt 3 and 4 ports and cables are compatible with USB-C ports and cables, so you can use them together just fine, but the maximum connection speed will be limited to the slowest standard involved.\nIt means that no matter what you pick, you can always use older tech with these newer (though more expensive) cable types and vice versa. However, to take full advantage of the latest Thunderbolt or USB technology, you'll need to make sure you're connecting two like ports (so Thunderbolt 3-to-Thunderbolt 3 or USB4-to-USB4) with a cable that matches the standard of the two connected ports, otherwise you're going to have an inconsistent experience.\nThunderbolt vs USB: Data transfer & charging\nThe latest USB-C connections (USB4) can transmit data between devices at speeds of up to 40Gbps (the exact ceiling depends on the port's specific USB SuperSpeed rating) and can deliver nearly 100W of power to charge your phone, tablet, or laptop battery (with a minimum of 7.5W power transfer required by the standard).\nThunderbolt 4 transfers data at up to 40Gbps, which is four times as fast as the first-gen Thunderbolt standard, and double what Thunderbolt 3 was capable of (20Gbps). The supported PCI Express data rate is also as high as 32Gbps, which is fast enough to use an external GPU with an Ultrabook for high-end gaming or content creation.\nTake things further to Thunderbolt 5, which has been announced but has yet to fully make its way to market, and you're looking at even faster data transfer rates of up to 80Gbps, or up to 120Gbps in one direction (like output to a single monitor).\nIn terms of power delivery, Thunderbolt 5 will be able to support up to 240W, with a minimum required delivery of 140W, making it ideal for fast-charging beefy devices like laptops.\nIn this regard, Thunderbolt is the clear winner between the two standards as it generally offers faster transfer and charging speeds than USB-C, as well as longer cables without sacrificing speed. That makes Thunderbolt perfect for backing up data to external hard drives, transferring data between devices, and very quickly charging devices.\nThunderbolt vs USB: Linking monitors & devices\nThe latest USB and Thunderbolt standards are capable of connecting monitors and devices between each other and to PCs, but the type of connection also determines what devices (and how many) can be connected.\nUSB-C Gen3.2 and USB4 support DisplayPort A/V signals for connecting your device to a USB-C monitor, but USB-C Gen 3.1 does not. USB4 can support up to 8K video at 60Hz, but it cannot support daisy-chaining devices (where you can connect multiple devices along a chain, including one or more monitors, using only one device port).\nMeanwhile, a single Thunderbolt 4 cable can transmit a video signal for two 4K monitors at 60Hz or one 8K monitor at 60Hz.\nWith the recently announced Thunderbolt 5 standard, both Thunderbolt 5 and USB4 will be able to support up to a single 16K display, while Thunderbolt 5 will be able to support two 8K monitors at 60Hz or up to three 4K monitors at 144Hz.\nThunderbolt 5 will also be able to push a refresh rate of up to 540Hz at lower resolutions, making it ideal for gaming monitors.\nThunderbolt vs USB: Security\nSecurity is surprisingly important when it comes to port and cable types, as malware and viruses can easily spread between connections. So when it comes to security, both port types have this in spades.\nUSB got a major upgrade back in 2019 with a cryptographic-based 128-bit authentication system that helps defend against non-compliant USB chargers, USB sticks laden with malware, and other assorted dangers.\nThunderbolt 4, meanwhile, features Direct Memory Access (DMA) protection, enhancing the security against potential threats by preventing unauthorized memory access.\nIn this particular area, both standards have security measures to protect your data and your devices from threats. Thunderbolt may be more advanced in this regard, but USB is still quite reliable, so you can choose either and be well-protected - though don't rely on a USB standard as your sole security solution. Make sure you have antivirus protection on your devices as well.\nThunderbolt vs USB: Which to choose?\nOverall, Thunderbolt ports and cables win out as the type we recommend. It outperforms standard USB in nearly every area, all while maintaining backward compatibility with the latter so you can still use your older devices.\nHowever, USB is still pretty much universally beloved and compatible with almost every device. Also, Thunderbolt technology is owned by Intel, so device manufacturers must license it for use in their products, which increases the final cost for the user.\nUSB, meanwhile, is an open standard, so anyone can implement it in their products, generally making USB cheaper to use. And its specs are still impressive, not falling too far behind Thunderbolt, so in terms of a budget-friendly option, this is the way to go.\nUltimately, however, only the most demanding user is going to fully utilize all of the features that make Thunderbolt great. For most people, the more prevalent USB ports and cables are going to be more than enough for their needs, and in rare cases where you have a choice, going with USB is one way to help keep within your budget.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2023 Media Trailblazer, Allisa is a Computing Staff Writer who covers breaking news and rumors in the computing industry, as well as reviews, hands-on previews, featured articles, and the latest deals and trends.

      "text": "Confused about why you can't upgrade to Windows 11? Microsoft has some new advice that might help... including a trick I wasn't aware of\nRecent support documents offer tips to overcome some stumbling blocks\n- Microsoft recently produced some new support documents\n- These contain some helpful advice for would-be upgraders to Windows 11 who run into problems\n- Some of this is very handy to know - including why you may not immediately be offered Windows 11 after upgrading your CPU\nMicrosoft recently provided some fresh troubleshooting advice for those looking at upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11 who might be confused in some respects.\nNeowin noticed a couple of relatively new support documents which have been published by Microsoft at some point earlier this year. They deal with problems that may arise after upgrading the hardware in your PC in order to get Windows 11, or encountering a particular message telling you that some aspect of the upgrade 'needs attention'.\nLet's start with the former scenario which is covered in a support article on 'checking if a device meets Windows 11's requirements after changing hardware' and imparts advice for those who have just made an upgrade to ensure their Windows 10 PC can meet the more stringent requirements for Windows 11.\nThat upgrade is most likely to be a new CPU - as older processors are often a major sticking point - or possibly the addition of a TPM 2.0 module (a security feature).\nAt any rate, whatever hardware change you've made to your PC so it's eligible for Windows 11, you may find that when you fire up Windows Update in order to trigger the upgrade, that it isn't there. In other words, the system will tell you that your PC still isn't compatible with Windows 11, even though you've just installed that shiny new component which should do the trick.\nHowever, as Microsoft explains, there's no need to panic here. It's actually the case that it \"can take up to 24 hours for Windows Update to refresh eligibility info\", meaning that you may need to wait for some time before the hardware change filters through and registers with Windows Update - and you're then offered Windows 11.\nIf you can't wait, there's a trick to manually refresh the eligibility assessment of your PC (using Task Scheduler, as advised here), or the easier route is to use the PC Health Check app rather than going into Windows Update (as the app will immediately recognize your upgraded hardware, Microsoft informs us).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAs for the second support document brought to light, this addresses what to do if you see a 'What needs your attention' notification during the Windows 11 upgrade process, which is a certainly something of a vague spanner in the works.\nMicrosoft explains in detail what this is all about, outlining the reasons why a would-be Windows 11 upgrader might see this notification pop up - including an explanation of the rather cryptic 'no action is needed' message that may accompany it. In this case, the user can't do anything - which you might guess - but what you might not guess is that the known issue causing the message may be resolved by Microsoft in time. And if this happens, you will automatically be offered the Windows 11 upgrade - so, there's still hope in this scenario.\nMicrosoft also details what you can do about 'incompatible privacy settings' if that's the cause of the notification, and provides more info on what to do if incompatible software is the issue.\nAnalysis: Better late than never\nThese are handy clarifications to be furnished with, especially the info on the delay with an upgrade to Windows 11 being cleared on your PC, if you're proceeding via Windows Update after installing new hardware.\nThose not aware of this (and I wasn't) could potentially upgrade their CPU (say), then spend hours searching the web in vain attempting to find out why they still can't get Windows 11, if they didn't try the PC Health Check app as well as Windows Update (which is entirely possible). So, that app is clearly your best bet for a simple, immediate upgrade to Windows 11 after you've installed the necessary new hardware to meet the requirements of the OS.\nIdeally, mind, all these details should have been in place a long time ago. Better late than never, of course, but Microsoft really should have been more on the ball with some of this info, rather than adding it recently, at this late stage in the game - no doubt prompted by the fact that Windows 10's End of Life is rapidly coming into view.\nYou might also like...\n- Microsoft promises to crack one of the biggest problems with Windows 11: slow performance\n- Microsoft finally plays its trump AI card, Recall, in Windows 11 \u2013 but for me, it\u2019s completely overshadowed by another new ability for Copilot+ PCs\n- Microsoft has all but given up on Windows 11 SE \u2013 and it looks like the war against Chromebooks has been lost\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

Windows Insiders are encouraged to provide feedback when experiencing PC issues related to slow or sluggish performance, allowing Feedback Hub to automatically collect these logs, which will help us root cause issues faster.\"\nEssentially, Microsoft is attempting to expand the quantity and scope of logs relating to performance issues that it's receiving, in order to better deal with speed-related niggles in Windows 11.\nThe logs pertaining to performance issues are stored in a temporary folder on the system drive, and Microsoft says they're only sent across to the company when the user submits feedback (via the Feedback Hub, where there's a new section for reports of 'system sluggishness').\nAnalysis: exploring new avenues of improvement\nThere have been a good few complaints about performance hiccups \u2013 or indeed more serious failings \u2013 with Windows 11, so it's good to see Microsoft launch a fresh initiative to help combat these issues (with any luck \u2013 the results, of course, remain to be seen).\nSluggish search functionality and wonkiness with File Explorer performing sub-optimally have been a couple of obvious problems that Windows 11 has caused for some users. Granted, not everyone has suffered from these kinds of woes, although I've certainly experienced File Explorer sluggishness on my Windows 11 laptop (but not on my desktop PC).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThese are frustrating issues to be faced with, given that they're key pieces of the interface which really shouldn't be going awry, and hopefully testers will get behind this effort, as it would be good for all concerned if Microsoft can get a better handle on improving the performance of Windows 11 for those who find it lacking (especially on older PCs \u2013 like my notebook, which is a venerable Surface model \u2013 where any shortcomings are more likely to be noticeable).\nFinally, it's worth making clear that data on incidents of sluggish performance is only being collected through preview builds of Windows 11, so those logs are just kept on the PCs of testers, not normal users of the release version of the OS.\nAnd, as noted, logs from testers are only sent to Microsoft voluntarily, so even if the data itself is collected automatically, it doesn't leave your drive until and unless you submit a feedback post.\nYou might also like...\n- Windows 11's handheld mode spotted in testing, and I'm seriously excited for Microsoft's big bet on small-screen gaming\n- No, Windows 11 PCs aren't 'up to 2.3x faster' than Windows 10 devices, as Microsoft suggests \u2013 here's why that's an outlandish claim\n- macOS Tahoe 26: here's everything you need to know about all the new features\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "Latest Windows 11 update fail brings yet more installation woes \u2013 but some other reported bugs have me seriously worried\nThe July update for Windows 11 24H2 is proving troublesome\n- A new update for Windows 11 24H2 is failing to install for some\n- While this has happened before, reports seem more prevalent with the July update\n- There are also other concerns such as overheating issues and buggy mouse behavior\nWindows 11's latest update (for version 24H2) is refusing to install for some folks \u2013 which isn't a new problem \u2013 and there are scattered reports of other concerning issues with the July update.\nWindows Latest reports that it suffered an installation failure itself, whereby the update appeared to work, but upon rebooting to finish, Windows 11 ending up rolling back the upgrade (with an error).\nNumerous readers of the tech site have echoed that experience, with the July update either failing completely for them (not even reaching the reboot phase) or getting stuck before hitting 100%. There are other reports of the update actually freezing the PC, requiring a hard reset, too.\nOn top of that, there are multiple complaints on Reddit about installation failures, all of which are happening with the usual weird and unhelpful error codes (such as '0x8007371b' to pick an example, which means precisely nothing \u2013 and Googling won't help either).\nIn that Reddit thread, there are also various reports of all kinds of issues, some of which may only be affecting individual users \u2013 and which may be outliers with their system \u2013 but there are a few notable bugs that pop up repeatedly.\nThey include a user's mouse stuttering after applying the update \u2013 or the \"mouse blinking the loading icon every two seconds\" \u2013 as well as general performance issues, and crackling audio in a couple of cases.\nSome folks are also encountering heat-related issues, with one complaint that the update made a Snapdragon X Plus laptop run hotter. Another person said their notebook is also struggling with heat and high GPU usage, with others observed high CPU temperatures.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThere are also a fair few problems reported with USB peripherals and docks.\nFinally, Microsoft said an issue with the Windows 11 firewall whereby it's logging errors that are actually false, has been resolved with the July update, but a lot of users are stating that it hasn't.\nSo, if you see firewall-related errors at all, just ignore them. The good thing is this is a completely harmless bug, and nothing is actually amiss with the system firewall. The error messages themselves are the errors, ironically.\nAnalysis: keep a watchful eye on these bugs\nWhile complaints about updates failing aren't uncommon, there appear to be more than normal with this most recent update for Windows 11. Okay, so the odds are very much that you won't run into this bug, and these are likely still relatively isolated incidents in the bigger picture. However, the fact that these issues seem more prevalent than usual is still a red flag.\nIf you encounter such an installation failure, you can try to manually install the July update instead (from the Microsoft Update Catalog). I wouldn\u2019t recommend that for anybody but more tech-savvy Windows 11 users, mind \u2013 for most folks, I would just suggest you wait until the installation problems are ironed out by Microsoft. Yes, you will be without the latest security patches for a while, which isn't ideal \u2013 so bear that in mind and be extra safe in terms of your browsing (or other computing) habits.\n(There's no guarantee a manual install will work, either, it's worth remembering \u2013 some on Reddit have observed that only a full reinstallation of Windows 11 did the trick for them, which is obviously a very drastic step to take. An in-place upgrade is another option explained in that post, though again this is only for the more technically confident).\nThe promised firewall solution \u2013 which doesn't work \u2013 is an odd one, though a fix failing to actually resolve a bug as intended is hardly a first for Microsoft. Still, it isn't an actual problem, as noted.\nSome of the overheating issues are far more worrying, but as reports are still relatively thin on the ground, we can't jump to conclusions just yet. These are definitely worth monitoring, though, to see if more complaints along these lines pop up. Ditto with the erratic mouse behavior and glitches with USB peripherals.\nYou might also like...\n- No, Windows 11 PCs aren't 'up to 2.3x faster' than Windows 10 devices, as Microsoft suggests \u2013 here's why that's an outlandish claim\n- Windows 11 desktop PCs could soon get Copilot+ AI powers, as Intel might radically switch tactics with next-gen CPUs\n- macOS Tahoe 26: here's everything you need to know about all the new features\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "Microsoft exec's vision of Windows 12 and beyond could terrify some of you\nOthers may welcome AI and cloud-powered advances, though\n- Another Microsoft executive has detailed their vision of a future Windows\n- Pavan Davuluri, VP of Windows and Devices, echoes the thoughts previously laid out by Microsoft's VP for OS Security, David Weston\n- The overall vision is for more AI, and an OS that watches what you're doing on-screen, tapping into the cloud, which may worry the privacy conscious\nAnother Microsoft executive has provided their vision of the future of Windows, specifically framed around AI and the cloud, and how this - and voice input - is going to be a big part of the operating system down the line.\nWindows Central discovered a YouTube interview with Pavan Davuluri, VP of Windows and Devices at Microsoft. See the video clip below, and be warned, the technobabble is strong with this one. Davuluri says at one point: \"Computing [will] become more ambient, more pervasive, continue to span form factors, and certainly become more multi-modal in the arc of time.\"\nOkay, so let's boil this - and the rest of the interview - down a bit. Computing becoming more \"multi-modal\" refers to using inputs beyond the traditional mouse and keyboard, and the exec touches on voice commands as an important part of the equation. This echoes what Microsoft's VP for OS Security, David Weston, said earlier this month when explaining his vision of Windows in 2030.\nDavuluri also says, \"Fundamentally, the concept that your computer can actually look at your screen and is context aware is going to become an important modality for us going forward.\"\nAgain, that follows up on what Weston observed about the next-gen Windows PC being able \"to see what we see, hear what we hear, and we can talk to it and ask it to do much more sophisticated things.\"\nThe key idea appears to be Windows watching what you're doing, using AI to determine context, and then applying that to your actions in the OS, and specifically making voice commands more useful due to that context.\nDavuluri notes: \"You'll be able to speak to your computer while you're writing, inking, or interacting with another person. You should be able to have a computer semantically understand your intent to interact with it.\"\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe exec also talks about Windows becoming \"increasingly agentic\" (with the first AI agent recently having debuted in the Settings app in Windows 11, of course), and how the cloud will be needed to power these AI abilities. (Although some of the work will be on-device, he indicates, as we see with Copilot+ PCs already - hence the need for NPUs with these laptops.)\nDavuluri observes: \"Compute will become pervasive, as in Windows experiences are going to use a combination of capabilities that are local [processed on the device] and that are in the cloud. I think it's our responsibility to make sure they're seamless to our customers.\"\nWhich is a roundabout way of saying that the level of processing needed for some of these AI powers in next-gen Windows will need to tap the cloud to ensure performance remains responsive enough to feel 'seamless' rather than sluggish.\nAnalysis: A computing paradise - or Big Brother nightmare?\nMicrosoft has clearly got a hymn sheet somewhere, as its top-level executives appear to be singing the same tune regarding how Windows will evolve as we head into the next decade.\nIt's interesting to pick up on the mirrored points between these two interviews Microsoft has recently presented: more AI (surprise, surprise) that determines context by watching what you're doing on-screen, and also allows voice commands to be more effectively used based on that context - with the cloud at least partly powering all this.\nDepending on what kind of person you are, this may sound like an exciting new way forward in terms of making it easier to do what you need to do within Windows, or a privacy nightmare.\nThe more paranoid-leaning Windows users out there are likely to be horrified at the suggestions made about the future of the OS here. An operating system that's watching what you do? The way they'll read this angle from Microsoft is that it's turning Windows into an AI-powered surveillance platform - you can guarantee that.\nAnd it's obvious where such concerns come from when we're told the \"computer can actually look at your screen\" and take context from there, and leverage the cloud (read: Microsoft's private servers) to crunch the data on what you're doing with your PC.\nIf this makes using next-gen Windows a breeze, and AI is constantly firing up the apps you need, or searches you want to make, before you get to them, or proactively suggesting files you might want next - or Windows options that could be changed for your benefit in given scenarios - will people even care about what's happening in the cloud? Frankly, the truth is, they probably won't if it makes their computing lives a lot easier.\nYou might also like\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "'It's obvious that users are frustrated': consumer rights group accuses Microsoft of not providing a 'viable solution' for Windows 10 users who can't upgrade to Windows 11\nPIRG believes Microsoft still isn't doing enough to help those stuck on Windows 10\n- Microsoft recently threw a lifeline to consumers, offering alternatives to paying $30 for extended support for Windows 10\n- PIRG thinks this doesn't go far enough in terms of avoiding an impending e-waste calamity\n- The organization suggests Microsoft considers providing longer-term support for Windows 10, or relaxes the spec requirements for Windows 11\nMicrosoft's recent lifeline to help those stuck on Windows 10 \u2013 due to not meeting the stricter hardware requirements for a Windows 11 upgrade \u2013 simply isn't enough, according to a consumer rights group.\nThe Register reports that it has spoken to Lucas Rockett Gutterman, who leads the Designed to Last campaign for the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) in the US.\nAs you may be aware, PIRG has a mission to combat obsolescence and e-waste. The organization has previously levelled accusations at Microsoft of its Windows 11 requirements effectively shoving hundreds of millions of otherwise perfectly serviceable PCs into landfill, come the end of Windows 10 in October 2025. (The organization isn't alone in that, either.)\nYou may have seen that last week, Microsoft made a concession on this front. We've long known that one option for consumers will be to pay $30 for an additional year of security updates (something that's never been offered before), but now Microsoft just introduced some other choices too.\nInstead of forking out cash, you can elect to use the Windows Backup app to sync all your settings to the cloud (OneDrive). Alternatively, you can redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.\nHowever, Gutterman remains distinctly unimpressed with the new choices, telling The Register that: \"Microsoft's new options don't go far enough and likely won't make a dent in the up to 400 million Windows 10 PCs that can't upgrade to Windows 11.\"\nGutterman adds that: \"What [Microsoft hasn't] done is commit to automatically providing longer support for Windows 10 or loosening the hardware requirements for Windows 11.\"\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n\"It's obvious that users are frustrated,\" Gutterman concludes. \"They feel yanked around and don't think this [latest] announcement provides a viable solution.\"\nAnalysis: thinking beyond a one-year extension\nTo be fair to Microsoft, I think that giving Windows 10 users a couple of new options to avoid paying $30 to keep security updates going for an extra year (through to October 2026) is actually a very positive move \u2013 especially because simply using the Backup app isn't a particularly hefty imposition.\nI can see where Gutterman is coming from with the points he makes, but the suggestion that Microsoft might consider loosening the system requirements for Windows 11 is, I feel, rather a waste of breath. That isn't going to happen at this point, and I think the software giant has been pretty clear on that.\nFor me, the key point raised is providing Windows 10 support beyond an extra year for consumers, and this is something I've been harping on for some time. While businesses can get a three-year program of extended security updates (if they want that much), so far Microsoft is only offering consumers a single year.\nPerhaps the software giant feels that this is enough, but it really isn't \u2013 not when it comes to keeping all those olds PCs off the scrapheap. Why isn't Microsoft looking at extending support for multiple years for consumers too, from an eco-friendly angle?\nJust a second additional year of support would be some welcome extra breathing room, even if Microsoft charged for it rather than offering any kind of alternative angle like using the Backup app. Of course, a non-paying option would be better. I'd even suggest making Windows 10 ad-supported to keep those security updates coming for two or three years.\nWhat do you mean that's already happened and ads are all over the place? Ahem \u2013 in all seriousness, I think allowing Microsoft to push more ad notifications (in a still limited fashion) within Windows 10 would be a compromise many would take, rather than paying extra to keep their non-Windows 11 compatible PC alive through to 2027 or 2028. At least suffering the adverts would have a plus side to it in this scenario, and if you can't stand the idea of yet more ads, you can stump up the $30.\nWhatever the case, I fully agree with PIRG that a one-year extension for consumers isn't good enough in terms of Microsoft's responsibilities towards preventing excessive e-waste \u2013 and hopefully the company will see the sense in further extended updates for consumers, too, not just businesses.\nYou might also like...\n- No, Windows 11 PCs aren't 'up to 2.3x faster' than Windows 10 devices, as Microsoft suggests \u2013 here's why that's an outlandish claim\n- Windows 11's hidden PC migration feature proves Microsoft isn't messing around when it comes to killing off Windows 10\n- Can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11?

      "text": "Latest Windows 11 update packs a great new feature - but I hope I never have to use it\nQuick Machine Recovery looks nifty, but pray you never need it\n- Windows 11's August update is now available\n- It comes with a new feature aiming to recover a PC that won't boot\n- There's also an important fix to iron out stability problems gamers are having with Windows 11 24H2\nWindows 11 has a new update available that makes some smart introductions, including a fresh PC recovery ability and a vital fix for gamers.\nThe August patch for Windows 11 24H2 (known as KB5063878) brings in a new Quick Machine Recovery (QMR) feature that's a very welcome addition, but it's something I profoundly hope that I'll never have to actually see.\nThat's because this functionality \u2013 which is inbound for all Windows 11 users, as highlighted by Windows Latest \u2013 is designed to help recover your PC from a boot failure. That's the most awful of computing scenarios where you can't even get to the desktop, and obviously, that makes it difficult to troubleshoot whatever's gone wrong with your system.\nIn these cases, QMR represents a new choice in the Windows Recovery Environment (which can be accessed to attempt to recover a non-booting PC), whereby Windows 11 uses a local network connection to send diagnostic data regarding the system-halting problem to Microsoft. The idea is that this data can (hopefully) be used to find a solution, and that this cure can be automatically patched through.\nIn short, your PC will fix itself, which is a great idea, obviously, although as I already said, I hope to never use this functionality, because I'd rather not encounter a boot failure in the first place. (These are rare incidents, thankfully.)\nThere's also a big addition for Copilot+ PCs with the August patch, which is the deployment of the first-ever AI agent in Windows 11. This 'Windows Agent' resides in the Settings app and offers a way of finding the options that you need with a minimum of fuss. Essentially, it's an AI-powered search that uses natural language - so you can ask questions in a conversational manner, and it'll also suggest recommended settings for whatever you're looking for.\nWhile that change is for Copilot+ laptops only, there's also a tweak that traditional Windows 11 PCs are getting, whereby the search box in Settings has been moved to a better, more visible position, centred at the top of the panel.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThis latest patch also makes the Black Screen of Death \u2013 a more streamlined version of the old Blue Screen \u2013 official, though I have my doubts about whether this is an improvement.\nThe August update for Windows 11 also fixes the various game-related stability issues that have been present in version 24H2, which is a huge boon for gamers - and there's a new gamepad layout for the virtual keyboard of the OS, too.\nFor further details on this patch, see my breakdown of the preview release that came out late in July, which is essentially the same update (when it was still in testing as an optional upgrade).\nAnalysis: Slick quick fix trick?\nThe highlight here, at least in terms of the features coming to all Windows 11 PCs (not just Copilot+ devices), is Quick Machine Recovery (QMR). This feature will live or die on whether it works well, and how useful it proves in resolving boot failures \u2013 although that said, any chance of some extra help in getting your PC to actually reach the desktop will be handy.\nThe good news is that Windows Latest has tried out QMR and observed that it's been implemented well enough (albeit the tech site didn't get to test it with an actual boot-halting issue).\nIt's worth noting that when Microsoft previously tested QMR in preview builds, the company said that it would be switched on by default for all Windows 11 Home users. That makes sense, as there's really no reason not to turn on this functionality for everyday folks (business users will have the decision made by their IT admins).\nOkay, so maybe some home users won't like the idea of sending any data via the cloud to Microsoft, but when it's diagnostic info that could cure your PC so it boots, saving you a major headache in the process, I think even the more paranoid would concede this is a more than worthwhile trade-off. And if Microsoft doesn't have QMR on by default, the average user may never be aware of the feature, or benefit from it should their PC hit a showstopping bug that prevents it from booting up.\nAside from that, the gaming fix is a big one too. Some gamers running Windows 11 24H2 have been seriously frustrated by crashes in the likes of Fortnite, so hopefully this will bring down the curtain on that sorry episode. (24H2 has been very problematic for PC gamers, as you may recall.)\nThe AI agent is a great addition for Copilot+ PCs, and using AI to bolster search is a theme Microsoft is pushing ahead with \u2013 it's an obvious way to give more depth to a commonly used ability in different areas of Windows. Previously, Microsoft pepped up Windows 11's main search (via the box in the taskbar) with AI, which was good to see. Furthermore, Recall is another such trick for Copilot+ PCs, albeit one I remain unconvinced about.\nYou might also like\n- Microsoft finally fixes one frustrating Windows 11 pop-up \u2013 just as a more irritating one arrives to take its place\n- Microsoft promises to crack one of the biggest problems with Windows 11: slow performance\n- Microsoft has all but given up on Windows 11 SE \u2013 and it looks like the war against Chromebooks has been lost\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.
