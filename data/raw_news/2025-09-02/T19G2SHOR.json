  "description": "KC Joyner gives a bold prediction for every NFL team. Can Patrick Mahomes be a top-six QB? Joyner thinks so.",
  "content": "With the fantasy football draft season closing out, it\u2019s time to jump ahead and dive into what will happen during the 2025 campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s also time for bold fantasy predictions for every NFL team, to assist fantasy managers who want or need to upgrade their rosters ahead of the Week 1 kickoff.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the metrics detailed below are from TruMedia/PFF or Pro Football Reference/Stathead.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Marvin Harrison continues his boom/bust scoring profile.\n\nHarrison scored 15+ PPR points in eight games last year, which is a great base. However, he also scored only 45.2 PPR points in the nine games where he didn\u2019t score 15+ PPR points, largely due to Kyler Murray\u2019s abysmal vertical pass (10+ air yards) skills. Since 2022, Murray hasn\u2019t finished higher than 24th in air yards per attempt. Even the addition of Harrison didn\u2019t fix the problem, so the second-year receiver will continue to be a boom/bust player whose bust games will hurt his fantasy teams.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Drake London is a top-five WR.\n\nLondon has many paths to success. Last year, he ranked 11th in short PPR PPG and 13th in overall PPR PPG. He had more red zone targets than all other Atlanta WRs combined in 2024 and more inside-the-10-yard-line targets than all other Falcons players. With the development of Michael Penix and a 91 score in my matchup points metric (1-100 scale, higher is better), London has a good chance of landing in the top-five scorers at the position.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Mark Andrews is a top-three fantasy TE.\n\nAndrews had some injury rust early last year, leading to 3.4 or fewer PPR points in three of the first four games. Once the rust wore off, he returned to his elite form, scoring 14+ PPR points in all but three of the final 12 games of the season. Andrews\u2019 health to begin 2025 may offset the potential for touchdown regression, after he led the league in red zone touchdowns (among all players, not just tight ends) last season. He also has the most favorable tight end coverage schedule and could finish the season as a top-three TE.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Keon Coleman has a WR3-caliber season.\n\nColeman ranked second on the Bills in stretch vertical targets last year (targets of 21+ air yards). He was also second on the team in red zone and inside-the-10-yard-line targets. Coleman did this in a year when he was acclimating to the NFL. Buffalo now knows it can lean on him even more this year, giving him a good chance at posting a WR3-caliber campaign.\n\nYoung ranked ninth in QB PPG in Weeks 12-18 last season. During that time, he posted three games with 23+ points and five games of 16.5+ points. Young tapped into his rushing prowess in that span with five rushing touchdowns in seven games. The Panthers added Tetairoa McMillan to the mix this season and returned all five offensive line starters, a combination that can propel Young into the top 20 at this highly competitive position.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Caleb Williams is a solid QB1 this year.\n\nAs noted in my top-five over- and undervalued players article, last year, Williams was only the third quarterback in the Super Bowl era to post 75 or more rushing attempts and score zero rushing touchdowns. Ben Johnson will fully utilize Williams\u2019 rushing skills, so the QB\u2019s touchdown volume should increase. The Bears also made multiple offensive line upgrades and added Colston Loveland and Luther Burden via the draft; Williams can jump to mid-tier QB1 status.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Tee Higgins falls short of his borderline WR1/WR2 ADP valuation.\n\nHiggins is a key part of the Bengals\u2019 passing attack, but Cincinnati may try to avoid the scoreboard shootouts that plagued their 2024 campaign and rely more on the ground game. Higgins is likelier to lose targets than Ja\u2019Marr Chase if that happens. Higgins has never posted more than 74 receptions in a college or pro season. He\u2019s still apt to be a quality fantasy wideout, but not likely to reach the borderline WR1/WR2 level.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if David Njoku falls short of TE1 numbers.\n\nLast year, Cleveland ranked first in the league in pass attempts and 28th in rush attempts \u2014 not the offense that head coach Kevin Stefanski likes to operate. Changing back to a run-heavy approach will lead to a target crash diet for every Browns pass catcher and disproportionately hurt Njoku\u2019s production since he was second among tight ends in short pass targets per game. Njoku could move out of the TE1 tier.\n\nFerguson should benefit from having Dak Prescott in the lineup more often this year, but he also has a lot working against him. Dallas is likely to go more run-heavy under head coach Brian Schottenheimer. Long passes will be tough to come by in an offense that will lean on CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens in that area. Ferguson had only four red zone targets last year and may not improve upon that, given the strength of Lamb and Pickens there. He also faces the most difficult tight end pass coverage schedule, meaning Ferguson is projected to fall far down the TE2 tier.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Denver\u2019s DST finishes first in fantasy points by a wide margin.\n\nStudies I\u2019ve done over the years indicate that pass rush impact (an area that includes sacks, turnovers off sacks, interceptions on hurries and other related items) accounts for roughly 50% of DST value. Denver returns all but 1.5 of its league-leading 63 sacks, so the Broncos should dominate in this area. No other DST comes close in this area. Denver\u2019s DST also has a very favorable pass-blocking schedule. These factors are why the Broncos rank first in my DST rankings by a wide margin, and they should lead to a decisive No. 1 ranking come season\u2019s end.\n\nWilliams was one of only three wide receivers to post a 10+ yards per target on 75 or more targets last year, and Detroit\u2019s coaching staff doesn\u2019t view that as his ceiling. New offensive coordinator John Morton has indicated that Williams could have a true breakout year with even more long passes sent his way. Williams can hold up to a larger work volume (he had 82 receptions in his incredible 2021 season at Alabama). It wouldn\u2019t take many more long passes to push Williams to the border of the WR1 level, so it should not be a surprise if he contends for that tier.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Jordan Love is a borderline QB1.\n\nAs noted in my top-25 quarterback rankings article, Love was one of only four quarterbacks to post top-six numbers in both vertical and stretch vertical PPG last year \u2014 despite dealing with groin and knee injuries. A healthy Love could do even better, especially after Green Bay added speedster Matthew Golden to the receiving corps. Those talents will get maximized with a schedule that could include many high-scoring showdowns. Love could post borderline QB1 points despite a current ADP of 17.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Jayden Higgins ends up as a high-end WR4.\n\nIn Houston\u2019s offense, Higgins is in line to take over the Tank Dell role \u2014 primarily a vertical one that perfectly complements the Nico Collins all-around role. Higgins had a Power 4 leading 60 receptions of 10+ yards last year, a pace that indicates his quick-hit abilities hold up under a large workload. Higgins also has superb red zone skills. He led the Big 12 in red zone catches and receiving yards last season. That\u2019s an excellent trait for a team that vacated a ton of red zone targets and can lead to a high-end WR4 point total that outperforms his low-end WR5 ADP.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Tyler Warren is this year\u2019s Brock Bowers.\n\nPenn State is to tight ends what LSU is to defensive backs, and Warren is the best tight end in Nittany Lions history. He set the program career tight end records for receptions, receiving yards, receiving touchdowns and 100-yard receiving games. Warren also set the Big Ten single-season record for receptions and receiving yards. He\u2019s big (6-foot-5, 256 pounds) and wicked smart (a four-time Academic All-Big Ten honoree with two degrees). It\u2019s a formula that should result in Day 1 impact. Warren could also mimic (or at least get close to) Brock Bowers\u2019 incredible 2024 season this year.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Travis Hunter is an upper-tier WR2.\n\nHunter joins an offense that had only one player with 50+ receptions last year. Trevor Lawrence has a proven track record in vertical passing, so Hunter\u2019s highlight reel of downfield skills ought to be fully utilized in this offense. Hunter was the Academic All-American of the Year in 2024, so getting up to playbook speed at the NFL level should be a breeze. Jacksonville has indicated he is a wide receiver first and cornerback second, so there shouldn\u2019t be many worries about his defensive work interfering with his offensive production. Add it up, and Hunter can produce well above his mid-tier WR3 ADP.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Patrick Mahomes returns to top-six QB status.\n\nMahomes hasn\u2019t been in the upper-half of the QB1 rankings since finishing first in QB points in 2022 \u2014 a trend that could change this season. Mahomes was only 3 points shy of a top-six showing in QB PPG from Weeks 8-17 last year. The Chiefs\u2019 offense gets Hollywood Brown back, and Travis Kelce looks recommitted to finish his career on a high note. Kansas City has also upgraded its offensive line. Head coach Andy Reid has indicated that he\u2019s committed to the vertical pass game, so Mahomes should return to the mid- to upper-tier QB1 level.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Ashton Jeanty is the highest scoring RB in Weeks 1-6.\n\nJeanty and Barry Sanders are the only FBS players to post 2,600 or more rushing yards in a single season, making Jeanty the perfect candidate to take over the Marshawn Lynch role in head coach Pete Carroll\u2019s offense. That huge work level gets an early-season force amplifier with four green-rated rush defense matchups in Weeks 1-6, which should be enough to give Jeanty a very good shot at being the highest scoring fantasy RB in that time frame.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Ladd McConkey is a mid-tier WR1.\n\nMcConkey ended last season with a seven-game streak of 14.3 or more PPR points. Ja\u2019Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson were the only other wide receivers with a streak of that caliber in 2024. McConkey was also in the top 24 in PPR PPG at every route depth level and posted superb inside-the-10-yard-line metrics. With HC Jim Harbaugh aiming to increase the Chargers\u2019 pass volume this year, McConkey could finish as a mid-tier WR1 this year.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Davante Adams is a borderline WR1/WR2.\n\nAdams did something incredible last year. He managed to post WR1-caliber numbers in non-PPR and PPR scoring environments despite switching teams in the middle of the season and missing three games \u2014 on teams without the pluses that the Rams offense has. He\u2019s also a perfect complement to Puka Nacua. There\u2019s enough right for Adams to vastly outplay his No. 19 WR ADP.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Tyreek Hill is a low-tier WR2.\n\nHead coach Mike McDaniel had to abandon the long pass last year to help protect Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s health. With Tagovailoa still a durability question mark, Miami may again have to go with a dink-and-dunk pass approach, which is no good for Hill, who is entering his age-31 season. There\u2019s also potential for McDaniel to lose his job during the season; Hill could land near the bottom of the WR2 tier.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if J.J. McCarthy is a low-end QB1.\n\nA Minnesota quarterback has finished in the top nine in quarterback points in two of the past three seasons (Sam Darnold ranked ninth in 2024; Kirk Cousins ranked eighth in 2023). Head coach Kevin O\u2019Connell knows how to get the most out of his quarterbacks. McCarthy is every bit as talented as Darnold and Cousins, and he has a tremendous receiving corps. The Vikings also lead the league in my fireworks points metric that measures how likely a team will get into scoreboard shootouts \u2014 a recipe for a low-end QB1 point total for McCarthy, if all goes well.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if TreVeyon Henderson ends up as an RB1.\n\nThe Patriots got abysmal production from Rhamondre Stevenson last year. He ranked 22nd in PPR PPG among the 27 running backs with 200+ scrimmage plays. New England drafted Henderson to solve this problem. He ranks fifth in career rushing yards, third in career touchdowns and third in career all-purpose yards in Ohio State history. He also had an 11.1 yards per reception mark, which could make him the primary pass-catching back in this offense. If Henderson hits the ground running, he could relegate Stevenson to alternate back status and post low-end RB1 numbers.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Alvin Kamara falls out of the top-20 RBs.\n\nKamara has posted seven straight seasons with 250+ scrimmage plays, tied for 16th in NFL history, and only one season away from tying for 10th. Kamara is also only 16 catches away from placing fourth in NFL history in receptions by a running back. That\u2019s a great track record, but it\u2019s also a lot of wear and tear for someone headed into his age-30 season. It won\u2019t be a shock if Kamara wears down as the go-to player in this mediocre Saints offense and falls outside of the top-20 fantasy RBs.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Malik Nabers lands in the bottom half of the WR1 tier.\n\nNabers had 109 receptions last season. Only 10 players in NFL history have posted back-to-back seasons with that catch volume, so a repeat is far from assured. Nabers also has a brutal schedule. There are seven red-rated cornerback matchups in Weeks 1-15 and only two green-rated matchups; he has the lowest matchup points total at the wide receiver position. Nabers could fall more than a few spots below his No. 5 WR ADP.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Braelon Allen vastly outplays his RB4 ADP.\n\nJets head coach Aaron Glenn will likely apply the Detroit blueprint to turn New York\u2019s fortunes around \u2014 including dividing the running back work in a way similar to how the Lions split the work between Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery. Allen should have plenty of carries behind a talented run-blocking group. The net result ought to be a fantasy point production level much higher than his RB4 ADP.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if DeVonta Smith is a WR1.\n\nThe Eagles will still be a run-centric team this year, but head coach Nick Sirianni knows the value of going after favorable matchups. Philadelphia has a 91 score in my passing matchup points metric, which should cause Sirianni to throw more often this year. Smith, who has an 88 score in matchup points, will be a prime beneficiary. The Eagles\u2019 No. 2 receiver, who has a low-end WR2 ADP, could move to the low end or border of the WR1 tier.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Pat Freiermuth and Jonnu Smith split TE targets.\n\nThe addition of Jonnu Smith may move Freiermuth out of the slot TE role, but offensive coordinator Arthur Smith knows how to get the most out of a multiple TE personnel set. Freiermuth gives Smith plenty of reasons to incorporate him into the aerial attack. Freiermuth ranked eighth in vertical PPR PPG among tight ends last year and was tied for the second-highest catch rate at that route depth level, which is no anomaly. Freiermuth has excelled in impact plays in previous seasons. Freiermuth could move well above his low-end TE2 ADP with the possibility of split TE targets in Pittsburgh.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Ricky Pearsall is a WR2.\n\nPearsall got up to full speed late last season by posting 47.6 PPR points in Weeks 17-18. Kyle Shanahan likely sees that as a harbinger for what Pearsall can do in 2025. There will certainly be opportunities given that the San Francisco wide receiver corps will be short-handed to open the season. Blend that with Pearsall having a superb 94 matchup points (in my metric), and he could register a WR2-caliber point total this year.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Zach Charbonnet posts a second straight borderline RB2 season.\n\nThe Seahawks want Kenneth Walker to be a bell cow, but Walker has missed 10 games in his three NFL seasons, and Charbonnet has posted 318 scrimmage plays over the past two years. Charbonnet has been extremely productive as well. Last year, he ranked fourth in RB PPR PPG among running backs with 175 or more scrimmage plays. Charbonnet also split goal-line work with Walker last year and could do so again this year; Charbonnet could have another borderline RB2 season.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Bucky Irving finishes in the top five in RB scoring.\n\nIrving ranked seventh in RB PPR points in Weeks 10-18 last year despite having a bye in Week 11 and scoring only 2.8 PPR points in Week 14 due to an injury \u2014 largely due to Irving\u2019s breakaway ability. He ranked fifth in percentage of 10+ yard rushes last year among running backs with 200 more rushes. That\u2019s enough to push Irving into the RB1 tier, but when combined with Tampa Bay scoring 82 in rushing matchup points, Irving is a viable top-five RB in 2025.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Elic Ayomanor is a solid flex candidate.\n\nThe Titans need to maximize the value of every potential playmaker on this offense. Ayomanor can be one of those playmakers. He racked up 294 receiving yards in a 2023 game against Colorado despite frequently facing Travis Hunter in coverage. Ayomanor has reportedly been in sync with Cam Ward during training camp, so he could be incorporated into the Tennessee passing game very early on. It may be enough to make Ayomanor a solid flex candidate in deeper leagues.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Jacory Croskey-Merritt is an RB2.\n\nWashington wouldn\u2019t have traded away Brian Robinson Jr. if it didn\u2019t think Crosky-Merritt was ready for prime time. Croskey-Merritt has been showcasing his skills this preseason and has what The Beast 2025 NFL Draft Guide terms \u201cexplosive footwork to stop on a dime and redirect.\u201d JCM is apt to be in a platoon with Austin Ekeler, so he should have a work volume that could result in an RB2 valuation at season\u2019s end.",

      "text": "Talent valuation is on every fantasy manager\u2019s mind this time of year. The world of advanced metrics can offer ample assistance here, especially when identifying ADP values that are either much higher or much lower than they should be.\nTo assist fantasy managers with this effort, I have reviewed numerous advanced metrics to identify players whose ADP values either make them upside plays or risky propositions.\nAdvertisement\nI examine the player\u2019s aggregate ADP in PPR scoring (per Fantasy Pros), the round(s) the aggregate ADP places the player in, given a 12-team format, the round value I have for the player (The Football Scientist\u2019s 2025 Draft Guide) and the metric(s) that suggest why the aggregate ADP grades are higher or lower than they should be.\nLet\u2019s start with the undervalued players. The round value indicates how much value you will likely get from that player. Don\u2019t let that number override the ADP when making a pick because then the value proposition will disappear. For instance, if a player has an ADP in Rounds 4-5 and a round value of 3, you\u2019ll still want to try to select that player in the Rounds 4-5 window and thus maximize the upside value.\n(Note: The metrics detailed below are courtesy of TruMedia/PFF or Pro Football Reference/Stathead.)\nTop 5 undervalued players\nJameson Williams, WR, Detroit Lions\nAggregate ADP: 58\nAggregate ADP round: 4-5\nThe Football Scientist\u2019s round value: 3-4\nMetrics impacting his value: High yards per target\nFantasy managers had been waiting for Williams to showcase the skills he displayed in an incredible 2021 season at Alabama, and he finally did in 2024, posting 11.0 yards per target (third-highest among WRs with 75+ targets last season).\nLast year\u2019s performance has driven Williams\u2019 ADP much higher this draft season, but the ADP still hasn\u2019t caught up with Williams\u2019 potential in the Lions offense. Detroit\u2019s new offensive coordinator, John Morton, has indicated he wants to send even more passes in Williams\u2019 direction this season. Williams has shown he can shoulder a hefty workload, having notched 79 catches in that 2021 Crimson Tide campaign. If Williams does see a spike to the 70+ reception level and comes close to his 2024 per-play production pace, he will easily be worth a third-round pick.\nMark Andrews, TE, Baltimore Ravens\nAggregate ADP: 74\nAggregate ADP round: 6-7\nThe Football Scientist\u2019s round value: 4 or 5\nMetrics impacting his value: Red zone production, vertical PPR PPG\nAdvertisement\nFirst impressions are important because that\u2019s when people pay the most attention, which can help explain why Andrews is rated so low. His return from injury meant a terrible start last season. He posted 3.4 or fewer PPR points in three of the first four weeks, which made him a huge early-season disappointment to many fantasy managers, who haven\u2019t forgotten.\nBut these managers should remember that Andrews went on a roll once healthy. He racked up 14+ PPR points in all but three games in the rest of the 2024 season and ended up ranking fifth in TE non-PPR points and sixth in PPR points. Andrews also led the league in red zone touchdown receptions (leading all players, not just tight ends) and was second among tight ends in vertical PPR PPG (fantasy production on passes thrown 11+ air yards).\nWhen these latter elements are combined with Andrews being fully healthy to start this year and having the most favorable pass coverage schedule at this position, it should result in a fourth- or fifth-round ADP, yet Andrews will be available in Rounds 6-7 in most draft rooms.\nCaleb Williams, QB, Chicago Bears\nAggregate ADP: 116\nAggregate ADP round: 9-10\nThe Football Scientist\u2019s round value: 6\nMetrics impacting his value: Rush touchdowns, fireworks points\nWilliams ranked sixth in QB rush yards last season, yet ranked 14th in QB fantasy PPG on rushing plays. A lack of rushing touchdowns on 81 rush attempts is why he didn\u2019t finish higher. Williams is only the third quarterback in the Super Bowl era to post 75 or more rush attempts and score zero rushing touchdowns (Patrick Mahomes in 2023 and Robert Griffin III in 2013 being the other two).\nBen Johnson will utilize Williams\u2019 rushing skills, so the second-year QB will likely bounce back and secure some rushing touchdowns. That alone may be enough to warrant taking Williams earlier, but he also benefits from the Bears investing in the offensive line (after an abysmal 2024) and two potential impact rookies in Luther Burden III and Colston Loveland, who improve an already talented pass-catching corps. Combine that with an 84 (out of 100) mark in the fireworks points category (a metric of mine that measures how likely a team will get into high-scoring games), and you get sixth-round value for a player who will be on the board in Rounds 9-10 in most draft rooms.\nAdvertisement\nJordan Love, QB, Green Bay Packers\nAggregate ADP: 132\nAggregate ADP round: 11-12\nThe Football Scientist\u2019s round value: 6\nMetrics impacting his value: Rushing PPG\nLove was one of only four quarterbacks to rank in the top six in both vertical and stretch vertical fantasy PPG last season while dealing with injuries to his knee and groin \u2014 he can play through pain. Love could improve those long pass numbers if rookie speedster Matthew Golden hits the ground running.\nSpeaking of running, Love ranked 27th in QB run PPG, but again, he was injured. There are many reasons to think that Love will run the ball more this year, including OC Adam Stenavich\u2019s answer to the question: Would you like Love to run more this season?\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a huge weapon and Jordan has that ability to make some big plays down the field \u2026 we encourage that, for sure.\u201d\nGiven he runs more and improves on his No. 16 ranking in short PPG (a huge drop-off from his No. 5 ranking in this category in 2023), Love has two powerful fantasy upside avenues and can be drafted at or near the last round, despite Round 6 value.\nBuffalo D/ST\nAggregate ADP: 134\nAggregate ADP round: 12\nThe Football Scientist\u2019s round value: 10 or 11\nMetrics impacting his value: Pass-blocking matchup points\nA closer look at D/ST fantasy numbers shows that total pass rush impact (sacks, forced fumbles/scoop and scores on sacks, interceptions forced, etc.) accounts for about 50% of all fantasy points. The Bills already had a solid pass rush last year and have since added Joey Bosa and second-round draft pick Landon Jackson to bolster it.\nBuffalo also has one of the most favorable pass-blocking matchup point totals (my out-of-100 metric for measuring the overall strength of a pass-blocking schedule a D/ST is due to face) for the 2025 season.\nThe Bills\u2019 D/ST added plenty of other defensive talent and is coming off a season in which it led the league in turnover drive percentage. This blend will make Buffalo a go-to starter in many weeks and a value pick in most draft rooms.\nTop 5 overvalued ADPs\nTyreek Hill, WR, Miami Dolphins\nAggregate ADP: 29\nAggregate ADP round: 2-3\nThe Football Scientist\u2019s round value: 4\nMetrics impacting his value: Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s vertical pass numbers\nAdvertisement\nMiami head coach Mike McDaniel has a recurring quandary. He is, by nature, a very aggressive play caller and wants to attack defenses with vertical passes (aerials of 10+ air yards), yet he also has to protect injury-prone QB Tua Tagovailoa.\nLast season, Tagovailoa threw short very often (ranking fourth in fantasy PPG on short passes) rather than pushing the ball downfield (ranked No. 30 in vertical fantasy PPG). Since Tagovailoa\u2019s durability rating hasn\u2019t changed, there is a good chance that McDaniel will again scale back the Dolphins\u2019 long-pass ambitions.\nHill overcame a lack of aerial passes last season and still posted a No. 22 ranking among wide receivers in vertical PPR PPG and a No. 18 ranking in WR PPR points. That\u2019s worthy of a fourth-round pick, yet the aggregate ADP suggests that Hill will rebound to a borderline WR1 level. Plus, there are risks: If Tagovailoa gets hurt, Hill\u2019s value plummets, and McDaniel could lose his job if Miami struggles this season. The better percentage play is to expect a repeat of the 2024 campaign that generated fourth-round value for Hill.\nXavier Worthy, WR, Kansas City Chiefs\nAggregate ADP: 54\nAggregate ADP round: 4-5\nThe Football Scientist\u2019s round value: 7\nMetrics impacting his value: Vertical and stretch vertical PPR PPG\nHead coach Andy Reid has spoken at length this offseason about improving the Chiefs\u2019 vertical and stretch vertical (passes of 20+ air yards) production, which could, in theory, help Worthy. But let\u2019s consider the impediments.\nFirstly, Reid said the same thing about long pass improvement before last year, and it didn\u2019t pan out for Worthy. He ranked 60th in WR stretch vertical PPR PPG and 86th in vertical PPR PPG. Reid will certainly aim to change that, but he also has to consider that Worthy is the Chiefs\u2019 best short pass receiver, a top red zone threat and can generate 20 or so carries per season. And Worthy is only 165 pounds and has never posted more than 79 touches in a college or pro campaign.\nThere is a limit to how much Reid can lean on Worthy in the long pass area. Those aerials may instead end up going to Hollywood Brown and Rashee Rice. Worthy is still a very good Round 7 pick who can even be justified in Round 6 in some cases, but taking him in Rounds 4-5 is probably a reach.\nJake Ciely\u2019s take on Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy\nPhiladelphia D/ST\nAggregate ADP: 114\nAggregate ADP round: 9-10\nThe Football Scientist\u2019s round value: 12 or 13\nMetrics impacting his value: Multiple matchup categories\nAdvertisement\nThe first trait fantasy managers look for in a D/ST is matchup quality. It has so much influence that many fantasy managers build a D/ST rotation based on favorable matchups.\nAccording to my \u201cmatchup points\u201d metric, the Eagles\u2019 schedule is the second-most difficult among D/STs this season. Matchup points are out of 100, and the higher the points, the better.\nPhiladelphia\u2019s 2025 schedule is merciless from a D/ST perspective. The first five games are against Dallas, Kansas City, the Los Angeles Rams, Tampa Bay and Denver. Then, the schedule improves for a few weeks, but beginning in Week 10, the Eagles get Green Bay, Detroit, Dallas, Chicago, and the Los Angeles Chargers, followed by the Commanders in Week 16 and the Bills in Week 17. The only plus matchups on the schedule are the New York Giants in Weeks 6 and 8 and Las Vegas in Week 15.\nThis D/ST is talented and can post some solid fantasy point totals in tough games, but not enough to justify taking the Eagles D/ST in Rounds 9-10.\nJake Ferguson, TE, Dallas Cowboys\nAggregate ADP: 138\nAggregate ADP round: 11-12\nThe Football Scientist\u2019s round value: 14 or 15\nMetrics impacting his value: Red zone targets and schedule strength\nFerguson had a good stretch in Weeks 3-5 last year, but posted 6.2 or fewer points in the 10 games that followed. The reasons for this lack of production are myriad. Ferguson had only four red zone targets all year long. He was 36th in TE vertical PPR PPG, 35th in TE stretch vertical PPR PPG and had the second-lowest short-pass air-yards per target among tight ends with 50 or more short pass targets.\nThis offense will be much more run-heavy under Brian Schottenheimer. The Cowboys also added another potential impact pass catcher in George Pickens. Additionally, Ferguson faces nine red-rated TE coverage matchups this year (Dallas has the toughest TE coverage schedule in the 2025 season). There are more than enough reasons to bypass Ferguson in drafts.\nAdvertisement\nCam Ward, QB, Tennessee Titans\nAggregate ADP: 173\nAggregate ADP round: 14\nThe Football Scientist\u2019s round value: Do not draft\nMetrics impacting his value: Low fireworks points\nStudies I\u2019ve done over the years indicate that scoreboard shootouts (games where each team scores 24 or more points) generate roughly 60% of quarterback fantasy points, despite accounting for roughly one-third of the matchups.\nTennessee has the lowest QB fireworks points total (out of 100) in the 2025 season.\n| QB | Team | Points |\n|---|---|---|\nTEN | 1 | |\nIND | 9 | |\nSF | 18 | |\nLAC | 26 | |\nJAX | 26 | |\nLV | 26 | |\nBUF | 34 | |\nDEN | 34 | |\nNE | 34 | |\nHOU | 34 |\nThat is a major impediment for any quarterback, but doubly so for a rookie on a team that is somewhat talent-challenged at WR and TE. Head coach Brian Callahan will also want Ward to be careful with his throws following a season in which the Titans had the highest interception rate in the league. The situation in Tennessee and the lack of scoreboard-shootout potential don\u2019t inspire much faith in rostering Ward as a low-end QB2.\n(Photo of Jameson Williams: Gregory Shamus / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Many of last year\u2019s \u201cFree Guys\u201d were also in last year\u2019s Week 1 fantasy football waivers: Chuba Hubbard, J.K. Dobbins, Bucky Irving, Rico Dowdle, Jordan Mason, Darnell Mooney and Jerry Jeudy \u2014 even Khalil Shakir, Jakobi Meyers and more.\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201cmuwhahaha, I\u2019m the smartest man alive\u201d boast. There were plenty of waiver stashes who didn\u2019t hit, as well. I\u2019m merely pointing out that you shouldn\u2019t ignore potential value sitting on the waiver wire just because it\u2019s Week 1. Maximize your bench! Yes, you need a potential immediate starter or two, but you should be thinking about upside and breakouts.\nDo you have goose pimples? Are you having sleepless nights? The NFL is back!\nHEADS UP\n- Players must be under 60% rostered on Yahoo.\n- Listed in order of preference: I\u2019ll regularly prioritize potential upside over immediate replacement production.\n- RB backups have a separate secondary list based only on the lead option getting hurt.\n- No FAB suggestions: It varies wildly by league tendencies and is always relative (if you lost your RB1 to injury and there is a clear backup taking his role, you\u2019ll be more aggressive)\n- Streaming QBs and TEs are grouped. Once projections and ranks run, the weekly rankings can change, and DSTs could shift a bit, too.\n- Emojis for brevity:\n- \ud83d\ude0f = mentioned multiple times, multiple weeks \u2014 either you want him, or don\u2019t\n- \ud83e\udee1 = \u201cNext Man Up,\u201d but with deeper startability\nWORRY REPORT\n(Scale 1-5: more ducks = more worry)\n- Every week, starting in Week 2, I\u2019ll break down the biggest player concerns and determine whether the worry is warranted.\nPOWER UP PLAYERS\n(Scale 1-5: more Mario mushrooms = more excitement)\n- And every week, I\u2019ll touch on some of the biggest surprises and let you know if you should buy into the fun.\nSTREAMING QUARTERBACKS\n- Trevor Lawrence, JAX \u2014 The Panthers have a weak defense, and the Jaguars might not be better, meaning this could be a surprise shootout.\n- Bryce Young, CAR \u2014 QB1 potential\u2026 if he runs near the goal line as much as he did late last year.\n- Joe Flacco, CLE \u2014 Over 4,400 yards in his past 17 starts. Sneakiest gamble for a Top 10 finish.\n- Matthew Stafford, LAR \u2014 Always a threat for multiple touchdowns.\n- Tua Tagovailoa, MIA \u2014 As long as everyone is healthy, weekly Top 10 ceiling, albeit with a so-so floor.\n- Daniel Jones, IND \u2014 Rushing floor will always make Jones half-decent \u2014 even if that\u2019s what his passing ability is.\n- Michael Penix, ATL \u2014 If the Falcons can\u2019t stop Baker Mayfield and play aggressively to keep pace, Penix could be sneaky.\n- Geno Smith, LV \u2014 Solid, but likely better weeks to take a chance with Smith than against New England.\n- Cam Ward, TEN \u2014 Big arm. Big matchup problem.\n- Aaron Rodgers, PIT \u2014 Revenge? Meh. Still watching Rodgers feels like Montezuma\u2019s revenge.\n- Russell Wilson, NYG \u2014 Wilson has Nabers but limited fantasy appeal.\n- Sam Darnold, SEA \u2014 With how Darnold finished 2024, I\u2019d rather not risk him in Week 1.\n- Spencer Rattler, NO \u2014 Has yet to score 15 fantasy points.\nWAIVER WIRE RUNNING BACK RANKS\nNOTE: Everyone through Woody Marks has the potential for standalone value \u2014 even if in a timeshare. If you don\u2019t need that kind of value, my cutoff would be Bhayshul Tuten, and then I\u2019d dip into the pure handcuff options.\n- Ollie Gordon, MIA \u2014 Jaylen Wright is sidelined and looked awful this preseason. Gordon can be the Dolphins\u2019 version of David Montgomery.\n- Dylan Sampson, CLE \u2014 Quinshon Judkins still hasn\u2019t signed; Jerome Ford is quality but limited; and Sampson\u2019s role can remain productive no matter the situation. Sampson is like the Browns\u2019 version of Austin Ekeler. Until Judkins plays, Sampson is a timeshare piece with a nice burst and receiving upside. When Judkins is active, that won\u2019t change. In fact, Sampson has a chance to take the early lead and carry RB2 value.\n- Quinshon Judkins, CLE \u2014 I have no idea when he might play, but once Judkins is on the field, he\u2019ll have RB2 upside. He checks in before several timeshare pieces with potential immediate value. He\u2019s a longer-play gamble, but with one of the highest ceilings on the list.\n- Jerome Ford, CLE \u2014 Ford is solid, if not replaceable, but until Judkins is acclimated, Ford is a potential RB2/3. He\u2019s a solid grab for those needing early-season value. Just understand it could be limited value.\n- Najee Harris, LAC \u2014 Greg Roman loves using a second running back, and if Harris is 100%, he could have touchdown-reliant RB3 value. Plus, if Omarion Hampton gets hurt, Harris would be a rock-solid RB2.\n- Kyle Monangai, CHI \u2014 Monangai is another player with the potential to be another team\u2019s version of David Montgomery.\n- Rachaad White, TB \u2014 Just because Bucky Irving is amazing doesn\u2019t mean we ignore a potential RB3 in half- and full-PPR leagues, or worst case, a nice backup who would be an RB2 if Irving got hurt.\n- Chris Rodriguez, WSH \u2014 Jacory Croskey-Merritt is the favorite to lead, but don\u2019t forget that Ekeler will be consistently involved, and Rodriguez has upside and could surprise as the timeshare lead.\n- Jaydon Blue, DAL \u2014 Explosive. Receiving threat. Already banged up a few times, Blue has the ability for RB2 value if Javonte Williams is (still) toast.\n- Bhayshul Tuten, JAX \u2014 Also explosive. Upside to be the Jaguars\u2019 best fantasy option \u2014 albeit still in a timeshare.\n- Kareem Hunt, KC \u2014 Hunt could be the passing down option, an RB2/3 if Isiah Pacheco gets hurt again or one of your first drops.\n- Roschon Johnson, CHI \u2014 If it\u2019s not Monangai, maybe Johnson will finally play to expectations.\n- Kendre Miller, NO \u2014 Devin Neal may take the spot in time, but Miller is currently the No. 2 to Alvin Kamara.\n- Brashard Smith, KC \u2014 Potential for Jerick McKinnon-like role and value.\n- Kalel Mullings, TEN \u2014 With Tyjae Spears out, Mullings can use his power to be the next option behind Tony Pollard.\n- Woody Marks, HOU \u2014 Joe Mixon\u2019s season is a mystery. Nick Chubb is solid but not what he was years ago. Dameon Pierce has done little since his rookie year. Marks is a deep flier, but he has the burst and potential to be an RB2 and climb the ranks (like Tuten).\n- Tyjae Spears, TEN \u2014 The Titans got him involved late last year. Tony Pollard is good but not amazing, and Spears can be stashed in your IR as a \u201cbonus\u201d lotto ticket. He\u2019s only above the clear handcuffs because he should have a chance for standalone value once he\u2019s back.\n- Trey Benson, ARI \u2014 Benson has RB2+ value if James Conner misses time, and there is a chance the Cardinals could timeshare their backfield at this point in Conner\u2019s career.\n- Tyler Allgeier, ATL \u2014 Was a top-end RB2 before Bijan Robinson arrived and would be again if he\u2019s needed to replace Robinson.\n- Ray Davis, BUF \u2014 Davis has RB2 value if James Cook gets hurt.\n- DJ Giddens, IND \u2014 Jonathan Taylor has missed time each of the past three seasons, and Giddens would step in with RB2+ value.\n- Rico Dowdle, CAR \u2014 Limited ceiling but can be a mid-low RB2 if Chuba Hubbard is hurt.\n- Tahj Brooks, CIN \u2014 Chase Brown\u2019s replacement if anything happens.\n- Will Shipley, PHI \u2014 The Saquon Barkley backup. Enough said.\n- Dameon Pierce, HOU \u2014 Currently next up behind Chubb, and maybe he looks something like his rookie year. But there\u2019s also a good chance he\u2019s waiver fodder.\n- Blake Corum, LAR \u2014 I believe the Rams could timeshare Corum and Jarquez Hunter if Kyren Williams missed time, but it sounds like Corum would lead the way.\n- Chris Brooks, GB \u2014 Atop the backup depth chart behind Josh Jacobs, for now.\n- Jarquez Hunter, LAR \u2014 As mentioned, he could timeshare with Corum if Williams is out. Given Hunter\u2019s ability, it also wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if he led and not Corum.\nPURELY NEXT MAN UP RANKS\n(if an injury ahead of them)\n- Brian Robinson, SF (don\u2019t normally include over 60% but several asked)\n- Trey Benson, ARI\n- Tyler Allgeier, ATL\n- Najee Harris, LAC\n- Ollie Gordon, MIA\n- Tyjae Spears, TEN\n- Rachaad White, TB\n- Ray Davis, BUF\n- DJ Giddens, IND\n- Chris Rodriguez, WSH\n- Rico Dowdle, CAR\n- Tahj Brooks, CIN\n- Jaydon Blue, DAL\n- Will Shipley, PHI\n- Blake Corum, LAR\n- Kendre Miller, NO\n- Chris Brooks, GB\nWAIVER WIRE WIDE RECEIVER RANKS\nNOTE: Once you\u2019re through Legette, if you don\u2019t need potential early-season value, I\u2019d drop down to Jayden Higgins and others after him for a few pure-upside, lottery-ticket stashes.\n- Brandon Aiyuk, SF \u2014 I\u2019m assuming the only leagues where Aiyuk isn\u2019t stashed are ones without IR spots. Otherwise, Aiyuk\u2019s Top 20 potential needs to be on rosters.\n- Cedric Tillman, CLE \u2014 Terrific four-game stretch last year, and with Joe Flacco at quarterback, Tillman is in the WR4 boom/bust group.\n- Darnell Mooney, ATL \u2014 This one is weird. Raheem Morris said they hope to have Mooney \u2026 this year. And that was just a few weeks ago. Now, it sounds as though Mooney is a possibility for Week 1. If Mooney is healthy, he\u2019s a weekly boom/bust WR4 and a near must-start in 3-WR leagues.\n- Marvin Mims, DEN \u2014 Mims is one of many here in the \u201cFree Guys\u201d piece. Mims is the No. 2 and his upside brings WR4 potential similar to Mooney.\n- Joshua Palmer, BUF \u2014 Palmer is more than worth a roster stash if he\u2019s a top-two option over Keon Coleman.\n- Romeo Doubs, GB \u2014 Jayden Reed has a Jones fracture in his foot, which opens the doors for Doubs and his downfield upside to be a top-two option with Matthew Golden \u2026 hopefully, more consistently than in 2024.\n- Xavier Legette, CAR \u2014 Jalen Coker has a severe quad strain, which has him on the IR, clearing up the uncertainty around the No. 2 option alongside Tetairoa McMillan.\n- Christian Kirk, HOU \u2014 I believe in Jayden Higgins \u2014 more on him shortly \u2014 but if you have Aiyuk or Chris Godwin and need more immediate production than ceiling, Kirk is the pickup.\n- Keenan Allen, LAC \u2014 He might be one of the first waiver cuts, but Allen could rebound back in L.A. as Justin Herbert\u2019s No. 2.\n- DeMario Douglas, NE \u2014 With Stefon Diggs\u2019 health a question and the other wideouts failing to force their way into a starting role, Douglas has a shot to be a WR3/4 in half- and full-PPR.\n- Adam Thielen, MIN \u2014 Just like Kirk, Thielen is an early-season option, but he has a much more definitive \u201cend date\u201d with Jordan Addison back in Week 4.\n- Roman Wilson, PIT \u2014 Another \u201cFree Guys\u201d mention, as Wilson has every chance to be the No. 2 for the Steelers. Although there is risk, as I\u2019ll mention with his teammate below.\n- Amari Cooper, LV \u2014 Raiders\u2019 version of Keenan Allen.\n- Hollywood Brown, KC \u2014 With Rashee Rice suspended, Brown has the chance for boom/bust value, and you know managers will overreact if he has a huge Week 1.\n- Tyler Lockett, TEN \u2014 Sure, he looked donezo last year, but Cam Ward is talented enough to make more than Calvin Ridley useful.\n- Rashod Bateman, BAL \u2014 I hear people say that Bateman is a great WR5. I disagree. You never, ever, evvvverrrrr know when to play Bateman unless DeAndre Hopkins is a non-factor and Lamar Jackson throws 41 touchdowns again. Truthfully, Mooney and Bateman were a Spider-Man-pointing GIF last year. However, Hopkins just adds another possibility to Bateman hitting those 2-to-4-point floors more often.\n- Jayden Higgins, HOU \u2014 If he\u2019s Marvin Jones, who is my comp, Higgins can be a WR3 in fantasy. It may take a few weeks, but I\u2019d stash that potential anywhere I could.\n- Isaac TeSlaa, DET \u2014 In my \u201cFree Guys\u201d column and more than worth your attention if something happened to Amon-Ra St. Brown or Jameson Williams.\n- Calvin Austin, PIT \u2014 Austin averaged over 15 YPR last year and has some intrigue, but Wilson has the higher ceiling and more complete wideout profile. However, if Wilson doesn\u2019t lock in the No. 2 role and Austin has it, there would be WR5 value here.\n- Elic Ayomanor, TEN \u2014 Lots of \u201cFree Guys\u201d here. Back to Lockett. If he is done, then Ayomanor can step up as the No. 2 and be a surprise WR4 in his rookie year.\n- Tory Horton, SEA \u2014 If Cooper Kupp doesn\u2019t return to form or misses time (again), Horton has WR4 potential as the No. 2 for Sam Darnold.\n- Tre Harris, LAC \u2014 Harris is a long-term stash. If Allen doesn\u2019t rebound, Harris can step into the No. 2 role.\n- Dont\u2019e Thornton, LV \u2014 Big play waiting to happen (over 25 YPR final year in college). Stash where you can in case he gets a top-two role either via his play and Cooper being washed or a Jakobi Meyers trade during the season.\n- Luther Burden, CHI \u2014 Long-term stash, and he may not hit until 2026 \u2014 like Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Rome Odunze in their rookie seasons.\n- Wan\u2019Dale Robinson, NYG \u2014 Even in full-PPR, I don\u2019t value Robinson too highly unless you want a floor WR4. After all, he was just WR46 in FPPG on 140 targets.\n- Alec Pierce, IND \u2014 You know he has downfield ability, but Pierce is a stash while Michael Pittman is healthy and until Anthony Richardson is the quarterback.\n- Darius Slayton, NYG \u2014 Never know when to start him \u2014 well, basically never given his two double-digit games last year \u2014 but if Slayton ends up the No. 2 and pushes Robinson into obscurity, there is deeper league value.\n- Pat Bryant, DEN \u2014 Fits the big slot role for Sean Payton\u2019s offense, but needs to develop to move up the depth chart.\nSTREAMING TIGHT ENDS\n- Hunter Henry, NE \u2014 With the Patriots\u2019 receiving corps still in flux, Henry is a decent half- and full-PPR play.\n- Zach Ertz, WSH \u2014 If you want to make sure you don\u2019t get skunked.\n- Brenton Strange, JAX \u2014 In a Henry-type situation, especially if Travis Hunter doesn\u2019t come out of the gate strong.\n- Darren Waller, MIA \u2014 The week\u2019s biggest boom/bust play.\n- Mason Taylor, NYJ \u2014 Upside and the ability to be the second-best receiving option for the Jets.\n- Jonnu Smith, PIT \u2014 Who knows if Smith will see enough work to be startable, but similar to Henry and Taylor, he could be the second option.\n- Theo Johnson, NYG \u2014 Athletic matchup problem\u2026 if the Giants utilize him.\n- Ja\u2019Tavion Sanders, CAR \u2014 Another major matchup problem, and with Thielen gone and Coker out, Sanders could see decent work.\nSTREAMING DSTs\n(first team is streamer)\nWeek 1\n- ARI at NO\n- CIN at CLE\n- LAR vs HOU\n- SF at SEA\n- CHI vs MIN\n- NYJ vs PIT\n- WSH vs NYG\n- GB vs DET\n- NE vs LV\nWeek 2\n- SF at NO\n- ARI vs CAR\n- LAR at TEN\n- SEA at PIT\n- LAC at LV\n- GB vs WSH\n(Photo of Cedric Tillman: Jason Miller / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Every year, the quarterback position becomes more important in fantasy football. Last season, 12 quarterbacks scored 282 or more fantasy points, marking the fourth time in the past five seasons that 10 or more quarterbacks reached 282+ points. While a longer schedule contributes to some of the increase in scoring, before 2018, there was only one season with 10+ QBs reaching 282 points, and no other season with seven or more QBs at that scoring level \u2014 so, there\u2019s more to the increase than one additional game.\nAdvertisement\nThis scoring largesse means fantasy managers must get the most out of the quarterback position. For the second consecutive season, I\u2019m providing The Athletic\u2019s readers access to my annual deep dive write-ups on QBs. I have been writing these for my fantasy football draft guide for the past 22 seasons (the 2025 edition can be found here).\nThe downloadable chart below provides quarterback grades, described here:\nThere are also matchup points, fireworks points and pass rush points totals for each player. Matchup points show expectations for how favorable or unfavorable the overall opposing pass coverage will be in 2025. Fireworks points indicate how likely the quarterback\u2019s team will get into high-scoring games this year. The pass rush points total shows the relative amount of pass rush pressure the quarterback is slated to face this year.\nAll three are graded on a 1 to 100 scale, with 100 being most beneficial to the quarterback.\nThe chart concludes with a suggested draft round and auction dollar value for each player ($200 format). The draft round is based on 12-team leagues with only one starting quarterback and will need to be adjusted for fantasy managers in 2QB or SuperFlex leagues.\nThe write-ups also sometimes include references to a color-coded system regarding individual matchups, which detail whether a player has a high volume of green-rated (favorable) or red-rated (unfavorable) matchups on the 2025 schedule. For example, Patrick Mahomes has five green-rated fireworks matchups in Weeks 1-9, meaning five contests in that span could turn into scoreboard shootouts.\nFinally, the draft strategy is based on consensus ADPs at FantasyPros.\nNow that the preliminaries are out of the way, let\u2019s dive into a synopsis of the top 25 quarterbacks!\n1. Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills\nUpside: Allen is on arguably the greatest quarterback scoring streak in NFL history. He has finished first or second in QB fantasy scoring in each of the past five years, which has happened only once before (Aaron Rodgers in 2008-12). That Allen finished ninth in the league in red zone rushing touchdowns despite placing second on his team illustrates the potential of Buffalo\u2019s potent offense. He finished first on the team in rushing touchdowns inside the 5-yard line, so his goal-line talents are still highly utilized. While Allen\u2019s rushing prowess helps his fantasy numbers, he also finished eighth in red zone touchdown passes, eighth in short-pass fantasy points per game (FPPG) and eighth in passing FPPG. He had only eight giveaways last year, protecting the ball as well as any quarterback, and Buffalo returns all five offensive line starters.\nAdvertisement\nDownside: Allen\u2019s production is far too reliant on short passes and rushing. He placed 17th in vertical pass FPPG and 25th in stretch-vertical FPPG. James Cook led the team in rushes inside the 10- and 5-yard lines, indicating Buffalo doesn\u2019t want Allen to continue to take the wear and tear of those hits. The Bills could also rely more on 220-pound Ray Davis for goal-line rushes. The receiving corps is similar to last year\u2019s pass-catching group, so Allen won\u2019t have new personnel to help with those subpar aerial numbers. The low fireworks points total suggests high-scoring games could be at a minimum this year.\nOverall: There isn\u2019t a more consistent elite player at any position in fantasy football. That is more than enough to tie Allen with Lamar Jackson for the top spot on the QB draft board.\nDraft strategy: He will be a mid- to late-second round pick in most draft rooms.\n2. Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens\nUpside: Jackson was the best fantasy QB last year, ranking first in overall fantasy points and FPPG. His FPPG total was over 3 points higher than second place. Jackson is no longer heavily reliant on rush production. He finished second in pass FPPG, sixth in short-pass FPPG, first in vertical FPPG and seventh in stretch-vertical FPPG. Jackson led the league in red zone touchdown passes even with Derrick Henry in the backfield. Nine Baltimore players caught at least one red zone touchdown pass in 2024, so this pass-centric red zone approach is by design and not happenstance. The Ravens return four offensive line starters. Baltimore has a high passing matchup points total versus a middling rush matchup points mark, so there is a matchup lean to throw the ball this season.\nDownside: Jackson\u2019s fantasy scoring track record isn\u2019t as strong as generally thought. Last year was only the second time Jackson has finished as the top-scoring QB, and the first time was a half-decade ago (2019). His highest season-ending rank outside of that was fourth in 2023, and Jackson never placed higher than ninth in any other season. Part of this is due to durability, as Jackson missed five games in the 2021 and 2022 campaigns. His passing production is currently a one-year trend. He was 15th in pass FPPG in 2023. Those aerial numbers could regress with defenses having a full offseason to adjust. Jackson had zero rushes inside the 5-yard line, so Baltimore looks to have taken him out of the rush offense on goal-line plays. That\u2019s why he was sixth in QB rush FPPG despite leading his position in rush yards.\nAdvertisement\nOverall: Jackson is tied with Josh Allen for the top fantasy quarterback honor this year.\nDraft strategy: He\u2019s worthy of a second-round pick, but going any higher than that is ill-advised given the potential for even a marginal scoring downgrade.\n3. Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles\nUpside: Hurts makes leading all quarterbacks in rushing points look easy. He did it in the 2024 season for the third time in four years (and he finished second in the other season). He achieves this mainly due to goal-line success. Hurts led the Eagles in carries inside the 5-yard line and tied for second in the league in that category. The tush push is still a legal play, so look for new offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo to use it as often as possible. The combination of A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith could allow Hurts to improve upon his No. 25 rank in passing FPPG if head coach Nick Sirianni and Patullo decide to throw more to take advantage of a really favorable matchup points total.\nDownside: His league-leading quarterback rush point total usually leads Hurts to a top-three overall ranking, but last year it resulted in an eighth-place finish in QB points. Part of the lower finish was due to missed time, but Hurts throwing only 361 passes was another key factor. Low passing volume directly resulted from Saquon Barkley being the offense\u2019s focal point. Since Barkley wants a second straight season with 2,000+ rushing yards, Hurts may find throwing much more than 400-450 passes challenging. Hurts has played in 15 games in three of the past four years, indicating he\u2019s apt to miss a game here or there. Losing OC Kellen Moore could be a huge play-calling downgrade. The pass rush schedule points total is the lowest in the category.\nOverall: Hurts doesn\u2019t throw often enough to contend for the top quarterback spot, but he does rush enough to earn a place in the top three.\nDraft strategy: Since quarterbacks typically don\u2019t start getting selected until the end of Round 2, Hurts should be on most draft boards in Round 4.\n4. Joe Burrow, Cincinnati Bengals\nUpside: No team gets more utilization out of its best player than the Bengals, which is how Burrow led all QBs in pass FPPG, short-pass FPPG, red zone targets and inside-the-10 targets in 2024. He insisted that Cincinnati\u2019s frugal ownership pony up the cash to keep Ja\u2019Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, so Burrow still has the best 1-2 wide receiver combination in the NFL. The Bengals had to pass as often as they did last year in large part because their defense was beyond atrocious, and it may not be much better this season, so Burrow may once again have to try to win plenty of shootouts. Burrow consistently adds a reasonable number of fantasy points on the ground.\nAdvertisement\nDownside: HC Zac Taylor knows that shootouts are 50/50 propositions, at best, even when a team has the caliber of offense Cincinnati has. That\u2019s why Taylor hired DC Al Golden, whose primary goal will be to limit the number of high-scoring games the Bengals have this year. That dovetails nicely with a midrange fireworks points total and a schedule with only two red-rated fireworks matchups in Weeks 1-12. Burrow has dealt with myriad injuries in his college and pro careers, so he has a low rushing production ceiling and had only three carries inside the 5-yard line last year.\nOverall: Cincinnati had to lean on Burrow quite heavily last year, and he responded with a lights-out performance, yet it only resulted in a No. 3 ranking in QB points. The Bengals\u2019 defensive changes should result in a marginal reduction in production, which moves Burrow just outside of the top three at his position.\nDraft strategy: The fantasy community knows a great passer who doesn\u2019t run the ball will usually rate behind superb dual-threat quarterbacks, so Burrow will be generally (and properly) valued as a third-round pick in most draft rooms. While I have him behind Hurts, his ADP on FantasyPros puts him ahead of Hurts, which is why I have Burrow going in Round 3, while I suggest taking Hurts in Round 4.\n5. Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders\nUpside: Winning the Offensive Rookie of the Year award is impressive, but don\u2019t forget that Daniels was also one of the NFL MVP front-runners for a good portion of last season. He scored as many rushing FPPG as Josh Allen despite having half as many rushing touchdowns. Daniels should have better passing numbers this season with the addition of Deebo Samuel and what may be the most improved offensive line personnel in the league. Daniels had nearly as many goal-line carries (10) as team leader Brian Robinson (11). Those resulted in only four scores, which could increase this year. Daniels and the Washington coaching staff are working hard to increase Daniels\u2019 playbook capabilities beyond his rookie season limitations.\nDownside: Daniels wasn\u2019t very productive on long passes last year. He ranked 21st in vertical FPPG and 20th in stretch-vertical FPPG. Samuel was 46th in stretch-vertical PPR PPG and 71st in vertical PPR PPG last year. He must improve in both departments to help Daniels reach new FPPG heights on those distant aerials. There is little quality receiving depth behind Samuel and Terry McLaurin. If Samuel doesn\u2019t pan out and McLaurin misses any time due to injury, Daniels\u2019 pass production could be hamstrung by what would be one of the worst pass-catching groups, and all of the schedule elements appear unfavorable.\nOverall: Daniels scored 355.8 points last year. It was the 34th time a quarterback has reached that point total. Only three quarterbacks have tallied back-to-back seasons of that nature. Unfortunately for Daniels, those three are Josh Allen (2020-24), Jalen Hurts (2022-23) and Patrick Mahomes (2020-22). Add in Joe Burrow (372.8 points last year), and at least four other quarterbacks can reach or top that point total. That\u2019s why, even though this year\u2019s projection has Daniels posting a campaign equal to 2024, he\u2019s only my QB5 in fantasy.\nDraft strategy: Daniels won\u2019t make it past the third round in nearly all drafts.\n6. Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs\nUpside: Mahomes started slow last season, but turned things around in Week 8 with an 18.18-point performance. That was the beginning of a stretch that ended with Mahomes ranking eighth in QB FPPG from Weeks 8-17 and finishing less than 3 points away from a top-six showing. With Hollywood Brown (coming back from injury), Xavier Worthy and Rashee Rice (who played in only four games last year and will likely face a suspension due to his involvement in a 2024 vehicle accident), the Chiefs have the talent to upgrade their subpar vertical passing production significantly. Kansas City has shored up its offensive line to emphasize downfield passing. Mahomes is extraordinarily durable, having missed only two games in seven seasons. There are five green-rated fireworks matchups in Weeks 1-9.\nAdvertisement\nDownside: The Chiefs\u2019 downfield passing attack needs more than a nominal upgrade, given the dismal long pass numbers this offense posted. Mahomes ranked 27th in vertical FPPG and 28th in stretch-vertical FPPG in 2024 \u2014 the second consecutive season Mahomes posted horrible numbers on downfield throws. Andy Reid worked just as hard to fix the problem then as now. Travis Kelce\u2019s regression isn\u2019t helping, nor is the consistent lack of quality pass blocking at offensive tackle. Rice is all but certain to be suspended for two to six games. Mahomes has one of the most difficult schedules from pass rush and pass coverage perspectives.\nOverall: Mahomes may no longer contend for the top overall fantasy QB spot, but he still has a well-defined path to be a top-six fantasy quarterback.\nDraft strategy: Fantasy managers who want upper-tier production without paying the draft premium for one of the top five quarterbacks should look to draft Mahomes in Round 5.\n7. Jared Goff, Detroit Lions\nUpside: Goff proves that a fantasy quarterback doesn\u2019t need a huge pass volume to produce strong fantasy numbers. He was third in pass FPPG, second in short-pass FPPG and in the top 10 in vertical and stretch-vertical FPPG \u2014 which led to a career high No. 6 ranking in QB points. This year, he could have an even higher ceiling. New OC John Morton may be more aggressive with the vertical passing game than Ben Johnson. Morton has indicated he will send as many long passes as possible to Jameson Williams, who Morton said is in line for a breakout season. Goff has missed only six games in the past eight seasons. The combined total of matchup and fireworks points is the highest at his position.\nDownside: Will Morton be a play-calling downgrade from Johnson? Any decline here could have a notable impact, given the relatively low pass volume. Goff has thrown 12+ interceptions in five of the past seven seasons. He adds almost nothing via the ground, with only four quarterbacks having a lower rush FPPG mark in 2024. The Lions saw the downside of shootouts late last year, so HC Dan Campbell may decide to be judicious in passing aggressiveness to prevent them. Center Frank Ragnow\u2019s retirement and the low pass rush points could be a hindrance.\nOverall: Goff was a mid-tier QB1 last year, without Williams\u2019s potential full breakout season. Factor in the general green light of a schedule, and Goff should have another mid-tier QB1 point total.\nDraft strategy: Goff could generate one of the best returns on investment at quarterback. He\u2019ll be available as a Round 7-8 pick and should generate at least fifth-round value.\nAdvertisement\n8. Caleb Williams, Chicago Bears\nUpside: Williams displayed his dual-threat skills on many occasions last year. He rushed for just short of 500 yards, which played into his ranking tied for eighth among QBs in games of 22+ points. Surprisingly, he did not record a rushing touchdown, so the yards led to a middling No. 14 ranking in rush FPPG, which Williams should easily be able to top this season. The Bears\u2019 offense ought to be much better with HC Ben Johnson calling plays. Chicago made multiple investments to upgrade their abysmal offensive line and added rookies Luther Burden and Colston Loveland to the passing game. Being in the NFC North leads to a high fireworks points total.\nDownside: The head coach change means another adjustment to a new system. The Lions were third in rush attempts and 16th in pass attempts last season. That\u2019s Johnson\u2019s run/pass ratio goal, so this won\u2019t be a pass-centric offense. There were times when Williams seemed to play it safe last year, which led to his throwing only six picks, thus preventing an issue where he forced passes into coverage like in college, but it is also why Williams had seven games with fewer than 10 points in 2024. If he is more aggressive on throws this year, it could result in more picks.\nOverall: The combination of the coaching change and personnel upgrades should give Williams at least as many big games as last year and reduce the number of single-digit scores. These paths to additional points project Williams to move into the middle of the QB1 tier.\nDraft strategy: Williams is the perfect prospect for fantasy managers looking for a relatively low-cost quarterback with the potential for 300+ points. That value proposition justifies a pick in Round 7, yet you may be able to draft Williams as late as Round 9.\n9. Baker Mayfield, Tampa Bay Buccaneers\nUpside: Mayfield proved that his 2023 QB1 performance was no fluke. He ranked fourth in overall FPPG, fourth in pass FPPG, third in short-pass FPPG and ninth in vertical pass FPPG. Tampa Bay returns every offensive starter from last year, and it added another aerial weapon in Ohio State wide receiver Emeka Egbuka. Mayfield didn\u2019t skip a beat despite a change in offensive coordinators last season, so the move to new OC Josh Grizzard (the Buccaneers\u2019 pass game coordinator in 2024) should be smooth. Mayfield isn\u2019t an impact rusher, but he was one of only 12 quarterbacks to average 3+ FPPG on the ground. The pass rush schedule is a cakewalk. There are eight green-rated matchups all year, including four straight in Weeks 14-17, and only one red-rated matchup.\nDownside: Tampa Bay\u2019s offense will likely be an All-Pro short to start the season. Left tackle Tristan Wirfs had late offseason knee surgery and is slated to begin the year on the PUP list. Mayfield and Lamar Jackson were the only quarterbacks with two streaks of four or more games with 20+ points. Since Jackson has done that five times in his career, and these were Mayfield\u2019s only ones, the Bucs\u2019 QB is a regression candidate. The 373-rush yard total he posted last year was more than double his previous single-season high, suggesting a drop-off is coming.\nOverall: There is a lot to like here, but that\u2019s not enough to dissipate the cloud of regression uncertainty. Even so, Mayfield should have a high floor that keeps him near the middle of the QB1 tier.\nAdvertisement\nDraft strategy: Mayfield will be a popular pick in Rounds 4-5 but should be selected in Rounds 7-8.\n10. Kyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals\nUpside: Murray has a strong track record of solid or better production in many areas. Last year, he was sixth in rush FPPG, 13th in short-pass FPPG, and 12th in overall FPPG. The addition of Marvin Harrison led to a notable improvement in Murray\u2019s vertical FPPG. Murray was ninth in pass attempts inside the 10-yard line, which indicates OC Drew Petzing trusts Murray to throw in that area of the field. Harrison and Trey McBride give Murray one of the league\u2019s top WR/TE combinations. Murray is now two years removed from knee surgery and may get back to his former top-flight rushing form. He also has one of the most favorable matchup points totals at his position.\nDownside: The vertical pass improvement with Harrison\u2019s addition was relative. Murray went from dead last in vertical FPPG in 2022 and 2023 to 26th in 2024. Murray also had the fifth-lowest stretch-vertical FPPG mark. Last year was only the third time in six NFL seasons Murray played in every game. Arizona has a new offensive line coach in his first year as an NFL coach at any level, and the Cardinals have two new offensive line starters. Murray\u2019s rush production includes almost no goal-line carries (only one in 2024). The Cardinals may not want to risk injury with those types of rushes. Arizona has seven red-rated vertical pass defense matchups in an eight-game span from Weeks 3-11. The Cardinals have a very favorable rush defense schedule that could put a low ceiling on the team\u2019s pass attempts.\nOverall: Murray has been a QB1 on four occasions but ranked higher than eighth in only one of those campaigns (third in 2020). There is enough to suggest that Murray has QB1 value in 2025, but he also has the same limited ceiling as his historical trends indicate. Add it up and he\u2019s a low-end QB1.\nDraft strategy: Murray\u2019s value level is well known, so he\u2019ll move off draft boards sometime in Rounds 7-9.\n11. Bo Nix, Denver Broncos\nUpside: It took a few weeks for the world to see what Sean Payton saw in Nix, but by the end of the year, it was clear that Nix is a franchise quarterback. Fantasy managers also saw this, with Nix finishing between seventh and ninth in overall, pass, rush and short-pass FPPG. Nix was superb in the red zone, placing tied for fifth in touchdown passes despite ranking 11th in red zone pass attempts. Denver returns all five starting offensive linemen, a group that ranked second in pass pressure rate allowed last year. The improvements to the ground game should augment the Broncos\u2019 passing prowess. Payton will get very creative with Evan Engram\u2019s usage in this offense, thus providing Nix with a potential matchup advantage on many occasions.\nDownside: The receiving corps outside of Courtland Sutton and Engram is unproven. Relying too heavily on those two could be a big issue if Engram has another injury-shortened season. Denver\u2019s rushing attack is a work in progress. Most of Nix\u2019s rushing production occurred on scramble plays, so defenses that spy him can limit his rushing yardage total, which is partially why Nix rushed for fewer than 10 yards on seven occasions last year. The three matchup categories don\u2019t offer much in terms of upside potential.\nAdvertisement\nOverall: Nix has proven he is capable of QB1 production. The issue is that the competition at the QB position is incredibly fierce, and Nix has downside elements that hurt his relative value. Rate him as a reliable low-end QB1.\nDraft strategy: He\u2019s a seventh- or eighth-round value who will go earlier than that in many drafts.\n12. Brock Purdy, San Francisco 49ers\nUpside: Purdy didn\u2019t quite live up to the excellence of the 2023 season, where he led the league in eight standard or advanced metric categories, but he still achieved some success. He was a top 11 quarterback in total FPPG, rush FPPG and vertical FPPG. To do that in a season where the 49ers\u2019 offense dealt with major injuries is a testament to Purdy\u2019s talents. Getting Christian McCaffrey back at full strength (as early reports indicate) is a massive upgrade for this offense. The re-signing of George Kittle keeps the 49ers\u2019 pass-catching talent at a very high level. The matchup points total is unmatched.\nDownside: The past two years make it clear that Purdy will be hard-pressed to obtain 500 pass attempts in this offense. The same players injured last year have durability concerns that could lead to missed time this year (Brandon Aiyuk could start the season on the PUP list). The offensive line depth is lacking, so any injury could hamper this group. Purdy is one of the most interception-prone quarterbacks in the NFL. Outside of Aiyuk, the wide receivers are talented yet inconsistent. There is only one green-rated fireworks matchup all season long.\nOverall: When everything went well for Purdy in 2023, he ended up with a No. 6 ranking. When things didn\u2019t go so well for the 49ers in 2024, Purdy ranked 13th. This year\u2019s ranking splits the difference and places him at the border of the QB1/QB2 level.\nDraft strategy: The tail end of QB1s come off draft boards in Round 8.\n13. Jordan Love, Green Bay Packers\nUpside: Love was one of only four QBs in the top six in vertical and stretch-vertical FPPG last year. He did this despite suffering through injuries to his knee and groin, which speaks well to his grit. The Packers\u2019 long passing could be even better this year with the addition of first-round speedster Matthew Golden. Green Bay already had the deepest roster of WR/TE talent before drafting Golden and third-round wideout Savion Williams. A healthy Love should vastly improve upon last year\u2019s dismal No. 27 ranking in QB run FPPG and a No. 16 ranking in short-pass FPPG. The vaulted matchup and fireworks points totals augur for the Packers to have many high-scoring games this year.\nAdvertisement\nDownside: The free-agent signing of 325-pound Aaron Banks and drafting of 335-pound Anthony Belton show the Packers are building an offensive line to avoid those high-scoring games. A greater emphasis on power rushing could reduce Love\u2019s short-yardage passing chances, making improving upon a No. 18 ranking for passes inside the 10 more difficult. Green Bay may scale back Love\u2019s rushing ambitions to preserve his health. He\u2019s thrown 22 interceptions the past two seasons. There are five red-rated pass rush matchups on the 2025 schedule.\nOverall: These elements don\u2019t suggest Love will return to his No. 5 ranking from the 2023 season. However, they indicate a likely improvement over last year\u2019s No. 17 rankings in both FPPG and overall QB points, earning Love a low-end QB1 rating.\nDraft strategy: The fantasy community is viewing Love through a 2024 prism and thus predicting another mid-tier QB2 showing, which doesn\u2019t match his low-end QB1 ranking here, so Love can be an excellent value pick in Rounds 9-10.\n14. Dak Prescott, Dallas Cowboys\nUpside: Prescott has a track record of fantasy scoring success, having finished in the top 10 in QB scoring in three of the past six seasons. He\u2019s only one season removed from arguably the best passing campaign of his career. The combination of CeeDee Lamb, George Pickens and Jake Ferguson gives the Cowboys one of the best starting WR/TE trios in the business. The improvements in the running game should help take some coverage pressure away. HC Brian Schottenheimer indicates the Dallas offense will have a lot more motion, shifts and play-action plays, all of which can help Prescott\u2019s per-play production.\nDownside: Schottenheimer\u2019s dad was a run-first coach. Schottenheimer\u2019s mentor (Pete Carroll) was a run-first coach. Schottenheimer\u2019s OC (Klayton Adams) has a run-centric background. Combine that with Jerry Jones noting that Schottenheimer bit his lip regarding the Cowboys\u2019 pass-centric approach under Mike McCarthy and Dallas revamping its entire RB corps, and it overwhelmingly suggests this will be a ground-based offense. Prescott had mediocre FPPG totals in overall passing, short passing and the run game last year. Prescott has missed 26 games due to injury over the past five years, and the schedule is largely unfavorable.\nOverall: The Dallas management and coaching staff are wise to use a run-first approach to maximize Prescott\u2019s production while limiting his wear and tear. That\u2019s great for the team, but not fantasy managers. It drops Prescott to the high end of the QB2 tier.\nDraft strategy: Prescott is a prime candidate to be drafted above his projected fantasy value. He should be selected in Rounds 9-10, but will be selected earlier quite often.\nAdvertisement\n15. Justin Fields, New York Jets\nUpside: Fields is one of the best rushing quarterbacks in fantasy football. Consider that his 8.9 rush FPPG mark would have ranked second at QB had he posted enough games to be listed as a qualifier. The Jets will be one of the most run-heavy teams in the NFL this year. RPOs will be a big part of that, so Fields could end up with a lot of carries this year. There is even talk that New York will use Fields on the tush push play, which could result in a spike in rushing touchdowns. Garrett Wilson and rookie Mason Taylor will provide maximum production on as many as half of Fields\u2019 pass attempts. Only one quarterback has a higher matchup points total.\nDownside: He couldn\u2019t keep the Pittsburgh starting job because his passing prowess is unacceptable. Fields would have ranked 29th in short-pass FPPG, 30th in vertical FPPG and 34th in stretch-vertical FPPG had he played enough games to qualify. It\u2019s not as if Pittsburgh had terrible downfield targets, because Russell Wilson ranked in the top four in vertical and stretch-vertical FPPG after replacing Fields. The Jets\u2019 new offensive coordinator, Tanner Engstrand, is in his first year as an NFL OC. New York\u2019s offensive line can run block, but it leaves something to be desired in pass blocking. The receiving corps behind Wilson and Taylor is mediocre or worse.\nOverall: When a quarterback can post nearly 9 fantasy points per game on the ground, he doesn\u2019t need much passing production to be a QB1. Fields\u2019 aerial talents don\u2019t quite get him to that level, but he\u2019s just a step or so behind it.\nDraft strategy: The QB1 class and top of the QB2 class won\u2019t be cleared off draft boards until at least Round 9. Consider taking Fields at any point after that.\n16. J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings\nUpside: Michigan has had its share of quality quarterbacks (including Tom Brady) over the years. Keep that in mind when noting McCarthy is the Wolverines\u2019 career leader in interception rate, completion percentage, pass efficiency and TD-to-INT ratio. HC Kevin O\u2019Connell knows how to build game plans to get the most out of his quarterback\u2019s talents. The Vikings may have the most improved offensive line in the league. Few, if any, teams have a receiving trio the equal of Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson. McCarthy showcased some planned rush and scramble ability at Michigan, both of which will be needed in Minnesota. No team has a better fireworks point total, with nearly half of the season comprising green-rated matchups.\nDownside: He\u2019s essentially a rookie starter. The upgraded offensive line could be used for run blocking, considering that Minnesota now has the makings of a platoon backfield with Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason. O\u2019Connell may also decide to rely on the run to help avoid what could be a considerable amount of scoreboard shootouts versus those high-octane offenses. Considering the entire interior was revamped, the offensive line could take some time to gel. Addison could end up missing time due to a possible suspension.\nOverall: A Minnesota quarterback has finished in the top nine in QB points in two of the past three seasons (Sam Darnold ranked ninth in 2024; Kirk Cousins ranked eighth in 2022). Since those were veterans and McCarthy is a first-year starter, this projection doesn\u2019t quite generate QB1 value, but McCarthy is just outside that tier.\nAdvertisement\nDraft strategy: McCarthy could be one of the best QB value picks. He\u2019s apt to post borderline QB1 value for what should be a Round 10-11 draft pick.\n18. Drake Maye, New England Patriots\nUpside: He didn\u2019t get on the field much until Week 6 last year, but after that, Maye showed why he was the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. Maye ranked 13th in FPPG in Weeks 6-17 and was only 27 points away from a top-10 finish in that time frame, and he did it with a lousy offense. New England tried to make improvements this offseason. The Patriots added rookies TreVeyon Henderson and Kyle Williams, veteran receivers Stefon Diggs and Mack Hollins, and a ton of offensive line talent (including a great left tackle in rookie Will Campbell). Last year\u2019s numbers show Maye can rush for over 500 yards in a full season. Josh McDaniels returning as OC is an upgrade, and the schedule is generally helpful.\nDownside: Maye had some of the worst fantasy passing numbers in 2024. He ranked 27th in short-pass FPPG, 32nd in vertical FPPG and 23rd in stretch-vertical FPPG. Diggs is coming off an injury and has already had a notable off-field issue. Williams is a rookie, and Hollins has caught more than 31 passes only once in seven NFL seasons. The offensive line could be in flux early on, given the personnel overhaul. HC Mike Vrabel\u2019s Tennessee teams finished higher than 30th in pass attempts once \u2014 and even then, it was 25th. This team could go the run-heavy route with Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson.\nOverall: Maye\u2019s fantasy value will tend to go as his rushing value goes. Vrabel and McDaniels will get full utilization of that skill set. Add that to what should be improved passing numbers (even if \u201cimproved\u201d is a relative term in this case), and Maye gets a mid-tier QB2 ranking.\nDraft strategy: He will be one of the many mid-tier QB2s taken in Rounds 10-11.\n18. Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers\nUpside: Jim Harbaugh is a run-first coach, but even he wants to throw the ball more than the Chargers did last year. That\u2019s why Los Angeles drafted Tre Harris and Oronde Gadsden. The vertical game doesn\u2019t need much improvement, given that Herbert ranked second in stretch-vertical FPPG and fifth in vertical FPPG. There is developmental receiving upside on the roster with Ladd McConkey, who was good as a rookie and can be better this year, and Quentin Johnston. This offensive system helped Herbert set career lows in interceptions and interception rate. Herbert has tallied 200+ rush yards and 2+ rush touchdowns in all but one of his five NFL seasons.\nDownside: Harbaugh may want to call more pass plays, but he will never operate a pass-heavy offense. Even with the additions of Harris and Gadsden, this receiving corps needs a lot of improvement to get to par. The offensive line was mediocre last season and could be a work in progress this year. There are only two green-rated fireworks matchups all season, and the campaign begins with three red-rated pass rush matchups in Weeks 1-5.\nAdvertisement\nOverall: A Harbaugh offense will never get a quarterback to post substantial fantasy numbers on quantity alone. Quality is required, and this offense doesn\u2019t have enough of it, so Herbert rates as a mid-tier QB2.\nDraft strategy: Herbert is in the ninth-to-tenth-round range this year.\n19. Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville Jaguars\nUpside: The Jaguars\u2019 new coaching staff is looking for a reset for Lawrence. They\u2019ve got a lot to work with. Before last year, Lawrence had missed only one game in his NFL career. He\u2019s posted top-12 vertical and stretch-vertical numbers before and was just outside of those ranges in last year\u2019s debacle of a season. This offense won\u2019t use him on many planned rushes, but Lawrence is still a productive scrambler and doesn\u2019t shy away from goal-line work. Few teams can match the pass-catching talents of Brian Thomas and rookie Travis Hunter. The offensive line additions could turn a weakness into a strength (or at least no longer a weakness).\nDownside: Adjusting to a new offensive system requires time. Depending on how the preseason plays out, the offensive line will likely have at least two new starters and could have more changes. Hunter and Thomas have one combined NFL season between them. New OC Grant Udinski is only 29 years old and has never been a full-time OC. Lawrence has dealt with injuries for two straight years, which could be a big issue behind a revolving door offensive line. There is only one green-rated fireworks matchup all year, and the season ends with five red-rated vertical coverage matchups in Weeks 12-17.\nOverall: The Jaguars are going all out to build a strong offense around Lawrence. That\u2019s a long-term plus, but fantasy managers can\u2019t count on that upgrade occurring in the short term, leading to a mid-tier QB2 ranking for Lawrence.\nDraft strategy: There won\u2019t be much clamoring to select Lawrence, so he should be available as late as Rounds 10-11.\n20. Michael Penix, Atlanta Falcons\nUpside: The 24.98-point total Penix posted in Week 18 shows there is a high ceiling here if things go well. Penix was the most prolific passer in college football in his 2023 campaign at Washington, leading the nation in passing yards and passing yards per game. Penix also scored seven rushing touchdowns in two years as the Huskies quarterback, so he has a path to marginal rush production. The Falcons have above-average talent at WR/TE and return four offensive line starters, which could lead to an aerial boon since stopping Bijan Robinson will be the primary goal of most defensive coordinators. The passing matchup points total is near the league\u2019s top, giving Penix ample favorable matchup opportunities.\nAdvertisement\nDownside: Kirk Cousins had these top-flight pass-catching talents last year, and he ranked 27th in stretch-vertical FPPG and 23rd in short-pass FPPG. Robinson was second in rushes inside the 10-yard line last season and is on track to mimic that trend in 2025, so Penix isn\u2019t likely to get many goal-line passing opportunities. Penix did next to nothing on the ground outside of the rushing touchdowns in college. This offense will take a similar hands-off rushing approach. Cousins is still on the roster, so he could be a relief pitcher if Penix struggles. Atlanta has the highest rush defense matchup points total, a factor that could reduce the Falcons\u2019 passing volume.\nOverall: He can be a high-volume passer, but this is a Bijan Robinson-centric offense. Combine that with this being Penix\u2019s first full year as a starter and the limited rush volume, and Penix is a midrange QB2.\nDraft strategy: Penix is rated higher here than at most outlets and is a potentially good ROI pick in Rounds 12-13.\n21. Tua Tagovailoa, Miami Dolphins\nUpside: Few fantasy quarterbacks were more productive in the passing game last year. Tagovailoa ranked sixth in overall FPPG and fourth in short-pass FPPG. He has tallied strong vertical and stretch-vertical numbers in the past, making a turnaround from last year\u2019s horrible downfield passing pace (30th in vertical FPPG) possible. There may not be a more talented wide receiver combination than Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. New Miami tight end Darren Waller provides even more downfield receiving skills. HC Mike McDaniel is one of the most innovative play callers around. The high pass rush points could help Tagovailoa stretch the field vertically, as will the very high matchup points total.\nDownside: McDaniel switched this offense from a vertical scheme to a horizontal one because he wanted to keep Tagovailoa healthy \u2014 a major emphasis given the breadth and severity of Tua\u2019s many head injuries over the years. The Miami offensive line has as many question marks this year as last, so short passing may again be the modus operandi. The injury issue has another downside: eliminating almost all of Tagovailoa\u2019s rush value (30th in rush FPPG in 2024). Tagovailoa is one of the most fumble-prone quarterbacks. This team could fire McDaniel during the season if things go south.\nOverall: Unless or until Tagovailoa returns to being the great vertical passer he\u2019s been in past seasons, his fantasy value simply cannot go much higher than mid-tier QB2.\nDraft strategy: He\u2019ll generally move off draft boards in Rounds 11-12.\nAdvertisement\n22. C.J. Stroud, Houston Texans\nUpside: Stroud led the league in stretch-vertical FPPG in his 2023 rookie season and was third in vertical FPPG that year. Getting back to that level will be the goal for new OC Nick Caley. Stroud won\u2019t lack for a receiving corps to do this. Nico Collins was fourth in vertical PPR PPG in 2024, and Dane Brugler\u2019s \u2018The Beast\u2019 NFL Draft Guide indicates second-round pick Jayden Higgins\u2019 game is \u201csimilar to what Nico Collins put on tape at Michigan.\u201d Houston also added Christian Kirk to upgrade at slot wide receiver. Stroud will never be a great rusher, but he is capable of much more than his 1.14 rush FPPG from last season.\nDownside: Houston is basically starting from scratch at offensive line. There are only two returning starters in that group, and one of those players is changing positions. The Texans also have an offensive line coach whose NFL experience is limited to being a co- or assistant offensive line coach. Add that to the OC change, and this offense could take some time to get in sync. Higgins is a work in progress. Stroud didn\u2019t regress last year; he collapsed. He had the fourth-lowest stretch-vertical FPPG and was 25th in vertical FPPG. The schedule is an impediment.\nOverall: If the Texans were as good at the offensive line as they are at receiver, it would be easy to grant Stroud a QB1 grade. With that group in flux (or even worse), Stroud has to be rated as a low-end QB2.\nDraft strategy: The quality depth at the quarterback position means fantasy managers don\u2019t have to reach here. It\u2019s why Stroud should not be taken any earlier than Round 11.\n23. Matthew Stafford, Los Angeles Rams\nUpside: If the move from Cooper Kupp to Davante Adams provides the expected upgrade, the Rams\u2019 passing attack will greatly improve, maybe even enough to shift Stafford back into the top 10 in passing FPPG, a must for his fantasy starter viability. Los Angeles had quality pass-blocking numbers last year and will bring back four starters and a former starter. Sean McVay will get the most out of Puka Nacua and Adams, but he will also dial up creative plays to vertical threat Tutu Atwell and a talented tight end tandem of Tyler Higbee and rookie Terrance Ferguson. Stafford has an incredible ability to fight through injury, and the pass rush matchup points total is a notable plus.\nDownside: Stafford is 37 years old and has taken more than his share of hits. That wear and tear will eventually overcome his moxie to keep playing. Adams may not be much of an upgrade over Kupp. If the passing game doesn\u2019t upgrade notably, Stafford may end up with the same No. 18 ranking in pass FPPG that he had last year. That\u2019s a huge problem since he essentially adds zero on the ground. Stafford has rushed for fewer than 75 yards in six of the past seven seasons and has scored one rushing touchdown since 2016. If those pass and rush trends repeat in 2025, it could lead to another No. 27 ranking in QB FPPG for Stafford, and the matchup points total is about as low as it can get.\nOverall: His upside path can get to mid-tier QB2 status, but that is so reliant on the passing game that it puts Stafford at a disadvantage compared to other QB2 candidates, which is one of the main reasons Stafford ends up near the bottom of this tier.\nAdvertisement\nDraft strategy: The turn from QB2 to QB3 usually hits around Rounds 11-12.\n24. Bryce Young, Carolina Panthers\nUpside: Young was on a tear in the final third of the 2024 season, ranking ninth in QB FPPG in Weeks 12-18. He had three games with 23+ points during that span and five games with 16.5+ points. A big part of the late-season production surge occurred on the ground, with Young scoring five rushing touchdowns in those seven games. That ground prowess led to a No. 7 ranking in rush FPPG and echoed his Alabama rushing numbers. Getting Tetairoa McMillan, the highest-rated WR prospect in the 2025 draft, could provide an immediate pass upgrade. The offensive line returns all five starters, boding well for quality pass blocking when combined with the favorable pass rush points total.\nDownside: Young is one of the smallest quarterbacks in the NFL, listed at 5-foot-10 and 204 pounds. Last year was the second consecutive season that Young had dismal passing numbers. He ranked 33rd in short-pass FPPG, 26th in stretch-vertical FPPG and 22nd in vertical FPPG. McMillan is a rookie, Xavier Legette looks like a bust, and Adam Thielen is old. Combine that with Carolina not possessing a quality tight end, and the Panthers\u2019 receiving corps could be mediocre or worse. There are only three green-rated fireworks matchups on the schedule.\nOverall: It\u2019s tough to bank on a third of a season, but Young has done enough to warrant inclusion at the bottom of the QB2 tier.\nDraft strategy: The end of the QB2 tier usually leaves draft boards in Rounds 11-12.\n25. Aaron Rodgers, Pittsburgh Steelers\nUpside: One area that stood out for Rodgers last year was his stretch-vertical numbers. He ranked ninth in stretch-vertical FPPG and had as many touchdowns at that level as Joe Burrow and Baker Mayfield. With the Steelers adding DK Metcalf to the receiving mix, Rodgers should be able to replicate that downfield success. Rodgers was also ninth in short-pass FPPG, showing he still has mastery of percentage passes. The combination of Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth may give Rodgers the best tight end group he\u2019s ever played with. Pittsburgh has a superb offensive line. The fireworks points total is advantageous, featuring six green-rated matchups in Weeks 7-16.\nDownside: The stretch-vertical production did not prevent Rodgers from tallying a No. 23 ranking in vertical FPPG, a weakness that led to Rodgers finishing outside of the top 10 in pass FPPG for the second consecutive season that he played in (No. 11 in 2024, No. 15 in 2022). His rushing production has dwindled to next to nothing. Rodgers has now posted a double-digit interception mark for consecutive seasons for the first time in his career. He\u2019s 42 and could hit the age wall at any time. This run-centric offense may give Rodgers a low pass attempts ceiling. Three red-rated fireworks matchups and a bye are in Weeks 1-6.\nAdvertisement\nOverall: Rodgers tallied a high-end QB2 season last year due to New York focusing its offense on his passing skills. Mike Tomlin won\u2019t rely on his new QB for various reasons, dropping Rodgers\u2019 fantasy value to the border of the QB2/QB3 tier.\nDraft strategy: Do not draft outside of 2QB/SuperFlex leagues.\n(Photo of Joe Burrow: Dylan Buell / Getty Images)"
