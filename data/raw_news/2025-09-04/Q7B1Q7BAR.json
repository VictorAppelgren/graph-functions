  "description": "Walmart\u2019s Doug McMillon, PVH\u2019s Stefan Larsson and others were out courting Wall Street investors.",
  "content": "As the fashion types begin to migrate to New York for the start of fashion week, the C-suite bigwigs were leaning in on Wall Street, courting investors at Goldman Sachs\u2019 annual retail conference.\n\nThe message du jour is about control.\n\u2022 What to Watch: Tapestry and Ralph Lauren Look to Extend Stock Run\n\u2022 PVH Corp. Nudges Up Revenue Forecast as Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger Gear Up for Major Fall Campaigns\n\nRetail and fashion executives are looking to control what they can in a world where so many things \u2014 from tariffs to the economy \u2014 are moving of their own accord.\n\nTalking about controlling what you can control is a clever approach, acknowledging that the market is unstable, while emphasizing that there\u2019s a steady hand on the wheel.\n\nThe steadiest hand these days might well be that of Doug McMillon, chief executive officer of Walmart Inc., who is courting the mass consumer with the discounter\u2019s \u201csave money and live better\u201d approach, while also building a profitable e-commerce business that draws in higher-end consumers..\n\n\u201cIf you look at the middle- to upper-income levels, we\u2019re seeing strong demand,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cAnd if you look at middle to lower, there\u2019s been a little bit of stress. And we\u2019ve seen behavioral change on items that have gone up in cost because of tariffs, where they\u2019re switching from one item to the other. Some of the behavioral stuff that you always see during times of pressure.\n\n\u201cBut generally speaking, people have held up really well and we expect the same thing to happen for the balance of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cBig picture, customers want low prices, a really broad assortment, a great experience buying it and they want to do business with somebody they trust. And e-commerce changed the game, obviously, as it relates to retail. The assortment that you can get is incredible. And the delivery, accuracy, and speed, we\u2019re all learning how to improve as it relates to that.\u201d\n\nWalmart isn\u2019t alone in trying to fine-tune after refocusing its business \u2014 it\u2019s kind of a mini-trend right now.\n\nLevi Strauss & Co. has really been pushing its evolution into a much more retail-oriented business and has gotten a lot of spotlight over the last year with its Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter ads.\n\nNow the brand has to follow up on the Queen Bey.\n\nHarmit Singh, chief financial and growth officer at Levi\u2019s, said the denim giant plans to sustain the marketing momentum.\n\n\u201cThis year was about music,\u201d Singh said. \u201cNext year, we\u2019ve got the Super Bowl at the Levi\u2019s Stadium, we\u2019ve got the World Cup at the Levi\u2019s Stadium. There are definitely a couple of things that we feel over time will continue to maintain the sustained growth that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019d like to be a mid-digit-growth company, which is about 5 percent.\u201d\n\nLike many other brands, Levi\u2019s is more cautious going into the second half, but feeling good about what it can control.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very confident about our product offers and our marketing,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThere are probably going to be winners and losers as the macroeconomics play out, I think we\u2019ll be in the winners category because we have the product, we have the people, we have the stores and we have great marketing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a playbook a lot of the big companies are working from.\n\nStefan Larsson, CEO at PVH Corp., has been rebuilding the approach at the company\u2019s two mega brands: Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.\n\n\u201cWe lean into the iconic brand love,\u201d Larsson told analysts. \u201cWe lean into the biggest and most iconic categories. We put a lot of innovation into the most important products. We amplify it with cut-through campaigns. In Calvin in the second quarter, you saw where we have put innovation into underwear, we\u2019re up 14 percent. Where we have put innovation into new denim, we\u2019re up 19 percent.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been an easy transition, especially as Calvin Klein looked to centralize its design in New York.\n\n\u201cCalvin Klein two, three years ago had a completely decentralized product creation,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cSo we pulled it together and built global product creation capabilities, same as we already have for Tommy. And we were overconfident \u2014 took too many parts of this together in one season. And the team realized that they were on their heels in the middle of a product season, and it had a big negative impact on the gross margin this year. It\u2019s super frustrating.\u201d\n\nBut he said the company rolled up its sleeves and is now much better set for the long term.\n\n\u201cThere is not a single successful competitor that doesn\u2019t have a global product capability,\u201d Larsson said. \u201cWe had to do it, and we hit some turbulence and then we fixed it. But that\u2019s why I wanted to just shout out to say, it was painful to share last quarter. It\u2019s less painful today because we have fixed it.\u201d\n\nSign up for WWD's Newsletter.

      "text": "PVH Corp. Nudges Up Revenue Forecast as Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger Gear Up for Major Fall Campaigns\nThe parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger nudged up its full-year revenue forecast as it plans to break the internet again with more blockbuster campaigns after the success of its Bad Bunny ad.\nPVH Corp. now expects fiscal 2025 revenue to increase slightly by low single digits compared to flat to increase slightly previously, while adjusted profits per share for this year are still expected to come in at $10.75 to $11, the fashion company said Tuesday.\nMore from WWD\n-\nClaudia Schiffer and Nicholas Hoult Feature in 'The Hilfiger Racing Club' Campaign\n-\nMingyu Fronts Calvin Klein's Fall 2025 Campaign as Brand Updates Denim and Underwear Collections\nIts stock price rose more than 4 percent in after-hours trading following the release of second-quarter earnings, having closed up 1.09 percent at $82.49. The stock is down 22 percent in the year to date.\n\u201cIn terms of the outlook, it\u2019s continuing this momentum that we created in Calvin and Tommy around the innovation of iconic products, the cut-through campaigns and cut-through talent and then stronger and stronger marketplace executions,\u201d said Stefan Larsson, chief executive officer, in an interview with WWD, teasing what was in the works.\n\u201cComing into the fall, both Calvin and Tommy are geared up to keep the momentum from Q2,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are about to launch what I believe is the strongest fall campaign from Calvin so far. In women\u2019s underwear, we are doing the equivalent of what we did with Bad Bunny.\u201d\nThat means building on the product innovation around men\u2019s underwear and bringing that to women\u2019s underwear, with a campaign led by \u201cone of the biggest music stars in the world\u201d to be released shortly.\nFor the second quarter, revenue came in at $2.17 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $2.12 billion.\nAdjusted earnings per share came in at $2.52, compared to $3.01 in the prior-year period, but topping Wall Street estimates of $2.01.\nCalvin Klein was up 5 percent, driven by sales of denim and underwear. On the back of the aforementioned Bad Bunny campaign, sales of Cotton Stretch styles grew 14 percent globally, on top of 25 percent growth in the first quarter.\nOver at Tommy Hilfiger, revenue increased 4 percent compared to the prior-year period, boosted in part by the brand\u2019s partnership with the \u201cF1\u201d movie, starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris.\nAt the same time, Tommy Hilfiger and Cadillac Formula 1 Team forged a multiyear partnership setting the fashion brand up as the team\u2019s official apparel partner. On Tuesday, Cadillac named Sergio P\u00e9rez and Valtteri Bottas as its drivers in the sport next season."

      "text": "In yet another strong quarter, Walmart saw solid gains on both its top and bottom lines, demonstrating the giant retailer\u2019s ability to manage through the scourge of tariffs and navigate the uncertain economy.\nWalmart sales benefited from its low price appeal and particular strength in groceries, as consumers across all income brackets shopped in search of strong values. The company said previously that it would be able to absorb some tariff-related price increases but not all. Faster deliveries also contributed to the gains.\n\u201cWith regard to our U.S. pricing decisions, given tariff-related cost pressures, we\u2019re doing what we said we would do. We\u2019re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can,\u201d Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive officer, said during a conference call Thursday morning with investors and industry analysts.\n\u201cOur merchants have been creative, and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers, and members. They\u2019ve done a terrific job managing pricing and mix across merchandise categories. They managed to generate rollbacks. They made good quantity, and flow decisions, and they\u2019ve set us up well as we start the back half of the year.\n\u201cThe impact of tariffs has been gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted,\u201d McMillon added. \u201cBut as we replenish inventory at post tariff price levels, we\u2019ve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.\u201d\nRegarding the pace of business through the second half, McMillon said, \u201cBack-to-school is usually something of an indicator of how the holidays will go, and we feel good about how it went for us in terms of units and dollars sold and inventory sell through at both Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club. Our top back-to-school items had a lower price than last year, and we offered a basket of everything students need for their first day of school for under $65. We had our Walmart U.S. store managers together last week for our holiday planning meeting, where they got to see many of our new items, and pricing for the upcoming season. We liked what we saw and heard, and we like our position for the back half of the year. We\u2019re expecting to have a good holiday season at Walmart.\u201d\nIn the second quarter ended July 31, operating income, impacted by legal and restructuring costs, decreased 8.2 percent to $7.3 billion from $7.9 billion in the year-ago period. But on an adjusted basis, operating income was up 0.4 percent to $8 billion, from $7.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Net income rose 56 percent to $7 billion from $4.5 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nRevenues rose 4.8 percent to $177.4 billion from $169.3 billion in the year-ago period. Global e-commerce sales grew 25 percent, led by store-fulfilled pickups and deliveries, and momentum in the marketplace business. By contrast, Target\u2019s second quarter sales of $25.2 billion were down 1.2 percent.\nThe Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer raised its forecast for sales gains this year to 3.75 percent to 4.75 percent, up from the previous forecast of sales gains ranging from 3 percent to 4 percent.\nThe company also raised its forecast for adjusted earnings per share to $2.52 to $2.62, up from the previous forecast of $2.50 to $2.60 per adjusted share.\nWith Wall Street expecting earnings to be better than what was reported, and concerned about rising prices as the year progresses, Walmart\u2019s stock was down 4.5 percent, or $4.61, to $97.96 when the market closed Thursday afternoon.\nDuring the call, McMillon was bullish on AI. \u201cOur enthusiasm for how AI can help us serve customers and members better, improve the experience for our associates, and increase productivity continues to grow,\u201d he said.\nIn addition providing more personalized shopping experiences, AI, he said, \u201cwill be the primary digital vehicle for discovery, shopping, and for managing everything from reorders to returns.\u201d For associates, AI \u201cwill bring everything into one place from scheduling to sales data, one for our suppliers, sellers, and advertisers that they will use to manage things like onboarding, orders, and campaigns.\u201d And he said, AI will help scale innovation across the business \u201cby speeding up how we test, build, and launch new products.\u201d\nContinued strength was seen in Walmart\u2019s grocery business in the U.S., which rose by midsingle digits, while the health and wellness business in the U.S. increased in the mid-teens, the company indicated. The retailer also said that it saw share gains \u201cacross income brackets led by upper-income households\u201d in its U.S. stores.\n\u201cSales and general merchandise were positive in every segment and across categories in the U.S. led by apparel, media, and gaming, and automotive,\u201d McMillon said during his conference call with investors and industry analysts. \u201cAgain, this quarter, we gained market share in the U.S., and across markets internationally. Globally we grew our marketplace by 17 percent and membership income by 15 percent. We grew global advertising by 46 percent, including Vizio,\u201d the producer of televisions, sound bars and software purchased by Walmart in 2024. \u201cWalmart Connect (the retail media advertising platform) in the U.S. was up 31 percent and excludes Vizio,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cThe strong growth rates in our newer businesses continue to change the shape of our income statement.\u201d\nR.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, an AI-powered location analysts platform, said, \u201cWalmart appears to be one of retail\u2019s winners during the second quarter of 2025. The company\u2019s U.S. comparable store sales growth of 4.6 percent \u2014including a 1.5 percent increase in comparable transactions\u2014implies it was a key destination for consumers both online and in-store. While the company cited strong growth in grocery and health and wellness, it also appears to be gaining market share across other categories. These broad market share gains were likely a key reason the company raised its sales growth outlook for the year.\u201d\nAccording to Placer.ai, \u201cWalmart demonstrated resilient in-store traffic, with same-store visits holding steady between 0.8 percent and -1.6 percent year-over-year from May through July 2025, even amid a major e-commerce push.\u201d\n\u201cWalmart\u2019s strong top-line performance shows that its strong focus on value and low prices continues to resonate with shoppers across income levels, with outsize gains coming from its e-commerce and ads businesses,\u201d Sky Canaves, a principal analyst at Emarketer, said Thursday. \u201cAll of these benefited from the large-scale July promotional events that coincided with Amazon\u2019s longer Prime Day, with Walmart capturing additional traffic over the weekends that bookended Amazon\u2019s sale. But the miss on profits will raise questions about how much Walmart\u2019s margins are being squeezed by tariff pressures and how it will approach pricing through the second half of the year to avoid alienating customers.\u201d"

      "text": "PVH Corp., the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, may have nudged up its sales forecast for next year, but it is still grappling with the increasingly complex tariffs landscape.\nThe company expects the tariffs currently in place to have an overall net negative impact on earnings in 2025, including an approximately $70 million unmitigated impact to earnings before interest and taxes or approximately $1.15 per share compared to previous guidance of $65 million and $1.05 per share.\nMore from WWD\n\u201cWe expect to mitigate some of these costs through strategic actions in the second half of the year and fully mitigate the impact over time. But for this year, some we will need to absorb. The net impact of the tariffs and these mitigation actions are embedded within our guidance,\u201d Zac Coughlin, chief financial officer of PVH, said during a call with analysts.\nAt the same time, he provided an update on mitigation efforts.\n\u201cWe\u2019d previously communicated that we\u2019d mitigate approximately 50 percent of the costs of the prior cost in 2025, with more over time. With the newly announced rates coming in for Q4 for us so around 2 times higher than we previously had talked about, we do see that mitigation costs being a little bit lower for 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most importantly, we expect to continue to expand on our mitigation efforts through the strategic actions throughout 2026.\u201d\n\u201cJust like all of our competitors, we are working through how to best mitigate the tariffs in a way that keeps our competitive positioning,\u201d added Stefan Larsson, CEO of PVH, on the call.\n\u201cWe assess every part of the value chain and it\u2019s still early, but we are well-positioned to work through this in a competitive way.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, PVH Corp. said it expects fiscal 2025 revenue to increase slightly by low-single digits compared to flat to increase slightly previously, while adjusted profits per share for this year are still expected to come in at $10.75 to $11.\nIt reaffirmed its full-year outlook for operating margins at 8.5 percent, down from 10 percent last year.\nIts stock closed Wednesday down 0.92 percent at $81.73.\nBest of WWD\n-\nHarvey Nichols Sees Sales Dip, Losses Widen in Year Marred by Closures\n-\nNike Logs $1.3 Billion Profit, But Supply Chain Issues Persist\nSign up for WWD's Newsletter.

      "text": "The traditional wisdom is that the stock market projects what\u2019s going to happen in six months.\nInvestors want to get in early on a good thing and then get out while the getting\u2019s still good. The game is about seeing where the growth is going to be and keeping just ahead of it.\nMore from WWD\n-\nWhat to Watch: Luxury Brands Need to Win Back Aspirational Shoppers, Before It's Too Late\n-\nWalmart Reports Strong Second-quarter Results, Lifts Outlook for 2025\nIt\u2019s an impossible game, of course.\nBut with all the millions of investors making their best guess, the wisdom of the crowd reveals itself, such as it is.\nIf Wall Street were a social media platform, it would be just so much more noise. But the stakes are high in the stock world, with fortunes won and lost and the IRL value of companies large and small set and reset on a moment-to-moment basis.\nSo far this year, investors have been looking for safety and putting money into already strong companies like Coach parent Tapestry Inc., Ralph Lauren Corp., Levi Strauss & Co., off-pricer TJX Cos. Inc. and Walmart Inc. \u2014 all of which have outperformed the S&P 500\u2019s 9.1 percent gain for 2025 so far.\nSome beaten down companies did enjoy a rebound \u2014 shares of Kohl\u2019s Corp. have risen more than 18 percent this year \u2014 but they are the exception rather than the rule.\nInvestors justifying sky-high stock prices have to see a future full of even more growth, something the darlings of years past, including Abercrombie & Fitch Co., down more than 38 percent, and Lululemon Athletica Inc., down almost 48 percent, need to prove again.\nAnd succeeding on Wall Street means proving it every day \u2014 a proposition only complicated by a retail world that is, well, more complicated.\nIf it\u2019s not the on-and-off tariffs of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war or worries about the Federal Reserve, it\u2019s the rise of artificial intelligence or sagging consumer confidence.\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s Surveys of Consumers last month reported that its closely watched consumer sentiment index hit 58.2 \u2014 down 5.7 percent from July and off 14.3 percent from a year earlier.\nIt\u2019s a downturn that seems to be hitting most consumers and brands.\nJoanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers, said: \u201cThis month\u2019s decrease was visible across groups by age, income and stock wealth. Moreover, perceptions of many aspects of the economy slipped. Buying conditions for durable goods subsided to their lowest reading in a year, and current personal finances declined 7 percent, both due to heightened concerns about high prices. Expectations for business conditions and labor markets contracted in August as well.\u201d"

Walmart\u2019s Doug McMillon highlighted a low\u2011price strategy, e\u2011commerce expansion, and AI adoption, while PVH\u2019s Stefan Larsson and Levi Strauss & Co. outlined product innovation and marketing momentum to drive revenue. Levi\u2019s plans to sustain growth through high\u2011profile events, and PVH nudged up its revenue outlook despite tariff challenges. Overall, executives stressed resilience and focus on product, pricing, and digital channels to navigate macro pressures.",
