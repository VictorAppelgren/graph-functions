The AUD 3 billion development will supply power for up to 500,000 homes, create up to 400 construction jobs, and inject more than AUD 30 million annually into the Tasmanian economy, alongside a AUD 27 million community benefits program. The project is expected to begin generating power in 2030, helping Australia meet emissions targets and address looming power shortages as coal exits the system.",
