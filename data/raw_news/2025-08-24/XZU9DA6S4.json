  "description": "Powell is worried about inflation and how Trump's tariffs could potentially push it higher.",
  "content": "Powell is worried about inflation and how Trump\u2019s tariffs could potentially push it higher.\n\nFor months, Powell has largely ignored President Donald Trump\u2019s constant hectoring that he reduce borrowing costs. Yet on Friday, in a highly-anticipated speech, Powell suggested that the Fed could take such a step as soon as its next meeting in September. It will be a fraught decision for the Fed, which must weigh it against persistent inflation and an economy that could also improve in the second half of this year. Both trends, if they occur, could make a cut look premature. Trump has urged Powell to slash rates, arguing there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and saying that a cut would lower the government\u2019s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.\n\nPowell, on the other hand, has suggested that a rate cut is likely for reasons quite different than Trump\u2019s: He is worried that the economy is weakening. His remarks on Friday at an economic symposium in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming also indicated that the Fed will move carefully and cut rates at a much slower pace than Trump wants. Powell pointed to economic growth that \u201chas slowed notably in the first half of this year,\u201d to an annual rate of 1.2 percent, down from 2.5 percent last year. There has also been a \u201cmarked slowing\u201d in the demand for workers, he added, which threatens to raise unemployment. Still, Powell said that tariffs have started to lift the price of goods and could continue to push inflation higher, a possibility Fed officials will closely monitor and that will make them cautious about additional rate cuts.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s key short-term interest rate, which influences other borrowing costs for things like mortgages and auto loans, is currently 4.3 percent. Trump has called for it to be cut as low as 1 percent \u2014 a level no Fed official supports. However the Fed moves forward, it will likely do so while continuing to assert its longstanding independence. A politically independent central bank is considered by most economists as critical to preventing inflation, because it can take steps \u2014 such as raising interest rates to cool the economy and combat inflation \u2014 that are harder for elected officials to do. There are 19 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee, 12 of whom vote on rate decisions. One of them, Beth Hammack, president of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Cleveland branch, said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press that she is committed to the Fed\u2019s independence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m laser focused \u2026 on ensuring that I can deliver good outcomes for the for the public, and I try to tune out all the other noise,\u201d she said. She remains concerned that the Fed still needs to fight stubborn inflation, a view shared by several colleagues. \u201cInflation is too high and it\u2019s been trending in the wrong direction,\u201d Hammack said. \u201cRight now I see us moving away from our goals on the inflation side.\u201d\n\nPowell himself did not discuss the Fed\u2019s independence during his speech in Wyoming, where he received a standing ovation by the assembled academics, economists, and central bank officials from around the world. But Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that was likely a deliberate choice and intended, ironically, to demonstrate the Fed\u2019s independence. \u201cThe not talking about independence was a way of trying as best they could to signal we\u2019re getting on with the business,\u201d Posen said. \u201cWe\u2019re still having a civilized internal discussion about the merits of the issue. And even if it pleases the president, we\u2019re going to make the right call.\u201d It was against that backdrop that Trump intensified his own pressure campaign against another top Fed official.\n\nTrump said he would fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook if she did not step down from her position. Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to head the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged Wednesday that Cook committed mortgage fraud when she bought two properties in 2021. She has not been charged. Cook has said she would not be \u201cbullied\u201d into giving up her position. She declined Friday to comment on Trump\u2019s threat. If Cook is somehow removed, that would give Trump an opportunity to put a loyalist on the Fed\u2019s governing board. Members of the board vote on all interest rate decisions. He has already nominated a top White House economist, Stephen Miran, to replace former governor Adriana Kugler, who stepped down Aug. 1.\n\nTrump had previously threatened to fire Powell, but hasn\u2019t done so. Trump appointed Powell in late 2017. His term as chair ends in about nine months. Powell is no stranger to Trump\u2019s attacks. Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that the president also went after him in 2018 for raising interest rates, but that didn\u2019t stop Powell. \u201cThe president has a long history of applying pressure to Chairman Powell,\u201d Strain said. \u201cAnd Chairman Powell has a long history of resisting that pressure. So it would be odd, I think, if on his way out the door, he caved for the first time.\u201d",

      "text": "Why the Federal Reserve has historically been independent of the White House\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump this week called on a Federal Reserve governor to resign over an accusation of mortgage fraud, the latest effort by his administration to exert greater control over one of the few remaining independent agencies in Washington.\nFederal Reserve governor Lisa Cook says she won\u2019t leave her post.\nTrump has repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him. Powell, who will speak Friday at an economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs on imports, which Powell says could push up inflation.\nPowell\u2019s caution has infuriated Trump, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt. Trump has also accused Powell of mismanaging the U.S. central bank\u2019s $2.5 billion building renovation project.\nFiring the Fed chair or forcing out a governor would threaten the Fed\u2019s venerated independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors. Here\u2019s what to know about the Fed:\nWhy the Fed\u2019s independence matters\nThe Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls \u2014 which it typically does when the economy falters \u2014 the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, accelerating growth and hiring. When it raises the rate \u2014 which it does to cool the economy and combat inflation \u2014 it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.\nEconomists have long preferred independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates, which makes borrowing to buy a home, car, or appliance more expensive.\nThe importance of an independent Fed was cemented for most economists after the extended inflation spike of the 1970s and early 1980s. Former Fed Chair Arthur Burns has been widely blamed for allowing the painful inflation of that era to accelerate by succumbing to pressure from President Richard Nixon to keep rates low heading into the 1972 election. Nixon feared higher rates would cost him the election, which he won in a landslide.\nPaul Volcker was eventually appointed chair of the Fed in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, and he pushed the Fed\u2019s short-term rate to the stunningly high level of nearly 20%. (It is currently 4.3%). The eye-popping rates triggered a sharp recession, pushed unemployment to nearly 11%, and spurred widespread protests.\nYet Volcker didn\u2019t flinch. By the mid-1980s, inflation had fallen back into the low single digits. Volcker\u2019s willingness to inflict pain on the economy to throttle inflation is seen by most economists as a key example of the value of an independent Fed.\nInvestors are watching closely\nAn effort to fire Powell would almost certainly cause stock prices to fall and bond yields to spike higher, pushing up interest rates on government debt and raising borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit card debt. The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury is a benchmark for mortgage rates.\nMost investors prefer an independent Fed, partly because it typically manages inflation better without being influenced by politics but also because its decisions are more predictable. Fed officials often publicly discuss how they would alter interest rate policies if economic conditions changed.\nIf the Fed was more swayed by politics, it would be harder for financial markets to anticipate \u2014 or understand \u2014 its decisions.\nThe Fed\u2019s independence doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unaccountable\nFed chairs like Powell are appointed by the president to serve four-year terms, and have to be confirmed by the Senate. The president also appoints the six other members of the Fed\u2019s governing board, who can serve staggered terms of up to 14 years.\nThose appointments can allow a president over time to significantly alter the Fed\u2019s policies. Former president Joe Biden appointed four of the current seven members: Powell, Cook, Philip Jefferson, and Michael Barr. A fifth Biden appointee, Adriana Kugler, stepped down unexpectedly on Aug. 1, about five months before the end of her term. Trump has already nominated his top economist, Stephen Miran, as a potential replacement, though he will require Senate approval. Cook\u2019s term ends in 2038, so forcing her out would allow Trump to appoint a loyalist sooner.\nTrump will be able to replace Powell as Fed chair in May 2026, when Powell\u2019s term expires. Yet 12 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the Chair doesn\u2019t guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants.\nCongress, meanwhile, can set the Fed\u2019s goals through legislation. In 1977, for example, Congress gave the Fed a \u201cdual mandate\u201d to keep prices stable and seek maximum employment. The Fed defines stable prices as inflation at 2%.\nThe 1977 law also requires the Fed chair to testify before the House and Senate twice every year about the economy and interest rate policy.\nCould the president fire Powell before his term ends?\nThe Supreme Court earlier this year suggested in a ruling on other independent agencies that a president can\u2019t fire the chair of the Fed just because he doesn\u2019t like the chair\u2019s policy choices. But he may be able to remove him \u201cfor cause,\u201d typically interpreted to mean some kind of wrongdoing or negligence.\nIt\u2019s a likely reason the Trump administration has zeroed in on the building renovation, in hopes it could provide a \u201cfor cause\u201d pretext. Still, Powell would likely fight any attempt to remove him, and the case could wind up at the Supreme Court."

Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.\nTrump followed up Pulte\u2019s accusation by calling on Cook to resign, in the latest effort by the administration to exert greater control over one of the few remaining independent agencies in Washington. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him.\nIf Cook is forced off the Fed\u2019s governing board, it would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.\nPulte urged the Justice Department to investigate Cook, who was appointed to the Fed\u2019s governing board by former president Joe Biden in 2022. She was reappointed the following year to a term that lasts until 2038, the longest remaining term among the seven governors.\nCook also said, \u201cI do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\u201d\nPulte, in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, said that on June 18, 2021, Cook purchased a home in Ann Arbor and then two weeks later bought a condo in Atlanta. Before joining the Fed, Cook taught at Michigan State University. Pulte also charged that Cook has listed her condo in Atlanta for rent.\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.\nJust last month, Trump blasted Powell for the ballooning cost of the renovation of two of the Fed\u2019s headquarters buildings, even suggesting that the run-up in costs could constitute a firing offense. He backed off his threats to fire Powell after receiving a tour of the project.\nPulte also suggested that Cook\u2019s alleged actions could constitute a fireable offense. Fed officials are protected by law from being removed by a president, except \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is generally seen as some kind of malfeasance or dereliction of duty.\nEither way, if Trump seeks to fire Cook, it could lead to a court battle over a president\u2019s power to remove Fed governors.\nSenate Democrats, including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, expressed support for Cook and slammed Trump\u2019s actions.\n\u201cTrump is a liar. Lisa Cook\u2014stand tough and don\u2019t let Trump intimidate you,\u201d Schumer wrote in a post on social media platform X.\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a statement that Trump \u201chas been scrambling for a pretext to intimidate or fire Chair Powell and members of the Federal Reserve Board while blaming anyone but himself for how his failed economic policies are hurting Americans.\u201d\nTrump will be able to replace Chair Jerome Powell in May 2026, when Powell\u2019s term expires. Yet 12 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the Chair doesn\u2019t guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants.\nBut the more members of the Fed\u2019s governing board that Trump can appoint, the more control he will be able to assert over the Fed, which has long been considered independent from day-to-day politics.\nAll seven members of the Fed\u2019s governing board are able to vote on rate decisions. The other five voters include the president of the Fed\u2019s New York branch and a rotating group of four of the presidents of the Fed\u2019s other 11 regional branches.\nTrump appointed two members of the Fed\u2019s board in his first term, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. Both dissented July 30 from the central bank\u2019s decision to keep its rate unchanged, in favor of a rate cut.\nAnother Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1, and Trump has nominated one of his economic advisers, Stephen Miran, to fill out the remainder of her term until January.\nIf Trump is able to replace Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed\u2019s board, as well as Kugler, that would give him a clear majority on the board of governors. If Powell leaves the board when his term as chair ends next May, then Trump will be able to fill a fifth spot. However, Powell could stay on the board until early 2028 after finishing his term as chair.\nThe presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks are selected by the boards of directors of those banks, but are subject to the approval of the Fed\u2019s board of governors. The terms of all 12 of the regional Fed presidents end next February.\nTrump has for months demanded that the Federal Reserve reduce the short-term interest rate it controls, which currently stands at about 4.3%. He has also repeatedly insulted Powell, who has said that the Fed would like to see more evidence of how the economy evolves in response to Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs before making any moves. Powell has also said the duties threaten to raise inflation and slow growth.\nTrump says that a lower rate would reduce the government\u2019s borrowing costs on $37 trillion in debt and boost the housing market by reducing mortgage rates. Yet mortgage borrowing costs and other interest rates, including many of the ones the government pays, do not always follow the Fed\u2019s rate decisions.\nThe Trump administration has made similar claims of mortgage fraud against Democrats that Trump has attacked, including California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James."

      "text": "Trump to nominate top economic aide Stephen Miran to Federal Reserve board\nTrump to nominate top economic aide Stephen Miran to Federal Reserve board\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Thursday he will nominate a top economic adviser to the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors for four months, temporarily filling a vacancy while continuing his search for a longer-term appointment.\nTrump said he has named Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a seat vacated by governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee who is stepping down Friday. Miran, if approved by the Senate, will serve until January 31, 2026.\nThe appointment is Trump\u2019s first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining independent federal agencies. Trump has relentlessly criticized the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping short-term interest rates unchanged, calling him \u201ca stubborn MORON\u201d last week on social media.\nMiran has been a major defender of Trump\u2019s income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He also has played down the risk of Trump\u2019s tariffs generating higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell.\nThe choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Fed independence is generally seen as key to ensuring that it can take difficult steps to combat inflation, such as raising interest rates, that politicians might be unwilling to take.\nFederal Reserve governors vote on all the central bank\u2019s interest-rate decisions, as well as its financial regulatory policies.\nMiran\u2019s nomination, if approved, would add a near-certain vote in support of lower interest rates. Kugler had echoed Powell\u2019s view that the Fed should keep rates unchanged and further evaluate the impact of tariffs on the economy before making any moves.\nTrump has said he will appoint Fed officials who will cut interest rates, which he says will reduce the borrowing costs of the federal government\u2019s huge $36 trillion debt pile. Trump also wants lower rates to boost moribund home sales, which have been held back partly by higher mortgage costs. Yet the Fed doesn\u2019t directly set longer-term interest rates for things like home and car purchases.\nAt its most recent meeting last week, Fed officials kept their key rate unchanged at 4.3%, where it has stood after three rate cuts late last year. But two Fed governors \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 dissented from that decision. Both were appointed by Trump in his first term.\nStill, even with Miran on the board, 12 Fed officials vote on interest rate policy and many remain concerned that Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months.\nMiran could be renominated to a longer term on the Fed once his initial appointment is concluded, or replaced by another nominee.\nPowell\u2019s term as chair ends in May 2026. Yet, Powell could remain on the board of governors until January 2028, even after he steps down as chair. That would deny, or at least delay, an opportunity for Trump to appoint an additional policymaker to the Fed\u2019s board.\nAs a result, one option for Trump is to appoint Powell\u2019s eventual replacement as chair to replace Kugler once the remaining four months of her term are completed. Leading candidates for that position include Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor from 2006 to 2011 and frequent critic of Powell\u2019s chairmanship, and Kevin Hassett, another top Trump economic adviser.\nAnother option for the White House next May would be to select Waller, who is already on the board, to replace Powell, and who has been widely mentioned as a candidate.\nMarco Casiraghi, senior economist at investment bank Evercore ISI, noted that the choice of Miran could be a positive sign for Waller, because Trump did not take the opportunity to nominate someone likely to become chair once Powell steps down.\nAfter the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again. The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,\u201d Miran said on MSNBC. \u201cAnd the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president\u2019s view.\u201d\nLast year, Miran expressed support for some unconventional economic views in commentaries on the Fed and international economics.\nLast November, he proposed measures that would reduce the value of the dollar in order to boost exports, reduce imports and cut the U.S. trade deficit, a top priority for Trump. He also suggested tariffs could push U.S. trading partners, such as the European Union and Japan, to accept a cheaper dollar as part of a \u201cMar-a-Lago Accord,\u201d an echo of the Plaza Accord reached in the 1980s that lowered the dollar\u2019s value.\nAs a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, Miran in March 2024 also proposed overhauling the Fed\u2019s governance, including by making it easier for a president to fire members of its board of governors.\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s current governance has facilitated groupthink that has led to significant monetary-policy errors,\u201d Miran wrote in a paper with Dan Katz, now a top official at the Treasury Department.\n___"

      "text": "As Trump ramps up attacks on the Federal Reserve, Chair Powell refuses to change course\nAs Trump ramps up attacks on the Federal Reserve, Chair Powell refuses to change course\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday stuck to his position that the central bank will keep its key rate on hold while it waits to see how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs effect the economy, despite the steady stream of criticism from the White House, which wants lower borrowing costs.\nPowell, speaking in Sintra, Portugal, at a conference hosted by the European Central Bank, also said that U.S. inflation is likely to pick up later this summer, though he acknowledged that the timing and magnitude of any price increase from the duties is uncertain. But he said the Fed will keep rates on hold while it evaluates the impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy.\n\u201cAs long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\u201d Powell said, referring to the sweeping duties Trump has imposed this year.\nPowell\u2019s comments underscored the divide between the U.S. central bank\u2019s leader and the Trump administration. Trump has repeatedly urged the Fed to cut its key rate, which he says would save U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars on interest costs on the federal government\u2019s massive debt, and boost the economy. The fight has threatened the Fed\u2019s traditional independence from politics, though since the Supreme Court signaled the president can\u2019t fire the chair, financial markets haven\u2019t responded to Trump\u2019s criticism.\nThe Fed chair also said that without tariffs, the Fed would probably be cutting its key rate right now. The central bank went \u201con hold\u201d after it saw how large Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs were, Powell said, and economists began forecasting higher inflation.\nAt the same time, Powell did not rule out a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s next policy meeting July 29-30.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table,\u201d Powell said. Most economists, however, expect the Fed won\u2019t reduce rates until September at the earliest.\nOn Monday, the president attacked Powell again and extended his criticisms to the entire Fed governing board, which participates in interest-rate decisions.\n\u201cThe board just sits there and watches, so they are equally to blame,\u201d Trump said. The attack on the board ratchets up pressure on individual Fed officials, such as Governor Chris Waller, who have been mentioned as potential successors to Powell, whose term ends in May 2026.\nWhen asked during a panel discussion with other central bankers what keeps him awake at night, Powell referred to the fact that there are just 10 months left in his term.\n\u201cAll I want and all anybody at the Fed wants is to deliver an economy that has price stability, maximum employment, financial stability,\u201d he said.\nPowell was also asked whether Trump\u2019s attacks make his job harder, and he responded, \u201cI\u2019m very focused on just doing my job.\u201d\nThe other central bankers onstage, including Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan, and Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, joined the audience in applauding Powell\u2019s comment.\n\u201cWe would do exactly the same thing as Jay Powell has done,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cThe same thing.\u201d\nOn Monday, Trump posted a note on social media that listed 44 countries in order of the interest rates set by their central banks. The list showed that Switzerland, Cambodia, and Japan have the lowest short-term rates of 0.25% to 0.5%. \u201cShould be here,\u201d Trump wrote on the list, referring to the Fed.\nYet central banks typically lower their rates when their economies are weaker, to boost borrowing and spending and support growth. The Fed cut its short-term rate to nearly zero during the pandemic for that reason. It rapidly lifted borrowing costs in 2022 and 2023 to combat the worst inflation spike in four decades.\nTrump has been particularly focused on the idea that Fed rate cuts would sharply reduce the government\u2019s borrowing costs.\nYet it\u2019s not necessarily the case that a cut would lower other borrowing costs for things such as mortgages, car loans, or business loans. The short-term rate the Fed controls influences other interest rates, but the markets also play a significant role.\nAs a result, a rate cut by the Fed wouldn\u2019t automatically lower the interest rates paid by Treasury securities, particularly longer-term rates such as the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which strongly affects mortgage rates.\nIn fact, when the Powell Fed first cut its short-term rate last September, the 10-year yield actually rose, lifting mortgage rates and other borrowing costs.\nThe Fed has kept its key short-term interest rate unchanged this year, at about 4.3%, after cutting it three times in 2024.\nAt a news conference in June, Powell suggested that the central bank would \u201clearn a great deal more over the summer\u201d about whether President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs would push up inflation or not. The comment suggested the Fed wouldn\u2019t consider cutting rates until its September meeting.\nYet a few days later, Fed governors Waller and Michelle Bowman, who were both appointed by Trump, said that it was unlikely the tariffs would lead to persistent inflation. Both also indicated that they would likely support reducing the Fed\u2019s rate in July.\nSo far, inflation has mostly continued to cool, despite the imposition of the duties on nearly all U.S. imports. Consumer prices rose just 2.4% in May compared with a year earlier, not far from the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target and much lower than a year ago."

      "text": "US inflation held steady as mild tariff hit offset by cheaper gas, food\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were balanced by falling gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago.\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June. Both figures are above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.\nThe new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. Many businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties. Tuesday\u2019s figures probably reflect some impact from the 10% universal tariff Trump imposed in April, as well as higher duties on countries such as China and Canada.\nBrian Bethune, an economist at Boston College, said that overall U.S. tariffs \u2014 calculated as the amount of duties paid by U.S. companies divided by overall imports \u2014 has reached 10%, the highest in decades, and will likely keep rising for months.\n\u201cThose cost increases will be passed on to the consumer in some way, shape, or form,\u201d Bethune said. Some companies could return to \u201cshrinkflation,\u201d he added, in which they reduce the package size of a good while keeping the price the same.\nAnd companies that are absorbing tariff costs, which would cut into their profit margins, are less likely to hire new employees, he said.\nThe Federal Reserve may now be in a difficult spot.\nHiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced tariffs in April. The stalling out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank at its next meeting in September, and some Fed officials have raised concerns about the health of the job market. A rate cut by the Fed often, but not always, lowers borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans.\nEconomists are divided over how Fed officials will read the data in the coming months. Some argued that the worsening jobs picture will outweigh lingering inflation concerns and lead the Fed to cut at its next meeting in September. Yet some say that with core inflation notably above 2% and rising, the Fed will postpone that decision.\nChair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines \u2014 a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs.\nOn Tuesday, Trump attacked Powell again for not cutting rates and suggested he would allow a lawsuit against the Fed to proceed because of the rising costs of its extensive building renovation. It wasn\u2019t clear what lawsuit he was referring to.\nOn a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices ticked up 0.3%, a bit faster than the 0.2% in June.\nGas prices fell 2.2% from June to July and have plunged 9.5% from a year earlier, the government\u2019s report said. Grocery prices slipped 0.1% last month, though they are still 2.2% higher than a year ago.\nTariffs appeared to raise the cost of some imported items: Shoe prices jumped 1.4% from June to July, though they are still just 0.9% more expensive than a year ago. The cost of furniture leapt 0.9% in July and is 3.2% higher than a year earlier.\nCoffee costs nearly 15% more than a year earlier, mostly because of troubled harvests overseas, though steep duties on imports from Brazil could push those prices higher in the coming months. Nearly all U.S. coffee is imported.\nTuesday\u2019s data arrives at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported.\nThe president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer.\nAdding to the turmoil at BLS is a government hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did earlier this year. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable.\nSmaller companies are trying to avoid raising prices and some have turned to novel ways of raising funds.\nClothing maker Princess Awesome, which designs matching clothes for children and adults, has seen its costs jump 15% to 20% because of the tariffs. The company has joined a lawsuit seeking to block the duties. Rebecca Melsky, CEO and co-founder of the firm, says it is prohibitively expensive to make the cotton blend fabrics it uses in the United States.\nFor now, the company has instituted a \u201ctip jar\u201d on its website where it asks customers to help defray the cost of goods.\n\u201cWe have not across the board raised prices because of the tariffs -- yet,\u201d she said.\nTrump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven\u2019t fallen much since the levies were put in place.\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Yet the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear two-thirds of the burden, while foreign exporters pay a quarter and U.S. companies handle less than a tenth.\nMany large corporations are raising prices, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker. Most of those increases weren\u2019t in place for Tuesday\u2019s inflation report.\nConsumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices in August on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Walmart has also raised prices.\nAnd cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history.\n____\nAssociated Press Retail Writer Anne D\u2019Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report."

      "text": "Powell signals Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain\nPowell signals Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain\nJACKSON HOLE, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door ever so slightly to lowering a key interest rate in the coming months but gave no hint on the timing of a move and suggested the central bank will proceed cautiously as it continues to evaluate the impact of tariffs and other policies on the economy.\nIn a high-profile speech closely watched at the White House and on Wall Street, Powell said that there are risks of both rising unemployment and stubbornly higher inflation. Yet he suggested that with hiring sluggish, the job market could weaken further.\n\u201cThe shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\u201d he said, a reference to his concerns about weaker job gains and a more direct sign that the Fed is considering a rate cut than he has made in previous comments.\nStill, Powell\u2019s remarks suggest the Fed will proceed carefully in the coming months and will make its rate decisions based on how inflation and unemployment evolve. The Fed has three more meetings this year, including next month, in late October, and in December, and it\u2019s not clear whether the Fed will cut at all those meetings.\nAP correspondent Ed Donahue reports on prospects of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n\u201cThe stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,\u201d Powell said. That suggests the Fed will continue to evaluate jobs and inflation data as it decides whether to cut rates.\nThe stock market jumped in response to Powell\u2019s remarks, with the broad S&P 500 index rising 1.5% in midday trading.\n\u201cWe see Powell\u2019s remarks as consistent with our expectation of\u201d a quarter-point cut to the Fed\u2019s short-term rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients. The Fed\u2019s rate currently stands at 4.3%.\nPowell spoke with the Fed under unprecedented public scrutiny from the White House, as President Donald Trump has repeatedly insulted Powell and has urged him to cut rates, arguing there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and saying that a cut would lower the government\u2019s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.\nTrump also says a cut would boost the moribund housing market. A rate cut by the Fed often leads to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business borrowing, but it doesn\u2019t always.\nWhile Powell spoke, Trump elevated his attacks, telling reporters in Washington, D.C. that he would fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she did not step down over allegations from an administration official that she committed mortgage fraud.\nIf Cook is removed, that would give Trump an opportunity to put a loyalist on the Fed\u2019s governing board. The Fed has long been considered independent from day-to-day politics. The president can\u2019t fire a Fed governor over disagreements on interest rate policy, but he can do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is generally seen as malfeasance or neglect of duty.\nLater Friday, Trump told reporters, referring to Powell, \u201cWe call him too late for a reason. He should have cut them a year ago. He\u2019s too late.\u201d\nPowell spoke at the Fed\u2019s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a conference with about 100 academics, economists, and central bank officials from around the world. He was given a standing ovation before he spoke.\nCook, who is also attending the conference, declined to comment on the president\u2019s remarks.\nIn his remarks, the Fed chair underscored that tariffs are lifting inflation and could push it higher in the coming months.\n\u201cThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts,\u201d Powell said.\nInflation has crept higher in recent months though it is down from a peak of 9.1% three years ago. Tariffs have not spurred inflation as much as some economists worried, but they are starting to lift the prices of heavily imported goods such as furniture, toys, and shoes.\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year ago, above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%.\nPowell added that higher prices from tariffs could cause a one-time shift to prices, rather than an ongoing bout of inflation. Other Fed officials have said that is the most likely outcome and as a result the central bank can cut rates to boost the job market.\nThe Fed chair said it is largely up to the central bank to ensure that tariffs don\u2019t lead to sustained inflation.\n\u201cCome what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem,\u201d he said, suggesting deep rate cuts, as Trump has demanded, are unlikely.\nRegarding the job market, Powell noted that even as hiring has slowed sharply this year, the unemployment rate remains low. He added that with immigration falling sharply, fewer jobs are needed to keep unemployment in check.\nYet with hiring sluggish, the risks of a sharper downturn, with rising layoffs, has risen, Powell said.\nPowell also suggested the Fed would continue to set its interest-rate policy free from political pressure.\nFed officials \u201cwill make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach.\u201d\nPowell dedicated the second half of his speech to announcing changes to the Fed\u2019s policy framework that was issued in August 2020. The framework, which has been blamed for delaying the Fed\u2019s response to the pandemic inflation spike, provides guidelines on how the Fed would respond to changes in inflation and employment.\nIn 2020, after a decade of low inflation and low interest rates following the financial crisis and Great Recession in 2008-2009, the Fed changed its framework to allow inflation to top its 2% target temporarily, so that inflation would average 2% over time.\nAnd after unemployment fell to a half-century low in 2018, without pushing up inflation, the 2020 framework said that the Fed would focus only on \u201cshortfalls\u201d in employment, rather than \u201cdeviations.\u201d That meant it would cut rates if unemployment rose, but wouldn\u2019t necessarily raise them if it fell.\nThe Fed reviewed its framework this year and concluded that it was tied too closely to the pre-pandemic economy, which has since shifted. Inflation spiked to a four-decade high in 2022 and the Fed rapidly boosted interest rates afterward.\n\u201cA key objective has been to make sure that our framework is suitable across a broad range of economic conditions,\u201d Powell said."
