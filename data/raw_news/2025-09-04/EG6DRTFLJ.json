  "description": "Reese will join co-founders Alex Morgan, Sue Bird, Simone Manuel and Chloe Kim. The Chicago Sky forward joins Michelle Wie West as a new owner.",
  "content": "Angel Reese wants to be a part of the conversation on and off the court. That's why it was announced on Thursday, Sept. 4, that she will be the newest member of the TOGETHXR ownership group. The collective was founded in 2021 to advance the women\u2019s sports movement.\n\n\"It's huge for me,\" said Reese, a Chicago Sky forward and two-time WNBA All-Star. \"It means standing alongside women who aren\u2019t just legends in their sports, but real trailblazers in business and culture. They\u2019ve opened doors for so many of us, and now I get to lock arms with them and keep pushing things forward. That\u2019s powerful.\"\n\nReese will join with co-founders Alex Morgan, Sue Bird, Simone Manuel, and Chloe Kim who started the TOGETHXR collective to bolster women's sports by delivering authentic storytelling. They launched the trademarked Everyone Watches Women\u2019s Sports slogan. Reese is a member of TOGETHXR\u2019s newest wave of athletes, which also includes Michelle Wie West. She hopes to bring a new lens to the group.\n\n\"It\u2019s not so much about teaching them as it is about joining them, and bringing a fresh perspective into everything they\u2019ve already been doing so well,\" Reese told USA TODAY Sports. \"The foundation is here, and I\u2019m excited to help it keep building.\"\n\nReese has had a storied basketball career, winning a national championship with LSU in 2023 before being drafted No. 7 overall in the WNBA draft in 2024 by the Sky. She has been vocal in her career about her current team, asking for more investment from the ownership group in free agency in an article in the Chicago Tribune on Wednesday, Sept. 3. Her statements led her to apologize to her teammates but the message is, in some ways, what TOGETHXR is asking for, for women's sports to be at the forefront of change.\n\n\u201cTOGETHXR was built to challenge the system and prove what we\u2019ve always known: that women in sports set the standard, shift the story, and drive the conversations that matter,\" Bird said. \"Angel Reese is already doing that. She brings a confidence and leadership that not only defines her but adds to the legacy we\u2019re building as we continue to push women\u2019s sports forward.\u201d\n\nReese is a three-time BET Sportswoman of the Year, Harper\u2019s Bazaar\u2019s Icon of the year, Met Gala Host, and the first ever professional basketball player \u2013 male or female \u2013 to grace a solo cover of Vogue. She is an undeniable sports and style icon. Reese is leading the league in double-doubles (22), averaging 14.6 points, 12.6 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game this year.\n\n\"For me, it\u2019s about being part of something bigger than myself \u2014 something that represents what I believe in both on and off the court,\" Reese said. \"The co-founders have set the tone by dominating in their sports and using their voices to create real change. I want to bring that same energy, that same drive, and keep elevating women\u2019s sports to the next level.\"",

I really didn't intentionally mean to put down my teammates, because they've been through this with me throughout the whole year,\" Reese said. \"I want to apologize to my teammates, which I already have about the article and how it was misconstrued about what was said. And I just have to be better with my language.\"\nReese has averaged a team-high of 14.7 points, 12.6 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game this season for the Sky.\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news \u2014 fast.
