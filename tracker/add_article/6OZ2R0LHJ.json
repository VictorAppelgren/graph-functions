      "summary": "Apple is expected to unveil its iPhone 17 lineup in early September, with rumors indicating a new ultra‑thin Air model, a titanium‑framed Air, and a redesigned Pro chassis. The lineup will ship with the A19 chip, a 48‑MP rear camera, Dynamic Island, and a 2,800‑mAh battery on the Air, while the Pro models may feature an aluminum frame and a larger camera island. Analysts predict a $50 price hike across all models to offset rising component costs and tariffs, and the event will also showcase iOS 26 and new Apple Watch and AirPods releases. The launch is slated for September 9, with pre‑orders starting the following week.",
