Gregg Abbott in 2019.\n\nIn response to the ruling, O'Rourke put out a statement arguing that Paxton is trying to shut down his nonprofit \"because our volunteers fight for voting rights and free elections,\" which he called \"the kind of work that threatens the hold that Paxton, Trump, and Abbott have on power in Texas.\"\n\nGEORGE SOROS, BETO O'ROURKE BEHIND FUNDING FOR DEMS FLEEING TEXAS OVER GOP CONGRESSIONAL MAP\n\n\"They want to make examples out of those who fight so that others won't,\" O'Rourke added. \"Now Paxton\u2019s filed a restraining order to try to take us out of the fight. He wants to silence me and stop me from leading this organization. He wants to stop us from fighting Trump\u2019s attempt to steal the five congressional seats he needs to hang on to power. But I\u2019m not going anywhere. I plan on speaking at our rally to stop the power grab in Fort Worth tomorrow afternoon.\"\n\n\"Cry more, lib,\" Paxton said in response to O'Rourke's statement. \"You lost in court because you're breaking the law and deceiving Texans. We absolutely will make an example out of law breakers.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn addition to Powered By People, Paxton also launched an investigation into the Texas Majority PAC, which has also been accused of being a major funder of the fleeing Texas Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, O'Rourke filed his own lawsuit against Paxton in El Paso district court on Friday, The Texas Tribune reported. O'Rourke has accused Paxton of launching a \"fishing expedition\" and asked a judge to block Paxton's investigation into his nonprofit's practices.",

      "text": "Following reports that former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke's nonprofit Powered by People was helping fund Texas state Democrats' exodus out of the state to halt Republican redistricting efforts, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Wednesday announced he would be launching an investigation into the matter.\nTexas House Democrats fled the state this week in an attempt to stop Republican efforts to redraw the state's congressional maps. As a result, Texas House Republicans authorized civil arrest warrants for the absent lawmakers for depriving the House chamber of its ability to conduct official business. Meanwhile, Governor Greg Abbott subsequently called on the Texas Department of Public Safety to help arrest them. The civil arrest warrants, however, are only enforceable within state lines, and it is unclear how they will be executed.\nMeanwhile, amid the partisan battle, a report from The Texas Tribune on Tuesday claimed that O'Rourke's nonprofit founded in 2019 called Powered by People was among one of the main groups funding air transport, lodging, logistical support, and helping with the $500-per-day fines for the absent state lawmakers, citing anonymous sources involved with the fundraising efforts.\nWATCH: TRUMP SAYS FBI 'MAY HAVE TO' HELP TEXAS ROUND UP AWOL DEM LAWMAKERS\nThe report followed a warning issued by Abbott, indicating the fleeing state lawmakers could potentially be in felonious territory if they solicit, accept or agree to accept funds \"to assist in the violation of legislative duties or for purposes of skipping a vote.\"\n\"Any Democrat coward breaking the law by taking a Beto Bribe will be held accountable,\" Paxton said in a press release announcing the probe Wednesday. \"Texas cannot be bought.\"\nIn Paxton's announcement, he charged Powered by People with being one of the \"top groups\" providing financial assistance to Texas House Democrats who have left the state in order to obstruct Republicans' redistricting efforts, which they claim is essential to ensure racial gerrymandering is not taking place.\nAccording to Paxton, the financial assistance could amount to a violation of Texas bribery laws and potentially other laws governing campaign finance, \"coercion of a public servant, and abuse of office.\"\nIn response to the investigation, O'Rourke described Republicans in Texas as \"thugs\" attempting to \"steal our country,\" and accused Paxton of bribery himself. In 2023, the Texas state Senate acquitted Paxton of 16 articles of impeachment accusing Paxton of corruption and bribery.\n\"The guy impeached for bribery is going after the folks trying to stop the theft of five Congressional seats,\" O'Rourke said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"I encourage everyone to text FIGHT to 20377. Let\u2019s stop these thugs before they steal our country.\"\nGEORGE SOROS, BETO O'ROURKE BEHIND FUNDING FOR DEMS FLEEING TEXAS OVER GOP CONGRESSIONAL MAP\nPaxton is demanding documents and communications from Powered by People regarding the \"potentially unlawful activity,\" noting he is not afraid to take \"aggressive legal action\" against the Democrats who have obstructed legislative proceedings in Texas.\nThe Texas Tribune's report said that O'Rourke has been \"working the phones\" to encourage Texas lawmakers to leave the state to block the GOP's legislative efforts, citing an individual familiar with the discussions.\nPowered by People is also actively soliciting donations on its website to support the Democratic effort, promising potential donors that \"100% of your donation will go to supporting Texas Democrats in their fight against Trump's power grab.\"\nMeanwhile, the outlet reported that, in 2021, O'Rourke's group Powered by People reportedly helped raise $600,000 to help fund Texas House Democrats stay in the nation's capital as they tried a similar tactic at the time to obstruct Republican reforms of Texas state election laws.\nDuring a CNN interview Wednesday, O'Rourke was asked point-blank why he was helping Democrats flee Texas.\n\"We could see a similar scenario this time around. Is it worth it?\" CNN anchor Pamela Brown asked in reference to O'Rourke's 2021 efforts to obstruct Texas legislative proceedings.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Absolutely,\" O\u2019Rourke responded. \"If we fail, the consolidation of authoritarian power in America will be nearly unstoppable.\"\nBut Brown challenged O\u2019Rourke on whether the funds might be \"better spent\" aiding vulnerable Texans instead.\n\"We've seen it in the past\u2014they flee, but then inevitably they have to come back, right? You can't just stay out in perpetuity, and the governor can continue to call these special sessions,\" Brown said. \"Do you think the money could be better spent helping those folks you mentioned?\"\n\"I actually believe that they can stay out long enough to stop this steal in Texas,\" O'Rourke responded.\nFox News Digital's Anders Hagstrom and Kristine Parks contributed to this report."

Those clued into the fundraising efforts told the Tribune that they are confident they have found a way to legally distribute fundraising to lawmakers.\n\"Every dime of expense for this effort is being paid for lawfully,\" the Texas House Democratic Caucus told the outlet.\nTRUMP, REPUBLICANS RACE TO REDRAW TEXAS CONGRESSIONAL MAP AS DEMOCRATS THREATEN LEGAL WAR\nGov. Greg Abbott has already begun a legal process seeking to remove the \"ringleader\" of the derelict Democrats from office. The lawsuit targets State Rep. Gene Wu, chairman of the Texas House Democratic caucus, arguing his effort is violating the state's constitution.\n\"Representative Wu and the other Texas House Democrats have shown a willful refusal to return, and their absence for an indefinite period of time deprives the House of the quorum needed to meet and conduct business on behalf of Texans,\" Abbott said in a statement. \"Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences.\"\nThe Texas Supreme Court ordered Wu to respond to the lawsuit by Friday. Wu has yet to submit a court filing, but reacted to the press in a statement Tuesday night.\n\"Let me be unequivocal about my actions and my duty. When a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant,\" Wu said.\nThe Texas sergeant-at-arms was instructed to compel the return of the lawmakers earlier this week, \"under warrant of arrest, if necessary.\"\nPresident Donald Trump has even suggested that the FBI or other federal law enforcement may have to get involved.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"A lot of people have demanded they come back. You can\u2019t just sit it out. You have to go back. You have to fight it out. That\u2019s what elections are all about,\" he said."

I look forward to thoroughly reviewing all of the documents and communications obtained throughout this investigation. These jet-setting runaways have already lost public trust by abandoning our state, and Texans deserve to know if they received illegal bribes to do it,\" Paxton continued.\nPublic records indicated that the Powered by People PAC does get a significant number of smaller donations through individuals by platforms like ActBlue, but it\u2019s also received over hundreds of thousands from the progressive consulting firm Middle Seat, and $100,000 from Simone Coxe, a nonprofit leader who was a major funder of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s gubernatorial bid, according to the Texas Tribune.

Getting financial payouts under the table to abandon your legislative duties is bribery,\" Paxton said in a Thursday statement. \"Texas Majority PAC\u2019s actions seem to indicate that it may be using its Soros-funded resources to break the law and fund the illegal abandonment of public office. If that\u2019s the case as determined by this investigation, there will be a heavy price to pay.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital reached out to Powered by People PAC and the Texas Majority PAC for comment on the Paxton investigation. O\u2019Rourke responded to a post from Paxton on Wednesday, saying the Democrat is \"scared of accountability.\"\n\"Scared?

The group is paying for airfare, lodging, and assisting with the $500-per-day fines the lawmakers face for skipping the legislative session, according to the Texas Tribune.\nThe walkout by Texas Democrats has stalled the Republican-controlled state legislature from voting on new GOP-crafted congressional maps that would create five more right-leaning congressional districts ahead of the 2026 elections.\nDuring the Wednesday interview, CNN anchor Pamela Brown pointed out that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s group spent more than half a million dollars in 2021 to help Democrats flee the state to break quorum during a similar protest over a voting bill that ultimately passed.\n\"We could see a similar scenario this time around. Is it worth it?\" Brown asked.\n\"Absolutely,\" O\u2019Rourke responded. \"If we fail, the consolidation of authoritarian power in America will be nearly unstoppable.\"\nO\u2019Rourke argued that every American should be invested in helping the Texas Democrats, warning that a Republican congressional majority would \"roll out a royal red carpet for a Trump third term,\" including more ICE raids and \"more retribution and persecution and even violence for Trump\u2019s political opponents.\"\nBrown challenged O\u2019Rourke on whether the funds might be \"better spent\" aiding vulnerable Texans instead.\nNEWSOM VOWS TO FIGHT \u2018FIRE WITH FIRE\u2019 IN CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING BATTLE\n\"We've seen it in the past\u2014they flee, but then inevitably they have to come back, right?
