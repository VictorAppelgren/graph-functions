      "title": "New Air Force policy denies transgender troops hearings before they're discharged",
      "summary": "The U.S. Air Force has issued new guidance that automatically separates transgender service members with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, denying them early retirement benefits and revoking previously approved separations. The policy removes the possibility of impartial board hearings, prohibits recording proceedings, and treats the diagnosis as the sole basis for separation, raising legal concerns about due process. Transgender troops and their advocates argue the change undermines fairness, equates identity with performance, and could set a precedent for other branches. The move follows a Supreme Court decision that allowed a Trump-era ban on transgender service members to take effect while lawsuits continue to challenge the policy.",
