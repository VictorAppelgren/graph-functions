  "title": "Who Powers The AI Revolution\u2014Tech Giants, Utilities Or Both?",
  "description": "AI is driving a surge in electricity demand. Can utilities and tech giants work together to power data centers, or will the grid face a crisis?",
  "content": "Artificial intelligence may run on silicon chips, but its real fuel is electricity. After two decades of steady demand, AI and data centers are causing electricity consumption to soar, which will require utilities and tech giants to collaborate or confront each other. Either way, the aim is for the country to quickly upgrade its network to meet this AI-driven energy surge.\n\nCompanies like Meta, Oracle, and OpenAI are building large campuses that require reliable, continuous power. This expansion is testing the capacity of a grid designed for a slower digital economy and prompting utilities, regulators, and tech firms to reconsider their roles, partnerships, and investments.\n\n\u201cUtilities know how to capitalize the cost of building a transformer like the back of their hand, but can\u2019t capitalize a cloud subscription,\u201d Elizabeth Cook of the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies told the audience during a podcast in which we appeared together. That bias toward physical assets has historically limited investment in operations, data analytics, or predictive tools.\n\nUtilities have traditionally been low-risk, capital-heavy institutions. They invest in tangible infrastructure \u2014poles, wires, substations\u2014where costs can be depreciated and returns are assured. The utility industry states that its members often choose to be the first to come in second, implying they let more agile companies lead.\n\nTech giants can move quickly on high-risk, high-reward projects. Kim Getgen, founder of InnovationForce that hosted the podcast, notes that one hyperscaler can outspend the entire energy sector many times over\u2014by some estimates, as much as fortyfold.\n\nAI mega-data centers like Stargate, backed by Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI, are projected to generate $30 billion in annual revenue by 2028. These firms can build data centers in 12\u201318 months, while new power plants and transmission lines take at least five years to construct and connect. Why\u2019s that?\n\nUtilities make money by persuading commissions to approve capital spending, but operational investments\u2014like grid analytics\u2014generate lower returns. Tech companies, on the other hand, operate in a free market, giving them more flexibility to quickly allocate capital to meet fast-growing demand.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, data center electricity demand worldwide will increase by 130% by 2030. The Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory stated that data centers used about 4.4% of total U.S. electricity in 2023 and, depending on the growth of the rest of the economy, are projected to use between 6.7% and 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028. It cautions that this depends heavily on AI adoption rates and efficiency gains.\n\nThe U.S. faces an unprecedented challenge in expanding its grid. Jeff Weiss, executive chairman of Distributed Sun, explained during a virtual press event hosted by the United States Energy Association: \u201cWe need to triple the grid. Everything we do today takes 10 years. We need to figure out how to do it in two.\u201d In practice, that means tripling capacity\u2014not literally rebuilding three new grids. One-third of that new capacity will be needed just to support data centers.\n\nExisting generation, transmission, and workforce limits create bottlenecks. Supply chains for turbines, transformers, and other essential parts are insufficient for quick expansion. Regulatory permitting and interconnection procedures, designed for slower growth, cause further delays. High-powered transmission lines, which span multiple states, are extremely difficult to construct.\n\nDespite having speed and capital advantages, tech giants cannot simply replace utilities. They must follow the same permitting, siting, and interconnection rules. So, it doesn\u2019t matter if you are Google or the hometown utility. Meeting with stakeholders and complying with regulators is part of the process.\n\n\u201cYou have to deal with the same federal laws, the same citing, the same public support, and the same supply chain,\u201d says Tom Falcone, president of the Large Public Power Council, during the USEA event. \u201cWe deal with these issues in our social construct, in the laws and regulations that we have, and we all have to comply with them.\u201d\n\nHowever, the problem persists: data centers eager to run advanced AI models urgently need power. Utilities, limited by permitting timelines, supply chain issues, and workforce shortages, rarely meet that urgency. Derek Bentley, partner at Solomon Partners, highlighted the gap at the press event: \u201cYou can build a data center in 12 to 18 months. But a new power plant takes five years, plus years more to connect.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t just inconvenient; it\u2019s a fundamental mismatch between the 21st-century digital economy and a 20th-century grid. Progressive utilities are, therefore, working with data centers to develop hybrid solutions.\n\nIndeed, some data centers are colocating with natural gas or nuclear facilities, sometimes combined with renewables and battery storage to enhance scale and reliability. These behind-the-meter setups\u2014where power is generated on-site rather than solely from the grid\u2014are becoming more common. These partnerships enable data centers to access power quickly while maintaining grid stability.\n\nThat relieves the burden on the central network, which lowers the risk of blackouts and congestion. Still, for those data centers connected to the main grid\u2014in front of the meter\u2014it results in higher revenues for utilities.\n\n\u201cHyperscalers are more agile than many utilities, and they are more entrepreneurial and have the capital,\u201d says Clinton Vince, head of the U.S. energy practice at the Denton law firm, during the USEA event. \u201cI do think utilities have been working very well with hyperscalers, although the slower utilities will be disadvantaged tremendously.\u201d\n\nHe highlights Meta and Entergy, which are partnering in Louisiana to build major infrastructure supporting Meta\u2019s largest and newest data center, called Hyperion. It will be powered by both fossil fuels and renewable energy.\n\nHowever, the main criticism is that the regulatory system encourages stagnation. Bud Albright, senior adviser at the National AI Association, pointed out during the press event that \u201cThe regulatory format is inadequate today to do the kind of build-out that we need, whether it\u2019s behind the meter or in front of the meter.\u201d\n\nBeyond formal oversight, he adds that public opinion also plays a role. Communities wary of new data centers and transmission lines must understand the broader economic and technological benefits of these projects, from jobs to national competitiveness. Utilities and tech companies must prioritize education and outreach to demonstrate the benefits of their services.\n\nRate design is also under review. Pacific Gas & Electric, for example, requires data centers to pay initial interconnection costs and recover them later as the facility earns revenue. This method ensures costs are shared fairly and stops residential customers from subsidizing commercial loads.\n\n\u201cAffordability is top of mind for us,\u201d says Karen Omelas, director of large load program management for Pacific Gas & Electric. \u201cBut we see data centers as beneficial load.\u201d\n\nThe energy mix is shifting. Solar and battery storage are expanding rapidly. In fact, storage is becoming a crucial tool to meet peak demand, helping utilities and hyperscalers manage load efficiently. Still, reliable, dispatchable power remains essential. Natural gas fulfills much of this need, while coal is dirtier, expensive, and increasingly irrelevant for electricity production.\n\nAll of this highlights a bigger truth: the ongoing transformation is a once-in-a-lifetime event. It\u2019s not about who has the largest balance sheet or who is the most nimble. It\u2019s about collaboration at scale. Utilities need to adopt new tools, rethink their operational models, and partner with the very tech companies they might have once seen as rivals. Meanwhile, tech firms must accept that building computers is one thing; powering them responsibly, reliably, and safely for the masses is another.\n\nFor policymakers, the challenge remains just as urgent. Innovation in regulation, faster permitting processes, and public education are essential to prevent congestion that could impede the digital economy. Without action, the infrastructure supporting AI\u2014and the industries it drives\u2014are at risk. And it won\u2019t be because of a lack of creativity or ambition, but because of slow, outdated rules.\n\n\n\n The AI revolution isn\u2019t just about chips or advances in machine learning. It\u2019s about wires and power plants. It\u2019s also about the invisible links connecting millions of servers to millions of homes. AI\u2019s ultimate limitation is less about computer intelligence and much more about how fast the grid can expand.",

      "text": "AI is set to drive surging electricity demand from data centres while offering the potential to transform how the energy sector works\nNews\nMajor new IEA report brings groundbreaking data and analysis to one of the most pressing and least understood energy issues today, exploring AI\u2019s wide range of potential impacts\nArtificial intelligence has the potential to transform the energy sector in the coming decade, driving a surge in electricity demand from data centres around the world while also unlocking significant opportunities to cut costs, enhance competitiveness and reduce emissions, according to a major new report from the IEA.\nThe IEA\u2019s special report Energy and AI, out today, offers the most comprehensive, data-driven global analysis to date on the growing connections between energy and AI. The report draws on new datasets and extensive consultation with policy makers, the tech sector, the energy industry and international experts. It projects that electricity demand from data centres worldwide is set to more than double by 2030 to around 945 terawatt-hours (TWh), slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today. AI will be the most significant driver of this increase, with electricity demand from AI-optimised data centres projected to more than quadruple by 2030.\nIn the United States, power consumption by data centres is on course to account for almost half of the growth in electricity demand between now and 2030. Driven by AI use, the US economy is set to consume more electricity in 2030 for processing data than for manufacturing all energy-intensive goods combined, including aluminium, steel, cement and chemicals. In advanced economies more broadly, data centres are projected to drive more than 20% of the growth in electricity demand between now and 2030, putting the power sector in those economies back on a growth footing after years of stagnating or declining demand in many of them.\nA diverse range of energy sources will be tapped to meet data centres\u2019 rising electricity needs, according to the report \u2013 though renewables and natural gas are set to take the lead due to their cost-competitiveness and availability in key markets.\n\u201cAI is one of the biggest stories in the energy world today \u2013 but until now, policy makers and markets lacked the tools to fully understand the wide-ranging impacts,\u201d said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. \u201cGlobal electricity demand from data centres is set to more than double over the next five years, consuming as much electricity by 2030 as the whole of Japan does today. The effects will be particularly strong in some countries. For example, in the United States, data centres are on course to account for almost half of the growth in electricity demand; in Japan, more than half; and in Malaysia, as much as one-fifth.\u201d\nThe report emphasises the significant uncertainties that remain, from the macroeconomic outlook to how quickly AI will be adopted. It also notes questions over how capable and productive AI will become, how fast efficiency improvements will occur, and whether bottlenecks in the energy sector can be resolved.\nAI could intensify some energy security strains while helping to address others, according to the report. Cyberattacks on energy utilities have tripled in the past four years and become more sophisticated because of AI. At the same time, AI is becoming a critical tool for energy companies to defend against such attacks. Another energy security concern relates to the expanding demand for critical minerals used in the equipment in the data centres that power AI. The report provides first-of-its-kind estimates of demand from data centres for critical minerals, whose global supply is today highly concentrated.\nWhile the increase in electricity demand for data centres is set to drive up emissions, this increase will be small in the context of the overall energy sector and could potentially be offset by emissions reductions enabled by AI if adoption of the technology is widespread, according to the report. Additionally, as AI becomes increasingly integral to scientific discovery, the report finds that it could accelerate innovation in energy technologies such as batteries and solar PV.\n\u201cWith the rise of AI, the energy sector is at the forefront of one of the most important technological revolutions of our time,\u201d Dr Birol said. \u201cAI is a tool, potentially an incredibly powerful one, but it is up to us \u2013 our societies, governments and companies \u2013 how we use it. The IEA will continue to provide the data, analysis and forums for dialogue to help policy makers and other stakeholders navigate the path ahead as the energy sector shapes the future of AI \u2013 and AI shapes the future of energy.\u201d\nAccording to the report, countries that want to benefit from the potential of AI need to quickly accelerate new investments in electricity generation and grids, improve the efficiency and flexibility of data centres, and strengthen the dialogue between policy makers, the tech sector and the energy industry.\nThe report is part of the IEA\u2019s expanding work analysing the deepening ties between energy and AI. It builds on the Global Conference on Energy and AI the IEA hosted in December 2024 \u2013 the largest conference on this topic to date \u2013 and the Agency\u2019s contributions to the AI Action Summit chaired by France and India in February. The IEA will also soon launch a new Observatory on Energy, AI and Data Centres, which will gather the most comprehensive and recent data worldwide on AI\u2019s electricity needs, in addition to tracking cutting-edge AI applications across the energy sector.\nAlongside the report, the IEA is publishing a new AI agent to help readers interact with its findings. The AI agent is available on the report\u2019s main web page and answers questions on the report\u2019s contents in an easy and conversational manner."

      "text": "Adapted from a Dec. 20, 2024 Department of Energy news release\nA recent report produced by the Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), which outlines the energy use of data centers from 2014 to 2028, estimates that data center load growth has tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple by 2028.\nThe 2024 Report on U.S. Data Center Energy Use, which was announced by the U.S. Department of Energy on Dec. 20, also found that U.S. electricity demand is projected to account for data center expansion and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, domestic manufacturing growth, and electrification of different industries.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much difference in the industry between when we looked at it in 2016 and when we look at it now,\u201d said the report\u2019s lead researcher, Arman Shehabi, a staff scientist in Berkeley Lab\u2019s Energy Technologies Area. \u201cBy showing what the energy use is and, more importantly, what\u2019s causing the growth in energy use, it helps us think about what opportunities there are for efficiencies.\u201d\nAmong the report\u2019s key findings:\n- Data centers consumed about 4.4% of total U.S. electricity in 2023 and, depending upon how much the rest of the economy grows, are expected to consume between 6.7 and 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028.\n- The total data center electricity usage climbed from 58 TWh in 2014 to 176 TWh in 2023 and is estimated to increase between 325 to 580 TWh by 2028.\n- Between 2017 and 2023, data-center power demand more than doubled, largely due to the growth in AI servers.\n- AI requires increasingly powerful chips and intense cooling systems, driving energy demand growth.\nThe Department of Energy announcement outlines several DOE strategies for meeting data center energy demand, including enabling data center flexibility through onsite power generation, storage solutions and leveraging energy community opportunities, engaging with stakeholders on innovative rate structures, and commercializing key enabling technologies.\nThe 2024 Report on U.S. Data Center Energy Use was produced by Berkeley Lab\u2019s Center of Expertise for Energy Efficiency in Data Centers and funded through DOE\u2019s Industrial Efficiency and Decarbonization Office.\n###\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) is committed to groundbreaking research focused on discovery science and solutions for abundant and reliable energy supplies.
