  "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Faces Chipped Finish Complaints\u2014Which Models Are Affected?",
  "description": "Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is facing complaints as users report chipped finishes. Some users question the quality control for the $2,000 flagship foldable.",
  "content": "Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 has been out for just a month, but early adopters are already complaining about the same issues that last year's Z Fold 6 experienced.\n\nSeveral owners complain that the anodized coating of the high-end foldable phone is chipping off, occasionally within days of receiving it, even though it costs well over $2,000.\n\nAndroid spotted the problem on Reddit, where members posted photos of the Blue Shadow version with paint flakes along the power button, USB-C port, and side rails. Owners are adamant that the issue wasn't caused by drops, scratches, or abusive use.\n\nOne user claimed that he never dropped his phone, but it still got a chop. He assumed that the paint was very soft and could fade out easily. Another user complained that his phone had a chip in the earphone.\n\nThe problem is uncannily identical to the controversy surrounding the Z Fold 6 in 2024, when several customers complained of peeling frames. Samsung then accused third-party chargers of being the cause, positing that poorly grounded adapters led to current leakage that compromised the anodized layer. The company was sternly advising customers to stick with official power bricks alone.\n\nIn the same thread, the grievances contradict that explanation. Some Z Fold 7 owners report using no third-party chargers at all, yet the finish still wore off. Others dispute that anodization should not be on the verge of failure under typical use if it's properly done during manufacturing.\n\nOne detailed article speculated that the aluminum frame might not have been treated correctly, which would mean the coating cannot adhere well.\n\nMost of the incident reports involve the Blue Shadow model, with a few others reporting Jet Black. Silver Shadow is not affected yet, according to Android Police. While not numerous, the increasing incident reports point to Samsung's quality control inconsistencies, particularly worrying for a phone promoted as the epitome of foldable innovation.\n\nWhat Can Samsung Do to Address the Issue?\n\nSamsung's customer support reaction has been uneven. Some consumers report that they were informed that cosmetic damage is not warranted, as the chipping does not affect performance.\n\nOthers reported service centers scheduling pickups to assess the flaw, with some of those cases being escalated to Samsung's corporate team for additional review.\n\nFor consumers who paid thousands for a flagship fold, chipped paint is more than a superficial defect. People are aware that this kind of issue erodes trust in the durability and build quality of the device.\n\nWith Chinese competitors' foldables gaining popularity fast, Samsung will lose market share if it doesn't fix long-term quality concerns.\n\nIf you're having doubts about purchasing the affected phone, you can wait for the release of the Galaxy S25 FE.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nFirst Z Fold 6, now Galaxy Z Fold 7 owners complain of paint peeling\n22 hours ago\n- Some Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 owners have reported chipped paint on their phones.\n- Many owners claimed that they haven\u2019t dropped their devices.\n- It\u2019s possible that chargers are affecting the anodized body of the Z Fold 7, much like the Z Fold 6.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has been on the market for just over a month now, and we praised the foldable phone in our review. However, some owners are discovering a rather weird hardware issue that we previously saw on the Z Fold 6.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nSome Galaxy Z Fold 7 owners on Reddit have reported paint chips on their phones. The issue doesn\u2019t seem to be restricted to a specific color scheme. There also seems to be a common thread here, as these owners claim that they haven\u2019t dropped their devices. Check out a few images below.\nA Samsung support page for the Z Fold 6 suggests that a poorly grounded third-party charger can affect the phone\u2019s anodized aluminum body:\nUsing a high-speed third-party charger that isn\u2019t properly grounded can lead to leakage currents that deteriorate the anodization (a protective and aesthetic finish on metal surfaces) of your Galaxy device. This may result in the delamination of the paint. To ensure the longevity and appearance of your device, we strongly recommend using only official Samsung chargers, which are specifically designed to prevent such issues.\nHowever, at least one affected Redditor reported using a 25W Samsung charger. This suggests that Samsung\u2019s paint process could be to blame, or that the company\u2019s own chargers aren\u2019t up to the task.\nIn any event, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve seen some users complain about chipped paint on the Galaxy Z Fold series, as some Fold 6 owners reported this issue too. So it\u2019s a real shame that Samsung hasn\u2019t adequately addressed this issue in 2025.\nWe\u2019ve asked Samsung for comment on this latest issue and will update the article as soon as the company issues a response.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "New rumors are popping up regarding an upcoming Samsung device that will modify the Galaxy Z Fold 6 foldable device into a 'Slim' version of the device, and the sources claim its launch date is near. This latest change will transform Samsung's flagship foldable device into a significantly thinner version, with many improvements coming to the device dubbed as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition.\nThe massive leaks are also sharing that this development will put Samsung in a reinforced position where it will havean edge over market rivals in the foldable niche, especially with the rise of new folding smartphones at present.\nSamsung to Bring a 'Slim' Version For Its Galaxy Z Fold 6\nSamMobile shared a new report that expands more on the rumor behind Samsung's plans to launch a new foldable smartphone towards the end of October, debuting a slimmer version of its Galaxy Z Fold 6. The latest details also unveiled that Samsung has already set its release date for the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition by next Friday, October 25.\nIt was not revealed if Samsung will have a dedicated launch event for when it introduces the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition to users, but rumor mongers believe that it is coming later this month.\nEvan Blass, another prolific leaker, recently unveiled the renders of the rumored Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition, as well as the thinner size dimensions of the device. When folded, the new Galaxy Z Fold is only 10.6mm thick, and when unfolded, it only registers 4.9mm.\nSamsung is Looking to Fight Against Chinese Rivals\nSamsung will bring a 6.5-inch cover screen and its internal, foldable screen offers a wide 8-inch display, and no other details were revealed regarding the device. It was revealed by the reports that Samsung is planning to release a new foldable smartphone as soon as possible to go against its Chinese rivals who are growing in popularity in the industry.\nThat being said, there is still no information on its price point and availability in the global markets.\nThe Foldable Smartphones in the Tech World\nMotorola's revamp of its Razr flip phone is one of the earliest iterations of the modern foldable smartphone industry, with the popular brand's comeback also helping it gain massive popularity worldwide. That being said the South Korean tech conglomerate, Samsung, is also among the earliest to debut the world's first foldable smartphone with the Galaxy Z Fold.\nHowever, the company credited with debuting the first commercially-available foldable smartphone worldwide was the Royole FlexPai from the Chinese technology company based in the United States.\nThe Android-based foldable smartphones that were led by Samsung and Motorola spawned different companies joining this development and debuting their versions of the niche mobile phones, with Chinese companies slowly taking control of the market.\nSamsung may be one of the proprietors that helped popularize the foldable niche but it is facing a massive rivalry in the industry as China's developments are offering cheaper and more feature-packed devices. That being said, Samsung is looking to diversify and expand more of its foldable offers, and rumors are it is setting up for a late October launch of its Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

      "text": "With Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked conference scheduled for July 9, excitement about the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 has hit a fever pitch.\nRecent leaks revealed practically every side of the next-generation foldables. Aside from its \"slim\" feature, the new report features tech upgrades with a comprehensive preview of Samsung's most cutting-edge smartphones ever.\nGalaxy Z Fold 7 Sets New Benchmark for Slim Foldables\nAs per a fresh report from popular leaker Setsuna Digital on Weibo, Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be its thinnest and lightest foldable yet. Surprisingly, its design enhancements and a competitive advantage over competitors such as the Oppo Find N5 and Vivo X Fold 5 will show up.\nThe leaked specifications indicate the Z Fold 7 will be just 8.9mm thick when folded and a staggering 4.2mm thick when unfolded\u2014a whopping drop from the Fold 6's 12.1mm and 5.6mm thickness.\nIf this is true, Samsung will have removed a record-breaking 3.2mm of thickness from its foldable flagship in a single generation.\nThat extremely thin form factor will also have a weight reduction: the Z Fold 7 is said to weigh just 215g, 24g lighter than the Z Fold 6, and lighter than the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nThe Fold 7 isn't skimping on screen size despite its thinner body. It's said to feature a 6.5-inch cover display and a generous 8-inch inner foldable screen, taking premium mobile multitasking to new heights.\nHigh-End Camera and Performance Enhancements On the Way\nSamsung is likely to load up the Galaxy Z Fold 7 with some serious hardware enhancements. Android Police noted that the leaked information includes:\n- Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor\n- 200MP main rear camera\n- 10MP front camera with a 100-degree angle of view\n- A new glass ceramic rear panel for added toughness\nSamsung is doubling down on power, portability, and premium looks with its foldable, based on the leak.\nGalaxy Z Flip 7 Also Streamlines With Larger Battery, Displays\nFar from being left behind, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is also undergoing a significant transformation. The leak indicates the clamshell-folding smartphone will be 13.7mm when folded and 6.5mm when unfolded, an upgrade over the Z Flip 6's 14.9mm and 6.9mm.\nAs a pleasant surprise, Samsung is also increasing the battery capacity to 4,300mAh\u2014a 300mAh bump without adding bulk.\nThe Flip 7 is also receiving upgraded screens:\n- 4.1-inch cover screen with a 1.25mm bezel\n- 6.9-inch internal screen with a 21:9 aspect ratio\n- 120Hz refresh rate and 2,600 nits peak brightness on both screens\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

      "text": "There's a new leak indicating Samsung's Galaxy S26 Ultra will prioritize design minimalism and charging improvements, leaving battery capacity intact. According to Weibo leaker, Ice Universe, Samsung intends to have the Galaxy S26 Ultra less than 8mm thick, a significant reduction from the Galaxy S25 Ultra's 8.2mm thickness.\nEven with the slimmer design, the phone will allegedly carry the same 5,000mAh battery Samsung used in earlier Ultra models. This might be a letdown for users looking for a power upgrade, as against flagships from rivals, such as the OnePlus 13, which will have bigger batteries due to silicon-carbon technology.\nGalaxy S26 Edge Might Bring Improved Battery Innovation\nNotably, the leak also suggests that the Galaxy S26 Edge will gain from newer battery technology, which would enable Samsung to add capacity without losing thinness. It is not clear why the same strategy isn't being used on the Ultra version, particularly considering the need for improved endurance in high-end flagships.\nThis design tradeoff implies the S26 Ultra might once again lag behind the competition in battery life, despite delivering high-end performance and construction quality. Samsung is more concerned with form and engineering refinement than the pursuit of spec-sheet dominance.\n60W Fast Charging to Counter Small Battery Size\nOne major upgrade revealed in the leak is support for 60W wired charging, up from the original 45W. According to Android Police, this should significantly reduce charging time, helping make up for the unchanged battery size.\nBased on current Samsung charging patterns, the entire 60W output might be triggered only when the battery is close to empty. This might constrain the effect of the upgrade for people who constantly top up during the day instead of charging from scratch.\nSnapdragon 8 Elite 2 'For Galaxy' to Power the S26 Lineup\nSamsung will equip its Galaxy devices with a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 chip, reportedly clocked at 4.74GHz\u2014faster than the standard 4.47GHz.\nBuilt on TSMC's new node, the chip promises better thermal efficiency and lower power consumption, especially during light tasks. This should give the S26 Ultra a noticeable performance boost in both benchmarks and daily use, highlighting Samsung's deepening collaboration with Qualcomm on flagship-optimized silicon.\nSamsung Bets on Design and AI, Not Bigger Specs\nDespite falling behind some rivals on brute specs such as battery capacity, Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra has become the company's top-selling Ultra device over the recent past. Slim design, premium build quality, and extreme AI integration appear to have trumped the absence of eye-catching hardware enhancements.\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra appears ready to double down on that recipe\u2014delivering polished looks, better charging, and bleeding-edge performance, while avoiding the urge to pump up the specs war.\nSamsung seems to prioritize user experience and design consistency over chasing raw specs.\nRelated Article: Samsung Galaxy F56 Teardown Shows It's Super Easy to Repair\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

More importantly, the news of this tri-fold smartphone's development officially came from Roh, being its first confirmation after years of being mentioned only in rumors.\nThis tri-fold smartphone could offer a larger main screen than the traditional bi-fold smartphone, opening up two more sides of display for users, similar to what Huawei delivered with its Mate XT from last year.\nHowever, there are still no official release dates for the device, and this could also be delayed.\nRead Also: Samsung's Rumored 'G Fold' Tri-Fold Phone Is Not Releasing Globally\u2014Only Coming to 2 Countries\nSamsung 'G Fold' and the Latest Foldables\nThe Samsung Galaxy G Fold would join the growing foldable smartphones by the South Korean tech giant, which recently expanded its lineup following the Unpacked event.\nWhile the showcase featured the two expected smartphones namely the Galaxy Z Flip7 and the Galaxy Z Fold7, the company also unveiled a Galaxy Flip7 FE (Fan Edition) which is its more cost-effective version than the main release.\nThe Tri-Fold Smartphone Market Rises\nThe world is not yet fully adopting foldable smartphones as there is still a massive uncertainty in their longevity, durability, and brands that offer them. However, there are already significant innovations in the niche, especially with tri-fold phones.\nBack in 2021, a leak about Oppo's plans on its foldable developments gave the world a glimpse into its development of a triple-foldable smartphone, being among the earliest to introduce such a device in the market.\nFast forward three years, Huawei unveiled one of the earliest smartphones featuring tri-foldable screens with the Mate XT. Before the smartphone made it to the market, it saw a whopping 3.6 million pre-orders in China alone, highlighting the significant interest in this new niche device.\nSoon after, Samsung was rumored to be working on a tri-fold device that was dubbed the \"G Fold\" to be the next contender to Huawei's Mate XT.\nIt has only been several months since news of a triple-foldable device is coming from Samsung, but the latest revelation of its executive confirms the smartphone in question is coming sooner than expected.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

      "text": "Samsung has not yet announced information about Galaxy S25 FE, but an early leaked listing suggests it's going to be released soon. The successor of Galaxy S24 FE has recently been spotted MediaMarkt listing in Portugal.\nWhile it's now deleted, a Dutch website was able to write down its specs.\nGalaxy S25 FE Display and Design\nBased on the leak, the Galaxy S25 FE has a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen with clear 1080x2340 pixels. The display also accommodates a silky smooth 120Hz refresh rate, which guarantees smooth navigation and a better gaming experience. To safeguard against scratches and drops, Samsung is outfitting the phone with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+, according to NieuweMobiel.\nIn terms of design, the phone is slender with a thickness of 7.4 mm and weighs 190 grams with a sleek yet sturdy build. The leaked listing had only the Navy Blue variant, although it's very probable that Samsung will offer additional colors upon release.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 FE Performance\nInternally, the Galaxy S25 FE will utilize the Exynos 2400 chipset coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.\nAlthough the listing had just a single storage option, Samsung is likely to release other options to cater to various user demands. These hardware components are expected to offer robust multitasking capabilities, quicker app opening, and optimal power management.\nCamera Capabilities\nPhotography enthusiasts will appreciate a great deal with the S25 FE's triple camera system at the back. There is a 50MP primary lens with OIS, a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and an 8MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS.\nA front-facing 12MP selfie snapper guarantees sharp, high-resolution photos for video calls and selfies. Such specifications make the Galaxy S25 FE a strong challenger in Samsung's family, especially for smartphone photographers.\nBattery and Charging Capabilities\nAccording to GSM Arena, the Galaxy S25 FE has a 4,900mAh battery, marginally less than Samsung's top-end S series but still powerful enough for day-to-day use. The device supports 45W wired fast charging and 15W wireless charging, making it possible for users to charge their devices quickly with minimal downtime.\nAI and Software Upgrades\nAs per Samsung's new plan, S25 FE will be equipped with AI-infused features such as Gemini Live to boost the user experience. These products will offer more intelligent photography suggestions, enhanced voice assistance, and more efficient on-device optimization.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

      "text": "Samsung's latest foldables have only been on shelves for a month, but one is already picking up an unwelcome bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from last year\u2019s Z Fold 6. As Android Authority drew our attention to, multiple Galaxy Z Fold 7 owners are reporting that the paint \u2014 or more accurately, the anodized finish \u2014 is chipping off their $2,000-plus devices. And in most cases, they swear it\u2019s not from drops or abuse.\nA curious case of chipped paint\nSuspiciously similar to last year's\nThis is what the edge of the Blue Shadow model should look like with no flaking paint.\nReports started surfacing on Reddit nearly three weeks ago. Multiple posts and comments have emerged containing photos of the aluminum frame showing flakes of missing finish near the power button, around the USB-C port, and along the side rails. One owner, who claims to have \u201cbabied my phone the day I purchased it,\u201d said the coating started peeling despite only ever using Samsung\u2019s 25W charger and a high-quality case. Another said they woke up to what looked like a speck of lint, only to discover it was a bare patch of aluminum after the finish chipped away further.\nIf this sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it is. The Fold 6 had a nearly identical controversy last year. That prompted Samsung to issue support documentation suggesting poorly grounded third-party chargers could degrade the anodization on its foldables. The company recommended using only first-party power bricks, warning that current leakage from non-OEM chargers might corrode the protective surface.\nHowever, the latest complaints complicate that narrative. Several users say they only used Samsung\u2019s official charger, while others point out that the anodized layer shouldn\u2019t fail under normal circumstances at all. One particularly detailed comment argued that the aluminum wasn\u2019t treated properly during manufacturing, meaning the finish simply wasn\u2019t bonded to the frame the way it should have been.\nWhat's being done about the finicky anodization?\nMost reports center on Blue Shadow, with few on Jetblack, and seemingly none on Silver Shadow.\nSamsung\u2019s customer service responses seem mixed. A few users report being told cosmetic damage isn\u2019t covered under warranty since it doesn\u2019t affect performance. Others, like a Z Fold 7 buyer in Denmark, say Samsung arranged a pickup to evaluate whether the defect qualifies for repair or replacement. In at least one case, a service center escalated the issue to corporate for review.\nStill, for a phone that starts at over $2,000, spontaneous paint flaking is more than a minor annoyance. It\u2019s a quality control problem. It also risks undermining confidence in Samsung\u2019s premium foldables at a time when Chinese brands are heating up the competition.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Samsung for comment and will update if the company provides an official response. In the meantime, if you\u2019re the proud owner of a new Z Fold 7, try not to get caught up staring too closely at the frame."

  "argos_summary": "Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold\u202f7 has sparked complaints as users report the anodized finish chipping off within weeks of purchase, primarily on the Blue Shadow model. The issue mirrors last year\u2019s Z Fold\u202f6 controversy, yet many owners claim they used only official Samsung chargers, suggesting a manufacturing defect rather than charger-induced damage. Samsung\u2019s response has been mixed, with some customers told cosmetic damage is not covered while others receive service center pickups. The recurring quality control problem threatens consumer confidence and could erode Samsung\u2019s premium foldable market share amid rising competition from Chinese rivals.",
