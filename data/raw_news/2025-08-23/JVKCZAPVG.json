  "description": "The 1970s buddy cop series \"Starsky and Hutch\" and 2004 follow-up movie featured a 1976 Ford Gran Torino  painted orange with a large, bold, white graphic.",
  "content": "If you've seen the TV series \"Starsky & Hutch\" that ran from 1975 through 1979, you'll remember the red and white Ford Gran Torino that was driven by the titular police detectives. While the bold appearance made the car look fast even while standing still, most of the dozen or so used for filming were somewhat underpowered. The 351 cubic inch V8 that went inside some of Ford's coolest cars produced a rather anemic 154 horsepower and was mated to a three-speed automatic transmission in the Gran Torino. Paul Michael Glaser \u2014 who played Detective Dave Starsky in the series \u2014 took an immediate dislike to the car, calling it a \"striped tomato.\" Glaser took out his negative feelings about the Gran Torino from behind the wheel, taking every opportunity to bash it into obstacles and against curbs.\n\nHe was driving the camera-ready but underpowered hero cars in most shots, but the stunt cars had 400-plus cubic inch V8s and rear axles that had been re-geared for better acceleration. But by the time the show aired, new emissions control and fuel economy regulations had forced most buyers into smaller cars, and Ford dumped the entire Torino line after 1976. That year's model with the 351-inch V8 weighed more than 25 pounds for each available horsepower, making it a lumbering but slick-looking brute.",

      "text": "Why Did Ford Discontinue The Gran Torino?\nIntroduced as a luxury-oriented, budget-friendly midsize car for the 1972 model year, the Gran Torino and its sister cars \u2014 the Gran Torino Sport and the original Torino (in production since 1968) \u2014 represented Ford's premiere affordable midsize coupe of the early to mid-1970s. However, if there's one thing to say about this era, it wasn't very kind to American cars.\nThe Malaise Era struck the auto industry hard in 1973, following the oil crisis caused by the Yom Kippur War embargo, leading to radical course corrections in automotive development. These changes resulted in long-lasting shifts within both what consumers demanded and what American automakers could feasibly provide in such a short timespan \u2014 a fact which claimed many American models throughout the 1970s, the Gran Torino among them in 1976. Ford never published any statement concerning its reasons for discontinuing the Torino line, but we can infer quite a lot about why it failed.\nIn short, the Ford Torino was discontinued due to three interrelated reasons: A shift towards the compact segment, the Torino's large and somewhat archaic body style, and a lack of investment due to Ford's shifting priorities to follow market trends. To explore these factors deeper, I'll focus on anecdotal evidence and the effects the era had upon larger square bodies in general, as well as draw upon my own years of research into automotive development in this era.\nFord Gran Torino: An acceptable car at the worst possible time\nNamed for the Italian city of Turin, the Ford Torino started life in 1968, marketed as a more luxurious Fairlane. The Torino saw outstanding success in its initial years, leading Ford to essentially swapping the Fairlane and Torino names in 1970 before discontinuing the Fairlane entirely. Once among the fastest muscle cars, the Torino underwent three generations, with the one we're concerned with lasting from 1972 to 1976 \u2014 the Gran Torino trim.\nWith wheelbases of either 114\" or 118\", the Gran Torino's platform represented one of the largest \"midsize\" cars ever marketed, with the 1976 wagon boasting a whopping total length of 223.2 inches. For context, that's about four inches longer than a late-'90s Chevy Suburban. The problem wasn't its length, nor its looks: The 2-door 1973 model year was particularly handsome, for instance. Rather, it was the timeframe Ford introduced it.\nThis vehicle debuted just one year prior to one of the most dramatic years in automotive history, and this extends beyond just the oil crisis. Ford had only just completely redesigned the Torino with a brand-new fascia \u2014 development time invalidated when the U.S. government mandated the infamous \"5-mile-per-hour bumper,\" retroactively canceling decades of bumper development.\nThis meant that Ford had to sink even more money into redesigning its cars again, with the Torino becoming something far different in comparison to its original 1972 configuration. On top of that, new emissions regulations impacted the entire industry; necessitating not only a body redesign, but a complete overhaul of the engines as well. This set the stage for the downfall of the American full-size barge in the mid-1970s \u2014 including the Gran Torino.\nMid-size platform with full-size problems\nThough marketed as a midsize, the re-re-designed 1973 Gran Torino was really a full-size car, with at least a 114\" wheelbase (depending on configuration), and tipping the scales at 3,677 pounds minimum, exceeding 2 tons. As such, it directly competed with the similarly-proportioned Monte Carlo favorably, with Ford producing 459,057 1973 Torino models according to VIN data recorded on GranTorinoSport.org \u2014 of which 407,070 were Gran Torinos \u2014 against the Monte Carlo's 233,689 units. However, these numbers wouldn't last into the Malaise Era, with Torino sales plummeting by almost half to 253,096 units by 1976.\nThis trend continued throughout the American automotive industry due to power figures and gas mileage plummeting to record lows \u2014 whereas the adolescent Japanese import market boomed. Honda, for example, didn't require a catalytic converter on its newly-introduced Civic because its Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion (CVCC) system was so emissions-friendly that it didn't even need one to comply with federal regulations.\nSuch vehicles easily outperformed their larger and thirstier American counterparts (including the Torino's 13 MPG city and 19 highway in 1976), directly leading to dwindling sales numbers in the full-size market. These cars retained positions as dominant luxury offerings, but the Gran Torino was marketed in a more budget-friendly segment while retaining full-size proportions; effectively appealing to neither market as well as a dedicated platform (which Ford offered with the Thunderbird and Mustang II, respectively).\nThis effectively sealed the fate of the Gran Torino and others like it; its sales gradually falling in favor of more practical, less expensive, and far more fuel-efficient offerings. Such offerings only improved year after year, effectively leading to death by a thousand cuts \u2014 or a thousand sales.\nShifting customer sensibilities\nThe Torino shared its platform with four other vehicles: the Ford Ranchero, Elite, Mercury Cyclone, and Mercury Montego, none of which sold particularly well and were generally marketed outside of their own bracket by Ford. Take the Elite, for instance, which Ford advertised as being \"like a Thunderbird,\" Ford's full-size luxury offering at the time. Even the Gran Torino itself \u2014 in the mid-1970s, Ford targeted its midsize (but really full-size) against far smaller and more economical competitors like the Datsun 510 and Toyota Corona.\nIn other words, the marketing around the Torino's platform touted it as either being essentially a budget-version of a more aspirational car, or a (rather large) economy car \u2014 and that was for a very specific reason. Namely, because the customer base who purchased the likes of the Gran Torino migrated to other models to keep up with the changing times. This even occurred within Ford itself, leading the company to offer directly competing models internally. Again, let's refer back to the Mustang II. The very first line of its original brochure states, \"the right car at the right time,\" and Ford marketed it by leaning heavily into its combination of luxury and economy \u2014 just like the Gran Torino, with the opening paragraph of its 1976 brochure extolling its \"good mileage\" (in massive quotes).\nThis mirrored the general automotive culture at the time, namely the move towards either compacts or personal luxury cars. Of course, to Ford, selling cars was the priority. So rather than lose Torino customers to foreign automakers, Ford offered two appealing alternatives. If a Torino owner wanted a similar feel but with more economy, they could purchase a Mustang II. Or, if they wanted to retain the luxury image and size, go with a Thunderbird instead.\nA lack in developmental investment\nLet's look at the development history of something far more successful: The Mustang II. Ford had already produced a compact, cheap economy car before the oil crisis even hit: The infamous Pinto. All the 1974 Mustang II did was take the Pinto's underpinnings and stretch it out to fit a bigger engine. This meant Ford wasted little development costs in re-engineering the wheel. It was the perfect car at the perfect time. Ultimately, the Mustang II sold like absolute hotcakes, and likely single-handedly rescued the Mustang name from drowning in the Malaise lagoon.\nOn the other hand, Ford offered little concessions to its Torino line outside of improving upon its luxury aspects. Unlike the Mustang II, the Torino was a body-on-frame design, so it couldn't feasibly be shrunken down anymore without simply fitting the name on a smaller car. Seeing as Ford already had the Mustang II, it would need to build an entirely new platform from scratch just for the Torino, which simply wouldn't have made much fiscal sense.\nAs such, the Torino became something of a black sheep, a position evident in its \"Starsky & Hutch\" appearance \u2014 Ford didn't even want the Torino in the role at first, the iconic car being its second choice. Further, what started life as a muscle car gradually but heavily deviated into the mundane, much to its own detriment.\nBy the mid-1970s, Ford didn't even list the Torino's power figures in its brochure anymore, for instance. Yes, the late-stage Gran Torino was one of pop culture's most famous Fords thanks to its television presence, with a special commemorative edition to boot. But it was a shadow of its former self, and with sales slumping, Ford had no reason to continue its downward spiral.\nA failed platform and its slow demise\nAt last, we come to the Torino's final years. By now, we've established that the full-size car segment suffered heavily under the weight of the oil crisis and its subsequent regulations. This drove customers to seek smaller, more economical alternatives, which caused the boom of the import market and midsize segment. And while considered \"midsize,\" the Torino was functionally as large as a full-size LTD, and not actually that much cheaper, either.\nLastly, the Torino's development and marketing focused more heavily on the luxury end of the spectrum, especially with the Elite, which was advertised as a budget-friendly Thunderbird alternative. This move was very much deliberate, as the personal luxury segment shot up to 22% of domestic automotive sales by 1977, as opposed to just 3% ten years earlier. Meanwhile, full-size luxury car sales dropped dramatically by comparison. This trend ultimately led to the eventual death of the traditional square-body in the 1980s.\nThese factors most directly contributed to the Torino's inevitable discontinuation and replacement, with Ford retaining the platform for use in the brand-new 1977 LTD II and facelifted Thunderbird. Both of these replacements bear luxury-oriented names predating the Torino itself, but funnily enough, neither car lasted particularly long, with Ford retiring the platform just three years later in 1979 when the second oil crisis hit. Ford marketed the LTD II against its own LTD as a budget-friendly alternative; the (frankly still massive) LTD II similarly failed to meet expectations, and the model ended along with the platform itself. Meanwhile, the Thunderbird received yet another platform, its third in less than a decade, before finally downsizing as a luxury Fox body in 1983."

      "text": "5 Of The Coolest Cars Equipped With Ford's 351 V8 Engine\nThe 351 V8 engines are some of the best-known motors made by Ford, but even Ford fans might not know they came in three distinct types: Windsor, Cleveland, and Modified. The engines may be the same size, but in other ways they couldn't be more different.\nThe Windsor engine started life, reasonably enough, in Windsor, Ontario. The Canadian plant is probably the most widely used of the 351s, appearing in a range of Ford models, from muscle cars like the Mustang to classic Bronco and F-150 trucks. The Cleveland engine, made in its namesake Ohio city, was built for speed and is now the rarest of the 351s, making it a major target for collectors. The \"Modified\" engine split the difference, representing Ford's attempt to deliver Windsor reliability with Cleveland power. For the purposes of this article, we'll be focusing on the Windsor and Cleveland.\nEach engine has its own story. The Windsor is everywhere. The Cleveland was built for speed. The cars that came equipped with them each have stories of their own. Here are 5 of the coolest rides with Ford's 351 Windsor or Cleveland engines.\n1977-1979 Ford Thunderbird\nThe Ford Thunderbird, or \"T-Bird,\" started in 1955 to take on the Chevrolet Corvette. Originally a sleek two-seater with a potent V8 engine, in 1958 Ford redesigned it into a four-seat luxury model. This new look turned heads and got the T-Bird Motor Trend's 1958 Car of the Year award. The Thunderbird settled nicely into Ford's lineup as a high-power, high-comfort luxury beast and would stay there for years, undergoing only iterative changes. In 1977, however, Ford took on new environmental regulations and a fuel-conscious marketplace, stripping back the T-Bird by nearly a thousand pounds. It was this version of the T-Bird that boasted the Cleveland V8 as a high-performance option. The standard was still the 302 cubic-inch V8.\nEquipped with the 351 V8 engine, the Thunderbird was recognized for its performance, while the car's design highlighted personal luxury for Ford fans. Its plush interior could easily accommodate four adults, and the T-top option available in certain models added to its appeal.\nFord's strategy to downsize the Thunderbird without compromising on luxury paid off, making the late '70s models some of the most successful in the Thunderbird lineage. The introduction of the 351 V8 engine played a pivotal role in this success, too, hitting a perfect balance of performance and style.\n[Featured image by Sicnag via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY 2.0 ]\nFord Torino\nThe Ford Torino, first made in 1968, may have begun life as a fancified Fairlane, but it quickly established its own place among Ford thoroughbreds. The Torino was incredibly flexible, coming with a variety of powertrains from economical straight-6 engines to powerful V8s. The latter sported a 351 Cleveland engine and rode it to glory. There's even a 1968 Ford Torino in Charlotte's NASCAR Hall of Fame.\nAs it evolved through its generations, the Torino's design and engineering received significant updates that kept it at the forefront of the muscle car era. By the time the third generation rolled off the assembly line in 1972, the Torino had a more muscular and refined aesthetic, made evident by a restyled grille, increased chrome trim, and the introduction of models like the Gran Torino Elite in 1974. This particular year emphasized V8 exclusivity, dropping smaller engines in favor of performance-focused powertrains that ranged up to 255 horsepower. Inside, it was roomy and comfortable, with nice seats and a good-looking dashboard.\nThe Torino is also a classic of pop culture. Starsky and Hutch fought crime from their 1976 Ford Gran Torino, bright red with a white side stripe. Even though the actors in the show didn't love maneuvering the massive Gran Torino around the \"Starsky and Hutch\" set, the car is still a '70s icon.\nDe Tomaso Pantera\nBack in the '70s, Alejandro De Tomaso, a race car driver turned carmaker from Argentina, challenged the supercar dominance of Ferrari and Lamborghini with a moderately priced competitor. The result was a sleek, visually pleasing sports car called the Pantera. That supercar power came straight from a 351 Cleveland V8.\nThe Pantera was designed by an Argentinian and made in Italy, but it had the heart of an American muscle car. The specs were impressive for its time, with early models pushing around 330 horsepower, enabling a sprint from 0 to 60 mph in just 5.5 seconds. It wasn't just straight-line performance that made the Pantera a great car. The Pantera was built to move, equipped with a ZF 5 speed manual transmission, independent suspension, and disc brakes on all four wheels.\nThe Pantera faced challenges over the years, like the oil crisis in the '70s and new emission rules for cars, but the car kept evolving and adapting. De Tomaso made different versions of the Pantera, each improving on the last. The Pantera's legacy is not just in the limited numbers produced or the speed records it set, but in its appeal to collectors and enthusiasts who appreciate the mix of style, performance, and international collaboration. If you're looking for the coolest car with the 351 V8, this might be it.\nFord Mustang Boss 351\nIn the early '70s, despite the widespread popularity of muscle cars, the market was facing turbulence. Dwindling fuel supplies and tighter environmental regulations made manufacturers rethink their high-performance lousy-mileage gas guzzlers. Despite this, Ford managed to make the Boss 351 Mustang a beast of a car for one last hurrah.\nThis Mustang used the 351 Cleveland engine, and its debut in the 1971 Mustang Boss 351 was nothing short of spectacular, with 330 horsepower and 370 lb-ft of torque. The car was capable of quarter-mile sprints in the low 14-second range at speeds touching 100 mph. The Boss 351 looked cool, too, with a unique grille, stripes down the side, and special hood vents. It also had a tough suspension system and a manual transmission that made it fun to drive.\nDespite the strengths of the Boss 351, it came at a time when Ford was stepping back from racing, leaving it in an awkward position. Born from Ford's racing ambitions but destined for the street, the Boss 351 marked a unique chapter in Mustang's storied history and represented one of the coolest versions of the iconic muscle car.\n[Featured image by Sicnag via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and scaled | CC BY 2.0 ]\n1969 Mercury Cougar\nBorn out of the desire for a more upscale version of the popular Mustang, the Mercury Cougar came onto the scene in 1967. Unlike the Mustang, the Cougar was pitched as a sophisticated ride offering as much luxury as muscle. The first Cougar was a hit, surpassing market expectations with sales that challenged the mighty Mustang. That early success cemented the Cougar as a classic American muscle car worth every penny.\nThe Cougar design, which included features like hideaway headlights and sequential turn signals, was not the only cool thing about the car. Its performance matched its looks. Initially equipped with the 289 V8 engine, the Cougar soon embraced the more powerful 351 Windsor in 1969, followed by both Cleveland and Windsor versions of the 351 the next year. This shift to the 351 V8 engines improved the Cougar's performance, allowing it to stand toe-to-toe with other muscle cars of the era, including its cousin, the Mustang.\nThe Cougar was also praised for its driving dynamics, striking a balance between comfort and handling rare for the time. This was the muscle car lover's chance to cruise in style, something the Cougar's plush interior and longer wheelbase made possible. The Cougar naturally evolved and changed over time, but the early models of the car, especially those equipped with the 351 V8 engine, remain highly sought after by collectors and car enthusiasts alike."
