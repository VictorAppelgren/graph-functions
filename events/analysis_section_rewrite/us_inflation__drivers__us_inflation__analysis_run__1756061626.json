      "feedback": "The analysis has a solid base-case Regime A framing and a plausible Ford cash-flow anchor, but the causal chain from macro to market pricing to equity value is underspecified, the horizon/scenario structure is muddled (no clear base vs. risk path or probabilistic framing), and several numeric anchors are either truncated, inconsistently cited, or not tied to explicit triggers; to reach world-class quality, restructure into a tight, first-principles scenario with a labeled base-case (Regime A) and a risk/regime (Regime B) path, map macro-policy, oil, tariffs, and flows to Ford’s earnings power and then to valuation, and anchor every claim to a source ID. Actions: (1) formalize two-scenario architecture with explicit probabilities and time horizons, and a concise causal chain: inflation target convergence and productivity-led capex drive real rates toward neutral, which sets discount-rate and equity valuation; (2) restate Ford metrics (EV losses ≈ $1.3B, adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%, ROIC ≈ 10.1%, yield ≈ 5.2%, forward P/E ≈ 10.3) as a cash-flow power anchor, and connect them to a defensible free-cash-flow/DCF read rather than treating them as static footnotes; cite each figure to 22PL3Q360 or 65UUBU0OR as applicable; (3) make oil-and-inflation transmission explicit: link Regime A Brent ≈ mid-60s and WTI ≈ low-60s to inflation and rate paths, with the stated supply/demand path (+2.5 mbpd in 2025, +1.9 in 2026) and refinery runs (85.6 mbpd in 2025; 83.6–84.0 in 2025–26) tied to a quantified inflation/deflation impulse; cite J99EM2TPZ and T1QE6JPIX; (4) codify near-term catalysts and triggers with thresholds: Fed guidance/inflation prints; AI/semiconductor capex announcements; Ford quarterly earnings trajectory; oil-price moves to key thresholds; tariff updates (90-day extension) and 10Y yield moves; assign time-window (e.g., next 4–8 quarters) and probabilities; (5) specify invalidation rules: Regime B triggers if inflation remains materially above target for two consecutive prints, wage growth accelerates beyond a stated delta, or tariff/geo-political shifts derail the productivity narrative; (6) tighten ACMR and reconcile any internal inconsistencies (the ACMR long-horizon anchor and 2025 revenue ~$900m, gross margin ≈ 4% appear underspecified or truncated); confirm and cite with IDs; (7) ensure every factual assertion has a corresponding source citation and avoid mixing conflicting paths, then present a concise five-point watch-list of decisive signals with clear thresholds and a date window; (8) tighten prose to remove repetition of Ford metrics and oil-path restatements, and maintain a single, coherent thread that a) macro drives rates, b) policy shifts tilt toward productivity sectors, c) cash-generation anchors drive multiples, and d) the stated risks determine scenario fragility.",
