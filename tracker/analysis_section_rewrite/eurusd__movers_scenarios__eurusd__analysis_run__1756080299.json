      "feedback": "The draft shows a plausible multi-regime frame but needs a tighter, first-principles causal chain and auditable triggers; explicitly map Gemini‑driven AI features and seven‑year update cadence to durable CAPEX in memory/imaging silicon and to measurable device-refresh dynamics, rather than relying on implicit narrative, and ensure each line’s “What to watch” ties to concrete metrics (e.g., replacement rate, memory pricing, charging profiles) drawn from the cited sources (5S9GJV2O3, HWGNUP2XG, UVEQ2SJ0W). Introduce explicit, auditable triggers and invalidation conditions with numeric thresholds (for example, AI adoption or feature cadence crossing a defined share within a window; CPI pass-through from tariff moves exceeding a set bps; a Yemen/shipping shock persisting beyond a threshold) so a regime shift is testable, and attach the corresponding source IDs to those facts (9JYRMPXB0, I2SJU04DF, W3CN6QOQR, 4693XL4AP). Calibrate probabilities as defensible ranges tied to the material (e.g., 40–70% rather than single points) and document the rationale behind each line’s probability with a brief signal from the cited IDs; ensure both the Up and Down lines stay strictly within the 4-item, one-sentence-per-line format and preserve the exact schema (Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability%). In addition, tighten horizon discipline so the 3–6, 0–3, and 12–24 month windows map to distinct drivers (AI-driven upgrade cycle, policy/financing regimes, geopolitical/shipping risks) and clearly mark invalidation paths (Regime A failing to persist, tariff shocks intensifying, or a regime shift toward B/C) with explicit sources; finally, audit for cross-source conflicts and harmonize them into a single coherent causal chain anchored to the core anchors (5S9GJV2O3, 9JYRMPXB0, I2SJU04DF, UVEQ2SJ0W, NL5YYTLF2, STBVARD8F, OGK8WLL69, SGB2PAZGK).",
