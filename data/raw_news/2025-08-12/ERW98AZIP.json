  "title": "Opponents of White Stadium project unveil new alternative design, with updated cost of $64.6 million",
  "description": "The nonprofit Emerald Necklace Conservancy and a coalition of residents continue to fight against the city's plan to redevelop White Stadium for Boston Public Schools students in partnership with a new, professional women's soccer team.",
  "content": "The conservancy proposes a roughly 5,000-seat facility, compared to the 11,000-seat stadium of the current project. It would still include a grass field, track, scoreboard, gym, and locker rooms, but have fewer amenities \u2014 no media and medical rooms or a beer garden.\n\nThe Emerald Necklace Conservancy\u2019s latest plan would cost the city about $64.6 million , the group said, and could serve as a scaled-back upgrade for the dilapidated stadium that the city could fund on its own, without partnering with a new professional women\u2019s soccer team.\n\nOpponents of the city of Boston\u2019s redevelopment of White Stadium unveiled an updated alternative proposal for the facility on Tuesday, in their latest push for the city to opt for a different, less-expensive design for the Franklin Park site.\n\nThe $64.6 million figure is more than double the $29 million price tag of the alternative design the nonprofit pitched in January. The group hired the architectural design firm Landing Studio to develop the proposal, and the construction cost estimate company Vermeulens Inc. to come up with the price breakdown. A spokesperson for the Emerald Necklace Conservancy declined to say how much the nonprofit paid for either service.\n\nThe conservancy, along with a coalition of residents that call themselves the Franklin Park Defenders, has fought for more than a year to halt the city\u2019s plan to overhaul the stadium with Boston Legacy Football Club as a partner, for use by Boston Public Schools students and for team games. The project, which is already underway and has become a political flashpoint in this year\u2019s mayoral election, has an estimated price tag of $200 million, with the city on the hook for at least $91 million of that cost.\n\nMayor Michelle Wu says the project is a rare opportunity to offer BPS students access to a world-class sports facility, while splitting the cost with a private entity. Critics counter that the park and surrounding neighborhoods are not a suitable location for a professional sports stadium, and that the collaboration would allow a private company to profit off of public parkland.\n\nKaren Mauney-Brodek, president of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, on Tuesday attributed the higher cost of the nonprofit\u2019s updated plan to the completed demolition on the site. The group\u2019s original proposal had included renovating, instead of completely rebuilding, parts of the original structure, she said.\n\nEven with the increased price tag, the nonprofit\u2019s design would be cheaper for the city than the current project with Boston Legacy FC, she said.\n\n\u201cAmid massive cost overruns, very challenging, potentially unsolvable transportation concerns and continued legal challenges, it\u2019s clear that the Boston football plans are on shaky ground,\u201d Mauney-Brodek said. \u201cWe believe there\u2019s plenty of time to pursue a better option, a more affordable, fully public White Stadium in Franklin Park that prioritizes the Boston Public Schools and the community uses.\u201d\n\nCity officials previously dismissed the nonprofit\u2019s $29 million proposal for the stadium as unrealistic given the high cost of construction. Wu repeated that criticism on Tuesday, in response to the latest proposal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a real proposal or figure to say that at this point we can start all over, or even that you can deliver anything close to what\u2019s being talked about, for the kinds of figures that are being tossed out,\u201d Wu said to reporters at an unrelated event.\n\nThe city\u2019s share of the project\u2019s price tag is likely to exceed $91 million due to rising costs of materials, Wu said last month. She has not offered an updated estimate, saying the figure will not be available until later in the year after construction bids are finalized.\n\n\u201cWe are moving forward,\u201d Wu said Tuesday. \u201cWe are on track with construction, and it\u2019s going to be a spectacular opportunity for our young people to really, finally have the experience of the city investing in them and giving them the facilities they deserve as a city-wide hub for athletics, for open space, and for community building.\u201d\n\nThe controversy over the project has divided community members and different advocacy groups.\n\nRickie Thompson, president of the nonprofit Franklin Park Coalition, emphasized his organization\u2019s strong support for Wu\u2019s plan for the site Tuesday. He said it would end \u201cyears of disinvestment in the park and the crumbling stadium.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, the stadium closes at 4 p.m. on weekdays; under the new plan, it will be open seven days a week, morning to evening \u2014 more than doubling public access,\u201c Thompson said in a statement. \u201cIf opponents get their way, we will break another promise to BPS students and the communities of Franklin Park. That is unacceptable. It is time to move forward.\u201d\n\nTwo BPS mothers who gathered more than 600 signatures in support of Wu\u2019s White Stadium project also criticized the leadership of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy on Tuesday, calling on them to either resign or end \u201ctheir tired sabotage campaign\u201d against the project.\n\n\u201cAfter more than two years of public meetings and their resounding defeat in court, it is time for [Emerald Necklace Conservancy] to accept that the renovation is happening,\u201d said BPS parents Dot Fennell and Beth Santos.\n\nBut other community members said the Emerald Necklace Conservancy\u2019s option would be better for the communities surrounding the park, and that it responds to residents\u2019 concerns about the city\u2019s project.\n\n\u201cThis updated design is a relief: open, inviting, exciting, and much more in line with the legacy of Franklin Park,\u201d said Priscilla Andrade, a BPS parent who lives near Franklin Park. \u201cIt fosters interaction within the community and offers the opportunity to put BPS Athletics front and center instead of sidelined by the needs of the national league.\u201d\n\nLouis Elisa, a founder of the Franklin Park Coalition and president of the Garrison-Trotter Neighborhood Association, called the nonprofit\u2019s design a \u201cpositive alternative\u201d that would benefit all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to come to the table with something other than a complaint,\u201d Elisa said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say what we don\u2019t like, it\u2019s important to say what we do like, and then have the support and resources to show people that there can be, there should be, a working alternative that meets the needs of our communities and families and children, our public schools and athletic programs.\u201d\n\nNiki Griswold can be reached at niki.griswold@globe.com.

      "text": "OUR SUPPORTERS\nDemolition has begun, but the fight is NOT over. We support the renovation and redevelopment of White Stadium to benefit BPS student-athletes, surrounding communities, and all\npark users. Now is the time to take action!\nThe demolition of White Stadium and parts of Franklin Park has already begun, making it more urgent than ever to take action. The City of Boston and Boston Unity Soccer Partners LLC have pushed forward with their expansion and renovation plans for White Stadium without proper environmental review or meaningful community input. This reckless approach threatens the park\u2019s historic and ecological integrity, as well as the well-being of the communities that rely on it. Now is the time to stand up and defend Franklin Park before it\u2019s too late!\n30 local organizations have joined the Franklin Park Defenders by signing our Statement of Principles:\n-\nArborwayMatters\n-\nThe Black Lotus Cooperative Inc.\n-\nCoalition for Regionwide Services Beyond Franklin Park (CORES)\n-\nContemporations, Inc.\n-\nThe Enviro Show\n-\nFACTS Association/Xchange\n-\nFriends of Melnea Cass Boulevard\n-\nFriends of the Notch Forest\n-\nGarden Club of the Back Bay\n-\nGarrison Trotter Neighborhood Council\n-\nGreene & Greene Realty\n-\nMattapan Food & Fitness Coalition\n-\nMethunion Manor Cooperative Corporation\n-\nPower of Skirts Collective\n-\nRoxbury Neighborhood Council\n-\nTrees as a Public Good Network\n-\nThe Trustees Collaborative for Parks & Open Space\n-\nThe Urban Biodiversity Project\nThey are joined by 505 individuals who have signed the Statement of Principles\u2014view the latest list of Defenders below:\n(updated regularly)\nLATEST NEWS\nADVOCACY OVERVIEW\n-\nFranklin Park Defenders support renovation of White Stadium for the exclusive use of Boston Public Schools (BPS) school children and the public.\n-\nFranklin Park Defenders oppose private development at Franklin Park\u2019s White Stadium.\n-\nFranklin Park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, is one of the preeminent parks in America, the jewel of Boston\u2019s Emerald Necklace, and a national registered landmark.\n-\nWhite Stadium is a historic, beloved facility that has been neglected by the City for decades.\n-\nThe Franklin Park Action Plan, approved in 2023, addressed numerous investment priorities, including improvements to White Stadium.\n-\nThe City of Boston is advocating for the expenditure of at least $91M of taxpayer money to demolish White Stadium and erect a much larger stadium.\n-\nFranklin Park Defenders believe that the proposed new stadium would have a harmful effect on abutting neighborhoods and Franklin Park itself.\nThe City of Boston recently signed a 30-year lease on White Stadium, and adjourning parkland, to Boston Unity Soccer Partners LLC, a for-profit private company. This would permit BUSP to build private facilities/uses including offices, luxury private boxes, restaurants, and shops. It would displace Boston Public School (BPS) students and the general public for 20 games and 20 practices on Fridays and Saturdays from April-November and eliminate BPS regular season football games.\nThis proposal has dismissed necessary legal and regulatory processes for projects in protected open space and environmental justice* communities, including The Public Land and Protection Act (Article 97), Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA), and others. It does not follow the Franklin Park Action Plan, developed in collaboration with the community. This project has raised objection and deep concern with many community leaders, advocates and members of the public.\n*Franklin Park is a geographic, recreational and environmental justice HUB of Boston's oldest, largest and most vulnerable minority and low-wealth census-tracks. Reeling from decades of deep municipal neglect and disinvestment, residents today continue to be harmed and displaced through individual, cumulative, and disproportionately adverse projects, which often include unfair community engagement practices and do not follow existing state and municipal legal protections."

      "text": "Opponents of the Wu administration\u2019s redevelopment of White Stadium fought back on Wednesday by pitching a much less expensive alternative for the run-down Franklin Park sports facility.\nThe nonprofit Emerald Necklace Conservancy hired construction cost consultant Vermeulens to draw up a plan that the conservancy argues is more in keeping with the park\u2019s character. The firm pegs the cost of the alternate plan at $29 million, compared to a much more extensive project proposed by the Wu administration and Boston Unity Soccer Partners, the owners of a new pro women\u2019s soccer team. That proposal is estimated to cost upwards of $200 million, with the city expected to contribute at least $91 million.\nThe new proposal drew a quick rebuke from city officials, who first learned of the conservancy plan from the Globe, saying the estimates included in the new report are untethered from the true cost of building public projects in Boston today.\nThe plan from the conservancy, whose mission is to act as a steward for the Emerald Necklace group of parks, would level the east grandstand, already ruined by fire damage, and replace it with some bench seating built into a small hillside, while fully renovating the west grandstand; White Stadium would feature more than 5,000 seats in this scenario. The city\u2019s plan, meanwhile, would build a new east grandstand with facilities for Boston Public Schools coaches and athletes, and the National Women\u2019s Soccer League team would build a new west grandstand for its use, leaving the stadium with around 11,000 seats. Both projects would replace the stadium\u2019s running track with a new one.\nAdvertisement\nThe conservancy and a group of like-minded advocates have been tangling with the city and the team in Suffolk Superior Court court over the stadium; they sued to block the project last February, with a potential trial set for March. These critics argue that a scaled-down proposal geared solely for student-athletes and the community is a better approach, in part because it avoids the loss of many nearby trees and doesn\u2019t prevent football teams from playing there for most of the fall. They hope to use these new plans to further that argument in public discussions, with a community meeting scheduled for Feb. 6 to take feedback on their new \u201cpublic park concept\u201d for the stadium.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe wanted to show there are other ways to do this,\u201d said Karen Mauney-Brodek, the conservancy\u2019s president. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the contrast and the choices we\u2019re making.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the conservancy said the cost estimates were based on comparable sports projects in the Northeast region, with pricing tied to the Boston construction market for a 2026 procurement. The estimator did not work with city officials to get site-specific details and instead relied on details in a 2013 concept study for a similar White Stadium reconstruction.\nMayor Michelle Wu argues the partnership with the pro soccer team is the most viable way to renovate the dilapidated, 1940s-era stadium for city residents and students, a longtime goal that evaded her predecessors in the mayor\u2019s office. The team\u2019s ownership will pay for the majority of the project, as well as ongoing maintenance. The city\u2019s proposed renovations would provide for significantly expanded access throughout the year to students and the public, although football games there would be limited to the end of the season. And the project has won the support of the Franklin Park Coalition, a nonprofit that organizes events and advocates for the park.\nAdvertisement\nBoston Unity Soccer Partners signed a lease for the property with the city last month, and would like to start the team, currently known as BOS Nation FC, playing there in time for the beginning of the 2026 NWSL season, an ambitious construction timeline. (Globe chief executive Linda Henry is a minority investor in the team ownership group.)\nA city spokesperson repudiated the conservancy report in a brief statement, calling it a \u201cwork of fiction\u201d and urging the conservancy to \u201cend the lawsuit and misleading attacks on the project and instead work with us to deliver on a promise for BPS student athletes and all community members that use and love Franklin Park.\u201d\nBoston Unity Soccer Partners responded to the conservancy report by emphasizing the positive elements of the team\u2019s project, calling it a \u201cgenerational opportunity to invest in Franklin Park and its surrounding neighborhoods, delivering increased city revenue, establishing a Franklin Park Preservation Fund, providing a $500K annual community grant for local organizations, and ensuring proper maintenance to prevent White Stadium from falling into disrepair again.\u201d\nJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com.

      "text": "City officials have given the Boston Legacy Football Club ownership a six-week extension to wrap up financing for its portion of the White Stadium redevelopment in Franklin Park.\nMayor Michelle Wu\u2019s administration had set an Aug. 1 financing deadline as part of a legal document signed with team controlling manager Jennifer Epstein in December, when the two sides agreed to a lease to redevelop the west grandstand area of the crumbling stadium for the nascent team\u2019s use. As part of the project, the city would rebuild the recently demolished east grandstand, which was rendered unusable by a long-ago fire.\nWu said she sees the public-private partnership as crucial to rehabbing the stadium on behalf of the city\u2019s student-athletes, a goal that has long vexed her predecessors in City Hall. But she faces criticism over the escalating price tag and potential effects on the park and surrounding neighborhoods.\nThe women\u2019s pro soccer team plans to take on debt to help pay for its portion, but it\u2019s taking more time to line that up than initially expected. On July 25, the Boston school department agreed to amend the original performance guarantee with the team, changing the financing deadline from Aug. 1 to Sept. 15. Epstein signed the amendment, as did schools superintendent Mary Skipper.\nAdvertisement\nBoth sides said the project still has solid momentum. Boston Legacy issued a statement saying that the \u201cteam\u2019s institutional financing partner remains fully committed, and the extension to September 15 reflects a typical timeline for finalizing major construction.\u201d (The new National Women\u2019s Soccer League team plans to play its first season, in 2026, at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough.)\nAdvertisement\nLikewise, a city spokesperson described the White Stadium project as \u201cadvancing rapidly\u201d and \u201cwell underway,\u201d and said that the city is starting some utility upgrade work as well as bidding out millions of dollars in foundation work.\nIn another sign of progress, Boston Legacy designated a general contractor for its portion last week: Bond Brothers, the same firm overseeing the city\u2019s work on the project. Boston Legacy has already spent $5 million at the site from a $25 million escrow account it established with the city, including for installing structural support for the stadium\u2019s historic clamshell wall and procuring structural steel and canopy systems; the city has spent $11.3 million so far.\n\u201cBond has been part of Boston\u2019s fabric for over 118 years, and working with the City and Legacy to build an important piece of our collective next chapter is a great honor,\u201d Bond project executive Peter Roche said in a prepared statement.\nAn updated project cost still has not been disclosed, though the city\u2019s portion will likely exceed $100 million. (The last official estimate of $91 million for the city\u2019s contribution emerged last fall, and Wu says she won\u2019t know the final cost until later this year.) The team has agreed to pay for more than half of the total.\nThe stadium\u2019s escalating cost has become a flashpoint in the ongoing mayor\u2019s race, as challenger Josh Kraft continues to argue that a stadium project built solely for student-athletes would be a better use of taxpayer dollars. The project also faces another likely court battle with the Emerald Necklace Conservancy and its allies, who lost a lawsuit aimed at blocking the project in March but have signaled that they plan to appeal. Meanwhile, the Franklin Park Coalition, another nonprofit that acts as a park steward, supports the project.\nAdvertisement\nJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com. Follow him @jonchesto."

      "text": "Boston mayoral candidate Josh Kraft Monday morning lambasted Mayor Michelle Wu over her administration\u2019s handling of the White Stadium redevelopment, painting the city\u2019s executive as incapable of containing what he claimed were ballooning taxpayer costs for the project.\nSpecifically, Kraft charged that taxpayers are now on the hook for an estimated $170 million worth of the project\u2019s costs, a figure significantly higher than previously reported estimates. Just last July, for instance, the Boston Globe reported the city had earmarked $50 million for the project.\nThat price tag for taxpayers swelled to about $91 million, the last figure the Wu administration publicly shared, as the total cost of the project grew to around $200 million by December. Officials, though, acknowledged that figure could change as construction contracts are finalized.\nAdvertisement\nStanding in front of a remaining wall of the stadium, fenced in by a construction site, Kraft said Monday Wu was overseeing \u201cthe least transparent City Hall in generations.\u201d\n\u201cYou need to stop hiding the ball and tell the taxpayers what the actual cost is going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a catastrophic failure of city management.\u201d\nKraft said his campaign had received the $170 million figure from City Hall insiders, but did not name names. Asked what is driving costs up, he told reporters they should \u201ccheck with the city.\u201d\nWu\u2019s mayoral campaign did not refute the $170 million figure in a statement to the Globe. Wu\u2019s City Hall press office, meanwhile, provided previously released project cost estimates Monday totaling more than $90 million.\nAdvertisement\nIn a statement, a Wu campaign spokesperson said Kraft \u201ckeeps attacking White Stadium to distract from his family\u2019s massive conflict of interest and their refusal to negotiate a fair deal with the people of Boston to build the Kraft Stadium.\u201d\nKraft\u2019s father, Robert, is the chief executive of the Kraft Group, which owns the New England Revolution, New England Patriots, and Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. Josh Kraft has said that if elected, he will recuse himself in talks concerning his family\u2019s plans for a new stadium for the Revolution in Everett.\nBecause much of the foot traffic for that stadium will come from Charlestown and a sliver of the project is in Boston, the City of Boston is involved in negotiations over that privately funded stadium.\nThe White Stadium rehabilitation plans, which aim to create a home for the women\u2019s professional soccer team Boston Legacy FC, has been met with mixed reaction locally. The stadium is located within Franklin Park, Boston\u2019s largest green space.\nThe Wu campaign spokesperson said Monday that backers of Boston Legacy FC \u201chave signed a lease to contribute more than $100 million in private investment into the public BPS facility of White Stadium \u2014which will remain controlled and used by BPS more than 345 days per year \u2014 while the Krafts have offered $750,000 to offset impacts from building their private soccer stadium.\"\nProponents have lauded the badly needed improvements to the facility, which had fallen into disrepair, and access for Boston Public Schools student-athletes and the Franklin Park community, as well as the positive impact of a women\u2019s professional soccer team playing in a public facility.\nAdvertisement\nBut there also has been plenty of pushback from opponents who say a professional soccer stadium is not the right fit for the location. They have concerns about the impact of the project on the park and the surrounding areas.\nIn recent weeks, the Emerald Necklace Conservancy continued its legal challenge of the project, filing a notice of appeal with Massachusetts Appeals Court.\nAt Monday\u2019s news conference, opponents of the project held signs reading \u201cSave Franklin Park\u201d and \u201cFranklin Stadium Bag Job.\u201d Much of the stadium\u2019s old edifice has been demolished. On Monday, scaffolding stood in front of one stadium stand that faced an entrance to the park.\nAdditionally on Monday, the NAACP Boston Branch called for an immediate halt to construction on the stadium. In a statement, that organization said it supports \u201cthe renovation of White Stadium into a high-quality public facility that serves all Boston Public School student-athletes and the communities surrounding Franklin Park.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, we have serious concerns about the current $200 million proposal to redevelop White Stadium into an 11,000-seat venue to be leased to Boston Unity Soccer Partners (BUSP), a private, for-profit entity,\u201d read the statement.\nBoston Legacy FC will play its entire home slate of games in its first NWSL season at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, as the stadium project will not be finished in time for the team\u2019s debut.\nThe team is to use the renovated stadium for portions of up to 40 days of the year, plus be responsible for year-round maintenance and operations.\nAn eight-lane track will surround the professional-level grass field, with BPS Athletics gaining new office space in the city-financed and rebuilt east grandstand, which also will contain student and community usage space.\nAdvertisement\nThe team is responsible for the construction of the west grandstand and a year-round restaurant being built just outside the stadium and still within the parcel.\nOn Monday, Kraft said he would support an alternative concept proposed by the Emerald Necklace Conservancy that would see White Stadium refurbished into a \u201chigh-quality, fully public high school stadium for $28.9 million.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I would\u2019ve liked to have seen happen,\u201d he said during the press conference.\nA handful of demonstrators protesting the city\u2019s current plan replied: \u201cStill can!\u201d\nThe city\u2019s proposal for the site, he said, constituted a \u201cbad idea\u201d from the onset. Wu, he said, has been \u201coutfoxed\u201d by private investors behind the deal.\n\u201cThe public deserve answers,\u201d he said.\nThe Wu campaign shot back on Monday that \u201cmore than 75 years after White Stadium was built, it needs a full renovation to serve BPS students and the people of Boston, and we will not allow billionaires to determine what gets built in our City.\u201d\n\u201cBoston is not for sale.\u201d\nMichael Silverman and Niki Griswold of Globe staff contributed to this report.\nDanny McDonald can be reached at daniel.mcdonald@globe.com.

      "text": "Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said Tuesday that Boston won\u2019t be able to share the total cost to the city for renovating Franklin Park\u2019s White Stadium until \u201clater this calendar year,\u201d after all construction bids for the project are finalized.\nWu did not provide a specific date for when residents should expect to know the full cost of the project, but hinted at the extended timeline in an interview that aired on WBUR\u2019s \u201cMorning Edition\u201d Tuesday. Earlier this month, Wu said that the city should have an updated cost estimate \u201cin a few weeks.\u201d\nWu on Tuesday indicated the later timeline for providing a final price tag is because not all the costs are known yet.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a great way to say, \u2018This is going to be the exact number,\u2019 because we\u2019re subject to public procurement laws and the bids that come in, and we\u2019re proceeding on this just as we do with every other construction project the city manages,\u201d Wu said in the WBUR segment. \u201cLater this calendar year, the bids should all be out the door.\u201d\nDemolition on the site is already complete, Wu said, and the city has already solicited bids for utilities for the project. In the fall, the city will put out bids for laying and pouring the foundation, and after that, put out bids for the construction on top of the foundation, she said to WBUR.\nAdvertisement\nWu has faced intense scrutiny and pushback over the project, particularly from a local nonprofit and group of residents that sued to stop the city from working with a new, professional women\u2019s soccer team to renovate the stadium for use by the team, as well as Boston Public Schools students.\nAdvertisement\nWu has characterized the partnership as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to offer the district\u2019s students access to a state-of-the-art facility, while sharing the cost with a private entity.\nResidents who oppose the project argue it effectively privatizes public parkland, and that Franklin Park and the surrounding neighborhoods are not an appropriate location for a professional sports stadium.\nWu\u2019s chief rival, Josh Kraft, has also attacked her over the rising price tag for the city\u2019s share of the project, which has already risen from an initial estimate of $50 million to $91 million.\nWu recently acknowledged the cost to the city will likely exceed the $91 million estimate the city previously shared, due to the rising cost of materials like steel. She has firmly denied Kraft\u2019s claim that the taxpayers will be on the hook for more than $170 million for the renovation, saying the city came up with the number as a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d budget contingency plan, but does not expect the cost to reach that figure.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always some level of cost escalation, unfortunately,\u201d Wu said on the radio Tuesday. \u201cIn major construction projects, we end up putting out bids, and whatever the price in the market is at that moment is what the city pays, for any construction project.\u201d\nThe Franklin Park Defenders, the group of residents who sued the city over the project, released a series of statements Tuesday criticizing Wu for the delay in sharing the total cost to taxpayers.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe city\u2019s timeline doesn\u2019t add up. City officials were scheduled to receive millions of dollars in construction bids for the White Stadium project by this month; they should be able to tell us exactly how much the project will cost,\u201d said Jessica Spruill, a Dorchester resident and member of the Franklin Park Defenders.\n\u201cCity officials need to make all the construction bids they\u2019ve received public, so that residents can know just how far over-budget the White Stadium project is,\u201d she continued in the statement.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the site of the project and critics\u2019 arguments against it. Opponents say the project would privatize public parkland. The Globe regrets the error.\nNiki Griswold can be reached at niki.griswold@globe.com. Follow her @nikigriswold."

      "text": "The Emerald Necklace Conservancy is going back to court to block the renovation of White Stadium, and the City of Boston and its new professional women\u2019s soccer team are not happy about it.\nThe nonprofit filed a notice of appeal Friday afternoon to the Massachusetts Appeals Court.\nThe intent of the renewed legal battle is to show that the Superior Court ruling issued by Judge Matthew Nestor last month did not address key issues introduced during the three-day trial by the plaintiffs, who unsuccessfully sought to stop the public-private project in Franklin Park that is expected to cost more than $200 million.\nA full text of the appeal is not yet available, but a press release issued by the ENC made three claims that it believes warrant relitigation: multiple violations of state law that prohibit commercial usage purposes; illegal sale of alcohol in a Boston Public Schools facility; and a violation of the George Robert White Trust.\nAn appeal on the grounds that the project is in violation of the Article 97 state law pertaining to change of use of parklands would mark the ENC\u2019s third try of that strategy. Before Nestor\u2019s ruling, another Superior Court judge ruled in March 2024 that the project was not a violation of Article 97 and thus could proceed.\nAdvertisement\nA city spokesperson expressed disappointment that a post-verdict meeting with the ENC did not result in a \u201cmore collaborative approach\u201d with the development of the stadium.\nThe city also hinted at a rethinking of its relationship with the group, which rents its Jamaica Plain headquarters from the city for $1 a year.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe city is disappointed and frustrated by this costly and meritless appeal, but we will not be deterred from delivering the decades-delayed White Stadium renovation that generations of BPS students and park users deserve, and which is now finally underway,\u201d read the statement in part. \u201cENC has had their day in court before two respected judges of the Massachusetts Superior Court and lost. Given the expense to Boston taxpayers of continuing to defend against ENC\u2019s already-rejected claims, the city will carefully consider the future of its relationship with ENC to better protect residents and our parks.\u201d\nA statement from Boston Legacy Football Club shared the city\u2019s disappointment, citing prior rulings and polls that show \u201ca resounding majority of residents support this historic investment for Boston Public Schools. We remain focused on advancing the work that is well underway as we prepare for the 2026 NWSL season.\u201d\nDemolition of the 76-year-old stadium is nearly complete and construction is expected to begin soon after the remaining rubble is cleared.\nOfficials from the city\u2019s Landmarks Commission visited the site Friday morning and received a briefing on, among other details, materials to be used for new exterior and interior facades, seat cover colors, and paving materials.\nThe city\u2019s share of the project is expected to rise above the current $91 million estimate, with the ownership group of the new NWSL team, Boston Legacy FC, picking up more than half of the remaining costs.\nThe city and team were not immediately available for comment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our mission to protect and support our public parks for future generations, even when it\u2019s hard,\u201d said Karen Mauney-Brodek, president of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, in the release. \u201cWe are optimistic that the courts will ultimately uphold the fundamental constitutional protections that all public recreation land in Massachusetts depends on, and protect Franklin Park and a public stadium for generations to come. And we\u2019re committed to partnering with the city, and anyone else, to make a fully public renovated White Stadium a reality.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe team is to use the renovated stadium for portions of up to 40 days of the year, plus be responsible for year-round maintenance and operations.\nA new eight-lane track will surround the professional-level grass field, with BPS Athletics gaining new office space in the city-financed and rebuilt east grandstand, which also will contain student and community usage space.\nThe team is responsible for the construction of the west grandstand and a year-round restaurant being built just outside the stadium and still within the parcel.\nOne bone of contention from the ENC is a new spur of paved road off Pierpont Road behind the west grandstand that leads to a loading dock to be used by the team. That change of use for commercial purpose was not addressed in the ruling, the ENC said. The group says that such a change would require two-thirds approval from the state Legislature to not violate the Article 97 law that prohibits a different use of public parklands.\nUsage of other roads running through Franklin Park and new utility trenches also violate Article 97, the ENC claims.\nThe ENC maintains that the ruling also ignored trial testimony about the sale of alcohol inside the stadium, which the plaintiffs said would be in violation of state law.\nAdvertisement\nBoston Legacy FC has said it hopes to begin playing its first season at White Stadium next March.\nThe east grandstand is not expected to be completed before late next year.\nLinda Henry, chief executive of Boston Globe Media Partners, announced in February that she was withdrawing from the investor group behind the soccer team.\nMichael Silverman can be reached at michael.silverman@globe.com."

The conservancy's plan aims to provide a public facility for Boston Public Schools without the extensive amenities of the city's proposal, which has faced criticism for its high costs and potential privatization of public parkland. Mayor Michelle Wu supports the larger project as a means to provide students with a state-of-the-art sports facility, while opponents argue it is unsuitable for the park's location.",
