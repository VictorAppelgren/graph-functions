  "title": "Why Do We Get Goiters? Causes Go Beyond Iodine Deficiency",
  "description": "For years, we blamed goiter on iodine deficiency, but the real story is far more complex, involving genetics, hormones, and the immune system.",
  "content": "You see the patient. They have a goiter\u2014an enlarged thyroid. But they live in an iodine-rich country. Eat a good diet. Their labs are normal. So why the swelling? For years, the answer we gave was simple. Too simple. Iodine [1] [2] [3]. Or a lack of it. The thyroid needs iodine to make its hormones. No iodine, the gland gets desperate. It grows bigger, hypertrophies, to try and soak up every last molecule from the blood. A neat story.\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t the whole truth. We started seeing holes in the theory. Goiters in places with plenty of iodine. People in deficient areas with no goiter at all. The story started to fall apart. Then the U-shaped curve data hit [8]. Too little iodine? Bad. But too much iodine? Also bad. This complicated things. Suddenly, our big public health fix\u2014iodized salt\u2014could actually be part of the problem for some. The thyroid wants what it wants. No more, no less.\n\nThe mess extends to the gland itself. Goiters aren\u2019t all the same. Some are diffuse, a smooth swelling. Others are nodular. Lumpy. For a long time, we figured nodules were just the end stage of that long, desperate growth from iodine deficiency [10]. But that never felt quite right either. By 2001, we were already pointing out that the iodine story just didn\u2019t explain the facts on the ground [5]. Something else was at play.\n\nThat \u201csomething else\u201d turned out to be a mix of things. Genetics, for one. We always suspected it; goiters run in families. But a 2011 genome-wide study gave us the proof [9]. It didn\u2019t just hint at a link. It found actual genetic addresses\u2014four of them\u2014tied directly to thyroid size and goiter risk. It\u2019s in the code. Some people are just built to have a bigger thyroid. Nothing to do with their diet.\n\nThen there\u2019s the hormonal engine. Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone, or TSH. It\u2019s the signal from the pituitary gland that tells the thyroid to work. When the gland is sluggish for any reason, the pituitary starts yelling. It cranks up TSH. And that constant hormonal shouting is a powerful growth signal [2] [3] [6]. It makes the thyroid swell. It\u2019s a key pathway. A final common denominator for a lot of goiters.\n\nAnd you can never, ever talk thyroid without talking about autoimmunity. This is the body attacking itself. In Hashimoto\u2019s, the immune system slowly chews up the gland, and the resulting inflammation and repair attempts make it swell. In Graves\u2019 disease, the immune system makes an antibody that acts like TSH on steroids, flooring the accelerator and making the whole gland grow [4]. These are huge causes of goiter. And they have nothing to do with iodine. It\u2019s a completely different mechanism of disease.\n\nSo, the simple model is gone. We\u2019re left with a more complex, messier, but more accurate picture. A goiter isn\u2019t a disease. It\u2019s a sign. A physical clue that points to a whole menu of possible problems.\n\nWe still check nutrition. Iodine is still critical. So are other things like selenium and iron [2] [3]. We don\u2019t worry so much about broccoli or cabbage\u2014the so-called goitrogens\u2014unless there\u2019s a real iodine deficiency to begin with. We\u2019re even questioning old villains like smoking; one big study found no real link in an iodine-rich population [7]. Now, we\u2019re even linking nodular goiters to things like metabolic syndrome, tying the thyroid into the body\u2019s overall systemic health [6].\n\nWhat does this change? It changes how we work. We have to be better detectives. A goiter diagnosis is just the start. Is TSH driving this? Is it autoimmune? Is there a family history? Are the nodules suspicious [4]? The management has to fit the cause. For a small, quiet goiter, the right answer is often just to watch it. If it\u2019s iodine, we supplement [1] [2]. Sometimes we use thyroid hormone to suppress that TSH shouting. And for the big ones, the ones causing symptoms or cosmetic issues, surgery is still the best tool in the box [4].\n\nThe neat and tidy story of goiter is history. It\u2019s messy now. It\u2019s genetics. It\u2019s immunity. It\u2019s hormones. The real shift isn\u2019t a new pill. It\u2019s a change in thinking. It\u2019s realizing the enlarged thyroid isn\u2019t the problem itself. It\u2019s a symptom of a deeper story we have to figure out, one patient at a time.\n\n[1] Hughes, K., & Eastman, C. (2012).

  "summary": "The article discusses the history of goiter, an enlarged thyroid, and the potential causes of goiters, which often occur in an iodine-rich country. The author suggests that while the simple explanation for goiter cases was initially simple, too little iodine, too much iodine could be part of the problem for some. However, the author points out that the theory of iodine deficiency was wrong, with some finding that the thyroid becomes desperate for its hormones and grows bigger. Genetics, the hormonal engine, or TSH, also plays a significant role in goitering, leading to a more complex picture of disease. The article suggests that a goiter isn't a disease but a sign of a physical clue that points to a wide range of potential problems. The authors also suggest that a genetic study found four genetic addresses directly linked to thyroid size and goiter risk. The study also found that some people are just built to have a bigger thyroid, not necessarily due to their diet, and that autoimmunity is another factor. The publication also notes that the author acknowledges that the diagnosis of goitters is often more complicated than a simple diagnosis and treatment.",
  "shortSummary": "Despite being iodine-rich, many people's goiters are causes by multiple causes, including thyroid swelling, genetic factors like obesity, TSH, and autoimmune disease.",

      "text": "Rethinking Multiple Sclerosis: Why Everything We Thought We Knew Is Changing\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- MS involves both inflammation and neurodegeneration from the outset, not just one after the other.\n- B-cells, a type of immune cell, are now understood to be critical drivers of the disease, a major shift from the previous T-cell-only focus.\n- In the U.S., Black individuals have the highest incidence of multiple sclerosis, highlighting profound health disparities linked to structural factors.\n- High-efficacy therapies that target B-cells have fundamentally changed treatment strategies and patient outcomes.\n- Diagnosis relies on the internationally recognized McDonald criteria, which use MRI to show evidence of damage spread across different areas of the nervous system and over time.\nThe story we used to tell about multiple sclerosis was simple. Clean. Maybe a little too clean. We taught it in lecture halls and explained it to patients. The script was always the same: MS is an autoimmune disease where the body\u2019s T-cells\u2014the special forces of the immune system\u2014go rogue. They mistake the nervous system for an invader and attack the myelin sheath, the fatty insulation that keeps our nerve signals moving fast. Strip away that insulation, you get short circuits. Relapses. Disability. It was a neat narrative. T-cells were the clear villain.\nBut the real world is messy. And the clues that our story was wrong came from our own treatments. New therapies came along that absolutely hammered B-cells\u2014another part of the immune army we\u2019d mostly ignored in the MS story. And they worked. Frighteningly well [4]. That begged a huge question. If this was a T-cell war, why was taking out the B-cell infantry so brutally effective?\nIt forced a complete reset. Turns out, B-cells aren\u2019t just standing around. They\u2019re key players, maybe even the ringleaders that get the T-cells riled up and keep the fires of chronic inflammation burning [1] [2]. This wasn\u2019t some minor academic correction. It changed everything. It meant our entire working model of the disease was incomplete. We\u2019d been staring at one piece of the puzzle, thinking it was the whole picture. The neat story was wrong.\nThis disease is a product of a murky conspiracy between a person\u2019s genes and some environmental trigger we still can\u2019t nail down [3] [10]. A virus from childhood? A chronic deficiency? We have a list of suspects, but no convictions. What we do know is that once it kicks off, it\u2019s a cascade of damage. And it\u2019s not just about the myelin anymore. It\u2019s about the nerve itself. The wire, not just the insulation.\nFirst job is getting the diagnosis right. For that, we have the MRI. It\u2019s our window into the damage [9]. We hunt for lesions\u2014the scars of past attacks\u2014in the brain and spinal cord. But one picture isn\u2019t enough. To be sure it\u2019s MS, we have to prove the damage is happening in different places and at different times. Dissemination in space and time. That\u2019s the mantra.\nThe McDonald criteria are the rules of the game for this, and they\u2019ve been sharpened over the years to be faster and more accurate [13]. The 2017 update, for example, cut down the waiting time for a diagnosis. Good. Because time is brain. The sooner we know, the sooner we can act. We even have advanced imaging now that lets us see past the obvious lesions to the subtle, fraying wires underneath it all [15].\nBut the sharper picture from our MRIs showed us something else. Something uncomfortable. The old textbooks taught us MS was a disease of white people with Northern European roots. That was the classic patient profile. Another part of our simple story. And another part that was dead wrong [8].\nThe data coming out now paints a very different picture. In the United States, Black individuals don\u2019t just get MS\u2014they have the highest incidence of the disease [14]. Hispanic communities are also hit hard. This isn\u2019t a footnote. It\u2019s the headline. It tells us that MS risk is shaped by more than just ancestry. It\u2019s shaped by society. It\u2019s about where you live, your access to care, and the systemic biases baked into the world [14]. It\u2019s a humbling reality check. A disease doesn\u2019t happen in a biological vacuum. It happens in the real world [7].\nThe last two decades? An absolute explosion in treatments [2] [5]. We went from having almost nothing to a whole arsenal of drugs. The new high-efficacy therapies, especially those B-cell killers, can slam the brakes on relapses and new MRI lesions [4]. They are powerful weapons against the inflammatory part of MS.\nBut stopping the inflammation, we\u2019re learning, is only half the job. MS isn\u2019t one thing. It\u2019s two. A two-headed monster. It is an inflammatory disease, yes. But it is also a neurodegenerative one [2] [6]. From day one, nerve fibers are being quietly damaged and permanently lost. Axonal transection. That\u2019s the technical term. It means the nerve fiber is cut. It doesn\u2019t grow back. This is the stealthy process that drives progressive disability, the slow worsening that can happen even when a person feels fine.\nFor years, we saw this as a two-act play: an early, inflammatory stage, followed by a later, degenerative stage. Another simple story. Also wrong. We now know they are partners in crime. Inflammation and neurodegeneration are happening at the same time, a vicious cycle running from day one [12].\nThis changes the mission entirely. The new mandate isn\u2019t just to cool down the immune system. It\u2019s to protect the brain itself. Neuroprotection. That\u2019s the holy grail now [11] [12]. We need drugs that not only stop the attacks but also shield the neurons from the fallout and, maybe, help the brain heal itself. We aren\u2019t there yet. But that\u2019s where everything is headed. The goalpost moves. It\u2019s not just \u201cno new attacks\u201d anymore. It\u2019s \u201csave the brain.\u201d Preserve function for the long haul. It means we have to finally toss out the simple stories and face the complicated, challenging reality of what this disease truly is.\nReferences\n[1] Yamout, B. I., & Alroughani, R. (2018).

      "text": "3D Bioprinting: How The Future of Medicine is Being Built, Layer by Layer\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- 3D bioprinting combines cells, growth factors, and biomaterials to fabricate biomedical parts.\n- The process requires special \u201cbio-inks,\u201d often made of materials like alginate or gelatin.\n- A key goal is to achieve over 80% cell viability after printing.\n- Current applications include skin grafts, bone regeneration, and building cancer models for research.\n- Major challenges include creating blood vessels (vascularization) and scaling up to full-sized organs.\nFor years it\u2019s been science fiction: printing a spare part for the human body on demand. But today in labs around the world that fiction is becoming a reality. 3D bioprinting, the marriage of biology and engineering, allows scientists to build living human tissue, layer by layer. From skin and cartilage to miniature livers, bioprinting will change how we treat disease, test drugs and repair trauma.\nBut it\u2019s much more than just loading a cartridge and pressing print. It\u2019s a delicate dance of biology, chemistry and mechanics where precision is required at every step to get living cells to form functional, life sustaining structures. Let\u2019s dive in and see how this technology works and where it\u2019s at.\nTable of Contents\n- The Dawn of a New Medical Era\n- The Blueprint for Life: What Does It Take to 3D Print Tissue?\n- From Lab Bench to Bedside: Where Is Bioprinting Used Today?\n- The Next Frontier: Overcoming Bioprinting\u2019s Biggest Hurdles\n- Building with Care: The Ethical and Regulatory Guardrails\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nThe Blueprint for Life: What Does It Take to 3D Print Tissue?\nCreating human tissue requires a precise process. Think of it not as printing a static object but as planting a high-tech garden. You need the right seeds, the right soil and the right environment for them to grow.\nBefore printing begins the pre bioprinting stage involves creating a model from medical imaging data and selecting the right materials and cell types.\n- Bio-inks: The \u201cSoil\u201d for Our Cells: The main ingredient is the bio-ink, a gel-like substance that carries the living cells. These aren\u2019t your typical inks; they are advanced biomaterials designed to support life. The base material for bioprinting often consists of hydrogels or other substrates that support cell growth. Cell laden hydrogels are a common form of bio-ink, embedding living cells within the printed structure. Common choices include natural polymers like alginate (from seaweed) or gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), which can be modified to mimic the natural environment of the human body, known as the extracellular matrix [1] [4]. The ideal bio-ink must be strong enough to hold a shape but gentle enough to keep cells alive [2].\n- Cell Sources: The \u201cSeeds\u201d of New Tissue: The living components, or \u201cseeds,\u201d can come from several sources. Autologous cells are taken from the patient, eliminating the risk of immune rejection. Cells can also be sourced from a donor or grown from stem cells, which have the amazing ability to develop into various cell types, whether for heart, bone or liver tissue [1] [3]. In some approaches mini tissue building blocks are used to assemble more complex tissues by mimicking the microenvironment and cellular organisation found in natural tissues.\n- Precision Printing: The bioprinter extrudes the bio-ink and cell mixture according to a digital 3D model. Extrusion based bioprinting is the most common method, where bioinks are deposited layer by layer through a nozzle. The bioprinter builds tissue by depositing multiple layers of material to form complex structures. The digital model guides the printer to achieve the desired shape of the tissue. Variables like temperature, pressure and printing speed are controlled to not damage the cells. The goal is to achieve high cell viability\u2014keep 80% or more of the cells alive and healthy throughout the process [1].\n- Maturation in a Bioreactor: A freshly printed structure isn\u2019t functional yet. It needs time to mature into a tissue. This happens in a bioreactor, a special device that simulates the conditions inside the human body. Post bioprinting steps, such as mechanical and chemical stimulation, help the tissue mature and become functional. It might bathe the tissue in a nutrient rich fluid, apply mechanical stresses to strengthen it (like the beating of a heart), or provide other cues that encourage cells to organize and function as a team [1] [4].\nFrom Lab Bench to Bedside: Where Is Bioprinting Used Today?\n3D printing and additive manufacturing are changing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine by allowing for precise fabrication of complex biological structures. While printing a full-sized transplantable organ is still in the future, 3D bioprinting is already making a big impact in several areas of medicine and research. According to the American Medical Association (AMA) review, it\u2019s moving fast.\nToday it\u2019s used in:\n- Regenerative Medicine: Tissues for repair, like skin grafts for burn victims, cartilage patches for joint injuries, and bone grafts [3]. Cartilage tissue engineering and bioprinted tissue for joint repair are advancing treatment options for musculoskeletal injuries. Bioprinting solutions are applicable to soft tissue repair to test new drugs.\n- Heart Repair: Engineering cardiac patches that can be implanted to heal tissue damaged by a heart attack. These patches are designed to support blood flow and often have vascular networks with endothelial cells to ensure tissue viability and integration.\n- Research Models: Bioprinting is a very useful tool for research. Scientists can print 3D cancer tumors to study their behavior and test new chemotherapy drugs much better than on 2D petri dish cultures. They can also build \u201corgan-on-a-chip\u201d systems\u2014small scale models of organs like liver or pancreas\u2014to understand disease and screen drugs for toxicity without using actual organs [5]. Bioprinted tissues and living tissues are increasingly used for drug testing, drug discovery and drug development, more accurate models that mimic human physiology.\n- Personalized Medicine: Bioprinting allows for patient specific tissues and organs, for personalized medicine. 3D bioprinting is being used in clinical practice, for surgical planning and medical education. Artificial organs and human organs for transplantation are becoming more possible with bioprinting technologies. Scaffold free and autonomous self assembly approaches are being explored to create tissues without synthetic scaffolds, inspired by embryonic organ development. Extrusion based bioprinting, inkjet printer-based methods and laser assisted bioprinting are used to print desired tissue structures, each with its own advantages.\nMaintaining optimal cell density is key to developing functional, vascularized tissues. Interdisciplinary fields like materials science and pharmaceutical sciences are driving bioprinting. Developing tissue with desired functions is the core of tissue engineering and living tissue, living tissues and human tissues are now achievable outcomes of advanced bioprinting technology. 3D printed tissues and organs and new methods are expanding the possibilities [6].\nA recent article in Asian Journal highlights the latest developments in bioprinting. It will change human health and improve patient outcomes and expand the boundaries of regenerative medicine.\nThe Next Frontier: Bioprinting\u2019s Biggest Challenges\nTo get to the full potential of bioprinting we need to overcome several big hurdles. The biggest is vascularization\u2014creating blood vessels. A small patch of tissue can get nutrients from its surroundings, but anything bigger than a few mm needs its own blood supply to deliver oxygen and remove waste. Without it the cells in the middle will die.\nOther big challenges are scalability\u2014how to print a whole kidney\u2014and material innovation. We are always looking for new bio-inks with better biological and mechanical properties [3] [4]. Advances in materials science are driving the development of new biocompatible bio-inks and substrates to fabricate functional tissues and organs.\nBioprinting solutions are being developed to tackle the challenge of building tissue with complex architectures, including vascularized and functional tissue constructs. New technologies are enabling the next generation of bioprinting to print more intricate and biomimetic structures for medical applications.\nThe future is also pointing to 4D bioprinting. This is using \u201csmart\u201d materials that change shape or function after printing in response to triggers like body heat or light. Imagine a printed graft that slowly unfolds and integrates itself once inside the body [3]. New methods and bioprinting technologies are being developed to overcome the current limitations, opening up new possibilities for regenerative medicine and pharmaceutical testing.\nBuilding with Care: The Ethical and Regulatory Guardrails\nPower comes with responsibility. The medical community knows that bioprinting has to be built with strong ethical and regulatory guardrails so it\u2019s used safely and fairly. Ongoing oversight is key to monitor the impact on human health and address emerging risks.\nKey considerations:\n- Informed Consent: Patients who donate cells for bioprinting must be fully informed on how their biological material will be used [1].\n- Equitable Access: As these therapies become available, we must ensure they don\u2019t only benefit the wealthy. A roadmap for fair access and affordability is needed [1] [3].\n- Regulatory Collaboration: Researchers are working with regulatory bodies like the FDA to establish standards for safety and efficacy before any bioprinted product can be used clinically. Integrating bioprinting into clinical practice requires rigorous testing to ensure patient safety and success.\n- Prohibited Uses: There\u2019s a general consensus that bioprinting for human reproductive purposes should be off limits without strict ethical oversight.\nClosing Thoughts\nBioprinting is one of the most exciting areas in medicine, moving from science fiction to reality to heal and repair the human body. While on-demand organs are years away, tissue engineering for repair and research is already saving and improving lives. By being careful and collaborative we are building the future of medicine, one layer at a time.\nThis article is for general information only and is not medical advice.

      "text": "Why Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Is More Than Just a Typing Disorder\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is the world\u2019s most common neuropathy caused by nerve compression.\n- It happens when the median nerve, which runs through your wrist, gets squeezed inside a narrow passage called the carpal tunnel.\n- Symptoms include numbness, tingling (\u201cpins and needles\u201d), and weakness, primarily in the thumb, index, and middle fingers.\n- Risk factors include repetitive hand motions, obesity, diabetes, and pregnancy.\n- Treatment options range from simple wrist splints and injections to highly effective outpatient surgery.\nThat buzzing, tingling, or numbness in your hand and fingers\u2014the kind that wakes you up at night or makes it hard to button a shirt\u2014is more than just a minor annoyance. It\u2019s your body\u2019s warning light. For millions of people, these sensations are the first signs of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), the most common nerve compression issue worldwide.\nIt\u2019s a condition that can significantly impact your work, hobbies, and overall quality of life. The good news? Over the last decade, our understanding of how to diagnose and treat CTS has advanced dramatically. Whether you\u2019re just starting to notice symptoms or have been struggling for years, there\u2019s a clear path to relief.\nThis guide will walk you through what\u2019s happening inside your wrist, bust some common myths, and explain the modern, effective treatments that can get you back to feeling your best.\nTable of Contents\n- What Is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Really?\n- The Myth of the \u201cTyping Disease\u201d\n- How Doctors Pinpoint the Problem\n- Your First Line of Defense: Conservative Treatments\n- When Is Surgery the Right Move?\n- A Personalized Path to Recovery\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nWhat Is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Really?\nImagine a narrow tunnel running through your wrist. This isn\u2019t a metaphor\u2014it\u2019s a real anatomical space called the carpal tunnel. Through this passage run the tendons that flex your fingers and, critically, the median nerve. This nerve is a superstar; it provides sensation to your thumb, index finger, middle finger, and half of your ring finger, and it controls the muscles at the base of your thumb [1].\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome occurs when the space inside this tunnel narrows or the tissues within it swell, putting pressure on the median nerve. Think of it like a garden hose getting kinked. When the flow of water (in this case, nerve signals) is restricted, problems arise. The result is pain, numbness, tingling, and eventually, weakness in your hand and fingers [9]. As detailed in information from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, ignoring these signals can lead to permanent nerve damage [5].\nThe Myth of the \u201cTyping Disease\u201d\nMany people believe CTS is caused exclusively by typing on a computer all day. While repetitive hand and wrist movements are certainly a major risk factor, they are only one piece of a much larger puzzle. The development of CTS is often multifactorial.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a combination of personal and occupational factors often contributes. Other significant risk factors include:\n- Anatomical Factors: Some people are simply born with smaller carpal tunnels.\n- Health Conditions: Diabetes, hypothyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis are all linked to a higher risk of CTS.\n- Obesity: A higher body mass index is a well-established risk factor [9].\n- Pregnancy: Fluid retention during pregnancy can increase pressure within the carpal tunnel, though it often resolves after delivery [4].\nBlaming your keyboard alone oversimplifies the issue and can prevent you from addressing other underlying factors that are just as important for management and prevention.\nHow Doctors Pinpoint the Problem\nGetting an accurate diagnosis is the first and most critical step toward relief. Your doctor will start by listening to your story\u2014when the symptoms started, what they feel like, and what makes them better or worse.\nNext comes a physical examination. Your doctor may use a few classic in-office tests to try and reproduce your symptoms:\n- Phalen\u2019s Maneuver: You\u2019ll be asked to flex your wrist, holding the backs of your hands together for a minute. If it causes tingling or numbness, it\u2019s a positive sign.\n- Tinel\u2019s Sign: Your doctor will gently tap over the median nerve at your wrist. A tingling sensation can indicate nerve irritation.\n- Flick Sign: A simple but telling sign is when a patient instinctively \u201cflicks\u201d their wrist to find relief, much like shaking a thermometer.\nWhile these tests are helpful, they aren\u2019t foolproof [7]. For a definitive diagnosis, your doctor will likely recommend electrodiagnostic studies. These tests, which include nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG), measure how well your median nerve is functioning. They are considered the gold standard for confirming CTS and determining its severity [8]. In some complex cases, an ultrasound or MRI might be used to get a better look at the structures in the wrist [6].\nYour First Line of Defense: Conservative Treatments\nFor most mild to moderate cases of CTS, the treatment journey begins with non-surgical, or \u201cconservative,\u201d approaches. The goal is simple: reduce pressure on the median nerve and allow it to heal.\nA 2021 study confirms that a few key strategies are highly effective first-line treatments [2].\n- Wrist Splinting: Wearing a brace, especially at night, is one of the most impactful things you can do. It keeps your wrist in a neutral position, preventing the flexion and extension that can compress the nerve while you sleep [5].\n- Corticosteroid Injections: Injecting a powerful anti-inflammatory medication directly into the carpal tunnel can provide significant, albeit sometimes temporary, relief by reducing swelling around the nerve. A 2011 systematic review found this to be a beneficial short-term strategy [10].\n- Activity and Ergonomic Modification: Small changes can make a big difference. This could mean adjusting your workstation, taking more frequent breaks, or using tools with more ergonomic grips to reduce strain.\nWhen Is Surgery the Right Move?\nIf your symptoms are severe, if you have muscle weakness, or if conservative treatments haven\u2019t provided enough relief, it may be time to consider surgery. The procedure, called a carpal tunnel release (CTR), involves cutting the ligament that forms the \u201croof\u201d of the carpal tunnel. This creates more space for the median nerve, instantly relieving the pressure.\nCTR is one of the most common and successful procedures in medicine. There are two main ways to perform it:\n- Open Release: The surgeon makes a small incision in the palm of your hand to directly view and cut the ligament.\n- Endoscopic Release: The surgeon uses one or two smaller incisions and a tiny camera (endoscope) to see inside and cut the ligament.\nBoth techniques are highly effective [2]. However, studies suggest that the endoscopic approach often leads to a faster recovery and less immediate postoperative pain, allowing patients to return to their activities sooner [3]. The idea that surgery is a painful, last-ditch effort with a long recovery is largely outdated. For the right patient, it offers a definitive, long-term solution.\nA Personalized Path to Recovery\nUltimately, there\u2019s no single \u201cbest\u201d treatment for everyone. The right approach for you will depend on the severity of your symptoms, your overall health, your daily activities, and the results of your diagnostic tests.\nThe most advanced clinical thinking advocates for an individualized plan that combines all this information [8]. Working with your doctor, you can weigh the pros and cons of each option. Some patients find lasting relief with a simple night splint, while for others, surgery is the most direct path to restoring full hand function and ending the sleep-disrupting pain for good.\nClosing Thoughts\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome can feel like a frustrating and persistent intrusion on your life, but you don\u2019t have to just live with it. With a better understanding of the condition and a wealth of effective, evidence-based treatments available, relief is within reach. The key is to listen to your body\u2019s signals and seek medical guidance early. A proactive approach, guided by a healthcare professional, is your best bet for preventing long-term issues and ensuring a full recovery.

      "text": "The Reality of Robotic Surgery for Endometrial Cancer\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Robotic surgery is a high-tech tool, not an autonomous surgeon; a human is always in control.\n- Key benefits include smaller cuts, less bleeding, and a quicker recovery compared to open surgery.\n- The technique is particularly useful for patients with a high BMI, a group at higher risk for complications with traditional surgery.\n- The surgeon\u2019s experience with the robotic system is the single most important factor for success.\n- Drawbacks include high costs and the fact that not all hospitals have this technology available.\nTable of Contents\n- Cutting Through the Hype of the \u2018Robot\u2019 Surgeon\n- The Real-World Problem Robotic Surgery Solves\n- The Skill of the Surgeon, Not Just the Machine\n- Making the Right Choice for You\nCutting Through the Hype of the \u2018Robot\u2019 Surgeon\nThe term \u201crobotic surgery\u201d gets thrown around a lot. It conjures up images of futuristic, flawless machines operating with cold precision. The marketing is slick. But inside the hospital, the conversation is a lot more grounded, wrestling with a fundamental question: Is this incredibly expensive technology truly a leap forward for every patient, or is it a sophisticated tool that\u2019s only a game-changer for some?\nThe first thing to get straight is what it isn\u2019t. The robot doesn\u2019t perform the surgery. Not even close. The surgeon is in complete control, sitting at a console, looking at a magnified, 3D view of the patient\u2019s anatomy. The \u201crobot\u201d is a set of arms that translate the surgeon\u2019s hand movements into incredibly fine, steady motions inside the body.\nThink of it as the ultimate tool, not the ultimate craftsman. It allows for movements that are more precise and have a wider range of motion than a human wrist can manage on its own [1]. But the brain, the judgment, the expertise? That\u2019s all human.\nThe Real-World Problem Robotic Surgery Solves\nSo, why bother? What\u2019s the problem it\u2019s trying to solve? For many cases of early-stage endometrial cancer, the standard treatment is a hysterectomy and removing the uterus. For decades, this meant a large abdominal incision, or laparotomy. That approach works, but it comes with significant pain, a longer hospital stay, and a higher risk of complications like infections. Then came laparoscopy, using small incisions and a camera. A big improvement.\nBut both of those methods can be technically challenging in certain patients. Here\u2019s the clinical reality: surgery on patients with a high body mass index (BMI) is harder. It just is. A thick abdominal wall can make getting a good view difficult and increase the risk of wound complications significantly. This is where robotic-assisted surgery really shines.\nThe stability of the robotic platform and the superior visualization help to overcome some of these challenges [2]. For this specific group, the benefits aren\u2019t just marginal. We\u2019re talking about significantly less blood loss, fewer complications, and a much faster return to normal life [3] [4]. That\u2019s not hype. That\u2019s a meaningful clinical advantage.\nThe Skill of the Surgeon, Not Just the Machine\nHere\u2019s the big catch, though, and it\u2019s the point that often gets lost. The machine is only as good as the person operating it. A surgeon\u2019s experience and skill are, without question, the most critical factors in the success of any surgery\u2014robotic or otherwise [6].\nAn expert surgeon who has performed hundreds of laparoscopic hysterectomies may deliver a better outcome than a less experienced surgeon using a brand-new robot. The learning curve for robotic surgery is real. It takes time and repetition to become truly proficient [5].\nThis is the conversation that matters. Not just \u201cdo you have a robot?\u201d but \u201chow many of these procedures has my surgeon done with it?\u201d Then there are the practical issues. These machines are expensive to buy and maintain, a cost that gets passed through the system [6]. And not every hospital has one, which creates a very real issue of access to care.\nMaking the Right Choice for You\nSo what\u2019s the bottom line? Don\u2019t get mesmerized by the technology itself. Robotic surgery is a powerful, important tool in the arsenal for treating\nendometrial cancer, especially for patients who might otherwise face a high-risk open surgery [1] [2]. But it is not a magic wand. The \u201cbest\u201d surgery is the one that is safest for your specific situation, performed by a skilled surgeon in whom you have confidence. The conversation to have with your care team isn\u2019t about getting \u201cthe robot.\u201d It\u2019s about understanding all the options on the table and finding the right tool, in the right hands, for your specific journey.\nReferences\n[1] Abu-Rustum, N., Yashar, C., Arend, R., Barber, E., Bradley, K., Brooks, R., Campos, S.

It goes beyond the idea that everyone with the same medical condition needs the same medical treatment. Instead it uses advanced genetic tests to figure out what treatment might work best for a specific person\u2019s biology. But there\u2019s a big problem: it can be very expensive and complicated. That\u2019s where health insurance comes in, because insurance coverage can decide if people can afford these advanced tests and treatments.\nTable of Contents\n- What is Precision Medicine?\n- Health Insurance and Personalized Medicine\n- Genetic Testing in Precision Medicine\n- FDA\u2019s Role in Precision Medicine\n- Factors Affecting Coverage Decisions for Genetic Testing\n- Proposed Solutions and Future Directions for Targeted Therapies\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nWhat is Precision Medicine?\nPrecision medicine is the new way of healthcare that doesn\u2019t just use the old \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d formula. Instead it looks at the unique genes, lifestyle habits and even environment of each individual. This idea got major attention through the Precision Medicine Initiative which is all about finding personalized ways to prevent and treat diseases.\nAlthough it may sound brand new, some aspects have been around for a while. Matching blood types for transfusions was an early form of personalized care. Patients with the same clinical diagnosis may respond differently to treatments, that\u2019s why personalized therapy based on molecular information and biomarkers is important. Researchers now want to expand precision medicine to many different conditions. By looking at each patient\u2019s genes and daily life, doctors can uncover deeper insights into treatments and disease prevention.\nHealth Insurance and Personalized Medicine\nInsurance coverage is key here because advanced genetic tests can be costly. Precision medicine goes even deeper than standard treatments by looking at a person\u2019s genetic signals to come up with a better targeted plan. This approach tailors medical strategies for the treatment and prevention of a particular disease, considering individual differences such as genes and lifestyle. Many people can see better results, fewer side effects and less guesswork. But some insurers are not convinced these treatments always justify their price tags. This uncertainty leads to variations in what insurance plans will cover and it can keep people from getting these life changing treatments [5]. This is especially true for cancer treatment.\nGenetic Testing in Precision Medicine\nGenetic testing is the backbone of precision medicine. By looking at a patient\u2019s genetic makeup, doctors can see the possibility of certain diseases and how the body might respond to different drugs. That allows doctors to get more precise with treatments and can help reduce unnecessary costs from treatments that won\u2019t work.For example, if a genetic test shows a higher risk of certain diseases, the patient can start preventive care early to stop problems from getting worse. Another scenario: If a test finds specific genetic variants that interact poorly with certain medicines, the care team can choose a safer, more effective alternative right away.\nFDA\u2019s Role in Precision Medicine\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is big in making sure genetic tests and targeted therapies actually help people and not harm them. Since technology moves fast, the FDA uses a flexible approach and supports new tests as they come out. One of its key efforts is the precisionFDA platform which brings together researchers, medical professionals and tech developers. The idea is to share data, validate new tests and create a more solid foundation for precision medicine to grow. This will deliver better care to patients faster with strong safety checks.\nCurrent State and Challenges of Genetic Predispositions\nDespite all the progress, there are real challenges.\n- Coverage Gaps: Different insurance plans have their own rules on coverage for genetic testing. This can create big differences in what patients can access even if they have the same diagnosis [5].\n- Decision-Making Complexity: Insurers look at a combination of clinical studies, doctor opinions and cost analysis but there isn\u2019t always enough data to prove the value of new genetic tests [3], [10]. That lack of evidence makes coverage decisions complicated especially when genetic differences can affect how beneficial a test or therapy is for each individual.\n- Variations in Coverage: One insurance plan might label a targeted treatment as necessary while another plan calls it experimental or too new [2], [11]. That\u2019s frustrating for patients who just want the best care but have to deal with inconsistent coverage rules.\nFactors Affecting Coverage Decisions for Genetic Testing\nWhen deciding to cover certain tests or therapies, insurers look at:\n- Quality of Life Improvements: Treatments that significantly reduce symptoms or side effects will get favorable coverage.\n- Medical Expert Consensus: If well-respected groups of doctors and scientists agree a test or therapy works, that\u2019s a strong sign for insurers.\n- Life Expectancy Gains: In cancer care for example, if a particular targeted therapy helps people live longer, insurers will be more likely to approve it [6].\nProposed Solutions and Future Directions for Targeted Therapies\nPrecision Reimbursement Models\nOne idea is to move away from \u201cone plan fits all\u201d coverage. By tailoring insurance payments and decisions to the individual, insurers can account for how each person\u2019s body will respond to a therapy [1]. This will reduce waste on treatments that won\u2019t help. Additionally, collecting real-world data from everyday medical care will give a clearer picture of how well a therapy works and which patients benefit most [4].\nCollaboration and Transparency\nBetter collaboration among insurance companies, doctors, researchers and regulators will lead to faster adoption of tested and effective therapies [3]. On top of that, being open about which genetic variations are most \u201cactionable\u201d for treatment decisions reduces confusion for everyone involved [2]. This will make it easier for insurers to know what they\u2019re paying for and why it matters.\nHealth Economics and Policy\nLooking at the dollars and cents behind a new therapy will help insurance companies figure out how to pay for them [9]. At the same time, health policies may need to change so insurers cover tests that prove beneficial and address social challenges that prevent people from getting care. This matters in breast cancer research for example where certain communities may not have the same access to new tests or therapies [7], [8].\nNational and Global Perspectives\nSome healthcare systems around the world already cover more precision medicine tests [10]. Rigorous health technology assessments will provide guidance on the most beneficial and cost-effective approaches [11]. Over time, more research and strategic funding will refine coverage standards so more people have access to these life-saving therapies [12].\nClosing Thoughts\nHealth insurance is the deciding factor on who gets to benefit from precision medicine. Although there are many challenges\u2014coverage gaps, limited data and varied approaches to what\u2019s \u201cexperimental\u201d\u2014there are solutions on the horizon. Adjusting reimbursement models to focus on individuals, collecting real-world results, encouraging collaboration among different groups and clarifying what genetic variations mean will shape the landscape of health coverage for advanced treatments.So let\u2019s keep pushing for fairness and value. Let\u2019s work together and improve policies to guide insurers towards consistent evidence-based coverage. With insurer support, precision medicine can become part of everyday practice and patients can get highly personalized care that improves their outcomes.\nReferences\n[1] Budhdeo, S., Ruhl, M., Agapow, P.

The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of goiter and thyroid nodules in 3 regions with different iodine intake levels: mildly deficient, more than adequate, and excessive. Design, patients and measurements: Of the 3385 un-selected subjects enrolled in 1999 in Panshan, Zhangwu, and Huanghua where median urinary iodine excretion (UIE) was 83.5 \u03bcg/l, 242.9 \u03bcg/l, and 650.9 \u03bcg/l, respectively, 2708 (80.0%) participated in the follow-up study in 2004. The examinations of thyroid ultrasonography, thyroid function, thyroid autoantibodies and UIE were performed at baseline and follow-up. Results: The cumulative incidence of diffuse goiter was 7.1 %, 4.4%, and 6.9%, respectively, higher in Panshan and Huanghua than in Zhangwu (p=0.013 and p=0.015) and that of nodular goiter was 5.0%, 2.4%, and 0.8%, respectively, declining with increasing iodine intake levels (p<0.001). Mild iodine deficiency, chronic iodine excess as well as positive thyroid autoantibodies were associated with the occurrence of goiter [Logistic regression: odds ratio (OR)=1.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26\u20132.65), OR=1.46 (95% CI 1.01\u20132.11 ) and OR=1.68 (95% CI 1.14\u20132.48), respectively]. The cumulative incidence of single nodule was 4.0%, 5.7%, and 5.6%, respectively and that of multiple nodules was 0.4%, 1.2%, and 1.0%, respectively. Conclusions: The relationship between iodine and the risk for the occurrence of diffuse goiter shows a U-shaped curve. Nodular goiters are more prevalent in iodine-deficient areas.\nArticle PDF\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\nReferences\nKnobel M, Medeiros-Neto G.

      "text": "Abstract\nGoiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland, is a common problem in clinical practice associated with iodine deficiency, increase in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, natural goitrogens, smoking, and lack of selenium and iron. Evidence suggests that heredity also has an important role in the etiology of goiter. The current classification divides goiter into diffuse and nodular, which may be further subdivided into toxic (associated with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, suppressed TSH or both), or nontoxic (associated with a normal TSH level). Nodular thyroid disease with the presence of single or multiple nodules requires evaluation due to the risk of malignancy, toxicity, and local compressive symptoms. Measurement of TSH, accurate imaging with high-resolution ultrasonography or computed tomography, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy are the appropriate methods for evaluation and management of goiter. This review discusses the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment considerations of nontoxic diffuse and nodular goiters.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\nIntroduction\nGoiter, a common problem in clinical practice, is characterized by a diffuse or localized enlargement of the thyroid at any stage of life. It is associated with changes in the thyroid\u2019s ability to secrete adequate amounts of hormones as a result of intrinsic glandular defects or exogenous factors that modify the normal activity of the gland. Depending on the elements involved in this process and the efficacy of the adaptive mechanisms, the enlargement of the gland often prevents the development of hypothyroidism. Regardless of clinical presentation, the development of a goiter is essentially the same: an attempt of the thyroid to adapt to circumstances of impaired hormone secretion.\nAccording to morphological characteristics, a goiter may be classified as diffuse or nodular. The term \u201cnodular thyroid disease,\u201d which encompasses single and multiple palpable or nonpalpable nodules, is more descriptive and accurate than the currently used terms \u201csolitary thyroid nodule\u201d and \u201cmultinodular goiter.\u201d In an epidemiological context, the terms sporadic or endemic are used. Endemic goiter refers to a circumstance in which goiter is present in more than 10 % of the population due to chronic iodine deficiency. A nodular goiter may be either toxic or nontoxic. In contrast to solitary nodular disease, which displays more uniform clinical, pathological, and molecular pictures, multinodular goiter belongs to a group of mixed nodular entities. The same gland often presents a combination of thyroid lesions producing excessive, deficient, and normal amounts of hormones. The balance of the functional properties of individual nodules present in a nodular goiter determines the functional status of the thyroid, which may be of normal function, or subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism. In the absence of thyroid dysfunction, inflammation, or malignancy, nodular goiter along with diffuse goiter is a clinical entity identified as simple or nontoxic goiter.\nNontoxic diffuse goiter (NDG)\nAn NDG is an enlargement of the thyroid that occurs regardless of circulating TSH levels and affects individuals living in areas of iodine sufficiency (sporadic NDG) or, more frequently, of mild to moderate iodine deficiency (endemic NDG). In addition to the higher level of iodine intake, sporadic NDG, when compared with endemic NDG, develops in younger individuals who are usually transitioning from puberty into adulthood, grows slowly but continuously, and is associated with normal thyroid function tests (serum thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] and free thyroxine [free T4) [1].\nA persistent increase in TSH stimulation due to chronic iodine deficiency in NDGs leads initially to a homogeneous increase in thyroid size, but maintenance of the normal morphology of the follicles. The structural heterogeneity that develops later in NDGs may be due to a greater sensitivity of different follicles to TSH stimulation, even when TSH is within normal levels [1].\nStrong arguments support the hypothesis that both sporadic and endemic NDGs result from an interaction of the events mentioned above. Iodine deficiency is a well- recognized dominant (and probably permissive) factor in this setting, particularly in endemic goiters. Other factors, such as dietary (Table 1) and environmental chemicals (Table 2), as well as heterogeneous genetic abnormalities of the thyroid may contribute to the development of NDG, although the influence of these factors seems to only be substantial in conditions of low iodine intake [2].\nNontoxic nodular goiter (NNG)\nAn NNG is characterized by a nodular increase of the thyroid resulting from multifocal monoclonal or polyclonal proliferation of thyrocytes producing groups of new follicles or structures similar to follicles considerably heterogeneous from functional and morphological points of view.\nThe prevalence of NNG in a population correlates inversely with the iodine intake [3]. Based on ultrasonographic studies in iodine-deficient areas, the reported frequency of nodular disease in adults is about 30\u201340 % in women and 20\u201330 % in men. Small differences in the environmental supply of iodine may explain the diverse rates of thyroid abnormalities found in various populations. Differences reported in association with iodine intake include goiter frequency (15 % with a mild and 23 % with a moderate deficiency), and nodular size (increased in individuals with moderate iodine deficiency) [4].\nThe frequency of nodules seems to increase with age. In an area of borderline iodine deficiency in Denmark, NNG was found in 23 % of 2656 individuals aged 41\u201371 years and increased with age [5].\nOn the other hand, the association between age and thyroid volume is conflicting. In areas of iodine deficiency (except for those with severe deficiency) and sufficiency, the volume of the thyroid is reported to peak and plateau around the age of 40 years. In contrast, in the iodine-sufficient Whickham cohort, the frequency of goiter decreased with age along 20 years of follow-up both in women (from 23 to 10 %) and men (from 5 to 2 %) [6].\nEtiology of NDG and NNG\nNodular thyroid disease is a heterogeneous disorder divided into solitary nodular and multinodular. Histologically, benign thyroid nodules may be divided into true adenomas (encapsulated lesions) or adenomatous nodules (nonencapsulated lesions). These nodules may also be divided according to morphological criteria following the World Health Organization (WHO) classification [7]. In contrast to solitary nodular disease which has a more uniform clinical, pathologic, and molecular picture, NNG is a mixed nodular entity.\nThe same primary and secondary factors implicated in the etiology of NDGs mentioned above also exert potential influence on the development of NNGs [1] (Fig. 1). However, in NNGs, these factors culminate after decades with development of areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, marked fibrosis, and calcification [8]. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that nodular areas within the same gland exhibit different uptakes of iodine and generation of cyclic AMP, confirming the functional heterogeneity of NNGs, as discussed below [9].\nUntil recently, NNG was mainly regarded as a consequence of iodine insufficiency and persistent (although often only marginal) TSH elevation leading to thyrocyte proliferation and diffuse enlargement of the gland during childhood and adolescence [10]. According to this hypothesis, nodules would subsequently appear with age, leading to the development of a multinodular goiter. While the important roles of iodine deficiency and the growth-promoting contribution of TSH are still recognized, this hypothesis has been revised. An NNG is now considered a consequence of an inherent propensity of the thyroid to develop nodules with age, amplified by the presence of additional factors further promoting thyrocyte proliferation and nodule formation [1].\nAn analysis based on the Mendelian principles has confirmed the complexity involved in the hereditary transmission in NNG. It became clear more recently, as discussed below, that both sporadic and endemic NNG belong to a group of complex diseases. Their clinical presentation is influenced by genetic and environmental factors and both vary in severity.\nA substantial number of NNGs occur outside areas with scarce iodine supply and in patients who have never been exposed to iodine deficiency. The fundamental process of goitrogenesis is independent of iodine deficiency and operates through mechanisms innate to the hereditary and acquired heterogeneity within the thyrocytes themselves. However, superimposed iodine shortage, even at moderate degrees, greatly enhances the incidence of NNG and shifts its clinical appearance toward younger individuals (schoolchildren and young adults) with the additional influence of enhanced TSH secretion (Fig. 1). This fact has been confirmed in a population study in Denmark, where the iodine consumption per capita has been recently described as low [8].\nIt should be mentioned that the constitutional factor represented by the female gender is involved in the etiology of goiter on a population level, since the ratio of affected women to men in nonendemic regions is higher than 5\u20131 (some studies estimate a proportion of 10\u20131), although the reasons for this are poorly understood. Thus, at present, one can only speculate the occurrence of a genetic susceptibility to thyroid disease or a direct impact of steroid hormones. In fact, a growth-promoting effect of estrogen has been described in vitro in rat FRTL-5 cells and thyroid cancer cell lines and has been proposed as a possible contributing and constitutional effect of gender [11]. In addition, it has been suggested that 17\u03b2-estradiol amplifies the growth factor-induced signaling in the normal thyroid and in thyroid tumors [12].\nSmoking is another unquestionable environmental factor that contributes to the development of NNGs, especially in areas of mild iodine deficiency. It has been confirmed that the thiocyanate present in tobacco competes with SLC5A5 (solute carrier family 5 [sodium-iodide symporter], member 5, or NIS [sodium-iodide symporter]) for the active uptake of iodine in the basal membrane of the thyrocyte [13, 14].\nOther factors associated with an increased risk of development of thyroid nodules and goiter include pregnancy (which is associated with an increased prevalence of thyroid nodules and goiter in iodine-deficient, but not iodine-replete areas) [14], and presence of uterine fibroids (which is associated with a two-fold increased risk of thyroid nodules, probably related to estrogen and other physiopathological mechanism) [15]. The pathogenesis of the association between goiter and oral contraceptives remains to be settled and is probably a combination of several direct and indirect effects of sex steroids on the thyroid [16]. Statins seem to be associated with goiter by an antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of the drug on thyroid cells [17], whereas the association of alcohol consumption and a lower prevalence of goiter and thyroid nodules is currently unclear [14].\nDietary goitrogenic agents that interfere with iodine uptake by the thyroid (such as cassava thiocyanate) may be considered important in the prevalence of goiter, since these agents block the incorporation of iodide into the follicular cell, similarly to pharmacological agents such as propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole. These agents frequently exert a potentiating action in conditions of relatively low dietary iodine [8]. This fact has been clearly observed in some areas in Brazil (in the south of Maranh\u00e3o and Piau\u00ed states and part of the Tocantins state) which have a high prevalence of goiter. The local population consumes large amounts of products derived from babassu coconut (edible oil, pressed coconut, and babassu \u201cflour\u201d), which is present in the inner layer of the seed [18]. It has been documented that the skin of the coconut and the \u201cflour\u201d have a PTU-like action that blocks the enzyme peroxidase with very low efficiency (Table 1). Paradoxically, excessive dietary iodine can also lead to the development of NDG [19]. This has been documented in a study performed in the northern part of the Japanese archipelago (Sapporo, Hokkaido) in which the population maintains high blood iodine concentration due to chronic ingestion of foods rich in iodine such as sea algae. The most accepted hypothesis is that the incorporation of iodine into tyrosine residues of the thyroglobulin (TG) molecule is blocked hindering the synthesis of triiodothyronine (T3) and T4. With this inhibition (known as the Wolff\u2013Chaikoff effect) there is a decrease in circulating thyroid hormones and consequent increase in TSH, which leads to an increase in thyroid volume. In that study, removal of sea algae from the diet overtly reduced goiter in the participating individuals. Certain medications acting on the thyroid eventually result in thyromegaly. For instance, chronic and continuous therapy with lithium in certain psychiatric disorders may inhibit thyroid hormone release, resulting in lower circulating hormone availability. Goiter is a common side effect of lithium. Among individuals with bipolar disorder treated with lithium, up to 40 % develop goiter and about 20 % become hypothyroid [20].\nIn addition to medications, environmental chemicals can impact thyroid function and incidentally contribute to the development of goiter. Known endocrine disruptors include exogenous agents that interfere with the production, release, transport, metabolism, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones, particularly thyroid hormones, responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis, regulation of growth, and behavior. Considering only their effects in humans, these substances are foreign to the body, causing deleterious effects to individuals or their descendants as a result of interferences on the endocrine system [21].\nThyroid disruptors can affect the physiology of the gland at several stages, interfering with the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, inhibiting the active transport of inorganic iodine to the thyrocyte, mimicking or antagonizing the action of thyroid hormones, inducing the expression or inhibiting regulatory enzymes associated with the synthesis and metabolism of thyroid hormones, and modifying the levels of thyroid hormone receptors or signal transduction resulting from hormonal action [21]. These features are depicted in (Table 2).\nEven though the genetic involvement is complex in nature and has many areas which are not yet fully understood, it must be regarded as decisive in the development of NDG and NNG, mainly in circumstances of moderate iodine dietary deficiency [22\u201327]. Therefore, we must accept that the presence of one or more of the environmental factors listed in Table 1 along with individual genetic determinants will ultimately be responsible for triggering processes that lead to goiter development. The occurrence of NDG during adolescence and associated with a clear familial occurrence, even in conditions of normal dietary iodine intake, is highly indicative of a genetic susceptibility. In contrast with familial NDG caused by random genetic variations due to spontaneous mutations, some families have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance [25, 26]. Gene\u2013gene interactions and polygenic mechanisms (i.e., synergistic effects of genetic variations or polymorphisms) indicate the complexity of the pathogenesis of NDG or NNG. In addition, genetic predisposition to the disease has been evidenced in studies with thorough familial genetic screening, as well as studies carried out with twins [23, 24].\nChildren born to parents with sporadic NDG have a significantly higher risk of developing goiter in adulthood when compared with offspring of unaffected parents [23]. The elevated incidence of NDG in women and its high concordance in monozygotic, when compared with dizygotic twins, reinforce the influence of a genetic predisposition [23]. Another consonant aspect is the recurrence of goiter after partial thyroidectomy, which can occur months or years after surgery. Recurrence seems to be linked to autosomal recessive genetic defects in the thyroid system, suggesting the occurrence of putative dyshormonogenesis in familial euthyroid goiter [22]. Genetic defects similar to those found in hypothyroid patients but with minor functional consequences are likely to be compensated with the development of a euthyroid goiter, especially in association with iodine deficiency [22].\nMost of these defects could affect candidate genes involved in the physiology of the thyroid: TG, TPO, NIS (SLC5A5), SLC26A4 [solute carrier family 26 (anion exchanger), member 4)], PDS (pendrin), DUOX2 (thyroid oxidase 2 or dual oxidase 2). The defects can lead to lower clinical expression of these genes with development of goiters of small or medium sizes when the iodine nutritional environment is favorable, that is, in conditions of low dietary iodine [22]. This fact is observed even in individuals with a compound heterozygous or homozygous defect in certain genes, such as the IYD (iodotyrosine deiodinase) or DEHAL1. In contrast, the genetic defect in the heterozygous condition (one mutant allele) can lead to mild phenotypic manifestations, leading to a more severe clinical picture in the presence of iodine deficiency [22].\nLinkage studies have been carried out to analyze the coinheritance of different genomic regions, as well as to assess the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. The genome-wide linkage analysis identified the candidate locus MNG1 (multinodular goiter 1) on chromosome 14q31 in a large Canadian family with 18 affected members [25]. This locus was confirmed in another German family with simple goiter that recurred after successive surgeries [26]. Both families showed the dominant pattern of inheritance with high penetrance. It is also worth mentioning a study carried out in an Italian family which detected a link between NNG and the X chromosome (autosomal dominant) and a novel NNG gene mapping to the MNG2 (Xp22) locus which awaits confirmation [27].\nTo identify other causal genes, a genome-wide linkage study has been performed in 18 families with goiter in Denmark, Germany, and Slovenia. In 20 % of the families investigated, four novel candidate loci were identified in different chromosomes (2p, 3p, 7q, and 8p) [28]. An individual contribution of the 3p locus was attributed to four families, whereas the other loci were attributed to one family each. This suggests a dominant pattern of inheritance in NNG [28]. In summary, we can state that the multiple risk factors mentioned above are likely to interact with or activate genetic susceptibility leading to the disorder. In contrast to sporadic NNG, which is caused by spontaneous recessive genomic variations, most cases of familial NNG present an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, indicating predominant genetic defects.\nPhysiopathology of NNG\nThe pathogenesis of goiter has been detailed elsewhere [1, 22]. An adapted summary of its main aspects is presented below.\nThyroid gland hyperplasia\nNodular goiters result from hyperplasia of follicular cells in one or several areas of the thyroid. The basic goitrogenic process is the development of new follicular cells forming new follicles or increasing the size of newly formed follicles. The driving force on the development of an NNG is an abnormal potential for intrinsic growth in a small number of thyrocytes. Genetic, endogenous, and environmental factors can act on this basic process and accelerate growth. TSH is the most important stimulator of growth and thyroid function under physiological conditions in vivo.\nHigher serum clearance of iodide\nIn chronic iodine deficiency, the thyroid maintains a constant concentration of iodine by increasing the clearance of plasma inorganic iodine. This phenomenon has been described by several authors [8]. The relationship is such that the product of thyroid clearance and iodine concentration is constant within the observed range of serum iodine concentrations. This product represents absolute iodine uptake, which is the mass of iodine available to the gland per unit of time. Despite the elevated clearance, absolute iodine uptake tends to be lower in iodine-deficient areas, indicating that the compensatory mechanism is neither perfect nor complete [8]. The increased iodine uptake reflects TSH stimulation and an intrinsic autoregulatory mechanism dependent on the intrathyroidal iodine concentration. The process of adjustment tends to decrease with time due to a continuous morphological deterioration of the thyroid, progressing from diffuse to multinodular hyperplasia when the goiter loses its adaptive efficiency.\nOxidative stress as a negative influence on thyroid hormone synthesis\nIn addition to being a substrate for hormone synthesis, H2O2 may be an important source of free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Since these elements may cause substantial damage and interfere with the normal cellular function, the epithelial cells of the thyroid seem to have an important defense mechanism against them in antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases, to counteract the potential damage mediated by free radicals. If this antioxidative defense is not effective, detectable damage (such as peroxidation) may occur in lipids, DNA, and thyrocyte proteins [21].\nAs iodine and H2O2 act as cosubstrates in thyroid hormone synthesis, changes in iodine concentrations are likely to affect the concentration of H2O2. The generation of H2O2, required for the incorporation of iodine, is also stimulated by TSH. Thus, low levels of iodine and increased thyroid function induce activation of H2O2, which may result in DNA damage and somatic mutations [29]. Consequently, low iodine and high H2O2 intensify the antioxidative defense, which may be detected in cellular regulation of enzymes involved in the defense against oxidative stress.\nIn fact, studies in rodents have demonstrated a higher expression of antioxidant enzymes, especially SOD3 (superoxide dismutase 3), which act preferentially in the follicular lumen. These enzymes are likely to shield the thyroid from the toxic effects of H2O2 metabolites and thereby protect the gland from DNA damage and somatic mutations induced by these products [30]. In addition, oxidative stress and antioxidative defenses are increased in the presence of gland hyperplasia and involution [22] .\nNodular transformation with progression to NNG\nMost goiters become nodular with time. Along with the hyperplasia caused by the decrease in iodine, there is an increase in functional activity accompanied by significant increase in the number of thyroid cells. This increase in cell replication hinders the repair process of the cell, favoring an excess of mutations in the thyroid that randomly affects genes crucial for the normal physiology of the thyrocyte. Mutations that confer a growth advantage, particularly in the gene encoding the TSH receptor or Gs\u03b1 protein, are the most likely initiators of focal growth [1].\nThe mechanism involved in the nodular transformation of a normal thyroid into a goiter may be hypothesized from epidemiological studies, animal models, and molecular data [1]. Initially, marginally low or deficient nutritional iodine and the concurrent action of goitrogens (see Tables 1, 2) cause diffuse thyroid hyperplasia. After this stage, increased cell proliferation, with possible DNA damage due to H2O2 action, cause mutational burden. Some of these spontaneous mutations induce constitutive (TSH-independent) activation of the cyclic AMP cascade, resulting in stimulation of growth and function. Finally, with the proliferation of cells in the thyroid, there is expression of growth-promoting factors, such as EGF (epidermal growth factor), IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1 or somatomedin C), FGF1 (fibroblast growth factor 1 [acidic]), and FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2 [basic]). As a result of the expression of these factors even at low concentration, the small clones with activating mutations continue to proliferate if capable of self-stimulation. They can then combine into small cell foci and develop as nodules. Nodular areas in the same gland exhibit different patterns of iodine uptake and cyclic AMP generation, confirming the presence of functional heterogeneity in NNGs [31] (Fig. 1).\nIn summary, the development of a nodule in an NNG is possibly the result of inherent and acquired heterogeneity in the proliferative and functional upregulation of thyroid follicular cells. These cells are intrinsically heterogeneous with regard to hormone production and proliferation in response to TSH stimulation. This is reflected in the different behaviors under intermediate levels of stimulation in which a subpopulation of cells outgrows others and expands into macroscopic nodules. In contrast, follicular cells acquiring activating somatic mutations in cell proliferation pathways can expand clonally and also develop into a nodule. About 60\u201370 % of the thyroid nodules develop through the later mechanism and are monoclonal in origin, as a result of a neoplastic process with somatic mutations as the starting point, although the precise gene abnormalities are unknown. Somatic mutations leading to constitutive activation of TSH receptors are found in about 60 % of autonomously functioning nodules. In the remaining 40 % of the functioning nodules, no mutation is found in the TSH receptor, and the genetic mechanisms involved are poorly understood.\nThe pathogenesis of NNG encompasses processes of diffuse follicular hyperplasia, focal nodular proliferation, and eventual acquisition of functional autonomy. The development of an NNG is a result of a presumed inborn error of thyroid hormone synthesis associated with long-term exposure of the thyroid to proliferative stimuli such as iodine deficiency, goitrogens, or other factors. All the above result in insufficient thyroid hormone production and stimulate pituitary secretion of TSH.\nNatural history\nThe natural history of the growth and function of the thyroid gland is variable and difficult to predict. In certain populations, the degree of spontaneous increase has been estimated at approximately 20 % per year, although this percentage may be much lower.\nIndividuals with NNG can present with hyperthyroidism or, less often, hypothyroidism. Hyperfunction often develops insidiously, in contrast to what is observed in Graves\u2019 disease. It generally starts with prolonged subclinical hyperthyroidism, characterized by low serum TSH and normal serum free T4, T3, and total T4 levels. This is a result of the growth of the goiter and is associated with the increase in the volume of cells producing thyroid hormones autonomously. The following observations support the concept of increasing thyroid nodularity and autonomy of thyroid function related to the increase in thyroid volume during the natural history of NNG: (a) the volume of the thyroid is greater in older subjects; (b) the longer the individual has a goiter, the larger the size of that goiter; and (c) the larger the size of the goiter, the lower the serum TSH concentration [32].\nThe rates of progression from a simple to a toxic NNG and the time that this takes to occur are poorly understood. A population study carried out in an iodine-deficient area showed that nodular autonomy increased with age and affected 15 % of the elderly [33]. According to some longitudinal studies, hyperthyroidism manifests in 9\u201310 % of the individuals with nodular goiter within a period of 7\u201312 years [34, 35]. In a few cases, the autonomy of some thyroid nodules may regress.\nIn contrast, the development of hypothyroidism in an individual with NNG is rare and often associated with coexisting autoimmune thyroiditis.\nDiagnostic approach in NNG and NDG\nClinical evaluation\nClinical signs and symptoms associated with NNG are shown in Table 3, and the diagnostic aspects related to the disease are depicted in Table 4.\nThe occurrence of symptoms of compression of cervical structures (trachea, great vessels, and recurrent laryngeal nerve) is almost always an indication that a long-term NNG has partially migrated to the retrosternal and upper mediastinal regions (Table 2). This occurs more frequently in individuals older than 40\u201350 years, possibly due to changes in the cervical spine (decreased vertebral spaces, vertebral listhesis, and, possibly, cervical osteoporosis) projecting parts of the NNG toward the retrosternal region. When this occurs, the goiter may compress the jugular and subclavian veins in the area around the superior vena cava.\nIn the Pemberton maneuver, dislocation of a goiter into the upper thoracic aperture obtained by extension of the arms above the head may cause respiratory difficulty, distension of the neck veins, facial congestion, and stridor due to increased pressure on the trachea (Pemberton\u2019s sign) [36]. This phenomenon seems to be uncommon. In the medical literature, description of tracheal compression triggering cough or stridor is reported in about 18 % of the individuals with large NNGs [37]. Thoracic inlet imaging is often requested in patients with retrosternal goiter after a finding of extra-thoracic airway obstruction in a flow-volume loop spirometry or a mediastinal shadow causing tracheal deviation on chest X-ray. Very often, computed tomography (CT) images show a decrease in more than 50 % in the tracheal segment due to compression in the absence of complaints or discomfort. Other findings may include esophageal involvement, vocal cord paralysis, phrenic nerve palsy, and Horner\u2019s syndrome due to damage to the cervical sympathetic chain [38]. In rare instances when an NNG becomes malignant, symptoms of compression, shortness of breath, and a persistent cough that worsens in the recumbent position should alert for the possibility of malignancy.\nIt is important to emphasize that hyperthyroidism may develop as an NNG increases progressively in size. This dysfunction is almost always caused by excessive iodine exposure, such as excessive dietary iodine, accidental ingestion of drugs containing iodine, use of povidone as an anti-bactericidal agent, dermal application of iodine, and use of cosmetics containing red dye (which is iodized) [39].\nIn hyperthyroidism secondary to excessive dietary iodine intake, thyrotoxicosis develops acutely. In contrast, the development is often insidious in long-term NNGs, in which hyperthyroidism occurs due to the development of autonomous thyroid nodules [40]. Since the occurrence of hyperthyroidism in this setting usually affects the elderly, cardiac arrhythmia is commonly the initial presentation, particularly in the form of atrial fibrillation. In some individuals, scintigraphy may show a dominant hyperfunctioning (autonomous or \u201chot\u201d) nodule. In others, heterogeneous distribution of the radionuclide is more commonly observed. Thyroid scintigraphy is usually the method of choice to confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in NNG caused by excess iodine, in which a very low isotope uptake by the thyroid is demonstrated.\nDuring the clinical assessment, affected individuals should be asked about the familial occurrence of benign or malignant thyroid disease.\nThe problem of malignancy in NNGs\nThe risk of malignancy in a nodule within a multinodular goiter has not been completely elucidated. Recent guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules recommend the screening to be based on the assumption that the risk of malignancy in a nodule within a multinodular goiter is comparable to that in single nodules [7]. However, evidence from individual studies shows that the reported prevalence of thyroid malignancy in patients with NNG varies between 4 and 17 %. These high prevalences may be due to inclusion of incidental papillary cancers detected on surgical specimens. [41\u201343], in contrast to an estimated prevalence of 5 % in those with a single nodule [44]. This shows a great discrepancy between these rates, which may be due to the selection process of the patients. The histological criteria for malignancy are also variable, and it is notably difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the growth potential of a particular lesion. These carcinomas vary widely in size and are typically papillary and well differentiated; therefore, their prognosis is remarkably good, with a reported survival of 95 % in 30 years [45]. These aspects should be taken into account when conservative therapy is under consideration.\nA family history of NNG suggests the occurrence of a benign disease but does not exclude the possibility of malignancy. It is important to obtain information on the occurrence of familial papillary carcinoma, which would indicate the need for better and more comprehensive laboratory and cytological investigation.\nThe risk of malignancy in NNGs is higher in young individuals and in the elderly [2]. A history of ionizing radiation in the cervical region during childhood should alert to the possibility of a papillary carcinoma. Likewise, a more evident growth of part of an NNG should alert to the possibility of malignancy. In contrast, a rapid increase in volume in a cyst, or the presence of a hemorrhagic area can be easily diagnosed by ultrasonography.\nThyroidectomy should be considered irrespective of a benign cytology in cases with a high clinical suspicion of malignancy evidenced by rapid tumor growth, unusual nodular induration, adherence to adjacent structures, vocal cord paralysis at laryngoscopy, and regional lymphadenopathy [2].\nLaboratory assessment\nInitial laboratory tests most often requested are serum TSH and free T4. This practice is consistent with the recommendations and preferences of experts in the United States and Europe (Table 5).\nMeasurement of these hormones assesses the function in an NNG and evaluates the possibility of subclinical hyperthyroidism. The presence of positive anti-thyroid peroxidase (antiTPO) and antiTG antibodies reflects concomitant autoimmune thyroid disease [2]. Levels of TG are consistently high and correlate with the size of the NNG, but add little information from a diagnostic point of view. It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss the role of measurement of calcitonin to rule out medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in an NNG. International studies offer no consensus on this issue and in our opinion this investigation is not justified due to the large number of individuals with NNG, and considering the high cost of the test and the low prevalence of MTC (0.4\u20131.4 %) [46].\nImaging investigation\nInspection and palpation of the thyroid by the clinician are the initial steps in the investigation of an NNG. This should include a careful description of the features of the nodules, position, texture, signs of calcification, areas with possible recent and painful hemorrhage, and signs of venous compression or tracheal compression in the supine position. However, clinical evaluation of NNGs is rather inaccurate, particularly when the NNG extends to the retrosternal and mediastinal regions. Therefore, this evaluation should be followed by an imaging assessment to correlate the clinical information with data obtained from imaging tests.\nUltrasonography\nRoutine assessment of the thyroid with ultrasonography (in association with the analysis of the vascularization with color Doppler) had a great impact in endocrinology practice [47]. This methodology is widely disseminated due to the greater availability of high-resolution equipment, relatively affordable devices, little or no discomfort for the patient, and the absence of ionizing radiation. Additionally, it provides valuable information about the nodules (presence of halo, microcalcifications, echogenicity, location, volume), and offers precise directions for sample collection by fine-needle aspiration (FNA). It is then not a surprise that 80 % of the endocrinologists choose this resource for initial imaging assessment in patients with NNG.\nHowever, it is necessary to stress that ultrasonography is a procedure dependent on the observer, in which professionals with greater experience and larger number of patients will have a better diagnostic ability when compared with inexperienced ones. Due to that, divergent reports issued by different diagnostic centers are common. Also, experts disagree on the role of ultrasound to identify malignant features in thyroid nodules. In our view, the use of already established criteria such as the absence of a halo, undefined borders, presence of microcalcifications, marked hypoechogenicity, and central vascular flow at Doppler evaluation may indicate the need to complement the assessment with a cytological analysis [47]. Reported mean specificities for predicting malignancy are 67 % for marked hypoechogenicity, 70 % for microcalcifications (small, intranodular, punctate, hyperechoic spots with scanty or no posterior acoustic shadowing), 70 % for irregular or microlobulated margins, and about 80 % for chaotic arrangement or intranodular vascular images [48, 49]. The value of these features for predicting cancer is partially blunted by low sensitivity attributed to these findings, but no ultrasonographic feature alone is entirely predictive of malignancy [50]. Moreover, certain ultrasonographic features may be suggestive at best, but are not a proof of malignancy.\nUltrasonography allows a precise assessment of the volume of an NNG, providing the gland does not extend behind the sternum or to the upper mediastinum. If carried out by the same investigator, volumetric variations can be detected, which may lead to medical or surgical intervention.\nThere is a lack of clinical criteria for malignancy in most nonpalpable nodules [51, 52]. Hence, it is essential to determine which thyroid lesions have a high potential for malignancy based on ultrasonographic features. The prevalence of cancer detected by ultrasonographic characteristics suggestive of malignancy in nonpalpable thyroid nodules is similar to that in palpable nodules [49, 53]. The occurrence of malignancy is not less frequent in nodules smaller than 10 mm in diameter than in those larger than that. Therefore, an arbitrary diameter cutoff for cancer risk is not justified, and suspicious lesions smaller than 10 mm should be assessed with FNA biopsy when warranted [50]. Since an aggressive disease course is rare in incidentally discovered microcarcinomas [54], incidental thyroid lesions with a diameter of about 5 mm are usually followed up with ultrasonography [55]. There is no evidence that surgical intervention in nonpalpable nodules is associated with health improvement in affected individuals.\nIn comparative studies assessing medium to large NNGs, the accuracy of ultrasonography is lower than that of CT, particularly when part of the thyroid tissue is retrosternal.\nScintigraphy\nThyroid imaging with radionuclides (radioiodine and technetium) has been performed for many years. However, as a method to assess volumetric and morphological features, scintigraphy leaves much to be desired when compared with ultrasonography.\nScintigraphy is useful to evaluate the functional status of the nodules in an NNG, identifying nodules with high uptake of radionuclide along with others with scarce radioactive concentration. The use of 99Tc (technetium) as a tracer may be associated with a false-positive uptake in 3\u20138 % of the nodules, which does not occur with radioiodine [56]. Evidently, the presence of subclinical or clinical hyperthyroidism should raise the suspicion of hyperfunctioning autonomous nodule in the context of multinodularity and, in this situation, scintigraphy may be useful for diagnostic purposes.\nComputed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron-emission tomography (PET)\nThese methods provide high-resolution, three-dimensional visualization of the thyroid gland. However, due to a high dose of ionizing radiation, there is no advantage in performing CT routinely in NNGs, except in glands with retrosternal or upper mediastinal extension, which are not adequately visualized by ultrasonography. Another role of CT is on the follow-up after treatment with radioiodine preceded by recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) to determine with accuracy the volumetric reduction of retrosternal NNGs [56]. Use of iodinated contrast during CT should be avoided due to the risk of the Jod-Basedow phenomenon. Regarding MRI, there is a lack of comparative and accurate studies with reliable conclusions about the use of this method when compared with CT. In the routine assessment of NNGs in hospitals and clinics, MRI has a limited role for the assessment of nodular volume or characteristics.\nPositron-emission tomography with radioactive fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) should also not be used for evaluation of an NNG, although some reports have shown it to be useful in solitary solid nodules, in which this method may indicate the possibility of malignancy [57].\nFine-needle aspiration biopsy\nThis procedure provides direct and accurate information on the cytology of a single nodule. In individuals with NNG, malignant nodules are mostly indistinguishable from benign ones from a clinical point of view. Therefore, a consensus based on several recommendations of associations from Europe and North America is to perform an FNA biopsy of at least two nodules according to previous ultrasonographic findings associated with malignancy [58]. The coexistence of two or more suspicious ultrasonographic findings greatly increases the possibility of thyroid cancer. Also, in the presence of suspicious cervical lymphadenopathy, FNA biopsy of both the lymph node and the suspicious nodule(s) is essential.\nTherapeutic options\nOnce the diagnosis of NDG or NNG is established, the following management goals should be considered:\n-\n(a)\nCorrect the underlying thyroid dysfunction, if present;\n-\n(b)\nVerify if the goiter is growing or causing obstructive symptoms;\n-\n(c)\nExclude malignancy if one or more nodules are suspicious;\n-\n(d)\nDetermine whether the goiter requires therapy and if so, weight the benefits and risks of medical and surgical interventions and reach a decision with the patient about what type of treatment should be administered.\nThe decision of how to treat an individual with benign nontoxic goiter can be difficult, especially since there is no uniform association between the size of the goiter and the presence of symptoms.\nNontoxic diffuse goiter\nTreatment of patients with NDG, when considered to be indicated, is medical rather than surgical. It is unclear whether or not the early treatment of NDG can inhibit the development of nodular goiter [59].\nAs discussed previously, NDG results from a combination of genetic factors and environmental conditions. Prolonged stimulation by TSH, which frequently results from iodine deficiency, is considered an important factor for thyroid enlargement. Therefore, iodine supplementation in this situation would seem an adequate approach. In fact, supplementation with iodine 400 \u00b5g/day for 8\u201312 months has been demonstrated to be as effective as suppressive therapy with LT4 150 \u03bcg/day [60]. However, except in a few European countries, iodine is no longer used for the treatment of benign nontoxic goiter.\nIn contrast, a beneficial effect of LT4 has been shown in NDG [61]. If suppressive treatment is considered, then administration of thyroid hormone in enough doses to inhibit or reduce TSH secretion may be used. However, it should be considered that the volume of the goiter returns to pretreatment size after LT4 withdrawal.\nNontoxic nodular goiter\nThere is no consensus on the ideal treatment for NNG, due in part to the variable natural history associated with the disease. In some individuals, the goiter increases gradually in size over time and is accompanied by the development of multiple nodules, compressive symptoms, and cosmetic concerns [2]. However, in about 20 % of the women and 5 % of the men, the goiter stabilizes or regresses spontaneously over time [6].\nOptions for management of NNG include:\n-\nClinical observation for asymptomatic patients;\n-\nThyroid hormone suppressive therapy;\n-\nRadioiodine therapy alone or preceded by rhTSH; and\n-\nSurgery.\nAmong these options, treatment is chosen individually for each patient in view of the risks, benefits, and availability of the various techniques, experience of the treating physician, and patient\u2019s personal preference.\nClinical observation\nObservation alone may be appropriate in individuals with normal thyroid function, who are asymptomatic, and without cosmetic concerns after the diagnosis of benign nontoxic goiter is established by clinical evaluation, and laboratory and thyroid imaging tests. In general, individuals with asymptomatic NNG may be followed yearly with careful palpation of the thyroid and serum TSH measurement. If the findings on palpation are unclear, ultrasonography may be indicated. Nodules that appear to be growing may require FNAB. Neck CT or MRI may be necessary if the goiter extends to the retrosternal area.\nLevothyroxine suppressive therapy\nManagement of NNG with thyroid hormone is controversial. According to surveys, suppressive therapy with LT4 is used extensively in the United States, Europe, and Latin America (Table 6) [62]. The efficacy of LT4 depends on the degree of TSH suppression. Since most patients with NNG have normal serum TSH concentration, thyroid enlargement in these patients is probably caused by several growth factors (including TSH) acting over time on thyroid follicular cells with different synthetic and growth potentials.\nPotential adverse effects are more noticeable in older patients, who comprise the larger proportion of individuals with NNG. In addition, up to 22 % of the affected individuals may have important functional autonomy rendering LT4 therapy more problematic due to an increased risk of bone loss and atrial fibrillation.\nWhen suppressive therapy with LT4 is initiated, long-term treatment is required. Thyroid hormone is presumed to reduce goiter size in some individuals by reducing TSH secretion, particularly in those from regions with borderline or low iodine intake. Since any reduction in NNG size during therapy is lost once LT4 is withdrawn, there is a possibility of recurrence of nodular and/or glandular growth [63]. However, the maintenance of serum TSH level in the lower end of or just below the normal range, rather than below 0.01 \u00b5U/mL, appears to be efficacious. Pending further study, this strategy may relieve the adverse effects of LT4 therapy [64].\nA potential benefit of thyroid hormone therapy is a reduction in the risk of thyroid oncogenesis [65]. However, this hypothesis is still speculative, and additional studies are still required.\nOverall, since LT4 suppressive therapy is associated with a reduction in the volume of NNGs in only about 30 % of the patients, the choice of this treatment modality has declined [2].\nSurgery\nThe optimal surgical procedure for NNG is still debated. When surgery is the treatment of choice, total thyroidectomy is recommended over subtotal thyroidectomy for most patients with large obstructive goiters, cosmetic complaints, or retrosternal NNGs [66, 67]. Subtotal thyroidectomy is associated with higher recurrence rates than total thyroidectomy, requiring reintervention in 2.5\u201342 % of the patients over the long term. Also, 3.5 % of the patients with NNG treated with subtotal thyroidectomy require a second procedure to remove all thyroid tissue due to incidental thyroid cancer [68]. Both total and subtotal techniques have similar rates of permanent complications such as hypoparathyroidism and vocal palsy, but total thyroidectomy is preferred since the risk of these complications increases with reintervention [69]. In patients with unilateral NNG, some authors recommend unilateral thyroidectomy based on a low rate of recurrence (2 %) and high rate of maintenance of euthyroidism (73 %) [70]. Postsurgical recurrence rates are directly proportional to the volume of the remaining thyroid tissue.\nUsually, intrathoracic goiters can be approached through a cervical incision, although it has been reported that 10\u201330 % of the cases require sternotomy or thoracotomy [71]. The complication rates are higher in individuals with NNG with retrosternal extension when compared with individuals whose goiters are located exclusively in the cervical area [72].\nTotal thyroidectomy should be followed by LT4 replacement therapy at a dose of 1.4\u20132.2 \u00b5g/kg/day [73]. Appropriate adjustments should be made following routine recommendations for patients with hypothyroidism. If partial thyroidectomy is chosen, LT4 should only be started after the development of hypothyroidism, and not as a preventive measure against goiter recurrence since randomized trials have failed to confirm such benefit [74].\nSince the incidence of NNG increases with age, the benefits of surgery must be carefully weighed against possible risks associated with the procedure, especially in the elderly who may present substantial comorbidity. Alternatively, radioiodine preceded by rhTSH stimulation may be an option, as discussed below in this section.\nRadioiodine therapy\nRadioiodine therapy is recommended for NNG patients with contraindication for or refusal of surgery. This treatment modality in nodular goiter has increased in recent years and results in a considerable reduction in thyroid volume, with rates of 30\u201340 % in the first year, and 50\u201360 % on the fourth year. Most individuals report improvement of obstructive symptoms [75], with reports of a single dose administered orally restoring euthyroidism over a period of 2\u20134 months [56].\nThe larger the volume of the gland and the lower the radioiodine uptake, the higher should be the radioiodine activity to be administered. Subsequent studies have unanimously confirmed this concept [76]. In very large goiters (>100 cm3), the decrease in glandular volume is lower (around 35 %) despite the use of equivalent doses of radioiodine [76].\nRecombinant human TSH-stimulated radioiodine therapy\nA frequent limitation of the treatment with radioiodine is the low accumulation level of the isotope in inactive and partially suppressed paranodular areas in NNGs. This problem may be solved by increasing the radioiodine uptake (RAIU) in such nodular goiters [77]. For this purpose, recent studies using rhTSH in preparation for radioiodine therapy have shown good results [78].\nTherapy with rhTSH in combination with radioiodine is well tolerated and is associated with similar side effects as those observed when the radioiodine is administered alone. However, in the first 48 h after radioiodine therapy, there is a brief elevation in thyroid hormone levels causing transient mild thyrotoxicosis followed by possible hypothyroidism within the first month after the treatment [79, 80]. Other observed acute adverse effects are painful transient thyroiditis, thyroid swelling, tracheal compression, and, frequently, cardiac symptoms. These conditions may be minimized by the use of glucocorticoids and \u03b2-blockers [81].\nSeveral recent articles [77] have indicated that these adverse effects are probably dose-dependent and are negligible with lower rhTSH doses. According to Bonnema et al. [77], the optimal dose of rhTSH to improve radioiodine therapy is most likely in the range of 0.03\u20130.1 mg. Significant improvement in RAIU by the thyroid is obtained in this dose range, with minimization of the risk of glandular swelling and temporary thyrotoxicosis.\nAn interesting, diverse approach to increasing the thyroid RAIU is to stimulate the secretion of endogenous TSH with methimazole [82]. However, whether a marginal hypothyroid state obtained with methimazole is as effective as rhTSH to increase the thyroid RAIU and to augment the reduction in goiter size after radioiodine therapy remains to be clarified with controlled trials.\nTable 7 shows different situations associated with a multinodular goiter and the recommended therapy (surgery or radioiodine) for each of them.\nIn summary, individuals with NDG should receive clinical rather than surgical treatment. NNG is a highly prevalent disease, even in regions without iodine deficiency. Many individuals are asymptomatic, and when symptoms are present, the most common clinical manifestations result from local compressive effects. Affected individuals should undergo a detailed investigation in order to rule out malignancy. When that is achieved, therapeutic modalities should be individualized weighing the risk/benefit of each option and discussed with patients. Total thyroidectomy is the first treatment option, followed by the use of radioiodine alone or after rhTSH pretreatment to increase the efficacy of the radioiodine treatment.\nThe efficacy of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy in NNG is questionable, and its use has declined due to concerns about potential long-term side effects associated with the induction of subclinical hyperthyroidism and the fact that most goiters increase in volume again after discontinuation of the thyroid hormone. Each of these therapeutic options has advantages and disadvantages, with acute and long-term side effects.\nFinal remarks\nApart from local signs and possible progression with time to subclinical or overt thyrotoxicosis, there is no extrathyroidal involvement in NDG and NNG like the occurrence of ophthalmopathy in Graves\u2019 disease. The local signs associated with NDG and NNG are those of any other space-occupying tumors in the area of the upper thoracic outlet.\nSporadic NNG is not usually considered a predisposition to thyroid cancer, although it may hinder the detection of malignancy. Accelerated growth of a solitary nodule within any goiter is the single most alarming sign, although even entirely benign nodules may grow rapidly.\nNeck palpation is well-known to be an imprecise assessment to evaluate the morphology and determine the size of the thyroid. In contrast, high-resolution ultrasonography is the most sensitive method to detect thyroid nodules. Both CT and MRI have no advantage over ultrasonography for visualization of the intrathyroidal structure and are not recommended for routine evaluations. Their major strength is their ability to assess patients with large goiters with suspected retrosternal extension, or obstructive or compressive symptoms. Scintigraphy with iodine isotopes may be unsuitable because of the frequent lack of uptake in different areas of large nodular goiters.\nThe goals of management are to correct the underlying thyroid dysfunction, if present, and to decrease the size or prevent further growth of goiter. In the absence of adequate randomized trial data, management decisions should be individualized based upon patient characteristics. Many patients with benign but large goiters may experience clinical symptoms of pressure, such as dysphagia, choking sensation, or airway obstruction. These patients often require surgery to mitigate their symptoms. In the absence of malignancy, asymptomatic patients may be observed. The effectiveness of treatment with LT4 to reduce the volume of the goiter remains controversial. Radioactive iodine alone or with rhTSH is safe and effective and may be a reasonable therapeutic option.\nWhat is the optimal treatment for benign NDG and NNG goiters? Once the diagnosis and indication for treatment of nontoxic goiter has been made, the treating physician and patient should discuss each of the treatment options, including the logistics, benefits, expected speed of recovery, drawbacks, side effects, costs and then decide on the best treatment modality for that particular patient, taking into account the patient\u2019s age and comorbidities.\nReferences\nStuder H, Peter HJ, Gerber H (1989) Natural heterogeneity of thyroid cells: the basis for understanding thyroid function and nodular goiter.

      "text": "A Deeper Look at Shin Splints (Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome)\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Shin splints, or Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome (MTSS), are a stress injury to the shinbone (tibia) from overuse.\n- Common causes include sudden increases in training, improper footwear, and biomechanical issues like flat feet.\n- Treatment focuses on rest and addressing the root cause, not just the pain.\n- Prevention involves gradual training progression, supportive shoes, and strengthening lower leg and core muscles.\n- Despite being common, high-quality research on the best prevention and treatment methods is still limited.\nLet\u2019s be honest. \u201cShin splints\u201d is kind of an inaccurate diagnosis. It\u2019s a vague term for a very specific pain: that nagging, hot ache along the inner edge of your shinbone. We call it medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) in the clinic, which sounds much more impressive, but it often just means \u201cyour shin hurts and we need to figure out why\u201d [1]. It\u2019s one of the most common things we see. And one of the most frustrating.\nFor a long time, the accepted wisdom was that muscles were getting inflamed and pulling on the bone. That theory is mostly out the window now. The real story seems to be about the bone itself. Your tibia. Under repetitive pounding from running or jumping, that bone starts to bend. Just a tiny, microscopic amount. But do that a few thousand times, and the bone gets tired. It can\u2019t repair itself as fast as it\u2019s being stressed. That\u2019s the real problem. It\u2019s a bone stress injury [8].\nThink of a paperclip. Bend it once, it\u2019s fine. Bend it a thousand times in the same spot, and it gets weak. It\u2019s about to break. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening in your leg. This isn\u2019t just trivia. It\u2019s critical. Because if the bone itself is crying for help, the next stop down the line is a full-on stress fracture [7]. The pain gives us a clue: shin splint pain is usually spread out along the bone, while a fracture often hurts in one specific, pinpoint spot [8]. But sometimes, that line gets very blurry.\nWhat\u2019s Really Causing the Breakdown?\nSo, why is the bone getting so overworked? It\u2019s never just one thing. It\u2019s a pile-up. A perfect storm of little failures.\nThe number one culprit? Almost always, it\u2019s load management [3]. That\u2019s just a fancy way of saying you did too much, too soon. You felt good one week, so you doubled your mileage. You decided to train for a 10k in a month with no prep. Your heart might be able to cash that check, but your skeleton can\u2019t. Bone needs time to adapt and get stronger. It remodels based on stress, but it needs rest to do it [10]. You have to earn your mileage.\nBut your training schedule isn\u2019t the only villain. Other things conspire to lower your shin\u2019s breaking point. Let\u2019s talk about your feet. Do they roll inward a lot when you run? That\u2019s called pronation, and too much of it can put a twisting force on the tibia [4][9]. Now, combine that with worn-out shoes that have all the support of a wet paper towel [1]. Or running exclusively on hard pavement [2].\nSuddenly, the load on that one bone is magnified. And what if your hips and core muscles are weak? Then your body can\u2019t stabilize itself properly, and even more shock gets sent straight down to your lower legs [3]. You end up with this long checklist of things to look for. It feels like being a detective. Is it the shoes? The weak glutes? The fact you run on the same slanted side of the road every day? Yes. It\u2019s probably a little bit of all of it.\nThe Path to Recovery (and Staying There)\nSo how do we fix it? The first step is the one nobody likes. Rest. Shut it down. If your bone is getting beat up, you have to stop beating it up [5]. It\u2019s that simple. Ice can calm down the fire, but it won\u2019t rebuild the bone. That only happens with time off.\nBut rest alone is a trap. Because the pain will go away. And you\u2019ll go right back to doing what you were doing before, and the whole cycle will start over. The real work is playing back the tape and fixing the why. This is the hard part.\nRemember that foot-rolling-in thing? This is where good shoes or maybe even an orthotic insert can make a world of difference for some people [6]. That weak core and those sleepy hip muscles? That\u2019s where physical therapy comes in. Not just stretching, but hard work. Getting stronger so your whole body can absorb force better, instead of funneling it all into your shins [4]. As for those fancy treatments like shockwave therapy? The jury is still out. Some studies show it might help, but it\u2019s not a magic wand [6]. It can\u2019t fix a bad training plan.\nUltimately, you have to stop thinking about your shin and start thinking about the whole system. The pain is just the end result. It\u2019s the final, desperate message from a system that\u2019s overloaded. The question you should be asking isn\u2019t, \u201cHow do I make my shin stop hurting?\u201d It should be, \u201cWhat in my training, my body, or my gear is causing this breakdown?\u201d Answering that question is the only way to fix the problem for good.\nReferences\n[1] Bhusari, N., & Deshmukh, M.

      "text": "How Wearable Tech and Telehealth Are Revolutionizing Chronic Disease Care\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Wearables paired with telehealth can significantly improve outcomes for chronic conditions like heart disease.\n- Effective programs require condition-specific devices (e.g., CGMs, ECGs) and secure, HIPAA-compliant data transmission.\n- Benefits include earlier detection of complications, reduced ER visits, and enhanced patient engagement.\n- Key barriers to adoption are data interoperability, patient privacy, the digital divide, and proving cost-effectiveness.\n- Future strategies involve standardizing technology and using AI to create predictive health models from wearable data.\nFor millions living with chronic conditions like diabetes or heart failure, managing daily life can feel like a full time job. It\u2019s a never-ending cycle of tracking symptoms, checking vitals and traveling to appointments. What if we could take care beyond the clinic walls and create a continuous connection between you and your care team? With a mobile device or smartphone and internet access, patients can stay connected to their care providers remotely, get care anytime and access digital information and telehealth services.\nThat\u2019s what wearable technology and telehealth is all about. It\u2019s not a trend, it\u2019s a fundamental shift in how we manage chronic disease. By combining the real time data from wearables with the accessibility of virtual care \u2013 including a virtual visit as a telehealth service \u2013 we can create a proactive, personalized and powerful way to manage health.\nTable of Contents\n- A New Era of Connected Care\n- The Core Components of a Successful Program\n- Beyond the Hype: Proven Clinical Benefits\n- Putting It All Together: A Focus on Heart Failure and Diabetes\n- Navigating the Barriers to Widespread Adoption\n- The Future is Proactive, Not Reactive\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nA New Era of Connected Care\nNot so long ago wearables were just for fitness enthusiasts. Now medical grade devices are health monitors. Wearable devices like smartwatches like the Apple Watch use advanced electronics and embedded sensors to track vital signs like heart rate and can send notifications to both the user and the healthcare provider. When paired with telehealth platforms they create a stream of objective real-time physiological data.\nAs a 2024 American Heart Association scientific statement says this connected approach can make a big difference when done thoughtfully [1]. Instead of relying on snapshots of your health from office visits, your clinician can see the whole picture \u2013 how your body is responding to treatment day in and day out. Computers, tablets and other technology collect and display health data so providers can check in on patients remotely and provide timely support.\nThis turns care from reactive to proactive, allowing for early interventions that can prevent complications down the line; the types of wearables and telehealth services vary and these technologies are used by everyone from coaches in sports to monitor and improve health outcomes.\nThe Core Components of a Successful Program\nJust giving a patient a device isn\u2019t enough. A good program is built on a foundation of chosen technology and strong support systems. Here are the basics:\n- Condition-Specific Devices: The right tool for the job. This means CGMs for diabetes, wearable ECGs and smartwatches for atrial fibrillation, smart scales and blood pressure cuffs for heart failure. Telehealth services include remote monitoring, virtual consultations and digital health solutions that address the individual\u2019s unique needs by providing personalized care and support.\n- Secure Data Transmission: Patient data is sensitive. You need to use encrypted, HIPAA compliant protocols to get the data from the device to the telehealth dashboard. The data should be visualized so clinicians can see trends and act fast [1] [2].\n- Customizable Alerts: An avalanche of data is useless without a system to flag what\u2019s important. Good platforms have customizable alerts for each patient; notifications can be sent to both the patient and care team to check for urgent issues. For example the system can alert the care team if the patient\u2019s glucose levels spike or their blood oxygen saturation drops below a certain threshold [3].\n- Patient Training and Support: Technology can be scary. Onboarding is non-negotiable. This means hands on training with the device, education on how to read the data and clear steps to troubleshoot so patients feel confident and engaged. Patients may need to fill out digital forms and sign in to telehealth platforms using a computer, tablet or mobile device and remote support is available to help with efficient onboarding [4].\nBeyond the Hype: Proven Clinical Benefits\nWhen these work together, the benefits are real for patients and providers.\n- Better Clinical Outcomes: Continuous monitoring allows for early detection of subtle changes that may indicate a worsening condition, often before the patient even feels symptoms. Fewer ED visits and hospitalizations [1]. More precise medication adjustments during virtual visits as clinicians have objective data to make decisions. Virtual visits allow providers to check in on patients remotely and make timely adjustments for conditions like depression, anxiety and other mental health concerns [2] [3].\n- Patient Engagement: When you can see the impact of your diet, exercise and medication on your own health metrics, it\u2019s powerful. This gives you control and encourages adherence to treatment plans. It turns care into a partnership, supporting shared decision making between you and your provider.\n- Data Driven Personalization: Wearable data gives you an objective view of what\u2019s happening inside your body, complementing the symptoms you report. Reduces clinical guesswork and helps tailor therapy with more precision [1].\nFor the best telehealth experience, here are some tips: make sure your technology is ready before your virtual visit, prepare your questions in advance and check your internet connection. Examples of remote care include using wearables to get ongoing support for mental health, chronic conditions and regular health checks.\nPutting It All Together: A Focus on Heart Failure and Diabetes\nLet\u2019s look at two conditions where this is already happening: heart failure and diabetes. Research shows that managing multiple connected metrics\u2014blood glucose, blood pressure, atrial fibrillation\u2014can reduce the risk of developing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) [6]. Wearables can track vital signs like heart rate and detect falls so patients can stay connected to their care team and get support anytime.\nAnd the benefits of monitoring blood sugar aren\u2019t just for diabetics. One study found continuous glucose monitoring can improve outcomes in non-diabetic heart failure patients who experience glycemic dysregulation (unstable blood sugar). This shows how digital information from wearables can address hidden risk factors and impact patient outcomes. Examples are remote monitoring of vital signs and tracking changes so care can be more personalized.\nNavigating the Barriers to Widespread Adoption\nThis model isn\u2019t a magic bullet. Several hurdles must be cleared for it to become standard of care.\n- Data Quality and Interoperability: Not all devices are created equal and data must be accurate and flow seamlessly between different EHR systems [4].\n- Privacy and Security: Health info is sacred. Robust encryption and transparent patient consent is key to building and maintaining trust [5].\n- The Digital Divide: We can\u2019t make these tools worse. We must create programs that provide equal access through subsidized devices, inclusive education and support for those with limited digital literacy. Lack of internet or mobile devices can prevent consumers from getting telehealth services and solutions must address these barriers so everyone can benefit from these technologies.\n- Busting the Cost Myth: The myth is that telehealth and wearables will immediately cut healthcare costs. While that can happen, the focus should be on long term value and quality of life. As one scoping review notes, short term system wide cost savings aren\u2019t guaranteed [7]. For example, the cost and access to telehealth services can vary for different consumers over a period of time and assistance programs along with new technologies can help people stay connected to care.\nThe Future is Proactive, Not Reactive\nThe work ahead is to refine the technology and the systems that support it. Emerging tech and efficient use of digital info will shape the future of telehealth and make healthcare more streamlined and accessible. We need universal standards for device accuracy and interoperability [4]. We need more research into long term outcomes and patient reported experiences to get the full ROI.\nLooking ahead the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is exciting. By feeding wearable data and other digital info into predictive models we may be able to forecast health crises before they happen and have truly proactive care strategies [1].\nLearn more about upcoming telehealth and wearable tech here and stay up to date.\nClosing Thoughts\nWearable technology and telehealth is more than a nice to have \u2013 it\u2019s a game changer for chronic disease management. It\u2019s a way to get more precise, personalized and empowering care that puts you the patient at the centre. But to get there we need to approach this with thought and prioritise security, equity and usability. When done right this connected care model can change lives by turning data into life saving insights.\nThis article is for information only and not medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions about your health or treatment.\nReferences\n[1] Armoundas, A. A., Narayan, S. M., Arnett, D.

      "text": "Uterine Fibroids: Why Is the Most Common Tumor Still Such a Puzzle?\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women, affecting up to 70% of white women and over 80% of Black women by menopause.\n- Symptoms can include heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, and infertility, but many women have no symptoms at all.\n- Fibroid growth is linked to hormones like estrogen and progesterone, as well as specific genetic mutations (MED12, HMGA2).\n- A recent Mendelian randomization study found no causal link between uterine fibroids and cardiovascular disease, correcting a long-held assumption.\n- Treatment is becoming more personalized, moving beyond hysterectomy to include options like uterine artery embolization (UAE), myomectomy, and emerging non-hormonal therapies.\nHere\u2019s the thing about uterine fibroids that\u2019s so maddening. For a condition that\u2019s arguably one of the most common on the planet, our answers for it have historically been terrible. Just awful. We\u2019re talking about benign tumors\u2014knots of muscle and fibrous tissue in the uterine wall\u2014that show up in most women [1]. By menopause, up to 70% of white women have them. For Black women, it\u2019s over 80% [3] [11]. That\u2019s not a bug; it\u2019s a feature of female biology for a huge portion of the population.\nAnd yet, the experience is a total lottery.\nSome women have them and feel nothing. Zero. But for others, they completely hijack their lives. The bleeding can be relentless, leading to iron-deficiency anemia that leaves you exhausted [2]. The pelvic pain and pressure can feel like a constant, dull weight. A fibroid pressing on the bladder means you\u2019re always looking for a bathroom. Pressing on the bowel means constipation [7]. And for women trying to start a family, they can be a disaster, contributing to infertility or miscarriage [4].\nSo you have this incredibly common thing, a single cell in the uterine wall that goes rogue and starts cloning itself [5]. We know what fuels it. The body\u2019s own hormones, estrogen and progesterone, act like gasoline on a fire [6]. We even know some of the genetic typos, like in the MED12 gene, that kick things off [5]. It\u2019s a perfect storm of genes, hormones, and other factors like age. But knowing the cause and knowing what to do about it are two very different things.\nFor years, the clinical playbook was frustratingly simple. If the symptoms weren\u2019t too bad, you\u2019d be told to \u201cwatch and wait.\u201d If they were wrecking your life, the solution was often a hysterectomy [7]. Remove the whole uterus. Problem solved. A definitive answer, sure, but a massive, irreversible one. It\u2019s a sledgehammer approach.\nThat\u2019s finally changing. The goal now is to preserve the uterus if possible.\nFirst, you need a good map. A basic ultrasound is step one, but an MRI is the real GPS. It shows exactly where every fibroid is, how big it is, and what it\u2019s pushing against [10]. That map is everything because it opens the door to smarter, more targeted treatments. Instead of the sledgehammer, we can now use a scalpel. A myomectomy, for instance, is surgery to remove just the fibroids. It works, but it\u2019s still surgery.\nA less invasive option that\u2019s become a go-to is uterine artery embolization (UAE). It\u2019s clever. A radiologist goes in through a tiny puncture and blocks the specific arteries feeding the fibroids. Starved of their blood supply, the fibroids shrink and die [8].\nA recent, more sophisticated study using genetic data\u2014a method called Mendelian randomization\u2014blew that idea out of the water. It found no causal link. None [9]. This is incredibly important. It means we don\u2019t have to put women through needless worry or extra testing. It\u2019s a perfect example of how rigorous science helps us practice better, less alarmist medicine.\nThat\u2019s the future. Using better tools to get rid of the guesswork. Artificial intelligence isn\u2019t just hype here. Researchers are training AI models to read MRIs and predict which fibroids are likely to grow or cause symptoms [10]. Imagine that. Being able to tell a woman not just that she has fibroids, but that these specific ones are the troublemakers we need to watch.\nThe real progress isn\u2019t some single miracle cure. It\u2019s about having more options on the table. It\u2019s about having smarter diagnostics to help choose the right option for the right person. And it\u2019s about finally giving this incredibly common condition the serious, nuanced attention it has always deserved.\nReferences\n[1] Stewart, E. A., Laughlin-Tommaso, S. K., Catherino, W.

      "text": "Ready for a Fresh Start? Your Gut Could Use a Spring Reset, Too\nFeeling sluggish after winter comfort foods? Experts share how to reset your gut this spring with probiotics, nourishing foods, and energizing habits.\n- Share via\nThere\u2019s something undeniably symbolic about spring. It\u2019s a collective exhale. A soft bloom after the freeze. And while you might be thinking about cleaning out your closet or finally tackling your inbox, here\u2019s a quiet reminder: your gut could use a little reset, too.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I sometimes feel as though I\u2019ve hibernated over the winter when I emerge into spring \u2014 sometimes a little foggy and sluggish,\u201d says Dr. Adam Perlman, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Pendulum Therapeutics. \u201cThe heavier, more processed foods common in winter, along with lower fiber intake, can throw off the balance of beneficial bacteria, leading to sluggish digestion, weakened immunity, and decreased energy.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s not wrong. From richer holiday meals to comfort foods during the cold months, winter eating habits often leave the gut microbiome in need of a refresh. As it turns out, spring isn\u2019t just a metaphorical clean slate, it\u2019s also an ideal time to support your digestive health, naturally boost your immunity, and re-energize your body from the inside out.\nSo if your gut feels a little... out of sync lately, you\u2019re not alone. And more importantly? You can absolutely bring it back into balance.\nWhat Winter Does to Your Gut & Why Spring Is the Time to Reset\nWinter tends to bring hearty stews, baked goods, and holiday indulgences. And while delicious, these foods are often low in fiber and high in sugar \u2014 two ingredients that don\u2019t exactly make your gut microbiome thrive.\n\u201cCulturally, the final couple months of the year are dominated by heavier, more processed foods, often with less fiber,\u201d says Dr. Perlman. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of our collective psyche.\u201d\nAnd here\u2019s why that matters: the gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms that help regulate everything from digestion to immune response to mood. A diverse and well-fed microbiome supports efficient digestion, stronger immunity, and better energy. But when you\u2019re not feeding it the right nutrients \u2014 think prebiotic fiber, fermented foods, and plant-based diversity \u2014 it can become imbalanced, leaving you feeling tired, bloated, and more susceptible to illness.\nSpring\u2019s fresh produce, increased sunshine, and longer days offer a natural opportunity to shift back into gut-nourishing habits. Think of it as microbiome maintenance \u2014 just like your seasonal wardrobe swap but for your insides.\nEat the Rainbow: Why Color Is Key to Gut Health\nYou don\u2019t have to be a nutritionist (or an artist) to build a gut-friendly plate. But adding more color is a great place to start.\n\u201cAs we move into spring, it\u2019s important to look for variety on our plates, particularly when it comes to color,\u201d says Dr. Perlman. \u201cLooking for the vivid green of leafy vegetables, the ruby reds of pomegranate or berries, it all supports microbial diversity.\u201d\nWhy color? Because, different plant pigments carry different nutrients and types of prebiotic fiber, which feed various strains of beneficial gut bacteria. Fiber-rich foods like leafy greens, artichokes, asparagus, and low-sugar fruits (hello, berries and bananas) are all excellent for promoting digestion, supporting regularity, and reducing gut inflammation.\nAdd in some whole grains like quinoa, farro, or barley, and you\u2019re giving your gut the raw materials it needs to flourish.\nBest gut-friendly spring foods:\n- Spinach, kale, and arugula\n- Berries, pomegranate, kiwi\n- Bananas (especially slightly green)\n- Lentils, chickpeas, and white beans\n- Oats, barley, and brown rice\nPro tip: Challenge yourself to eat 30 different plant-based foods per week. Research has linked this variety to significantly greater microbiome diversity.\nMeet Akkermansia: The Probiotic Powerhouse Your Gut\u2019s Been Missing\nWe\u2019ve all heard of probiotics, but not all are created equal. Enter Akkermansia muciniphila, a lesser-known but incredibly important probiotic strain. \u201cStudies associate higher levels of Akkermansia with better digestion, immunity, and even weight management,\u201d Dr. Perlman explains.\nWhat makes it so special? Akkermansia muciniphila helps strengthen the gut lining and promote intestinal integrity. Think of it as internal armor, protecting your digestive tract and allowing your body to absorb nutrients better. And unlike other strains, Akkermansia isn\u2019t something you can just pick up in your yogurt. \u201cIt\u2019s not commonly found in food,\u201d Dr. Perlman notes.\nFermented Foods: Real-Time Reinforcements for Your Microbiome\nIf supplements aren\u2019t your thing, good news: there are plenty of delicious, natural ways to introduce healthy bacteria into your system. Fermented foods are one of the simplest and most accessible ways to do that.\nDr. Perlman recommends making spring \u201can ideal time to introduce more fermented foods (like yogurt, sauerkraut, or kombucha) into your diet, as they deliver live, beneficial bacteria directly to your gut.\u201d\nThese probiotic-rich foods help crowd out bad bacteria and repopulate your gut with friendly strains. Plus, they can help with bloating, improve nutrient absorption, and support mood regulation (thanks to the gut-brain connection).\nTry these fermented favorites:\n- Plain Greek yogurt\n- Sauerkraut or kimchi\n- Miso\n- Tempeh\n- Kombucha\n- Kefir\nJust be sure to choose versions with live and active cultures and minimal added sugar.\nLifestyle Habits That Heal (or Hurt) Your Gut\nGut health isn\u2019t just about what you eat. Daily habits, both helpful and harmful, can dramatically shift the state of your microbiome.\nHere are the science-backed changes worth making:\n1. Hydrate Strategically\nWater helps keep things moving, literally. It supports digestion, helps transport nutrients, and maintains the mucosal barrier that protects your gut lining. Aim for at least 8 cups a day, more if you\u2019re active or sweating.\n2. Move More, Sit Less\nExercise promotes a diverse microbiome. Even light physical activity, like walking or yoga, has been shown to positively affect gut bacteria.\n3. Get More (and Better) Sleep\nYour gut and your sleep cycles are closely linked. Poor sleep can increase gut permeability (a.k.a. \u201cleaky gut\u201d) and inflammation. Prioritize 7\u20139 hours a night.\n4. Ditch the Overuse of Antibiotics\nWhile sometimes necessary, frequent antibiotic use can wipe out both harmful and beneficial gut bacteria. Only take them when prescribed, and follow up with probiotics to help replenish your microbiome.\nSpring Forward: A Simple Gut Reset Plan\nFeeling inspired but not sure where to start? Here\u2019s a simple 7-day gut reset plan to help you ease into a new rhythm.\nDay 1\u20132: Add one fermented food to your meals daily.\nDay 3\u20134: Aim for 5 different plant-based foods per day.\nDay 5\u20136: Hydrate with herbal teas and lemon water.\nDay 7: Try one new fiber-rich recipe (like lentil salad or a veggie stir-fry).\nBy the end of the week, you\u2019ll likely notice less bloating, more regularity, and\u2014if you\u2019re lucky\u2014that elusive spring-in-your-step energy.\nGive Your Gut a Fresh Start\nThere\u2019s no such thing as a perfect diet or a flawless microbiome. But spring offers a gentle, natural invitation to reset. Think of it less as a detox and more as a recalibration \u2014 a chance to bring your inner ecosystem back into balance.\n\u201cProactively adjusting your routine during seasonal transitions helps your microbiome adapt,\u201d says Dr. Perlman. \u201cKeeping your gut healthy means your energy stays up, your digestion improves, and your immunity gets stronger.\u201d\nAnd honestly, who doesn\u2019t want that glow-up from the inside out?\nClick here for more information on Pendulum Therapeutics"

      "text": "Understanding Dystonia, the Disorder Causing Involuntary Muscle Contractions\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Dystonia is a neurological disorder causing involuntary muscle contractions and abnormal postures.\n- Botulinum toxin (e.g., Botox) is the gold-standard, first-line treatment for focal dystonias, which affect a single body part.\n- Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a highly effective surgical option for severe or generalized dystonia that doesn\u2019t respond to other treatments.\n- Oral medications like anticholinergics and muscle relaxants are often used to manage symptoms for more widespread dystonia.\n- A comprehensive treatment plan often includes occupational and physical therapy to improve function and manage daily life.\nYou know how frustrating it is when your own muscles won\u2019t cooperate if you have dystonia. This neurological movement disorder is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause repetitive movements or awkward postures. Involuntary muscle movements disrupt normal muscle control. These abnormal muscle movements result in uncontrollable muscle movements making it hard to maintain normal posture or do everyday tasks.\nDystonia symptoms vary but common symptoms of dystonia are muscle spasms, twisting, tremors and abnormal postures. The muscle movements in dystonia are often repetitive and can be painful or disabling. It can be as focused as a writer\u2019s cramp in your hand or as widespread as to affect your entire body, different types of dystonia present in different ways, and is not in common with other disorders such as Restless Legs Syndrome.\nBut here\u2019s the good news: you have more control than you think. Dystonia can affect any part of the body, from neck and face to limbs and trunk. Dystonia affects muscle control and daily functioning, often quality of life. Advances in treatment have changed the game for people with dystonia.\nFrom highly targeted injections to advanced surgical techniques, modern medicine has a powerful arsenal to manage symptoms and get your life back. Let\u2019s break it down.\nTable of Contents\n- Demystifying Dystonia: What\u2019s Happening in the Brain?\n- The Gold Standard: Why Botulinum Toxin is a First-Line Fix\n- Targeting with Technology: Improving Injection Accuracy\n- When Dystonia is More Widespread: The Role of Medication\n- The \u201cBrain Pacemaker\u201d: Deep Brain Stimulation for Severe Cases\n- The Supporting Cast: Why Occupational and Physical Therapy are Crucial\n- What\u2019s Next on the Horizon for Dystonia Treatment?\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nDemystifying Dystonia: What\u2019s Happening in the Brain?\nBefore we get into treatments, let\u2019s understand what\u2019s going on. Think of the basal ganglia as the conductor of a symphony in your brain, responsible for making sure all your movements are smooth and coordinated. In dystonia, the conductor is giving out bad notes and certain muscles are contracting when they shouldn\u2019t.\nThis can happen in one body part (focal dystonia), like the neck (cervical dystonia) or eyelids (blepharospasm). When it affects adjacent areas, it\u2019s called segmental dystonia, and when it\u2019s most of the body, it\u2019s generalized dystonia. Sometimes it\u2019s genetic or no known cause (primary dystonia), and other times it\u2019s from a brain injury, stroke or even a reaction to certain medications (secondary dystonia).\nThe Gold Standard: Why Botulinum Toxin is a First-Line Fix\nWhen you hear \u201cbotulinum toxin,\u201d you probably think of cosmetics, but it\u2019s one of the most powerful therapeutic tools in neurology. For focal dystonias, these injections are the gold standard.\nImagine a light switch for your muscle is stuck in the \u201con\u201d position. A botulinum toxin injection is like a dimmer, turning down the signal that tells the muscle to contract. It works by blocking the release of acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter that tells muscles to move. The injections are targeted directly into the affected muscles to reduce abnormal contractions.\nFor example, in cervical dystonia, the condition affects the neck muscles and a common subtype is spasmodic torticollis which causes involuntary twisting or tilting of the head. If patients develop resistance to type A, botulinum toxin type B is available as an alternative. The result? The overactive muscle relaxes and the involuntary pulling or twisting subsides and you get significant relief from muscle spasms.\nTreatments are needed every 3-4 months to maintain the effect. Clinical guidelines from leading medical organizations strongly support its use especially for conditions like spasmodic dysphonia, a type of dystonia that affects the vocal cords [1]. The benefits are predictable and side effects are usually minimal and temporary [5]. If botulinum toxin doesn\u2019t work, other treatments like oral medications or surgical interventions may be considered.\nTargeting with Technology: Improving Injection Accuracy\nTo make these injections even more effective, doctors often use a technique called electromyography (EMG). Think of it as a GPS for your muscles. By inserting a tiny needle electrode, the doctor can \u201clisten\u201d to the electrical activity in the muscle. This ensures the botulinum toxin is delivered to the exact spot where the overactivity is happening.\nGetting the right muscles is key, as targeting the right muscles means better results. This high-tech approach is more accurate, often allows for a lower dose of medication, reduces side effects and can make the relief last longer [6].\nWhen Dystonia is More Widespread: The Role of Medication\nFor those with generalised dystonia (also spelled generalised dystonia) or segmental dystonia or where injections aren\u2019t enough, oral medications are part of the management plan. These work systemically \u2013 meaning they affect the whole body not just one muscle group.\nThe most common ones are:\n- Anticholinergics (e.g. trihexyphenidyl): These work by blocking acetylcholine throughout the body and are often first line for children and young adults.\n- Benzodiazepines (e.g. clonazepam): These can calm overactive nerve signals and are also good for anxiety that comes with chronic conditions.\n- Baclofen: This muscle relaxant is especially good for generalised dystonia. In severe cases it can be delivered directly to the spinal fluid via a surgically implanted intrathecal pump, sending a concentrated dose right where it\u2019s needed [3] [4]. The baclofen pump delivers medication directly to the spinal cord area to help manage muscle spasticity and dystonia symptoms.\nSystemic treatments are needed for various dystonia subtypes including truncal dystonia, limb dystonia, dopa responsive dystonia, myoclonus dystonia, and rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism.\nResearchers are looking into new options like sodium oxybate and zonisamide to add to this armoury [6].\nThe \u201cBrain Pacemaker\u201d: Deep Brain Stimulation for Severe Cases\nFor dystonia that doesn\u2019t respond to medications or injections, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been a miracle. It\u2019s a surgical option that sounds like science fiction but is now a standard of care for treatment-resistant dystonia. This surgical treatment is considered when all other therapies have failed to help. The goal of DBS is to treat dystonia by reducing muscle contractions and improving quality of life.\nHere\u2019s how it works: a surgeon implants very thin wires, or electrodes, into the globus pallidus internus\u2014a part of the basal ganglia that\u2019s overactive in dystonia. These electrodes are connected to a small, battery-operated device, like a heart pacemaker, that\u2019s implanted under the skin of the chest.t.\nThis device sends gentle electrical pulses to the brain, interrupting the abnormal signals that cause the dystonic movements. For a deeper dive into how this technology works, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke provides excellent patient-focused resources.\nOne of the biggest advantages of DBS is that it is both reversible and adjustable [3]. A neurologist can fine-tune the stimulation externally to achieve the best possible symptom control. It has proven to be a life-altering therapy, especially for those with severe generalized dystonia. However, while DBS can significantly improve symptoms, it does not cure dystonia.\nThe Supporting Cast: Why Occupational and Physical Therapy are Crucial\nTreatments are important but only part of the picture. Rehabilitative therapy is what helps you turn reduced symptoms into daily function. According to the guidelines, specialized occupational and physical therapists can help you learn to manage your body in new ways [2]. These are especially helpful for dystonia patients as they address the unique challenges of the condition.\nTherapy focuses on:\n- Posture: Learning to position your body to reduce strain and prevent your joints from being held in extreme positions.\n- Functional Movement: Gradually reintroducing activities so you can use your affected limbs without fatigue or worsening symptoms.\n- Pain and Stiffness Management: Using techniques like targeted stretching, relaxation exercises (because muscles tense involuntarily in dystonia) and adaptive equipment to manage discomfort and prevent contractures (permanent shortening of a muscle).\nWhat\u2019s Next for Dystonia Treatment?\nThe future is looking bright. Researchers are working on longer-acting botulinum toxin formulas so you\u2019ll need fewer injections a year [6]. As we learn more about the genetic roots of some dystonias, we\u2019re getting closer to personalized, gene-targeted treatments.\nAnd non-invasive techniques that stimulate the brain from the outside, like TMS, are being explored to control symptoms without surgery. To stay up to date on the latest clinical trials and research check out PubMed.\nClosing Thoughts\nLiving with dystonia is tough but it\u2019s a condition you can manage. From the precision of botulinum toxin injections to the magic of deep brain stimulation, the treatments are real and measurable.\nWork with a multidisciplinary team that includes a neurologist, therapists and maybe a surgeon and you can build a personalized plan to quiet the unwanted muscle signals and get your body back in harmony.\nReferences\n[1] Stachler, R.

      "text": "Joint Recovery: Mind and Body Preparation for Orthopedic Surgery with Dr. Jason Snibbe\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Patients with a positive mindset before surgery often experience better outcomes.\n- Visualization can help reduce anxiety and improve recovery readiness.\n- Meditation and breathing techniques calm the nervous system pre-op.\n- Personal goals give purpose and motivation during the recovery process.\n- Social support significantly improves emotional and physical healing.\nSurgery is more than a physical process\u2014it\u2019s a mental game too. Joints are the connections between bones that support and enable movement in the body, so they\u2019re essential for daily living. While surgeons focus on technical precision in the OR, patients who show up mentally prepared recover faster and better.\nDr. Jason Snibbe, a board certified orthopedic surgeon with years of experience in joint replacements, says mindset plays a big role in surgical recovery. \u201cThe best outcomes I see are from patients who walk in and say, \u2018I\u2019ve got this. I\u2019m ready,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cMindset matters.\u201d The goal of surgery and recovery is to restore or improve joint health.\nThis article will explore the importance of mental preparation, emotional support and goal setting for orthopedic surgery patients.\nTable of Contents\n- Why Mindset Matters\n- Tools for Mental Readiness and Physical Therapy\n- Setting Meaningful Goals\n- Support Systems and Supportive Aids\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nWhy Mindset Matters\nIt\u2019s easy to focus on the physical side of surgery\u2014pre-op testing, physical exam, physical therapy, medication. But ignoring the mental aspect can leave patients feeling overwhelmed or unprepared for recovery. According to Dr. Snibbe, those who prepare their minds for the journey ahead tend to feel more in control, less anxious and more resilient when faced with setbacks.\nSurgery can be stressful. Fear of pain, concerns about anesthesia and anxiety about the outcome are all normal. One of the main goals of surgery and recovery is to relieve pain and restore function. But studies show that patients who do preoperative mental preparation\u2014through education, mindfulness or visualization\u2014report lower stress and higher satisfaction after surgery.\nTools for Mental Readiness and Physical Therapy\nVisualization Techniques\nDr. Snibbe recommends patients practice visualization in the days leading up to their surgery. \u201cClose your eyes and imagine the whole process,\u201d he says. \u201cPicture greeting the surgical team, walking into the OR, waking up and taking your first steps post-op. Visualize everything going smoothly.\u201d\nThis technique used by elite athletes and performers can help reduce performance anxiety and feel in control. It turns the unknown into a rehearsed event.\nGuided Meditation and Breathing to Reduce Joint Pain\nMeditation and breathing exercises can reduce preoperative anxiety. Simple daily practices\u2014like mindful breathing, progressive muscle relaxation or guided audio meditations\u2014calm the nervous system. Apps like Headspace and Calm have beginner-friendly routines for pre-surgical stress.\nSetting Meaningful Goals\nAnother key to mental readiness is anchoring the recovery journey with a motivating goal. Dr. Snibbe recommends patients set clear, personal post-op goals. \u201cMaybe you want to hike the Grand Canyon in three months or take a trip to Italy,\u201d he says. \u201cA clear post-op goal keeps you motivated and grounded.\u201d Common post-op goals include improving range of motion, regaining strength and increasing mobility.\nHaving a goal gives recovery a sense of purpose. It\u2019s more than just getting back to baseline\u2014it\u2019s a step towards something meaningful. Many patients also set goals to reduce joint pain and regain function as part of their recovery journey. Whether it\u2019s being able to play with grandkids or get back to a favorite sport, the vision of life after recovery fuels determination during rehab.\nSupport Systems and Supportive Aids\nRecovering from joint surgery isn\u2019t something you should do alone\u2014nor should you have to. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a friend, family member or neighbor, having someone around during recovery\u2014especially during the first six weeks\u2014can make a huge difference,\u201d says Dr. Snibbe.\nThis support can come in many forms. Help with errands, preparing meals or managing medications is important but emotional support matters just as much. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about cooking or errands,\u201d Dr. Snibbe emphasizes. \u201cEmotional connection is healing. Your favorite coffee, a quick chat\u2014it all adds up.\u201d\nClosing Thoughts\nReal recovery from orthopedic surgery is a combination of physical treatment and mental toughness. While physical therapy, guided by a physical therapist who creates a personalized recovery plan and ensures safe progression, rebuilds strength and mobility, mental preparation sets the stage for emotional resilience and motivation. Dr. Snibbe\u2019s approach reminds us that surgery doesn\u2019t happen to a body\u2014it happens to a whole person.\nBy visualizing success, managing stress, setting meaningful goals and leaning on loved ones, patients can walk into the OR feeling in control\u2014and walk out on a faster, easier road to recovery. Combining these mental and physical tools leads to better pain relief and overall recovery outcomes.\nLearn More from Dr. Jason Snibbe\nTo explore Dr. Jason Snibbe\u2019s approach to orthopedic surgery, innovative techniques, and patient-centered care, visit drjasonsnibbe.com or follow him on Instagram @drjasonsnibbe for expert insights and updates."

      "text": "Meningitis: A Guide to the Different Types, Symptoms & Treatments\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.\n- It has three main causes: bacterial, viral, and fungal, each requiring a different treatment approach.\n- Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency that can be fatal if not treated quickly with antibiotics.\n- Viral meningitis is more common and usually less severe, often resolving on its own.\n- Key symptoms include fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, and confusion. Vaccination is the best form of prevention.\nWhen you hear the word \u201cmeningitis,\u201d your mind might jump to a scary, life-threatening brain infection. While that\u2019s partially true for some types, the reality is more nuanced. Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the delicate membranes that act like a protective wrapper around your brain and spinal cord (these meninges are also known as protective membranes).\nThe cause of that inflammation is what truly matters, as it dictates everything from the severity of the illness to the urgency of treatment. Infectious diseases\u2014such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites\u2014can cause meningitis, as can non infectious causes like autoimmune conditions or certain medications. These different agents can cause meningitis by triggering inflammation of the protective membranes. The treatment and outcome of meningitis depends on the underlying cause. Think of it less as a single disease and more as a category of conditions. Let\u2019s break down the different types\u2014bacterial, viral, and fungal\u2014to understand what they are, how they\u2019re treated, and how you can protect yourself.\nTable of Contents\n- What Is Meningitis, Really?\n- Bacterial Meningitis: A True Medical Emergency\n- Viral Meningitis: The More Common, Milder Culprit\n- Fungal Meningitis: A Rare but Serious Threat\n- How Doctors Diagnose Meningitis\n- Prevention: Your Best Defense\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nWhat Is Meningitis, Really?\nImagine your brain and spinal cord are the most important VIPs at a party. The meninges are their security detail\u2014three layers of protective tissue. When these layers become inflamed or swollen, usually due to an infection, it\u2019s called meningitis. This swelling can interfere with the central nervous system\u2019s normal functions, leading to the condition\u2019s hallmark symptoms: a pounding headache, fever, and a stiff neck [4]. Other symptoms, such as altered mental status (confusion or changes in consciousness), can also occur. This is different than from others like Brain Swelling.\nWhile these symptoms are classic, they don\u2019t always appear together, and some people\u2014especially infants and those with weakened immune systems\u2014may show different signs, like irritability, sleepiness, or a lack of appetite. In infants, poor feeding and a bulging fontanelle (baby\u2019s head) can be important signs. Symptoms can also differ between children and adults.\nBacterial Meningitis: A True Medical Emergency\nAcute bacterial meningitis is the type of meningitis that warrants its serious reputation due to its rapid progression and severity. When a bacterial infection invades the bloodstream and travels to the brain and spinal cord, bacteria such as group b streptococcus, listeria monocytogenes, and listeria bacteria can cause severe inflammation, quickly causing meningitis.\nCertain populations, such as pregnant women and those with increased risk due to occupational exposure (for example, those working with animals), are more susceptible to listeria infection. The global disease burden of bacterial meningitis cases is significant, with high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide.\nWithout immediate antibiotic treatment, acute bacterial meningitis can lead to serious complications, including low blood pressure as an early complication, permanent disabilities like brain damage, hearing loss, or even death within hours. Because of this, the condition must be treated quickly.\nBecause of this, doctors don\u2019t wait for a definitive diagnosis if they suspect bacterial meningitis. They begin antibiotic treatment immediately with powerful, broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics, typically a combination including ceftriaxone and vancomycin [1]. The goal is to attack the bacteria right away, even before lab tests identify the specific culprit.\nIn some cases, especially with suspected pneumococcal meningitis, doctors may also administer a corticosteroid called dexamethasone just before or with the first dose of antibiotics. This can help reduce the inflammatory response, potentially lowering the risk of severe neurological complications [4]. To identify bacteria causing meningitis, doctors perform specific tests on cerebrospinal fluid or blood samples. Once the specific bacterium is identified from a spinal fluid culture, the antibiotic regimen may be adjusted for more targeted treatment, which usually lasts for one to two weeks.\nViral Meningitis: The More Common, Milder Culprit\nViral meningitis is far more common and usually much less severe than its bacterial counterpart. Viral meningitis typically has a mild, self-limiting course and often resolves without specific treatment, unlike bacterial meningitis, which can be life-threatening and requires prompt antibiotic therapy. Many different viruses can cause it, including the same ones responsible for mumps, measles, and even the flu.\nIt is important to distinguish between bacterial and viral meningitis, as they differ in severity, treatment, and outcomes. Bacterial meningitis often leads to more serious complications and requires immediate medical intervention, while viral meningitis typically results in a benign outcome with supportive care.\nFor most people with a healthy immune system, viral meningitis is a self-limiting illness, meaning it typically resolves on its own without specific medical treatment. The body\u2019s immune system is usually capable of fighting off the viral invader. Management focuses on supportive care:\n- Rest: Giving your body the energy it needs to recover.\n- Hydration: Replenishing fluids lost from fever.\n- Pain Medication: Managing the intense headache that often accompanies it.\nThe main exception is when meningitis is caused by viruses like herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella-zoster virus (VZV). In these cases, doctors will prescribe antiviral medication, such as acyclovir, to fight the infection directly [2].\nFungal Meningitis: A Rare but Serious Threat\nFungal meningitis is the least common of the three types and typically occurs in people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or who have had an organ transplant. Cryptococcal meningitis is a common form of fungal meningitis, especially in individuals with HIV/AIDS, and is a serious opportunistic infection. It is caused by inhaling fungal spores from the environment [6].\nUnlike the acute onset of bacterial meningitis, the fungal form tends to develop more slowly and can present as chronic meningitis, with symptoms lasting more than four weeks. However, it is a serious condition that requires a long and intensive course of treatment with high-dose antifungal medications, starting with an IV drug like amphotericin B, followed by oral medications like fluconazole. This treatment can last for weeks or even months [3].\nHow Doctors Diagnose Meningitis\nDoctors assess symptoms of meningitis\u2014such as fever, headache, neck stiffness, and neurological changes\u2014alongside test results to guide diagnosis.\nSo, if the symptoms can overlap, how do doctors tell the difference? The definitive diagnostic tool is a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. While it may sound intimidating, this procedure is essential. A doctor carefully inserts a thin needle into the lower back to collect a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\u2014the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.\nAnalyzing the CSF is the key to unlocking the diagnosis. Lab technicians look for:\n- White Blood Cells: An elevated count indicates an infection.\n- Protein and Glucose Levels: Bacterial infections often cause high protein and low glucose levels, while viral infections have a different signature.\n- Pathogen Identification: Using techniques like gram stains, cultures, or a rapid test called polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the lab can identify the specific bacteria or virus responsible for meningitis caused by these agents [5].\n- Aseptic Meningitis: If no bacteria are found in the CSF, but symptoms of meningitis are present, the diagnosis may be aseptic meningitis, which is most often caused by viruses.\nBlood cultures and neuroimaging, like a CT or MRI scan, may also be used to gather more information and rule out other conditions [4]. While diagnostic tests are crucial, a doctor\u2019s clinical judgment is paramount, as lab results alone may not always provide a clear-cut answer [5].\nPrevention: Your Best Defense\nWhen it comes to the most dangerous forms of meningitis, prevention is far better than a cure. Strategies to prevent meningitis include vaccination, practicing good hygiene, and avoiding the sharing of utensils or drinks to reduce transmission. The most effective preventive measure is vaccination. The development of vaccines against the most common culprits of bacterial meningitis has been a major public health victory. Key vaccines recommended by the CDC include:\n- Meningitis vaccine: Recommended for certain at-risk groups to prevent various types of meningitis.\n- Meningococcal vaccine (meningococcal conjugate vaccines): Protect against Neisseria meningitidis and help prevent meningococcal disease, which can cause outbreaks, especially in the African meningitis belt.\n- Pneumococcal vaccines (PCV13, PPSV23): Protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of pneumococcal disease and severe bacterial meningitis.\n- Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine: Protects against the Hib bacteria.\nThese vaccines are part of the routine childhood immunization schedule but are also recommended for adolescents, young adults (especially those in group settings like college dorms or military barracks, who have a higher risk of meningitis), and other at-risk adults [7]. Vaccination strategies may vary depending on the types of meningitis and individual risk factors. Targeted vaccination campaigns are especially important in regions with high risk, such as the African meningitis belt, to control epidemics of meningococcal disease. You can find detailed information on meningitis and vaccination from leading health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO).\nClosing Thoughts\nUnderstanding the different faces of meningitis is key to knowing how to react. While viral meningitis often just requires rest and patience, bacterial meningitis is a race against time where every second counts. Never hesitate to seek immediate medical attention for the \u201cclassic trio\u201d of severe headache, fever, and neck stiffness. Staying up-to-date on vaccinations for yourself and your family is the single most powerful step you can take to prevent this devastating disease. For more in-depth clinical information, resources like PubMed offer access to the latest research and guidelines.\nReferences\n[1] van de Beek, D., Cabellos, C., Dzupova, O., Esposito, S., Klein, M., Kloek, A.

      "text": "CRISPR and Cancer: How Gene Editing Is Revolutionizing Oncology\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- CRISPR is a gene-editing tool that acts like \u201cmolecular scissors,\u201d but using it on cancer is complex.\n- The technology\u2019s biggest impact so far is in research labs, helping scientists understand how cancer works faster than ever before.\n- A key clinical use is improving CAR-T immunotherapy by making immune cells more powerful and resilient in a lab before they are given to a patient.\n- Major hurdles like delivering CRISPR to the right cells and avoiding \u201coff-target\u201d DNA damage prevent its use as a simple \u201ccure.\u201d\n- Its application is being tested for tough cases, like specific gynecological cancers and tumors that resist other drugs.\nTable of Contents\nEvery so often, a tool comes along that feels like science fiction. CRISPR is one of them. It\u2019s a pair of molecular scissors that we can program to find one specific spot in three billion letters of DNA and make a cut [2]. Incredible. The hype machine went into overdrive. We were going to edit out diseases. Cure cancer. The end.\nHere\u2019s the problem with that fantasy. Cancer isn\u2019t a clean typo. It\u2019s a riot. It\u2019s a chaotic, messy, ever-changing system that thrives on mistakes. It rewrites its own rulebook as it goes. So you have this exquisitely precise scalpel, and you\u2019re trying to use it in the middle of a cellular brawl [7]. It\u2019s a mismatch. A big one.\nThis isn\u2019t me being cynical. It\u2019s just recognizing where the real work is. And right now, the most revolutionary thing CRISPR is doing for cancer has nothing to do with curing patients directly. It\u2019s happening in the lab [1]. For years, if we wanted to know what a specific gene did, we had to go through a long, painful process to shut it down. Now? A researcher can just use CRISPR to snip that gene out of a cancer cell in a petri dish and see what happens [4]. Does the cell die? Stop growing? Suddenly become vulnerable to an old drug? We can get answers in weeks, not years. We\u2019re building a proper instruction manual for our enemy, and we\u2019re doing it at a shocking speed [5]. That\u2019s the real revolution so far. It\u2019s a research tool. And it\u2019s the best one we\u2019ve ever had.\nUpgrading the Soldiers\nSo if we can\u2019t just march into the body and \u201cedit\u201d the tumor away, what\u2019s the next best thing? You take the fight somewhere else. Somewhere you can control. That\u2019s the whole idea behind CAR-T cell therapy. We take a patient\u2019s own immune cells\u2014their T-cells\u2014out of their body and into the lab. We engineer them to recognize cancer. Then we put them back. It can work miracles. It can also fizzle out. The T-cells get tired. The cancer learns to hide.\nThis is where CRISPR gets its first real clinical shot. In the lab, before we put those T-cells back, we can give them a CRISPR tune-up. A few quick snips. We can edit out the gene that tells a T-cell to stand down, making it relentless at it\u2019s goal. We can snip out its natural receptors so it doesn\u2019t get confused and attack the wrong thing [3]. Better weapons. Stronger armor. A clearer target [10]. We\u2019re not fixing the patient. We\u2019re upgrading their soldiers in the workshop before sending them to the front lines. This is where the action is right now, especially for nasty, hard-to-treat cancers, like in gynecological oncology or tumors that have stopped responding to anything else [6] [7]. It\u2019s practical. It\u2019s contained. And it\u2019s already happening.\nThe Ground War\nBut the sci-fi dream of injecting a cure dies hard. Why can\u2019t we just do that? It comes down to boring, practical problems. The kinds of problems that kill big ideas. Delivery and safety [3] [9]. First, how do you get the CRISPR machinery into every last cancer cell, deep inside a person\u2019s body, without also hitting a bunch of healthy cells by mistake? Our delivery systems just aren\u2019t that good yet. It\u2019s like trying to mail a million letters and making sure every single one gets to the right house during an active hurricane.\nThen there\u2019s the \u201coops\u201d factor. Off-target effects. What if the scissors cut the wrong gene [8]? In the best case, nothing happens. In the worst case, you create a whole new problem. You could, in theory, cause a new cancer while trying to cure the old one. The risk is small. It\u2019s getting smaller every year. But it\u2019s not zero. And when you\u2019re talking about rewriting someone\u2019s permanent code, the stakes are as high as they get.\nSo, no. This isn\u2019t a magic wand. The revolution is a slow, grinding one. It\u2019s happening at the bench, letting us understand the disease. It\u2019s happening in the cell processing lab, letting us build better therapies. The idea of a simple cure-in-a-needle remains a distant hope.\nReferences\n[1] Wang, S. W., Gao, C., Zheng, Y. M., Yi, L., Lu, J. C., Huang, X. Y., Cai, J. B., Zhang, P. F., Cui, Y. H., & Ke, A. W.

      "text": "Hydrocephalus: Understanding Surgical Treatments & Recovery\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Hydrocephalus is an excess of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain\u2019s ventricles.\n- Surgery is the first-line and most effective treatment.\n- The two primary surgeries are the Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV).\n- Medications like acetazolamide offer temporary relief but are not a long-term cure.\n- For Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), a diagnostic lumbar puncture helps predict surgical success.\nIt\u2019s called \u201cwater on the brain\u201d but hydrocephalus is so much more. It\u2019s a serious neurological condition caused by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\u2014the clear, protective liquid that cushions your brain and spinal cord. The brain produces CSF primarily in the choroid plexus within the ventricular system and this CSF produced circulates continuously.\nHydrocephalus occurs when there is an abnormal buildup of excess fluid in the brain\u2019s ventricular system which can put pressure on brain tissue and cause brain damage if left untreated. When CSF can\u2019t flow or be absorbed properly it builds up in the brain\u2019s cavities or ventricles. This increases pressure inside the skull which can cause brain injury if left untreated.\nHydrocephalus affects people of all ages and can be classified as congenital hydrocephalus (present at birth), acquired hydrocephalus (develops after birth) or hydrocephalus ex vacuo (due to loss of brain tissue).\nFortunately hydrocephalus is treatable. While the idea of brain surgery can be scary, the medical evidence is clear: surgical intervention is the gold standard for restoring normal CSF flow and giving patients the best chance at a high quality of life.\nTable of Contents\n- A Cerebrospinal Fluid Plumbing Problem in the Brain\n- Why Surgery is the Cornerstone of Care\n- The Two Main Surgical Fixes: Shunts vs. ETV\n- What About Medication? A Temporary, Supporting Role\n- Diagnosing for Success and Monitoring for Life\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nA Cerebrospinal Fluid Plumbing Problem in the Brain\nThink of your brain\u2019s CSF system as a sophisticated plumbing network. CSF is produced, circulated through the ventricles and then absorbed into the bloodstream. The flow of CSF through the ventricular system is essential for brain health as it protects and nourishes the brain. Disruptions in how CSF flows can cause hydrocephalus resulting in increased intracranial pressure and ventriculomegaly. Hydrocephalus occurs when this network breaks down. There are two main reasons for this failure:\n- Obstructive (Non-Communicating) Hydrocephalus: This is a literal blockage. Like a clog in a pipe, something\u2014such as a tumor, congenital narrowing or scar tissue from an infection\u2014is physically preventing CSF from moving along its normal path. Some people develop hydrocephalus due to congenital conditions affecting fetal development such as spina bifida.\n- Communicating Hydrocephalus: The pathways are open but the problem is with absorption. The CSF can\u2019t be absorbed into the bloodstream properly and accumulates. A common form of this is Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) which affects older adults and often presents with a classic triad of symptoms: difficulty walking, cognitive decline (memory problems) and loss of bladder control.\nDismissing these symptoms as a normal part of aging is a common mistake. Recognizing them as signs of a treatable condition is the first step to recovery.\nWhy Surgery is the Cornerstone of Care\nWhen you have a plumbing clog or a drainage issue you need a plumber to fix the underlying problem. The same logic applies to hydrocephalus. The goal of treatment isn\u2019t just to manage the pressure\u2014it\u2019s to restore the normal circulation of CSF. That\u2019s why surgery is the definitive treatment. Hydrocephalus is treated primarily through surgical treatment options such as shunt placement or endoscopic third ventriculostomy. While there is no cure for hydrocephalus it\u2019s a treatable condition and early intervention can make a big difference.\nTrying to manage this condition with medication alone is like using a bucket to catch water from a leaky pipe instead of fixing the pipe itself. Surgical treatment is the main form of hydrocephalus treatment, to treat hydrocephalus by restoring normal CSF flow and preventing further complications. It\u2019s a temporary fix that doesn\u2019t solve the root cause. For lasting relief and to prevent irreversible neurological damage surgery is essential.\nThe Two Main Surgical Fixes: Shunts vs. ETV\nA neurosurgeon will recommend one of two highly effective procedures based on the type of hydrocephalus and the patient\u2019s specific anatomy. The most common treatment for hydrocephalus is the use of a shunt system which requires ongoing monitoring for potential complications.\nAfter these procedures it\u2019s important to note that shunt systems can experience issues such as shunt malfunction, shunt failure or shunt obstruction. Advances like smart shunt systems are being developed to improve patient outcomes and prevent these complications.\nVentriculoperitoneal (VP) Shunt\nThe VP shunt is the most common treatment for hydrocephalus and works for both obstructive and communicating types. It\u2019s a simple and elegant solution: a flexible tube or catheter is placed in one of the brain\u2019s ventricles. This tube is connected to a valve that regulates pressure and is tunneled under the skin to another part of the body\u2014usually the peritoneal cavity (the abdomen)\u2014where the excess CSF can be safely absorbed.\nThink of it as an internal drainage system that reroutes fluid from an area of high pressure to an area where it can be harmlessly managed by the body.\nEndoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV)\nETV is a minimally invasive procedure best suited for obstructive hydrocephalus, particularly when the blockage is in a specific channel called the aqueduct of Sylvius. Instead of placing a shunt, a surgeon uses a tiny camera (an endoscope) to navigate to the floor of the third ventricle. There they create a small hole allowing the trapped CSF to bypass the obstruction and flow freely.\nFor the right patient ETV is a game-changer because it avoids the need for permanent hardware, reducing the risk of long term complications like infection or mechanical failure associated with shunts.\nWhat About Medication? A Temporary, Supporting Role\nWhile surgery is the ultimate solution, medication can play a brief but important supporting role. Medications like acetazolamide (at doses of 250\u20131000 mg/day) and sometimes furosemide can help by reducing the body\u2019s production of CSF [2] [3] [4] [5].\nBut it\u2019s important to understand their limitations. These medications are not a cure. They are typically used in specific situations:\n- Temporarily reducing dangerous intracranial pressure in acutely ill patients.\n- As a bridge to stabilize a patient who is waiting for surgery.\n- In rare cases managing mild or fluctuating symptoms [2] [5].\nRelying on them long term is ineffective and doesn\u2019t address the underlying hydrocephalus.\nDiagnosing for Success and Monitoring for Life\nDiagnosing hydrocephalus involves a combination of neurological evaluation and brain imaging to assess for abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord. Before recommending surgery for NPH, doctors often perform a test to see if it will work. A high-volume lumbar puncture, where 30 to 50 mL of CSF is removed via a spinal tap, can give a preview of what a shunt will do [1]. If a patient\u2019s gait or cognitive function improves even temporarily after the fluid is removed, it\u2019s a strong sign a VP shunt will provide lasting relief.\nWhen diagnosing hydrocephalus MRI is often used, especially if other imaging like CT scans are inconclusive, to get detailed images of the brain. Early diagnosis is key to preventing the serious consequences of untreated hydrocephalus. The physical symptoms and symptoms of hydrocephalus vary by age; for example older children may present differently than infants or adults and recognizing these differences is important for accurate diagnosis and management.\nTreatment doesn\u2019t end with surgery. Because shunts can malfunction, get blocked or infected, regular follow up with a neurosurgery team is essential. This includes monitoring for any return of symptoms and sometimes using imaging like CT or MRI scans to make sure everything is working as it should. This lifelong partnership between patient and clinical team is key to long term success. For more information on diagnosis and treatment the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a great resource. The Hydrocephalus Association is also a valuable resource for patients and families looking for information and support.\nClosing Thoughts\nHydrocephalus is a serious condition but it\u2019s far from a hopeless diagnosis. Modern surgical techniques offer a direct and effective way to manage CSF buildup, prevent further neurological decline and improve a person\u2019s quality of life. If you or a loved one is experiencing unexplained issues with walking, thinking or bladder control don\u2019t dismiss them. A conversation with a doctor and a neurosurgical evaluation could be the first step to getting your health and vitality back.\nThis article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.
