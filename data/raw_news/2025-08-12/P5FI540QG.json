  "description": "A 2016 satellite photo shows nearly a dozen swirling dark spots that emerged in the clouds over Heard Island in the Indian Ocean.",
  "content": "10 unusually dark cloud holes were spotted swirling as they scattered across the skies over Heard Island in 2016.\n\nThis striking satellite photo shows 10 swirling \"dark voids\" that appeared above an uninhabited volcanic island in the Indian Ocean. The black spots are the result of atmospheric cloud vortices, but are oddly pronounced and significantly contorted compared to most other examples of this phenomenon.\n\nThe spinning voids are trailing off Heard Island \u2014 an uninhabited Australian territory in the southern Indian Ocean, around 900 miles (1,500 kilometers) north of Antarctica. The cloud-obscured landmass has a surface area of around 142 square miles (368 square kilometers).\n\nOn average, the dark spots are around 8 miles (13 km) wide, decreasing slightly in size the further they have traveled, according to . They are initially moving away from the island in a northeasterly direction (left to right).\n\nThe spinning holes are the result of a phenomenon known as von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices, which occur when a prevailing wind encounters a landmass, disturbing the airflow and creating \"a double row of vortices which alternate their direction of rotation,\" according to the . They are named for Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, a Hungarian-American physicist, who was the first to describe this natural phenomenon.\n\nIn this case, the vortices are being created by Mawson Peak, a 9,000-foot-tall (2,700 meters) active volcano sat at the heart of Heard Island.\n\nRelated: See all the best images of Earth from space\n\nNormally, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices create long trails of swirling clouds that get caught up in the disrupted air flows. The cloud streams are normally perfectly straight, such as a series of parallel vortex streams that emerged side-by-side off the Atlantic coast of Africa in 2015 (see above).\n\nBut in this case, the vortex stream appears to bend almost 90 degrees midway through the stream. This change in direction was most likely caused by a sporadic burst of the intense westerly winds that frequently blow across the area around Heard Island at speeds over 50 mph (80km/h), known as the \"Furious Fifties,\" according to the Earth Observatory.\n\nIn most examples of von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices, the resulting cloud trails can be quite wispy, tracing out the subtle variations in the invisible air currents, such as examples observed and .\n\nHowever, in this photo, the wispy trails are replaced by a string of concentrated holes, or gaps, within the clouds. This is probably due to exceptionally thick cloud coverage, which can be disrupted only at the heart of each spinning section within the vortex stream.\n\nMawson Peak is smaller than most of the peaks that regularly produce von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices, making it slightly rarer for the cloud swirls to emerge there. However, Heard Island has produced more traditional vortex streams in the past, such as .",

The unusual patterns are the result of changes in temperature caused by gravity waves.\nWhere is it? The Crozet Islands in the Southern Ocean. [-46.41255591, 51.99872352].\nWhat's in the photo? A pair of wave clouds formed by island mountains.\nWho took the photo? An unnamed astronaut on board the International Space Station.\nWhen was it taken? Jan. 8, 2023.\nThis 2023 astronaut photo captures the striking beauty of a pair of perfectly aligned, arrow-shaped wave clouds rippling above the Crozet Islands \u2014 an archipelago of uninhabited French islands in the Southern Ocean, located roughly halfway between South Africa and Antarctica.\nWave clouds are repeating bands of cloud and non-cloud that look like wispy streaks floating in the sky when viewed from above or below. These bands are created when stable air moves over raised land. The topography pushes the air upward before gravity pulls it back down, causing the air to oscillate up and down, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.\nWhen the air rises, it cools down, and water vapor condenses into clouds. But when gravity pulls the air downward, it is compressed by increased atmospheric pressure, which heats it up via a process called adiabatic heating and forces any clouds in the air to evaporate, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nWave clouds are also known as gravity waves. This should not be confused with \"gravitational waves,\" which are ripples in space-time created by extreme cosmic entities such as black holes and colliding galaxies.\nRelated: 12 amazing images of Earth from space\nThe wave cloud on the left of the image is formed by air passing over Mount Marion-Dufresne, a 3,576-foot-tall (1,090 meters) peak on East Island; the pattern on the right is caused by Mascarin Peak, a mountain on Possession Island that stands 3,064 feet (933 m) tall. The two islands are separated by around 10 miles (16 kilometers) of water.\nWave clouds are rare but can be found more often over large bodies of water because the air there is more stable, which makes it more prone to oscillating if it is disturbed, according to NASA.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nSimilar wave clouds were spotted over the Crozet Islands in 2012 and 2014 but did not look as perfectly aligned as the pair in this photo.\nThe Crozet Islands are uninhabited apart from a small research station on Possession Island, from where scientists study the islands' more than 5 million penguins and other marine wildlife, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.\nIn the past, these islands have also temporarily been home to several groups of marooned sailors who survived being shipwrecked by the jagged rocks along the islands' steep cliffs, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. In 1876, half of the 88 passengers and crew onboard the shipwrecked vessel Strathmore survived on Possession Island for seven months before being rescued, according to The New Zealand Herald.\nHarry is a U.K.-based senior staff writer at Live Science.

Klyuchevskoy (Klyuchevskaya Sopka), Russia [56.050698, 160.6463962]\nWhat's in the photo? A giant eruption plume trailing off an erupting volcano\nWhich satellite took the photo? NASA Aqua\nWhen was it taken? Nov. 1, 2023\nThis eerie satellite photo shows a \"devilish\" Russian volcano spewing out a 1,000-mile-long river of smoke into Earth's atmosphere. It is a striking reminder of the volcanic power trapped within the Pacific \"Ring of Fire.\"\nThe volcano, known as Klyuchevskoy (or sometimes Klyuchevskaya Sopka), is an active stratovolcano in Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, which is home to more than 300 volcanoes. Klyuchevskoy's peak stands at 15,597 feet (4,754 meters) above sea level, making it taller than any other volcano in Asia or Europe, according to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program.\nThe satellite image was snapped by NASA's Aqua satellite during a particularly active point of an eruptive phase, which lasted between June 22 and Dec. 31, 2023. The sudden flurry of activity released twin lava flows, shaped like a pair of horns, and a giant plume of smoke, ash and toxic gases that temporarily halted air traffic in the area.\nThe eruption plume reached a maximum height of 7.5 miles (12 km) above Earth's surface and stretched more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) across the Pacific Ocean, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.\nThe satellite snap featured above is a false color image. The lava flows have been enhanced using infrared radiation to help make them visible, while the clouds surrounding the volcano have been given a blueish hue to help distinguish them from the eruption plume.\nRelated: See all the best images of Earth from space\nKlyuchevskoy is one of the most active volcanoes in the Kamchatka Peninsula. It has experienced at least 18 different eruptive phases since the turn of the 21st century and blown its top more than 60 times in the past 100 years, according to the Global Volcanism Program.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe lofty mountain's most recent eruptive phase began in April 2025 and is still ongoing, although volcanic activity had diminished by May.\nKlyuchevskoy is closely flanked by Bezymianny, a smaller volcano standing at around 9,900 feet (3,000 m) tall. The nearby mountain is less active than Klyuchevskoy and was previously assumed to be extinct until an eruption in 1955. It has since erupted multiple times.\nFour other volcanoes \u2014 Ushkovsky, Tolbachik, Zimina and Udina \u2014 are located within a 20-mile (32 km) radius of Klyuchevskoy. All of these mountains, including Klyuchevskoy and Bezymianny, are believed to have formed within the last 10,000 years, which is relatively young for volcanoes.\nThe Kamchatka Peninsula is a hotspot for volcanoes due to its position along the Ring of Fire \u2014 a roughly 25,000-mile-long (40,000 km) arc encircling large parts of the Pacific Ocean basin, where tectonic plates intersect one another. This giant ring, which also runs beneath Indonesia, Japan and Tonga, contains around two-thirds of the world's terrestrial volcanoes and is the site of around 90% of all earthquakes.\nHarry is a U.K.-based senior staff writer at Live Science.

Kumani Bank, Caspian Sea [39.5666672, 49.5898615]\nWhat's in the photos? The emergence and rapid disappearance of a volcanic \"ghost island\"\nWhich satellites took the photos? Landsat 8 and Landsat 9\nWhen were the photos taken? Nov. 18, 2022; Feb. 14, 2023; and Dec. 25, 2024\nA striking series of satellite photos shows the brief lifespan of a \"ghost island\" that emerged and quickly disappeared in the Caspian Sea after an underwater mud volcano blew its top.\nThe fleeting landmass emerged at the end of January 2023 above Kumani Bank, an underwater volcano about 15 miles (24 kilometers) off the east coast of Azerbaijan. By the time it was fully formed, on Feb. 4, the island measured around 1,300 feet (400 meters) across, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.\nHowever, the island was unstable, and by the time the last photo was taken in December 2024, it had \"nearly eroded away, retreating from view like an apparition,\" Earth Observatory representatives wrote. By now, the island has likely vanished.\nKumani Bank has erupted eight times since it was first discovered in 1861. Each outburst lasted just a few days, yet all of these events resulted in at least some form of temporary island. The strongest recorded eruption, which occurred in 1950, resulted in a 2,300-foot-wide (700 m) landmass that stood 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\nRelated: See all the best images of Earth from space\nKumani Bank is a mud volcano, meaning it spews a superheated slurry of mud and water instead of lava and ash.\nAzerbaijan has one of the highest concentrations of mud volcanoes anywhere on Earth, with more than 300 muddy vents on the mainland or offshore. This is due to the country's position above a \"convergence zone\" where the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide, leading to increased geothermal activity.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nMud volcanoes are not as violent or destructive as other volcanoes. However, they do contain high levels of pressurized natural gas. This gas can be ignited by sparks from colliding rocks, leading to sporadic fiery outbursts.\nAn underwater mud volcano near Kumani Bank is believed to have triggered a towering inferno, several hundred feet tall, that exploded above the Caspian Sea in 2021.\nOther volcanic \"ghosts\"\nNormal, non-mud volcanoes can also create temporary islands when they erupt beneath the waves.\nIn 2015, a 0.7-square-mile (1.9 square kilometers) island emerged in the southern Pacific Ocean above the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano in Tonga. However, it was wiped out by the same volcano in January 2022, when the underwater mountain unleashed one of the most powerful volcanic eruptions ever recorded.\nResearchers later revealed that the colossal explosion likely killed never-before-seen microbe species that evolved on the isolated landmass.\nIn October 2023, a violent eruption off the coast of Japan's Iwo Jima island also created a temporary landmass, dubbed Niijima, or \"New Island.\" It grew to be around 330 feet (100 m) wide and 66 feet (20 m) tall, and was clearly visible from space.\nBut in March 2024, drone footage revealed that the island had started to quickly sink into the sea, despite continued signs of volcanic activity, according to Newsweek.\nHarry is a U.K.-based senior staff writer at Live Science.

One of these peaks was the site of a surprise eruption that temporarily cooled the Northern Hemisphere in 1831.\nWhere is it? Simushir, Kuril Islands [46.9590781, 152.0396667]\nWhat's in the photo? The lofty peaks of four volcanoes standing side-by-side\nWhich satellite took the photo? Landsat 8\nWhen was it taken? Sept. 12, 2024\nThis eye-catching satellite photo shows Simushir, a little-known Russian island and former Soviet naval base, featuring four end-to-end volcanoes that are evenly spaced and in a surprisingly straight line. One of the four peaks was the site of one of the largest eruptions in recorded history, which significantly altered Earth's climate around 200 years ago.\nSimushir is one of the Kuril Islands \u2014 a Russian-controlled archipelago of more than 50 volcanic islands in the North Pacific Ocean. Like the rest of the Kuril Islands, the sovereignty of Simushir has been passed back and forth between two nearby countries, Russia and Japan, several times over the last 400 years. It was most recently used as a secret Soviet nuclear submarine base until 1994, but is now uninhabited.\nThe 5-mile-long (8 kilometer) landmass is home to four major volcanoes that can be seen from space. These towering structures are, from southeast to northwest (left to right): Milna, Zavaritski, Prevo and Uratman.\nMilna is the tallest of the four at 5,050 feet (1,540 meters) tall and last erupted in 1914. Next to it lies Zavaritzki, also known as Zavaritskogo, which stands around 2,047 feet (624 m) above sea level, and last blew its top in 1957, leaving behind a largely hollowed-out crater.\nPrevo, which is 4,460 feet (1,360 m) tall, last erupted in 1825. Meanwhile Uratman, which stands at 2,224 feet (678 m), shows no signs of having erupted for at least 12,000 years. A deep lagoon, known as Brouton Bay, can also be seen surrounding Uratman. This was where the Soviets stored some of their nuclear submarines.\nRelated: See all the best images of Earth from space\nThere's a smaller fifth volcano on the island, named Goriaschaia Sopka, which is located on the northeast flank of Milna, but it\u2019s indiscernible from the larger volcanoes in satellite photos. Despite being classed as individual volcanoes, Goriaschaia Sopka and Milna are closely linked to one another.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nSimushir and the other Kuril Islands are hotspots for volcanic activity because they're located within what experts call the \"Ring of Fire\" \u2014 a 25,000-mile-long (40,000 km) arc located above tectonic plate boundaries surrounding the outer edge of the Pacific Ocean, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

The giant swirls are collectively one of the best examples of this meteorological phenomenon ever seen.\nWhere is it? Atlantic Ocean\nWhat's in the photo? Streams of von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices flowing off multiple islands\nWhich satellite took the photo? NASA's Terra satellite\nWhen was it taken? May 20, 2015\nThis striking satellite photo shows multiple examples of a rare meteorological phenomenon, known as \"von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices,\" swirling off at least six different islands in the Atlantic Ocean. Very rarely have so many of these swirling cloud trails been seen at once and over such a large area.\nVon K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices occur when a prevailing wind encounters a landmass, disturbing the airflow and creating \"a double row of vortices which alternate their direction of rotation,\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These vortices then propagate downstream of the landmass and become visible when clouds get caught up in them.\nIn this photo, giant cloud swirls collectively cover an area of around 260,000 square miles (670,000 square km), making this one of the most widespread examples of concurrent vortices ever seen, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.\nThe most intricate swirls in the photo are seen in the vortices off Madeira, a Portuguese archipelago, at the top of the image (see below). Here, the high concentration of clouds reveals the detailed movements of the disturbed air in exceptional detail.\nRelated: See all the best images of Earth from space\nLess-defined swirling trails are also seen trailing off the Spanish Canary Islands. From left to right, these are: La Palma, El Hierro, La Gomera, Tenerife and Gran Canaria. If you look closely (see below), you can see that the vortices from La Gomera and Tenerife interfere with each other, almost canceling them out completely.\nMadeira and the Canary Islands are among the best places on Earth to see von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices, according to the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). This is because they have high peaks, high temperatures and are reasonably separated from their respective continents.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThese swirls are also commonly spotted coming from Guadalupe, a group of six French-owned islands in the Caribbean, on the opposite side of the Atlantic. On rare occasions, the swirls have also coincided with other phenomena, such as a warped \"double rainbow.\"\nWhile the vortices mostly occur in tropical climates, they can also be seen in the Arctic, such as on Svalbard's Bear Island, where they can sometimes appear alongside swirling algal blooms.\nOn average, a pair of von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices is created somewhere on Earth every eight hours, according to EUMESTAT.\nHarry is a U.K.-based senior staff writer at Live Science.

      "text": "Giant, near-perfect cloud ring appears in the middle of the Pacific Ocean \u2014 Earth from space\nA 2014 satellite image captured a rare glimpse of a massive, eerily circular ring of clouds that formed slap-bang in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\nWhere is it? In the middle of the Pacific Ocean\nWhat's in the photo? A circular, open-celled cloud above the ocean surface\nWhich satellite took the photo? NASA's Terra satellite\nWhen was it taken? Sept. 3, 2014\nThis striking satellite image reveals a giant, near-perfect cloud circle that formed in the heart of the Pacific Ocean more than a decade ago. While this type of cloud is not uncommon, it is extremely rare to find one isolated and in the middle of nowhere, experts say.\nThe strange structure, which is approximately 280 miles (450 kilometers) wide, was spotted \"a few thousand kilometers southwest of the Hawaiian Islands\" by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.\nThe fluffy ring is made up of cumulus clouds that have been sculpted into a Rayleigh-Benard convection cell \u2014 a meteorological phenomenon powered by the rising and falling of air that's been warmed or cooled to different temperatures, known as convection.\nThere are two types of cloud cells: closed cells, which occur when cold air sinks around the cells' border, causing clouds to form at their centers; and open cells, which occur when cold air sinks at the cells' center, triggering clouds to form around their borders, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The cloud ring in the satellite photo was formed by a closed cell.\nCloud cells are normally hexagonal and usually appear alongside other cells of the same type, creating noticeable patterns in the sky. Open-cell clouds often form wispy honeycomb-like lattices, but for some reason, this cell appears to be all on its own.\nRelated: See all the best images of Earth from space\nThe lone cloud ring was likely triggered by a parcel of warm air over a small island or patch of water that was superheated by the sun, according to the Earth Observatory.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\"As the warm air became buoyant and rose, cumulus clouds and eventually patches of light rain probably developed. The rain would have cooled the air beneath the clouds, causing a downdraft that sent rain-cooled air outward from the original location of the clouds,\" Earth Observatory representatives wrote. \"When the rain-cooled air encountered warmer air at the edge of the cell, it likely pushed the warm air up, which caused the ring of cumulus clouds to form.\"\nThe cloud cell was located just south of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ICZ) \u2014 a low-pressure belt near the equator where the trade winds trigger frequent thunderstorms and heavy rainfall. This may have also played a role in the cloud's creation, according to the Earth Observatory.\nThe ocean surface to the east (right) of the cloud ring appears to have a metallic shine. This is the result of a sunglint, where sunlight bounces off the sea and directly back to an observing instrument in space. This can transform large patches of the ocean into swirling silver mirrors.\nCloud cells were only discovered in 1961, thanks to images from NASA's Television Infrared Observation Satellite 1 (TIROS-1) satellite \u2014 the first full-scale weather satellite ever launched into space. Before then, the intricate patterns of the cells had gone largely unnoticed by meteorologists, according to the Earth Observatory.\nHarry is a U.K.-based senior staff writer at Live Science.

      "text": "Earth from space: Mysterious, slow-spinning cloud 'cyclone' hugs the Iberian coast\nThis 2017 satellite photo shows an unusual cloud \"cyclone\" nestled up against the coastline of Spain and Portugal. Researchers are unsure what caused the strange structure's spin, but ocean eddies and an extreme heat wave likely played key roles.\nWhere is it? The west coast of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal).\nWhat's in the photo? A spiraling cloud front hugging the coastline.\nWhat took the photo? NASA's Terra satellite.\nWhen was it taken? July 16, 2017.\nThis striking photo shows an unusual cloud spiral nestled perfectly along the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula in 2017.\nThe spiral consists of moist, cloudy air from the sea that's been swirled together with clear, dry air from the land by a phenomenon known as cyclonic rotation \u2014 the same mechanism that is responsible for generating tropical storms such as hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.\nHowever, in this case, the rotation was much slower and weaker than the rotation during tropical storms, so the cloudy and dry air did not fully mix together, which prevented a proper vortex from forming. This also stopped any clouds from passing over the land. (The image has been edited slightly to include more infrared light, in order to accentuate the difference between the land and cloud.)\n\"Precisely what caused this [unusual] mid-latitude rotation remains somewhat of a mystery,\" Stephen Jospeh Munchak, a meteorologist at NASA's Mesoscale Atmospheric Processes Laboratory told NASA's Earth Observatory. However, it could have been caused by an eddy \u2014 a temporary, swirling current of water that extends deep below the ocean's surface, he added.\nAn extreme heat wave that swept across Southern Europe in July 2017 also created an usually large temperature difference between the cloudy, sea air and the dry, land air. This may have further prevented the two fronts from mixing, helping to create the stunning spiral shape. When this photo was taken, temperatures in Spain and Portugal were above 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), according to NASA's Earth Observatory.\nRelated: 12 amazing images of Earth from space\nThe clouds in the spiral are marine stratocumulus clouds \u2014 common low-lying clouds that usually stay below 6,000 feet (1,830 meters) and can cover up to 6.5% of Earth's surface at any one time, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nInterestingly, marine stratocumulus clouds normally only appear along the western coasts of Earth's landmasses, according to NOAA. This is because they form when cold water from the deep sea is brought to the surface by Earth's spin \u2014 also known as the Coriolis effect \u2014 which cools the air above and enables water vapor to condense into clouds. Along eastern coastlines, the Coriolis effect does not push cold water toward the coast, which means it does not rise toward the surface.\nThe rotating clouds in the image stretched for hundreds of miles and likely persisted for several days. However, it is unlikely that they released any precipitation, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.\nSimilar cloud cyclones have appeared off the Iberian coast and the western coast of Morocco in the past but they are not normally as defined as the spiral in this photo, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.\nHarry is a U.K.-based senior staff writer at Live Science.

Bear Island, Svalbard [74.43137835, 19.058443166]\nWhat's in the photo? Atmospheric vortices in the clouds and a swirling algal bloom in the ocean\nWhich satellite took the photo? NASA Aqua\nWhen was it taken? July 13, 2023\nThis striking satellite shot shows a pair of simultaneous phenomena painting parallel swirls in the sea and sky surrounding Bear Island. The isolated land mass, also known as Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya, is located in Norway's Svalbard archipelago and is surrounded by highly radioactive waters that may endanger local wildlife \u2014 which, ironically, does not include many bears.\nIn the upper left corner of the image, a gap in the clouds is trailed by a series of interlinked cloud swirls that appear to have been platted together like a pretzel. These swirls, known as von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices, are formed when clouds get caught up in an airflow that has been disrupted by a tall landmass, most often above an ocean, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.\nIn this case, the vortices are created by clouds passing over Miseryfjellet, the largest mountain on Bear Island. Miseryfjellet, which translates to \"misery mountain,\" has three peaks: Urd, Verdande and Skuld, named after a trio of deities from Norse mythology, known as the Norns. The tallest peak, Skuld, stands around 1,759 feet (536 meters) above sea level.\nIn the center of the image, a gigantic bloom of photosynthetic algae, or phytoplankton, can be seen swirling near the surface of the Barents Sea. The light green hues of the algal artwork are the result of chlorophyll \u2014 the pigment in algae and plants that allows them to convert sunlight into energy, via photosynthesis. The spiraling shapes of the bloom, which spans up to 250 miles (400 kilometers) across, are the result of ocean currents.\nRelated: See all the best images of Earth from space\nThe simultaneous appearance of von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices and the algal bloom is a complete coincidence and the two phenomena are in no way connected, according to Earth Observatory.\nBear Island\nDutch explorers first discovered Bear Island in the late 16th century and named it after a polar bear (Ursus maritimus) that was seen swimming nearby. However, polar bears are rarely seen on the island, which is one of the most southern points in Svalbard and is rarely accessible to the white bears via Arctic sea ice.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nFor example, in 2019, researchers stationed at the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya weather station spotted a polar bear for the first time in more than 8 years, according to PolarBearScience.com.\nInstead, the island's most abundant residents include foxes, seals and seabirds. In total, around 1 million seabirds gather along the island's cliffs every year during the breeding season, according to Earth Observatory.\nHowever, in recent years, fears have been raised about how these birds and the rest of the island's ecosystem could be impacted by an unusual spike in radioactivity leaking from a Cold War-era nuclear submarine, K-278 Komsomolets, which sunk to the seafloor in 1989 roughly 115 miles (185 km) southwest of Bear Island.\nIn 2019, the BBC reported that the levels of radiation in the water surrounding the submarine were 800,000 times higher than normal, thanks to continued leakage from the vessel's reactor. However, it is still unclear whether this could be impacting the wider marine environment.\nHarry is a U.K.-based senior staff writer at Live Science.

      "text": "Earth from space: Warped 'double rainbow' glory appears next to rare cloud swirls over Mexican island\nA 2012 satellite photo captured an unusual \"double rainbow\" glory appearing next to an unconnected chain of rare vortices in the clouds above Mexico's Guadalupe Island.\nWhere is it? Guadalupe Island, Pacific Ocean\nWhat's in the photo? A rainbow 'glory' alongside von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices\nWhich satellite took the photo? NASA's Terra satellite\nWhen was it taken? June 21, 2012\nThis 2012 satellite photo shows a unique perspective of a rare, rainbow-like phenomenon, known as a glory, that appeared next to a Mexican island just as the landmass spawned a separate series of equally uncommon cloud vortices.\nGlories are multicolor light shows similar to rainbows, with one key difference: While rainbows form via a combination of reflection and refraction when sunlight bounces off falling rain droplets and splits into different wavelengths, glories are created by backward diffraction \u2014 when light bounces directly off even smaller water droplets in clouds or mist, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. Because of this, glories only appear exactly opposite the sun, known as the anti-solar point.\nThis glory appeared adjacent to Guadalupe Island in the Pacific Ocean, around 150 miles (240 km) off the western coast of Mexico, and seemed to stretch for more than 300 miles (480 kilometers). Although there appear to be two distinct glories running parallel to one another, it is a single entity.\nIn the image, a line of eerily perfect cloud swirls, known as Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices, trail off the island's southernmost point. These swirling structures are formed when clouds get caught up in an airflow that has been disrupted by a tall landmass, most often above an ocean. In this case, the disruption is caused by a volcanic mountain ridge in the north of Guadalupe Island, which rises more than 4,200 feet (1,300 meters) above sea level.\nWhile the glory and vortices are both only visible because of the thick stratocumulus clouds covering this part of the Pacific, their appearances are not connected to one another.\nRelated: See all the best images of Earth from space\nNormally, glories appear as concentric multicolor circles when viewed from the ground or in the air because the diffracted light radiates outward as it bounces back toward the observer. Even from space, the rainbow-like phenomena often look circular, as was the case when NASA's Columbia space shuttle viewed the first glory from orbit in 2003.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nHowever, in this case, the Terra satellite that captured the photo \"scans the Earth\u2019s surface in swaths perpendicular to the path followed by the satellite,\" Earth Observatory representatives wrote. So in the image, the rainbow streaks are cross-sections of the same circular glory that has been scanned twice by the satellite.\nAs a result, the rainbow streaks run parallel on either side of the satellite's trajectory above our planet. The colors in each streak are perfectly inverted compared to the other: From left to right, the rainbow on the left of the image runs from red to blue and the rainbow on the right runs from blue to red.\nUntil recently, scientists had only ever seen glories on Earth or within the dense clouds of Venus. However, in April, astronomers detected what they believe to be the first extrasolar glory on the distant \"hell planet\" WASP-76 b, around 637 light-years from our planet, suggesting they might be more common than we realized.\nHarry is a U.K.-based senior staff writer at Live Science.

      "text": "Anchorage, AK\nWeather Forecast Office\nIt may be wild to think that the atmosphere around you is a fluid that is constant motion. On our human scale, we are aware of this motion when wind blows or when you encounter a a current running along a beach while you are swimming. Yet, your eyes alone rarely observe the larger scale phenomena of fluid motion in the atmosphere. Luckily, science and technology have progressed in such a way that we can visualize this information in real time. So what are we looking at?\nThe phenomena shown are known as Von Karman vortices. They are named after Theodore Von Karman, who first described this in the atmosphere and who also was a co-founder of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Von Karman vortices look like spirals that form in the clouds in the wind-wake of islands. As a prevailing wind encounters the island, the disturbance in the flow propagates downstream of the island in the form of a double row of vortices which alternate their direction of rotation.\nThis animated image was obtained on March 25th, 2017 from the Himawari 8 satellite. Himawari-8 is operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency and the imagery is courtesy of the JMA. The data was taken from the 0.5 km resolution, red or visible channel 0.64 \u03bcm imager. In this example, lower level winds are flowing from the east/southeast to the west/northwest along Unimak Island. It's hard to tell if these vortices are being formed from only the Westdahl Volcano (that reaches to over 5,000 ft in altitude). Inspection reveals that Shishaldin (at 9,300 ft) may also be aiding in these cloud features. From start to finish, we are observing about 4 hours of data in this animation.\nWe've slowed the image down to a single frame to dissect it for easier interpretation.\nCredit is due to the JMA for the imagery and also to NASA for much of the verbiage.

Located in the southwestern Indian Ocean and only accessible by boat, the small volcanic island is situated 4,000 kilometers southwest of Western Australia, 4,700 kilometers southeast of Africa, and 1,000 kilometers north of Antarctica.\nWhen the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured this image of Heard Island, just the tip of Mawson Peak\u2014the highest point on the island\u2014was visible through the sheet of marine stratocumulus clouds swirling over this part of the Furious Fifties. Though just 2,745 meters (9,006 feet), the mountain was tall enough to stir up several cloud vortices that swirled downwind like eddies in a fast-moving river.\nTheodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, a Hungarian-American physicist, was the first to describe the physical processes that create long chains of spiral eddies like the ones shown above. Known as von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices, the patterns can form nearly anywhere that fluid flow is disturbed by an object. In this case, the unique flow occurs as winds streamed around Mawson Peak. As winds were diverted around the mountain, the disturbance in the flow propagated downstream in the form of vortices that alternate their direction of rotation.\nOften, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices form relatively straight lines of eddies; in this case, powerful southerly winds appear to be pushing the vortices northward. You can view the scene on the Worldview browser to get a broader view of the vortices trailing north.\nNASA image by Jeff Schmaltz, LANCE/EOSDIS Rapid Response. Caption by Adam Voiland."

These phenomena, known as von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices, occur when prevailing winds interact with landmasses, creating alternating vortices that disrupt the airflow. The vortices were particularly notable due to their significant contortion and the thick cloud coverage that formed concentrated gaps, a rarity for such formations typically observed as wispy trails.",
