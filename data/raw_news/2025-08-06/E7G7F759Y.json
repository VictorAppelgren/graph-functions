  "description": "Humanized AI seeks to use AI to create a blended approach that enhances rather than replaces humans.",
  "content": "Smart, scalable and people-centered solutions should be at the heart of everything we do in healthcare.\n\nBefore the digital revolution transformed healthcare, paper-based systems and traditional contact centers were the foundation of most operational workflows. However, today's demands and fast-paced environment have rendered these manual processes unsustainable, inefficient and prone to risk.\n\nHaving spent my career leading digital innovation across a range of healthcare organizations\u2014including managed care organizations, Medicaid programs and self-directed care providers\u2014I've always been fascinated by how tools can improve outcomes, reduce friction and give individuals more control over their care.\n\nBut innovation, including technologies like AI, is only meaningful when it serves people. Let's look at how we can work to deliver future-ready healthcare systems with AI that put people at the center.\n\nHistorically, managing paper records has required significant time and labor, leading to frequent delays, lost productivity, escalating administrative costs and quality issues. Similarly, legacy contact centers face limitations with high agent turnover, long wait times and outdated tools.\n\nThese factors not only impact efficiency but also drastically take away from the overall patient experience.\n\nAs a study from the National Library of Medicine comparing paper-based with electronic patient records found, \u201cInconsistencies between a patient's electronic and paper-based medical record can lead to significant problems for the health care staff in daily practice.\u201d\n\nThe modern consumer expects fast, personalized support across multiple channels. In fact, as reported by The Lund Report, 30% of patients have left an appointment due to long waits, and 20% have switched doctors for the same reason.\n\nTraditional methods are also often vulnerable to data loss, security risks, limited accessibility and service inconsistencies that may hinder both communications and compliance. These challenges highlight an urgent need for smarter, scalable solutions in healthcare operations.\n\nThe New Age Of AI\n\nAI has quickly evolved from a niche technology to a transformative force in healthcare. What began with automating simple tasks like appointment scheduling or form processing has now expanded into sophisticated applications such as predictive analytics, natural language processing and real-time clinical decision support.\n\nBut the concern is that AI could cause healthcare to lose the human touch.\n\nTo solve this, humanized AI seeks to use AI to create a blended approach that enhances rather than replaces humans. This idea is founded in empathy and context awareness to create systems that support patients and providers in more intuitive, effective ways.\n\nDr. Jonathan H. Chen, assistant professor of medicine at Stanford, sums up the idea nicely: \"'What is a computer good at? What is a human good at?' We may need to rethink where we use and combine those skills and for which tasks we recruit AI.\"\n\nOrganizations are using humanized AI to create scalable, more intentional experiences for their teams and patients. For example, NRC Health created an AI engine, Huey, to keep the human experience at the center of healthcare.\n\nFrom AI-powered chatbots delivering 24/7 support to predictive models that flag high-risk patients before emergencies occur, these tools can reshape healthcare delivery. Humanized AI solves some of healthcare\u2019s most persistent operational burdens, such as streamlining patient intake systems, verifying data in real time, reducing administrative workload and providing multilingual support, which enables human teams to focus on more complex and personal interactions.\n\nAs Dr. Rachel Callcut, associate professor of surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, explains in a recent report from GE Healthcare and the MIT Technology Review, \"By focusing on areas that patients, providers or systems are invested in addressing, we have set the stage for more rapid adoption and dissemination of AI.\u201d\n\nWhat excites me most about AI in healthcare isn\u2019t just the technology itself\u2014it\u2019s the potential to remove friction from people\u2019s lives.\n\nLeading the implementation of humanized AI at my organization was both an exciting and humbling experience. From the beginning, our goal was clear: to automate repetitive, paper-based workflows and contact center processes so we could improve efficiency and reduce human error. Throughout the process, however, I learned some valuable lessons:\n\nThe first is to engage early and often. We initially thought we had accounted for every business need\u2014but our team quickly flagged key issues we hadn\u2019t considered. It's, therefore, crucial to involve subject matter experts and frontline team members in the earliest stages of planning.\n\nSecond, always have a backup plan. We pushed forward with an aggressive implementation timeline but overlooked the fact that AI systems operate on preset logic and improve over time. The lesson here is simple: Build a plan B to ensure business continuity while AI systems are learning.\n\nFinally, implement in phases. Rolling everything out at once sounds efficient, but we learned that a phased approach gave us the space to incorporate real-time feedback and refine our plan for long-term success.\n\nA the GE Healthcare and MIT Technology Review report cited above found, \u201c80% of business and administrative healthcare professionals believe AI will make them more competitive providers.\u201d\n\nI agree with this. AI tools can transform how patients experience care. But it\u2019s not about replacing people or implementing AI at the expense of the patient experience. It\u2019s about making healthcare more responsive, more human and more efficient. Not someday, but today.\n\nis an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.",

      "text": "9th Annual Vitals Wait Time Report Released\n30% of Patients Have Left A Doctor Appointment Because of Wait Time\nNEW YORK, March XX, 2018 \u2013 There are several factors that come together to create a satisfying patient experience \u2013 clean office, friendly reception, attentive physician. Add to that list a reasonable wait time.\nNow in its 9th year, the Vitals Index finds that 84 percent of people believe wait time is either \u201csomewhat important\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d to the overall experience at a doctor\u2019s office. In fact, 30 percent of people reported they\u2019ve walked out of an appointment due to long waits. What\u2019s more, 1 in 5 report they\u2019ve changed doctors because of long wait times.\nThe importance of wait time can be seen in the correlation between the amount of time a patient waits and a doctor\u2019s average rating. Physicians with five-stars, the highest doctor rating on Vitals, had a 13-minute, 17 second wait on average. In contrast, doctors with a 1-star, the lowest rating, had a wait time average of 34-minute, 11 second wait.\nWait Time Effect on Doctor Rating\nStar Rating\nAverage Wait Time\n5\n13 min, 17 sec\n4\n21 min, 32 sec\n3\n22 min, 11 sec\n2\n29 min, 34 sec\n1\n34 min, 11 sec\nSurprisingly, people with poor access to health care were more likely to walk out of an appointment because of a long wait time. Only 20 percent of people who reported having excellent access to top-quality doctors said they\u2019ve walked out of an appointment because of a long wait. In comparison, 53 percent of people who reported having poor access to health care have left a doctor\u2019s office due to long waits.\nSTATE OF THE WAIT\nAcross specialties, the average wait time for a doctor in America currently stands at 18 minutes, 13 seconds. That\u2019s down 22 seconds from last year, and the fourth consecutive decrease in wait times.\nBut how long a patient waits depends on where they live. For the second year in a row, Milwaukee ranked on top with the shortest wait time of 12 minutes 47 seconds. El Paso has been riding an even longer trend. For seven years, the city has placed at the bottom of the ranking. In fact, its average wait time increased one minute year-over-year, to an average 26 minutes 50 seconds.\n2018 Cities with Shortest Wait Time\nCity\nAverage Wait Time\nMilwaukee\n14 min, 35 sec\nSeattle\n14 min, 38 sec\nSaint Paul\n14 min, 43 sec\nMinneapolis\n14 min, 55 sec\nPortland\n15 min, 6 sec\n2018 Cities with Longest Wait Time\nCity\nAverage Wait Time\nEl Paso\n26 min, 50 sec\nMemphis\n23 min, 44 sec\nMiami\n22 min, 29 sec\nLas Vegas\n21 min, 19 sec\nFort Worth\n21 min, 1 sec\nOn the state level, Wisconsin leapfrogged New Hampshire for the lead this year. The Granite State added two minutes to their wait time over last year. The bad news is that for states at the bottom, the wait is only getting longer. Nearly all the states in the bottom five added one minute to their wait time year-over-year. For the fourth year, Alabama ranked last with an average wait time of 22 minutes, 19 seconds.\n2018 States with Shortest Wait Time\nState\nAverage Wait Time\nWisconsin\n13 min, 23 sec\nNew Hampshire\n14 min, 17 sec\nWashington\n15 min, 2 sec\nMaine\n15 min, 8 sec\nMinnesota\n15 min, 10 sec\n2018 States with Longest Wait Time\nState\nAverage Wait Time\nAlabama\n22 min, 19 sec\nMississippi\n22 min, 13 sec\nWest Virginia\n21 min, 23 sec\nLouisiana\n20 min, 35 sec\nNevada\n20 min, 29 sec\nSo what do people do as they wait for a doctor? As a sign of the time, 44 percent said they look at their phone or another electronic device. But doctors shouldn\u2019t cancel their magazine subscriptions just yet. About 55 percent said they browse through the stacks of glossies in waiting rooms.\nVitals\u2019 annual Physician Wait Time Report, now in its ninth year, was compiled from patient-reported wait times from 2008 through the end of 2017. Vitals also surveyed over 675 online respondents in a March 2018 poll."

      "text": "The Future of Healthcare Experience: Human Understanding at the Core\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, the focus on human experience is now more critical than ever. At NRC Health, the mission is clear: to champion Human Understanding in healthcare, ensuring that every interaction is meaningful and compassionate. Jennifer Baron, Chief Experience Officer, and Toya Gorley, Improvement Advisor, share their insights on how NRC Health is paving the way for a more empathetic and effective healthcare environment in 2025 and beyond.\nA holistic view of the human experience in healthcare\nFor Baron, improving the human experience involves acknowledging the full spectrum of what it means to be human\u2014encompassing body, mind, and spirit. In healthcare, there is often a tendency to focus solely on the physical, but true wellness stems from understanding the values, preferences, and beliefs that drive human behavior. Baron emphasizes, \u201cHuman experience starts with Human Understanding.\u201d It is this understanding that allows healthcare providers to support optimal wellness holistically.\nGorley echoes this sentiment, highlighting the importance of acknowledging the emotional context of healthcare. \u201cImproving the human experience involves understanding what matters most to everyone you serve,\u201d she explains. This deeper understanding enables the design of empathetic, reliable, and consistent experiences for patients, employees, and healthcare consumers alike.\nBridging data and empathy\nBoth leaders stress the importance of balancing data with emotion in experience work. Baron points out the natural tension between understanding the data and hearing the story behind it. By embracing both, experience leaders can teach others to navigate this balance effectively, fostering a healthcare environment that is both informed and empathetic.\nGorley adds that experience leaders have the power to inspire transformation within healthcare. By reminding colleagues of the meaningful purpose behind every task and sharing positive news alongside opportunities for improvement, leaders can uplift and motivate. Collaboration and innovation are key, as they simplify experiences and ensure efforts are aligned across organizations.\nInnovative approaches at NRC Health\nNRC Health is at the forefront of integrating advanced technology with compassionate care. Baron is particularly excited about the introduction of Huey, the first healthcare-centric AI engine built specifically for experience management, which supports the mission of Human Understanding. This powerful suite of tools empowers client partners to enhance the human experience in healthcare and focus on what matters most.\nGorley is equally enthusiastic about NRC Health\u2019s development of AI, which facilitates a deeper understanding of the needs of patients, employees, and healthcare consumers. By integrating AI with tools that promote compassionate care, NRC Health is setting new standards in human experience, ensuring that both patients and care providers feel seen, heard, and respected.\nLooking ahead\nThe work of improving the human experience in healthcare is ongoing, but with leaders like Baron and Gorley at the helm, the path is clear. By prioritizing Human Understanding and embracing innovation, NRC Health is making significant strides toward a healthcare system that truly cares for the whole person."
