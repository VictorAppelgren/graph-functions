  "title": "The Good, Bad And Ugly The Green Bay Packers\u2019 Joint Practice With The Colts",
  "description": "The Green Bay Packers and Indianapolis Colts had a spirited practice Thursday that was dominated by both defenses.",
  "content": "Just minutes before the Green Bay Packers and Indianapolis Colts held a joint practice Thursday, Packers coach Matt LaFleur was asked what he was looking for.\n\n\u201cI expect our guys to compete to the best of their ability and keep it clean,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cI think that\u2019s reasonable to expect. We haven't had any of those in practice. I don\u2019t see why it has to happen now.\n\n\u201cThe beauty is they\u2019re an AFC team, we\u2019re an NFC team. We don\u2019t play each other in the regular season. If we play each other at the end of this thing, that\u2019s a win for everybody. So, the goal is just to get better today.\n\nFor the most part, LaFleur got what he wanted.\n\nThe two teams had a spirited practice that was dominated by both defenses. Now, Green Bay and Indianapolis will meet in the second preseason game of the year Saturday at noon.\n\nHere\u2019s the good, bad and ugly from the joint practice compiled from multiple reports.\n\nLOVE STORY: Two days after undergoing surgery to repair a ligament in non-throwing (left) thumb, Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love was in Indianapolis with his team.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in great spirits. He\u2019s here with us,\u201d Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. \u201cSo, yeah, now it\u2019s about just about putting in the work to get the thumb rehabbed.\u201d\n\nLove was injured after taking a sack on his final snap of the preseason opener on Aug. 9 against the New York Jets.\n\nLove won't take the field for joint practices and exhibition games against both Indianapolis and Seattle over the next nine days. He could practice as early as next week, though, and expects to be fully healthy for Week 1.\n\n\u201cI think with the timeframe that we have right now, finishing up training camp and preseason and heading into the season with the choice to be going into the season 100% healthy was definitely the call I wanted to make,\u201d Love said. \u201cDealing with injuries last year, I wanted to go into this thing feeling good.\u201d\n\nUNDER PRESSURE: Green Bay finished ninth in the league with 45 sacks last season. The Packers\u2019 pressure was inconsistent, though, and defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley had to get creative with his blitz packages.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case Thursday, as the Packers got after Indianapolis quarterbacks throughout.\n\nEarly in practice, end Rashan Gary beat right tackle Braden Smith for a sack. Moments later, end Lukas Van Ness beat left tackle Bernhard Raimann for sack of his own.\n\nLater, linebackers Quay Walker and Ty\u2019Ron Hopper got home on blitzes, and defensive tackle Colby Wooden had a sack after a dominant inside rush.\n\nVan Ness added a second sack before the practice was over, and rookie Barryn Sorrell had a sack of his own.\n\n\u201cWe came together collectively after the Jets game and knew we had to come out with a little more passion, a little more fight,\u201d Van Ness said. \u201cI think we did today.\u201d\n\nGETTING DEFENSIVE: The Colts were a middle-of-the-pack 13th in total offense and 17th in scoring offense last season. The Packers made them look like a bottom feeder throughout the day, though.\n\nIn addition to Green Bay\u2019s consistent pressure, cornerbacks Keisean Nixon and Johnathan Baldwin had interceptions. Linebacker Isaiah Simmons had an interception in the 2-minute drill and safety Evan Williams recovered a fumble that was forced by fellow safety Javon Bullard.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to keep stacking,\u201d Van Ness said. \u201cAs good as it was, I look at the bad things. I think we gotta close out practice better. That\u2019s something to look forward to and improve and be better for moving forward.\u201d\n\nAUTOMATIC: Kicker Brandon McManus was 5-for-5 on field goals and is now 61 of 65 on all of his kicks this summer (93.8%). McManus made field goals from 38, 41, 44, 47 and 56 yards.\n\nRookie Mark McNamee also made all three of his kicks, connecting from 45 yards twice and also drilling a 47-yarder.\n\nTHIS AND THAT: Left tackle Rasheed Walker (groin) returned to practice. Walker, who\u2019s made 35 starts at left tackle the last two seasons, is battling second-year man Jordan Morgan for that job. \u2026 Running back Israel Abandikanda (hamstring) also returned to practice. \u2026 Green Bay No. 4 quarterback Taylor Elgersma completed four straight passes in a 2-minute drill late in practice, but that drive eventually died.\n\nHEAD \u2018HUNTER\u2019: Colts rookie safety Hunter Wohler, a former standout at the University of Wisconsin and Muskego High School, sent Packers rookie wideout Matthew Golden to the ground with a shoulder shot.\n\nGolden was running a crossing route, quarterback Malik Willis overthrew him, then Wohler sent him to the ground. Packers tight end Tucker Kraft got in Wohler\u2019s face, but things didn't escalate.\n\nANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST: Wide receiver Romeo Doubs suffered a back injury in Tuesday\u2019s practice and missed the joint practice. Wideouts Jayden Reed (foot), Dontayvion Wicks (calf) and Savion Williams (hamstring) also didn't practice.\n\nThat meant of the Packers\u2019 top five receivers, only rookie Matthew Golden was available.\n\nFROM THE INFIRMARY: In addition to the Packers\u2019 dearth of wideouts, the following players didn\u2019t practice: quarterback Jordan Love, safeties Xavier McKinney and Zayne Anderson, and cornerback Nate Hobbs.\n\nOFFENSIVE: The Packers were without quarterback Jordan Love and four of their top five receivers. So it was really no surprise that the offense had a tough day.\n\nIn a two-minute drill at the end of practice, quarterback Malik Willis went 0-for-4.\n\nWillis also had a rough start playing with several receivers that are extreme long shots to make the final roster. Willis did complete a 35-yard pass to Mecole Hardman and a 20-yarder to Julian Hicks midway through the practice, but overall the offense struggled.\n\n\u201cOur youth showed a little bit in some instances with the injuries that we have on our depth chart,\u201d tight end Tucker Kraft said. \u201cSo we had guys coming up and playing. We're out here, full pads, expecting big things from some of the guys that we're elevating and just, we left some meat on the bone.\n\n\u201cWe were doing a good job competing, but we know the level that we expect to play at and I personally just didn't \u2014 I didn't think that we had all \u2014 we didn't empty the tank.\u201d",
