  "description": "See the likely path and wind arrival times for Lorena",
  "content": "Lorena was a tropical storm in the North Pacific Ocean Tuesday morning Pacific time, the National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory.\n\nLorena is the 12th named storm to form in the Eastern Pacific in 2025.\n\nWhat does the storm look like from above? Satellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.\n\nHurricane season in the Eastern Pacific began on May 15, two weeks before the Atlantic season started. Both seasons run through Nov. 30.\n\nStorms that form in the Atlantic or the Pacific generally move west, away from mainland North America.\n\nHowever, an air mass can sometimes block a storm, driving it north or northeast toward the Baja California peninsula and the west coast of Mexico. Occasionally, a storm can move farther north, as Hurricane Hilary did in 2023, bringing damaging winds and intense rain to Southern California.\n\nTracking map Tracking data is from the National Hurricane Center. The map shows probabilities of at least 5 percent. The forecast is for up to five days, with that time span starting up to three hours before the reported time that the storm reaches its latest location. Wind speed probability data is not available north of 60.25 degrees north latitude. Intensity chart Best track and forecast path are from the National Hurricane Center. Wind arrivals table Arrival times are generated from a New York Times analysis of National Hurricane Center data. Geographic locations use data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Natural Earth. Time zones are based on Google. The table shows predicted arrival times of sustained, damaging winds of 58 m.p.h. or more for select cities with a chance of such winds reaching them. If damaging winds reach a location, there is no more than a 10 percent chance that they will arrive before the \u201cearliest reasonable\u201d time and a 50 percent chance they will arrive before the \u201cmost likely\u201d time. Radar map Radar imagery is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration via Iowa State University. These mosaics are generated by combining individual radar stations that comprise the NEXRAD network. Storm surge map Storm surge data is from the National Hurricane Center. Forecasts only include the United States Gulf and Atlantic coasts, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The actual areas that could become flooded may differ from the areas shown on this map. This map accounts for tides, but not waves and not flooding caused by rainfall. The map also includes intertidal areas, which routinely flood during typical high tides. Rip currents map Rip current data is from the National Hurricane Center. Rip current risk shown is not always associated with active tropical cyclones. Satellite map Imagery is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Japanese Meteorological Agency via the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere. Precipitation map Data for multi-day forecasts or observed rainfall totals are from the National Weather Service. The 1-day forecast is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Historical map Storm paths are from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s HURDAT database. Only storms with names that formed after the year 2000 and that are within 50 miles of the potential landfall location are shown. Note: All basemaps are built with Daylight (urban areas); Natural Earth (roads, labels, terrain)",

SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION ---------------------------------------------- LOCATION...18.3N 107.9W ABOUT 240 MI...385 KM W OF MANZANILLO MEXICO ABOUT 345 MI...550 KM SSE OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES WATCHES AND WARNINGS -------------------- There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect. Interests in southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur should monitor the progress of this system. A Tropical Storm Watch could be required for portions of Baja California Sur later today or on Wednesday. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK ---------------------- At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lorena was located near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 107.9 West. Lorena is moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this motion is expected to continue for the next few days before slowing and turning north then northeastward toward the latter portion of this week. Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours and Lorena could reach hurricane strength by Wednesday. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ---------------------- RAINFALL: Areas of heavy rainfall well east and northeast of Tropical Storm Lorena will continue to impact portions of northwestern Mexico from the states of Colima to Sinaloa today, with isolated flash flooding possible in areas of mountainous terrain. Bands of heavy rainfall are expected to begin impacting Baja California Sur by Wednesday and potentially persist through Friday, with rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches, with maximum amounts of 12 inches possible across portions of Baja California Sur and southwestern Sonora through Friday. Uncertainty remains with these totals, and locally higher or lower amounts are possible depending on the track and strength of the system. Potentially significant flash flooding is a possibility. NEXT ADVISORY ------------- Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST. $$ Forecaster Gallina"
