      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nThe Reveal: Our Top Short-Term Stock Pick for 2025\nThis is the moment when most newsletters put up a paywall and ask you to spend $99.99 to find out the name of the stock.\nBut we\u2019re not doing that today.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nAt Insider Monkey, we believe in earning your trust first\u2014by delivering real value, upfront.

      "text": "On Monday\u2019s episode of Mad Money, host Jim Cramer warned viewers about how unchecked enthusiasm in the market can quickly become a serious danger.\n\u201cRemember, we have two markets going here, the normal one and the super speculative one that\u2019s made up of various cryptocurrencies and the stocks that back them\u2026 But of all the speculation we\u2019re seeing here, nothing repulses me more than the red-hot IPO market because when IPOs get too hot, they can lead to a bull market slaughterhouse.\u201d\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Commented on Magnificent Seven Stocks and Jim Cramer Spoke About These 18 Stocks.\nCramer pushed back on the idea that soaring prices should be embraced just because people are making money in the short term. He reminded viewers of the painful lessons from the past, asking:\n\u201cDon\u2019t we wish the dot-com bubble hadn\u2019t happened? Don\u2019t we wish the 2022 meltdown hadn\u2019t happened? It was stuff like this that drove it. The syndicate desks were clueless to what was really happening.\u201d\nCramer acknowledged that these desks cannot completely control speculation, but argued they should be able to recognize when first-day price spikes signal that market dynamics have changed. He went on to say that syndicate desks should not encourage gamblers or act helpless in the face of irrational demand. He warned that that kind of passivity is not what long-term investors need. He noted that the goal should be investing for actual returns, not chasing hype.\n\u201cThe Circles, the Figmas, the crypto stocks, they\u2019re all what\u2019s wrong with the market, not what\u2019s right. The syndicate desks, who do the pricing, need to know that once there\u2019s more wrong than right, this bull will turn into a bear, and their earnings at their companies will go up in smoke.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money aired on August 4. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the first quarter of 2025, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n14 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar\n14. Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: N/A\nCircle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar. Cramer discussed the company\u2019s price movement after its IPO during the episode, as he said:\n\u201cNext up, the larger deal was Circle Internet Group. The IPO market was starting to heat up\u2026 by the time Circle came public in early June. But even though Circle upsized its deal significantly and raised its offer price range and then still priced well above the high end of the range, it wasn\u2019t ambitious enough. Deal priced at 31, but the stock opened for trading at 69. Within three weeks, it was nearly at 300. It\u2019s since cooled off around, they\u2019ve come down to 165, but that\u2019s still probably way too high. I think winners from CoreWeave rolled their take into Circle and turned it into a meme stock.\u201d\nCircle Internet (NYSE:CRCL) operates a platform for stablecoin and blockchain applications, as it provides U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins and related financial infrastructure.\n13. CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 36\nCoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar. Cramer said that he is a \u201chuge fan\u201d of the business but finds the stock \u201cpretty expensive.\u201d He stated:\n\u201cRight now, IPOs have become the new meme stocks, and the investment banks doing the offerings don\u2019t seem to know it. The meme trend began with CoreWeave, which came public at 40, incredibly small float or amount that was offered for trading. The underwriters\u2019 anxious for the deal to work. Prices on the whole are way lower than they thought they, they would have to do, and then they downsized the offering, selling just 37.5 million shares, raising just 1.5 billion. They originally hoped for something that\u2019s a billion dollars more than that. Now, CoreWeave is worth over 50 billion. The stock was initially driven up by memesters, who knew there was no new supply, so they just kept buying and buying and buying. How do I know this? Because it\u2019s a pattern that I\u2019ve seen since 1998. I recognize it. CoreWeave, a data center company, was simply very easy to take up because there wasn\u2019t much supply, especially after the deal was downsized. I\u2019m a huge fan of the business, but the stock\u2019s pretty expensive.\u201d\nCoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) provides a cloud platform optimized for generative AI that provides GPU and CPU compute, storage, networking, and managed services. The company supports workloads like model training, AI inference, and rendering, and includes tools for infrastructure management and dataset optimization."

      "text": "David Grain, Founder & CEO of Grain Management, joined CNBC on May 1 to discuss the AI-driven demand for data centers and tariff uncertainty. The main concerns regarding tariffs are the potential impact on costs, the resilience of supply chains, and the overall effect on business operations and their expansion. He also shared his perspective on why investors are still confident in the broadband and digital infrastructure sector. He characterized broadband as universally essential and emphasised that the demand for faster connectivity has not slowed, which is why the regulatory support for broadband expansion is globally robust. Grain noted that the administration has also met expectations for lighter regulation in the infrastructure sector, which makes it easier to advance projects and close deals. He described the admin\u2019s stance as pro-growth and supportive of secure and competitive networks. Grain also observed that infrastructure, especially broadband, is an area where there is bipartisan support, given its positive impact on economic growth at both the state and local levels.\nDeepSeek\u2019s announcement was also followed by reports that suggested that some companies might be pulling back on data center spending. However, the latest earnings reports appeared to settle at least this debate and confirmed that the investments in this sector were still ongoing.

      "text": "On April 25, Kari Firestone, Aureus Asset Management executive chairman and co-founder, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 to discuss the latest market trends and express how this is a reasonable place for long-term investors to enter the market. Despite persistent concerns about a recession coming from tariffs, Firestone thinks that corporate earnings have generally exceeded expectations. The strong performance of major tech companies has been a key driver behind the market\u2019s recent gains, such as those in the MAG7. Elaborating on the significance of these tech giants, Firestone also underscored that the top 2 companies in the S&P 500, regardless of which they are, match the market value of the bottom 300 companies in the index. This concentration means that these leading firms are fundamental to the US economy\u2019s progress.\nThe conversation then addressed the impact of proposed FDA budget cuts on innovation for biotech companies. Firestone agreed that such cuts could slow down the approval process for new products and drug manufacturing, and she advised against reducing the FDA\u2019s budget. However, she believes that the market has already priced in these risks. She compared the situation to previous market overreactions, such as the 32% drop during the early COVID-19 period, which was followed by a rapid recovery.\nFirestone also concluded that the market is now fairly valued. Some sectors offer attractive opportunities due to recent price declines. She assessed the overall market valuation in light of tariff uncertainties and the recent rebound from a 20% drop to a current decline of about 10.5%. She explained that the market\u2019s price-to-earnings multiple has decreased from 22.5x next year\u2019s earnings to 18.5x, assuming no severe recession. She\u2019s confident that the market is unlikely to end the year lower than current levels and recommends that long-term investors enter the market at this stage. Firestone believes that the market has partially priced in the impact of tariffs. She estimated that a 5% to 10% tariff is reflected in current prices. While a full-blown recession may not be entirely priced in, a slowdown likely is.\nThat being said, we\u2019re here with a list of the 30 stocks that should double in 3 years.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through financial media reports and Reddit threads to compile a list of the top 30 stocks that should double in 3 years.
