It's sturdy, waterproof, has a forgivingly long wireless range, and it even floats in water, making it perfect for any situation from camping trips to pool parties, or just casual listening. I like that Ultimate Ears chose a simplistic look with bold colors for these speakers, and the silicone base helps ensure that they stay put. My only gripe is that the Outdoor and Podcast EQs kind of sacrifice some clarity to push the volume in their respective directions, but the standard EQ is so rich and the speaker is so outspoken that either problem these modes attempt to solve are really non-issues, and the fact you can pair up two of these speakers for full two-channel stereo is a big plus. In addition, the regular sound signature is so clear that you can crank the volume with no noticeable distortion. I also wish you could skip back a track with the onboard controls, but doing it on your device isn't that much of a hassle. For this price range and size, I'd say the Wonderboom 4 should be your first choice for a portable bluetooth speaker.\n- Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2025Color: BlackVerified PurchaseWorks great, the sound quality is fantastic! projects exceptionally well. Has a podccast setting. The standard setting is a little heavy on the base, but I missplaced the manuel so I don't know if It can be adjusted. It turns off when not in use, its the perfect size, really like that you can hang it up. Cennnectivity is easy, stays connected all the time you don't have to keep connecting every time it turns off like cheaper speakers. The battery lasts for days, it works while charging that a bonus and they have color options. Its very well designed and made. Good value for the money, you get what you pay for this speaker is definatly worth the price, its a high quality product. You will not be dissappointed.\n- Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2025Color: BlackVerified PurchaseWas looking for a portable speaker that could take being used while gardening and this is the ONE!. Bought one for my husband (black) and he tucks it into his golf bag plus one for me (hot pink so I can find it in the yard easily). Like that it is waterproof, so if I forget to bring it in and it gets wet- still works. Very rich sound even at high volume. Its a little bubble of a speaker with long battery life, light weight for how much sound it puts out. Charges quickly. Took it out of box and started using right away with no problems pairing with both of our phones. Easy instructions. Comes with a charging cord. It was on sale. Much less expensive than my Bose which I have had for several years and a better sound and longer battery life. Built like a tank. Has held up to being dropped, left outside overnight.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2025Color: GrayVerified PurchaseFor the price I paid I am very pleased with the wonderboom. It is easy to connect and very intuitive to use. It seems sturdy and holds a charge well. The fact that it\u2019s water and drop proof makes it great for our purposes (camping, kids, pool parties). The sound quality is good and assuming it doesn\u2019t go to put it on me I will be recommending it to others.\n- Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2025Color: BlueVerified PurchaseI have a pair of Boom 2's, several years old, that I've been using in the shower and also for travel. After about 8 years, the batteries are getting old, and the speakers are also a little bit heavy for travel. After reading the review on Rtings.com, and seeing the great Black Friday pricing, I've ordered a pair of these.\nI'm happy to report they sound essentially equivalent to the Boom 2. If there's less bass, it's mostly imperceptible. The battery life is better even than the brand-new Boom 2. They're smaller and lighter to carry, they pair more easily, they can be put in stereo mode without using an app, and they're plenty loud enough for the shower, a hotel room, or for background music when the family gathers at an AirBnB.\nThe overall sound quality is very good. No deep bass, of course, but enough so the music sounds balanced, and male voices on podcasts sound natural. Highs are extended enough for natural-sounding cymbals and strings, and the sound is clean and not distorted if the speakers aren't pushed.\nAnd exceptional travel speaker, even if you need two (and nothing beats stereo when you can separate the speakers properly).\n- Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2025Color: BlueVerified PurchaseThese speakers are splendid but my one ick is the loud start up and turn off sounds. They're cute but I really wish I had the option to turn it off. It's a little bit too loud for my liking and brings unnecessary attention when I want to play some music softly. Apparently the other UE speakers have the option to disable it on the app but the wonderbooms aren't compatible with the app. Sigh.\nOtherwise, these really are great speakers and great value for the money. I just can't use them as freely as I want to. If this isn't a non-issue for you, I think you'd be happy with them.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2025Color: BlackVerified PurchaseMan, this speaker packs a punch! The Wonderboom 4 blew me away with how much bass and volume it puts out for such a small device. It has three sound modes\u2014Standard (deep bass and loud), Outdoor (boosted volume, less bass), and Podcast (voice clarity)\u2014and each one does its job well. I mostly kept it on Standard for that rich sound.\nI bought it mainly for kayaking since it\u2019s advertised as waterproof and floatable\u2014and it delivered. Had it playing for 5\u20136 hours, and it easily filled the area around my kayak (about 130 feet) with solid sound. Toward the end of the trip, I actually flipped my kayak and the speaker got fully submerged. Pulled it out, let it charge back up, and it still works perfectly. I did grab the extended warranty just to be safe, but honestly, it\u2019s built tough.\nOnly regret? Not buying a second one so I could pair them. This thing is a beast for the size.\nTop reviews from other countries\n- NatVReviewed in Canada on May 15, 2025\n5.0 out of 5 stars Love it\nColor: GrayVerified PurchaseGreat sound where you don't expect it from such a device.

It's easy to use, easy to understand, no mechanic experience required.\nLong Review:\n08 Chev Tahoe LTZ - 143k miles - bought new\nLife is CRAZY... it's 2008 and you're married & receive a brand new $$$$$ vehicle because your self-employed husband needs the write-off and then BAM! it's 2024 and you're divorced because it really is better to 'cry on a bicycle' than get thrown up stairs because you asked where he'd been for 3 days. This Tahoe is m'girl! And I've found myself needing to take care of her because I can't afford anything else (24/7/365 \"caregiver\" for our disabled 28 year old, can't work, blah blah blah). Bought this BLUEDRIVER SCAN TOOL after doing some research and it seemed to be about as good as it gets for under $100. Fast forward less than a year and I've repaired/replaced everything BLUEDRIVER has told me, I'm down to the last thing and it's supposed to be here Sunday. Just to have the dealership read codes was going to be over $200 and require a 45 minute one way drive because the locals don't service vehicles over 10 years old. I don't even want to know what they would have charged me for the services/parts/repairs. I'll have less than $500 (thus why it's taken a year, can only do so much at a time) in once I get the P2138 taken care of next week. PRAISE GOD \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb YouTube has some really phenomenal channels - watch several videos to figure out which works best for you, watch the chosen video at least once more before jumping in, and you're golden. If a 'pretty smart petite blonde' can climb into her engine - not running \ud83d\ude09 - and replace the vapor thingy, ANYONE CAN. But this to is the first step and it does correctly identify and catalog every single code. Allows annotations of the service/repair/replacement once you've completed. Allows reports to be printed. And even when you Clear a Report, it's still available to view in the History section of the BlueDriver app.\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2025BlueDriver is an outstanding OBD2 scanner\u2014easy to set up, simple to use, and very accurate.

She bought this for me as a tool to help diagnose a issue with our vehicle. So the following are his words and not necessarily shared by the account holder.\nMy (Hubby's) thoughts on Amazon: \"They are liars and I will never order from them again! They have done nothing but screw up the shipping of this product from blaming Lemur to just plain outright telling a lie! Yes they did refund shipping and compensated my wife for this crap but it will be a COLD DAY IN HELL WHEN I WILL PURCHASE FROM AMAZON AGAIN!\" The shipping and lying fiasco is partially why the rating is low. Some of the rating comes from the product itself. So let me get the issues out of the way first and then I will get to the good things. Which there are more good than bad I promise!\nOh and another disclaimer: Use this tool as a diagnositc aid only!! This tool and others like it help point you in the direction of a fix and does not explicitly tell you what is wrong. So please use this tool to help get you pointed in the right direction. Just don't replace parts, use the tool to get direction, diagnose and then fix.\nNow to the issues I personally had with this tool:\nThe live data PIDS take several restarts of the application to get to come online. I'm not sure if this is because of a special issue with my vehicle or what the issue is. This is annoying but can be overseen. I personally am a impatient person and like stuff to work the first time around.\nThe second issue is issues that I have with a feature of the tool called Mode 6. My vehicle supports this and I was excited to see what all I can see however this is where the issues arise. The first issue is the app on the phone locks up sometimes when trying to go into mode 6. This isn't cool at all. A restart of the app fixes this as well. However once I get into mode 6, I get PID/TID readouts that are not human readable! I get TID/PID numbers and the output is in HEXIDECIMAL readout. The HEX part I know from working with computers however without a TID/PID chart, the data is WORTHLESS! In Lemur's instructional video on mode 6, they show you tapping on a TID/PID and it tells you what it does. On my vehicle, it gives some generic message which again is worthless. So mode 6 on this tool is completely worthless to me!\nA issue that seemed to correct itself through use is the repair reports. At first, I could not get the repair reports for the error codes on my vehicle then yesterday 12/29/15 I tried again and I was able to get the reports! Coolness!\nNow onto the good points!\nThe tool will work with both Apple and Android mobile devices. I only was able to test on an iPhone so I cannot say how good or bad the Android device app is. The app and tool are updateable! As Lemur finds thing that need to be patched, they allow the app and the tool to be updated which is very nice indeed!\nThe tood depending on what capabilities it knows about and what the computer allows, can not only scan engine codes but codes from other systems as well! Including ABS, Transmission and more! I ran into a snag on reading TPMS when I tested this tool on another vehicle. Lemur was notified and they are looking into a cause of why it couldn't read the codes from the TPMS systems of that vehicle. Might be that the computer didn't allow the tool access? Not sure.\nThe tool once it finds issues will reveal the codes that are being reported. Then you can get a repair report. These diagnostic aids tell you what the code is and what are the most likely culprits that are causing it. Again use this as a diagnostic aid and not gospel for finding out the issue. This I feel is a nice feature!\nThe tool can clear out the trouble codes. However I do wish that Lemur would tell you what state the car needs to be in to clear the codes. Like my vehicle has to be in the run position but engine off in order to clear the codes. Some cars need to be running. I think a safe bet here is key to run but engine off.\nThe tool can check for smog rediness which for emissions is a definite must!\nIf your vehicle supports it, the tool can check the status of the check engine light for parameters such as how long the light has been on and when the last time the light was reset. Again only if your computer supports it.\nThe tool can decode a VIN and tell you where the car was made, what engine is in it, and all sorts of goodies. The tool makes an effort to figure out the VIN from the computer. However if it cant, then you can either manually enter it with a keyboard or if your car has a VIN barcode, you can take a picture of the VIN right in the app and it will fill in that blank for you! That is awesome!\nThe live data tool is very good tool indeed! Depending on what you engine will allow to be read, you can see in real time what the engine is doing and help you narrow down what might be wrong!\nBest of all, a lot of the data from this tool like the Live Data, smog rediness, repair reports, etc can be exported out of the tool so if you need to analyze them on a computer or send to a friend that is more mechanically inclined, you can do so. A word of warning about the Live Data, it will only export out the PIDS you've selected and it only exports out data in a CSV (Comma Seperated Values) format useful in spreadsheets. It does not export out the pretty graphs ( I haven't found a way to export the graphs at least) that the tool generates.\nWould I personally consider this a professional tool? Possibly. Reasoning for my thinking is the mode 6 data/testing is useless to me as of this review. I noticed that some of the sensor PIDS are not even in the tool to be read or read in a certain way and should be if this is to be considered a professional tool.\nCase in point is the Cam and Crank sensors. Maybe this in in the mode 6 data however I do not know because again I can't read it and I cannot gain access to a TID/PID chart for this. Reason why reading the cam and crank sensors would be good is for a crank but no start condition. Even if we had a PID that would tell us that the cam and crank was in sync would help here. Without reading this data, this tool cannot help you with a crank but no start.\nAt least on my vehicle which happens to be a 02 Jeep Liberty.\nHowever if you need a fairly inexpensive tool that is compact, fairly easy to use, updateable, IMHO very good support and can be used a a way to constantly monitor the vehicle (you can leave plugged in), this tool can definitly help with your vehicular woes. Maybe when the tool gets more updates, I will come back and update this review.\nIf y'all are wondering if this has helped me with our vehicle? The answer is yes! I was able to get some live data and it is pointing to a few things that could be wrong with the vehicle. Once I get a clear day, I will get to cracking on this!\nHope this helps someone.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2025Had it for a while and its worth much more than what i paid for it.\nZero problems.\nConnects.

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2022I just received my 75 inch Amazon Fire TV QLED today and here are my thoughts:\nDelivery/Unboxing/Setup: Delivery was a breeze. It was delivered right into my apartment (I was home when they arrived). Unboxing was made easy by the box lifting off of the top of the TV instead of having to pull the TV out of the box. Setup was easy, it has prompts to connect to WIFI, etc., and it even lets you restore settings from another Fire TV if your prior TV was a Fire TV (which I did).\nPicture Quality: Really cannot complain here. I was able to adjust the picture and color settings to my liking, and the picture looks crisp with great color. There are so many different picture settings. Of course you will get varying degrees of quality based on how the content is broadcast (4k, UHD, HD, SD, etc.), but overall the picture quality is definitely much improved from my prior Insignia 58 inch Fire TV model from a few years ago. I turned on live sports and there is no stuttering/judder that I can see. The adaptive brightness seems to really help, especially with the display of colors vs. black as the black on my old Fire TV always looked more grey than black.\nAmbient Mode: A fantastic addition that I am sure I will enjoy more as time passes. This mode allows for artwork and/or widgets to be displayed on the TV all of the time when you are not watching it. It even gives you the choice of what types of artwork you want to display (such as Impressionist or Modernist) and what types of widgets (such as time, weather, or your calendar). You can ask Alexa to tell you about the artwork or simply click upwards on the remote and it will tell you the title and creator of the artwork. With how great the picture quality appears and how small of a border there is, it really does look like you have a painting on the wall. On par with the Samsung Frame at a fraction of the price. It is supposed to sense when you are in the room and turn off when you are out of the room, haven't tested that yet.\nBuilt In Alexa: A great feature that I didn't realize I was missing in my old Fire TV. I have plenty of Echo dots lying around the house that were able to connect to my prior TV, but I would have to turn around to speak at them and they never seems to control my TV very well. Having Alexa built in means I can speak right towards the TV and it can control all kinds of things like navigation programs, volume, turning the TV on/off, and telling your about the ambient artwork that is displayed.\nInternal Storage: This was a big issue for me with my last fire TV and it seems like it should be resolved with this one. My last Fire TV had less than 5GB of internal storage and it was always telling me that I was low on space and needed to delete apps. This TV has 11.32 GB of available internal storage, so more than double my last fire TV. Very happy about that. There is also a USB port to add external storage, but it remains to be seen which apps it will allow you to put on external storage as my last TV wouldn't let most apps be stored externally.\nInputs/Ports: The TV has the following inputs/outputs: 1 Ethernet/LAN, 4 HDMI ports (1 of which is an HDMI (eARC) port), 1 Antenna/Cable, 1 USB, 1 IR emitter port, 1 Audio out/Headphone, and 1 Optical audio output. I connected my soundbar via the HDMI (eARC) port and it is great because I can control the soundbar volume with the TV remote or with Alexa. The TV also came with an IR emitter in the box.\nRemote: It comes with the standard Alexa voice remote, which is similar to the remote for my last Insignia Fire TV. This one has a \"Settings\" button which makes navigation to the settings menu much easier. Batteries are included. Wish it came with the Pro remote, but I have already ordered that to pair with this TV.\nOverall: 5 Stars. If you are looking for a TV with the familiarity and ease of use of the Fire TV and Alexa ecosystem, with great picture quality for a TV of this size/price, then I think this is a great value!\nWill update if anything changes!\n5.0 out of 5 starsI just received my 75 inch Amazon Fire TV QLED today and here are my thoughts:Amazon Fire TV QLED - Exceeds expectations!\nReviewed in the United States on November 2, 2022\nDelivery/Unboxing/Setup: Delivery was a breeze. It was delivered right into my apartment (I was home when they arrived). Unboxing was made easy by the box lifting off of the top of the TV instead of having to pull the TV out of the box. Setup was easy, it has prompts to connect to WIFI, etc., and it even lets you restore settings from another Fire TV if your prior TV was a Fire TV (which I did).\nPicture Quality: Really cannot complain here. I was able to adjust the picture and color settings to my liking, and the picture looks crisp with great color. There are so many different picture settings. Of course you will get varying degrees of quality based on how the content is broadcast (4k, UHD, HD, SD, etc.), but overall the picture quality is definitely much improved from my prior Insignia 58 inch Fire TV model from a few years ago. I turned on live sports and there is no stuttering/judder that I can see. The adaptive brightness seems to really help, especially with the display of colors vs. black as the black on my old Fire TV always looked more grey than black.\nAmbient Mode: A fantastic addition that I am sure I will enjoy more as time passes. This mode allows for artwork and/or widgets to be displayed on the TV all of the time when you are not watching it. It even gives you the choice of what types of artwork you want to display (such as Impressionist or Modernist) and what types of widgets (such as time, weather, or your calendar). You can ask Alexa to tell you about the artwork or simply click upwards on the remote and it will tell you the title and creator of the artwork. With how great the picture quality appears and how small of a border there is, it really does look like you have a painting on the wall. On par with the Samsung Frame at a fraction of the price. It is supposed to sense when you are in the room and turn off when you are out of the room, haven't tested that yet.\nBuilt In Alexa: A great feature that I didn't realize I was missing in my old Fire TV. I have plenty of Echo dots lying around the house that were able to connect to my prior TV, but I would have to turn around to speak at them and they never seems to control my TV very well. Having Alexa built in means I can speak right towards the TV and it can control all kinds of things like navigation programs, volume, turning the TV on/off, and telling your about the ambient artwork that is displayed.\nInternal Storage: This was a big issue for me with my last fire TV and it seems like it should be resolved with this one. My last Fire TV had less than 5GB of internal storage and it was always telling me that I was low on space and needed to delete apps. This TV has 11.32 GB of available internal storage, so more than double my last fire TV. Very happy about that.

Picture and sound are both good on the 50\u201d version that still has local dimming. Some infrequent blooming but overall another TV that proves less dimming zones isn\u2019t a detriment with proper processing. Peak brightness isn\u2019t as high as more expensive TV\u2019s but is still noticeable with HDR content and very acceptable at this price. HDR10, HDR10+, HLG and Dolby Vision IQ all work well with good brightness range and color volume. Note: no Dolby Atoms for sound. I knew this, my TV is wall mounted high and tilted down slightly in a small bedroom and I have no need for a sound bar. NOTE: if using a sound bar with an optical cable, try turning the TV speakers off AND changing the output to PCM or Dolby Digital; and use HDMI 4 (ARC/eARC).\nThis TV is a great value for my application and the budget I set for it.\nI\u2019m just using the Fire TV interface and none of the HDMI inputs. So I can\u2019t speak on Hue, Contrast and Color issues others may see. Out of the box, mine seems spot on and I currently have no want or desire to go in and adjust any settings based on the content from the various apps I\u2019ve used.\nThe interface isn\u2019t as fast as the Fire TV Cube 3 or Fire Stick 4K Max but still pretty good overall. Note to new Fire TV users: the interface is slower when updates are being downloaded and installed. Check the Device Info for updates several times when first starting the TV. There will be several updates: some very big ones and 2 to 3 more little ones at the least. Keep checking back until it says that it\u2019s \u201cup-to-date\u201d. THEN start to really enjoy the interface. Also the network connection and its QUALITY also plays a factor. This TV supports 2.4/5Ghz and wired (100Mbps).\nAmbient mode is great but just remember what the TV tells you. The power button on the remote TOGGLES between the Fire TV interface and ambient mode and that long pressing it turns the TV off. No issues with any widgets so far for me. Also, my TV easily recognizes when I enter and exit the room.\nIf you have other Amazon products nearby that listen for \u201cAlexa\u201d, simply change the TV\u2019s wake word to Computer, Amazon or Echo. Absolutely no issues with this.\n1. I haven\u2019t found any \u201cinescapable\u201d ads to get to content. You can \u201cclick\u201d on these shortcuts if you want but you can just user your voice to search for titles instead. Like every other TV interface or box, third party apps have their own interfaces, sign-ins, ads, etc. that can\u2019t be controlled by Amazon, Apple, Google, TCL, etc. Third party apps also place their own ads onto the TV platform they are on based on the deals they have in place.\n2. The Fire TV interface is anything but complex. You can set it up anyway you want. Again, the various interfaces, profiles, etc. of third party apps are completely independent from Fire TV and on the makers of them and this would be the same on any other TV platform.\n3. YMMV on the interface. Third party crashes and bugs are possible too. Third party interface issues need to be reported to their makers. They manage the various versions of their app across various platforms and sometimes they aren\u2019t all equal in performance or features offered by platform.\n4. It hasn\u2019t quite been a decade for Apple to allow the removal of 1st party apps (2016) but maybe Amazon will allow certain apps to be deleted one day. But understand these devices are meant to interface with and promote Amazon products and services primarily.\n5. The remote button press sounds can be turned off in options for the main interface. Don\u2019t know about the Alexa Home Theater mode but if there isn\u2019t a way, find out if there is one and if not ask that it be implemented.\n6. Again, out of the box settings being what they may for everyone, at least there are detailed picture settings available for the TV and all of its inputs \u2013 all independent of one another to get things looking the way you personally prefer.\n5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Fire TV for the price and features.

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2025Style: Wi-Fi 5 AC1200Verified PurchaseIncredible WiFi Range Extender \u2013 Perfect for Concrete Homes\nOur home is made of solid concrete, which has always been a challenge for WiFi coverage\u2014especially outdoors by the pool where we had no signal at all. This WiFi range extender has been a total game-changer. Setup was straightforward, with clear instructions and a quick connection process.\nSince installing it, the WiFi signal reaches all the way to the back pool area with strong, stable connectivity. Streaming videos, video calls, and even online gaming work smoothly without buffering or drops. The extender has noticeably improved the overall coverage inside the house too, filling in some dead zones we struggled with before.\nIt\u2019s compact, unobtrusive, and doesn\u2019t require complicated wiring. For anyone dealing with thick walls or large spaces, this extender is highly effective and reliable. Definitely recommend it for boosting your WiFi where it\u2019s needed most!\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2025Style: Wi-Fi 5 AC1200Verified PurchaseThis made a substantial difference in 5G signal strength and speed. Admittedly our router is older. We have to connect to a new ID, but that's not a problem. This was a cost-effective way to get better range. It is a small house and the demands on the network are not huge. More than enough bandwidth on speed tests.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2025Style: Wi-Fi 5 AC1200Verified PurchaseIt\u2019s good not gonna lie. It foes made a huge difference in the wifi connection and range, now my internet works 100 times better than before, the product is good, good quality and very easy to setup. Connectivity range is really great. Overall highly recommend.\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2025Style: Wi-Fi 5 AC1200Verified PurchaseI moved into a \"casita\" a few weeks ago - basically a small studio on someone else's property. WiFi is included in the rent, but it was a *very* weak & unstable connection in the casita & I've been STRUGGLING. I had to hold my laptop in certain spots to try to browse the internet or use my phone as a hotspot - which didn't last for long because even though I have unlimited data, it gets slower after a certain amount of usage & I had hit that wall & it wasn't going to get reset for another 2 weeks. I had to turn all of my streaming video quality settings to the lowest bit rate & it was still frustrating & unwatchable - stopping to load every few minutes.\nIn a nutshell, it was impossible to live with.\nI got this router because the reviews were all pretty encouraging & the price was really great compared to others, especially since I got it on sale for $20.\nIt arrived quicker than expected. I plugged it in & downloaded the app & crossed my fingers. I know it's supposed to be set up initially next to the router, but I was really hoping that I could catch enough signal to get it set up without bothering my landlords & going into their house.\nLong story short, IT WORKED!\nWhen I plugged it into the outlet in the bathroom, it got just enough signal to catch on & then I could plug it in anywhere & connect with a FULL WiFi signal!!\nI'm so so so happy. I tested it with streaming videos & music & everything & it is SOLID.\nIf you need to extend your WiFi in your house for any reason, do not hesitate to get this WiFi extender.\nUpdate:\nY'ALL I was connected to the house Wi-Fi in my car, parked out *on the street* where before I could barely connect at all 30 feet closer to it. That's amazing! Very *very* happy with this purchase!\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2025Style: Wi-Fi 5 AC1200Verified PurchaseI\u2019ve been using the TP-Link Wi-Fi Range Extender RE315 for a few months now, and I have to say \u2014 it\u2019s one of the best value networking upgrades I\u2019ve made.\nSetup was quick and painless \u2014 the TP-Link Tether app guided me through the entire process in under five minutes. I placed the RE315 about halfway between my router and the dead zone upstairs, and it instantly expanded my coverage. The smart signal indicator really helped find the sweet spot for maximum performance.\nPerformance-wise, it\u2019s rock solid. I\u2019m now getting consistent dual-band speeds (2.4GHz and 5GHz), with little to no drop in connection. Streaming 4K content, gaming on my Xbox, and handling Zoom calls \u2014 all work seamlessly in areas that used to be complete dead zones.\nOne of the underrated features is Access Point Mode. I plugged it into my wired Ethernet connection in the basement, and it created a whole new access point with fast, stable speeds \u2014 perfect for devices that don\u2019t handle weak Wi-Fi well.\nPros:\n\u2022 Super easy setup with the Tether app\n\u2022 Reliable and consistent connection\n\u2022 Dual-band speeds with good range\n\u2022 Built-in Ethernet port for wired connections or Access Point Mode\n\u2022 Compact design that doesn\u2019t hog outlets\nCons:\n\u2022 Not designed for gigabit speeds, but great for most households\n\u2022 5GHz range is a bit shorter (typical for dual-band devices)\nBottom line:\nIf you\u2019re struggling with weak spots in your home Wi-Fi coverage, the TP-Link RE315 is a fantastic, budget-friendly solution. It\u2019s easy to set up, reliable, and offers performance that punches well above its price tag.

For a speaker of its size, the sound is remarkably full and balanced. The crisp highs, clear mids, and punchy bass ensure an immersive listening experience, whether you\u2019re enjoying a podcast or a bass-heavy playlist. The speaker features Auto TruePlay technology, which adjusts the sound based on its surroundings, creating an optimal audio profile whether indoors or outdoors. This feature, in particular, sets the Roam 2 apart from many competitors, who often struggle with sound quality in varied environments.\nBattery Life\nOne of the most notable upgrades in the Sonos Roam 2 is its extended battery life. With up to 15 hours of playtime on a single charge, it offers a significant improvement over the original Roam\u2019s 10-hour lifespan. Additionally, the device supports wireless charging via Qi-compatible pads, as well as a USB-C cable for those who prefer traditional charging methods. This versatility ensures that you\u2019ll never be without your favorite tunes for long.\nSmart Features and Connectivity\nThe Sonos Roam 2 truly shines in its smart features. Built-in support for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant means that voice commands are just a call away. Setting alarms, controlling smart home devices, or queuing up playlists is seamless and hands-free. The speaker also supports Apple AirPlay 2, enabling easy streaming from iOS devices. Moreover, the ability to switch effortlessly between Wi-Fi at home and Bluetooth when on the move ensures a smooth and hassle-free experience.\nOne of the unique selling points of the Sonos Roam 2 is its integration within the broader Sonos ecosystem. Pair it with other Sonos speakers for synchronized, multi-room audio, or use it in stereo mode with a second Roam 2 for an enhanced auditory experience. This level of versatility is rare among portable speakers and makes the Roam 2 a valuable addition to any home audio setup.\nDrawbacks\nWhile the Sonos Roam 2 excels in many areas, it is not without its shortcomings. While the bass performance is impressive for its size, true bass aficionados might feel it falls short when compared to larger, more powerful speakers.\nConclusion\nThe Sonos Roam 2 is a stellar upgrade to an already impressive portable speaker.\nIn short, the Sonos Roam 2 is a compact powerhouse that doesn\u2019t compromise on quality, making it one of the best portable speakers available today.\n- Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2025Color: WhiteVerified PurchaseThe Sonos Roam 2 is hands-down one of the best portable speakers I\u2019ve ever owned. It packs incredible sound quality into a small, rugged design that\u2019s perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. Whether I\u2019m at home, hiking, or hanging by the pool, the Roam 2 delivers clear, balanced audio with impressive bass for its size.\nSetup was super easy\u2014just a few taps in the Sonos app, and it connected instantly via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The battery life is solid, lasting me all day on a single charge. Plus, the fast charging feature means less downtime between uses.\nI love the durability too: it\u2019s waterproof and dustproof, so I never have to worry about taking it outside or near water. The sleek design fits comfortably in my hand or bag, and the built-in voice assistant works well when I want hands-free control.\nOverall, the Sonos Roam 2 is the perfect blend of portability, ruggedness, and premium sound. It\u2019s great for anyone who wants high-quality audio on the go without compromising convenience or durability. Highly recommend!\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2025Color: WhiteVerified PurchaseI\u2019ve had Sonos speakers for many years. Was looking for a way to easily bring music outdoors without unplugging my indoor speakers, then I ran across the Roam 2. So I thought, why not give it a shot. That was a week ago, I\u2019ve since bought a second one to balance the music in the backyard. These are working so well I ordered a 3rd speaker for better backyard coverage. These were so easy to set up using the app, and only took couple minutes tops. Can group with other indoor speakers for music continuity in/out of the house. Only thing I would change, is the volume output. I have to nearly double the volume of outdoor speakers to match the volume.

Setup is a real pain... actually. What should've been straight forward , there were a lot of glitches getting this into the Sonos ecosystem. In general i find the \"initial setup\" for all sonos products to be rather inconsistent and frustrating. To note, i have 5 sonos speakers in my house -- every single one had had strange glitches and workarounds to get them initialized into my home sonos ecosystem. I bought TWO sonos roam2's in order to do stereo pairing. Both sonos roam2's during setup, had different problems. First one, it would not detect, factory reset twice... it finally worked. It was detected but then , ran into a weird glitch to \"add \" to the system. It timed out after some 5+ minutes..... i restarted the process again, and finally it worked. The second sonos, again, i had to factory reset once, then it wasnt able to find wifi this time. After going thru a couple more times it finally worked but then it ran into yet another problem where it would not \"finish registering\" (??) i had to do this around 10 times and finally it worked. I paired the speakers OK but after 15minutes, the pairing (as L / R stereo) decoupled again!!! I re-paired the two and linked them a second time... so far so good. knock on wood.\n2. it is a usbc connector for power .... it comes with the cable which is 1m. However it does not come with actual power supply!!! it requires a 3A plug which is like a modern apple or pixel ubsc charger. These will cost you extra --- i'm not sure why they didnt include one with the sonos --- > especially at the premium pricetag here.\nThe good?\n3. Sounds amazing for consumer use. While obviously not audiophile quality, for me they sounds fantastic . For such a tiny speaker, they fill the room with deep sounding bass thickness and very crisp highs. Theres a bit of the \"mid scooped\" sound but thats kind of expected for consumer type speakers. I'm happy that at least you can control the BASS/TREBLE EQ on the app. A \"loudness\" toggle is basically a must -- not sure why you'd turn that off. I wouldve appreciated a MID EQ too but i'm not gonna be too picky here as it sounds OK without. Pop / acoustic songs sound the best. Rock is muddy because of that mid-scooped sound but i think its a preference thing.\n4. After you \"pair\" two ROAM2's for stereo, the app assigns a L and R channel. I have this in the kitchen in two corners. It literally fills the kitchen with a really WIDE stereo image and it feels very immersive. Sounds actually amazing for a kitchen.\n5. Roam2's are so small, you can just grab one and take it on the go for bluetooth mode only. They pack a good charge so you need no plugs 8-10h of playtime (which is fantastic) -- They are hefty despite the size and i reckon most of that weight is due to the battery.\n6. Unlike older sonos, the newer ones including this roam2 supports 5ghz wifi which i'm so thankful for. 2.4 is too congested and my older sonos does not work well in 2.4 anymore so i had to wire it to ethernet. This one supports 5ghz and it is super reliable.\n7. I bought two white roam2's and they fit so nice in the corner because of the triangular form factor. You can barely notice its existence in the kitchen but once they start playing, the sound is HUGE for such a small pair.\nTo conclude, if your use case is like mine: Paired stereo 2x roam's discrete look in a room, this is a great solution that has built in amp, speakers and a highpowered chip (quad a53!!!) for excellent media streaming. Integrates perfectly with streaming apps like spotify. I'm super happy with it so far and so is my wife who finds these so easy to use in the kitchen and around the house.\n-\nJorge De la CruzReviewed in Mexico on July 28, 2025\n5.0 out of 5 stars Compacta, elegante y vers\u00e1til.\nColor: BlackVerified PurchaseEs una bocina un poco m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a de lo que parece.

El volumen es suficiente para una habitaci\u00f3n peque\u00f1a sin llegar a ser ensordecedora, finalmente y lo que importa es resaltar que la calidad del sonido es sobresaliente en distintos ambientes.\nEl precio puede disuadirte y entiendo que hay muchas opciones en este segmento; sin embargo, el respaldo de la marca y los accesorios disponibles hacen de esta bocina una de las m\u00e1s atractivas frente a su competencia.\n- Richard C.Reviewed in Canada on December 8, 2024\n5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Portable Addition to My Sonos Setup!\nColor: BlackVerified PurchaseI have a large Sonos setup spanning three floors of my townhouse, and despite the temporary app issues this summer, I remain a huge fan of the brand for their exceptional sound quality and seamless integration. When I decided to get a portable speaker for travel and garden use, the Sonos Roam 2 was the perfect choice\u2014it fits right into my existing system.\nAfter debating whether to get one or two for a stereo pair, I opted for just one, and I\u2019m not disappointed. The sound is incredible for its size, delivering crisp treble and impressively deep bass. The design is compact yet powerful, and it\u2019s a marvel of engineering.\nI also love the convenience features: the Roam 2 works with any standard wireless charger and can connect to whatever\u2019s playing in your location when you move rooms. It's perfect for extending your music experience seamlessly.\nBuying this during Black Friday made it an even better value, with the price being comparable to other high-quality portable speakers. For anyone already in the Sonos ecosystem\u2014or even looking for a standalone Bluetooth speaker\u2014you won\u2019t regret getting the Roam 2!\n-\nGuillermo S.Reviewed in Mexico on May 30, 2025\n5.0 out of 5 stars La bocina perfecta si existe!!\nColor: WhiteVerified PurchaseEstoy plenamente enamorado con el sonido que transmite esta bocina.

Did not seem to get too hot either. I will be buying more for myself and my wife. Great product.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2025I've been buying and using Anker products for over a decade now, and this was a \"for when I travel\" purchase so that I can charge my MacBook + iPhone/iPad/AirPods + Apple Watch all at once with one brick. It's small, but powerful enough to charge three items at once and fairly quickly. These bricks are solid and travel easily, and every time I buy myself a new Anker charger, it means I get to pass down my old one down to my dad. It's a win for all of us.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2025We bought this primarily for travel and travelling with fewer piugs for all our electronics including laptop. The Anker seemed to fit the fill and it was a two prong, which made it easier to get international adapters for, as well as worldwide voltage (without the need to buy a step-up/step-down transformer). WIth 2 usb-c and the standard usb-A, we would at least have our iphones charged quickly and a compatible port for other electronics.\nAnd the usb-c also charged our laptops, a macbook as well as windows PC (with a separately purchased 100W USB-c cable; I learned this the hard way - most iphone, android cables will NOT charge Usb-c laptops because they need more juice). Check, check and check (box).\nCharging is quite quick for phones, and we typically only charge with one of the Anker's ports-at-a-time, so maximum juice to charge quickly. We used this from Mexico to Japan to Italy (with plug adapter) - stellar performance.\nTook 1 star away because: it is long, sticking out of the wall and bulky/heavy. So it does drop out - hence the octopus-like sponge pad... which doesn't always stick. And forget about trying to use this on a underseat socket on the plane. The airplane vibration just wiggles out within seconds, faster with turbulence.\nSo, it is relegated for use on our global travels, table top sockets, extension cords (since hotel rooms hardly ever have wall plugs where you need them the most) and USA wall plates.\nOn planes, I found out that people use the underseat plugs so much that the plugs lose their prong-holding over time. Somewhere i read to use a EU round pin adapter-to-USA-plug and it might hold better - this does work, as I presume that the EU pins are used nearly as much. So I tried this and it worked about half the time, again falling out due to the weight.\nI would presume that the other shorter Anker Nano plugs which are cube-like would work better - but then, those are lower wattage, I would lose the ability to charge my laptops on the plane.\nI do like the Anker quality, completely trusting this plug internationally.\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2025Great value for money well constructed. It's a bit taller than regular chargers but the overall foot print is smaller it doesn't take a lot room on my Serge protector unlike most other chargers, it has two different port sizes, eliminating need for multiple chargers. And...it's super high speed. Just have to make sure your cable is compatible with ultra high speed\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2025This is a great charging block, it\u2019s very versatile, fast charges my iPhone 16 Pro Max and Apple Watch perfectly.

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2025Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseThe Beats Studio headphones present a compelling option, particularly when found at a discounted price.\nWhile their Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and sound quality offer only a marginal improvement over the AirPods Pro, their overall package truly shines in other areas. It's worth noting that sound quality does improve with lossless audio when connected via USB-C, but I've intentionally minimized this in my evaluation, as wired headphones fundamentally exist in a different category for me.\nComfort is a standout feature; they are exceptionally comfortable and snug, and their aesthetic is undeniably chic. The sound signature is notably balanced, and for closed-back ANC headphones, the soundstage is remarkably impressive \u2013 arguably their brightest shining attribute.\nBattery life is robust, and they boast rapid charging capabilities. Connectivity within my Apple ecosystem was seamless, quickly establishing them as my primary headphones for use with my work iMac.\nI acquired these at a significant discount, around $170 total, which was less than a new pair of AirPods Pro. At this price point, they represent an excellent value. You would be hard-pressed to find wireless, ANC-equipped over-ear headphones with this level of quality and such effortless Apple device integration for a comparable price.\nHowever, at their near-$350 retail price, better alternatives become available from brands like Sennheiser and Audio-Technica (including either wired and wireless options). Therefore, I strongly advise against paying close to full price for these headphones. Had I paid $300-$350, my rating would be closer to three stars. (On a related note, I consider the AirPods Max to be, at best, a one or two-star product at $550 \u2013 so, these Beats are undeniably the superior choice over the APMs). At their full retail price, these Beats simply aren't worth it, primarily due to the aforementioned sound quality and only marginal ANC improvement over the AirPods Pro.\nOverall, however, I am extremely happy with this purchase and believe I secured a genuinely great deal.

It's worth noting that sound quality does improve with lossless audio when connected via USB-C, but I've intentionally minimized this in my evaluation, as wired headphones fundamentally exist in a different category for me.\nComfort is a standout feature; they are exceptionally comfortable and snug, and their aesthetic is undeniably chic. The sound signature is notably balanced, and for closed-back ANC headphones, the soundstage is remarkably impressive \u2013 arguably their brightest shining attribute.\nBattery life is robust, and they boast rapid charging capabilities. Connectivity within my Apple ecosystem was seamless, quickly establishing them as my primary headphones for use with my work iMac.\nI acquired these at a significant discount, around $170 total, which was less than a new pair of AirPods Pro. At this price point, they represent an excellent value. You would be hard-pressed to find wireless, ANC-equipped over-ear headphones with this level of quality and such effortless Apple device integration for a comparable price.\nHowever, at their near-$350 retail price, better alternatives become available from brands like Sennheiser and Audio-Technica (including either wired and wireless options). Therefore, I strongly advise against paying close to full price for these headphones. Had I paid $300-$350, my rating would be closer to three stars.

Super comfortable on my ears\u2014I wore them for 6 hours a day, 3 days straight, and didn\u2019t feel any pressure or fatigue. The sound quality is excellent (and I\u2019m a bit of an audiophile), though I did notice something slightly off in the right ear. Can\u2019t quite pinpoint it, even after adjusting my Apple Music settings\u2014but it\u2019s subtle.\nThe microphone? Powerful. I was speaking softly (since I couldn\u2019t hear myself well with the noise isolation), and it still picked up everything crystal clear. The battery life is also impressive\u2014feels like it lasts forever. Overall, really happy with them\u2014just wish I could figure out that tiny sound imbalance.\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2025Color: DuneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseThe Beats Studio Pro Kim K edition is everything I hoped for and more. The neutral, minimalist color is absolutely stunning\u2014elegant and stylish without being over the top. It feels like a fashion accessory and high-performance headphones all in one.\nSound quality is phenomenal\u2014crisp highs, deep bass, and excellent noise cancellation. Whether I\u2019m working out, commuting, or just relaxing, the immersive audio makes everything sound amazing. They\u2019re also super comfortable for long wear, with soft ear cushions and a snug, secure fit.\nBattery life is great, and I love the seamless connection with my Apple devices. The attention to detail and the premium finish really set these apart.\nIf you want headphones that deliver both on style and sound, this Kim K collab is a total vibe. 10/10 recommend!\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2025Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseAbsolutely love! I compared these with a Bose pair and the Apple headphones and these ones came to be way more cheaper and overall so much better (battery life, Bluetooth, charging, product reviews). They are very minimal and so cute. The noise canceling is a dream, without even powering them on I can tell a difference.\nComfort- if your anything like me I hate earbuds because my ears are so small and they hurt them. These headphones are the squishiest and I\u2019m very pleased with the head band part and that comfort as well. I hate trying to rest my head on a plane or car and the plastic is hurting my head, I don\u2019t need to worry about that with these headphones.\nAnother thing I love on these is how simple it was to connect to them, literally all I had to do was power them on and they popped up on my phone to connect! I also appreciate how they look on my head while on, they don\u2019t pop out too much and are very easy to adjust to be loose or nice and snug.\nAbsolutely love!

I really like the oval ear shape and the soft, high-quality feel of the materials. They\u2019re super comfortable, and the rubber top band helps them stay in place without slipping.The media could not be loaded.\nThe pairing was quick and easy with the app, and I\u2019ve had no connection issues. Definitely a great alternative to other high-end brands.\nThe only downside is the carrying case\u2014it\u2019s well made but a bit snug, so taking the headphones out can be tricky. Still, an overall great buy.\n-\nCesareReviewed in Italy on January 27, 2025\n1.0 out of 5 stars deluso\nColor: Matte WhiteStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+Verified Purchasel\u2019ho prese per lo studio,adesso ho imparato la lezione,queste cuffie le compra chi non se ne intende,dopo una settimana in modalit\u00e0 isolamento si sente un fruscio,si sente lo scricchiolio della plastica,i bassi sono scarsi,durante le chiamate mi sentono male,dopo una breve ricerca ho capito che la qualit\u00e0 di queste cuffie \u00e8 pessima,non fate il mio errore,dr.dre ha venduto le beats a apple che le utilizza come seconda scelta,la produzione di queste cuffie non supera i $30,e dr dre \u00e8 stato il primo rapper a diventare miliardario,prima lo stimavo ora mi fa pena,grazie b\u2026h\n- MickeyReviewed in Canada on August 9, 2024\n5.0 out of 5 stars These headphones are amazing!\nColor: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseYou will never have a better quality sound than these beats but there's pros and cons in every product so i'll list them\nPROS\nPretty efficient, good sound quality, a pretty good noise cancellation and pretty good to fold them as you can transport them anywhere with the case. Really great for relaxing and travelling from afar, pretty great for a headphones you'll want to keep for a few years, pretty rough as i smash them on the ground while walking because i'm a clumsy ass but it didn't scratch a little bit\nCONS\nThey can be irritable to wear for a while, also the noise cancellation have a weird knocking noise on the left ear that can be annoying if you do focused tasks ( DO NOT WORRY, IT ONLY HAPPENED WHEN YOU NEAR AN INTERNET ROUTER, YOU CAN ALWAYS CANCEL IT BY TURNING DOWN THE NOISE CANCELLATION), Also, a lot of the time, i had to cancel my bluethooth near my phone so that my tablet will connect to it as it doesn't have an M1 ship, which can be able to be focused on one apple device or android device, also gym is not recommended as it falls after a deadlift\nOverall, i recommend them for travelling, relaxing or studying.\n- PbodReviewed in Canada on June 1, 2024\n5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent headphones\nColor: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseAfter reviewing several top end headphone brands I decided to try these Beats and I am very pleased with them.\nThey\u2019re comfortable and well made. Last a long time on each charge and can even charge from your iPhone via the usb-c cable whilst listening to lossless music or even Dolby Atmos music at the same time! They sound incredible with great bass and clarity. The different settings are great too for noise cancellation and surround sound (which actually works amazingly well!) or just having them set to normal sound works well.\nWind noise is the only downside I\u2019ve found but it\u2019s not a deal breaker. Using them to make phone calls is really good and the microphone picks up your voice very well indeed so calls a clear.\nThe way they fold up is very nice and the case is small enough not to take up much room at all and is excellent quality too. 5 stars!!\n- BrianReviewed in Canada on July 21, 2025\n4.0 out of 5 stars An ok product.\nColor: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseBought these on prime day. Always wanted a pair and at the price couldn't pass it up. They worked flawless for a 10 days and the left ear started having issues. It sounded like statics or wind blowing. When on noise canceling seting. Other then that love them. Tried all the trouble shooting didn't fix it. Read that a lot of people are having this issue. But amazon customer service was very helpful. With this problem."
