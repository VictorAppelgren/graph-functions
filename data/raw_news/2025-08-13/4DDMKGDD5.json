  "title": "Watching family VHS tapes is a lost art \u2013 but this retro iPhone app has brought it back for the smartphone generation, and I\u2019m hooked",
  "description": "A blast from the past",
  "content": "\u2022 The Cassette app is a retro-themed video player for iOS\n\u2022 It plays random videos from your past to help you rediscover old moments\n\u2022 It features retro styling, with a CRT video player and VHS tape boxes\n\nBack before digital videos and long before iPhones, people would capture videos on analog VHS cassette tapes. Video snippets would be captured in succession and bunched together on a single tape reel, meaning that when it came to watching back an old tape from years past, you never quite knew which clip was coming next.\n\nThat randomness and sense of discovery has been captured in a brand-new iOS app called Cassette, and it faithfully restores some of the fun of watching tapes on an old CRT TV. Whether you miss the old VHS days or never experienced them firsthand, it\u2019s an enjoyable distraction and a new way to view \u2013 and rediscover \u2013 videos stashed away on your phone.\n\nWhen you load up Cassette, you\u2019ll see a small CRT-style TV at the top of the app window, with a bunch of cassette tape boxes beneath. Each one is labeled for a year or a collection that you\u2019ve created in Apple\u2019s Photos app. Select a box and a tape will emerge from it and insert itself into the TV, which then plays the video.\n\nIf you want to see a larger version of the video, all you need to do is tap it. When this happens, you\u2019ll see it in full screen, with retro-style text noting the location, date and time of the video, all in a classic monospaced font. It\u2019s a real throwback moment for anyone who experienced footage like this in years gone by.\n\nA key aspect of Cassette is that the video selection is random. Tap a tape box and the app will pick a video from within that collection, and you can further lean into this idea by selecting the randomize button in the video player, or by pressing the Take Me Somewhere button, which loads a random video for your perusal.\n\nYou can pay ($0.99 a month, $5.99 a year, or $7.99 for a lifetime pass) to unlock the ability to choose which video plays, if you like. But that randomness is an intentional part of the app\u2019s offering.\n\nWriting in a blog post, Cassette\u2019s developer explained the motivation behind creating the app: \u201cRemember the magic days when we shot family events on a camcorder? Later when we put the VHS tape into the player, we\u2019d get a random stream of snapshots through time, a quick clip of a birthday here, a mountain there, then 10 minutes of a 5-year-old pulling faces and pretending to walk down imaginary stairs. Cassette steals a little bit of your free will to choose and replaces it with these forgotten videos, just like the good old days.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s about rediscovering old videos that you might not remember exist, just as watching a VHS tape surfaces clips from the past that would otherwise have been lost among all the others saved on a cassette sitting on a dusty shelf.\n\nThat all makes Cassette a fun little distraction. I\u2019ve given it a go and have been presented with old Call of Duty highlights, videos of friends\u2019 dogs misbehaving, timelapse shots of musicians in a recording studio, and much more. Without Cassette, these clips would likely have been lost to time among the thousands of others on my iPhone, never to see the light of day again. That makes Cassette an entertaining way to revisit the past, both in style and substance.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Forget 4K Blu-ray for Alien: Romulus \u2013 get it on VHS instead, physical media fans\n\u2022 UK Police wants to spend $100 million to turn millions of hours of VHS footage into digital format \u2014 now that's something AI could help with",

      "text": "I don't know which is more surprising; that Nintendo would randomly choose to update the CRT filter for its Nintendo Switch Online SNES game library, or that it would actually turn out to be good.\nIt's better than good, actually; it's shockingly brilliant. While nothing can quite replace the look and feel of a retro game on a proper CRT television, Nintendo's new solution is surprisingly accurate; complete with rounded display edges and a much greater sense of depth.\nUnconvinced this updated CRT filter would be any good, I loaded up the SNES library on my Nintendo Switch 2 and got to comparing some of its best games. The results have left me more than pleasantly surprised. To enable it yourself, simply access the SNES library from your Switch Home dashboard, and switch it on within the settings menu.\nDown the tubes\nCRT filters are nothing new. Retro game collections are more likely to have them than not. The problem is that they almost always miss the point; often just overlaying basic scanlines on top of the image and calling it a day. As a result, CRT filters often boil down to a cynical box on the nostalgia checklist to tick off, with no consideration as to how older 4:3 games may have actually looked on tube tellies.\nThe easiest example I can point to when it comes to how Nintendo has actually put in some time and effort here is with F-Zero's title screen.\nHere are a couple of images showcasing the image both with and without the new CRT filter:\nWithout the CRT filter, the image looks decidedly flat overall, with much sharper and jagged pixels.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWith it enabled, the edges of the display become rounded, accompanied by some very subtle vignetting to darken the corners of the image. The skybox in the background also appears more natural, almost completely eliminating the awkward dithering effect that draws attention to the contrast between pixels.\nHere's another example:\nOn the left, the ships and background layer are both a bit of a pixelated mess. But once again, the CRT filter is able to smooth these out, giving them a much more lived-in look.\nOne of the better examples of this heightened depth can be found in Donkey Kong Country. In the below images, notice how the game's pre-rendered visuals look a little soupy without the filter enabled - particularly with the foliage.\nWith it switched on, though, there's a greater sense of depth to the overall scene and a more careful balance between light and shadow. Also note how the skybox's gradient appears more convincing with the CRT filter enabled.\nWhy good CRT filters are important for older games\nTo many, this updated CRT filter might not be such a big deal. It is, after all, still down to personal preference and the games here do play just as well with or without the filter enabled.\nAs a lover of retro games, though, a quality CRT filter is everything. They can give you a very good approximation of how such games would've looked on an older 4:3 display. Not only that, but if you don't want to navigate the veritable minefield a retro gaming setup can require of you (including buying a CRT TV, consoles, games, controllers and cables), good filters like this can be the next best thing.\nYou might also like...\n- Nintendo Switch Online GameCube Classics: the good, the bad, and the games I\u2019d love to see\n- \u2018No other studio has made this kind of game before\u2019 \u2013 Where Winds Meet developers on building the ultimate free-to-play Chinese fantasy epic\n- Time travel, giant mechs, and \u2018limit breaks\u2019 - Warframe can\u2019t stop adding cool stuff, with big plans for the year ahead\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "Forget 4K Blu-ray for Alien: Romulus \u2013 get it on VHS instead, physical media fans\nIn space, nobody can hear you scream (when the tape gets mangled or the tracking slips)\nOne of the things I really love about Alien and its sequels is their distinctly low-tech take on high technology: this was a universe of interstellar travel, cryogenic freezing and other wonders run on 1970s computer tech with big clacky buttons and green-hued CRT displays, a design decision that was also carried across to the Alien Isolation video game.\nSo it's nice to see that Alien: Romulus is committed to the retro-futurist vibe too \u2013 so much so that it'll be released on \"fully functioning VHS tape\" in December with a 4:3 aspect ratio and a vintage-style sleeve.\nThe news comes via The Verge, which hasn't been able to confirm how many copies of the tape there will be or how much it's going to cost. It's clearly intended to be a collector's item rather than something you'll watch more than once, if at all.\nHow to watch Alien: Romulus if you don't buy the VHS\nThe age of the VHS officially ended in 2008 when JVC stopped making VHS players, but it went into steep decline in the 1990s when DVD and later, Blu-Ray came along. It's the format I watched the original Alien on, and Aliens too, so it's really nice to see Romulus going onto the format too.\nIf you'd prefer to watch the latest Alien movie with more current home theater tech, it's obviously going to look much better in its 4K UHD steelbook physical release on one of the best 4K Blu-ray players \u2013 this is due for released on 3 December 2024, along with the VHS version (and DVD and regular Blu-ray).\nIt'll also obviously look better on streaming \u2013 the date hasn't yet been announced for it to arrive on Hulu/Disney Plus, but late November or early December seems likely, possibly alongside the physical releases.\nBut it's not about what it looks best on, it's about what it looks most atmospheric on. What could be more atmospheric than starting this movie with the clunk of the video cassette player taking this movie in.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like\u2026\nContributor\nWriter, broadcaster, musician and kitchen gadget obsessive Carrie Marshall has been writing about tech since 1998, contributing sage advice and odd opinions to all kinds of magazines and websites as well as writing more than twenty books.

We've reviewed every iPhone released since 2007 (that's 46 models and counting), so we can confidently say that you don't necessarily need to buy the most expensive model to get the best experience with Apple's ubiquitous smartphones.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is, of course, the obvious choice for power users, but the standard iPhone 16 is a better option for those who prefer smaller phones. The iPhone 15, meanwhile, continues to rank as the best-value iPhone, while the newly announced iPhone 16e is the outright cheapest model.\nThe iPhone 17 series is tipped to land on September 9, so if you're in the market for a new iPhone, we'd suggest waiting until next month (if you can) before making a decision on which model to buy. Even if you're not fussed about owning the latest iPhone, the new line's arrival will likely drive the price of existing models down.\nBelow, we've selected the best iPhones for every use case, comparing key factors such as price, performance, cameras, and battery life to help you find a model that meets your needs. We've tested over 1,000 phones since 2005, so you can be confident that our recommendations are based on expert knowledge, in-depth analysis, and intelligent comparisons between devices.\nOnce you're set on a model, check out our best iPhone deals and Apple coupon codes pages for a roundup of the latest discounts. And for a look into the future, head to our iPhone 17 rumors hub.\nQuick list\nBest overall\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best Apple phone you can buy today. Its combination of an A18 Pro chipset, a great camera suite, and Apple Intelligence compatibility make it a potent flagship handset, though the smaller iPhone 16 Pro is equally impressive.\nRead more below\nBest for most people\nAll things considered, the iPhone 16 is the best all-round iPhone on the market right now thanks to its compact size, A18 chipset, excellent cameras, and future-proof software compatibility.\nRead more below\nBest value\nApple's base 2023 model may lack the bells and whistles of its newer stablemates, but the iPhone 15 is still fast, compact, and photographer-friendly. With USB-C connectivity and the Dynamic Island, it's a very complete iPhone for a compelling price.\nRead more below\nBest budget\nIf you're happy to forgo some niceties like the Dynamic Island and MagSafe, the iPhone 16e is an excellent iPhone entry-point thanks to its top-tier screen and powerful performance.\nRead more below\nBest battery life\nThe iPhone 16 Plus is the model to go for if battery life is your number one priority. The 16 Pro Max offers comparable endurance, but as a value proposition, the 16 Plus has it beat.\nRead more below\nI'm TechRadar's Phones Editor, and have been reviewing and writing about the best mobile devices (iPhones included) for several years. Based in the UK, I handle news and feature coverage for the phones section of the site, and regularly edit TechRadar's phones-related reviews and buying guides. You'll find my byline on over 1,500 TechRadar articles.\nThe best iPhone in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best iPhone overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want the very best iPhone money can buy right now, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is the model to go for. The iPhone 15 Pro Max was already (and still is) an exceptional handset, but Apple's latest flagship comes with a bigger screen, a more powerful chipset, a superior telephoto camera, a new Camera Control button, and Apple Intelligence compatibility.\nApple is pitching the latter of those features as the biggest selling point of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and while Apple Intelligence endured a rocky start to life, it's beginning to take shape, with more Apple Intelligence features on the way, too.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Pro chipset, which, according to our benchmark tests, is the most powerful chipset Apple has ever produced. In fact, the A18 Pro bested the results of all of the Android phone chipsets we tested in 2024, so the 16 Pro Max is a truly market-leading handset.\nAll that power makes scrolling, streaming, gaming, and productivity tasks a breeze on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, while the phone's gorgeous 6.8-inch Super XDR OLED display (with ProMotion) is the biggest and best iPhone screen, well, ever.\nOn the camera front, the iPhone 16 Pro Max boasts a 48MP quad-pixel main lens, a 48MP ultra-wide lens (the first on an iPhone), and a 12MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom (even more zoom would've been nice, but perhaps that's being greedy). Apple's new flagship also achieved a record-setting 16 hours of battery life in our testing, which is a figure rivaled only by the iPhone 16 Plus.\nIt's worth noting that the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro is exactly the same phone as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but smaller and cheaper. So, if you're not fussed about owning the biggest iPhone, we'd advise going for that model instead.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro Max review\nThe best iPhone for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're not fussed about the larger size, faster refresh rate, and telephoto camera capabilities of Apple's more expensive Pro models, the standard iPhone 16 is an excellent all-round iPhone that we consider to be the best iPhone for most people.\nThe iPhone 15 (below) is still our pick as the best-value iPhone given its cheaper price, but the iPhone 16's compatibility with Apple Intelligence means that it won't become outmoded as quickly as Apple's 2023 base model.\nOf course, the iPhone 16 brings more than just software upgrades. In addition to the Action button inherited from the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 16 gets an all-new Camera Control button, which can be used as a traditional shutter button or as a capacitive button that lets you zoom and adjust exposure, as well as a superfast A18 chipset, a larger battery and a faster 45W charging speed than the iPhone 15.\nThe iPhone 16's 48MP wide and 12MP ultra-wide cameras are impressive, but if you want truly exceptional zoom capabilities, you're better off going for the iPhone 16 Pro (or indeed the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra or Pixel 9 Pro).\nAs for the iPhone 16's display, you'll get a stunning 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED screen that we found offers punchy colors and stark contrast points, though as alluded to above, you'll have to go for the pricier iPhone 16 Pro to benefit from Apple's ProMotion (i.e. 120Hz refresh rate) technology. For a spec-by-spec comparison of the two models, check out our iPhone 16 vs iPhone 16 Pro explainer.\nRead our full iPhone 16 review\nThe best value iPhone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDespite the arrival of the iPhone 16 series, we still consider the standard iPhone 15 to be the best-value iPhone in 2025. What it lacks in titanium sides, 120Hz scrolling, or high-spec zoom photography, the standard iPhone 15 more than makes up for in performance and portability.\nFor just $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,249 from Apple directly, you get a 6.1-inch Super XDR OLED display, a fast A16 Bionic chipset, a USB-C port, a supremely capable 48MP main camera, and Apple\u2019s smart digital screen cut-out, the Dynamic Island, all delivered in a sleek and eye-catching design package.\nYou do lose out on Apple Intelligence compatibility with the iPhone 15, so if you're ready to embrace smartphone AI and want a future-proof pocket companion, the iPhone 16 is the better buy. However, if you're simply looking for a speedy, long-lasting, and eye-catching iPhone to see you through the next three or four years, the iPhone 15 is an excellent choice.\nFor a spec-by-spec comparison of the two models, check out our iPhone 16 vs iPhone 15 explainer.\nRead our full iPhone 15 review\nThe best budget iPhone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFollowing the launch of the iPhone 16e in February 2025, Apple discontinued both the iPhone SE (2022) and the iPhone 14, meaning the company's new entry-level iPhone 16 model is now the cheapest iPhone available as new.\nThe iPhone 16e brings several key upgrades over the iPhone SE (2022), including a 48MP main camera, a more powerful chipset, a longer-lasting battery, and Apple Intelligence compatibility. You'll have to make do with a physical notch instead of the Dynamic Island, and there's no MagSafe compatibility to speak of here, but the iPhone 16e is, after all, intended to be a no-frills model.\nIf you're looking for more bells and whistles, go for an iPhone 15 or an iPhone 16 (to see how the iPhone 16e stacks up against those more expensive models, check out our iPhone 16e vs iPhone 15 and iPhone 16e vs iPhone 16 comparisons), but put simply, this is the best budget iPhone available in 2025.\nRead our full iPhone 16e review\nThe best iPhone for battery life\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe iPhone 16 Plus takes everything great about the standard iPhone 16 and supersizes it, meaning this is the handset to go for if you prefer a larger iPhone but don't want to spend big on the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nThis year's model gets all the same benefits as the standard iPhone 16 \u2013 the Action button, the Camera Control button, Apple Intelligence compatibility, and so on \u2013 but the Plus also benefits from battery life that pretty much wipes the floor with its comparatively priced competition.\nIn our testing, the iPhone 16 Plus lasted a whopping 16 hours and 29 minutes; that's endurance to rival the iPhone 16 Pro Max. So, if battery life is your number one priority, we'd recommend going for this phone over the iPhone 16 Pro Max and saving yourself $300 / \u00a3300 / AU$550 (if you don't care about ProMotion, that is).\nRead our full iPhone 16 Plus review\nFAQs\nWhat is the best iPhone?\nThe best iPhone is usually one of the latest numbered models, but the value of each will depend on your specific needs. If you want a big screen, go for a Pro Max (the latest and greatest is the iPhone 16 Pro Max). For top specs in a smaller size, pick a Pro, and if you want to save some money, then get a standard model or the iPhone 16e.\nWhich iPhone is the best value for money?\nRight now, the iPhone that offers the best value for money is the iPhone 15, although the iPhone 16 is the more money-savvy choice if you're keen to use Apple Intelligence features. The iPhone 16e, meanwhile, is the outright cheapest iPhone, so go for that if you're simply looking for the most inexpensive option.\nHow to choose the best iPhone?\nA lot of iPhones are quite similar to one another, so choosing which model to buy mostly just means seeing what's different between them and finding the right fit for you.\nAll iPhones are powerful, and Apple supports them for a long time, so age and chipset needn't be a big deal, but if you don't plan on upgrading for a long time, then a newer model with a faster chipset is ideal.\nBigger factors, though, include the screen size \u2013 and bigger isn't always better. If you want something compact that you can easily slip into a small pocket, then consider Apple's 6.1-inch models. But if you plan on doing a lot of gaming or video-watching, something larger would be better.\nResolution and refresh rate are also worth paying attention to for the optimal visual experience \u2013 the higher the better in both cases, so ideal options will have things like a 120Hz refresh rate and a resolution above 1080p.\nCamera quality and battery life are important considerations, too, and you can't get a full picture of these just from a specs list, so read our full entries above (or click through to our detailed reviews) for insights into how each iPhone fares in those departments.\nHow we test\nWe've reviewed every iPhone on this list, meaning for each, we've passed our expert judgment on them after extensive testing. These reviews saw us use each phone as our main handset for at least a week, and often longer.\nIn the process, we would explore various use cases, including calls, texts, social media, video streaming, gaming, taking photos, and more, with some heavy use days and other lighter ones.\nIn short, we use our iPhones just like you would \u2013 but we make sure to test every key feature, as well as run benchmark tests, checking how long they take to charge, and more.\nUsing that data, we've then ranked each handset, factoring in price, value, and how they compare to one another, with a particular focus on their screens, designs, battery life, performance, and cameras.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

      "text": "I\u2019m no movie director, but this app helped me create a movie of my life\nHomescreen Heroes: 1 Second Everyday is a video diary app with some innovative features\nHave you ever seen one of those videos that is a compilation of one-second videos that document a person\u2019s life? The first one that I ever saw was incredibly memorable because it was of a person who had taken a photo every single day for ten years. It showed how they had changed from a 14-year-old boy into a 24-year-old man, and I found it surprisingly moving.\nAs well as selfie shots, these types of videos can also be comprised of favorite memories with friends, while at work, or those holidays that you don\u2019t want to forget about. The mix of mundane and memorable can often make for a more accurate recounting of a person\u2019s life.\nEvery time I\u2019ve watched one of these videos, I\u2019ve thought, \u201cI really should do the same,\u201d but for various reasons, I\u2019ve never actually followed through with it. I wonder if I\u2019d be disciplined enough or sufficiently committed to the cause to make it happen. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d start strong, but I doubt I\u2019d see it through.\nThis is part of a regular series of articles exploring the apps that we couldn't live without. Read them all here.\nThen I came across an app called One Second (1SE), which is a dedicated app that helps you manage your daily memories so you can focus solely on capturing the required content. I thought this could be just the app I needed to finally make the movie of my life. With that in mind, I put on my imaginary director\u2019s hat, downloaded the app, and cracked on with my life\u2019s movie.\nPicking and choosing memories\nThe first thing I realized was that I didn\u2019t want to wait years to create a movie of my life. I\u2019m not one of those people who feel like they need everything in life served up instantly, but I was certainly not in the mood to wait longer than I had to. That\u2019s why I was glad to discover the Smart Fill feature, which automatically adds bulk selections of photos and videos to the correct dates in your timeline.\nI knew this would still require a process of manually going through my back catalog of photos, but being able to bulk select photos would be a lot quicker than adding a photo or video for each day.\nUnfortunately, 1SE only lets you access on-device media and therefore won\u2019t let you select from a cloud-based repository such as Google Photos. As someone who has decades worth of photos stored in the cloud, this meant I had to go through the frustratingly laborious process of transferring media from Google Photos onto my iPhone. If 1SE could add Google Photos integration, then that would be infinitely easier, but for now, you should be prepared for this step.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nCreating memory videos is a total breeze\nAnyway, with that first hurdle cleared, I was ready to create a specific memory video. The 1SE app provides suggestions that let users automatically create videos of specific months, years, or seasons, or you can manually select the snippets you want to include. I love an easy life, so I picked the \u2018month\u2019 preset.\nFrom there, you can adjust the speed, overlay some licensed music from the library, adjust the video orientation, apply filters, and more. All of these features are seamlessly integrated into the app, easy to use, and surprisingly useful for creating a customized video.\nWith all the edits and settings nailed down, the last step involves exporting the video in either HD quality (1080p) or standard quality (720p). The choice will be determined by where you\u2019re planning to post or store the resulting video, although I think users should choose the best quality every time. This will not only produce better results but will also help your video stand the test of time.\nWith the video exported, you\u2019re then free to share your creations with the waiting world, whether that be with family or friends on WhatsApp or on YouTube for the public to see.\nGet 1SE Pro and direct like a pro\nThe core 1SE app is free to use, but if you\u2019d like access to its premium features or are keen to support the growing development team, then you should consider upgrading to 1SE Pro.\nThe main difference between free and pro is that there are no limits to the number of projects or snippets you can create. Any memories you upload are securely backed up, and 1SE branding is removed from the end of videos. I also love that you gain the ability to access a library of licensed music for adding soundtracks to creations.\nIf you\u2019re serious about creating memory videos, either for yourself or for a friend or family member, then you\u2019ll want to upgrade to Pro. You can do this for $4.99/\u00a39.99 per month or $49.99/\u00a349.99 per year.\nBut first, why not give the free version a go by downloading the app on Apple or Android.\nPaul is a digital expert.

      "text": "I tried the modern boombox design that mixes cassettes with Bluetooth \u2013 and it was like slipping back into my favorite pair of shoes\nIt's the ritual, not just the sound\nThe Great Cassette Rewind continues, as more affordable tape-playing options capitalize on the love for collectible physical media, which has only grown in the wake of the vinyl revival.\nEarlier in 2025, We Are Rewind announced a metal Walkman-like portable player that can play cassettes over Bluetooth or with the best wired headphones, and then followed it up with the We Are Rewind GB-001 boombox reinvention.\nAnd yes, this goes all out at being a boombox just the way you remember it. It's got a front-opening cassette deck, it's got physical dials and buttons, it's got a folding handle, it's got twin VU meters on the front, it's got two-way speakers on each side, and it's slightly heavier than is really convenient.\nThere are two notable feature swaps from the boombox you had a few decades ago, though: the radio tuner is out and Bluetooth is in for wireless playback, and the battery is a built-in rechargeable option instead of needing a dozen cells each the size of a large hamster.\nIt's got a guitar/mic input if you want to play or sing along with the music, and you can use this input to record to the cassette deck. Sadly, you can't record to tape from the Bluetooth connection, and I wish it actually had two cassette decks so you could go really old school and record between them, but what's here is probably the right balance for using it in the real world.\nSpeaking of which, I did get to test it out, though in a slightly odd situation: I was at a big audio trade show, and we couldn't test it in the side room it was being shown off in, because there was a constant demo of much larger speakers.\nSo we just took it out into the public area, put it on the ground, and turned up the dial until I could enjoy my music and everyone around me was annoyed \u2013 the authentic public boombox experience!\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nActually, I suspect that people were more curious than annoyed \u2013 they were at an audio trade show, after all, and this thing really stood out among all the more traditional hi-fi that dominated the show.\nThere is a deep, fundamental satisfaction that comes from turning up the volume and seeing physical VU meter needles start to jump higher and higher up their range; a reassuring supplement to what your ears are telling you, that rocking is about to happen.\nDespite being at a hi-fi show, the GB-001's sound is not exactly audiophile, which will not be a shock to anyone \u2013 and is not what we really want from it anyway. Because I was listening to it on a noisy trade-show floor, obviously my assessment of its sound is very much limited, but it is at least representative of using the thing in the real world, where other sounds around you will conflict with it.\nIt's heavy through the low-end, which is common among outdoor speakers, because bass is easily lost when traveling through open air. It seems to know what it's doing with this bass, which felt fairly controlled and lively \u2013 the risk with going strong on bass is that it starts to become flat and lands with a thud, but this felt like it had bounce.\nThe mids felt a little lost among the sound around me even when I'd turned the volume pretty high, but the treble comes across, and again I feel like this is what you expect from this kind of speaker in this environment \u2013 all the movement and conversation around me is heavily in the mid-range and is most likely to overwhelm the audio, but I could still hear all the core essence of songs, and definitely the beat.\nI couldn't tell you much about its delivery of detail in that environment, but I genuinely do feel like this asking the wrong question of a boombox.\nOne thing to note is that it delivers a notably broader sound over Bluetooth than it does from cassettes. It's one big reason why I don't think the tape revolution will ever take off in the same way as the vinyl revival. I know some people love them, but really cassettes were the best solution to a portability problem at the time, and basically every solution since then has been superior.\nBut there is a genuine charm to them outside of the sound, which is the same with vinyl. The physical ritual of opening a box, sliding out the cassette, and sliding it into the boombox's caddy is deliberate and satisfying.\nThe chunk of pressing the mechanical buttons tickles the right part of the brain. The click and silence of a successful rewind delivers anticipation that you're about to dig into something good.\nAnd I've written about this before, but I genuinely miss the creativity of the mixtape era, and both of We Are Rewind's products have that in mind, both including a line-in option to record something personal to tape and share it with your crush/best fried, or sibling, or favorite artist you waited ages at the stage door to see who's definitely going to love your stuff and will be your big break.\nEven with all that acknowledged, it's the light-up twin VU meters that are my favorite part of the whole thing. They're another element that adds anticipation; when the lights come on and the needle twitches, you're about to kick off a good time.\nMy next home hi-fi upgrade will be genuinely influenced by the presence of features like this, because now that it's possible to play all the music in the world in high quality with almost no equipment whatsoever (just some of the best earbuds and your phone), if you're going to invest in big physical units to provide pleasing playback, they should make you as happy physically as they do sonically.\nI think the GB-001 gets this \u2013 it's about the ritual of music, at home or out at the skate park.\nYou might also like\u2026\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, meaning he's in charge of persuading our team of writers and reviewers to watch the latest TV shows and movies on gorgeous TVs and listen to fantastic speakers and headphones.

      "text": "Today I launched Cassette, a new app that I\u2019ve been noodling on for a little while. In short Cassette is a fun way to watch your home videos shot on iPhone.\nNow Your first thought might be \u201cCan\u2019t I already do that in the Photos app?\u201d\nTo which I might reply \u201cWell\u2026 yes, but this is different, I think\u2026 I hope. Remember the magic days when we shot family events on a camcorder? later when we put the VHS tape into the player, we\u2019d get a random stream of snapshots through time, a quick clip of a birthday here, a mountain there, then 10 minutes of a 5 year old pulling faces and pretending to walk down imaginary stairs. When you watch videos in the Photos app, it\u2019s typical to hunt out a specific clip that you remember, watch it and then move on. Which means there are hundreds, nay thousands of forgotten videos, robbed of the serendipity of being rediscovered. Cassette steals a little bit of your free will to choose and replaces it with these forgotten videos, just like the good old days\u201d\nThen maybe we\u2019d stare at each other for a moment, blink and part ways. Later in the evening you might download the app, reject the Photos access permission prompt and go to sleep. I lie awake all night wondering how on earth I read your mind.\nAll of that to say, if you shoot a lot of video on your phone, I\u2019d love for you to check it out. This app certainly isn\u2019t the next big thing, it\u2019s just a little thing, made with love.\nI recommend starting with the a handy \u201cTake Me Somewhere\u201d button if you\u2019re not sure where to start. If you want the full kick back experience then you can mirror your phone with AirPlay to your TV and enjoy your videos as Cassette seamlessly play through them all.\nDownload Cassette here"

The second lot allows for outsourcing, with suppliers collecting or receiving tapes for off-site conversion. The third lot focuses on niche formats such as microfiche, DVDs, and CDs.\nAltogether, the work is valued at up to \u00a3120 million including VAT. The largest share, \u00a360 million, will be assigned to in-house conversion efforts. Outsourcing services may reach \u00a330 million, with niche media making up the remainder. Suppliers will be able to bid for one, two, or all three lots.\nBluelight Commercial says suppliers must be able to deliver outputs ready for ingestion into digital evidence systems. That includes attaching the right metadata and ensuring secure handling of sensitive material.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nThe procurement tender is open to small and medium-sized businesses as well as voluntary or community-focused providers.\nWhile the framework allows for direct awards, police forces can also run mini-competitions to decide which service or supplier offers the best value for their needs.\nThe open nature of the framework means there's no cap on the number of suppliers who can be involved.\nAlthough VHS became obsolete years ago, archives of the format are still widely used in law enforcement.\nThis isn\u2019t like converting a few home movies with a USB capture device. Police records need to be preserved with accurate metadata, stored in secure formats, and integrated into evidence systems that meet legal standards.\nThe scale also matters, with millions of hours needing consistent processing, file management, and long-term digital preservation.\nAI-assisted tools could help speed up parts of the process, especially when tagging, compressing, or sorting large volumes of footage. But the core task - playing physical tapes and converting their analog signal into digital files - still depends on specialized hardware and real-time playback. AI can only go to work after that step is completed.\nVia The Register\nYou might also like\nWayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

Not really \u2013 you\u2019ll get much crisper, smoother and easier to share footage from a mid-range smartphone. But that\u2019s missing the point entirely. This is a simple, affordable retro-styled camcorder that\u2019s big on the more subjective aspects of videography \u2013 stuff like fun, vibes and living in the moment. If you can work around \u2013 or even better, wholeheartedly embrace \u2013 its quirks and limitations, you\u2019ll find it a welcome breath of fresh air in an increasingly spec-chasing marketplace.\nPros\n- +\nSuper stripped-back operation\n- +\nLong battery life\n- +\nEasily expandable storage\nCons\n- -\nSuper stripped-back operation\n- -\nViewfinder hard to use for glasses wearers\n- -\nTrigger noise audible in clips\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nCamp Snap CS-8 review: two-minute review\nReleased back in 2023, the original Camp Snap camera has quickly established itself as a minor cult classic. While I wouldn\u2019t call it one of the best compact cameras around, this ultra-affordable, ultra-simple and ultra-pocketable screen-free snapper is a refreshing return to photography\u2019s old-school principles: just point, shoot and look at the results at some point in the future.\nNow, with the new Camp Snap CS-8, the company has brought that same ethos to video. Styled after the Super 8 film cameras of the 1960s, complete with vintage textured plastic, pistol-grip operation, knurled dials and analogue meters to show remaining battery life and storage space, the CS-8 is a retro camcorder for a generation bored of using smartphones for all their video needs.\nThe CS-8 is large and chunky, and felt reassuringly weighty in my hand. I\u2019m not in love with the abundance of plastic here \u2013 despite the classic looks, there\u2019s very little of the metal you\u2019d find in a genuine original Super 8 camera \u2013 but I get it.\nThis is an ultra-affordable modern simulacrum of a vintage camera rather than the painstaking recreation provided by Kodak\u2019s own 2024-released Super 8 (price tag: north of $5,000), and it\u2019s awash with obvious fakery: there are imitation screws on the base of the handle, a dummy cold shoe on top and, despite the rubbery grip wrapped around its barrel, there\u2019s no way to actually adjust the lens. I can live with all that, as I don\u2019t expect it to be a \u201creal\u201d 8mm camera \u2013 just to look like one from a distance.\nDistractions are minimal; with no screen and an electronic viewfinder designed only for shot composition, there\u2019s no way to review (or even delete) your footage until you offload it to a computer. There are very few settings to fiddle with, either: one dial picks your preferred aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9, 1:1 or 9:16), one your film look (standard, B&W, analogue or one of two vintage filters) and\u2026 that\u2019s it, basically.\nWhen the CS-8 is powered on, the rubber-cupped viewfinder shows a live view, formatted to match the current aspect ratio, plus the amount of battery life remaining and the current film look. To record a video, you simply point the camera at a subject and squeeze the trigger \u2013 there\u2019s no need to focus, although you can use the \u201cW\u201d and \u201cT\u201d buttons to zoom in and out. Just like on a real 8mm camera, you need to keep the trigger pulled the entire time you\u2019re filming; releasing it stops the capture immediately.\nWhile reviewing the CS-8, I realised that it makes filming a much more conscious act than when I\u2019m using my phone, or even a compact camera. Because there\u2019s no screen and no pressure to immediately check on the footage after it\u2019s been recorded, I can concentrate on recording a clip, and then move on. There\u2019s no need to fret about what I\u2019ve recorded until I get home, or until the SD card is full (which takes a while, as there\u2019s enough space here to hold about 30 minutes of video \u2013 and by loosening two screws and pulling off a panel, you can replace the supplied 4GB card with one up to 128GB in capacity, giving you room enough for around 16 hours of video).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe footage itself is quite high-resolution, but not high-quality. There\u2019s no stabilization, using the digital zoom degrades detail quickly and sound is monoaural. This suits the camera perfectly, I think; in fact, my favorite look by far is the Super 8-mimicking Analogue, which reduces the frame rate to 20fps (it\u2019s 30fps on all the other modes) and adds fake scratches and artefacts to the image. The resulting imperfect, jerky video is charmingly odd, while the other modes are a little flat and boring.\nIf I want pristine, stabilized video, I\u2019ll use my iPhone or a mirrorless camera. What I want from the CS-8 is something different, weird and striking \u2013 and with the Analogue setting, at least, I\u2019m getting just that. It\u2019s not \u201cgood\u201d video, no, but good video is not the point.\nI also think the camera is ideal for kids, being incredibly simple to operate, robustly built and cheap enough that it doesn\u2019t matter too much if it gets damaged. In my experience, youngsters weaned on smartphone photography expect to be able to look at what they\u2019ve just filmed right away \u2013 and might find the idea of waiting hours or even days to see their footage utterly baffling. Maybe the CS-8 could be a perfect way to teach them a bit of good old-fashioned patience?\nI don\u2019t like everything about the camera, though. The microphone picks up the noise of the trigger being pulled in almost every shot, which is one bit of jankiness I found far less charming than the rest. The viewfinder is also a real pain to use if, like me, you wear glasses; even pressed right up against the cup I could only see about half of it, which I found annoying when trying to compose shots or even scope out remaining battery life.\nStill, I view the Camp Snap CS-8 more as a fun alternative to a smartphone than a camcorder I\u2019d use every day. It\u2019s great for holidays, road trips, parties and the like \u2013 pass it round and let everyone have a turn filming, then edit all the clips together when you get home and share the results. As a piece of cheap, nostalgia-fuelled fun, it\u2019s hard to beat.\nCamp Snap CS-8: price and availability\nAt the time of writing, the CS-8 is currently available for pre-order, with shipments due to go out \u201cby mid-September\u201d 2025.\nThe camera is priced at $199 / \u00a3152, but those who do order ahead of the launch date can take advantage of 25% introductory discount, making the price a very reasonable $149 / \u00a3114.\nIn the box you get the camera itself, a pre-installed 4GB microSD card and a USB-C to USB-C cable for charging and data transfer. It would have been nice to include a strap or lanyard, but you either buy Camp Snap\u2019s own wrist strap/USB-C cable or add any strap of your own.\nCamp Snap CS-8 review: specs\nVideo | Up to 2880 x 2144 30fps |\nAudio | Mono only |\nAperture | f/2.0 |\nZoom | 8x digital |\nFocus | 0.3m-infinity |\nStorage | 4GB microSD card (replaceable) |\nStills | N/A |\nConnectivity | USB-C |\nBattery life | 30 minutes (approx.) |\nDimensions | 200 x 58 x 203mm / 7.9 x 2.3 x 8in (approx.) |\nWeight | 519g / 18.5oz |\nShould I buy the Camp Snap CS-8?\nBuy it if...\nYou want an ultra-simple video camera\nAbout as point-and-shoot as video gets, these days \u2013 and there\u2019s no even a screen to distract you from the act of filming.\nYou\u2019re a fiend for nostalgia\nIf you\u2019re on your fourth binge-watch of Mad Men, the CS-8\u2019s 1960s flair and its vintage video look might well appeal to your mid-century aesthetic sensibilities.\nYou want a kid-friendly camcorder\nCheap, sturdy and simple to use, the CS-8 is ideal for young kids. As long as they don't mind waiting to review their footage.\nDon\u2019t buy it if\u2026\nYou\u2019re expecting pristine audiovisual quality\nWith tinny sound and grainy video, the CS-8\u2019s home movie clips are much more 1960s than 2020s. That\u2019s kind of what you\u2019re paying for, really \u2013 but inveterate pixel peepers need not apply.\nYou\u2019re a spectacles wearer\nIf your glasses are, like mine, as thick as bottle bottoms, you might struggle with the CS-8\u2019s restrictive viewfinder. It\u2019s not a deal-breaker for me, but it is an annoying design quirk.\nYou want pocket-sized portability\nThe CS-8 is a very chunky camera by today's standards, and isn't fitting in anything but the largest of coat pockets.\nHow I tested the Camp Snap CS-8\n- Three weeks of regular use\n- Filmed video using all settings and looks\n- Edited videos together using DaVinci Resolve\nI was sent an early, pre-release review sample of the CS-8 from the initial batch of models off the production line, and had plenty of time to live with and test the camera in a variety of real-world scenarios: family get-togethers, coastal walks and inside my home, both day and night.\nThe camera is light on options, but I tested all the aspect ratios and looks (or filters), before exporting the video files to my laptop and editing them together into the sample video you see above using DaVinci Resolve. I didn\u2019t color grade, correct or adjust any of the files, though \u2013 just used the editor to trim and stitch them together.\nSam has been writing about tech and digital culture for over 20 years, starting off in video games journalism before branching out into the wonderful worlds of consumer electronics, streaming entertainment and photography.

      "text": "Hate the new iOS 18 Photos app? Try these fixes to make it more like the old version\nHidden customizations are your friend\nThe launch of iOS 18 has been mostly well-received by iPhone fans, but the most controversial change has been Apple's redesign of the Photos app.\nAcross the TechRadar office and multiple Reddit threads, many fans have been fuming about the many changes \u2013 with the most disliked one being Apple's decision to ditch the tabbed navigation bar that used to live at the base of the app's screen.\nInstead, Apple has embraced a scrolling design that, for many, makes the app feel slower and more laborious to use. Fortunately, it has also hidden two handy customizations that can help you restore the app to something similar to the previous tab experience.\nThe first is the ability to change the order of the app's long list of photo collections. To do that, scroll to the bottom of the app and tap 'Customize & Reorder'. This lets you move your preferred collections, such as 'Albums' and 'Recent Days, ' further up the page.\nIf you want something closer to the old navigation bar, the key one to move to the top (so it sits just below your Photos feed when you open the app) is 'Pinned Collections.'\nAs the name suggests, this is a bar of shortcuts to your preferred photo sets. To change the order of these, tap 'Modify,' and you can move some of the old nav bar favorites, like 'Albums,' into one-tap territory again without needing to scroll.\nIf your photo feed is overrun with screenshots, you can also remove them and restrict them to a Screenshots folder in Pinned Collections. To do this, scroll upwards on the Photos app's home screen until the menu bar appears at the bottom of the screen. Now tap the up-down arrows button, hit 'View Options,' and then uncheck Screenshots.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWhile you may still need to relearn some muscle memory, these tweaks should at least make the Photos app less confusing and overwhelming than it first appears.\nRIP nav bar\nIt's fair to say that the new Photos app has traded some old-school simplicity for a more modern look, and that's divided opinion. However, the undoubted plus side is that this approach comes with greater customization.\nThese options are somewhat buried or hidden in the UI \u2013 so while many have been dismayed and aghast upon opening the new Photos app, there are, fortunately, ways to restore a more familiar experience.\nThat's not to say there aren't legitimate grievances with Apple's new app. One is that video playback appears to have taken a step backwards, with the scrub bar losing its thumbnail previews and requiring a tap to play videos full screen. Another is that the app feels slightly cluttered, with so many automated collections competing for your attention \u2013 although you can again remove the ones you don't want using the 'Customize and Reorder' menu.\nWhile some iPhone owners are holding off from updating to iOS 18 in order to keep their comfortably familiar Photos app, they may soon be tempted to take the plunge when Apple Intelligence features finally start rolling out \u2013 which Apple confirmed today will happen next month in the US, and in December for the UK and Australia.\nYou might also like...\nMark is TechRadar's Senior news editor.

  "argos_summary": "The Cassette app for iOS is a retro-themed video player that allows users to rediscover old videos from their past, mimicking the randomness of watching VHS tapes on a CRT TV. It features a nostalgic interface with cassette tape boxes and a CRT-style player, encouraging users to experience forgotten moments through random video playback. Users can opt for a subscription to unlock additional features, but the app's charm lies in its intentional randomness, reminiscent of the joy of unexpected clips from family events.",
