  "content": "SINGAPUR, 21 ago (Reuters) - El d\u00f3lar estadounidense bajaba el jueves mientras los inversores esperaban las se\u00f1ales de pol\u00edtica monetaria del simposio de Jackson Hole de la Reserva Federal, sin perder de vista la preocupaci\u00f3n sobre la independencia del banco central tras la \u00faltima intervenci\u00f3n del presidente Donald Trump.\n\n* Las divisas tuvieron una reacci\u00f3n tibia al anuncio de que Estados Unidos y la Uni\u00f3n Europea cerraron el acuerdo comercial marco que alcanzaron el mes pasado y que incluye un arancel estadounidense del 15% a la mayor\u00eda de las importaciones de la UE.\n\n* El euro y la libra esterlina cotizaban estables en 1,1649 d\u00f3lares y 1,3460 d\u00f3lares, respectivamente. El yen japon\u00e9s bajaba un 0,3%, a 147,85 yenes por d\u00f3lar, mientras que el franco suizo tambi\u00e9n sufr\u00eda ligeras p\u00e9rdidas.\n\n* La probabilidad de que la Reserva Federal recorte las tasas de inter\u00e9s el mes que viene se reduc\u00edan ligeramente, al 79%, lo que ofreci\u00f3 un ligero apoyo al d\u00f3lar, ya que la atenci\u00f3n se centraba en la posici\u00f3n del presidente de la Reserva Federal, Jerome Powell.\n\n* Probablemente habr\u00e1 una reacci\u00f3n mayor si Powell indica que la Fed podr\u00eda mantener las tasas de inter\u00e9s estables de nuevo en septiembre, que si se inclina en la direcci\u00f3n de un recorte, dijo Kenneth Broux, jefe de investigaci\u00f3n corporativa de divisas y tasas de Societe Generale.\n\n* \"Los riesgos son asim\u00e9tricos. Dado que (un recorte) ya est\u00e1 descontado, el riesgo es que volvamos al 50-50\", agreg\u00f3.\n\n* La reacci\u00f3n a esto ser\u00eda una venta masiva de bonos del Tesoro de Estados Unidos de corto plazo y un d\u00f3lar m\u00e1s fuerte, dijo Broux.\n\n* La petici\u00f3n del presidente Trump de que la gobernadora de la Fed, Lisa Cook, dimita por las acusaciones vertidas por uno de sus aliados pol\u00edticos ha reavivado la preocupaci\u00f3n de los inversores sobre los esfuerzos de este por ganar influencia sobre el banco central.\n\n* El \u00edndice del d\u00f3lar , que mide la divisa estadounidense frente a otros seis pares, cotizaba estable en 98,337 y se encaminaba a una subida del 0,4% esta semana.",

  "translation": "Singapore, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The US dollar went down on Thursday while investors waited for the monetary policy signals of the Jackson Hole symposium of the Federal Reserve, without losing sight of the concern about the independence of the Central Bank after the last intervention of President Donald Trump.\n\n* The currencies had a warm reaction to the announcement that the United States and the European Union closed the framework agreement that they reached last month and that includes an American tariff of 15% to most EU imports.\n\n* The euro and the sterling pound traded stable at $ 1,1649 and $ 1,3460, respectively. The Japanese yen down 0.3%, to 147.85 yen per dollar, while the Swiss Franco also suffered slight losses.\n\n* The probability that the Federal Reserve cut the interest rates next month were reduced slightly, to 79%, which offered a slight support to the dollar, since the attention focused on the position of the president of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell.\n\n* There will probably be a larger reaction if Powell indicates that the Fed could maintain stable interest rates again in September, that if it is inclined in the direction of a cut, said Kenneth Boux, head of corporate research of currencies and rates of Societe Generale.\n\n* \"The risks are asymmetric. Since (a cut) is already discounted, the risk is that we return to 50-50,\" he added.\n\n* The reaction to this would be a massive sale of the United States Treasury bonds and a stronger dollar, Boux said.\n\n* President Trump's request that the governor of the Fed, Lisa Cook, resigns for the accusations expressed by one of her political allies has revived investors' concern about her efforts to gain influence on the Central Bank.\n\n* The dollar index, which measures the American currency compared to six pairs, traded stable at 98,337 and was aimed at a 0.4% rise this week.",

      "text": "The Trust Principles\nThomson Reuters is dedicated to upholding the Trust Principles and to preserving its independence, integrity, and freedom from bias in the gathering and dissemination of information and news.\nTrust Principles \u2013 the history\nThe Trust Principles were created in 1941, in the midst of World War II, in agreement with The Newspaper Proprietors Association Limited and The Press Association Limited (being the Reuters shareholders at that time). The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations. The charter documents of Thomson Reuters Corporation include provisions to safeguard the Trust Principles as they apply to the Thomson Reuters business and require Thomson Reuters Directors, in the performance of their duties, to have due regard to the Trust Principles, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their other duties as Directors.\nThe Trust Principles are:\n- That Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction;\n- That the integrity, independence, and freedom from bias of Thomson Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved;\n- That Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media subscribers and to businesses, governments, institutions, individuals, and others with whom Reuters has or may have contracts;\n- That Thomson Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in addition to those of the media; and\n- That no effort shall be spared to expand, develop, and adapt the news and other services and products of Thomson Reuters so as to maintain its leading position in the international news and information business\nThomson Reuters Founders Share Company was established in 1984 when Reuters became a public company. The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management. Through Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company's Chairman, regular contact is maintained with our company. The relationship is one of trust and confidence.\nIndependence of Thomson Reuters\nCustomers across the world depend on us to provide them with reliable and objective news and information.\nThis means that we have a special need to safeguard our independence and integrity and avoid any bias which may stem from control by specific individuals or interests.\nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles were adopted in 1941 and include the preservation of integrity, reliability of news, development of the news business, and related principles.\nToday, the Trust Principles are fundamental to our entire business.\nMore information\nContact us\nBrian Moss\nFor inquiries pertaining to Reuters reporting standards and the Trust Principles please email: brian.moss@thomsonreuters.com."

The dollar\u2019s decline was offset by a modest 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, keeping the euro and pound largely unchanged, and the yen fell 0.3%. Expectations for an upcoming Fed rate cut fell slightly to 79%, and analysts warned that a dovish Powell stance could trigger a sharp Treasury sell\u2011off and a stronger dollar.",
