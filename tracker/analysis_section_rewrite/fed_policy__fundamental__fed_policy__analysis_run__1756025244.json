      "feedback": "Solid multi‑year framing and first‑principles anchors are you main strength, but push this to world‑class by formalizing a regime‑based, quantified narrative and tightening the sourcing and transmission logic. Suggestions in one compact paragraph of edit steps:\n\n- Explicit regime framework: replace the open‑ended base case with a three‑regime structure (Regime A: policy easing with inflation cooling; Regime B: policy neutral to modest tightening on sustained inflation; Regime C: hawkish surprise/late tightening). Tie each regime to concrete triggers and transition conditions (e.g., Regime shift if CPI/Y/Y% inflation, wage growth, or unemployment move outside defined bands for 2–3 consecutive data prints; if Jackson Hole signals hawkish or dovish posture, etc.). Attach rough probability weights and a map of transition risks. This satisfies the horizon requirement and makes regime dynamics tractable.\n\n- Ground transmission in concrete numbers and channels: quantify the pricing impulse from policy to assets (discount rates, dollar, equities) using anchor numbers from sources: 10‑year yield around 4.20–4.25% in the MEA/Bloomberg tapes, and the Jackson Hole/Sept data backdrop; include Bessent’s call for a substantial easing (roughly 150–175 bp total lower from current levels) as a trigger for weaker dollar and higher equity multiples; cite Tencent AI spend growth (~150% in Q2) and its monetization/marginal‑revenue implications; and incorporate BoJ/yield/yen dynamics (yen around 146.5 vs dollar) as a cross‑asset channel. Present a crisp causal chain: policy path/real rate differentials -> discount rates and currency moves -> equity earnings and valuations (AI‑driven growth) -> risk premia and money flows.\n\n- Strengthen AI/tech earnings linkage with discipline: quantify the earnings/valuation channel from AI monetization (e.g., Tencent’s ad monetization gains and broader AI integration effects) and contrast with potential policy/FX headwinds; avoid generic statements by anchoring to the cited growth signals and the cross‑asset reactions (e.g., yields, dollar, crypto/gold moves around Jackson Hole week).\n\n- Define catalysts and invalidation tests: list clear triggers and failure modes (e.g., CPI surprise > consensus by X basis points for two consecutive prints; wage growth reaccelerates; Powell shifts to hawkish messaging; a major tariff/ sanctions surprise). Predefine what would invalidate the base case (e.g., sustained inflation above target for 6–8 quarters or a 50–75 bp shock to real rates via policy path).\n\n- Reconcile conflicts and strengthen citations: explicitly acknowledge tensions (e.g., Bessent’s calls vs. Jackson Hole signals) and assign relative weights; consolidate citations so every major claim rests on one or more IDs (GX057ADL7, 37UZC9X8I, H7Q52FKDH, C3ODMIQKZ where relevant) and avoid over‑relying on peripheral pieces like the Donegal/Benzinga note; ensure every critical source inform the base case, regime triggers, and the to‑watch list.\n\n- Structure for clarity and format: deliver as a crisp base case plus upside/downside branches, a single “what to watch” list, a concise confidence assessment, and explicit numbers (as above) tied to each channel; trim nonessential material and integrate the cross‑asset/geo cues (BoJ/yen, Jackson Hole, Tencent, OQ dynamics) into the core chain rather than as side notes. This will meet the horizon/style focus and produce a cohesive, testable framework rather than a sequence of observations.",
