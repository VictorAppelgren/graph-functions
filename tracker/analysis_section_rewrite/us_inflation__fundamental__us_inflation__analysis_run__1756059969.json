      "feedback": "Strengths: you anchor a multi‑year, structural horizon with the automation/UBI tension from NL5YYTLF2 and thread it through market signals (Ford, UNH, Lulu) via 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, and IGP1Q4ZEJ, then deepen the retirement-cost backdrop with YVQU6QCY4 and related GoBankingRates pieces; you also attempt to translate a causal chain into a base case and risks. Concrete upgrades to world‑class quality follow.\n\nActionable edits (tight, first‑principles, scenario‑driven): 1) formalize invariant anchors and regime definitions at the top (e.g., productivity growth from AI as an endogenous driver; policy reaction function credibility; labor‑supply elasticities; and a baseline real rate/inflation backdrop implied by the sources). State regime conditions explicitly (Regime A: credible retraining/targeted supports; Regime B: fiscal‑policy stress leads to broad UBI or shallow retraining; Regime C: policy missteps increase labor‑force withdrawal) and map the causal chain from automation exposure (25% of US jobs high risk per Brookings‑style framing) to identity loss, mental‑health costs, labor‑force participation, and then to demand, investment and asset pricing. 2) convert the narrative into a crisp, 5‑part causal chain with timelines and thresholds (automation exposure → occupational identity erosion → health/demographic costs and labor‑force margin compression → consumption/investment dynamics → policy response/market pricing), citing NL5YYTLF2 where the linkages appear. 3) deliver a formal base case plus clearly labeled upside/downside scenarios with explicit triggers (e.g., if UBI is adopted with modest coverage and design changes, employment impact remains limited; if policy credibility falters or EV capital spend compresses consumer durables, cyclicals spike). 4) deepen quantification by pulling precise numbers from the sources you cite in the narrative: 25% high‑exposure/36 million (NL5), Finland UBI trial results, Great Resignation context; Ford metrics (17% YTD gain; 4.3% operating margin; $1.3B EV loss; 5.18% dividend; forward P/E ~10); UNH/LULU specifics from IGP1Q4ZEJ; retirement anchors (Morningstar 3.7% safe withdrawal, $2,002/mo Social Security, 15% savings target in YVQU6QCY4/9/15 family), and use them to bound ranges rather than assertions. 5) expand coverage of critical sources beyond the two retirement pieces you cite by incorporating 11, 16, 12, 14 and 16‑type items where relevant, so you reconcile potential conflicts (e.g., UBI vs retraining evidence, retail investor behavior around Ford vs high‑quality cash yields). 6) tighten the prose into a single cohesive macro‑frame paragraph that preserves the cited IDs but eliminates speculative tone; clearly label base case, risks, what to watch (policy credibility signals, AI adoption tempo, auto/durables demand, retirement‑cost indicators) and assign a confidence level grounded in regime‑credibility and the dispersion of scenarios. 7) ensure every assertion about a non‑obvious causal link has a source or is clearly framed as a plausible channel with caveats; fix any overgeneralizations (e.g., treat the “portfolio bets” as illustrative rather than as a universal market impulse). 8) finish with a concise, quantified base case and a short, explicit risk checklist (policy missteps, EV cycle shock, healthcare inflation) so readers can gauge sensitivity. 9) keep the format tight to SECTION FOCUS: multi‑year horizon, first‑principles anchors, regime/transition conditions, base case, risks, what to watch, and a clear confidence statement, all tied to the IDs NL5YYTLF2, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, IGP1Q4ZEJ, YVQU6QCY4, and the retirement/strategy articles (9, 15, and others as you add). 10) in the final render, maintain the constraint of using only IDs present in SOURCE MATERIAL and ensure the citations cluster logically to support each link in the causal chain.",
