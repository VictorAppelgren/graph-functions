  "description": "Alyson Stoner shares harrowing accounts of stalkers, attempted kidnapping and fame's dark side in the new tell-all book, \"Semi-Well-Adjusted Despite Literally Everything.\"",
  "content": "As a teen actress, starring in a hit Disney movie introduced Alyson Stoner to the darker side of fame.\n\nThe entertainer had been performing since age 3. The 32-year-old danced alongside Missy Elliott and appeared in \"Cheaper by the Dozen\" and \"Camp Rock,\" among other films. Now, Stoner is detailing the dangers of Hollywood stardom in a new memoir, \"Semi-Well-Adjusted Despite Literally Everything.\"\n\n\"Camp Rock\" debuted on the Disney Channel in 2008 to 8.9 million viewers, resulting in a rabid fandom that the castmates weren\u2019t anticipating. It made Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers household names. And at 15, Stoner, their co-star, suddenly became the target of stalkers and an attempted kidnapping.\n\nFORMER DISNEY CHILD STAR WOKE UP TO 'ZERO DOLLARS' IN BANK ACCOUNT AFTER NEARLY 20 YEARS IN SHOWBIZ\n\n\"My team vetted a request from an international organization dedicated to fulfilling end-of-life wishes for terminally ill children,\" the now 32-year-old wrote. \"I hopped on a virtual call and met Emily, a superfan of \u2018Camp Rock.\u2019 Mom corresponded with their reps, who asked for travel information to book a flight for an in-person visit. After claiming I needed to travel alone, my mom\u2019s intuition sounded an alarm.\"\n\n\"Though my team approved the request, my mom did her own due diligence and discovered the website was a scam, the young girl was a plant, and I was walking into a kidnapping plot to be held hostage for ransom,\" Stoner revealed.\n\nMonths later, the star received 50 messages on Twitter from a middle-aged stalker who was convinced that \"I \u2013 as a teen \u2013 was his wife, named Cinderella, with whom he shared pet mice.\"\n\nAccording to the book, the obsessive fan\u2019s numerous messages alternated \"between praise and harmful threats.\" Then one day, he implied that he would show up to YouthArts, where Stoner volunteered weekly as an instructor.\n\nThe man's IP was traced to Kansas. But just in case, Stoner provided a photo to the front desk, warning staff to be on the lookout.\n\nThen one day, Stoner spotted him. He entered through the back, and was holding flowers and fuzzy purple house slippers. Students ranging from ages six to 12 were in the building unaware that anything was unfolding.\n\n\"I made a thousand calculations in a split second,\" Stoner wrote. \"There are no exits besides that doorway. I have vulnerable children under my care, and I can\u2019t scare them. I [needed] to get to the front desk to call the cops. I don\u2019t know what mental state he\u2019s in. I can\u2019t provoke him.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nA panicked Stoner rushed to the front desk. Police were called, and they chased the man for about a mile. But he was gone.\n\nStoner, who goes by they/them pronouns, claimed that the police informed them that the man \"has to physically lay a hand on you before we can do much.\"\n\n\"But he said he would \u2018end me\u2019 if I didn\u2019t wear my hair in a bun in the way he liked\u2026 So I have to die, and then you can help?\" Stoner wrote.\n\nAccording to the book, the stalker appeared later wearing \"an army green shirt\" - a completely different ensemble. Stoner managed to get help from a parent to escape. Still, Stoner claimed that a studio manager labeled them \"paranoid.\"\n\nWATCH: FORMER DISNEY STARS EXPLAIN HOW CHILD STARDOM PREPARED THEM FOR \u2018SPECIAL FORCES\u2019\n\n\"Without a budget for a bodyguard, I became an expert at studying body language and herd behavior, noting traits and tendencies among people so I could anticipate interactions,\" wrote Stoner.\n\n\"Middle-aged men were typically dads of Disney-loving children, Missy Elliott or Steve Martin fans, or creeps. By the time they approached, I\u2019d already clocked how long they\u2019d been staring, whether they were lone wolves, and if their hands were visible or hidden in pockets.\"\n\nThis was just one of several frightening experiences that marked Stoner\u2019s adolescence while being in the spotlight.\n\nStoner described how someone gave out their number, which resulted in receiving nearly 900 text messages from strangers. Many asked for money. Others fired \"really nasty messages\" that sent their \"already paper-thin trust to the shredder.\"\n\nWhenever Stoner went out in public, they had to devise plans to get to and from destinations to avoid being followed. But some managed to track Stoner\u2019s locations, and one even discovered their flight itinerary. Love letters appeared outside hotel rooms, each one leaving Stoner uneasy. They also began questioning the motives of friends. Heading to dinner at a restaurant always meant slipping in and out in secret.\n\nStoner grew up in Toledo, Ohio, and was scouted by the same woman who discovered hometown celebrity Katie Holmes. As a child, Stoner and their mother moved to Los Angeles to pursue a Hollywood career. By age 12, Stoner was poised to star in their own show until another teen sitcom \u2013 \"Hannah Montana\" - was picked up. And by their mid-teens, Stoner was struggling with an eating disorder. They sought treatment at age 17.\n\nLater in the book, Stoner also claimed they were sexually assaulted by a potential business partner. The alleged assailant attended wellness events and was \"well-adored in the community.\"\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\n\"The last image I saw was a poster on the wall of a ravenous feline leaping for its prey,\" Stoner recalled in the book. \"Then I blacked out, and he raped me.\"\n\nStoner recently recalled to Fox News Digital how, after working in showbiz for nearly 20 years, they woke up to \"zero dollars\" in the bank account. There should have been over a million.\n\n\"Even though I was absolutely frugal, and I continue to be, there are a lot of loopholes that leave room for a child\u2019s money to be mishandled, even by people who have good intentions but don\u2019t understand the unique business structures of entertainment expenses,\" Stoner explained.\n\n\"It was shocking to wake up to zero dollars in an account,\" Stoner admitted. \"I was mostly in denial at first. I was afraid for my future. I wondered after all this time, if I can be duped once, will I be taken advantage of again? Do I have the competence, the life skills to find my way outside the industry?\"\n\nThe entertainer was in their early 20s when they made the shocking discovery.\n\nStoner and their older sister teamed up to investigate years of records, the book details. The duo discovered that Stoner\u2019s business team had mismanaged finances, splurging on lavish gifts. Their mother, a \"career bookkeeper,\" had been paying herself a monthly salary since Stoner was a child, plus taking \"one-off payments\" of \"several thousand\" over the years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThere were also decades of hefty expenses to maintain a successful career in Hollywood. There were never any conversations about budgeting and saving.\n\nStoner wrote that 15 years of labor turned into \"a crumbling house of cards.\"\n\n\"A lot of folks are unaware that it can cost between $10,000 and $20,000 for different expenses,\" said Stoner. \"Many artists are losing money while spending a lot of time and energy and resources auditioning, only to be rejected a majority of the time\u2026 The creative industry is largely unpaid labor. When you\u2019re a child, the assumption is that you can afford to do this for fun, because you aren\u2019t necessarily the breadwinner.\"\n\nA devastated Stoner met with an entertainment lawyer. Ultimately, they decided against legal action, writing that they \"can\u2019t burn a bridge with my mother.\" Stoner said they felt loyalty and compassion for the matriarch, who had also struggled with alcohol. Fox News Digital reached out to Stoner\u2019s mother for comment.\n\n\"I began performing at the age of 3,\" Stoner reflected. \"I attended a performance convention in New York at age 6. Unbeknownst to me, this was a recruitment funnel for Hollywood. And my Midwestern family had zero affiliation with the industry.\"\n\n\"I had zero aspirations to pursue the industry,\" said Stoner. \"And yet, there was a funnel with lots of different players, from agents to managers, to casting directors, who were used to seeing children go through this process almost like a conveyor belt, becoming packaged products for audiences.\"\n\n\u201880S STAR KELLY LEBROCK \u2018RAN AWAY\u2019 FROM HOLLYWOOD FOR GOATS, GRANDKIDS AND SIMPLER LIFE\n\n\"At 6 years old, I couldn't understand the short- and long-term implications of\u2026 having corporations own my name, image and likeness,\" Stoner continued. \"It was also impossible for my family, who were given no upfront manual for what to expect, to recognize the consequences of disrupting every area of my childhood development, removing me from school to navigate 80-hour work weeks.\"\n\nToday, Stoner is the founder of Movement Genius, an online platform that aims to make mental health support more accessible. Stoner is also a voice actor for Disney.\n\nStoner noted that being an advocate for the next generation of child performers is one of their most important roles today.\n\n\"My memoir gives people an opportunity to learn about the intimate details of what happened on all those sets growing up, while also answering very timely questions about what it means to navigate the world,\" said Stoner. \"I tell people, \u2018Come for the childhood chaos. Stay for the cultural critique.\u2019\"",

Stoner claimed that at age 17, they convinced a \"world-renowned medical weight-loss camp\" to help, with the goal of building muscle for the film, not shedding pounds.

Stoner is also a voice actor for Disney.\n\"I strongly encourage people to pursue local community theater first,\" Stoner offered up when asked about advice for parents. \"For a young person to be able to develop healthfully, they need developmentally appropriate experiences.

      "text": "'80s star Kelly LeBrock is reflecting on why she abruptly left Hollywood at the height of her fame.\nThe 65-year-old actress launched her modeling career when she was 16 and later rose to stardom with leading roles in 1984\u2019s \"The Woman in Red\" and 1985\u2019s \"Weird Science.\" In 1987, LeBrock married action star Steven Seagal, with whom she later co-starred in the 1990 hit \"Hard to Kill.\" The former couple welcomed three children before their highly publicized divorce in 1996.\nFollowing their split, LeBrock quit the entertainment industry and moved to a ranch near Santa Barbara, California, where she raised her children. During a recent interview with Fox News Digital, LeBrock recalled her decision to flee the spotlight for a simpler life.\n\"I ran away. I didn't step away,\" LeBrock clarified. \"I ran away.\"\nShe continued, \"I was never impressed with myself or Hollywood. I never really cared about it. And I did the right thing.\"\n\"You know, I could always go back to a career, but I couldn't go back to my children,\" Lebrock added. \"And that was the most important thing to me was raising my children, because I grew up in boarding school. At five [years old], I was sent away. And I didn't want to have that story for my children.\"\nThe New York native, who was also raised in London, and Seagal are parents to daughter Annaliza, 38, son Dominic, 35, and daughter Arissa, 32. While speaking with Fox News Digital, LeBrock shared an update on her children's lives now. She noted that Annaliza works as a deputy sheriff in Siskiyou County, which is located in the northwestern part of California. Lebrock said that Dominic is currently in Russia, where he is \"just starting a film production.\"\n\"And I have my lovely youngest daughter who can do whatever she likes,\" LeBrock said of Arissa, with whom she co-starred in the 2017 Lifetime reality show \"Growing Up Supermodel.\"\nIn addition to modeling and acting, Arissa has pursued a career in professional wrestling.\n\"She's brilliant at everything,\" Lebrock added. So I'm proud of them. I have three wonderful grandchildren.\"\nMeanwhile, LeBrock said she has continued to enjoy her quiet life on her ranch in rural Southern California.\n\"I have a bevy of animals, which is what I was doing,\" she said. \"I was taking care of the chickens and the sheep and the goats and the horses and the dogs and the cats.\"\n\"So, I really ran away,\" LeBrock said. \"I mean, the hardest thing for me is not putting on makeup or trying to look nice. It's trying to get those chin hairs out of my chin. And it's a whole new world. What can I say? But I'm excited about my future. I'm developing a Kelly Care product, which is going to help people with their wounds for their pets and grooming. And I'm excited about that, but not interested in Hollywood.\"\nWhile LeBrock noted that it was her divorce from Seagal that prompted her exit from Hollywood, she explained that she really never felt comfortable in the industry.\n\"The crowd is very ugly, and I didn't want any part of that,\" she said. \"I'm really quite shy, and I'm a homebody. I spent the two years of COVID completely by myself, pretty much in the wilderness. And you learn a lot about yourself when you're not in the noise.\"\n\"And yeah, life's good now,\" LeBrock added.\nLeBrock was one of the industry's top models in the 1970s before embarking on her acting career. Shortly after her star-making turn in \"Weird Science,\" LeBrock became the face of a beauty campaign for the Pantene haircare line and famously appeared in a shampoo commercial in which she delivered the now-iconic line \"Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.\"\nIn a 2012 interview with Allure magazine, LeBrock recalled that she was initially uncomfortable with saying the line and almost left the audition.\n\"I used to be so insecure and self-conscious that if anybody even looked at me, I'd go red,\" LeBrock told the outlet. \"So even though it was obviously tongue-in-cheek, it was really difficult to say, 'Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.'\"\nDuring her interview with Fox News Digital, LeBrock explained that she has gained more confidence as she has aged.\n\"I never thought I was beautiful,\" she shared. \"I feel more beautiful now than I did then. And that's sad. Youth is wasted on the young, that's for sure.\"\nLooking back, LeBrock said that adjusting to her life in \"the wilderness\" wasn't that difficult.\n\"I grew up in a very isolated area, the five, six years of my life, playing in fields and unattended by parents,\" she recalled. \"And that saved my soul. I think when you can be in nature and be without people, then you get to know yourself, and you're comfortable.\"\nHowever, LeBrock explained that ranch life was not without its perils.\n\"There's mountain lions and big rattlesnakes and tarantulas and bears, but the lions are big,\" she said. \"And the last time I saw one, I ran home on my horse, and I haven't been down to that area since, because they're pretty big.\"\nLeBrock told Fox News Digital that she was disheartened by today's culture, which she noted was more disconnected from nature. She pointed out how technology's increasingly dominant role in daily life has limited human interaction.\n\"I'm really sad for our society,\" she said. \"You go into an airport, you go into a restaurant, nobody's talking. They're all on their phones. It's like a sickness. It's like a drug. And I don't want any part of that. It's just confusing to me.\"\nDespite permanently moving away from Hollywood, LeBrock has made occasional forays back into her former profession.\nOver the years, she has made appearances in movies, most recently taking on the role of Donna, a grieving mother and former gangster's ex-wife, in the 2021 comedy \"Tomorrow's Today.\" She has also competed on reality shows, including \"Celebrity Fit Club\" and \"Hell's Kitchen.\"\nThis year, LeBrock and her \"Weird Science\" co-stars are celebrating the movie's 40th anniversary.\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\nDirected by John Hughes, the Frankenstein-inspired science fiction comedy followed nerdy teenage best friends Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) and Gary (Anthony Michael Hall), who create their dream girl with the help of a computer.\nLeBrock played their dream girl named Lisa, who possesses the looks of a model, the intelligence of Albert Einstein, the fashion sense of David Lee Roth, along with superpowers including teleportation and time manipulation.\nThe actress remembered feeling some trepidation after she arrived on set for the first time.\n\"It was only my second film, and it had been filming for six weeks,\" she said. \"So to be sort of unknown to go into a film that's been filming that long with a tribe of people who were all very interwoven, they already were good actors and everything \u2014 that was a bit frightening. It was like the first day at boarding school.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\"And John Hughes was such a child and just an amazing human being,\" she added. \"And yeah, the cast of characters speak for themselves.\"\nLeBrock told Fox News Digital that she never imagined \"Weird Science\" would become so iconic.\n\"You never think about when you're doing something, what's gonna happen,\" she said. \"You just wanna do a good job and go home. No, you never know. And then sometimes you think something's gonna be great, and it falls flat on its butt. So yeah, chance is a fine thing.\"\nRobert Downey Jr. also played a minor role in the movie. LeBrock recalled that the \"Iron Man\" star was a \"complete character\" on set.\n\"We never knew how big he was going to be and to have such a small role in an iconic film was interesting to watch how he grew and how he saved his life basically by getting straight,\" she said. \"That's a cool story.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhile speaking with Fox News Digital, LeBrock reflected on why the film continues to resonate with audiences today.\n\"Because we had fun in those days,\" she explained. \"There weren't all these complications that are here today. People actually looked like how they looked. It was just a fun, easygoing period in life.\"\n\"Where if we had cameras and smartphones in those days, we'd all be arrested,\" LeBrock added."
