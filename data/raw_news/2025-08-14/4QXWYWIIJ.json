  "description": "Need tabloid-size output in the office, or truly big photo prints at home? These top-rated wide-format printers handily produce documents and photos on paper that's 11 by 17 inches or larger\u2014in some cases, much larger.",
  "content": "Most people never print on anything bigger than letter- and legal-size pages, so most printers only handle paper up to 8.5 inches wide. For larger stock, however, a universe of wide-format printers is out there\u2014from desktop models to floor-standing behemoths that print to giant paper rolls. The larger models are for professionals like photographers, graphic artists, and architects. The smaller printers, like our top overall pick, the Epson WorkForce Pro WF-7310, are for small offices or home photo enthusiasts. I've been PCMag's printer expert for decades, and I've tested printers big and small, inkjet and laser, up and down the market. I've developed testing methodologies that measure print speeds and output quality, and we also assess printers on design, usability, and connectivity. Below are our top recommended wide-format printers, carefully selected based on our hands-on testing. After perusing the top picks, take a look at our buying guide to help you shop for a wide-format printer, plus a handy spec comparison.\n\nBuying Guide: The Best Wide-Format Printers for 2025\n\nBuying a wide-format printer isn't all that different from buying one strictly for letter and legal sizes\u2014which for purposes of this discussion, we'll call letter-size printers. Some buying issues are identical regardless of printer size. Connection options, performance, output quality, and the arguments for choosing a laser versus an inkjet, among other considerations, are all problems you'll have to solve for any printer purchase.\n\nBut there are also some differences. To begin with, it's a given that a wide-format printer will be bigger and heavier than an otherwise identical letter-size model, simply because it has to handle bigger sheets of paper. It will also be more expensive. Whether you're shopping for an office or photo printer, it's not hard to find nearly identical twins from the same manufacturer whose only differences aside from size, weight, and price is that one is limited to 8.5-inch wide paper and the other can handle 11- or 13-inch wide paper.\n\nBeyond that, some of the considerations you're familiar with for letter-size printers apply a little differently for tabloid- and supertabloid-size models. In particular, both paper handling and the calculation of running cost are complicated by the likelihood that you'll be printing on letter-size pages as well as larger ones.\n\nYou can find more on the buying considerations that apply to all printers, including wide-format models, in our guide to the best printers, as well as our tips for choosing between inkjet and laser printers. Here, we'll focus on the issues that are specific to the subset of wide-format printers that's of interest to most people: tabloid- and supertabloid-size printers both for office needs and for home use, including for photo enthusiasts. Some of the higher-end photo printers included here deliver high-enough quality to be of interest to professional photographers as well, but we are not including floor-standing models, or any printers that are designed to produce prints at sizes larger than 13 inches on their shortest side.\n\nWhich Size: Should I Get a Tabloid or a Supertabloid Printer?\n\nSimply talking about the printers in this roundup is complicated by the fact that most are designed to handle multiple paper size equivalents, based on varying standards followed by different countries. In the US, tabloid, or ledger-size, is 11 by 17 inches. The equivalent ISO paper size used in much of the rest of the world is A3 size, or 297 by 420 millimeters (mm), which works out to roughly 11.69 by 16.54 inches. Any printer that can print on either size paper will also print on the other, which is why you'll see the same printer referred to as tabloid-size, ledger-size, or A3 size. A similar issue crops up with supertabloid size versus A3+ and Super B. In that case, however, all three are 13 by 19 inches.\n\nIn addition to these variations on names, you'll sometimes see tabloid and supertabloid models grouped together, without any obvious distinction between them, on the grounds that either can serve as a tabloid-size printer. When you're shopping, it's always a good idea to check for the actual maximum paper width the printer you're looking at can use\u201411 inches or 13 inches. It may keep you from overlooking a supertabloid-size printer hidden in a list labeled \"tabloid printers,\" or save you from buying a supertabloid-size model\u2014with its extra size, weight, and cost\u2014when you need only tabloid-size.\n\nWhat Level of Paper Handling Do You Need?\n\nAlthough most paper-handling issues are the same for any size printer, they apply slightly differently for tabloid- and supertabloid-size printers than for letter-size models.\n\nFor letter-size printers, having more one than paper drawer or tray is a useful convenience, both for increasing capacity and letting you switch between different types of paper easily. But if you print almost entirely on one type and size of paper, a single tray will often be enough.\n\nStrictly speaking, the same holds true for a tabloid- or supertabloid-size printer. But with a tabloid-size model, odds are you'll want to use the same printer for both tabloid- and letter-size output, and will be switching back and forth between them repeatedly every day, which can make having at least two trays a necessity. For a supertabloid-size model, two trays may also be enough if you mostly use either tabloid- or supertabloid-size along with letter-size paper. Or, you may need a minimum of three trays, so you can devote one to each paper size.\n\nIn either case, note that some models offer extremely limited paper handling for the largest size paper they accept. We've seen supertabloid-size printers that offer two 250-sheet drawers for up to tabloid-size paper, but are limited to holding 20 sheets or less of supertabloid sheets. We've also seen printers whose supertabloid paper handling is limited to one sheet at a time, using a manual feed tray. Similarly, we've also seen printers that can print on paper as large as supertabloid-size, but offer duplexing (two-sided printing) only up to legal-size.\n\nThe moral of the story is that when shopping, you can't assume that every paper handling feature works with every size paper. You need to check the maximum capacity of each tray for each paper size, and check the kind of duplexing the printer offers for each paper size in each tray. Otherwise, a printer with automatic duplexing, say, may not duplex using the paper size you need.\n\nThe same basic rule applies to paper handling for scanning (including for copying and faxing). We've seen AIOs that can print at up to supertabloid-size but scan only up to tabloid-size (or even only up to legal-size). Here again, make sure the flatbed, ADF, or both can handle the size of paper you need it for. And if you need to scan in duplex, make sure the ADF duplexes with the size of paper you need duplexing for, as well.\n\nThe Tabloid Twist on Running Costs and Total Costs\n\nIn many ways, issues relating to running cost are the same for tabloid- and supertabloid-size printers as for letter-size models. In both cases, you shouldn't get too carried away by a low running cost. As a general rule, printers with low ink costs are more expensive than printers with high ink costs\u2014as is true for comparable tank-based versus cartridge-based inkjets, for example. The number you should be looking at for comparisons is the total cost of ownership\u2014the initial price plus the total cost you'll pay for number of pages you expect to print over the printer's lifetime.\n\nKeep in mind that the standard calculation for cost per page (CPP)\u2014which we quote in our reviews and discuss in detail in our guide to saving money on your next printer\u2014doesn't apply to printing on photo paper. The calculation doesn't include paper cost, because plain paper will be the same price for any printer, which means it won't affect the relative cost from one printer to another for text and graphics output. However, photos need photo paper, which can vary significantly from one paper type to another, even for a single printer. To calculate costs for comparison, you'd have to factor in each of the available photo papers you would use for each printer you're considering, as well as the proportion of photos you'd print on each paper\u2014an almost impossible task.\n\nFor printing on plain paper, computing the total cost of ownership can also take a little more arithmetic than you might like, but the basic concept is simple. Dividing the extra cost of a more-expensive-but-cheaper-to-run printer by the savings per page for that printer tells you how many pages you have to print before its total cost will be lower than for a less-expensive printer with more-expensive ink.\n\nThe added twist for a tabloid- or supertabloid-size printer is that standard CPP calculations are based on single-sided, letter-size pages. So to get the right cost for a tabloid-size page, you have to double the quoted standard CPP for each tabloid page. And because you'll probably be printing letter-size pages, too, you'll need estimate the number of each page size you'll be printing, calculate the total cost for each separately, and add the two to get the total ink cost. (And don't forget to count pages printed on both sides as two pages.) Supertabloid-size pages offer nearly a third more square inches to print on than tabloid-size pages, but how much additional ink you'll use will depend on how large the top, bottom, and side margins are.\n\nStill not sure whether you really need a wide-format printer?

  "summary": "The article discusses the best wide-format printers for 2025, with PCMag's printer expert, Dr. Steve Kohn, author of the magazine's printer guide, and his top overall pick, the Epson WorkForce Pro WF-7310. The article also provides a detailed buying guide to help shoppers shop for a wide-form printer. While there are some differences in purchasing a wide format printer compared to a standard letter-size model, it will be heavier and heavier than an identical model, and likely to be more expensive. However, there are also differences in the buying process for different types of printers, including those designed to handle multiple paper size equivalents. Factors such as connection options, performance, output quality, and the arguments for choosing a laser versus an inkjet, among other considerations, can be resolved through our buying guide. Additionally, the article also discusses the pros and pros for buying a tabloid and supertabloid-size printer.",
