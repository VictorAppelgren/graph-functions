      "feedback": "The analysis draft demonstrates a solid understanding of the macroeconomic landscape, but it could benefit from enhanced clarity and depth in several areas. First, strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking how inflation dynamics and labor market conditions influence monetary policy decisions, using specific examples from the cited sources. Additionally, ensure that the discussion of structural regimes is grounded in first principles, such as real rate differentials and terms of trade, to provide a more robust framework for understanding the economic transition. Avoid vague phrases like \"modest economic recovery\" and instead quantify expectations where possible, such as specifying anticipated growth rates or inflation targets. Lastly, increase citation density by directly referencing specific data points or quotes from the sources to support your claims, and ensure that all critical sources are reconciled, particularly regarding conflicting views on inflation and labor market strength. Overall, aim for a more structured approach that clearly delineates the base case, key risks, and what to watch, while maintaining a concise and coherent narrative.",
