      "title": "A €2 Trillion Dutch Pension Headache Is Coming for European Bonds",
      "summary": "A planned overhaul of the Dutch pension system is poised to shake European bond markets, as the country’s pension funds—holding roughly €300 billion in EU debt—shift from long‑dated hedges to shorter‑dated ones. The transition, scheduled to begin on Jan. 1 and roll out in tranches until 2028, could create a liquidity crunch in the 30‑year euro swap market and steepen the yield curve, prompting asset managers to favor shorter maturities and US Treasuries. The move comes amid a political crisis in the Netherlands and fiscal tensions in France, adding uncertainty to euro‑area debt demand and potentially pushing German and French 30‑year yields higher.",
