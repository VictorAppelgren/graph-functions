  "title": "Global bond sell-off hits Japan\u2019s government debt; pound falls again \u2013 business live",
  "description": "Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news",
  "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.\n\nThe global sell-off in longer-term government debt is continuing, as concerns mount over fiscal sustainability and the health of the global economy.\n\nAfter losses across the bond and equity markets yesterday, there are fresh falls in Asia-Pacific markets today.\n\nJapan is now in the firing line from bond vigilantes, who are driving up borrowing costs (yields) by selling government debt, pushing down prices.\n\nThe 30-year Japanese government bond yield has hit an unprecedented 3.255% today, Reuters reports, following the jump in UK, US and eurozone bond yields on Tuesday\n\nYields on Japan\u2019s 20-year government bonds rose to levels last seen in 1999.\n\nThe sell-off appears to be being driven by several factors, including concerns over rising government debt levels, opposition to measures to cut borrowing, sticky inflation, and economic growth prospects.\n\nInvestors are demanding higher returns to hold bonds exposed to both inflation risk and elevated debt levels. Higher yields, in turn, push up borrowing costs for companies and weigh on valuations. As a result, equities and corporate bonds also kicked off the week on a weak note.\n\nBond investors will be watching London and Paris closely today.\n\nRising bond yields are a political headache for Rachel Reeves, as it eats into the UK chancellor\u2019s headroom to have debt falling in five year\u2019s time. It could force Reeves into further tax rises, despite concerns that this would weaken growth, or spending cuts, despite opposition from her own party.\n\nThe potential collapse of the French government next week, in a row over proposed spending cuts, are also worrying investors.\n\nThe French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou will lose on Monday 8 September a gamble that he was never likely to win and will almost certainly be ejected from office by a parliamentary confidence vote of his own choosing; President Emmanuel Macron has ruled out a new legislative election\u2014for the time being\u2014and will appoint his fifth Prime Minister in 21 months, almost certainly from within his center and center-right coalition. The new PM will be obliged to make concessions on Bayrou\u2019s ambitious plans to cut 0.8% of GDP (nominally \u20ac43.8bn) from France\u2019s deficit next year.\n\u2022 9.15am BST: Bank of England deputy governor Sarah Breeden keynote speech at a conference on innovation in money and payments conference\n\u2022 3pm BST: JOLTS survey of the US jobs market",

      "text": "Rachel Reeves was hit by a fresh sell-off in government bond markets on Tuesday, underlining the formidable challenge facing the chancellor in the run-up to the autumn budget.\nThe yield, or interest rate, on 30-year UK government debt hit its highest level since 1998, at 5.723%, indicating that it will cost the UK more to borrow from the markets.\nYields, which rise when a bond\u2019s price falls, are a measure of the interest rate that investors demand when lending to a government or company.\nThe rising yield on long-dated gilts, as UK government bonds are known, echoed a global shift that has pushed up borrowing costs in other leading economies, amid fears about erratic US policies.\n\u201cThese moves are not anything UK-specific,\u201d said Carsten Jung, the associate director for economic policy at the IPPR thinktank. Treasury officials pointed to similar increases in yields on Tuesday in Germany, the US and France.\nBut with the government already spending more than \u00a3100bn a year in interest on the UK\u2019s debts, the latest jump highlighted the extent to which the government feels constrained by the bond markets.\nThe 10-year gilt yield, which the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) uses to forecast future government borrowing costs, also rose on Tuesday, hitting its highest level since January.\nMeanwhile the pound weakened, falling by more than 1.5 cents against the US dollar to $1.3390, its worst day since early April, when Donald Trump launched his global trade war.\nThese latest market jitters followed a shake-up of key figures inside No 10 that was widely read at Westminster as an attempt by Keir Starmer to get a firmer grip on economic policy.\nThis included poaching Reeves\u2019s deputy, Darren Jones, to a new role as Starmer\u2019s \u201cchief secretary\u201d and appointing a heavyweight new economic adviser, the former Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik.\nConcern that the chancellor is being \u201cmanaged out\u201d is weighing on UK government bonds, suggested Kathleen Brooks, the research director at XTB.\n\u201cThe last time there was a threat to Reeves\u2019s position, back in early July, bond yields jumped as the market worried that she could be replaced by a more left-leaning member of the Labour party,\u201d Brooks said.\nThe chancellor was filmed in tears in the House of Commons chamber in July, briefly prompting bond yields to rise as investors speculated she could be replaced with a more spendthrift alternative.\nBrooks confirmed that the UK was \u201cnot an outlier\u201d in bond markets for the moment, but added: \u201cAs we lead up to the budget, the chancellor\u2019s options are narrowing, and we could see more frequent bursts of bond market volatility. While we are not quite at Liz Truss levels of stress in the UK bond market, the \u2018Starmer moment\u2019 for markets could be coming down the line.\u201d\nReeves has argued that her fiscal rules, which some Labour MPs feel unnecessarily limit the government\u2019s scope for action, reflect real-world limits on investors\u2019 appetite for the UK\u2019s debt.\nThe rules, which apply in five years\u2019 time, require her to balance day-to-day spending with tax receipts and reduce debt as a share of GDP.\nIn a budget now not expected until mid-November at the earliest, the chancellor is widely expected to be forced to raise extra revenue with a fresh round of tax increases, to rebuild the \u201cheadroom\u201d against these rules.\nThe city consultancy Capital Economics has predicted that weaker OBR forecasts may mean she has to raise \u00a318-28bn to leave herself with a buffer of \u00a39.9bn.\nA recent flurry of reports about potential budget tax rises have worried bond investors, according to Marcus Jennings, a fixed-income strategist at Schroders.\n\u201cBroadly speaking, whilst no specific policy has caused a sell-off in government bonds in isolation, the rush of potential policies is a reminder of how challenged the UK\u2019s fiscal position is. This has likely facilitated a move higher in yields in the UK, notwithstanding the global move in long-end yields,\u201d Jennings said.\nThe Treasury is keen to damp down some of this speculation. Bank shares fell sharply last Friday after suggestions of a tax on the highly profitable sector. Ministers are also believed to be examining options for taxing property more heavily.\nOfficials insist that tax changes will be focused on boosting economic efficiency, while Reeves\u2019s central focus will remain improving the UK\u2019s lacklustre productivity.\nIt is a downgrade of the OBR\u2019s forecasts for future productivity \u2013 the amount UK workers can produce in an hour, and a key determinant of economic growth \u2013 that is expected to weigh on its budget projections.\nThe institution\u2019s expectations for productivity are more optimistic than those of many other forecasters, and have repeatedly been disappointed in the recent past.\nAny shortfall against Reeves\u2019s fiscal rule appears unlikely to be closed through significant spending cuts, after a backbench rebellion forced Downing Street to abandon plans for \u00a35bn of disability cuts earlier this year.\nWhile bond prices fell on Tuesday, traders piled in to precious metals in a flight to safety. This pushed the gold price up to a new record high of $3,508 (\u00a32,607) an ounce on Tuesday, while silver rose over $40 an ounce for the first time since 2011.\nAnxiety over fiscal sustainability is another factor hitting the bond market, with Donald Trump\u2019s recent tax cuts and spending bill expected to add trillions of dollars to the US national debt. Trump\u2019s recent attacks on the independence of the central bank, the Federal Reserve, have also rattled investors."

  "argos_summary": "Global long\u2011term government bond yields have spiked as investors grow wary of fiscal sustainability, pushing Japan\u2019s 30\u2011year yield to a 1999\u2011level 3.255% and the UK\u2019s 30\u2011year gilt yield to its highest since 1998 at 5.723%. The sell\u2011off is driven by concerns over rising debt, sticky inflation, and potential fiscal tightening, especially in the UK where Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces pressure to raise revenue ahead of the budget. The higher yields are raising borrowing costs for governments and corporates, weighing on equity markets, while safe\u2011haven demand has lifted gold to record highs.",
