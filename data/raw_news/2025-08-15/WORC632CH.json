  "title": "Rewriting the rules of enterprise growth: How LG NOVA is launching AI-native ventures without relying on M&A",
  "description": "For enterprise leaders looking to expand into new markets, LG NOVA\u2019s model offers a viable alternative to M&A or long-cycle R&D. It\u2019s a repeatable, partnership-driven playbook that blends startup innovation with corporate scale.",
  "content": "Now, that framework is moving from theory to reality. Through its innovation unit, LG NOVA, LG Electronics has launched two new ventures that showcase this collaborative model in action: PADO, an AI-powered orchestration platform for data center energy management, and Primefocus Health, a home healthcare solution focused on chronic disease monitoring and post-discharge care. Each reflects LG NOVA\u2019s deliberate pivot toward building AI-native businesses in high-impact categories like health tech, clean tech, and energy optimization. \u201cThese companies aren\u2019t just ideas,\u201d says Rhee, executive vice president at LG Electronics and head of LG NOVA. \u201cThey\u2019re real-world examples of how a large corporation can create new ventures from scratch\u2014faster, smarter, and without doing everything internally.\u201d\n\nRather than starting with internal ideas, LG NOVA looks outward to support external innovation. Each year, the team interacts with roughly 1,000 startups to identify patterns across sectors and technologies. \u201cIf you look at one or two startups, you only get part of the story,\u201d says Rhee. \u201cBut if you look at a thousand, you can do real statistical analysis on where the market is heading.\u201d That analysis results in about two dozen internal business concepts annually. A rigorous funneling process narrows that down to one or two spinouts per year, each built in collaboration with ecosystem partners. PADO and Primefocus Health emerged from that pipeline.\n\nPrimefocus, launched in 2024, is tackling the increasingly critical space of remote care. \u201cWhen patients are discharged from hospitals, they still need to be monitored, especially those with chronic conditions like diabetes or musculoskeletal disorders,\u201d says Rhee. \u201cPrimefocus gives providers a way to continue managing care at home, with better data and better outcomes.\u201d PADO, which launched earlier this year, focuses on sustainability in one of the world\u2019s most power-hungry industries: data centers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a surprising amount of energy waste even within a single data center,\u201d Rhee explains. \u201cPADO uses AI to optimize how power is distributed inside the facility, reducing energy consumption and cost. As AI infrastructure expands, this kind of orchestration will be essential to fueling the growth that AI computing will demand.\u201d Unlike traditional corporate accelerators or M&A-focused ventures, LG NOVA doesn\u2019t acquire startups or simply invest passively. It aims to build companies. Each new venture is led by an entrepreneur-in-residence\u2014often a founder with prior exits\u2014who helps develop the concept inside LG NOVA and ultimately becomes CEO of the spinout.\n\n\u201cPeople assume that if you want startup innovation, you need to buy it,\u201d says Rhee. \u201cBut that\u2019s not always true. We build these businesses ourselves, and then we strategically license or partner for key components. It\u2019s modular by design.\u201d That was the case with PADO. While the core AI engine was developed internally, the PADO team didn\u2019t waste time trying to build non-core components from scratch. \u201cWe licensed technologies from startups to fill where we didn\u2019t need to build,\u201d says Rhee. \u201cIt saved time and let us focus on the parts that mattered most.\u201d\n\nOne major advantage of LG NOVA\u2019s model is its ability to secure early market traction through ecosystem partnerships. In the case of Primefocus Health, the company had a first customer\u2014Marshall Health in West Virginia\u2014lined up before the product launched. \u201cAs a startup, getting that first customer is often the hardest thing,\u201d Rhee says. \u201cBy bringing in partners early, we de-risk the launch. We\u2019ve even seen state governments express interest in hosting pilot deployments because it means job creation and economic growth.\u201d LG NOVA also co-invests alongside outside funders through an external venture fund. While that diversifies risk, it also adds critical outside perspective.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t assume we\u2019re always right,\u201d says Rhee. \u201cExternal investors challenge our thinking. If they say, \u2018This is where the market is going,\u2019 we take that seriously.\u201d Building startups inside a Fortune Global 500 company isn\u2019t easy. Timelines, expectations, and resource allocations all look different. That\u2019s why LG NOVA\u2019s process is uniquely designed to work within corporate constraints without sacrificing startup momentum.\n\n\u201cLarge companies want results in a few years\u2014not decades,\u201d Rhee says. \u201cSo, we intentionally focus on ventures that could become billion-dollar businesses within five years. That\u2019s our benchmark.\u201d Resource constraints also influence how ideas are prioritized. \u201cLG is a big company, but that doesn\u2019t mean LG NOVA gets unlimited support,\u201d he adds. \u201cEvery decision has to account for time, capital, and organizational patience.\u201d As a result, the team is constantly iterating its launch process. Primefocus was introduced with a partially developed product that matured post-launch. PADO, by contrast, was more fully formed at the time of its debut. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as 100% ready,\u201d Rhee says. \u201cBut the more ventures we launch, the more we refine what \u2018ready enough\u2019 really means.\u201d",
