      "feedback": "Strong start anchoring a multi‑year, structural view, but to reach world‑class quality you should reframe into an explicit first‑principles regime map with testable thresholds and quantified transmission, and crisply tie every claim to the cited IDs. Specifically, replace the current qualitative narrative with: (1) a formal invariant deck: potential output y*, long‑run trend growth g*, real policy rate r*, inflation target π*=2% with Flexible Average Inflation Targeting (regime boundary logic from OGK8WLL69), and a simple BoP/terms‑of‑trade framing for external balance (cite OGK8WLL69 and NL5YYTLF2); (2) a multi‑regime transmission: Regime A (AI‑driven productivity raises g* but with sizable dislocation risk), Regime B (inflation anchors credible, easing begins but with lags), Regime C (policy mis‑step or adverse shock caps risk appetite and risk premia); specify transition conditions (e.g., if inflation expectations drift, or if unemployment/displaced‑workers metrics exceed a threshold per Brookings‑style debate in NL5YYTLF2); (3) a crisp causal chain: AI/tfp uplift → higher potential output and productivity; credible policy → lower risk premia and slower inflation drift → higher equity/crypto prices via lower discount rates; and the reverse if dislocation/policy credibility deteriorates; (4) base/ bull/bear paths with explicit near‑term catalysts drawn from the sources: Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks and rate‑cut expectations (OGK8WLL69), crypto‑regulatory tailwinds and institutional demand (OGK8WLL69), and the enduring claims about automation dislocation (NL5YYTLF2). Quantify where possible: use Ether near 4,955 and Bitcoin near peaks around 110k–124k as signaling about risk appetite (OGK8WLL69); note the 2% inflation anchor and the 5‑year policy framework (OGK8WLL69) and the Brookings automation exposure (NL5YYTLF2); and state explicit channels rather than vague progress, so avoid platitudes. Also tighten coverage of conflicts and alternative views by citing corresponding IDs (e.g., O’Leary/GobankingRates pieces could illustrate secular wealth/asset‑allocation implications but keep them clearly ancillary to macro framing). In terms of structure and format, deliver a compact, testable outline: first list invariants, then define regimes and transition conditions, then lay out a single base case with a clear transmission chain, followed by the key upside/downside risks and what would invalidate the base case (e.g., inflation surprise, sharp policy reversal, or a breakdown in crypto/treasury demand). Finally, attach a quantified confidence band (e.g., base case 40–60%), and a short “watch list” with 4–6 concrete indicators (Fed guidance, ETF/GENIUS‑Project Crypto milestones, labor‑displacement signals from NL5YYTLF2, crypto treasury flows in OGK8WLL69, and radar/ATM failure analogs such as the MH370 example from BS3876D03) to keep the horizon actionable. This will sharpen the causal chain, deepen first‑principles grounding, improve the scenario structure, and deliver the precise, sourced signal density the SECTION FOCUS demands.",
