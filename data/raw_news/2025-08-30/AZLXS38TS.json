  "description": "TSX stocks this week: Analysts parsed through the Big Six bank earnings and crunched some numbers to come up with new price targets. Read on",
  "content": "Rizvanovic also raised his price target for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TSX:CM) to $116 from $101 \u201cafter another solid quarter.\u201d The stock is currently trading around $106. \u201cWe remain positive on CM coming out of the quarter, with the bank putting up another set of clean results and showing further signs of consistent, steady improvement across key operating metrics,\u201d Rizvanovic said. RBC Capital Markets\u2019 Darko Mihelic hiked his price target for Bank of Nova Scotia (TSX:BNS) to $86 from $80 after the bank reported lower than expected PCLs and \u201cbetter than expected net interest income.\u201d Mihelic expects earnings growth to improve in 2026, \u201cdriven by total revenues and lower PCLs rather than strong loan growth.\u201d Mihelic also hiked his target price for Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO) to $168 from $161. The stock is trading around $165. Mihelic said it appears that PCLs have \u201cpeaked\u201d in the U.S., with RBC lowering its assumptions in that area. He also gave a thumbs up to the bank\u2019s repurchase and cancellation of shares as \u201ca solid signal of usage of excess capital,\u201d he said in a note. National Bank of Canada (TSX:NA) was an outlier among the Big Six, missing estimates on earnings per share, with TD analyst Mendonca citing as the cause lower trading revenues and dilution of shares from issuance related to the purchase of Canadian Western Bank. Mendonca did note however that gains from that deal have yet to be realized. He lowered his price target to $148, from $152. National is currently trading around $145. The Montreal-based discount retailer Dollarama Inc. (TSX:DOL) is on a roll, with BMO Capital Markets analyst Etienne Ricard viewing the company as a \u201ccore Canadian consumer holding\u201d while maintaining a price target of $215. The stock is currently trading around $187. Dollarama reported growth this week from its expansions into Australia and Mexico, while executives noted that shoppers showed signs during the quarter of both resilience and fragility. \u201cWhile DOL highlighted an \u2018inconsistent\u2019 consumer for general merchandise and seasonal items, DOL has nonetheless exceeded expectations year to date without meaningful growth contributions from these,\u201d Ricard said in a note. Brian Morrison at TD Securities has a price target of $210 on the stock and said in a note that the chain\u2019s prospects in Mexico and Australia help support \u201cits admittedly \u2018rich\u2019 valuation.\u201d The maker of Sea-Doos and Ski-Doos ran into rough weather on higher interest rates and after tariff uncertainty sapped demand, but analysts at TD Securities now think BRP Inc. (TSX:DOO) might be through the worst of its downturn after the Montreal-based manufacturer beat estimates. Brian Morrison at TD raised his price target to $106 from $87, which he had already hiked in mid-August from an earlier target of $70. \u201cExpect upward consensus revisions (on the stock price) despite the \u2018soft\u2019 retail environment,\u201d he said in a note. He thinks BRP shares will get their next leg up from lower interest rates.",

      "text": "Trans Mountain CEO says Ottawa should wait three to five years before unloading pipeline system\n'In my heart of hearts, (the time to sell is) a few years out,' said Mark Maki\nThe chief executive of Trans Mountain Corp. says the federal government should wait three to five years to unload the pipeline system after the company nearly doubled a core performance measure in the second quarter.\nMark Maki, who rose to the CEO job last September after serving as chief financial officer, said Trans Mountain was returning significant cash to Canadians, and that its valuation would likely only grow as it reached operating capacity.\n\u201cIn my heart of hearts, (the time to sell is) a few years out. I would say three to five,\u201d Maki said.\nTrans Mountain\u2019s adjusted earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) rose to $558 million in the second quarter, which ended June 30, nearly double the $283 million in the corresponding period a year earlier, which only partially included the commercial effects of the expanded system.\nYear-to-date throughput pipeline was 730,000 barrels per day, up from 402,000 barrels per day in the corresponding period last year, pegging utilization during the 2025 period at 82 per cent.\n\u201cSince the beginning of the year, we\u2019ve returned $729 million to the federal government through interest, fees and dividends,\u201d Maki said. \u201cWe\u2019re on track to exceed $1.25 billion by year-end. These are tangible returns to Canadians.\u201d\nThe federal government, which purchased Trans Mountain in 2018 for $4.5 billion and funded an expansion that cost $34 billion, will continue receiving dividends and interest payments until the pipeline is sold.\nAs for a buyer, Maki said a large pension fund, possible one of Canada\u2019s own, would make sense as owner of the pipeline system that transports oil to from Alberta to British Columbia\u2019s coast and into Washington State.\n\u201cI spent lots of time visiting those folks over the years, and there\u2019s a really nice match of what this asset is with the long term obligations of pension funds, so there\u2019s a real logical owner there,\u201d he said.\n- Ottawa may not want to get out of the pipeline business just yet: Trans Mountain CEO\n- 'Northern Leg' to Trans Mountain pipeline attracts interest amid brewing trade war\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nBut for now, he said, uncertainties over toll rates \u2014 hearings before the Canada Energy Regulator are to take place this summer, with final arguments schedule for early 2026 \u2014 in addition to extra capacity in the pipeline and expansion plans that would take two to four years to complete, mean the government would be selling below the ultimate value.\n\u201cAll of those are things that a buyer, when they look at this, is going to go, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to discount for that,\u2019\u201d Maki said.\n\u201cTake away those uncertainties on the front end, and it becomes more of an annuity they (pension funds) can value. If I\u2019m thinking about strategy of sale, it would be get rid of uncertainties on the front end and then have a conversation about the back end, and that\u2019ll be a constructive process.\u201d\nHe said more time as a federal Crown corporation would also allow Trans Mountain to continue to build value for Ottawa by reaching operating capacity, something that hasn\u2019t happened since commercial operations began on the expanded system last May.\nIt has been suggested that oil companies are reluctant to increase their use of Trans Mountain while toll rates remain disputed, but Maki said August and September should both be strong, with the system now running at closer to 90 per cent of capacity.\nHe added that the price differential between West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Western Canada Select had narrowed but is now widening again, suggesting concerns that capacity is going to get tight.\n\u201cThe things that we\u2019ve been talking about in the public domain, about adding a little bit of capacity in the system, will be timely because the network is starting to fill up,\u201d he said.\nTrans Mountain has been exploring short and long-term projects with an aim of increasing pipeline capacity by 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day. These include introducing drag-reducing agents to increase flow efficiency and building out electric motors and pumps to increase the \u201chorsepower\u201d of the operations.\nMaki said the latter, if it moves ahead, would not be concluded until close the end of the decade.\nHe said expansion of Trans Mountain fits with Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s plans to unfurl \u201cnation building\u201d projects to create economic corridors and an energy powerhouse and reduce reliance on the United States amid trade tensions.\n\u201cThis asset can serve the States but also can serve Asia,\u201d he said of the system that runs from Edmonton to Burnaby, B.C., with a branch into Washington State.\n\u201cThe bulk of the system starts in Canada, ends in Canada, and so it\u2019s immune to a lot of \u2026 the tariff stuff,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is a really important piece of infrastructure for the country. It is nation-building infrastructure.\u201d\nSecond-quarter net income was $150 million compared to a net loss of $48 million a year earlier. Trans Mountain said the improvement was due to commercial commencement of the expanded system and a strengthened balance sheet.\nTransportation revenues increased by 85 per cent during the second quarter, while operating expenses rose by less than 44 per cent.\n\u2022 Email: bshecter@nationalpost.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Here's who is buying new homes in Canada's chilly housing market (and it isn't investors)\n'It's a crazy market out there with condos'\nThere were just over 300 new homes sold across the entire Toronto region in April. A population of about 6.4 million people was mainly too scared to pull the trigger.\nIt was one of the worst months ever for sales, according to the Building Industry and Land Development Association. The market hasn\u2019t improved much since.\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Kim Meszaros, an insurance adjuster in her late 50s, who is one of the few to have jumped into the frigid waters of Canada\u2019s largest housing market in recent months.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really planned but at this stage, because I\u2019m not quite retired, but I am looking ahead,\u201d she said, adding she has been in the same house for 20 years and figured she wanted to downsize sooner rather than later.\nMeszaros found her dream spot in Oakville, southwest of Toronto, in a project planned by Graywood Developments called Claystone Condos, which is aiming to attract end users as opposed to investors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy market out there with condos,\u201d she said, fully aware of the drop in sales and prices. June sales were just 510 units, 82 per cent below the 10-year average for the month, BILD said.\nRon Butler, a mortgage broker who has been vocal about Toronto\u2019s condominium market prices falling further, believes the number of presales is effectively closer to zero because projects sold today won\u2019t be built.\n\u201cShe is the one scenario where you can buy where it is a lifestyle choice,\u201d said Butler, adding that for investors, the math no longer works. \u201cThe sales happening are mostly fictitious\u2026. What will be built is closer to zero.\u201d\nAlthough he said there will be exceptions and they will be well-financed projects from developers with strong balance sheets. If you can wait, Butler said there will be much more downward pressure on existing high-rise condo prices.\nAt the same time, he believes rents will continue to fall because apartment construction is at levels not seen in decades.\n- Canadians planning to sell U.S. property amid political tensions\n- REITs aren't part of the housing affordability problem\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\n\u201cThere is a play for the couple who haven\u2019t started a family, but their rent is going down,\u201d said Butler. They can wait and time the market.\nMeszaros\u2019 logic is pretty sound. Her daughter just graduated, has a job and is close to moving out, so it made sense to downsize.\nShe owns the luxury of time and has no frantic need to buy, the force that drive much of the action at the peak of the market.\nHer dream 930-square-foot, two-bedroom-plus-den unit near Lake Ontario in a perfect community won\u2019t be ready until 2028. Still, she had the luxury of being picky, choosing a building with an architect she liked and even getting a free parking spot with an electric vehicle charging station, on top of her chosen finishes.\n\u201cI do interior design on the side, and that is important to me,\u201d Meszaros said.\nWith possession three years away, Meszaros still faces the task of selling her 25-year-old house, but she feels a recent renovation will help, and she can handle a price drop.\n\u201cEven if it is $100,000 off. Well, two years ago, at the COVID peak, I knew that was inflated,\u201d she said.\nHer other risk is that the developer may not finish the project or cancel it, but she is less worried on that front.\n\u201cI did my research,\u201d she said, adding that a condo she purchased in Collingwood, Ont., during the peak pandemic period was eventually cancelled. \u201cI got my money, but was a little gun-shy.\u201d\nStephen Price, the president and chief executive of Graywood Developments, said people buying today are end users like Meszaros.\n\u201cThe market has changed rather violently, and the investor has gone on holiday,\u201d said Price.\nHe said the Claystone project, which launched in January with Japan\u2019s Hankyu Hanshin Properties Corp., will be successful because it is aimed directly at end users.\n\u201cWe had no misconceptions,\u201d said Price, adding that the traditional target of reaching 70 per cent presale is now achieved on a different, less certain timeline. \u201cIt was 12 months to reach from launch, and transitioned to six months, and then you started to see condos reach that in three months. We reached that level in three days on one deal.\u201d\nPrice said the difference today is that the market is facing a buyer who will live in the unit and take their time to make a purchase. It\u2019s no longer just a commodity.\n\u201cThey will come in multiple times to talk to the salesperson. They want to live and breathe the experience they hope to achieve,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not just buying square footage. They are buying a home.\u201d\nMore importantly, the developer said, users want to know \u201cthe building is going to happen,\u201d and he emphasized that his group has more than enough capital behind it.\n\u201cThat confidence is an important draw,\u201d he said.\nJustin Sherwood, senior vice-president of stakeholder relations, research and communications with BILD, said those buying today have at least one incredible luxury: that of choice.\n\u201cYou have 22,000 different units you could be considering, from a single family, to a semi, to a townhouse, to a condo. You name it. Every possible permutation of housing is out there,\u201d said Sherwood. \u201cYou can be picky about where you want, and you have time to think about it. This is choice you haven\u2019t had in 20 years. You have pricing, you haven\u2019t seen since 2019.\u201d\nEven with all the research she did, Meszaros knows it sounds wild to buy today; she bucked a massive trend away from new homes. \u201cI\u2019m not worried. If things get ugly selling, maybe I work an extra year,\u201d she said. \u201cThis just came at the right time.\u201d\nThat is one of the trickiest issues about housing. Your home is an investment, but your life doesn\u2019t always match the market\u2019s timing.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Bank of Canada could start cutting rates again as tariffs wallop economy, say economists\nGDP data shows economy reversed course in the second quarter\nSome economists think there is a case to be made for the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates after the economy contracted 1.6 per cent in the second quarter, crushing the average estimate of -0.7 per cent.\nStatistics Canada released its latest gross domestic product (GDP) numbers on Friday. The report showed the economy reversed course in the second quarter after expanding by two per cent on an annualized basis in the previous one. Exports to the United States dropped 7.5 per cent from April to June compared with the previous quarter.\nThe Bank of Canada projected in its most recent Monetary Policy Report (MPR) that GDP would contract 1.5 per cent quarter over quarter under its current tariff scenario \u2014 one of three.\nHere\u2019s what economists think the GDP numbers mean for the economy and any future Bank of Canada interest rate cuts.\n\u2018Not all bad news\u2019: BMO\nWhile the second quarter GDP report certainly put up some bad numbers, \u201cit wasn\u2019t all bad news,\u201d Benjamin Reitzes, managing director of Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in note, pointing to firmness in the domestic economy, including a 4.5 per cent annualized rebound in household spending and a gain of 6.3 per cent in residential investment.\n\u201cFinal domestic demand rose 3.5 per cent annualized, reflecting the resilience and perhaps Canadians\u2019 bias to buy/travel domestically,\u201d Reitzes said.\nHowever, income growth slowed and he cautioned that a lower savings rate among Canadians could lead to less spending.\nFor the Bank of Canada, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing here screaming for a September cut,\u201d Reitzes said, noting that the difference between the central bank\u2019s estimate for the quarter and the actual result was \u201cminor.\u201d\nSigns that the third quarter is tracking lower than their estimate of one per cent poses one possible \u201cnegative\u201d for the Bank of Canada.\n- Canada's economy shrinks more than expected as exports to U.S. plummet\n- Tariffs push Canada's current account deficit to record\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nReitzes said BMO is currently tracking third quarter growth at 0.5 per cent.\n\u201cArguably, the economy is evolving largely in line with the BoC\u2019s July MPR forecast. Policymakers opted to stay on hold then, so this report likely doesn\u2019t push them any closer to cutting in September, with the LFS (Labour Force Survey) and CPI (consumer price index) still to come,\u201d Reitzes said.\n\u2018Better Q3 on tap\u2019: TD\nWeaker U.S. demand and the ricochet effects of tariff frontrunning in the first quarter \u201cwalloped\u201d Canada\u2019s GDP in the second quarter, Rishi Sodhi, an economist with TD Economics, said in a note.\nStill, the resilience of Canadians consumers, evident in the data, likely \u201csurprised\u201d Bank of Canada policymakers, who could fold that into arguments to hold interest rates at their Sept. 17 meeting.\nHowever, the second-quarter contraction shows that slack is continuing to build, and \u201ceven with a better performance in Q3 likely on tap, the economy probably remains in excess supply,\u201d Sondhi said.\nOngoing slack, where the economy is producing more than is being consumed, could continue to push down inflation. paving the way for further interest rate cuts.\nMarkets are currently pricing in a 55 per cent chance of a rate cut in September, Sondhi said.\n\u2018Easing\u2019 trade tensions: Desjardins\n\u201cSimply put, the tariff war with the U.S. was terrible for the Canadian economy,\u201d Royce Mendes, managing director and head of macro strategy at Desjardins Securities, said in a note.\nBut he thinks there is plenty of reason to believe that trade tensions are \u201ceasing\u201d between Canada and the U.S., especially given that most exports appear to be compliant with the Canada\u2013United-States\u2013Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), significantly reducing \u201ctail risks\u201d to the economy.\nThat said, Mendes is looking for the third quarter to come in either flat or slightly negative, given that the July flash estimate from Statistics Canada showed GDP growing by a slim 0.1 per cent.\nIf growth were to contract in the third quarter, that would create the conditions for a technical recession \u2014 two consecutive quarters of negative growth.\nHowever, Mendes doesn\u2019t think the recession label would apply \u201csince that involves very specific ingredients.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I would say is that it doesn\u2019t look like the economy is set to bounce back from its Q2 contraction. Rather, it appears that the economy entered the third quarter dazed and confused from the tariff woes of the second quarter,\u201d he said in an email.\nGiven the significant miss on estimates for the second quarter and an apparent lack of momentum so far in the third, Desjardins is sticking with its call that the Bank of Canada will start cutting rates again in September.\n\u2022 Email: gmvsuhanic@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Canada's economy shrinks more than expected as exports to U.S. plummet\nWeaker GDP numbers could spur Bank of Canada to cut interest rates next month\nCanada\u2019s economy contracted in the second quarter of this year due to \u201csignificant declines\u201d in the export of goods, driven by United States-imposed tariffs, and decreased business investment in machinery and equipment, Statistics Canada reported Friday.\nReal gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total monetary value of goods and services produced in a country, declined 0.4 per cent after a 0.5 per cent gain the previous quarter, the national data agency said. On a per capita basis, GDP was down 0.4 per cent, after an increase of 0.4 per cent in the previous quarter.\nAnnualized, the economy shrank 1.6 per cent in the second quarter, slowing from growth of two per cent in the first quarter of 2025. This was worse than the consensus projection of 0.7 per cent, but \u201cbroadly in line\u201d with the Bank of Canada\u2019s July forecast, CIBC economist Andrew Grantham said in a note on Friday.\nAside from a slump in exports, Grantham also credited a \u201creversal\u201d of the first quarter\u2019s front-loading activity for the contraction.\nThe weaker-than-expected GDP numbers could drive the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates in September, after keeping the rates steady at 2.75 per cent in its last three meetings, Desjardins economist Royce Mendes said in a note on Friday.\n\u201cAs a result of the headline miss for Q2 and no signs of momentum heading into the third quarter, we are retaining our forecast that the Bank of Canada will resume its cutting cycle in September,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernment of Canada bond yields are falling, as analysts in the \u201cno cut\u201d camp revisit their assumptions and traders begin to price in more easing.\u201d\nThe \u201cgood news\u201d though is that trade tensions between Canada and the United States have been easing, said Mendes, with most goods crossing the border in compliance with the Canada-United-States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).\n\u201cMoreover, the reduction in retaliatory tariffs will remove any lingering concerns at the Bank of Canada about tariff-induced inflation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, the Canadian economy is still far from firing on all cylinders.\u201d\n- Tariffs push Canada's current account deficit to record\n- Tariffs shake Canada's steel city to the core\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nExports declined by 7.5 per cent in the second quarter that ended on June 30, after increasing by 1.4 per cent in the first quarter.\nInternational exports of passenger cars and light trucks \u201cplummeted\u201d by 24.7 per cent in the quarter, Statistics Canada said, while exports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts and travel services declined by 18.5 and 11.1 per cent, respectively.\nInternational imports declined by 1.3 per cent as well, after rising 0.9 per cent in the previous quarter.\nImports of passenger vehicles fell by 9.2 per cent, whereas imports of metal products such as unwrought gold, silver and platinum group metals increased by 35.8 per cent.\nExport and import prices fell by 3.3 and 2.3 per cent respectively in the quarter, which suggests that businesses likely absorbed some of the additional costs of tariffs by lowering prices, Statistics Canada said.\nBusiness investment fell by 0.6 per cent overall, led by a \u201cmuch weaker investment\u201d in machinery and equipment. The 9.4 per cent decline in this category was the slowest pace of investment since the end of 2016 \u2013 outside of the pandemic.\nCompensation of employees grew up by 0.2 per cent \u2014 also the smallest increase since the second quarter of 2016. While wages were up in construction, federal government public administration and the mining sectors, they fell in finance and real estate.\nThe lower growth in salaries also pulled household savings down to five per cent from six per cent in the previous quarter.\nThe removal of the carbon tax on April 1, led to a 4.2 per cent revenue decline for the federal government, Statistics Canada said. In addition, government spending increased 1.8 per cent. These factors led to an \u201cacceleration in the net borrowing\u201d for the federal government in the second quarter.\n\u2022 Email: nkarim@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

The odds of a Bank of Canada rate cut when policymakers meet on Sept. 17 have since risen to 50-50, Noah Buffam, an associate in fixed income, currency and commodities at CIBC Capital Markets, said in an email.\nThe survey, which is viewed as less volatile than the Labour Force Survey (LFS), helps \u201cto understand the underlying trend in the labour market as the last two LFS reports have shown significant volatility, with June strong and July weak,\u201d he said in a note before the SEPH data came out.\nCanada\u2019s jobs numbers have been topsy-turvy of late, rising by 83,000 positions in June before plummeting by 41,000 in July. That\u2019s made it harder for analysts and economists to get a handle on what is really going on with the workforce.\nBuffam said the latest SEPH report revealed some weakness building up in non-tariff-affected sectors, including retail, construction, health care and social assistance.\n\u201cThis is important as (Bank of Canada) governor (Tiff) Macklem linked further easing to economic weakness spreading to less tariff-sensitive sectors,\u201d he said.\nIn a press conference following the Bank of Canada\u2019s last interest rate decision, when policymakers held rates at 2.75 per cent for the third consecutive time, Macklem said fellow governors had the economy as a whole in their sights, including how much \u201cspillover\u201d there is from the most-affected sectors onto the rest of the economy.\n\u201cIf those spillovers are bigger and there is more downward pressure on inflation and the upward pressure from tariffs and trade disruption is contained, there may be a need to cut interest rates further,\u201d he said.\n- Posthaste: Here's how Donald Trump could take over the Fed \u2013 and why that's bad\n- Posthaste: Most Canadians feel worse off now than in 2020\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nFor example, the retail sector shed a bit more than 8,000 positions in June, while employment in construction declined by nearly 5,200 jobs.\nSectors directly affected by tariffs continued to lose jobs. Employment in manufacturing fell by around 8,300 jobs in June and is cumulatively down by 26,600 jobs since January. Transportation equipment manufacturing \u201cwas the largest contributor to the overall decline recorded since January,\u201d followed by chemical manufacturing and machinery manufacturing, Statistics Canada said in its SEPH release.\nBut Shelly Kaushik, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, doesn\u2019t think the latest labour data will hold that much sway over the Bank of Canada.\n\u201cWhile the June Labour Force Survey was solid, the July report was quite weak \u2026 both that, and the June SEPH, highlight how difficult it is to interpret Canadian jobs data,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cStill, the big picture is one of building slack in the labour market, as highlighted by the number of unemployed people per job vacancy and the rising jobless rate.\u201d\nThere were 3.2 unemployed people per job vacancy in June, according to Statistics Canada, down from 3.3 in May, but up year over year as the number of jobless rose in tandem with a decline in the job openings. The unemployment rate stands at 6.9 per cent, up from 6.6 per cent at the start of year and well off the low of 4.8 per cent in 2022.\nKaushik said she\u2019ll be watching Friday\u2019s second-quarter gross domestic product release as well as August\u2019s consumer price index and Labour Force Survey data to provide clues about what the Bank of Canada will do.\n\u201cThat will give us more up-to-date numbers that could help inform the (Bank of Canada\u2019s) thinking,\u201d she said.\nSign up here to get Posthaste delivered straight to your inbox.\nCanada\u2019s current account deficit reached the widest on record in the second quarter as the country\u2019s exports to the U.S. dropped because of the trade dispute.\nThe shortfall rose to $21.16 billion in the second quarter, Statistics Canada reported Thursday.

Analysts say a uranium shortage could power it even higher\nTSX stocks this week: Analysts parsed through Big Six bank earnings and crunched some numbers to come up with new price targets\nCanadian uranium producer Cameco warned this week that production at one of its mines might come up short, which may not necessarily be bad news for shareholders. Meanwhile, analysts parsed through the Big Six bank earnings and crunched some numbers to come up with new price targets, plus we look at two Canadian retail stalwarts that got share price upgrades.\nStock of the Week: Cameco Corp.\nAnalysts at BMO Capital Markets and TD Securities think Canadian uranium producer Cameco Corp. (TSX:CCO) is poised to break out of the range it has been stuck in since late July after gaining nearly 110 per cent over the last four months as the case for building nuclear energy facilities gains more traction. Alexander Pearce, a metals and mining analyst at BMO, upgraded his price target for Cameco to $120 from $110. The stock is currently trading around the $106 dollar mark and had been a bit range-bound after hitting a high of $109.10 on July 25. Pearce hiked his target based on a potential uranium shortage after Cameco this week reported lower than expected production at its McArthur River mine. The World Nuclear Symposium is set to take place next week, which the BMO analyst views as \u201cthe positive catalyst needed for increased contracting and another leg-up in sentiment.\u201d TD analyst Craig Hutchison maintained his price target of $117 \u201cbased on historical precedent where industry-wide shortfalls typically result in higher spot uranium prices and corresponding positive reaction for uranium equities.\u201d\nKeeping score\n- top 5 stocks TSX and SP 500\n- Canadians pile up on U.S. stocks despite Donald Trump's trade war\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nWhere analysts think Big Bank shares are headed\nThe Big Six banks reported earnings this week. Here\u2019s where analysts see the stocks headed after most of them beat estimates.\nRoyal Bank of Canada\nTD Securities upgraded its price target for Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY), the biggest of the Big Six banks, to $208 from $191. The stock is currently trading just under $200. TD analyst Mario Mendonca cited the better than expected increase to provisions for credit losses (PCLs, the reserves lenders set aside for potential loan losses), strong capital markets trading and more gains from the purchase of HSBC Bank Canada. Mendonca said he expected the pace of share buybacks to slow.\nToronto-Dominion Bank\nBank of Nova Scotia analyst Mike Rizvanovic moved up his target price \u201cmodestly\u201d for TD to $104 from $95 after Toronto-Dominion Bank (TSX:TD), Canada\u2019s second-largest bank by market capitalization, posted a \u201cgood\u201d quarter on PCLs moving in the right direction and \u201cmanagement sounding more confident in its outlook than last quarter.\u201d Rizvanovic did note that expense headwinds could continue to blow related to TD\u2019s U.S. retail division, but unrelated to anti-money laundering initiatives (the lack of which the bank was fined for in October).\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\nRizvanovic also raised his price target for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TSX:CM) to $116 from $101 \u201cafter another solid quarter.\u201d The stock is currently trading around $106. \u201cWe remain positive on CM coming out of the quarter, with the bank putting up another set of clean results and showing further signs of consistent, steady improvement across key operating metrics,\u201d Rizvanovic said.\nBank of Nova Scotia\nRBC Capital Markets\u2019 Darko Mihelic hiked his price target for Bank of Nova Scotia (TSX:BNS) to $86 from $80 after the bank reported lower than expected PCLs and \u201cbetter than expected net interest income.\u201d Mihelic expects earnings growth to improve in 2026, \u201cdriven by total revenues and lower PCLs rather than strong loan growth.\u201d\nBank of Montreal\nMihelic also hiked his target price for Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO) to $168 from $161. The stock is trading around $165. Mihelic said it appears that PCLs have \u201cpeaked\u201d in the U.S., with RBC lowering its assumptions in that area. He also gave a thumbs up to the bank\u2019s repurchase and cancellation of shares as \u201ca solid signal of usage of excess capital,\u201d he said in a note.\nNational Bank of Canada\nNational Bank of Canada (TSX:NA) was an outlier among the Big Six, missing estimates on earnings per share, with TD analyst Mendonca citing as the cause lower trading revenues and dilution of shares from issuance related to the purchase of Canadian Western Bank. Mendonca did note however that gains from that deal have yet to be realized. He lowered his price target to $148, from $152. National is currently trading around $145.\nDollarama a \u2018core Canadian consumer holding\u2019\nThe Montreal-based discount retailer Dollarama Inc. (TSX:DOL) is on a roll, with BMO Capital Markets analyst Etienne Ricard viewing the company as a \u201ccore Canadian consumer holding\u201d while maintaining a price target of $215. The stock is currently trading around $187. Dollarama reported growth this week from its expansions into Australia and Mexico, while executives noted that shoppers showed signs during the quarter of both resilience and fragility. \u201cWhile DOL highlighted an \u2018inconsistent\u2019 consumer for general merchandise and seasonal items, DOL has nonetheless exceeded expectations year to date without meaningful growth contributions from these,\u201d Ricard said in a note. Brian Morrison at TD Securities has a price target of $210 on the stock and said in a note that the chain\u2019s prospects in Mexico and Australia help support \u201cits admittedly \u2018rich\u2019 valuation.\u201d\nBRP weathers higher rates, tariff uncertainty\nThe maker of Sea-Doos and Ski-Doos ran into rough weather on higher interest rates and after tariff uncertainty sapped demand, but analysts at TD Securities now think BRP Inc. (TSX:DOO) might be through the worst of its downturn after the Montreal-based manufacturer beat estimates. Brian Morrison at TD raised his price target to $106 from $87, which he had already hiked in mid-August from an earlier target of $70. \u201cExpect upward consensus revisions (on the stock price) despite the \u2018soft\u2019 retail environment,\u201d he said in a note. He thinks BRP shares will get their next leg up from lower interest rates.\n\u2022 Email: gmvsuhanic@postmedia.com\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

The nation\u2019s investors seemingly never got the memo.\nCanadian investors have injected $124 billion into U.S. stocks in 2025, even as Trump\u2019s trade war disrupted the two countries\u2019 longstanding, largely tariff-free relationship, according to data compiled by Warren Lovely at National Bank of Canada Financial Markets. That\u2019s on track for the largest yearly inflow since at least the 1990s.\nCanadian investors can\u2019t seem to resist the lure of the U.S. market, which has outperformed the domestic benchmark in each of the past two years. Pinpointing the exact reason for this year\u2019s enthusiasm \u2014 when the relations between the two countries have grown more tense \u2014 is a tricky proposition. But optimism over an artificial intelligence frenzy that\u2019s pushed U.S. tech titans to multiple records looms large.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of performance chasing,\u201d said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Vancouver-based PenderFund Capital Management Ltd. He pointed to years of U.S. market outperformance, thanks to the rise of AI and inflows into mega-cap tech stocks.\nThis year, Canadian shares have proven the better bet. Canada\u2019s benchmark index has outperformed its US peer, with the S&P/TSX Composite Index climbing almost 15 per cent, compared with a 10 per cent gain in the S&P 500 Index.\nStill, locals have \u201cseemingly failed to employ a \u2018buy Canadian\u2019 (or \u2018sell American\u2019) philosophy in their own portfolio dealings,\u201d Lovely, managing director at the firm, wrote in a note to clients last week. He was describing the trend he has tracked over the course of 2025, a time when U.S. liquor has been pulled off Canadian store shelves and cross-border tourism has dwindled. Lovely called the figures \u201crather stunning.\u201d\nThe buying spree contradicts a poll from July showing that Canadians want their pension fund managers to reduce holdings of U.S. assets. Sun Life Financial Inc., one of the largest workplace pension plan providers in Canada, said that Trump\u2019s tariff war earlier this year did push some local investors to rotate their portfolios away from U.S. assets.\n- U.S. stocks extend slide\n- Investors are frogs in a Trumpian pot\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nThe Canadian benchmark hit its 30th record high for the year on Friday on signs of de-escalation in the trade war with the U.S. Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday the country would remove its retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. in an olive branch to Trump.\nTaylor, who helps oversee $3 billion for PenderFund Capital Management, said he\u2019s got a preference for Canadian and European equities right now. He said they look more attractive than U.S. stocks after a multi-year run of outperformance.\n\u201cThe U.S. market is looking really crowded and stretched right now,\u201d Taylor said.

      "text": "5 reasons investors like dividends\nPeter Hodson: From company stability to \u2018lazy\u2019 investing, the reasons investors take to dividends have a psychological component\nFor decades, there has been debate on whether dividends are good for investors. The arguments against a company paying dividends are strong: Dividends are paid with after-tax earnings so paying a dividend leaves less capital in a company; a company growing at 20 per cent or more can re-invest capital and see huge compounding growth versus giving investors cash where they might earn two per cent (and see that income taxed). Famous investors such as Warren Buffett refuse to pay dividends, yet are content to receive them from their company investments.\nThis week we are going to ignore the academic argument and focus on the psychological and soft benefit of dividends. As investment strategists we certainly know that investors like dividends, whether they make sense for a company to pay them or not. Let\u2019s examine five points regarding this.\nDividends get you back to the basics\nIn today\u2019s high-speed investment environment, and with trading platforms that have used gamification features such as Robinhood Financial, it is surprising how many investors do not really know what they are buying. Many don\u2019t even care, as long as it goes up, as evidenced by the meme-stock trades that pop up \u2014 and crash \u2014 every now and then. Dividends can help remind investors what they actually own: a portion, however small, of an actual operating company. Owning shares means you are an owner of a company. As an owner, you should be entitled to some of the profits, and this is exactly what dividends are. Knowing this, you might be inclined to keep your shares longer, if the company is doing well. It can help an investor ascertain the difference between company performance and stock performance, as we are sure you are aware that these two factors often diverge.\n- 5 things it would take to get small cap stocks moving again\n- 5 things in markets that will make you do a double-take\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nDividend stocks can be less volatile\nCompanies that pay regular dividends tend to be larger, well-established firms with stable cash flows and solid balance sheets, which help buffer their share prices against large swings. The cash flow from regular dividends offers investors a reliable return even if share prices fluctuate, making such stocks less susceptible to panic selling during downturns. Dividend-paying companies are often found in defensive sectors, which are less sensitive to economic cycles, further contributing to their lower volatility.\nInvestors see dividend stocks as having higher valuations\nThis point is debatable. Most investors may believe that dividend stocks get higher valuations in the market but studies do not bear this out. Certain high-quality dividend growers (companies with a long history of increasing dividends) may receive valuation premiums, especially in low-interest-rate or uncertain economic environments, but this is not universally true. We think the investor belief here comes from the above point, that dividend stocks tend to be less volatile. So investors see them holding up better in a market downturn (which is true), and then naturally believe they are worth more in valuation terms (which they are not).\nThe psychological aspect of doing nothing and getting paid \u2018bonuses\u2019\nMy wife was a high-school math teacher until retiring last year. Once in a while she would coerce me into teaching a class about investment math. I often tried to get lazy teenagers interested in investments by appealing to the \u201cfree money\u201d aspect of dividends. Imagine: You sit on your couch playing video games and then money gets credited to your investment account while you do \u2026 absolutely nothing. Then, every once in a while, you get a \u201cbonus,\u201d as some companies pay special dividends on occasion. So now, with a special dividend, you get even more free money as a reward for sitting on the couch and being lazy. Dividends are amazing! Sometimes, these comments caused one or two students to wake up a bit. But teaching still remains a harder job than investments, in my view.\nManagement discipline\nWe think this is a valid point. A company that pays a regular dividend has to have cash flow available for the payout, every single quarter. Knowing that investors are expecting a dividend, executives of the company have to show discipline. They cannot just randomly go on an expansion or acquisition spree without consideration of the cash flow requirements of that dividend, every three months. When an executive team looks at deals, they need to consider the long-term consequences. Any deal needs to be financed properly in order to make sure the current dividend can be paid. Any deal needs to be a good deal so that it does not impair the company\u2019s dividend-paying ability in the future (and, preferably, allows the company to increase its dividend). Sure, non-dividend paying companies may have more capital available for growth, but this doesn\u2019t mean the expected growth is going to pan out. We think this point is particularly valid at economic peaks, when confidence and stock valuations are high. We have seen many executives go on spending sprees at the exact wrong time (in hindsight). Companies paying dividends just seem to have more self control during ebullient times.\nPeter Hodson, CFA, is founder of 5i Research Inc., an independent investment research network helping do-it-yourself investors reach their investment goals.
