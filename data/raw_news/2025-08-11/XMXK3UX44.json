The initiative has inspired dozens of businesses to contribute.\n\n\"It feels great to be able to give back to the community that's given to us to thrive and be bigger than what we are,\" Michael Conroy, owner of L&P Auto Repair in Parkside, said after dropping off a $1,000 check Monday morning.\n\nOther local businesses are stepping up, too.\n\n\"We do a lot of things for different schools we service,\" Penny O'Donnell, production manager at Barksdale School Portraits in Aston, said. \"So why not give back to the community that gives back to us?\"\n\nVinnie Vellucci, owner of Fight Shape in Broomall, donated $100 for the cause.\n\n\"I actually have some clients who come to the gym and their kids go to that school, so there's a connection that hits really close to home,\" Vellucci said. \"Delco's a tight-knit community, so it's always important to help out.\"\n\nAlong with the cards, Sculli has also collected items for raffle, including baseballs signed by Phillies All-Stars Trea Turner and Kyle Schwarber, donated by the MLB Players Association.\n\nSince the fire, Sculli's two daughters and other students have been learning in temporary spaces. Administrators said the school is expected to fully reopen in 2026.\n\n\"I think that'll definitely be a wonderful thing,\" Sculli said. \"It's something not just me, but all the families are really looking forward to.\"\n\nFor Sculli, the fundraiser is more than just a project. It's a personal mission to help restore a place that means so much to his family and community.",

      "text": "Students reunited for first time since St. Francis of Assisi School fire in Springfield, Pennsylvania\nIt's been almost three weeks since a fire destroyed an elementary school on the campus of Saint Francis of Assisi Parish. It was a devastating loss to the community, but it didn't stop students and staff from taking part in a cherished annual event on Friday.\nAbout 300 students participated in Dance-a-thon in the shadow of their burned-out school, which housed grades Pre-K, kindergarten, first and third grades. The event featured music, mini golf and even an inflatable slide.\n\"I like dancing because it's fun,\" first grader Emma Tansey said.\nAfter the fire on Oct. 7, the students were split up, with the younger kids taking classes at nearby Saint Kevin School and the older kids staying on campus. This was the first time since then that all of the students were back together.\n\"I'm happy to get back together with everyone,\" first grader Haley Comly said.\nIn previous years, Dance-a-thon raised money for various charities, but this year was different.\n\"We're trying to raise money to rebuild our school,\" fifth grader Matthew Caramanico said. \"It's a tradition we do every year but this year, we gotta make it extra special.\"\nPrincipal Nicole Hamilton said through Dance-a-thon, the school raised more than $46,000, but with all the donations over the last two weeks outside of the event, the total amount is closer to $100,000.\n\"Just a huge thank you to everyone,\" Hamilton said. \"Our entire community is beyond thankful for every donation, prayer, everything.\"\nThe rebuild could take years, but in the short term, the principal is hoping to set up modular classrooms so elementary and middle school students can be back on campus together.\n\"Everyone gets along really well,\" eighth grader Keira Geary said. \"The teachers are amazing here. All the students get along. I'm really close with all the students in all the grades. Everyone's just really close.\"\nThe school is more like a family and when times get tough, families stick together."

      "text": "St. Kevin School in Springfield, Pennsylvania, prepares to welcome St. Francis of Assisi students after fire\nSPRINGFIELD, Pa. (CBS) \u2013 Investigators are still working to figure out the cause of last week's fire at St. Francis of Assisi School in Springfield, Delaware County.\nThe Oct. 7 fire destroyed the building housing the lower grades of the school. Classes have been canceled for the last week and a half for those students. But preparations are underway to return to the classroom.\nNearby St. Kevin School is stepping in, offering nine classrooms to the 150 students affected. But some of these classrooms haven't been used in years.\nFrom the drilling and the toy sorting to the cleaning, it's all hands on deck to get the school ready. Even the little ones are doing their part.\n\"I was organizing everything,\" Salvatore, a 6-year-old student from St. Francis of Assisi School, said. \"So I can make the classroom look nice.\"\nStudents in the lower grades will go to St. Kevin starting Monday. Students in the upper grades already went back to class because their building wasn't damaged in the fire.\n\"We're hoping that in the next two months, we can get the school classroom modulars put on the St. Francis campus, so that way we can all be together,\" Nicole Hamilton, the principal of St. Francis of Assisi School, said. \"Being separate is not my goal at all.\"\nThe cafeteria at St. Kevin School is being used as a storage place for all the donations that St. Francis of Assisi School has received, from pencils and chalk to protractors and scissors.\n\"We were in a state of shock a week ago and the community has overwhelmed us with such love and happiness and support, that we are so grateful,\" Amy Travers, preschool teacher at St. Francis of Assisi School, said.\nTravers said she can't wait to see her students' faces when they walk into their temporary new classroom.\n\"I'm excited for the first day of school Monday,\" Travers said. \"I think it's going to be like the first day of school we had in September.\"\nShe's filled with gratitude as the work continues to return to normalcy."

      "text": "Fire destroys St. Francis of Assisi School in Springfield, Pennsylvania; classes canceled Tuesday\nA massive fire destroyed St. Francis of Assisi School in Springfield, Delaware County, on Monday. It happened at the campus building that housed pre-K, first and third-grade students, according to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.\nStudents in second grade and fourth to eighth grade at St. Francis of Assisi attend classes in another building on campus.\nThe fire started just after 5 p.m. at the school located on Saxer Avenue.\nIt's unclear how the fire started. The AOP said classes for all grades at St. Francis of Assisi School will be canceled Tuesday.\n\"We are deeply grateful to all fire departments and other first responders for their rapid response and for their work to control the blaze,\" the AOP said in a statement.\nThe Springfield Police Department said at around 9 p.m. that the scene at the school was still active and the area surrounding the fire would be closed through the night.\n\"We are on site at St. Francis for a fire at the school,\" the department wrote on X. \"This is an active scene. We ask our community members to please respect the work of the fire companies and first responders and keep away from the scene.\"\nNo injuries have been reported due to the blaze. Smoke billowed out from the school and near the St. Francis of Assisi church as firefighters worked to contain the fire.\nThe AOP said nobody was inside the school during the fire.\nAccording to the AOP, they're working to find another learning location for those affected by the fire.\n\"At this time, our concern is for the safety of the school community, the community-at-large, and working to provide continued instruction with as little interruption as possible,\" the AOP said in a release in part. \"We will make any other determinations at a later time pending all circumstances and information.\"\nThe community said St. Francis of Assisi School holds a special place in town.\n\"That's literally the heart of Springfield, like honestly, and to see the amount of people and the community come out and watch this happen and the devastation of it all, it was really upsetting,\" said Angela Jenkins, who lives across the street from the school.\nAs the neighborhood watched in disbelief, Bishop John McIntyre urged the community to pray for each other.\n\"Pray for the whole process as we get things back up on the ground and move forward,\" McIntyre said. \"I know how dedicated the people are to the parish and the parish school. It's a tremendous loss.\""
