  "content": "In a sweeping move aimed at rolling back pandemic-era mandates, the Trump administration on Friday directed all federal agencies to erase any records related to employees' COVID-19 vaccination status, prior mandate noncompliance or exemption requests.\n\nThe guidance, issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), was a response to recent litigation and is part of a broader push to reverse what officials have described as \"harmful pandemic-era policies\" imposed under the Biden administration.\n\n\"Things got out of hand during the pandemic, and federal workers were fired, punished or sidelined for simply making a personal medical decision,\" OPM Director Scott Kupor said in a statement. \"That should never have happened.

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

      "text": "FIRST ON FOX: Federal agencies are now required to protect religious expression in the workplace, according to a new government-wide memo obtained by Fox News Digital on Monday\u2014marking one of the most sweeping moves in decades to defend faith and freedoms in the civil service.\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on Monday sent guidance to federal agencies across the Trump administration, detailing the new requirements, which ensure federal workers can display Bibles, crucifixes, or mezuzahs on their desks; pray in groups while off-duty; invite colleagues to church; and speak about their religious beliefs, even to the public, without fear of reprisal.\nThe memo, titled \"Protecting Religious Expression in the Federal Workplace,\" was sent to agencies by OPM Director Scott Kupor on Monday, and obtained exclusively by Fox News Digital.\n\"Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,\" OPM Director Scott Kupor told Fox News Digital. \"This guidance ensures the federal workplace is not just compliant with the law but welcoming to Americans of all faiths.\"\nKupor added: \"Under President Trump\u2019s leadership, we are restoring constitutional freedoms and making government a place where people of faith are respected, not sidelined.\"\nIn the memo, Kupor details that the federal workforce \"should be a welcoming place for Federal employees who practice a religious faith.\"\n\"Allowing religious discrimination in the Federal workplace violates the law. It also threatens to adversely impact recruitment and retention of highly-qualified employees of faith,\" the memo states. \"The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution robustly protects expressions of religious faith by all Americans\u2014including Federal employees.\"\nKupor noted that freedom of religious expression is also protected by federal statutes, which \"prohibit the federal government from discriminating in employment based on religion or religious expression.\"\n\"This memorandum provides guidance to agencies on robustly protecting and enforcing each Federal employee\u2019s right to engage in religious expression in the Federal workplace consistent with the U.S. Constitution, Title VII, and other applicable sources of law,\" Kupor wrote in the memo. \"Agencies should allow personal religious expression by Federal employees to the greatest extent possible unless such expression would impose an undue hardship on business operations. And they should review and (if necessary) revise their internal policies to ensure that they appropriately protect religious expression.\"\nTRUMP TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDER ESTABLISHING WHITE HOUSE FAITH OFFICE\nKupor details examples of religious expressions that are permissible\u2014including employees keeping Bibles on their desk and reading it during breaks; keeping rosary beads or tefillin on their desks, and using those items to pray during breaks.\nKupor notes that agencies \"may restrict all posters, but an agency may not single out religious posters, such as those of a crucifix, a Bible verse, or a Star of David, for harsher treatment.\"\n\"An employee may wear a cross, as well as clothing displaying a religious message,\" Kupor wrote.\nKupor also detailed appropriate conversations between federal employees about religion.\n\"During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs. However, if the non-adherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honor the request,\" Kupor wrote. \"An employee may invite another to worship at her church despite being belonging to a different faith.\"\nINSIDE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S WHITE HOUSE FAITH OFFICE\nKupor added: \"On a bulletin board meant for personal announcements, a supervisor may post a hand-written note inviting each of his employees to attend an Easter service at his church.\"\nAs for expressions directed at members of the public, Kupor gave an example that \"a park ranger leading a tour through a national park may join her tour group in prayer,\" and \"a doctor at a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital may pray over his patient for her recovery.\"\nThe OPM memo comes following President Trump\u2019s executive orders on eradicating anti-Christian bias and establishing a Religious Liberty Commission.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe memo also builds on OPM's guidance from earlier this month on reasonable accommodations for religious purposes.\nTrump signed an executive order establishing a White House Faith Office in February.\nThe office empowers faith-based entities, community organizations and houses of worship \"to better serve families and communities,\" according to the White House.\nThe office is housed under the Domestic Policy Council and consults with experts in the faith community on policy changes to \"better align with American values.\""

      "text": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the Trump administration to move forward, at least for now, with plans to implement large-scale cuts to the federal workforce, issuing a stay that lifts a lower court\u2019s injunction against the administration\u2019s executive order.\nIn a 8-1 decision, the justices granted the emergency request filed by the White House last week, clearing the way for Executive Order No. 14210 to take effect while legal challenges play out in the Ninth Circuit and potentially the high court.\nThe order directs federal agencies to carry out sweeping reductions in force (RIFs) and agency reorganizations.\nIt has been described by administration officials as a lawful effort to \"streamline government and eliminate waste.\" Critics, including labor unions, local governments and nonprofit organizations, argue the president is unlawfully bypassing Congress to dismantle major parts of the federal government.\nFEDERAL APPEALS COURT THROWS ROADBLOCK AT TRUMP'S EDUCATION REFORM AGENDA\nA majority on the Court stressed that it was not ruling on the legality of specific agency cuts, only the executive order itself.\n\"Because the Government is likely to succeed on its argument that the Executive Order and Memorandum are lawful\u2014and because the other factors bearing on whether to grant a stay are satisfied\u2014we grant the application,\" the Court wrote. \"We express no view on the legality of any Agency RIF and Reorganization Plan produced or approved pursuant to the Executive Order and Memorandum. The District Court enjoined further implementation or approval of the plans based on its view about the illegality of the Executive Order and Memorandum, not on any assessment of the plans themselves. Those plans are not before this Court.\"\nThe district court in California had blocked the order in May, calling it an overreach. But the Supreme Court\u2019s unsigned decision on Tuesday set aside that injunction, pending appeal. The majority said the government is \"likely to succeed\" in defending the legality of the order.\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented forcefully, writing that \"this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President\u2019s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.\" She warned that the executive action represents a \"structural overhaul that usurps Congress\u2019s policymaking prerogatives\" and accused the majority of acting prematurely in an emergency posture without fully understanding the facts.\nTRUMP ADMIN ASKS SCOTUS TO ALLOW IT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH PLANS TO SLASH FEDERAL WORKFORCE\n\"This unilateral decision to \u2018transform\u2019 the Federal Government was quickly challenged in federal court,\" she wrote. \"The District Judge thoroughly examined the evidence, considered applicable law, and made a reasoned determination that Executive Branch officials should be enjoined from implementing the mandated restructuring\u2026 But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court\u2019s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President\u2019s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture.\"\nThe executive order, issued in February, instructed agencies to prepare immediate plans for reorganizations and workforce reductions, including eliminating roles deemed \"non-critical\" or \"not statutorily mandated.\" The administration says it is a necessary response to bloated government and outdated structures, claiming the injunction was forcing agencies to retain \"thousands of employees whose continuance in federal service... is not in the government and public interest.\"\nLabor unions and state officials opposing the plan say it goes beyond normal workforce management and could gut services across multiple agencies. They point to proposed cuts of over 50% at the Department of Energy, and nearly 90% at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\nThe court\u2019s ruling is not a final judgment on the legality of the executive order. It only determines that implementation may proceed temporarily while appeals continue. If the Ninth Circuit upholds the injunction or the Supreme Court declines to take up the case later, the order could again be paused.\nThe American Federal Government Employees Union had a forceful response: \"Today\u2019s decision has dealt a serious blow to our democracy and puts services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy. This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution. While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay safe and healthy.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe case is Trump v. American Federation of Government Employees.\n\"Today\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court ruling is another definitive victory for the President and his administration,\" wrote White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields in an email to Fox News Digital. \"It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President\u2019s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government.\""
