  "title": "Ukraine war latest: Zelensky seeks to push Putin \u2018to peace\u2019 on Kyiv Independence Day",
  "description": "Zelensky's remarks come as Russia and Ukraine exchanged 146 prisoners of war",
  "content": "Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to \u201cto push Russia to peace\u201d as Kyiv marked its Independence Day on Sunday.\n\nThe ceremony in Kyiv was attended by US envoy Keith Kellogg as Zelensky insisted that a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin is \u201cthe most effective way forward\u201d to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe commemoration of Ukraine\u2019s 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union came as Russia accused Kyiv of launching a massive drone attack that sparked fire at a nuclear power plant in the western Kursk region.\n\nMeanwhile, the US has been blocking Ukraine from firing long-range missiles into Russian territory for several months, according to new reports.\n\nThe move came after a fresh review mechanism brought in by the Pentagon in late spring, which effectively limits Kyiv\u2019s operational capabilities, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt has prevented Ukraine from striking using US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (Atacms), or British-produced Storm Shadows, both of which need US targeting data to be effective.\n\nZelensky has responded to the reports saying Ukraine has recently been using its own weapons and not consulting Washington over its strikes.\n\nRECAP: Lavrov says next steps 'depend on US' Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said the \u2018next steps\u2019 in repairing US-Russia relations depend on US leadership. In a post on Telegram, he stated: \u201cPresident #Putin: @realDonaldTrump & I had a very good, constructive & frank discussion in Alaska. \u201cI really hope the first steps made are just the beginning of a full-scale recovery of #RussiaUS relations. \u201cThe next steps depend on the US leadership.\u201d Ukraine has revealed its plans to move ahead with a new cruise missile that would have the ability to strike deep into Russian territory. The Flamingo FP-5 missile can carry a warhead weighing more than one tonne, and can fly more than 3,000 kilometres. Manufactured by Ukraine\u2019s Fire Point defence company, the missile is reportedly faster than any the country currently use and took just nine months to develop. US vice president JD Vance has insisted Donald Trump will be the one to bring an end to war in Ukraine as he praised his \u201cenergetic diplomacy\u201d. In remarks made on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press Sunday, Vance told Kristen Welker both sides had shown openness to accepting \u201csignificant concessions\u201d in recent days. He added Trump would be willing to pile the pressure onto one side if necessary. Earlier this week, the US president said he would \u201csee whose fault it is\u201d before taking further action towards peace talks. Vance boasts Trump will end Ukraine war while Russia stalls on talks with Zelensky Vance insists Russia made \u2018significant\u2019 concessions -- but can\u2019t name them -- as Russia\u2019s foreign minister walks back claim of Zelensky meeting within \u2018two weeks\u2019 Belarusian president says he is healthy after physical examination Veteran Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, said that he had undergone the first physical of his life and was found to be in good health. Questions have periodically been raised about Lukashenko's health in the past few years \"Recently, for the first time in my life, I underwent a complete physical over two days,\" Lukashenko, 70, told journalists on Belarusian television in comments posted on his Pul Pervogo Telegram channel. \"Goodness knows what they didn't do to me. They even got into my brain. They x-rayed every bit of me... Touch wood, I am happy. Everything is normal.\" Doubts about his health intensified during a visit to Moscow in 2023 on the anniversary of the 1945 Soviet victory over Nazi Germany during which he missed events, appeared unsteady and failed to make an address. Lukashenko said even intelligence services from nations friendly to Belarus had inquired about his health. \"I am saying that I am ok with that,\" he said. \"Hand over the test results, those examinations and let them be published.\" In power since 1994, Lukashenko allowed Putin to use his country's territory to launch the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but has said he will play no direct role in the conflict. RECAP: Putin says Trump is 'light at the end of the tunnel' for US-Russia relations Russian leader Vladimir Putin praised US President Donald Trump as the \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d after decades of strained relations between the two countries. His remarks came after the two met in Alaska in a high-stakes summit that failed to see any significant progress made towards peace in Ukraine. Putin fawns over Trump as 'light at the end of tunnel' Ukrainians living in UK fear war will 'never end' Ukrainians living in the UK have said they are scared the war will \u201cnever end\u201d after peace talks between the US and Russia ended uneventfully. Monika Popadiuk, who moved to the UK from Kyiv in July 2022, said she was \u201cafraid of losing everything a second time\u201d if the conflict is not brought to an end. Ukrainians in the UK fear war will never end after Trump-Zelensky meeting \u2018Unless Ukraine is given real security guarantees, the war will resume,\u2019 warn citizens who fled the country when Russia invaded Russia's air defence units destroyed two drones flying towards Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of the Russian capital said this morning. \"Emergency services are working at the site where the debris fell,\" Sobyanin said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Zelensky: 'The end of the war means a guarantee of peace in Ukraine' Speaking in Kyiv on Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day, Zelensky said the end of the war would mean a \u201cguarantee of peace\u201d for Ukraine. \"We are all working to ensure that the end of this war would mean the guarantee of peace for Ukraine, so that neither war nor the threat of war are left for our children to inherit,\" Zelensky told a crowd of dignitaries in Kyiv's Sophia Square. Zelensky has previously said he wants future security guarantees as part of a potential peace deal to be as close as possible to NATO's Article 5, which considers an attack on one member state as an attack against all. Support has poured in for Ukraine and President Zelensky on Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day. Posting on X, Zelensky shared dozens of letters and posts from foreign leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Mark Carney. RECAP: Report claims US has blocked Ukraine from using long-range missiles in Russia The US has reportedly been blocking Ukraine from using long-range missiles in Russia, according to the Wall Street Journal. Both US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (Atacms) and British-produced Storm Shadows depend on US targeting data. A new review process brought in by Washington in late spring has blocked Ukraine from using Atacms at least one, the report claimed. In response, Zelensky said Kyiv had recently been using its own weapons and not consulting with Washington over strikes.",

foreign minister walks back claim of Zelensky meeting within \u2018two weeks\u2019\nJohn Bowden in Washington, D.C.\nMonday 25 August 2025 05:37 BST\nZelensky praises Ukraine's courage in face of Russian invasion on Independence Day\nSign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email Get our free Inside Washington email Vice President JD Vance has touted his boss\u2019s \u201cenergetic diplomacy\u201d with Russia, and insisted that the Trump administration would bring the three-year-long war between Ukraine and Russia to an end.\nBut as his remarks aired on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press Sunday, Russia\u2019s top diplomat was making that prospect look unlikely \u2014 while walking back progress made between Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Volodymyr Zelensky and a host of European leaders in a whirlwind series of meetings over the past two weeks.\nVance told NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker, in a pre-taped interview, that both sides had signaled their openness to accepting \u201csignificant concessions\u201d in recent days, and said that the president was open to increasing pressure if one side was seen as an obstacle to peace.\n\u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe sometimes feel like we\u2019ve made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he\u2019s been very frustrated with the Russians. We\u2019re going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close.\u201d\nHe added that Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin \u201cmade significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in 3 \u00bd years of this conflict\u201d during his summit with Trump on August 15 in Anchorage, Alaska.\nJD Vance insisted that Donald Trump would be able to pressure Russia into reaching a peace agreement with Ukraine in an interview aired Sunday (NBC News) \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They\u2019ve talked about what would be necessary to end the war,\u201d said the vice president.\nHe was unable to name specific areas where the Trump administration was making progress, however, as Russian and U.S. officials have given different interpretations of what was agreed upon at the Alaska summit.\nBut the two concessions named by U.S. officials in the wake of that summit -- a Ukrainian security guarantee and the prospect of a meeting between Zelensky and Putin within two weeks -- now both seem on the edge of disappearing, if they haven\u2019t already collapsed.\nRussia\u2019s top envoy, Sergey Lavrov, appeared separately Sunday on Meet the Press and said that no Putin-Zelensky meeting was on the table in the immediate term.\n\u201cPutin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy when the agenda is ready for a summit, and this agenda is not ready at all,\u201d Lavrov said.\nThe Russian diplomat\u2019s comments come as Donald Trump confirmed Friday that he informed Putin that he was \u201cnot happy\u201d about a Russia strike against a factory in Ukraine this past week that is owned by a U.S. company. The attack in the town of Mukachevo, which injured at least 15 people, was part of a larger wave of Russian airstrikes.\nOn his Sunday appearace, Lavrov proceeded to denounce the Ukrainian president and claimed that Zelensky was refusing to accept that Ukraine would be blocked from joining NATO under a peace agreement.\n\u201cIt was very clear to everybody that there are several principles which Washington believes must be accepted, including no NATO membership, including the discussion of territorial issues, and Zelensky said no to everything,\u201d said Lavrov.\n\u201cHe even said no to, as I said, to canceling legislation prohibiting the Russian language. How can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?\u201d\nEuropean leaders who met with Trump at the White House Monday touted the brokering of that potential Zelensky-Putin sitdown as a major development in the peace process.\nRussia\u2019s recognition of the ability of Ukraine to sign security guarantees with the U.S. and other European nations similarly was seen as a major concession, but the Kremlin reportedly dismissed the prospect of troops from NATO countries on the ground in Ukraine after the U.S. president\u2019s meeting with Zelensky.\nTrump\u2019s own press secretary confirmed this past week that the White House would not consider deploying troops to Ukraine were it attacked again.\nThank you for registering Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "Inside the Ukrainian factory building drones and cruise missiles to strike Russia\nWith limited military assistance from Western allies, Ukraine has fast become a global center for defense innovation\nA Ukrainian-made drone attack on a Russian ammunition depot last September demonstrated Kyiv\u2019s ability to strike deep behind enemy lines, a feat particularly gratifying for Iryna Terekh, head of production at Fire Point.\nHer company manufactured the drones that flew over 1,000 kilometres (620 miles), subsequently curtailing Russia\u2019s devastating glide bomb attacks on her native city of Kharkiv.\nIryna Terekh, head of production at Fire Point, highlighted aerial warfare for Ukraine, stating: \"Fighting in the air is our only real asymmetric advantage on the battlefield at the moment.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have as much manpower or money as they have.\"\nHer comments came as she surveyed dozens of \"deep-strike drones\" from the assembly line, destined for Ukrainian forces to target Russian military and economic sites.\nDriven by its existential struggle against Russia and constrained Western aid, Ukraine has rapidly become a global hub for defence innovation. The nation aims to match, if not outmuscle, Russia\u2019s capabilities, with Fire Point leading the way.\nThe Associated Press was granted an exclusive look inside one of Fire Point\u2019s dozens of covert factories.\nIn a sprawling warehouse where rock music blared, executives showed off their signature FP-1 exploding drones that can travel up to 1,600 kilometers (994 miles).\nThey also touted publicly for the first time a cruise missile they are developing that is capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles), and which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hopes will be mass-produced by the end of the year.\nEven as US President Donald Trump presses for an end to the war \u2014 and dangles the prospect of US support for NATO-like security guarantees \u2014 Ukrainian defense officials say their country is determined to become more self-sufficient in deterring Russia.\n\u201cWe believe our best guarantee is not relying on somebody\u2019s will to protect us, but rather our ability to protect ourselves,\u201d said Arsen Zhumadilov, the head of the country's arms procurement agency.\nUkraine's government is now purchasing about $10 billion of weapons annually from domestic manufacturers. The industry has the capacity to sell triple that amount, officials say, and they believe sales to European allies could help it reach such potential in a matter of years.\nDrone innovation grew out of necessity\nLike most defense companies in Ukraine, Fire Point grew out of necessity after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Despite pleas from Ukrainian military officials, Western countries were unwilling to allow Kyiv to use their allies' longer-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory.\nThat's when a group of close friends, experts from various fields, set out to mass-produce inexpensive drones that could match the potency of Iranian-made Shahed drones that Russia was firing into Ukraine with devastating consequences.\nThe company's founders spoke with AP on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their safety and the security of their factories.\nBy pooling together knowledge from construction, game design and architecture, the company's founders \u2014 who had no background in defense \u2014 came up with novel designs for drones that could fly further and strike with greater precision than most products already on the market.\nTheir long-range drones had another benefit: they did not need to take off from an air field.\nWhen Terekh \u2014 an architect \u2014 was hired in the summer of 2023, she was given a goal of producing 30 drones per month. Now the company makes roughly 100 per day, at a cost of $55,000 apiece.\nThe FP-1 looks more like a hastily made science project than something that would roll off the production lines of the world's biggest defense contractors. \u201cWe removed unneeded, flashy glittery stuff,\u201d she said.\nBut the FP-1 has been extremely effective on the battlefield.\nWith a payload of explosives weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds), it is responsible for 60 per cent of strikes deep inside Russian territory, including hits on oil refineries and weapons depots, according to Terekh.\nThese strikes have helped to slow Russia\u2019s advance along the 1,000 kilometer-long (620 mile-long) front line in eastern Ukraine, where army units have reported a sharp decline in artillery fire.\n\u201cI think the best drones, or among the best, are Ukrainian drones,\" said Claude Chenuil, a former French military official who now works for a trade group that focuses on defense. \u201cWhen the war in Ukraine ends, they will flood the market.\u201d\nUkraine is becoming the \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 of defense\nFire Point\u2019s story is not entirely unique. Soon after Russia's 2022 invasion, hundreds of defense companies sprouted almost overnight.\nThe Ukrainian government incentivised innovation by relaxing regulations and making it easier for startups to work directly with military brigades.\nPatriotic entrepreneurs in metallurgy, construction and information technology built facilities for researching and making weapons and munitions, with an emphasis on drones.\nThe ongoing war allowed them to test out ideas almost immediately on the battlefield, and to quickly adapt to Russia\u2019s changing tactics.\n\u201cUkraine is in this very unique moment now where it is becoming, de facto, the Silicon Valley of defense,\u201d said Ukrainian defense entrepreneur Yaroslav Azhnyuk. \u201cThe biggest strategic asset that we have is that we have been at war with Russia for 11 years.\u201d\nA case in point: Fire Point had initially sourced navigational equipment for its drones from a major Western firm, but before long Russia was able to disrupt their effectiveness using electronic warfare; so Fire Point developed its own software to outwit the enemy.\nBecause defense companies are high-value targets for Russia, many operate underground or hidden within civilian centers to evade detection.\nAlthough they are guarded by air defenses, the strategy has the disadvantage of putting civilians at risk.\nMany Ukrainians have died in imprecise Russian attacks that were likely targeting weapons facilities. Entrepreneurs said the alternative is to operate openly and face attacks that would set back the war effort.\nSupplies of drones don't last long\nOn the day AP reporters visited the Fire Point factory, there were dozens of drones awaiting delivery. They would all be gone within 72 hours, shipped to the battlefield in inconspicuous cargo trucks.\nThe Fire Point team receives regular feedback from army units, and the company has reinvested most profits toward innovating quickly to keep pace with other drone makers. Increasingly, those profits are being directed to develop a new, more potent weapon.\nThe company completed testing this year for its first cruise missile, the FP-5. Capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) and landing within 14 meters (45 feet) of its target, the FP-5 is one of the largest such missile in the world, delivering a payload of 1,150 kilograms (2,535 pounds), independent experts said.\nBecause initial versions of the missile came out pink after a factory error, they called it the Flamingo \u2014 and the name has stuck.\nFire Point is producing roughly one Flamingo per day, and by October they hope to build capacity to make seven per day, Terekh said.\nEven as Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials pursue ways to end the war, Terekh said she is skeptical that Russia will accept terms for a real peace. \u201cWe are preparing for a bigger, much scarier war.\u201d"

      "text": "What is the Storm Shadow cruise missile? Ukraine hits Russia with British weapon for first time\nThe missile has a range of around 155 miles and is designed to evade detection by flying low after being launched\nUkraine is believed to have used British-made Storm Shdaow long-range missiles inside Russia for the first time.\nIt comes days after Joe Biden gave the green light for Ukraine to use US-made long-range missiles to target Vlasimir Putin\u2019s forces deep inside Russia, the first such missiles were used on Tuesday. That opened the door for Britain to do the same, with the UK missiles relying on US targeting programmes.\nIn a major policy shift just weeks before his tenure in office ends, the US president signed off on Ukraine\u2019s use of ATACMS missiles outside its own borders. This comes after months of refusing Kyiv\u2019s requests, which it said was crucial for its defences against Russia\u2019s invasion. Photographs circulating on Ukrainian and Russian social media suggest the UK missiles were inside the Kursk region near Russia\u2019s border, where Russian troops have been massing to try and reclaim territory Kyiv\u2019s forces took in a daring assault in the summer.\nStorm Shadow is an Anglo-French cruise missile with a maximum range of around 155 miles (250km). The French call it Scalp. After launch, the weapon, equipped with its navigation system, descends to a low altitude to avoid detection before locking on to its target using an infra-red seeker. On the final approach, the missile climbs to a higher altitude to maximise the chances of hitting the target.\nOn impact, it penetrates the target before a delayed fuse detonates the main warhead. Powered by a turbo-jet engine, the 1,300kg Storm Shadow travels at speeds of more than 600mph, is just over five metres long and has a wingspan of three metres.\nThe UK first confirmed it would supply Ukraine with Storm Shadow missiles in May last year, for use on Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Then defence secretary Ben Wallace had touted that the weapons would give Ukraine the \u201cbest chance\u201d of defending itself. Ukraine has deployed Storm Shadow missiles on several occasions during the war. In June last year, the then-defence secretary Ben Wallace told parliament that the missiles were already having a \u201csignificant impact on the battlefield\u201d.\nStorm Shadow missiles have also been used by British and French air forces in the Gulf, Iraq and Libya.\nCondemning president Mr Biden\u2019s decision, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated earlier warnings from Russian president Vladimir Putin saying that any strikes on Russian soil using US weapons would be interpreted as direct Nato involvement.\nAccording to Russia\u2019s Tass news agency, he said: \u201cIf such a decision has indeed been formulated and communicated to the Kyiv regime, then, of course, this is a qualitatively new round of escalation of tensions and a qualitatively new situation in terms of the involvement of the United States in this conflict.\u201d\nUntil now, long-range missiles have been limited to Russian targets operating inside Ukraine, as well as in occupied Crimea. The missiles were likely used in the largest Ukrainian attack on the headquarters of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol in Crimea last year.\nThe US, which has provided Ukraine with the longest-range version of the ATACMS, a ballistic missile capable of travelling 190 miles, has been cautious to fire long-range missiles into Russia for fear of a reaction from Moscow that would intensify the conflict. They are believed to be especially apprehensive that Russia may respond by deploying nuclear weapons.\nMr Biden changed his mind, US officials told The New York Times, after North Korea sent troops to support Mr Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking on Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not reference Mr Biden\u2019s decisions but denounced Western involvement in Ukraine and warned of the potential for \u201cWorld War III.\u201d\nVladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the Russian upper house\u2019s international affairs committee, also said Washington\u2019s decision could lead to world war.\nWashington\u2019s ATACMS decision is framed as being restricted to defending Ukrainian forces inside the Kursk region of Russia. In a surprise invasion in August, Ukraine took control of several communities in the Kursk border region, which it is currently defending against Russian counterattacks.\nThe shift in the final months of the Biden administration comes as Kyiv and Western allies prepare for a possible shift in US position under Donald Trump, who has said that he could terminate the war \u201cin a day\u201d.\nThe US has been the largest supplier of armaments to Ukraine. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research agency, it delivered or committed to deploy $55.5 billion (\u00a341.5 billion) in weaponry and equipment between the start of the war and the end of June 2024. Germany is Ukraine's second-largest military aid contributor behind the United States.\nThe decision will also put pressure on Germany to relent from its resistance to providing Ukraine with its long-range Taurus missiles, which Mr Zelensky has requested on numerous occasions. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has opposed such a move amid fears it could provoke a response from Russia.\nA spokesman for the German government said on Monday that Germany is continuing to hold to its decision to not send long-range missiles to Ukraine. The spokeswoman said, \"The chancellor's decision is unchanged,\" during a routine news conference in Berlin.\nFrance, which has given Ukraine its version of the Storm Shadow, indicated on Monday that it was open to letting Kyiv hit military targets within Russia.\n\"We openly said this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike a target from where Russia is currently aggressing Ukrainian territory. So nothing new on the other side,\" foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot told journalists ahead of an EU ministers' meeting in Brussels.\nKyiv has long lobbied for permission to hit deep inside Russian soil via western long-range missiles, given their ability to travel 150 miles and beyond. By contrast, the US-supplied Himars missiles currently used by Ukraine only have a range of around 50 miles."

The 28-year-old left her dream job as a lawyer in Ukraine\u2019s parliament and moved to rural Somerset under the British government\u2019s Homes for Ukraine scheme.\nLike many displaced Ukrainians, Ms Popadiuk desperately wants to go back to her old life in Kyiv. But she does not feel that will be possible in the near future, despite the meeting on Monday being hailed as \u201creal progress\u201d by prime minister Sir Keir Starmer.\n\u201cThe \u2018peace\u2019 people talk about does not feel like peace to me,\u201d she told The Independent. \u201cIt feels like just a pause. Unless Ukraine is given real security guarantees, the war will resume.\u201d\nShe is concerned that any peace talks between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders would only \u201cfreeze\u201d the war.\n\u201cIt does not seem that the Kremlin truly wants to end this war,\u201d she continued. \u201cEven if the war is frozen now, it will start again in a few months or years, when Russia is stronger than today.\u201d\nWhen it comes to Ukraine conceding territory, Ms Popadiuk thinks this will only serve to embolden Russia: \u201cThis looks very much like appeasement. History shows us that appeasement never stops aggressors. It only encourages them to continue.\u201d\nThree years on from the start of the Russian invasion, there are some young Ukrainians who have never even seen their own country.\nLiza Perebyynis\u2019s son was born in 2022, after Russia launched its full-scale assault on Ukraine, and he is now considered a \u201cchild of war\u201d.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know the war, but he would have this status,\u201d the 34-year-old said.\nThe boy is now three years old, and while he understands Ukrainian, he does not speak it. It pains his mother that she cannot show him her country while the war continues to rage.\nMs Perebyynis is from the Donbas region and left Ukraine in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea. She went to China at first, and later to Germany, where she has opened her own yoga studio. Monday\u2019s meeting, which also saw key European leaders hosted in Washington DC, was not a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in her view \u2013 it was merely history repeating itself.\nShe told The Independent: \u201cWe\u2019ve been there already. This conflict has not been happening since 2014 or 2022. It\u2019s been here for centuries. The territory has been back and forth.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been betrayed. Giving up territories now would mean the war will start again in three years or in five years.\u201d\nMs Perebyynis was disappointed by the coverage of Mr Zelensky\u2019s White House meeting, especially the \u201cabsurd\u201d focus on the Ukrainian president wearing a suit.\n\u201cAll of this feels more like a show with a red carpet and shaking hands,\u201d she said. \u201cZelensky wearing a suit was not the most important part.\n\u201cI was hoping for real politics, but I don\u2019t think any real decisions were made.\u201d\nTetiana Shcherban, 37, a Ukrainian entrepreneur in London, still goes back to Kyiv whenever she can to see her family.\n\u201cWhen you love something, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s dangerous or not,\u201d she said. \u201cI just need time to be there and feel that Ukrainian energy.\u201d\nShe came to the UK under the Ukraine family visa scheme and now splits her time between London and Kyiv. Before the war, Tetiana said she had \u201calmost the ideal life\u201d, then she had to \u201cstart from scratch\u201d when Russia invaded.\nWhile Ms Shcherban has a strong desire to return home more permanently, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the end. It may be an end to this chapter of the war, but not the end of Russia\u2019s plans.\n\u201cThe feeling of danger for Baltic countries will not finish right now. Russian propaganda still prevails. The ideas on which they built their army and this war movement will never stop existing.\u201d\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "ATACMS: The US-made long-range missiles Ukraine could use to strike Russia after Biden\u2019s green light\nShould Putin be afraid of Kyiv using Army Tactical Missile System rockets?\nJoe Biden has sensationally granted Kyiv permission to use \u201clong-range \u201c missiles to strike targets deep within Russia, despite Vladimir Putin describing such a move as an act of war.\nThe weapons are likely to be used in response to North Korea\u2019s decision to send thousands of troops to Russia in support of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and comes after months of pressure from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\nHe argued the US ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids.\nWe look closer at the weapons that could mark a turning point in the war.\nArmy Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) rockets\nThe first deep strikes are likely to be carried out using Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) rockets, which have a range of up to 190 miles (306 km), according to sources who revealed Biden\u2019s policy.\nATACMS are a long-range guided missile that gives operational commanders the \u201cimmediate firepower to win the deep battle\u201d.\nProduced by US global security and aerospace company Lockheed Martin, the missiles carry a 500lb (227kg) class blast fragmentation warhead.\nThese missiles can reach up to 300km (186 miles) and are tough to intercept due to their high speed.\nThe weapons are fitted with a specialised GPS system and carry cluster munitions.\nWhen fired, the clusters open in the air, releasing hundreds of bomblets rather than a single warhead.\nStorm Shadow\nUntil now the Storm Shadow missiles have been limited to Russian targets operating inside Ukraine, as well as in occupied Crimea. The missiles were likely used in the largest Ukrainian attack on the headquarters ofRussia\u2019s Black Sea fleet last year at Sevastopol.\nThe other missile being touted the British/French made Storm Shadow/SCALP-EG missile has a much longer estimated range of up to 550 km (340 miles).\nThe UK has supplied Ukraine with Storm Shadows, but hasn\u2019t allowed Ukraine to use them against Russian territory.\nManufacturer MBDA has said that the missile, which is fired from an aircraft, is designed to evade detection despite flying low after being launched.\nPowered by a turbo-jet engine, the 1,300kg Storm Shadow travels at speeds of more than 600mph, is just over five metres long and has a wingspan of three metres.\nAfter launch, the weapon, equipped with its own navigation system, descends to a low altitude to avoid detection before locking on to its target using an infra-red seeker.\nOn final approach the missile climbs to a higher altitude to maximise the chances of hitting the target.\nWhat did Putin warn if West let Ukraine use long-range missiles\nWashington\u2019s decision to let Ukraine strike deep into Russia with long-range U.S. missiles could lead to World War Three and will receive a swift response, Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of the Russian upper house\u2019s international affairs committee, said on Sunday, according to the TASS news agency.\nIf Ukraine is allowed to use long-range Western-provided missiles against targets inside Russia, it would mean the direct participation of Nato countries in the conflict, Vladimir Putin said on Thursday 12 September.\nWestern long-range precision weapons can only be used with intelligence data from Nato satellites and flight assignments entered by Nato military personnel, he claimed.\n\u201cTherefore, we are not talking about allowing the Ukrainian regime to strike Russia with these weapons or not. We are talking about making a decision about whether NATO countries are directly involved in the military conflict or not,\u201d Mr Putin said.\nHe added that the decision would change \u201cthe very nature of the conflict\u201d.\n\u201cThis will mean that Nato countries, the United States, and European countries are fighting against Russia.\u201d\nWill long-range missile strikes on Russia change the tide of war?\n\u201cThis is a very important decision for us,\u201d Serhii Kuzan, Chairman of the Kyiv-based think tank, the Ukrainian Security and Co-operation Centre, told the BBC.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that will change the course of the war, but I think it will make our forces more equal.\u201d\nMr Kuzan said the decision had come just in time to counter the expected start of a major assault by Russian and Korean troops, designed to dislodge Ukrainian forces from the Russian Kursk region.\nThe assault is expected within days.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this decision comes just in time. There are two days left,\u201d he tells me, adding that much depended on what quantities of missiles have already been provided to Ukraine and whether the US shares intelligence information to enable the missiles to be used to the greatest effect.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

The United States has imposed a review that restricts Ukraine\u2019s use of long\u2011range missiles such as ATACMS and Storm Shadow, citing concerns over targeting data and escalation, but Zelensky insists Ukraine is now using its own weapons. Russia has accused Kyiv of launching a drone attack that sparked a fire at a nuclear plant in Kursk, and Russian officials claim the next steps in US\u2011Russia relations depend on Washington\u2019s leadership.
