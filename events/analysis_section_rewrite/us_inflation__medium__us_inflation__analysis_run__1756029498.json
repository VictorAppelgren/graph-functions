      "feedback": "The draft shows good breadth and, importantly, ties AI productivity, labor-market dynamics, and private-market platforms (Pacaso, Mogul, Gameflip) to a plausible 3–6 month wake‑up path, but it needs a sharper, testable horizon map, tighter first‑principles grounding, and explicit, source‑backed numbers fitted to a 3–6 month window. Actionable edits: 1) replace the narrative with a formal 3–6 month catalyst map (base, bull, bear) that assigns each catalyst a timing window and a crisp trigger, e.g., Pacaso expanding to 10 destinations announced within month 1–3 (UPV3X2MQ6), Range’s AI-driven wealth tooling deployment and real-time insights (Range article fragment in UPV3X2MQ6), HeartSciences FDA/Medicare milestones (AUX: HeartSciences in UPV3X2MQ6), and UAS‑labour data signals (FOM34PUWA); annotate each with a reason and a minimum viable outcome. 2) hardwire invalidation rules: e.g., if Pacaso/Mogul deal flow stalls or price/valuation signals compress by month 4–6, if AI productivity uplift underwhelms ( Range 1–1.5% annual gains) or if wage/inflation pressures persist (A7VLN74BK), then pivot to an alternative scenario. 3) tighten the causal chain from macro to asset-plays: explain via a one‑paragraph logic: AI-driven productivity lifts potential output and lowers marginal costs ( Range cites 1–1.5% gains), which dampens inflation and enables data‑dependent easing; this flows into higher private-market appetite (Pacaso/Mogul/Gameflip) and selectively supports healthcare AI/tech‑enabled services (HeartSciences); simultaneously, global wage dynamics (BoJ/Ueda) are a cross‑current risk that can keep inflation sticky in some regions. 4) quantify base-case and alts with explicit numbers and source anchors: e.g., 1) private‑market growth signals: Pacaso’s 1.8T addressable vacation‑home market with 21% annual growth in top destinations; Mogul’s 18.8% IRR and 10–12% cash‑on‑cash with 12% bear‑hurdle; 2) health/AI cadence: 32B ECG market; Medicare reimbursement in 2025; FDA paths; 3) labor/tech: 97% UAS job rise, avg. US UAS salary ~$106k (FOM34PUWA); BoJ wage‑growth risk (A7VLN74BK). 5) reconcile conflicts with explicit note: AUVSI’s historical 100,000‑job forecast is defunct, but the contemporaneous Grand Forks data show a 97% rise in UAS jobs and a ~“$105k” average pay (FOM34PUWA); explicitly choose the 2025 signal and flag the older figure as a contextual backdrop. 6) strengthen first‑principles grounding by adding a concise “why now” box: productivity gains via AI are not a magic wand; they must materialize through adoption, complementarity with labor supply, and policy/coverage momentum (HeartSciences Medicare/FDA path; Range AI; ESG/robo-advisors in Benzinga pieces). 7) sharpen 1–2 alts beyond base: one scenario with accelerating AI productivity and favorable private-market liquidity; a second with stubborn wage/inflation persistence and tighter financing; 8) expand watch‑list signals and data cadence: AI productivity prints (Range), private‑market deal flow and quarterly updates from Pacaso/Mogul/Gameflip (UPV3X2MQ6), wage/inflation gauges (A7VLN74BK), UAS‑employment data (FOM34PUWA), and FDA/Medicare milestones for HeartSciences (A8 reference in UPV3X2MQ6). 9) polish style and citations: fix typos (e.g., “consumer-wuel” → “consumer demand”), ensure each factual claim tied to a specific ID, and clearly separate macro, policy, positioning, and flows lines so the transmission logic isn’t conflated. With these edits, the analysis will deliver a precise 3–6 month catalyst map, explicit invalidation points, defensible baselines and alt scenarios, rigorous use of quantified signals, and a coherent, source‑backed causal chain.",
