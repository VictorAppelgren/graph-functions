      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mapping** – The draft discusses U.S. 30‑year mortgage rates but never links the view to a canonical handle (e.g., `ust10y`, `dxy`, `spx`). Add a sentence that explicitly states: *“Mortgage rates are priced in the 6.5‑7.0 % band, which is roughly 0.5‑1.0 % above the current 10‑year Treasury yield (`ust10y`) as of 2025‑08‑27 (source: HYJA10SKI).”* This satisfies the mapping requirement.\n\n2. **Catalyst Window** – The draft references September 2024 Fed cuts but lacks a clear, dated catalyst window. Insert a clause: *“The structural break began in the September 2024 FOMC meeting (2024‑09‑16) and has persisted through the 2025‑08‑29 data release.”* This provides the required catalyst window.\n\n3. **Explicit Sign & Magnitude** – The draft mentions “6.5‑7.0 % range” but does not tie it to a sign/magnitude relative to the handle. Add: *“Mortgage rates are currently +0.5 % to +1.0 % above the 10‑year Treasury yield (`ust10y`), indicating a positive spread.”* Provide a numeric range and sign.\n\n4. **Citation Density & Correctness** – Replace vague references like “HYJA10SKI” with inline citations: `(HYJA10SKI, 2025‑08‑28)` and similarly for `LF0UUL917`. Ensure every substantive claim has a citation.\n\n5. **Remove Drift** – Sentences that drift from the core asset (e.g., “the real‑rate differential between the Fed’s policy rate and the 10‑year Treasury yield acting as a key transmission channel”) should be re‑framed to explicitly reference mortgage rates: *“The real‑rate differential between the Fed’s policy rate and the 10‑year Treasury yield (`ust10y`) directly influences mortgage spreads.”* If a sentence cannot be tied back, delete it.\n\n6. **Structure & Conciseness** – Condense the draft into a single paragraph that follows the required format: state direction, magnitude, horizon, catalysts, and invalidations. Example: *“Mortgage rates will likely stay in the 6.5‑7.0 % band through 2026‑27, driven by the 2024‑09‑16 Fed cuts and ongoing balance‑sheet contraction. A reversal would require a pause in QT or a more aggressive rate‑cut path. Watch the 2025‑09‑16 FOMC meeting and the 2025‑08‑27 10‑year Treasury yield for signals.”* Include inline citations.\n\nBy implementing these edits, the analysis will meet the acceptance gate (canonical handle + catalyst window), adhere to the concise, actionable style, and provide the required first‑principles grounding.",
