      "summary": "Wall Street faces potential volatility as a weak jobs report and looming CPI data raise concerns about tariff‑induced inflation and the timing of Fed rate cuts. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have surged to record highs, but elevated valuations and historically weak August/September performance suggest a pullback could be imminent. Market participants are betting on September Fed cuts, though higher CPI could delay easing and trigger a correction. Tariff increases on imports, especially semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, add further uncertainty to the U.S. economy and equity markets.",
