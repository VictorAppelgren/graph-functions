      "feedback": "**Actionable feedback (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Cite every substantive claim** – the draft currently relies on a single ID (FAN5RYW6T) for most assertions. Add inline citations for the July CPI (2.7 % y/y) and PCE (2.9 % y/y) from the same article, the September 5 payrolls report (historically weak employment growth in May‑July) and the Fed’s September meeting schedule. For the 5‑10 % decline range, reference a recent S&P 500 technical‑analysis source or a consensus forecast.  \n2. **Remove unsupported generalizations** – statements such as “high cost of capital will weigh on tech valuations” and “benefit would be muted if cuts are perceived as a response to a weakening economy” are not directly sourced. Either back them with a credible source (e.g., Fed policy statement or market‑watch commentary) or delete them.  \n3. **Use canonical handles and driver names** – replace generic terms with the naming convention: spx (S&P 500), fed_policy (Fed policy), us_cpi (U.S. CPI), us_pce (U.S. PCE), us_employment (U.S. employment), us_tariffs (U.S. tariffs), us_tech_earnings (U.S. tech earnings).  \n4. **Specify catalyst windows** – clearly state the September 5 payrolls release, July CPI/PCE releases, Q3 earnings season (mid‑Q3), and the Fed’s September policy meeting as the key 3‑6‑month triggers.  \n5. **Quantify the scenarios** – keep the base case at a 5‑7 % spx decline, alt 1 at a 2‑4 % decline if inflation eases faster, alt 2 at an 8‑12 % decline if Fed cuts but tech earnings stay weak.  \n6. **Clarify watch‑list signals and invalidations** – list the Fed meeting outcome, CPI/PCE readings, payrolls data, and Q3 tech earnings as watch signals; note that a positive surprise in any of these invalidates the pullback thesis.  \n7. **Maintain the 3‑6‑month horizon** – ensure all time references (e.g., “next 3‑6 months”) are explicit.  \n8. **Keep the paragraph concise** – trim redundant phrasing and focus on the causal chain: concentration → tech earnings → Fed policy → inflation/tariffs → labor market → spx movement.  \n\nImplement these edits to meet the truth‑over‑verbosity, market‑mapped, and actionable standards required for a top‑macro PM review.",
