      "summary": "The International Court of Justice released a non‑binding advisory opinion on July 23 that declares developed countries have a legal duty to reduce greenhouse‑gas emissions and may owe reparations to affected states. While the ruling provides a legal framework that climate activists can cite in future litigation, the Court’s lack of enforcement power and the muted response from world leaders mean the opinion is unlikely to change policy immediately. The opinion could spur a wave of climate‑related lawsuits and influence national courts, but its impact will depend on how states incorporate its principles into domestic law. Meanwhile, the upcoming COP30 in Brazil is already marred by infrastructure projects that undermine the summit’s environmental goals, illustrating the gap between rhetoric and action.",
