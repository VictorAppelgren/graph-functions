  "description": "Razer's upgraded Wolverine V3 controller might be the first one to make full use of TMR thumbsticks",
  "content": "Razer is tripling down on the success of its Wolverine V3 Pro controller, and I think even that might be underselling it. The brand is coming out with an updated version of what is already one of the best PC controllers on the shelves, this time, with TMR thumbsticks and a ludicrous 8K polling rate.\n\nThe original Razer Wolverine V3 Pro launched late in 2024 as an officially licensed Xbox controller. Later, the brand put out a more affordable Tournament Edition, which took out the wireless connectivity and a few extra frills. We've now seen a mobile version of the same controller, the Kishi V3 Pro, and now, the Razer Wolverine V3 8K is arriving on the shelves. Costing $199 at Amazon in the US, and \u00a3179.99 at Amazon in the UK, it removes the Xbox licensing and takes aim directly at PC players.\n\nThe 8K version will be able to reach an 8,000Hz polling rate when in wired or wireless mode, which trounces the original V3 Pro's 1,000Hz maximum. When I first saw the news, it was hard not to think this was slight overkill. The fastest controllers in this day and age have polling rates of up to 1,000Hz, and even though mice and keyboards get infinitely higher speeds, I personally haven't exactly noticed a difference in latency when using them in most games. Hell, the Xbox Series X can only make use of a 400Hz polling rate for its controllers, and while I have no problem with bringing speeds up to modern standards, plenty of people on that platform get by just fine without feeling like their latency is killing their gameplay.\n\nBut the more I thought about it, the more I realised why an 8K polling rate is going to be a massive win. I've actually been waiting for a PC controller that would unlock this sort of polling rate, and it has nothing to do with latency. Yes, it finally brings controllers in line with a lot of mice and keyboards, but the real benefit is that it fully unlocks the capability of TMR thumbstick technology.\n\nIf you haven't been keeping up, TMR thumbsticks are an advancement of Hall sensors. They're immune to stick drift, yes, but the real win here is that they can register a much, much higher resolution when it comes to stick positioning. All the while, they can relay those inputs at a vastly higher polling rate that so far, just hasn't been catered to by controllers which max out at 1,000Hz. So, Razer's new Wolverine V3 Pro 8K has the potential to really let its thumbsticks rip like no other.\n\nWhen I've had my hands on any controller with TMR sticks, it's been absolute bliss in first-person shooters. Hall sensors are great on their own, but with TMR sticks, I feel like every small aiming adjustment is exactly what I wanted to input, and going back to potentiometers or even Hall sticks is when you really start to notice the difference.\n\nAs you may have guessed, Razer is following up with a more affordable Tournament Edition for this controller as well. It'll set you back $119.99 at Amazon in the US, and \u00a399.99 in the UK. Like the original Wolverine V3 TE before it, it removes the wireless support and swappable thumbstick tops, but still gives you access to the main features and design flourishes of the full-fat model.\n\nThose include six extra mappable buttons, Esports mouse microswitches, swappable thumbsticks, a case, and a 2m braided cable. Those who opt for the TE won't get the case either.\n\nI'm very excited to get my hands on this controller to test out the differences between the Xbox V3 Pro. When I reviewed that pad, I awarded it with four stars, and it appears on both our Xbox and PC controller buying guides as the \"best for speed\" - I guess Razer took that in stride.\n\nYou might also want to read about the best PS5 controllers, the best Xbox Series X controllers, and the best Nintendo Switch controllers.",

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nThe Razer Wolverine V3 TE really doesn\u2019t miss out on much compared to its expensive Pro sibling. That\u2019s great because it amounts to a Tournament Edition that costs $100 and still gets you the speedy, brilliant redesign of this brand\u2019s best controller. If you can do without wireless connectivity, a carry case, and a few extra frills, this may be the controller for you.\nPros\n- +\nSame great controller as the V3 Pro\n- +\nLots of extra buttons\n- +\nSpeedy design\n- +\nMore reasonable price\n- +\nSolid build quality\nCons\n- -\nLack of attachments\n- -\nGrips are short\n- -\nNo wireless connectivity\n- -\nThe plastic grips can be hard on your skin\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nI was a bit reluctant to review the Razer Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition to begin with. At the start of the year, I reviewed the Pro model of this controller after a good few months of playtesting it, and with so few differences between it and the more affordable Tournament version, I didn\u2019t see all that much need to revisit it. However, I\u2019m now glad I did since the V3 TE makes a serious argument for itself, and it might be all the pro controller you need in 2025.\nOf course, you will need to give up any dreams of wireless play, which may or may not have been drawing you to the newer range of Xbox Series X controllers in the first place. It\u2019ll really be up to you whether that\u2019s a deal breaker, or whether budget is going to take decisions out of your hands.\nThe Tournament Edition costs $99.99 / \u00a399.99, which feels a lot more reasonable than the V3 Pro\u2019s price tag of $199 / \u00a3199. That\u2019s a rather large disparity in price for a wireless dongle and a few extras, so it really calls into question how much you want to play without a cable in the way. If wiring up isn\u2019t out of the question, you might be getting one hell of a deal.\nDesign & Features\nHaving already fully reviewed the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, and with the Tournament Edition sharing almost all of the same traits, I\u2019ll spare a lot of the nitty-gritty details here. My summary of the Wolverine V3\u2019s design and features in the full-fat review also applies to this more affordable version, so if you want to know more, give that review a read.\nEssentially, the Wolverine V3 reworks one of this brand\u2019s most popular gamepad ranges. Previous Wolverines proved to be popular for competitive play, and for those who wanted the highest number of extra buttons on the market. That was very much the Wolverine range\u2019s big selling point, but in many ways, it felt like Razer was perfectly comfortable letting it coast on that accolade alone. Previous Wolverines felt like a jumble of great features, haphazardly integrated into a PC controller. The Wolverine V3 takes those parts, responds to a lot of the criticisms that were levied at older versions, and organizes its features into a coherent, speedy, and excellent product.\nThe main design point to speak of here is that Razer has used mechanical switches taken straight from one of its Esports mice in an attempt to maximize the speed that controllers are capable of. This makes the Wolverine V3 Pro and TE very clicky indeed, so if you aren\u2019t a fan of microswitch buttons and prefer a more traditional, membrane button feel, you\u2019ll probably want to save your hard-earned dosh and spend it elsewhere. This is a controller that\u2019s been designed around speedy actuation, and it achieves that in spades.\nBut what are the differences between the Razer Wolverine V3 TE and its pricier alternative? As mentioned, the big draw of the Pro model is that you get a USB wireless dongle to let you play untethered, but with the TE you\u2019ll also miss out on a carrying case and attachments. Personally, I like that the V3 Pro was the first of Razer\u2019s pads to ship with a case since that was one area where it fell behind versus other manufacturers. But the lack of a case in the Tournament model means you can\u2019t swap out the thumbstick tops for taller or shorter ones. This is a bigger bummer for me than not having a case, especially since the word \u201cTournament\u201d would still suggest this controller provides some customization for competitive play. Furthermore, the rubberized, textured grips on the Pro model are missing here too, resulting in a slightly cheaper feel that reminds me a bit of the Razer Wolverine V2 Pro for PS5. If you\u2019re a fan of the Razer RGB Chroma lighting on that model, you\u2019ll be sad to learn it isn\u2019t included here either.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nPerformance\nI didn\u2019t realize it when testing, but the Wolverine V3 Pro left quite an impression on me. It reset the bar for any controller trying to achieve speedy actuation and has become my natural point of comparison ever since playing with it. The microswitch and mechanical feel the V3 brings is the closest any controller has come to emulating the feel of mechanical keyboards and speedy mice. It has a huge impact on the way you play games, and although there are slight changes to ergonomics I\u2019d make, namely making the grips a little larger, the V3 is a triumph of controller design for those looking to up their competitive game.\nI was also surprised to feel such crunchy feedback when platforming in Celeste, as this wasn\u2019t something I remember from reviewing the Pro edition. It\u2019s nice that you can have a controller so bred for multilayer success and yet also enjoy single-player games with Razer\u2019s rumbly haptics. I definitely felt the lack of the rubberized grips in the Tournament Edition when scaling a section of Celeste Mountain, however. Leaning on the back buttons and having larger hands means I have to slightly slant my left palm away from the grip. But without the rubberized texture, the plastic material very quickly starts to rub against the inside of my middle finger, irritating it and forming the beginning of a blister. That\u2019s not ideal for longer, more intense, sweaty sessions so I\u2019d caution anyone who has sensitive skin on their hands to maybe invest in a friendlier controller.\nI was worried that the Tournament Edition\u2019s lack of swappable thumbstick tops would ruin its first-person shooter prowess, especially since I usually prefer a taller thumbstick to offset deadzones and allow for smaller, more precise corrections in Hunt: Showdown. Luckily, the thumbsticks on the V3 TE have a really generous indentation, meaning you can still pull off tiny aiming adjustments without feeling like you\u2019re being held back by unruly deadzones. I wish the Scuf Valor Pro I reviewed a week before this could have taken note because this is an example of a wired controller with even more limitations in terms of adjustability, but it can actually swing with the top dogs in the market in FPS games. Granted, this may come down to preference for you, but the slippy thumbsticks and poor shapes on the Valor Pro don\u2019t do anything to help my FPS abilities.\nMapping back buttons is much easier on the V3 TE than on Scuf\u2019s controller as well, and activating the 1000Hz mode or customizing more deeply is possible thanks to Razer\u2019s companion software, or a handy three-button shortcut. These are the sorts of quality-of-life wins a controller should have out of the box if it\u2019s going to be restricted to wired-only play, and it feels much better value for money than Scuf\u2019s latest pad as a result.\nIn both third-person games and intense fighting games, the Wolverine V3 TE\u2019s speed comes in so handy. I\u2019m yet to find a controller that plays Dragon Ball Sparking Zero better than this, in fact, other gamepads, even the GameSir Cyclone 2 pales in comparison despite also having microswitch buttons.\nShould you buy the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro\nI like the Razer Wolverine V3 TE. For a brand that knows how to charge through the roof for its gamepads, this peripheral allows players to access the brilliant redesign of the Wolverine without spending $200 on the pro model. It\u2019s always difficult for me to justify the price of officially licensed Xbox controllers that stray over the $100-$150 mark since there are so many viable and sometimes better options under $100. But The Wolverine V3 TE grants access to that premium range without splashing into the stupidly expensive pool. It reminds me of the Elite Series 2 Core in that way, albeit without as clear an upgrade path.\nCan you do without wireless play, swappable thumbstick tops, a carry case, and rubberized grips? If the answer is yes, there\u2019s not much point in spending money on the full-fat Wolverine V3 Pro. You really don\u2019t feel as though you\u2019re compromising much here as so many design elements and features carry over to the more affordable Tournament Edition.\nThen again, if the $100 mark is still too steep for you, there are plenty of other clicky microswitch controllers on the shelves like the Easy SMX X10 - just be prepared to miss those extra buttons.\nHow I tested the Razer Wolverine V3 TE\nI put the Razer Wolverine V3 TE to the test for around a week before this review was written. In that time I played with it in a multitude of games and genres, including Celeste, Shadow of Mordor, Hunt Showdown, Avowed, and more. I compared my use closely with the Wolverine V3 Pro, as well as other microswitch controllers. I also compared it with the Scuf Valor Pro, which is another officially licensed Xbox controller for $100 that only allows for wired play.\nFor more on how we test controllers, check out the full GamesRadar+ Hardware Policy.\nNot found your dream gamepad yet?

      "text": "This wired Xbox controller helped my FPS gameplay more than Scuf did, and it's a bargain at $69.99\nOne of the best controllers I've tested in 2025 is 30% off right now\nThe Razer Wolverine V3 TE is laser-focused on speed, in a way its competitors can't quite keep up with. With a $30 discount on its $99.99 MSRP at Woot, this gamepad is topping the value charts this week.\nScuf controllers are said to be designed around FPS gameplay first and foremost, but after testing out the brand's Valor Pro for Xbox earlier this year, I'm not convinced. For reference, I've been reviewing the best Xbox Series X controllers for years now, and there's one in particular that I tested this year that I'd easily recommend over Scuf.\nThe Razer Wolverine V3 TE is very similar to Scuf's latest controller in that it's wired-only and has the same $99.99 price. Unlike the Valor Pro, however, it's designed around speed, so its six extra buttons all utilize mouse switches taken from one of Razer's Esports clickers. These make a massive difference in FPS games in particular, so seeing this gamepad discounted down to $69.99 at Woot means I'm keen to recommend it while it's cheap.\nRazer Wolverine V3 TE | $99.99 $69.99 at Woot\nSave $30 - I haven't seen the Razer Wolverine V3 TE come down this low in price since it came out. To be honest, I didn't expect to see this kind of price on it for at least a year, seeing as it's already the cheaper version of the brand's flagship controller.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You don't mind a white controller\n\u2705 You want loads of extra functionality\n\u2705 A speedy, clicky controller is up your street\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You want wireless play\n\u274c You want the adjustments and part swapping of the Pro model\nShould you buy the Razer Wolverine V3 TE?\nThese pro controllers can be pricey, especially now that so many are shipping with wireless support. The Wolverine V3 TE is actually a more affordable version of the V3 Pro, which costs $199.99. I really don't see much of a difference between the two versions, which makes this an even sweeter deal.\nOne of the main reasons I'd recommend the Razer Wolverine V3 TE over the Scuf Valor Pro is due to its six extra back buttons (Scuf only has four). Razer's back buttons are well placed compared to older designs in its Wolverine line. They're also so much faster to actuate than Scuf's back buttons. The extra shoulder buttons are a huge benefit too, especially in FPS games, since it means you don't ever need to take your thumbs off the sticks if you play your cards right.\nI usually prefer to swap out my thumbsticks for taller ones in FPS games, but that's a feature reserved for the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro. To my surprise, though, I didn't feel as though that was hampering my FPS abilities while testing out this controller, and thanks to the Hall sensor sticks you can adjust via software, I could get the deadzones and sensitivity I wanted.\nThe other thing you'll miss out on versus the Pro Model of this controller is wired support, which might be a big deal for some players. The Pro version also comes with a carrying case for those attachments and swappable bits. Lastly, some rubberized grips on the full-fat version make it ever so slightly more comfortable in the hands, depending on the way you grip it.\nRegardless of comparisons, the V3 TE is definitely one of the best PC controllers I've tested this year, even when it's at full price. Being laid low by 30% makes it an absolute steal for competitive FPS players. Woot says this deal ends on May 21 or until it sells out.\nLooking for a controller for a different platform?

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nThe Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is a massive improvement over the brand\u2019s previous gamepads. Its refined ergonomics are a huge win, and its commitment to speedy mechanical switches gives it massive competitive potential in the right hands. Unfortunately, even at a lower price than its PS5 sibling, it\u2019s still undeniably expensive, especially in a market that\u2019s slowly filling up with much more affordable competition.\nPros\n- +\nFour well-placed back buttons\n- +\nTwo extra bumpers\n- +\nAttachments and carry case (not typical for Razer)\n- +\nSpeedy buttons\nCons\n- -\nDeadzones feel a bit large out of the box\n- -\nThe grips feel slightly too short\n- -\nStill needlessly expensive\n- -\nWireless connectivity ills\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nThe Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is by far the best controller this brand has ever produced. Razer controllers have always sounded so good on paper - I remember being more excited for the Wolverine V2 Pro than the DualSense Edge a couple of years ago because it offered six extra buttons, microswitch buttons, and a beefier feel.\nIn practice though, I\u2019ve always found Razer\u2019s controllers to ever so slightly miss the mark, either misplacing their back buttons or ultimately feeling cheaper than their premium price tags should suggest. The Wolverine V3 Pro feels like a new chapter though, and it\u2019s making a serious play for a spot on our best PC controller list. This is a peripheral that shows Razer has gone back to the drawing board, listened to feedback from fans and critics, and genuinely improved upon its product.\nEven the price has been refined, although I\u2019m not sure people will be any happier with the result. The Razer Wolverine V2 Pro on PS5 costs $249 / \u00a3249, but the enhanced V3 Pro has managed to adhere to the $200 / \u00a3200 mark. If that\u2019s still too much for you, Razer has made a Tournament Edition which skimps on a few features but comes in at just $99.99 / \u00a399.99. Are all of these improvements enough in a market that\u2019s stacked with affordable competition?\nDesign\nThe design ethos behind the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro was to convert the speed and performance from Razer\u2019s successful mice and keyboards into an Xbox Series X controller. After all, controller players are constantly mocked for not being able to keep up with traditional PC players, but if they have the speed of mechanical switches from Esports mice at their fingertips, maybe that\u2019ll give them the boost they need.\nIn shape and size, the V3 Pro feels similar to the previous Wolverine models. It has that slightly bloated, more rounded feel in the hands than the stock Xbox controllers, but the new version feels more robust and professional than the Razer Wolverine V2 Pro ever has. I always find that Razer\u2019s PS5 controller has a fairly hollow feel to it, and its metallic thumbstick guards create an echoed clacking sound that doesn\u2019t do much to justify its high price tag. The V3 Pro sounds much tougher, and although I don\u2019t like its $200 demands, it at least feels like a premium peripheral. Besides maybe the PowerA Advantage Controller, I can\u2019t think of another gamepad I\u2019d bet money on surviving a Mous case-style drop test.\nThe grips have a rubberized hexed texture that doesn\u2019t over-exert itself. The GameSir Kaleid Flux controller has that 3D dotted texture on its grips which sometimes makes your hands itch, but the V3 doesn\u2019t go that far. Despite some refined ergonomics elsewhere in the package, I\u2019m a tad disappointed that the grips haven\u2019t been elongated since previous Wolverines. My pinky fingers don\u2019t feel catered to with this pad, which becomes more of a problem now that the back buttons are placed properly.\nTo be completely frank, the back button placement on the older Wolverine models is completely nonsensical. They live on the controller\u2019s back plate, but they\u2019re central and are placed far too high up. The result is a pair of unruly half-triggers that pay no mind to how a human being actually holds a controller. The back buttons in the V3 models feel like the biggest improvement of the entire product because they sit exactly where your middle and ring fingers naturally rest. I find I can either curl my fingers to press these with their tips, or I can have a more relaxed hold and actuate the buttons with the insides of my DIP joints.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nFeatures\nThe Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is an officially licensed Xbox controller, which means it\u2019s available to use with that console and ecosystem, as well as PC. Razer, like more and more peripheral makers these days, has skirted around that annoying stipulation for Xbox controllers that means they can only use a wired connection. The V3 Pro is a wireless option that comes with a USB dongle, but most competitive PC players might be drawn to a wired connection anyway since it can reach a 1000Hz polling rate when tethered. The more affordable Tournament Edition is locked to a wired-only connection, so this is worth weighing up if you\u2019re trying to decide which controller to go for.\nThere\u2019s clearly a lot of thought that\u2019s gone into this pad\u2019s extra buttons. According to Razer, they feature actual mouse switches from one of its unnamed Esports mice that\u2019s supposedly \u201cmarket leading\u201d. I\u2019d love more specifics on that if I\u2019m honest, but they do the trick. Either way, this places them in a league of their own. Back buttons are usually simple plastic switches that don\u2019t have much feel to them at all, and back paddles found on the DualSense Edge and Elite Series 2 use magnetic levers that feel much more premium. With a mechanical set of four back buttons, the V3 Pro treads the line between the two, offering more speed and a feel that\u2019s consistent with the product's other switches.\nLooking at the controller from the top down, we have the two additional bumpers that this line of Razer\u2019s controllers is known for. These are almost identical to the ones found on the Razer Kishi Ultra, and although they\u2019re not my most-used feature, Razer wanted to carry them over for players who use a \u201cclaw-grip\u201d, since they aren\u2019t catered to all that often.\nThe rest of the buttons use a mix of membrane and mechanical switches, so the D-pad feels very spongy while the very shiny face buttons have more responsiveness. Using the trigger-stops, you can even give the triggers a super-quick mechanical actuation, which could be huge for budding Esports players. The Hall Sensor thumbsticks have removable tops, which is a first for Razer. For the brand that charges the highest price for its controllers, it is wild to think this is the first option with replaceable thumbsticks and a carrying case. It\u2019s not quite the attachment selection offered by the Victrix Pro BFG for Xbox, but it\u2019s much better than a controller and a cable in a plastic box, which is what Razer has offered until now. If you do opt for the cheaper Tournament Edition, you won\u2019t get that carry case.\nOn an Xbox, the V3 Pro pads feature a 250Hz polling rate, which is standard for the platform. You\u2019ll also be able to benefit from Xbox haptics, but on PC you get more for your investment, with that 1000Hz polling rate when wired, as well as Razer\u2019s RGB Chroma syncing up with your rig\u2019s other Razer-lit accessories. Of course, the Razer controller app for mobile and PC lets you tune deadzones for both sticks and remap the additional buttons. I\u2019m delighted that you can do the latter without downloading an app though.\nPerformance\nI\u2019ve played loads of different games with the latest Wolverine controller, from Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero to Pools, to platforming around in Owlboy. This really is a versatile controller, and it has as much to offer in single-player games as it does in competitive multiplayer ones.\nEven in early tests, it\u2019s clear that speed was a priority for Razer\u2019s product designers. Nothing better exemplified that than my time in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero. Speed is quite literally everything in that game, and both the back buttons and face buttons have saved my skin during many a difficulty-spiked bonus level. I did, however, find that the game\u2019s button-mashing moments felt less forgiving on this controller than on the likes of the DualSense on PS5. Mechanical or membrane buttons are great for fast actuation, but something about them makes my joints scream \u201cPlease stop doing this, you aren\u2019t 12 years old anymore\u201d.\nSpeed was equally useful when playing through a level of Celeste, as I do with every controller I test. Back buttons can be a blessing and a curse when it comes to this game\u2019s tight platforming because if they take too much pressure to press, you can end up hindering yourself. Using back buttons, face buttons, analog sticks, or a d-pad with the V3 Pro, I felt I had an accurate tool for the movements I was trying to pull off.\nI do, however, have a gripe with the wireless connectivity. When playing on a PC using the wireless USB dongle about five feet away from me, I frequently found that sitting the controller on my lap and crossing my legs, was enough to block the connection, which created all sorts of problems. Sometimes, it prevented the PC from actually pairing with the controller, which was infuriating when I was trying to enjoy a quick level of Owlboy on a lunch break. I have found this to be a frequent issue with some wireless controllers, but I haven\u2019t experienced it quite as much as I did with this one.\nLuckily, the thumbsticks are another saving grace of the V3 Pro. I recorded gameplay of Pools for a video I was making a few months ago, and the eerie tension in that game means that quick turns of the camera are vital. Using the Wolverine\u2019s taller thumbstick attachment I was able to look over my shoulder for lurking eldritch monsters at a moment\u2019s notice. When I was taking a moment to enjoy the game\u2019s vast halls, smooth camera pans were a breeze to control, and it\u2019s nice to have a peripheral that can do both.\nAs an FPS controller, the Wolverine\u2019s six extra buttons are as good as ever. I was able to wield all of the in-game actions in Hunt: Showdown, barely needing to take my thumbs off of their sticks. I do wish the deadzones were smaller out of the box since I felt my accuracy suffered before diving into customization software. Overall, the V3 Pro wasn\u2019t exactly on par with the Azeron Cyborg II, but this is still one of the best gamepads currently available for FPS games. In a similar way, game feel wasn\u2019t quite on par with the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra, but it was good enough that I didn\u2019t feel I needed to finetune the out-of-the-box vibration levels.\nShould you buy the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro?\nIt really shows you just how much Razer has been overcharging for its V2 Wolverine on PS5 when this massive improvement costs less - and it's still $200. There\u2019s no dodging the fact that the competition from GameSir and EasySMX is now capable of throwing out equally good products for much, much less money than this. The PowerA Fusion Pro manages to stay under $100 while also having four back buttons and official licensing from Microsoft, so I struggle to see why the V3 Pro should cost as much as it does. Even Victrix and Turtle Beach manage to keep their options under $200.\nSure, you could opt for the Tournament Edition if you\u2019re willing to forgo a carry case, the grip textures, swappable thumbsticks, and a wireless connection. Then again, I haven\u2019t tested that model, so I can\u2019t say it\u2019ll have that truly robust feel that I enjoyed here.\nOn the other hand, this is a controller that feels speedier than the current pool of Xbox options. If you\u2019re drawn in by six extra buttons (that are actually usable now), mechanical and membrane feel, and the pedigree of Razer\u2019s previous work, I can\u2019t blame you for splashing out on this. It\u2019s a premium option, but you\u2019ll likely be happy you spent the money on it.\nHow I tested the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro\nI put the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro to the test for a number of months before this review was written. In that time, I used it for the majority of my PC playtime, in games like Celeste, Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, Owlboy, Hunt: Showdown, Pools, and Hellblade II. I used the controller in wired and wireless mode and swapped the back buttons and extra bumpers extensively during my testing time.\nI compared my experience closely to when I reviewed the Wolverine V2 Pro, as well as other Razer gamepads. For more on how we test controllers, check out the full GamesRadar+ Hardware Policy.\nLooking for something cheaper? There are plenty of options out there if you look at our list of the best Xbox One controllers, best PS4 controllers, or the best Xbox Series X accessories.\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension."

If you're torn between this and a few other controllers, this one won't steer you wrong\nCon;\nThe only real con, imo, is that the space where my middle fingers go, is a bit poorly shaped, and my fingers grind into the back of the controller. That's it.\nEverything else, is really more of a missed opportunity of the company rather than an issue with the controller itself;\nThe dock has a space for the wireless dongle, but you still need to plug them in separately. With the 8bitdo controllers for example, the dock has a port for the dongle to plug into, so you can plug the dock into your computer and it will power the dock and act as the dongle plug in as well. Wish they updated the dock.\nThe physical customizability is lacking a bit... You can change the face plates, but there are only two available. I have both and the clear one is awful on the black controller. The light doesn't go into the body, so it's kinda pointless, unfortunately. I wish they had more options, it would be fun!\nAnd lastly, the software on the controller is perfectly fine for customizing the buttons and feel of the controller, but with the awesome screen it has, after I set up my controller initially, I never used it again. I would love for them to set up some kind of software that would, I dunno, read the computer clock speeds, temp, or anything else, and display it on the controller.\nAgain, these are just missed opportunities that would have made this my favorite controller of all time, rather than just an amazing one.\n-\nAli HadiGranskad i Saudiarabien den 27 oktober 2024\n5,0 av 5 stj\u00e4rnor \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0632\u0647\nF\u00e4rg: VittVerifierat k\u00f6p\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0623\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u062c\u0648\u062f\u062a\u0647\u0627.\n\u0645\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0632\u0647\nProduktsammanfattning presenterar viktig produktinformation\nKortkommando\nskift\n+\nalt\n+\nopt\n+\nD\nProduktsammanfattning: (Ingen drift) ManbaOne tr\u00e5dl\u00f6s spelkontroll med interaktiv sk\u00e4rm f\u00f6r Switch/Windows PC/iOS/Android,halleffektpinne och avtryckare med laddningsdocka (vit)\nFr\u00e5n Manba\n4,4 av 5 stj\u00e4rnor, 1 776 betyg\nKundrecensionerOm den h\u00e4r artikeln\n- \u3010Exklusiv innovativ visuell interaktiv sk\u00e4rm\u3011Manba One-seriens tr\u00e5dl\u00f6sa kontroller skapar en ny era av kontrollsk\u00e4rmar.

      "text": "The best PS5 controller 2025: Find your Edge\nGet ahead of the game with the best PS5 controllers on the market\nThe best PS5 controllers will broaden your gaming horizons. A new gamepad, wheel, or mobile controller can expand the ways you enjoy your favorite PS5 games, and even give you a totally fresh take on one you might have played already. Whether you're looking for a replacement for an ageing DualSense, or you're wanting to take your first leap into the world of back buttons and pro features, the PS5 controller market is waiting for you. Luckily, I've been doing the hard part for you, and I've narrowed down your best options into one convenient list.\nThe pro controller scene for PS5 is arguably better than it ever was for PS4, and I know that from time spent testing and reviewing the latest ones. Some of the gamepads in the list below even feature in our best PC controllers list, and a few are backwards compatible with the PS4. You don't even need to go for the official DualSense Edge if you're looking for something with back buttons either, because there are lots of third-party options you can get that have even more functionality.\nDon't forget, either, that there are plenty of situational controllers that will work with the PS5. For example, you can get a mobile controller for taking your games on the go, or opt for the PlayStation Portal. There are also steering wheels that'll be right in line with those PS5 players who enjoy taking to the virtual tracks. There's even a Guitar controller from PDP called the Riffmaster which, although it isn't on this list, is a perfect choice for the rhythm gamers out there. We just heard word about a new version of Hori's fightpad for PS5 as well, which will be a perfect controller to consider for anyone trying to up their rank in games like Tekken. While we wait to test that out, here are the picks you should consider.\nThe Quick List\nBest overall\nUndoubtedly our favorite controller overall at the moment, the Victrix Pro BFG is competitively priced and simply makes you better at every game you touch with it. This is probably one of the best gamepads ever made and we even prefer the customization elements over the Edge.\nBest for features\nThe DualSense Edge is Sony's first homegrown pro controller, and it's a great all-rounder. Its integration into the PS5's UI makes it a serious contender on this list because of the features on offer. We just wish it wasn't so pricey.\nBest for longevity\nHall Sensor sticks that are immune to stick drift make this the best gamepad on the shelves for longevity. As if that wasn't enough, Nacon has made something that's great for Esports and multiplayer too.\nBest for most\nDespite its stick drift issues and lack of wider support, the DualSense is still one of the most innovative controllers ever made, and it has some excellent features. It's also available in a slew of colors now too.\nBest mobile\nIf you're a fan of remote play, or just playing mobile games while you're out and about, the GameSir G8 Galileo is our current pick for the best mobile controller. The Backbone One is also an option but see below to find out why we prefer this.\nBest DualSense alternative\nScuf's controllers are known for their quality, if not their high prices. Regardless, if you want a traditional DualSense feel with some extra features from a third party, the Scuf Reflex range is your best bet. You're boosting customization, with a range of designs to choose from as well.\nShow more \u2193\nMost buttons\nThe Razer Wolverine V2 Pro has four back buttons and two additional bumpers, making it the controller with the most bang for your buck in terms of functionality. This is a gamepad for folks who like a chunkier build.\nBest remote player\nThe PlayStation Portal isn't the PS5 handheld we were hoping for, but if you want something for remote play, it doesn't get much better than this.\nBest racing wheel\nFor those who are looking to level up their Gran Turismo game, a racing wheel is just the thing. You can play a great selection of driving games and racing sims with the Thrustmaster T248, making it a best buy.\nDon't tell the other bits of tech I get to review for a living, but controllers are probably my favorite type of gaming hardware. I love testing gamepads, evaluating their ergonomics, their pro features, and testing whether they help or hurt my gaming performance. PS5 controllers are some of the best on the shelves, and I'm always eagerly awaiting the next newcomer to the market.\nJune 30, 2025: It's been a quiet month for PS5 controllers, with no news about new officially licensed models. In that light, I've updated this page for the summer, with a slight reordering of the list to reflect what more people might be looking for as we head into Prime Day sales. I've also added a brief note about the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited, a new version of the R5P for Xbox and PC players, you can find on this list.\nThe best PS5 controller overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAre you sick of hearing about how a controller can't keep up with a mouse and keyboard? Because with the Victrix Pro BFG at your disposal, that might not be such a clear-cut contest anymore. This is undoubtedly the best PS5 controller because it's been designed with elite performance in mind, and thanks to a clever modular design, you can tailor it to your exact preferences.\nDesign: That modular design means the controller's two facial components are removable, and you can switch them out or even swap them around to suit you, the game you're playing, and the way you want to play. The suite of attachments that come in the case is one of the most conclusive offerings I've ever come across in a controller. Among them are a taller analog stick for precision aiming, multiple D-pad choices, stick gates, and a \"fightpad\" module that gives you six face buttons. Like the Thrustmaster E-Swap X Pro, the modules can also be flipped around so the sticks are symmetrical.\nOn the back, you'll find four excellent back buttons that are built so well into the grips of the pad that they're effortless to use. Of course, being an officially licensed PlayStation controller, you get the classic home button, share button, option button, and touchpad.\n\u2705You prioritize performance over any fancy software or features: This controller doesn't have haptic feedback or even rumble, but it has so many clever design features that add a lot of value.\n\u2705You play a lot of multiplayer games: If you play competitively in any online multiplayer game, whether it's a first-person shooter or a fighting game, this is the controller for you.\n\u2705You want the best back buttons on the market: The four back buttons on this controller are really well-designed and placed beautifully. Although some prefer the paddles found on first-party controllers, the Victrix Pro BFG's tactile and highly usable buttons feel excellent.\n\u2705You want to spend as little as possible on a pro controller: The Victrix Pro BFG is cheaper than the other PS5 pro controllers on the shelves at the moment and offers the best value for money in terms of competitive features.\n\u274cYou like a heavier controller: The Victrix Pro BFG is pretty lightweight in the hands and isn't the chunkiest for folks that like a more substantial feel.\n\u274cYou need those DualSense features: If you mainly play first-party PS5 games, you'll benefit from having Haptic Feedback and trigger resistance, which this controller doesn't offer.\n\u274cYou don't care about customization: If you don't need to personalize and customize a controller's modules to your liking, maybe don't go for this one.\nFeatures: In pursuit of pure performance, this controller is relentlessly stripped back. You won't find any rumble or haptic feedback, which is a bit of a shame, and there isn't any DualSense trigger resistance, although the Pro BFG does feature trigger stops. The biggest features of this controller are very much in its design and all the swappable modules and add-ons.\nThere is a \"Tournament Lock\" mode that stops you from pressing the system/function buttons during competition, which can sometimes result in disqualification. You don't need any companion software here either, as you can change profiles and button mappings with function button shortcuts alone. Definitely check the manual of this pad to know all of its hidden shortcuts as there are a few useful ones you should know, like double-tapping the function button to mute yourself.\nThe Victrix Pro BFG's connection is either wired USB-C to USB-A or via a wireless dongle. Battery life here could be better in wireless mode, it lasts around the same time as a DualSense Edge, which isn't impressive considering how stripped-back it is.\nAlthough it's got official PlayStation licensing, it works for PC and PS4 as well.\nPerformance: In terms of value for money, this is by far one of the best controllers to hit the shelves in recent years, especially when you consider that it's cheaper than its competition up and down this list of the best PS5 controllers.\nThere isn't a game I can turn this controller to that I don't feel advantaged in. From its ergonomic design, its best-in-class back buttons, its swappable modules, and attachments, to even its size and feel in the hands, there is no better controller at the moment.\nIt feels ridiculous to argue that, given that the Victrix Pro BFG doesn't have the DualSense's next-generation features. But let's be real for a second - those amazing features are great, but they aren't supported by nearly enough games, and this gamepad focuses on the aspects of a controller that really matter.\nWhether it's a first-person shooter, a game you're trying to speedrun, an intense platformer, or a competitive fighting game, this is the best PS5 controller there is.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best PS5 controller for features\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe DualSense Edge is the first homemade pro controller from Sony, and it offers a number of quality-of-life updates over the original DualSense. It isn't everything we hoped for in PlayStation's first official pro gamepad, but it's still one of the best PS5 controllers out there.\n\u2705You want those bespoke DualSense features in an all-around improved package: Adaptive trigger resistance, haptic feedback, and a whole load of software to fine-tune it to your liking.\n\u2705You mainly play single-player, or first-party PS5 exclusives: There's no better way to experience Sony's homemade games than with Sony's first homemade pro controller.\n\u2705You only need two back buttons: It's a shame the DualSense Edge costs more than other PS5 controllers but has fewer back buttons, but at least the paddles provided here are really comfortable.\n\u274cYou want a genuine, honest fix to stick drift: You can buy replacement stick modules for the DualSense Edge, but there's not guarantee you won't run into the same drift issues you may have with the DualSense.\n\u274cYou want more battery life: The battery life here is worse than on the original DualSense, so it's worth looking elsewhere if that's something that bothers you.\n\u274cYou need more than two back buttons: For more competitive, PC-optimized games, I'd recommend a controller with at least four back buttons.\nDesign and features: Rounded corners at the bottom of the grips, as well as a heftier weight, make it feel much more premium and ergonomic in the hands than the original DualSense. Seriously, this is the comfort I wanted from the DualSense, and I have no idea why rounded corners don't feature in the regular DualSense.\nClever software integration means you can fine-tune bespoke PS5 features like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, and function buttons found under the control sticks help to change customizable profiles in a flash. Not only that, but you can map all the buttons on the gamepad to your liking, allowing for some serious versatility.\nThere are also trigger-stop levels at play here. On that note, the triggers have a more textured feel thanks to the sacred symbols being embossed on their lower halves. You don't get much in the way of swappable parts here, but you do get a decent hard case that the controller can be charged while in.\nPerformance: The DualSense Edge has a shorter battery life than the original DualSense, and doesn't truly fix the widespread stick drift issues. Although entire stick modules can be replaced, we'd have an easier time recommending it if there were genuine alternatives like Hall sensors.\nRegardless, this is a really comfortable controller that I use for a lot of PlayStation games I don't feel I need a competitive edge in. It's a good halfway house between something bred for performance and something that has those bespoke PS5 controller features that make gameplay feel truly next-gen.\nThe two back button attachments are extremely comfortable and work really well. Unfortunately, there are only two of them, which means for a similar price you can get third-party controllers that offer a load more functionality.\nUnfortunately, this controller would be so much easier to recommend if it wasn't so expensive for what it is. Compared to Xbox's Elite Series 2, and even the Victrix Pro BFG, you should get a lot more controller for the money here.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best PS5 controller for longevity\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Nacon Revolution 5 Pro is the spiritual successor to the Nacon Revolution Unlimited, which was one of the best officially licensed pro controllers for PS4. Equipped with Hall Sensor sticks, it's the first controller on this list that's immune to stick drift issues.\nQuick note for those looking for a PC controller: The new Revolution X Unlimited is an updated version of this pad, which improves on some of the issues I had with it. If you're really looking for something to play PC games with, I'd argue the Revolution X Unlimited is the better buy, particularly since it's the same price.\n\u2705You want Hall Sensor sticks: No stick drift will be tempting if you've been burned by that problem before.\n\u2705You want something for competitive play: four back buttons and a suite of features and customization means this is up there with the best Esports gamepads you'll find.\n\u2705You prefer a broader controller: the wider and broader build quality of this gamepad makes it welcoming for players with larger hands.\n\u274cYou want the best back buttons: a few design flaws mean this doesn't have the best back buttons available, but they're still good.\n\u274cYou like tighter stick tensions: The right stick has fairly loose stick tension, so if you prefer a tighter feel, this might not be for you.\n\u274cYou use a wired headset: read more in our review, but your microphone audio has a chance to be compromised.\nDesign and features: In its design, the Nacon Revolution 5 Pro feels very similar to the Nacon Revolution Unlimited. It's got the same broad shoulders and long grips, its face buttons are large, and the circle button spills over the right-hand side in the same way.\nAlongside asymmetrical Hall Sensor thumbsticks, the R5P also packs in four back buttons, varying stick tops and gates, weights you can add to the handles, and four profiles per platform. The chassis sports a matted rubberized surface that feels really nice and cool in the hands. Nacon deserves additional praise for putting sustainability at the heart of this gamepad's design.\nThe features list of the Revolution 5 Pro (R5P) is as exhaustive as you'll find these days: wired and wireless connectivity, an impressive 10-hour lifespan, companion PC software for fine-tuning, and even extensive audio settings and multipoint wireless connectivity.\nPerformance: When it comes to competitive gaming, the Nacon Revolution 5 Pro is as close as it gets to the Victrix Pro BFG. Its larger size and increased heft might even make it more appealing to a lot of players. Annoyingly, looser stick tension and less ergonomic back buttons make it fall short for us.\nAdditionally, there are some flaws, particularly if you use a wired headset, as Nacon's noise canceling software means your microphone audio will be accompanied by a grating white noise.\nEither way, this is one of the best controllers we tested in 2023, and it felt just as at home in a first-person shooter as it did in a platformer or a third-person game. Being immune to stick drift would make this the best PS5 controller for longevity as it is, but the build quality here gives us so much confidence that this controller will last you a long way into the future.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best PS5 controller for most players\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe DualSense is the one PS5 accessory that's included with the console, but it's also one most of us will undoubtedly buy more than once. With the DualSense, games are more immersive when features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are adopted and incorporated into games' mechanics. Feel the textures of gravel in your fingers as you drive through streets, as well as the tension in the strings of your bow as you draw back an arrow.\n\u2705You want those bespoke features: Haptic feedback is a game changer that's worth having for first-party games.\n\u2705You mainly play first-party PS5 exclusives: There's no real replacement for the DualSense in first-party exclusive games since they're designed to be played with it.\n\u2705You don't care about a pro controller and the extra features they bring: If you don't mind not having back buttons and competitive customization features, the DualSense Edge is a premium controller without them.\n\u274cYou've been burned before: If you've already gone through one DualSense that's died due to stick drift or poor durability, vote with your wallet and go for something else.\n\u274cYou want something long-lasting: The DualSense isn't exactly a reliable or durable gamepad, so go elsewhere if you don't want to buy again later.\n\u274cYou want back buttons and mainly play multiplayer games: If you're not playing PlayStation exclusives, why not go for something with more functionality?\nDesign and features: The DualSense takes a bit of a design leap away from the DualShock 4. It has more abrasive feeling corners to it and arguably isn't as ergonomic. What it lacks in comfort, it gains in features, however.\nHaptic feedback is an evolution of rumble that gives you extremely tactile, specific game feel in titles that support it. From rain in Returnal tapping away at your controller, to different weaponry in Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart feeling stupidly distinct, this is the best a controller has ever felt during gameplay.\nAdaptive trigger resistance can offer some interesting gameplay angles when supported well, although it's a shame the ability to fine-tune its levels isn't the easiest without the more expensive Edge model. Moreover, in older models of this controller, it isn't uncommon to see trigger springs break or lose tension entirely when a game only tunes this resistance up to full. Kena: Bridge of Spirits crippled my original PS5 controllers.\nMore colors are now available - Midnight Black, Cosmic Red, Starlight Blue, Nova Pink, and Galactic Purple - have joined the party, there's a bit more choice to work with and to inject some jazz and personalization into your setup. There are also some lovely limited editions to look out for, and I'm sure we'll see more of these in the future.\nPerformance: While the DualSense is a truly next-gen controller and its features are nothing short of revolutionary, it is disappointing how this controller has performed over time. I wouldn't argue it's lived up to its potential. That's partly down to such a small number of games truly supporting its bespoke features, but it's mainly down to such poor durability.\nThe DualSense has been plagued with stick drift issues since its launch. The original batch, especially, is infamous for not lasting very long before stick drift becomes a serious issue. This is supposedly a lot better now that Sony hasn't had to cut corners with pandemic manufacturing and can really work on mitigating the issues.\nNewer models seem to suffer from this less, but without genuine solutions to this, like Hall Sensor sticks that use tiny electromagnets instead of potentiometers, there's no guarantee this won't happen if you buy a newer DualSense.\nElsewhere, triggers in particular, feel very fragile at times. I've mentioned the springs in mine snapped, and that has given me a glaring lack of trust in this controller's adaptive triggers. As cool as it can be, if it isn't essential to a game, I usually turn trigger resistance off.\nBattery life is another concern. It really doesn't last very long, and it's a shame this isn't something that was paid more attention to in the controller's development. These issues make me a bit more critical of the gamepad as a whole and make me seriously miss the comfort of the DualShock 4.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best mobile controller for PS5\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe GameSir G8 Galileo saw the bar that Backbone had clearly set for the mobile controller market and raised it in ways I didn't know it could. This is a bigger, better mobile controller in almost every way, and its cheaper price than its rivals makes it an easy pick for the top of this list.\n\u2705You want to take your games on the go: A mobile controller lets you use remote play to take your gaming session wherever you need to.\n\u2705You think a PlayStation Portal isn't worth it: The new-gen PSP has proven popular, but a good mobile controller that can use Remote Play could save you money.\n\u2705You want a mobile controller that's comfortable for larger hands: The GameSir G8 Galileo is pretty much full-size compared to a normal PS5 controller, so you won't suffer the same hand cramps as you do with other mobile options.\n\u274cYou don't use Remote Play\n\u274cYou'd rather get something with official licensing: While the G8 is currently our favorite mobile controller and it can use remote play with PS5, it isn't officially licensed.\n\u274cYou like the look of the PlayStation Portal: Sony's strange handheld device is another viable Remote Play option for PS5.\nDesign and features: The G8 Galileo has chunkier, larger grips than other mobile controllers you'll find, and sports Hall Sensor thumbsticks and triggers that make you feel like you're playing on an ordinary gamepad, not a stand-in phone controller for shorter sessions. The design choices here make so much sense - even down to the pivoting USB-C connector that removes any fear your phone could snap it off during removal.\nPerformance: I didn't realize that I viewed mobile controllers as a means to an end - I only really tend to use them when I'm on a journey somewhere, I have a brief moment of time to kill, or I'm at a friend's house and need to take my games on the go. The G8 Galileo is so much more comfortable and so much more enjoyable to use that I now seek it out for certain games - it's an excuse for me to cloud stream games or use PlayStation Remote Play (yes, it can do both).\nThe catches here then? Well, unlike the Backbone One, it doesn't have official licensing on either side of the console war, which means it could run into problems further down the line if either company takes a harsher line on third-party mobile controllers. Elsewhere, even if its thumbsticks are immune to stick drift, they aren't quite perfect - they can be subject to friction with the stickgates and run a little hot in first-person shooters. These are hardly big issues though - this is by far the best mobile controller money can buy right now.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Backbone One was already a well-established mobile controller for iPhone before Sony gave it official backing. Its original option was already Xbox Game Pass Cloud-compatible, but a brand new officially licensed Xbox variant has just launched too. Of course, you and I know that the PlayStation version was here first, and between you and me, it does a much better job of replicating the look of the console it supports.\n\u2705You like to take your games on the go: Whether it's on a commute, on the toilet, or while someone else uses the TV, the Backbone One PlayStation Edition is a handy little device to have.\n\u2705You think a PlayStation Portal is pointless: We still don't know an awful lot about it, but the Backbone One will no doubt be the clearest reason not to get a Project Q when it arrives.\n\u2705You play games on Game Pass, or mobile as well as the PS5: Backbone One is great because it doesn't tie you down to PlayStation remote play, you can access Game Pass and other mobile gaming services too.\n\u274cYou struggle to find the Nintendo Switch's smaller size comfortable: The Backbone One isn't the most comfortable when used in longer sessions.\n\u274cYou don't play games on the go: If you don't have a need for it, there's no reason to buy yet another PlayStation accessory\n\u274cYou're waiting for PlayStation Portal stock: Sony's strange handheld device does the same as a good mobile controller, but if you're keen for that instead, there's no real need for both.\nDesign and Features: Straight away, it's easy to see the same design language as the PS5 and the DualSense with Backbone One's PlayStation edition, meaning it'll easily slot into your current PlayStation ecosystem. There are the standard face buttons, the share, options, and in-game menu buttons in lieu of a touchpad, as well as a D-pad, and offset thumbsticks.\nThere are L1 and R1 bumpers, and some triggers too, although these perhaps are the only thing that makes the Backbone feel a little cheaper. They click fairly loudly, which is a shame since the rest of the buttons feel almost identical to the DualSense - although they're smaller.\nIn terms of features here, you get a low latency connection, pass-through charging, and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a headset. It would have been nice, but there's no haptic feedback here or trigger resistance - fitting these things into a small package like this would have been tough, and would have pushed the price up. So long as you're an Apple user, it will house almost any iPhone, including the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Max. As for Android, there is now a USB-C option here which works a treat with my Samsung Galaxy S22+.\nAnnoyingly, phone cases won't fit here, but Backbone has just collaborated with a minimalist case maker that does mean you can keep your phone in its case during use.\nPerformance: Remote play is surprisingly easy and much better than you may think, so long as you have the data or Wi-Fi connection to handle it. In fact, with Project Q on the horizon, Backbone One presents an excellent competitor that makes us question why Project Q is being produced at all. With the two likely just being Remote Play controllers for PS5, the Backbone One will almost certainly be cheaper, and isn't just bound to PS5 mobile gaming.\nIn the same way as the Nintendo Switch, the Backbone One can suffer from its smaller size a little. If you have larger hands like me, your thumbs might ache a little from having to force your hands into the appropriate position to use the Backbone one's asymmetrical sticks. Depending on how long you'd be using this for in one sitting though, it might not even be an issue.\nEither way, while it is possible to take a DualSense on the go, having a bespoke controller for the phone itself will make the experience feel much more organic. If you want a bespoke PS5 controller for your phone on your commute, this is your best bet.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best DualSense alternative\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're looking for a PS5 pro controller that's as close as it gets to the design of the DualSense, look no further than the Scuf Reflex. It's compatible with PS5 and PC, and presents an array of design options. It may be pricey, but it's established itself as a strong competitor to the DualSense, and it'll likely be the first point of comparison when the DualSense Edge arrives on the shelves.\n\u2705You want to personalize the look of your PS5 controller: If you care about skins, designs, and colors, Scuf has you covered better than anyone.\n\u2705You like the feel of the DualSense, but want four back buttons as opposed to two: The two back buttons on the DualSense Edge are great, but I don't blame you for wanting more.\n\u2705You can afford it: It ain't cheap, but if you have the money, it's all yours.\n\u274cYou don't like the feel of the DualSense: It goes without saying, but the evil twin looks and feels exactly like the DualSense, so if you don't like that controller, maybe look elsewhere.\n\u274cYou don't have the money: Seriously, there are plenty of other options up and down this list if this costs too much for you.\n\u274cYou want haptic feedback: Yet again, there's no haptics, rumble, or trigger resistance.\nDesign and Features: For starters, The Scuf Reflex already has the Edge beaten in terms of its back buttons. While the Sony option only gives players two additional buttons for a similar price, the Reflex gives you a total of four buttons that can be assigned to in-game functions.\nMoreover, it comes in a few different variants: the Reflex, the Reflex Pro, and the Reflex FPS, and all of these have varying levels of customization. With all these options at your fingertips, you're bound to find a model which suits your hands and one that will give you the competitive edge you're looking for without compromising on the design of the DualSense.\nThere's no haptic feedback or trigger resistance, but other than that, the Scuf Reflex is essentially that evil clone of the DualSense's action hero that pops up for a big fight sequence toward the end of the movie.\nPerformance: The Scuf Reflex performed great in our review testing, giving our reviewer a pleasant experience of back buttons that were usable, and built into a comfortable position. Our reviewer found that there was good grip, and if you like the design and feel of the DualSense, you're not going to get that much difference with this, since they're almost identical.\nWhat is great, is that you can tailor the look of this gamepad to you. There is a myriad of custom skins and aesthetic choices to go for here, which is a real bonus since that's not common on this list of best PS5 controllers. Annoyingly, the biggest reason not to buy here might just be the high price.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe PS5 controller with the most buttons\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Razer Wolverine V2 Pro doesn't fully capitalize on its potential, but it's still up there with the best PS5 controllers on the market. It's just a shame the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro improves upon it to such a massive extent - even lessening its cost. Annoyingly, if you play on PS5, you'll need to opt for the V2 model, but if you're buying a controller for PC gaming, the V3 might be the better investment for you.\nWith a total of six extra buttons compared to a regular DualSense, the Razer Wolverine V2 Pro has the highest number of extra buttons of any controller on this list. It's the next generation in the Wolverine family tree, and the first that's compatible with PlayStation.\n\u2705You want the most amount of buttons possible on a controller: The Wolverine V2 Pro has four back buttons and two extra bumpers - need I say more?\n\u2705You like a chunkier controller: If you have bigger hands or just like the feel of a more substantial Xbox controller, the Wolverine V2 Pro is for you.\n\u2705You want the best battery life: This has the best wireless battery life of any PS5 controller out there.\n\u274cYou want ergonomic back buttons: It may have a lot of them, but the extra buttons here aren't the most comfortable or usable.\n\u274cYou have smaller hands: I'd go for something else if you've got smaller hands - this is one of the chunkier gamepads out there.\n\u274cYou want haptic feedback: Once again, there's no haptics, rumble, or trigger resistance here.\nDesign and Features: The Razer Wolverine V2 Pro is the next evolution of the Wolverine V2 line which started over on the Xbox side of things. It's a chunkier, wider controller for that reason, which makes it a great option for people who prefer the traditional Xbox controller design philosophy. It has wide thumbsticks that feel excellent to use, and most notably, six extra mappable buttons you can program with the Razer mobile app.\nThere are trigger stops too, and both wired and wireless connectivity. Beyond that, this controller doesn't offer the best customization, which is a real shame since that's standard for pro controllers of this kind of price. Also missing is a carry case, which, I admit is hardly essential, but it's always a nice bonus if you need to take our gamepad on the go or want to display it neatly.\nPerformance: Unfortunately, the placement of its back buttons makes the Wolverine V2 Pro harder to recommend, especially for the money. The back buttons are uncomfortable and difficult to use since they're set fairly centrally and high up on the controller's spine. The extra bumpers work great, though, and the relentless functionality that comes from having this many extra buttons at your disposal opens up this gamepad to so many new horizons. For competitive multiplayer shooters, this is a controller that would mean never taking your thumbs off the sticks.\nThe Wolverine V2 Pro also has an excellent battery life which can be even longer if you turn off the fancy RGB chroma lighting on the gamepad's face. This is definitely the best PS5 controller for folks who prefer a chunky, wide pad with offset sticks. Unfortunately, it's one of the most expensive options on this list and has the fewest number of attachments lumped in. Regardless, if you want the highest number of extra buttons possible, and you can forgo a carry case, this is still a really great option.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best PS5 controller for remote play\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe PlayStation Portal isn't the PS5 handheld we were all dreaming it could be. It can connect to Wi-Fi and remote play with a console that's switched on or in rest mode, but it's not a portable version of the platform. This is a real shame because the potential a device like that could have in today's market is boundless. In reality, what we have is a DualSense controller with a screen, so it's still worth a spot on this list.\n\u2705 You live with others: If you live with other people who want to use the TV, the PlayStation Portal is your best way to keep gaming sessions going.\n\u2705 You want to play on the toilet: Let's be real here, the PlayStation Portal is pretty perfect if you need to take your gaming sessions to other rooms in your home.\n\u2705 You want a PS5 handheld: Regardless of some missing features, this is as close as you'll get to a PS5 handheld.\n\u274c Your internet is slow: Got a slow network at home? Portal performance may suffer as a result.\n\u274c You don't have a PS5: This might sound silly, but the PS Portal won't work with the PS4, so you're going to need Sony's new-gen console.\n\u274c You want access more games: The Portal can only stream games using remote play, so if you're after something with more functionality, this isn't the device for you.\nDesign and Features: The PS Portal is effectively an 8-inch LCD screen sandwiched between two halves of a DualSense controller. For that reason, you'll get DualSense features like trigger resistance and haptic feedback, but there's not a lot else separating this from a Backbone One mobile controller you'll find a little further down this list. While the handheld itself fully relies on the PS5 in terms of gameplay, at least this will furnish your fingers with full-sized controls, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers, so it'll feel more like you're playing your PlayStation 5.\nThat's sort of it though, it really is a controller with a screen. There's no internal processing that'll allow this to run games natively. Aesthetically, at least it blends right into the existing PS5 family. Despite the initial reveal rumors, this device doesn't need to be connected to the same Wi-Fi as your PS5.\nPerformance: Your mileage will vary based on your broadband connection, but if you use a reliable network, you'll be able to stream PS5 games with next to no lag. You will potentially run into issues if you choose to also download games to your console while playing, but you shouldn't experience any issues if you avoid doing that. Naturally, frame rates and visual performance are intrinsic to whatever you're actually trying to play using the PS5 itself, meaning any shortcomings are its fault rather than the handheld's.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best racing wheel for PS5\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Thrustmaster T248 enters the best PS5 controller race as our favorite steering wheel option. If you're someone who spends more time on the virtual tracks than on a fighting game stage, and you'd rather perfect your cornering than your FPS aim, maybe this is the controller you should invest in. The T248 takes some of the best features of other wheels and brings them into a package that's more affordable.\n\u2705You spend a lot of time in racing games: These controllers don't come cheap, and they're really only going to be worth the investment if you spend a lot of time playing racing sim games already.\n\u2705You want pro racing features: All the feedback and pedal pressure you could want is in this wheel.\n\u2705You don't mind the set-up process: securing this on a table, desk, or other surface can be a bit annoying if it isn't a permanent feature. If you don't mind that kind of thing for the added fun it brings, go ahead!\n\u274cYou want something newer: While this is our favorite, and doesn't feel old, there are newer wheels that might be worth considering if you want the best of the best.\n\u274cMoney is no object: If you can afford more, there are arguably even better wheels like the Logitech G Pro. If you've got money that's burning a hole in your pocket, why not set your sights higher?\n\u274cYou don't spend a lot of time in racing games: Seriously, the faff of setting this up if you don't care that much about racing games will be tiresome. Your money might be better spent elsewhere.\nDesign & Features: All the bells and whistles you could want in a steering wheel are present here - that is, without going into astronomical price territory. There are dual-encoder controls, magnetic paddle gear shifters, as well as an LED display that can offer you important info while you're behind the wheel.\nPro features aren't enough though, and the T248 gives you plenty of room for customization. The brake pedal can be configured in four different pressure modes, and a total of 25 remappable buttons gives you a lot of horsepower to play with. If you compare the T248 with some of its rivals, you'll find some excellent specs and features for the money, and we think it hits a lovely sweet spot amongst the likes of Logitech's feature-rich wheels.\nPerformance: All in all, the sense of immersion created by the powerful motor and resistance settings in the Thrustmaster T248 speaks for itself. Some of the fancier features are still to be picked up by some titles, which is a shame. On the other hand, there's still plenty to dive into here. Whether it's Gran Turismo, F1, or another racer, a wheel like this will add so much to your gaming time. Unlike other options, this doesn't demand that you sell your actual real-world car to afford it.\nRead more: Thrustmaster T248 review\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | NA |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBest PS5 controller: FAQs\nHow to choose the best PS5 controller for you\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nPS5 controllers come in many different forms, and the best way to narrow down your search and get the most for your money is to work out what you'd use one for. Do you need a replacement daily driver because the DualSense has cracked under the pressure of your everyday use? Maybe a new DualSense is the one to go for.\nDo you want a pro controller to climb the ladders in your favorite games? If so, what type of game is it? We've detailed above which controllers are good for what type of game, so use that advice to narrow down your search.\nDo you have bigger or smaller hands? If you're on the larger side, maybe opt for the Nacon options rather than the Victrix ones, since these brands lean into different size preferences.\nMaybe you don't want a multiplayer controller, but you play singleplayer games to a high difficulty, and you want some back buttons to help you out. Maybe the DualSense Edge is the best one for you, since you'll still get all the haptic feedback and trigger resistance the PS5 is known for, but you'll gain the pro features of other gamepads on this list.\nOf course, the situational controllers will be worth their weight in gold if you spend a lot of time playing on the go, or playing a specific type of game. Racing games get better the more you play them with a wheel and pedal setup, and remote playing has never been easier thanks to mobile controllers and the PlayStation Portal.\nIs the PS5 DualSense controller worth it?\nSince a lot of PS5 versions of the latest games are designed with the DualSense's haptic feedback in mind, the DualSense can definitely be worth it - especially when playing first-party PlayStation games. Having said that, it has quite a few issues that the DualSense Edge improves upon. In our opinion, if you're looking for the best PS5 controller for multiplayer games, a third-party option like the Victrix Pro BFG is a much better option.\nAre PS5 Pro controllers worth it?\nWe'd argue that the best PS5 controllers with back buttons and extra features are definitely worth it, if you can afford them. Having extra mappable buttons provides so much extra functionality compared to a stock DualSense, and if you like to play competitive multiplayer games, these can give you a massive advantage. Other pro controllers will have extra features like trigger stops, custom thumbstick deadzones, and sometimes even modular designs that let you change their make-up to suit you and the game you're playing.\nWhat is the best PS5 controller to avoid stick drift?\nYou have a few options if you're looking to take stick drift out of the equation entirely. Firstly, you can buy a controller with Hall Sensor thumbsticks, like the Nacon Revolution 5 Pro. Alternatively, you can mod a regular DualSense or DualSense edge to have Hall Sensor thumbsticks in them. This will void your warranty though, and usually needs to be done by a third party (who we don't endorse and haven't had any dealings with). Controllers like the Victrix Pro BFG don't come with Hall sticks out of the box, but separate Hall Effect modules are available to purchase.\nWhat is the best 3rd party controller PS5?\nIn our opinion, the best PS5 controller overall is a third party one named the Victrix Pro BFG. It has a modular build so you can swap out the positioning of buttons and sticks, it has four back buttons, and plenty of thumbstick options to help you gear up for your favorite game. If you're looking for specific PS5 features and software integration, the DualSense Edge is a great option, although it's more expensive than the Victrix Pro BFG.\nWhat PS5 controllers do pros use?\nIf we had to guess, pro players who are looking for a competitive edge for their streams or tournaments are likely using a controller like the Victrix Pro BFG, the Razer Wolverine V2 Pro, or the Scuf Reflex range. These all have back buttons that allow for extra in-game functions than a typical DualSense will. If they're playing last gen games on PS5, they could also be using a PS4 pro controller, like the Nacon Revolution Unlimited, Razer Raiju, or Thrustmaster eSwap Pro.\nWhich PS5 controller version is best?\nTo begin with, we'd say that the DualSense is one of the best ways to experience PS5 games. A lot of games, especially first-party ones, are designed with the DualSense's bespoke features in mind, so it's got to be one of the best controllers for the console out there. Besides that, we can recommend the Scuf Reflex range, and the Victrix Pro BFG as solid alternatives. We'll soon be testing more models for the PS5 specifically, but there are also a myriad of great PS4 controllers that will work on PS5 if you play a lot of last-gen games.\nWhat colour of PS5 controller is best?\nThere really is no accounting for taste. After cries for a black version of the Ps5 and DualSense, there are likely many folks who would say that the sleek, classy design of the controller is accentuated by the Midnight Black colour, although it really comes down to preference. The DualSense comes in Nova Pink, Original White, Cosmic Red, Starlight Blue, Galactic Purple, Grey Camouflage, and in a limited edition God of War Ragnarok design.\nWhy do you need back buttons?\nBack buttons are an incredibly useful addition to video game controllers, since they let you have more functionality that isn't controlled by your thumbs. For example, in competitive FPS games, you don't want to take control away from the movement or camera stick, so having back buttons lets you complete actions in the game without losing out on movement. This helps to bring console players a little closer to the performance of mouse and keyboard.\nHow we test the best PS5 controllers\nTesting controllers begins with unboxing. This is the early impression stage where we get the device out of its packaging and get a feel for it in the hands. Even without playing games with it, I'll ask how comfortable it is to hold - does it feel natural, smooth, or angular? How heavy is it? These are all things that will inform gaming performance later, so it's good to get an idea for them right away. It's also important to lay out how much you get for your money in this stage, and often, unboxing will be when we go through any attachments or cases that come along with the controller.\nThen, it's onto testing. I'll usually make whichever pad I'm reviewing the one I use for all my gaming time until I'm ready to write up my thoughts. That means we'll test across various titles depending on what's relevant, but there are a few games that exist to give us some objective tests. Celeste is a great barometer for platforming precision, so I'll load up some levels of that, and see how the controller helps or hurts me while climbing one of gaming's most hazardous mountains. For first-person shooter accuracy, I'll play Hunt: Showdown. This is the game I've played most of in my life, and my settings never change, so it's a great way to objectively test each new controller and scout out its FPS potential.\nBeyond those games, we'll always find a fighting game, a third-person action/adventure, a racing game, and other miscellaneous titles to test with. We'll assess a controller's battery life, back buttons, and durability from continuous testing. If a pad does come with attachments we can swap out, we'll use these to measure how versatile it can be.\nFor more on how we test the latest controllers, take a gander at our hardware policy.\nWhile you're at it, why not kit out more of your set-up with the best PS5 accessories? alternatively, get a noteworthy upgrade with one of the best TVs for PS5 and Xbox Series X.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension."

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nThe Razer Kishi V3 Pro feels far too similar to the Kishi Ultra, which released only a year ago. It might have improved aspects that make it a better investment overall, but its carried-over price of $149 still feels very inflated for the mobile controller market. Yes, it\u2019s one of the largest and most comfortable on-the-go gamepads I\u2019ve used. Its back buttons, TMR thumbsticks, and clicky responsiveness are standout features that set it apart from the competition. Unfortunately, it still isn\u2019t a better all-rounder than the GameSir G8 Galileo, even if you\u2019re playing with particularly large hands.\nPros\n- +\nExcellent size\n- +\nVarying size/price options in the range\n- +\nGreat back buttons\n- +\nClicky buttons make it feel like a Wolverine V3\n- +\nTMR thumbsticks\n- +\nPC compatibility\nCons\n- -\nPro and XL options are so expensive\n- -\nFeels far too similar to the Kishi Ultra\n- -\nPortability suffers from the larger size\n- -\nOffset thumbsticks undermine the comfort\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nRazer\u2019s controller division has some solid momentum behind it at the moment. Its recent redesign of the Wolverine line led to two of the best gamepads I\u2019ve reviewed this year, and last summer, it came out with the Razer Kishi Ultra, one of the best mobile controllers ever made. What\u2019s more, the Wolverine V3 controllers didn\u2019t have the completely obnoxious prices we\u2019ve seen from this brand before, signaling that a corner had maybe been turned. It hadn\u2019t.\nRazer is now back for more of the portable market, conveniently timed to upset the Backbone Pro and the launch excitement of the Switch 2. But how much could have really changed in a year?\nNo, I\u2019m actually asking you: How much could have changed since the launch of the Razer Kishi Ultra? Besides a few updated design flourishes and an expanded range of size options, I\u2019m having trouble working it out.\nThe new Razer Kishi V3 Pro I\u2019m testing has made tiny adjustments over last year\u2019s Kishi Ultra, and even though I\u2019m a big fan of the physical improvements, the biggest issue was always its $149 price. For context, my favorite mobile controller on the shelves right now is still the GameSir G8 Galileo, because it outguns the Kishi Ultra, the Backbone, and all the others in terms of value for money at just $79.99.\nThankfully, pricing isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. The Kishi V3 line includes a standard model, which only costs $99.99 - a real thorn in the paw of the original Backbone One and the Scuf Nomad. It\u2019s bigger than the Kishi V2, it has back buttons, and it feels like the best option in the bunch. The V3 Pro is the one I\u2019m testing, however, and although it has more functionality, I can\u2019t pretend the small improvements remedy the $149 price we know from last year. Then there\u2019s the Kishi V3 Pro XL for larger tablet devices, and its $199 price is just as unwieldy as the large tablets it\u2019s designed for.\nDesign\nIf you missed the Razer Kishi Ultra from last year, allow me to fill you in on the broad design strokes. The Kishi V3 line takes a much larger approach to the mobile controller market, essentially giving you full-sized controller grips and a less portable form factor, but a lot more comfort. I\u2019m yet to try anything designed for mobile play that replicates a full-sized controller more than the Kishi Ultra, and now the Kishi V3 Pro.\nThe differences between last year\u2019s model and this new one, though, aren\u2019t exactly numerous. The two back buttons are an immediately noticeable addition, a broader spine to help cradle your phone feels more stable, and the RGB strips that framed the Ultra\u2019s facial features are no more. Besides those, the dimensions, weight, and feel of the two controllers are virtually identical.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nThe Kishi V3 will fit and work with any Android or iPhone using a UCB-C connection. The V3 Pro will fit those devices, plus the iPad Mini, and any other USB-C gadget up to 8 inches. The XL model will only be for full-sized iPads and Android tablets up to 13 inches.\nAs great as the extra size of the Kishi V3 Pro is compared to other mobile pads, there\u2019s a design flaw that totally undermines it. When you take a look at a regular, full-sized gamepad, you\u2019ll notice that, regardless of whether it has asymmetrical or symmetrical thumbsticks, its face buttons and thumbsticks are positioned diagonally from one another. In other words, the buttons aren\u2019t directly under the thumbsticks, like they are on one of the Nintendo Switch 2\u2019s Joy-Cons, for example. Mobile controllers can often give you thumb cramp and discomfort because their facial components are vertically set. You have to completely flex your thumb and move it too far down to be comfortable for longer periods.\nSymmetrical thumbsticks can go a long way to remedying that issue. With those, you\u2019re not spending the majority of time playing with your thumb in that position; you\u2019re only tapping buttons before moving it back to the stick. The Kishi V3 Pro, being larger, does use bigger buttons and thumbsticks than most typical mobile controllers do, but it doesn\u2019t use its extra size to move that vertical separation far enough into a diagonal. The X button is still positioned directly above the thumbstick where, ideally, it\u2019d be a little further over to the side. While your hands have a more natural hold on the Kishi V3 Pro thanks to girthy grips, it can feel just as annoying to use in longer sessions as smaller controllers, particularly if you\u2019re playing aim-heavy games like FPS titles.\nIn my mind, a Kishi V3 Pro that improves upon the Kishi Ultra should have been screaming out for symmetrical thumbsticks like the Scuff Nomad has, like the Steam Deck OLED has, or like the Nitro Deck+ has. As it is, the Kishi V3 feels like it\u2019s catering to players, like me, who have larger hands, but it doesn\u2019t stick the landing because it doesn\u2019t use the space where it counts.\nFeatures\nPerhaps the biggest win for the Kishi V3 line, in my opinion, is the inclusion of TMR thumbsticks. These are slowly emerging as the controller market continues into 2025, but for those who aren\u2019t aware, they\u2019re an advancement over the Hall sensor technology we\u2019ve been seeing in recent years. They can chart even more coordinates on a grid, and do so at much faster speeds. In FPS games, that means more accurate aim, less latency, and an ongoing immunity to stick drift.\nThe tops of these thumbsticks can be pulled off and replaced with the two replacements in the box, which is a nice touch, and calls back to the GameSir X3 for those mobile players who still want a modular controller.\nThe Kishi V3 Pro sports the same additional bumper buttons as the Kishi Ultra and Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, but it now also has two back buttons, which I felt the Ultra from 2024 was screaming out for. That makes the Kishi V3 Pro one of, if not the only, mobile pad out there with four extra buttons to make use of. That\u2019s a big win for competitive players who don\u2019t want to lose out on functionality when they\u2019re away from home.\nRazer Kishi V3 | Razer Kishi V3 Pro | Razer Kishi V3 Pro XL |\n|---|---|---|\nFull-Sized but Compact Form Factor for USB Type C Phones | Full-Sized Form Factor for Phones and iPad Mini | Full-sized form factor for full-sized tablets |\nPro-Grade Console Controls and Ergonomic | Pro-Grade Console Controls and Ergonomics | Pro-Grade Console Controls and Ergonomics |\nFull-Sized TMR Thumbsticks | Full-Sized TMR Thumbsticks with Swappable Cap | Full-Sized TMR Thumbsticks with Swappable Caps |\nQuiet Tactile Buttons, 4-Way D-pad, and Hall Effect Triggers | Mecha-Tactile Actions Buttons, 8-Way D-pad, and Hall Effect Triggers | Mecha-Tactile Actions Buttons, 8-Way D-pad, and Hall Effect Triggers |\nUSB C, 3.5mm Audio, Pass Through Charging | USB C, 3.5mm Audio, Pass Through Charging | USB C, 3.5mm Audio, Pass Through Charging |\nNo haptics | Razer Sensa HD Haptics | Razer Sensa HD Haptics |\nExpanded Case Compatibility | Expanded Case Compatibility | Expanded Case Compatibility |\nWired Play on PC and iPad | Wired Play on PC and iPad | Wired Play on PC and iPad |\nLike the 2024 model, the Kishi V3 controllers also act as a PC controller thanks to USB-C connectivity. Plugging in works seamlessly with PC games, and this is actually how I did a big chunk of my testing. The same USB socket also has passthrough charging capabilities when in mobile play. Behind that, there\u2019s room for a 3.5mm headphone jack.\nAlong for the ride is Razer\u2019s own Nexus launcher, which is its answer to the Backbone app. This has some benefits to it, like the ability to record gameplay and share it, Virtual Controller mode, which lets you use the V3 for touchscreen-only titles on mobile, and remote play from a PC. All that, and it\u2019s free to use, unlike Backbone\u2019s app.\nRazer Sensa HD Haptics feature in the V3 Pro and XL models, but not in the regular V3. Razer also pulled in its mechanical mouse click switches for the buttons, and everything from the back buttons to the bumpers, to the face buttons all have a satisfying, speedy click to them. Inside the box, you\u2019ll find three sets of rubberized feet that provide compatibility with various iPhone and Android devices with or without cases.\nPerformance\nI had a real feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when testing the Kishi V3 Pro, and that\u2019s how I know this new model doesn\u2019t change enough from last year\u2019s outing. The good news is that last year\u2019s outing was pretty darn good. Its thicker, longer grips do a lot to make mobile play more comfortable during longer sessions than the Kishi V2. Its clicky buttons feel speedy and responsive, but it doesn\u2019t miss out on feedback thanks to the Sensa HD Haptics. It is, as it stands, one of the best ways to enjoy mobile games in this day and age, especially if you have larger hands.\nI\u2019d like to give a special mention to the TMR thumbsticks. They do an amazing job of making this feel like a full-sized pro controller I\u2019d be happy to use in competitive, sweaty Hunt: Showdown sessions. I\u2019ve said it before, but the micro-adjustments, the sensitivity, it all feels so much better than any other stick module I\u2019ve used in FPS games. The shape of the triggers is more slimline than a lot of full-sized controllers, which gives it a really distinct feeling.\nThe crunchy haptics are excellent in games like Celeste, and give me all the immersive feedback I need. I still think the floaty D-Pad Razer uses is a little odd. It feels more like it\u2019s sliding into the direction you\u2019re pushing, and it\u2019s the only part of the V3 Pro that feels spongy as opposed to immediately clicky and responsive.\nI also enjoy that you don\u2019t need to download an app to map the V3 Pro\u2019s back buttons; the Nexus button doubles as a function button for this, and it streamlines your ability to play on the go.\nComfort is a big win here if you do lean on back buttons as heavily as I do. They remove a lot of the need for your thumbs to sit in that uncomfortable position I talked about earlier for long stretches of time. The well-rounded grips are exactly what some portable gaming devices are missing these days, and if you aren\u2019t a fan of the flat back on the Switch 2, you\u2019ll find this a lot easier to hold safely. On the other hand, using it as a PC controller will never not feel odd to me because its spine can\u2019t shrink down or be removed. I still really enjoyed using it in this way, and there aren\u2019t many mobile pads I\u2019d be willing to actually spend time with on a stay-at-home device when I have other full-sized pro controllers at my disposal.\nShould you buy the Razer Kishi V3 Pro?\nThe Razer Kishi Ultra has been dropping in price for the last six months or so. I\u2019ve noticed more and more regularly that it\u2019s been getting discount after discount, which to me signals that the brand could be struggling to shift units in a market where it\u2019s charging $50 more than the majority of the competition. Then, just as Backbone launches a pro model that\u2019s slightly larger and has back buttons for $169.99, Razer launches three new mobile controllers of its own. The regular V3 priced at $99.99 will no doubt be an excellent investment, but the inflated price of the two larger models is not suddenly justified because another brand decides to charge as much. If I were you, I\u2019d wait until the V3 Pro inevitably comes down in price, because these big brands are soon going to realise (again) that they\u2019re still charging far too much for what most people can afford to spend on a mobile controller.\nLet me be clear: The Kishi V3 Pro is great - it improves upon the Kishi Ultra, which was already a brilliant mobile controller. That\u2019s why this review is difficult. It feels worthy of a slightly higher score than the Kishi Ultra, but Razer\u2019s stubborn pricing throws a big green spanner in the works. It just doesn\u2019t do enough to really feel like a new product. As a result, it seems like an excuse for Razer to slowly phase out the Kishi Ultra, once again charge a premium of $149, and now seem like the more affordable alternative to the Backbone Pro.\nI had as comfortable a hold on the GameSir G8 Galileo as I do here. You also get a more intuitive USB-C connector that pivots, and shoving it in your bag is so much easier due to its smaller form factor. That best-of-the-best option can even Remote Play PS5 games, which is something I never managed with Razer\u2019s. Oh, and did I mention that you still get two back buttons and save $70 versus the Kishi V3 Pro? If you really want the biggest and baddest mobile controller, pay for Razer\u2019s, but I think the G8 still wins the all-rounder battle.\nHow I tested the Razer Kishi V3 Pro?\nI put the Razer Kishi V3 Pro to work over a matter of weeks of testing. In that time, I used it for all my mobile gaming needs, as well as a big chunk of my PC play time. Naturally, I compared my experience closely to the Kishi Ultra controller, and used my experience of tracking its price for the last year to give an analysis in this review.\nI played games across multiple genres for this review, including Hunt: Showdown 1896, Clair Obscur, Celeste, Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, and the Hell is Us Demo.\nFor more on how we test controllers, check out the full GamesRadar+ Hardware Policy.\nIf you're looking for a controller for your dedicated platform, why not check out the best PS5 controllers, the best Xbox Series X controllers, or the best Nintendo Switch controllers?\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "The best PC controller for gaming 2025\nStay competitive and get comfortable with the best PC controllers for gaming right now\nControllers were probably the first piece of gaming hardware that I got properly nerdy about, so I take great pleasure in testing the latest ones out. I've had the privilege of testing all of the biggest and best controller releases in the last two years, and I have plenty of experience with models that came before that too. I'm sick of hearing that a controller can't keep up with a keyboard and mouse, so I'm on a mission to find ones that can. Outside of the competitive scene, the right controller can add comfort and enhance the feel of your favorite games, so they're a worthwhile investment in my opinion. Let's find the one for you.\nIf you're shopping around for the best PC controllers in 2025, it's an exciting month to do so. We've had a new GameSir controller launch, which is always exciting for those players looking for the best value for money. We've also had a new launch from Azeron about a new keypad that combines the best parts of a keyboard and a controller into one device - this time with actual keyboard keys.\nThere are so many great controllers out there right now, from the budget and value options that still pack a serious punch with comfort, anti-stick drift sticks, and back buttons. But there's also plenty of officially licensed (albeit pricier) pro controllers from the bigger brands. I've pulled all of the best options into one helpful list for you. I've tested almost all of these myself, from the best PS5 controllers to the best Xbox Series X controllers. The good news is, there are so many options in front of you so that you can find the best controller for your needs.\nToday's pro controllers pack a whole host of customization features, including extra mappable buttons, and even the ability to swap out whole components thanks to modular designs. Along with your purchase, you'll usually get conclusive software that lets you control the essential parts of your gamepad, with some letting you set custom dead zones for the analog sticks. In short, there are so many ways to stay competitive if you prefer playing with a controller, so let's dive into the options I'd recommend in 2025.\nThe quick list\nBest overall\nWith excellent customization options and a competitive price point, the Victrix Pro BFG is the gamepad to beat right now - its new Xbox version may even be an improvement.\nBest budget\nThe EasySMX X10 screams value with its micro-switch buttons, magnetic faceplates, Hall Sensor thumbsticks, ergonomic back buttons, and snappy feel.\nBest keyboard alternative\nIf you want the functionality of a keyboard combined with the thumbstick movement of a controller, the Azeron Cyborg 2 is the ultimate way to play games.\nBest value\nThe GameSir Cyclone 2 is a popular pick at the moment, and for good reason. It packs a lot of great features, and for a fairly affordable package, it does a lot well.\nBest symmetrical\nThere aren't many pro controllers these days with symmetrical thumbsticks, but the GameSir Tarantula Pro is one of the best gamepads overall right now.\nBest for speed\nPacked with speedy Esports mouse switches and refined back button placement, the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is easily the fastest controller you can buy right now.\nLoad the next 2 products \u2193\nBest Hall Effect\nThere are plenty of Hall Effect controllers out there these days, but barely any do it better than the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited thanks to a truly premium feel.\nBest for game feel\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra has some amazing feedback for a gamepad without haptic feedback. Its microswitch buttons go a long way too.\nBest for Xbox fans\nThe Elite Series 2 has reigned supreme in the premium PC controller space for a while now, but it still impresses today with its customization options and flexibility.\nBest for PS5 fans\nIf you're after something that will remind you of younger days on PlayStation consoles, the DualSense Edge packs in an excellent feature set and has nice customization too.\nBest interactive screen\nMost controllers that have a screen don't make the most of it, but the Manba One has a seriously impressive customization suite under its hood if you don't want to hook up to a PC to change settings.\nJuly 31, 2025: I had planned to add the GameSir G7 Pro to the list this month as I feel it offers even more value for money than the GameSir Cyclone 2. Unfortunately, my review has arrived a tad early, and the pad hasn't actually hit the shelves yet. GameSir is usually very efficient at getting its new products on the shelves as soon as they drop, so I suspect it'll be available in the next month. Until then, I've kept the Cyclone 2 where it is, but I'd expect it to be swapped out for the G7 Pro in the next update of this guide.\nThe best PC controller overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe original Victrix Pro BFG launched at the beginning of 2023 for PS5, PS4, and PC, but it's since made its way to Xbox with a version that might even be superior if you aren't looking for a controller to use with Sony's console as well as your computer. Since this has been on the shelves, it's been our clear favorite for anyone who wants the maximum performance out of a gamepad.\n\u2705You want a controller you can change depending on the game: with a modular design, anything is possible, and you can literally change the face of this product depending on your needs, and the game you're playing with it.\n\u2705You plan to get competitive: While you can absolutely use this gamepad for more relaxed sessions, this is perfect for anyone who wants to maximise their own performance.\n\u2705You want near-perfect back buttons: Without going for magnetic back paddles found on official controllers, these are some of the most ergonomic and best-feeling back buttons ever designed.\n\u274cYou don't need back buttons: If you don't need all the pro features and swappable features the BFG gives you, you'll probably find more comfort in a different controller.\n\u274cYou value style: This controller certainly looks pretty enough, but again, if you want a more conventional design that's easy on the eye, look elsewhere.\n\u274cYou won't ever swap the parts around: One of the best parts about this controller is its adjustability, and if you're not the sort of player who's up for experimenting with different layouts to find the best feel, you might as well spend elsewhere.\nDesign & Features: This controller is designed with elite performance in mind, and thanks to its amazing modular design, you can tailor it to your exact preferences thanks to the suite of attachments that come in its case. Among them are a taller analog stick for precision aiming, multiple D-pad choices, stick gates, and a fightpad module that gives you six face buttons. The facial modules can also be flipped around so the sticks are symmetrical if that's your thing.\nPerformance: The PS5 version can feel pretty lightweight in the hands and has absolutely no rumble or haptic feedback. It's a controller that's bred to get the best performances out of you in whatever game you play, not providing luxurious feedback as you play. The Xbox version, on the other hand, has rumble, which gives it a previously missing feeling of heft in the hands, as well as a real quality of life bonus. Either can be used wirelessly - even the Xbox version, which is still rare for gamepads that are officially licensed for Microsoft's console.\nThe BFG has four back buttons that are as comfortable as they are useful, as well as a clever \"Tournament Lock\" mode that stops you from pressing the system buttons during competition, which could result in disqualification. During tests, there wasn't a single game we could throw it at and not have a good time with.\nIn terms of value for money, this is absolutely one of the best controllers to hit the shelves in recent years, especially when you consider that it's cheaper than its competition in the PS5 controller arena.\nRead more: Victrix Pro BFG for Xbox review\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best budget PC controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe EasySMX certainly doesn't have an easy job. It's in a super competitive price bracket that's stocked full of budget options, but it has to stick out from the crowd and still come across as a premium option that's worth buying. That's exactly what it does, and the online reviews as well as our own experience attests to that.\n\u2705You want microswitch buttons: This controller has some of the best-feeling microswitch buttons on the market, and that means a glorious mix of speed and feel.\n\u2705You like an Xbox feel: There's a traditional Xbox shape and feel to this pad, which will suit some players more than others.\n\u2705You have smaller hands: Players with bigger hands will be able to use this as well, but the tighter feel of this product lends itself to folks with smaller ones.\n\u274cYou want accessories: There's no thumbstick tops to change, or a carry case here. The EasySMX X10 offers a different type of value.\n\u274cGameSir's controllers appeal to you more: There's no denying that this brand feels like a direct competitor to GameSir, which makes similar controllers that are even cheaper than this.\n\u274cYour budget goes higher than this: Bigger brands offer more if you're willing to spend a bit more, even if this is great for its price point.\nDesign & Features: If you're in the market for micro-switch buttons, your options are limited in the controller world. Sure, Razer has plenty of choices for you, but the buttons that brand uses have a spongy quality that doesn't exactly match the tactile speed gamers are looking for. The GameSir T4 Kalied is another option, but if you want extra aesthetic options, wireless capability, or Bluetooth, the X10 wins out in terms of value. You also get two back buttons here, as well as some swappable faceplates and grips.\nPerformance: When we tested it out, we were amazed at the brilliant feel and overall value this gamepad had to offer. The EasySMX X10 is one of those rare controllers that makes the biggest brands look bad. It offers a premium feel for a fraction of the price the big names charge. Particularly if you like micro-switch buttons and an Xbox controller shape, don't overlook this.\nThat traditional Xbox feel fits a smaller pair of hands really nicely with this pad, and that helps to make this feel like a controller you can take on the go. Sadly, there aren't as many accessories and add-ons in this controller's box compared to other pro controllers on this list. You get Hall Sensor thumbsticks out of the box, but you won't be able to adjust their heights or topper shapes. Customization is something that will hopefully improve over time since when we tested the X10 EasySMX's PC app was still in Beta. Either way, the value for money you get here for a premium feel and microswitch speed is up there with the best.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best keyboard alternative\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFor a lot of PC gamers, the need for a decent pro controller comes from the fact they've never felt at home using the WASD inputs of a traditional gaming keyboard. If you also find keyboards unruly and long for simple thumbstick movement, you need to know about the Azeron Cyborg II.\n\u2705You're up for something a bit different: There's no denying that re-learning and creating custom profiles can be a bit of a faff - more than with any of the other controllers on this list that can be used out of the box. If you're up for re-learning, and adjusting the heights and angles of each tower, then this is for you.\n\u2705You want a personalized look: There are loads of ways to customize the look of your keypad, so if you want something fully designed by you, it doesn't get much better than this.\n\u2705You want the best of both worlds: The Cyborg II combines the thumbstick movement of a controller with the speed and functionality of a keyboard. Not to mention, you'll be using a mouse with it too. This really is the best hybrid of a controller and a traditional PC setup.\n\u274cRelearning and creating profiles is a faff: If you're not a fan of creating custom profiles and learning a new way to play, then this may not be the controller for you.\n\u274cYou only play 2D platformers or fighting games: There's so much functionality to be had here, so if you only play platformers with four of five player actions, this might be overkill.\n\u274cYou can't stand using a mouse, and don't want to learn: If you're used to using a controller to aim, and you've never liked using a mouse, then this may not be your best option.\nDesign & Features: Okay, I'm going to level with you. The Azeron Cyborg II is a fully customizable gaming keypad that admittedly looks like nothing else on the market, let alone this list. Because it is wholly unique, it comes with a learning curve at first, but having come through that now, I promise you that it's worth exploring, because you'll soon find that there are few methods of interacting with video games that feel as intuitive as this.\nThe idea is that with one hand, you rest your hand in this ergonomic robot claw and use a mouse with your other. The thumbstick on the keypad will give you the movement you're familiar with from a controller, but the 30 other inputs that are all a finger's twitch away are totally up to you to assign to the in-game functions that work best for you. Using intuitive software that makes creating controller schemes simple, you can set up personalized maps. You can create a catch-all profile for all your games, store up to six different profiles for individual games on the keypad's internal storage, or even use the community's created profiles to copy someone else's homework.\nThe updated Cyborg II makes a few vital improvements over the original Cyborg range. These include a Hall Sensor thumbstick to avoid wear and tear, improved top-tower designs, updated Omron switches for a more substantial feel, and the capability for up to a 1000Hz polling rate.\nPerformance: Comfort here is truly unparalleled because the Cyborg II is so adjustable. You can change the angles, tilt, length, and gaps between each finger's set of keys. You can order the keypad for a right hand, and even opt for different sizes and shapes of the palm rest.\nEach key feels so tactile to use, and for me, they add so much more game feel than any keyboard ever has. Since I never need to move my fingers off of their designated positions, I feel so much quicker when using the Cyborg II - and that's actually true when I look at my speedrunning times in Dishonored, which are so much quicker now I've learned the ropes of Azeron's incredible product.\nThis may have been bred for first-person shooting games, but it's so much more versatile than that, offering great potential in third-person games with loads of inputs. Games like Helldivers 2 feel right at home thanks to the 30 keys that are right at your fingertips. I do sometimes wish the build quality was a bit stronger. With each keypad being 3D printed to order, you do feel customization gets slightly in the way of a robust build. Still, there's no way around the innovation and excellence of this keypad.\nQuite simply, it's one of the best gaming peripherals I've ever used.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | NA |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best value PC controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEditor's note: Hold up! Value hunters might want to know about this...\nHello friends, I just wanted to leave a quick note to say that this month, I've tested the GameSir G7 Pro, which isn't readily available yet and so doesn't appear on this list, but I'd argue it's actually better value than the Cyclone 2. If you're thinking about getting the most bang for your buck, I'd wait until the G7 Pro is on the shelves (I'll update this page when it is). If you need something right away, the Cyclone 2 doesn't miss much, but personally, I think the G7 Pro is the better product.\nRead more: GameSir G7 Pro review\nThe GameSir Cyclone 2 feels like the quintessential GameSir controller. It crams as many features as possible into a comfortable pro gamepad with two back buttons, and lets you get your hands on it for a super reasonable price. The Cyclone 2 manages to do that with some really futureproofed features, as well as a look that'd make anyone take it seriously.\n\u2705You want a solid all-rounder: The Cyclone 2 isn't the winner in any one category, but that means it's a versatile pad you can use in a myriad of gaming genres.\n\u2705You're on a tight budget: The price of this controller is great for the features it gives you. If you're trying to save money, this is your stop.\n\u2705You still want the best thumbsticks out there: TMR thumbsticks are legit. Believe the hype, and invest in one of these if you want stick drift immunity and incredible precision.\n\u274cYou want a hefty gamepad: The Cyclone 2 feels quite light in the hands, so if you're a fan of heavier controllers, this isn't for you.\n\u274cYou want more than two back buttons: In true GameSir fashion, this controller only comes with two back buttons, so if you were hoping for more, look elsewhere.\n\u274cA modular design is important to you: This controller doesn't come with any swappable parts.\nDesign & Features: The Cyclone 2 feels very similar to GameSir's Kaleid controllers. In fact, there are very few differences in their shapes and sizes. They even share the same slightly transparent aesthetic, with RGB linework that gives the peripheral a distinct flash of personality. Clicky microswitch buttons do add a touch of speed, but I'm not the biggest fan of the squeaky noises I was hearing from them, only a couple of hours into testing. Two back buttons are a classic GameSir feature, and they're placed perfectly here as usual. They have a large size to them as well, which makes them super easy to find, but they do lead me to ask why the designers didn't decide to use the same amount of space to squeeze in an extra pair. It'd take this pad up to a whole other level of value.\nThe big draw for me here is the TMR thumbsticks. These are still fairly new (at the time of writing), and they make a massive difference in any game. In first-person shooters, especially, I felt as though I had so much more room for accuracy and tiny, precise aiming adjustments. You'll also get a charging stand with this controller, which can be nice and convenient if you tend to play wirelessly. It has a distinct design too, and a slot to hold your USB dongle so it doesn't get lost.\nPerformance: There's no real genre where the Cyclone 2 excels, and I feel that's by design. GameSir isn't designing controllers like these around one gamer or another, it's building versatile tools you can use in whichever virtual adventure you turn them to. That said, I can't understate how much of a difference the TMR thumbsticks are.\nIn FPS games, they allow for so much accuracy, and especially if you prefer to play with no deadzones like me, there's a lot of scope to aim speedily and aim well. But unexpectedly, they make the Cyclone 2 super viable for 2D platformers. The 4-way D-pad feels a little limited in truth, but the thumbsticks feel like they can be used in its place.\nIt's a shame there isn't more of a heavyweight feeling to this controller, and that doesn't go that extra step toward an Esports pad by packing in extra back buttons. These are things that could catapult it into the spotlight of this list. Then again, it's hard to argue with the price the Cyclone charges for some really great comfort and features.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best controller with symmetrical thumbsticks\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt's not often you find modern pro controllers that use a symmetrical thumbstick layout, but I'd argue they're as viable as the Xbox configuration, and always have been. Not only does the Tarantula Pro have symmetrical thumbsticks, but it's only the second controller on the shelves to sport TMR thumbstick modules, which gives it a lot of futureproofing. Combined with its myriad other features, this is a force to be reckoned with.\n\u2705You prefer symmetrical thumbsticks: If you've always preferred the PlayStation controller design, this is one for you.\n\u2705You want one of the best value controllers available: For its price under $100 / \u00a3100, this is packed full of great features.\n\u2705Comfort is important to you: One of the biggest wins of the Tarantula Pro is its supreme comfort in longer sessions.\n\u274cYou want four back buttons: There are two back buttons and five extra face buttons to map here, but those who want four back buttons need to look elsewhere.\n\u274cYou prefer offset thumbsticks: It goes without saying, but if you like your controllers Xbox-shaped, you have the choice of almost any other controller on this list\n\u274cYou want microswitch buttons: The membrane face buttons here are great, but they don't have the speed of microswitches some players might be looking for.\nDesign & Features: You probably don't need me to tell you that this controller has been designed to look and feel exactly like the PS4's DualShock 4, albeit with a modern twist. It is almost exactly the same shape as the PS4's forgotten gem of a gamepad, but it does have a bit more girth in its grips resulting in a bit more comfort and heft. Instead of the usual touchpad in the middle however, the Tarantula Pro has a smaller one that's framed by some extra face buttons you can program to whatever functions you like.\nOn the back, you'll find trigger stops and back buttons, adding a bit more to what is a very comfortable controller shape. TMR thumbsticks are a standout feature, and one worth investing in since they felt super accurate in FPS games, and the switching face buttons complement the Tarantula's multiplatform capability. In terms of customization, GameSir's latest \"Connect\" software lets you dig into the deepest details to get the most out of the gamepad.\nIf you're willing to pay a little more, you can also get the version with the charging stand, which is a really nice touch and adds some convenience and ease of display. With the onboard RGB in this controller, you'll likely find it's one you want to show off.\nPerformance: There weren't any glaring weaknesses in the Tarantula Pro when I tested it. In every genre of game, it provides a comfortable, precise, and speedy tool that'll set you up for success. It is a shame that it only has two back buttons as an extra pair would really catapult this into vying for the top spot on this list. Even with its extra face buttons though, it does a brilliant job at providing value for money.\nThe membrane face buttons are decent and feel reminiscent of the DualShock 4 this was clearly designed to emulate. Microswitches do add a bit more speed, but I'm not sure how I would have felt about these being used. I say this not to point out a flaw, but to draw attention to it for anyone who knows they have microswitch buttons on their desired features list.\nIf, like me, you loved the DualShock 4 and want a bit more bang for your buck than the DualSense Edge offers, this is a truly brilliant controller to buy. It is hands-down one of the best I've tested in the last few years.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | Around 10 hours |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best PC controller for speed\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDo you constantly feel as though you're a step behind other players in your lobby? If so, the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro was designed to give you the boost you desire. This is the latest and greatest iteration of Razer's Wolverine controller family, and it's blown the previous versions out of the water with excellent refinements and a focus on speed.\n\u2705You want something that will stand the test of time: The build quality here is hard to match on this list, and the lengths Nacon has gone to to ensure a long lifespan is commendable.\n\u2705Back buttons aren't the main feature you're buying for: The back buttons on the R5P aren't positioned brilliantly, and take a lot of force to push in. They aren't the best ones out there.\n\u2705You also play on PS5: This controller is also designed for PS5 gaming, so if you split your time between the platforms, this is a solid option.\n\u274cYou're on a budget: The R5P is a bit pricier than some of the other officially licensed console controllers on this list, so keep that in mind while you're browsing.\n\u274cYou need good back buttons: If you want back buttons that are easy to press and simple to find, maybe look at the Victrix Pro BFG instead.\n\u274cYou hate loose thumbstick tension: If you need tighter thumbstick tension, look elsewhere - seriously.\nDesign & Features: The Wolverine V3 fixes one of my biggest issues with the V2 Pro for PS5, and that was its back button placement. The V3 packs the same four back buttons and two extra bumpers as the Sony licensed model, offering more functionality than almost any other gamepad on the market. However, it integrates the back buttons into the controller's grips, making them so much more usable. Their switches taken directly from one of Razer's gaming mice give them so much responsiveness too.\nElsewhere you'll find a mix of membrane and microswitch buttons, all of which feel so quick to actuate with their signature clicky sounds. This is the first controller from Razer to ship with swappable thumbstick tops and a carry case as well. Joining the current trend of Xbox controllers, it also has wireless support which is a big win. When using a wired connection on a PC, you can make the most of a 1,000Hz polling rate too.\nPerformance: There isn't a faster controller than this. Playing twitch-shooters it feels so responsive, and thanks to a taller thumbstick attachment on top of a Hall Sensor module, it feels like you can be much more accurate than with previous Wolverine models. It is a shame that the deadzones are quite large out of the box, but at least you can customize these. In fighting games that require speedy actuation like Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, combos and button-mashing quick-time events were easy to pull off.\nAt the same time, platforming in Celeste was easy with all the extra utility. It is a shame that for all the refinements Razer's product designers made, they didn't increase the length of the grips at all. It has a traditional Wolverine feel to it, but the V3 does lack some comfort as a result. More, the wireless connectivity is a solid quality-of-life bonus, but the dongle isn't the strongest, and frequently stutters on me if something blocks the signal.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best Hall effect controller for PC\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you've been burned by stick drift before, I don't blame you for looking to invest in a controller that's immune to that particular form of controller cancer. The good news is that there are loads of Hall Effect controllers out there for PC these days. In fact, I'd be so bold as to say that most of the controllers on this list have Hall sensor thumbsticks in them, which means they use tiny electromagnetic sensors that won't ever wear down over time and suffer from stick drift.\nThe Nacon Revolution X Unlimited could have swept up a few awards on this list, but I finally decided to land it a place as the best Hall Effect controller for PC because it embodies what that technology is all about. This is a controller that's been built to last; it has a premium build quality, feels like it's worth the money you pay for it, and overall, it's one of the best controllers on the shelves right now.\n\u2705You want something that'll last: This controller has Hall effect thumbstick,s meaning it won't suffer from stick drift.\n\u2705You want a premium feel: I don't think there are any controllers that feel more worth their high price tags than Nacon's Revolution X Unlimited.\n\u2705You want something that's adjustable: This controller comes with a carrying case, adjustable weights, and a few more accessories.\n\u274cYou don't like loose stick tension: The thumbsticks of the Revolution X Unlimited might be immune to stick drift, but their tension is on the looser side.\n\u274cYou're already looking for TMR thumbstick tech: There's an even newer type of thumbstick tech that's more advanced, and a few TMR options are on this list already.\n\u274cYou don't need six extra buttons: If you want Hall thumbsticks but you're on a budget, there are loads of options from other brands.\nDesign & Features: If you're at all familiar with Nacon's previous Revolution pro controllers, you'll be greeted with a familiar sight here. The Revolution X Unlimited looks a lot like the Revolution 5 Pro, which launched for the PS5 a few years ago, and the Revolution Unlimited, which was a standout option last generation. It features broad shoulders, big, bold face buttons, and rubberized grips that make it stand out from a lot of the other gamepads on the shelves. The RXU takes things a step further, adding two extra shoulder buttons to the four back buttons we saw on previous models.\nYou may notice a new interactive screen on this pad, which, I'll admit, doesn't live up to the Manba One, but does enough to make itself useful. I do think Nacon has jumped on a bit of a trend in this instance, but having the menu at your fingertips can be useful, especially for turning on and off gyro aim. One of my favorite things about this gamepad is that it has beautifully tactile face buttons. They press in with an excellent membrane feel, but bounce and react to your presses quickly. They also click in thanks to microswitches that feel like a million dollars to use.\nYou also get a carrying case, cable, charging stand, and accessories for your money. It isn't a fully modular build, but being able to add weight to your grips in particular is a really nice option. I do wish there were more thumbstick tops, as the ones supplied feel quite limited.\nPerformance: As I move on to test other controllers, I'll definitely miss the Revolution X Unlimited. Its premium-feeling buttons embody the philosophy behind Hall sensor tech in controllers, in my opinion. They feel like they'll last a lifetime, but also feel like they're worth the money you've spent on them. If there was a drawback for me, it's got to be the loose thumbstick tension. This isn't my favorite, and if there were a way to adjust it, I'd be a lot happier to recommend this pad to competitive FPS players. I suppose six extra buttons will make up for that.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best PC controller for game feel\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra Wireless controller has so much tactility for a controller that doesn't officially feature haptic feedback. Microswitch buttons and really precise vibration make it exceptional for immersing you in the games you like to play. If you really want to get lost in the feeling of controlling your in-game avatars, then this is one to consider.\n\u2705You want great tactility: The accurate rumble here creates a beautiful layer of feedback when gaming, which can really help to immerse you in your games.\n\u2705You don't typically like back buttons: The back buttons here are laid out a little differently than usual, and thanks to their microswitch mechanics, I'm inclined to say these might win you over.\n\u2705You like the controller's look: There's a really distinct look about this pad, so if you're a fan of swanky RGB designs and an ob-board display, look no further.\n\u274cYou're looking to get competitive: The Victrix Pro BFG has more customization for the same price as this, so it's probably better for those players who are looking to top the online leaderboards.\n\u274cYou prefer traditional back buttons: Back buttons with a vertical layout are what's used most of the time, so if you prefer that, maybe look elsewhere.\n\u274cRGB isn't your thing: The look of this pad isn't for everyone. If you prefer a more plain approach to gamepad design, there are other options.\nDesign & Features: The design of this gamepad is beautiful. It's got RGB lines striking through its grips and framing its face, and some classy bronze panels that pair nicely with its black grips.\nWhat may be most appealing from a glance is this controller's facial display that helps you to control and customize its various settings. This is indeed a standout feature since it can make assigning the four truly innovative back buttons an absolute breeze. It'll also help you switch between the 10 savable profiles this controller can store. All of the Stealth Ultra's buttons are microswitch ones, and its triggers and thumbsticks have Hall Sensor tech inside them for extra longevity.\nYou get the usual connectivity of a pro controller here; a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C charging, but in your case, you get a small USB dongle and a small magnetic charging stand too. While you might not get the kind of assortments and attachments as some more Esports-specific controllers do, you do get some thumbstick toppers for your money, and these go a long way to correct the sub-par designs of the regular sticks.\nPerformance: What I love about this controller is that it does everything well. It isn't quite as good performance-wise as something from Victrix if you're looking to get competitive, but it isn't far off. Besides the BFG with its fully modular design, you'd be hard-pressed to find a controller that outperforms this. What's more, its 30-hour quoted battery life is accurate, and thanks to the charging stand, I never have to worry about it running out of charge.\nThe thing that really separates this controller from others is the intuitive back buttons, which have a horizontal layout. Normally, playing around with back button positioning can be a detriment, but they're placed really effectively here so you can access those extra in-game actions much easier.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best PC controller for Xbox fans\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Elite Series 2 has become a veteran of the controller market, and for a long time, it's what all other video game controllers were aspiring to be. I'd argue the field has now caught up, but that doesn't mean this experienced and battle-hardened controller isn't worth buying these days. On the contrary, it's still one of the best PC controllers out there.\n\u2705You want a premium controller: The Elite Series 2 is an amazing gamepad with such a great feel to it. Can a controller feel like sitting in a brand new sports ar If so, this is what that would feel like.\n\u2705You want pro features: The ability to completely remap this controller's button assignments is a big draw.\n\u2705You want magnetic back paddles: There's a difference between back buttons and back paddles, and this has the latter. If you want the most satisfying and comfortable ones on the market, you get four here.\n\u274cYou want something newer: Other controllers have caught up, and this isn't the be-all, end-all it once was. If you'd rather spend the money on something newer, it might suit you better.\n\u274cThe Xbox feel isn't for you: The Xbox shape isn't for everyone, so if you'd rather go for something a bit more distinct, there's no shame in it.\n\u274cYou have no need for the back paddles: The Elite Series 2 Core is a cheaper version of this pad without the add-ons and carry case, so that could save you money.\nDesign & Features: Included in the box are replacement thumbstick heads, a classic cross-design D-pad, and tools to tailor the feel of the controller to your liking - with physical adjustments to almost every part of the controller. Also to note, the extended 40-hour battery life - akin to the Switch Pro controller - a good 8-hour bump up from the Xbox Series X gamepad's lifespan between charges. We found that the recommended battery life from Microsoft largely rang true in our own testing.\nWe were pleased to find new textured grips covering the legs of the Series 2 version of the Elite controller, offering a low-profile tactile feel that didn't seem prone to wear or scratches during our romps with these buttons. We also found it particularly easy to swap in any of the alternative analog sticks or d-pad buttons.\nPerformance: However, we saw the greatest leaps in the software improvements under the hood. We were still able to fully remap each function, but there's plenty more going on here. You can assign system-level functions like taking a screenshot or opening up achievements in console play.\nThe Elite 2 is the alpha and omega in Xbox controllers, and its various add-ons are a reason why. Magnetic back paddles are seldom seen, but they do add a premium feel that gives the Elite Series 2 a big advantage over the other pro controllers on this list. If are on the lookout for a high-end controller and don't mind spending money on something a bit older, this is the controller for you. At least before we hear literally anything about the Elite Series 3.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAlso consider:\nThe Xbox Elite Series 2 Core takes the high quality of the full-fat Elite Series 2 and brings it down to a more affordable price point, making it one of the best PC controllers out there. If you want a premium controller with great software benefits and features, this is a great value gamepad. This is essentially the same great package you get with the Elite Series 2 - the main difference between the two is the accessories you get bundled along with them.\nUS: Buy at Amazon\nUK: Buy at Amazon\nThe best PC controller for PS5 fans\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe DualSense Edge is the first homemade pro controller from Sony, and wouldn't you know, it works with PC as well. It's a bit of a shame that ever since launch, the brand seems to have completely forgotten about it, not really supporting it with deals or new thumbstick modules, but for those who want the best official PlayStation controller they can get, it's a lovely gamepad to use.\n\u2705You like PlayStation controllers: Symmetrical thumbsticks are great, and there aren't many controller brands that provide products with them in mind.\n\u2705You play a lot of PlayStation games: Want the DualSense's intuitive features on PC? This is your best option.\n\u2705You want magnetic back paddles: This is one of the few back paddle options out there. Annoyingly though, there are only two slots to the Elite Series 2's four.\n\u274cPerformance is your main selling point: Getting competitive in the Esports scene will be better served by another controller.\n\u274cLongevity matters to you: The DualSense's thumbstick drift and trigger spring issues don't inspire the most confidence, and the Edge doesn't have the best solutions to those problems.\n\u274cYou don't need pro features: If you want the DualSense's haptics and trigger resistance on PC but don't need the extra software advantages, you can always buy a regular DualSense.\nDesign & Features: Rounded corners at the bottom of the grips, and an extra degree of weight make it so much comfier in the hands than the original DualSense, and smaller details like textured trigger surfaces do make it feel like a next step for PlayStation's flagship controller.\nThe two slots for magnetic back paddles are and excellent touch, and provide an extremely comfortable experience. In the box you get multiple back paddle attachments, which is a nice touch. Unfortunately, there are only two of them, which means for a similar price you can get a third party controllers that offer more.\nPerhaps most importantly, the DualSense Edge has a shorter battery life than the original DualSense, and doesn't truly fix its widespread stick drift issues. Although entire stick modules can be replaced, we'd have an easier time recommending it if there were genuine fixes built in.\nPerformance: Regardless of the shortcomings of its creator brand, the DualSense Edge is still a great controller for anyone playing on PC who wants a traditional PlayStation feel. If you play a lot of first-party Sony games, the Dualsense Edge will let you enjoy all the DualSense features you'd be getting while playing on PS5. More than that, it's an extremely comfortable controller to use in longer sessions as well.\nAdded software now allows you to customise a lot of the Edge's features on PC, which took a while to arrive if you bought one at launch. This isn't the last word in the pro controller world, especially for the money you pay, but it is an undeniably good controller that's worth considering.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best PC controller with an interactive screen\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nQuite a few controllers have launched lately that have an interactive screen on them, but to tell the truth, most of these are really just using it as a fancy gimmick. The Manba One is the first of these controllers to really wow me because it's bold enough to make its onboard display a front and central facial feature, and it allows for so much utility within it. Not only that, but for a price of circa $60/\u00a360, you get four back buttons, wireless connectivity, and a fun look.\n\u2705You don't want to hook up to a PC to customize features: With the power of this controller's onboard display, you can change all the settings you want just from using the controller.\n\u2705You want four back buttons: It can be tricky to find four back buttons at this price point.\n\u2705You want wireless connectivity: If you want to play wirelessly and get a charging stand for your money, this is a solid deal.\n\u274cYou want great build quality: The Manba One does have a fairly cheap, plastic feel to it, especially its back buttons.\n\u274cYou're looking for TMR thumbsticks: If you're looking for the latest thumbstick tech, you won't find it here.\n\u274cYou don't care about customization: If you wouldn't actually use the clever settings menu on this controller, there are better pads out there.\nDesign & Features: The whole controller is designed around that interactive screen, and while some might say that risks detracting from its play potential, I think it works brilliantly. The gamepad as a whole is still comfortable, its buttons are responsive enough, and its thumbsticks are sensitive Hall Effect ones.\nWith four back buttons and swappable thumbstics in the box, you do get plenty of pro utility out of this controller for any genre you want to get competitive in, and the charging stand not only keeps the battery level solid if you play wirelessly, but it creates a really nice look for putting the Manba One on display.\nPerformance: Controller displays so often suffer because they're difficult to navigate and their clunky, small size makes it more annoying to use than just plugging into a PC and customizing through a companion app. The Manba One's menu can be navigated so smoothly thanks to some function buttons that frame the bottom of its face. It's so clear to tell when the controller is in playing mode and when you're in the menu, and that's not a change you're going to accidentally make in the middle of a tense bit of gameplay action either. The screen feels responsive, and has all the settings you'd need - including deadzone customization graphs. Yes, it really is that in-depth. Programming back buttons assignments is a breeze, and there are plenty of profile settings to switch between too that actually feel more intuitive than function button combinations.\nAs a controller, four back buttons are always going to be a win, but the Manba One could definitely do with having a more premium build quality and fewer plastics used. The Hall thumbsticks are sensitive, which is a double-edged sword since they can sometimes be a bit unruly. Still, this is an excellent controller for the price, and one I can recommend easily to anyone who doesn't want to have to hook up to a PC every time they want to change settings around.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBest PC controller: FAQs\nHow to use an Xbox controller on PC\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nUsing your Xbox gamepad as a PC controller is significantly easier than a PlayStation one - it's all Microsoft after all.

However, a wireless connection can be achieved by holding down the main Xbox button and then the pair button while in your PC's Bluetooth settings. You'll see Xbox Wireless Controller appear as an option.\nWhat game controller is best for PC?\nThe best PC controller overall in our opinion is the Victrix Pro BFG as its modular build means you can change it to suit whatever game you want to excel in. It's available for PS5 as well as Xbox, although the Xbox version might be better if you aren't looking for a multiplatform device. It's competitively priced for such a solid gamepad these days, and the number of attachments and accessories you get for your money is unmatched.\nIs the PS5 controller good for PC?\nThe DualSense is definitely one of the stronger controller options on the market thanks to its adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. However, it doesn't have programmable back buttons or much of the software that separates the men from the boys in the best PC controller market. Having said that, with PlayStation now starting to release more of its first-party games on PC, the PS5 controller is probably one of the best ways to experience them. Although we'd recommend the DualSense Edge if your budget can stretch to it.\nDo PC gamers use controller?\nOverall, whether you want to use a PC controller or keyboard and mouse is entirely up to you and what you find comfortable. Some people prefer controller when they migrate to PC due to the familiarity. However, there are benefits to using keyboard and mouse, one being higher accuracy when aiming which can allow for a competitive advantage. There are also hybrids of the two like the Azeron keypads.\nRegardless; our advice would be to play with whatever you individually feel comfortable using. And perhaps most importantly, don't judge or mock others for what they choose. You never know why someone might need to use a controller over a mouse and keyboard - it could be for accessibility reasons. Either way, the toxicity around the controller vs mouse+keyboard debate isn't a healthy thing we should be keeping around in 2023.\nHow we test PC controllers\nTesting controllers actually starts before we play any games with it. Unboxing can be hugely telling because it's during this we learn about how much you get for your money, as well as the ergonomics of the controller. Early comfort tests are big because once you get a gamepad in your hands you can start to see who it's for and where its strengths will lie.\nThen, it's testing time in some actual games. The big thing here is to test across a range of genres so we know what the controller is good at and not so good at. For how precise a controller can be, we'll play some Celeste. For FPS feel and accuracy, I'll test with Hunt: Showdown. These are both games I know very well, so testing every controller with them gives me the chance to focus on how the gamepad is helping or hurting my performance.\nBeyond those two games in particular, we'll find a driving game, fighting game, and third-person action/adventure title to get a sense of some versatility.\nThere are always more general features to test too. Battery life, back buttons, the utility of customization software that comes with each controller, the deadzones of the thumbsticks out of the box, and their ability to change. We'll try to test for a few weeks at least to get a sense of a controller's longevity too, since durability is important when it comes to value.\nFor more on how we test controllers at GamesRadar+ check out our full article, and for something more representative of our holistic approach to the latest gear, check out our Hardware Policy.\nLooking for more ways to enhance your gaming setup? Definitely check out your control alternatives with the the best gaming keyboards and best gaming mouse candidates. And maybe it's time to upgrade to one of the best gaming desks or best gaming chairs. If your PC is getting on a bit, take a look at our guides on the best gaming laptops and best gaming PC.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension."

These are the best Xbox Series X controllers\nThe best Xbox Series X controllers are the keys to the gaming kingdom right now, since everything with a Wi-Fi connection is supposedly an Xbox. No matter which Xbox console or device you're playing on, most Xbox controllers will be compatible, and if you're playing on a PC, you've got so much choice as to which suits you best. Whether you're looking for a spare gamepad or the latest and greatest pro model, we've tested the lot, and we're ready to help you shop.\nThanks to Microsoft being, well, Microsoft, any and all Xbox controllers will also be best PC controller contenders. That means there are loads upon loads of gamepads available for you to choose from and a lot for me to test. Alongside the Victrix Pro BFG for Xbox, which is currently my top pick overall, there are some serious rivals to consider. PowerA, Turtle Beach, Razer, and GameSir are just a few of the brands out there constantly trying to earn the top spot on this list. In fact, a couple of the more recent attempts have come very close to doing so. Of course, the investment may decide things for you. Controllers don't come cheap these days, so you want to make sure whichever one you buy is the right one for you.\nTo help narrow things down, I've tried to apply \"best for\" use cases to each of the entries on this list. For example, if you're simply in need of a quick and easy replacement for the stock Xbox controller that came with your console, then \"best budget\" will see you through. If you're looking for more speed in your button presses, there's a \"best for speed\" alternative. Hopefully, this will make your search a bit easier and save you money on something you don't actually need.\nAs a long-term lover of pro controllers, I take great joy in keeping up with the world of Xbox gamepads. There's such a massive selection of great controllers for PC and Xbox that work just as well on either platform and as an enthusiast, I love testing the latest models out. That said, pro controllers aren't for everyone, so I'm determined to find you the perfect gaming tool for you and the games you play.\nThe Quick List\nBest overall\nWith excellent customization options and a solid price point, the Victrix Pro BFG is the best gamepad out there for competitive players.\nBest for most\nWith some of the best back paddles ever put on a gamepad, and excellent customization options with the console, this is as good as it gets.\nBest budget\nWe'd recommend this over a straight replacement Core controller because it has some exceptional features and real comfort for a budget price.\nBest value\nThe $150 Fusion Pro from PowerA gets you a lot of the benefits of the most expensive pro controllers on this list for around $50 less, making it a top-pick.\nThe best for speed\nThe latest model of the Wolverine sports mechanical buttons found in Razer's gaming mice, meaning it's capable of some breathtaking speed when you're in a game.\nThe most premium\nNacon's latest Xbox controller has amazing face buttons and cooling rubberized grips that make it feel worth every penny of its price tag. It's also extremely feature-rich.\nLoad the next 2 products \u2193\nBest for game feel\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra is great at a lot of things, but its feedback and rumble are surprisingly accurate for a controller without haptic feedback support.\nBest basic\nIts ergonomics and classic offset feel mean that for the majority of players on Xbox Series X or S, this is all the controller you'll really need.\nBest for color choices\nWhile being one of the best pro controllers on the market for Xbox Series X, the Scuf Instinct Pro has the best range of colors and aesthetics to choose from.\nBest for driving\nThe broad shoulders and robust feel of this gamepad make it the best way to enjoy driving sims... that is, without forking out for a bespoke wheel and pedal setup.\nJuly 31, 2025: After the arrival of the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited in last month's edition of this guide, I've been hard at work reviewing yet another challenger for the Xbox Series X controller power rankings. The GameSir G7 Pro is an incredible new addition to this market, and it screams value for money with its TMR thumbsticks, additional shoulder buttons, and two back buttons. That said, I haven't added it to this list yet because it's not readily available. It's only just launched, and that means it's not stocked at Amazon right now, but surely will be soon. For now, you can read a little more about it under the entry for the GameSir G7 SE, and read my full thoughts in my review.\nThe best Xbox Series X controller overall\n1. Victrix Pro BFG for Xbox\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOur favorite PS5 controller has made its way to Xbox, and its refreshed model for Microsoft's console might even be an improvement. In our eyes, this is one of the best gamepads ever made, so to say it's been improved on is a big deal. For competitive players, there is simply no better controller to choose right now. No matter the genre of game you play, the modular design of this controller means you can bend it to your will.\n\u2705 You want something for competitive gaming: Four back buttons and a modular design makes this a super versatile performance pad for all sorts of gaming genres.\n\u2705 Your budget is under $200 / \u00a3200: For $179.99 / \u00a3179.99, this is excellent value for money against the other officially licensed competition for Xbox.\n\u2705 You want a wireless controller: The Victrix Pro BFG for Xbox was one of the first officially licensed gamepads to launch with wireless support on Xbox, after years of Microsoft stipulating they had to be wired-only.\n\u274c You want Hall sensor thumbsticks out of the box: This controller sports potentiometer sticks, but there is the option to buy Hall modules later.\n\u274c You aren't interested in back buttons: The four back buttons on this controller are hard to ignore, so if you want something you won't accidentally press, maybe look elsewhere.\nDesign & Features: But what does that mean in practical terms? The facial components here can be lifted out and rotated, meaning you can finally have symmetrical thumbsticks on Xbox. You can also swap out the components entirely which is massive for fighting game fans - especially since there's a dedicated fightpad module in the box with six facial buttons.\nThis new Xbox version comes with all the same add-ons PS5 owners get, as well as integrated rumble motors and improved battery life. You don't get Hall sensor tech out of the box here, but if it ever becomes an issue for you, a Hall sensor thumbstick module is available for purchase, for an additional fee.\nPerformance: What you have here then, is a competitive Esports controller that now excels in competitive games as it did before, but has even more single-player potential thanks to its additional rumbly feedback. Combine that with the back buttons and it's an easy one to recommend to any player. It was also one of the first officially licensed Xbox controllers to get the wireless support he had been waiting on for years.\nCompared to some of its rivals, the BFG for Xbox is priced really competitively too. It often works out about the same price as the Elite Series 2 when its at full price, and I've seen the BFG get discounted down to $150, making it an absolute steal. For under $200, you get so much value for money and a lot of versatility. It's that ability to change this gamepad to your liking that makes it the best overall pick on this list.\nRead more: Victrix Pro BFG for Xbox review\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best Xbox Series X controller for most players\n2. Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTo the surprise of absolutely no one, the Elite Series 2 is one of the best Xbox Series X controllers, even as it ages against the officially licensed competition on this list. It really is still the one to beat for most Xbox (and PC) users who like the traditional feel of this brand's controllers. Even despite its age, this controller is well worth buying, and with no word about an Elite Series 3 coming any time soon, there's no reason to hold off.\n\u2705 You want a first-party controller: If you want Microsoft's homemade pro controller, this is the one to go for.\n\u2705 You don't mind something older: If you can put up with something a few years older than other options on this list, you might also save some money.\n\u2705 You want four magnetic back paddles: Magnetic back paddles are hard to beat for their speed and feel, and they're pretty uncommon on other controllers.\n\u274c You want Hall sensor thumbsticks: Stick drift could be a problem you run into, and there's no real counter.\n\u274c You don't need the attachments: If you aren't interested in the various attachments of the Elite Series 2, you could get the same great controller for cheaper by opting for the Core edition.\nDesign & Features: The one upside to the Elite Series 2 getting older is that it's much more prone to deals and discounts, and the more affordable Elite Series 2 Core is a nice route in if you aren't too fussed about the attachments.\nFiring on all cylinders though, the full-fat Elite Series 2 is a force to be reckoned with. With four magnetic back paddles, there are few gamepads that can match the feel and comfort of this controller. The component pack also gives you some different thumbstick tops, and the tight tension on the potentiometer modules gives the controller a really speedy feel.\nPerformance: Besides the excellent versatility and comfort of this controller, the extended 40-hour battery life is one of the things that really sets it apart from others on the market. Some third-party controllers don't even have wireless support on Xbox, and if they do their battery lives don't tend to be this generous.\nWhere the Elite Series 2 does show its age slightly is in its potentiometer thumbsticks which have been reported to suffer from stick drift after a while. There's no ability to have Hall sensor tech here, which is worth considering if you want a long-term investment.\nRead more: Xbox Elite 2 controller review\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAlso consider: The Elite Series 2 Core\nIf the Elite Series 2 is a bit much for you in terms of budget and accessories, the Elite Series 2 Core gives you the same gamepad, battery life, and software adjustability, all at a lower price. It's well worth considering, and since you can add the components later to split up the cost it can be a more affordable route in.\nThe best budget Xbox Series X controller\n3. GameSir G7 SE\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nEditor's note: The GameSir G7 Pro is here!\nGreetings, Xbox controller fans! This month, I had the pleasure of reviewing the GameSir G7 Pro, which is an updated model of this controller with more features and a slightly higher price tag. It's still early days, so I can't see it listed at Amazon, or anywhere, for that matter. For that reason, I've held off from adding it to this guide this month, but it'll likely steal the best value award when it's more available to buy next month. For now, I just want to let you know about it so that if your budget can stretch a little further, you know that holding off to wait for this to hit the shelves is the better play.\nRead more: GameSir G7 Pro review\nThe GameSir G7 SE was the first officially licensed controller for Xbox Series X to include Hall Effect Sensor thumbsticks. For those who might not know, these types of thumbsticks use tiny electromagnets and last far longer than the potentiometers you'll find in controllers up and down this list. Essentially, it means it's immune to stick drift. Considering this pad is on par, if not cheaper than the stock Xbox controller, you're getting so much value for money here.\n\u2705 You want something cheap: A price tag of under $60 for a pro controller is a rare thing, especially in the officially licensed accessory world.\n\u2705 You like a traditional Xbox feel: It's on the smaller side, but the shape and ergonomics of this gamepad are close to the traditional Xbox ones.\n\u2705 You're looking for a spare, or something to replace your original controller: Since the G7 SE is about the same price as the stock Xbox controller, I'd argue this is a much better replacement since it gives you loads more features.\n\u274c You want wireless support: Perhaps the biggest drawback to this controller is that it has no wireless connectivity.\n\u274c You want something a bit bigger: The GameSir Kaleid, Kaleid Flux, and upcoming G7 Pro are probably better for those with larger hands.\nDesign & Features: Annoyingly, since it's a third-party controller made before 2024, there's no wireless support to be had here, and there are some pretty unruly thumbstick dead zones out of the box. Luckily you can play around with this by heading to GameSir's Nexus software on PC. There you can also play around with button assignments, vibration, and more. Speaking of vibration, it feels really subtle and precise with the G7 SE.\nYou get two back buttons here, which is the standard for any GameSir controller. Besides that, it has a smaller shape to it that feels authentic to the official Core controller that comes with your console.\nPerformance: An alternate accolade for the GameSir G7 SE could have been the best Xbox Series X controller for platforming because that's where I found it came into its own. Its two back buttons feel incredible - as is the norm with GameSir controllers, but the compact and tactile feel of the G7 SE means it feels great to use in sidescrolling or top-down titles.\nFor its budget price tag, the G7 SE offers a lot of value as well, because you're getting an awful lot of pro controller features for the price of a stock one. No matter what award you want to give this, the Game Sir G7 SE is one of the best Xbox Series X controllers - and one you should definitely consider buying over the regular Core controller that comes with your console.\nRead more: GameSir G7 SE review\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | NA |\nAdd-ons | NA |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best value Xbox Series X Controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhere do I even begin with the PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless? If it weren't for the Victrix Pro BFG's slight edge in versatility, this may even steal the top spot on this list. It offers a four back buttons package with innovative design elements and loads of features, and it's only $150 - which is roughly $50 cheaper than other pads that offer this much utility. Oh yeah, and it has a stunning ghost RGB design that looks incredible.\n\u2705 You want excellent value for money: It's not cheap at $149, but the value you get from this controller punches well into the $200 category.\n\u2705 You want four back buttons: Not all controllers of this price come with four back buttons, and the ones on this controller are excellent.\n\u2705 You like RGB: The lighting on this controller is in a league of its own, just take a look at it.\n\u274c You really aren't a fan of RGB: The ghost lighting here could make a believer out of anyone, but if you really hate RGB of any kind then look elsewhere.\n\u274c You want a modular design: While you can change aspects of this controller to suit you, it isn't the fully modular controller the BFG is.\nDesign & Features: If you've played around with PowerA's controllers before, you'll know that they pack some of the most robust build quality of any gamepads you can find. The shape and feel are very reminiscent of the traditional Xbox controller, but the amount PowerA does to jazz up that formula is so impressive.\nThere are Hall sensor thumbsticks, wireless support, a charging stand, four mappable back buttons, a massive 30-hour battery life, three-way trigger locks, a headset dial, up to three different profiles, and a carry case. Perhaps my favorite feature is its twisting thumbsticks which can grow and shrink to different heights without the need for swapping out parts.\nSuch excellent design is coupled with a ghost RGB which shines when you want it to, and goes completely unseen when the controller is switched off. It's like the swords of Middle Earth that glow blue when orcs are near, except it's a beautiful RGB pattern on a pro controller.\nPerformance: As you can imagine, the PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless performed really well in our review, earning it a five-star score. No matter the game you turn it to, it'll be comfortable, and useful, and it'll look and feel great at the same time. The trigger locks don't bring down the actuation level to the level most others do, but this is a double-edged sword. In some ways, it makes them a bit useless, and in others, it keeps some of the feel of a trigger pull while adding some speed. Overall, this is a fantastic controller for the money.\nRead more: PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless review\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best Xbox Series X controller for speed\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is by far and away the best controller this brand has ever produced. It evolves what was great about the former Wolverine models, prices it down from the PS5 version, and improves so much about the ergonomics and feel. Thanks to the utilization of mechanical buttons from Razer's gaming mice, this is capable of playing at extraordinary speeds.\n\u2705 You want a competitive controller: Six extra back buttons and innovative design flourishes make this a serious mouse and keyboard rival.\n\u2705 You like microswitches: This is packed with microswitch buttons, so if you aren't a fan of clicky buttons, maybe consider something else.\n\u2705 You want something built to last: Between Hall sensor thumbsticks and a robust chassis, this is a controller that'll last you years into the future.\n\u274c You're on a budget: Razer controllers are always pricey, so if you can't afford the $200 price of this pad, look at something else.\n\u274c You want some RGB: This controller has more of a pro aesthetic to it, so if you'd rather have a flashy RGB controller, there are other options out there.\nDesign & Features: The traditional Wolverine build is still here, with chunky, rounded grips and broad shoulders. Four back buttons remain, although their placement now actually makes sense because they're integrated into where your fingers naturally grip the thing. You'll also get two additional bumpers, which adds a lot of versatility and potential for mapping. This is also the first Razer controller to feature wireless support on Xbox, as well as a carry case and some swappable thumbstick tops. The V3 is capable of a 1,000Hz polling rate when using a wired connection on PC as well, so there's lots of Esports potential here.\nPerformance: In practice, this is a much better controller than the Wolverine V2 Pro for PS5, and that's partly due to a much more robust build quality compared to the Sony-licensed hollow model. Wireless support on Xbox or PC is going to be a big win for people too, although be wary of anything that may block the signal because more than with any other controller I've tested recently, the V3 Pro can suffer in that respect.\nStill, the unparalleled speed and feel of the microswitch and membrane buttons here really does make a difference. There are few pads that can keep up with the pace of this controller, so if you find yourself constantly a step behind your opponents, this is the product to choose. Even at an adjusted price from the PS5 option, it is still undeniably expensive at $200.\nRead more: Razer Wolverine V3 Pro review\nAlso consider: Razer Wolverine V3 TE\nIf you want all the features and design perks of the V3 Pro but you don't care about wireless connectivity and don't have the budget, consider the Tournament Edition. It comes in a bit cheaper, and besides the attachments and rubber grips, you're really not missing all that much.\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe most premium Xbox Series X controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSome of the more recent Xbox Series X controllers can cost a pretty penny (around $200). While you do pay for quality when it comes to most of them, you can still wonder why on earth these pads cost so much. The Nacon Revolution X Unlimited is one of the few that makes every button press, stick flick, and long session using it feel like they're worth every penny you've spent on it. Its long list of features goes a long way as well.\n\u2705You want to avoid stick drift: The RXU comes with Hall Effect thumbsticks and triggers so that you don't need to buy a replacement due to stick drift.\n\u2705You want a premium feel: The cooling rubberized grips of this controller and the unique face buttons make it feel like so much more than just a gaming accessory.\n\u2705You want lots of extra buttons: With four great back buttons and two extra bumpers, you've got loads of functionality at your fingertips.\n\u274cYou don't like loose stick tension: The thumbsticks of the Revolution X Unlimited have quite a loose tension, which means they can be harder to pin down into precise places when aiming.\n\u274cYou want a modular build: While there are plenty of attachments, this isn't the fully modular controller the BFG is.\n\u274cYou don't need six extra buttons: If you won't make use of the extensive features at play here, you'll be better off saving money and getting something cheaper.\nDesign & Features: Where other controllers in the market are downsizing their face buttons, Nacon still isn't afraid to make its design strokes big and bold. Front and central on the RXU is the new touchpad, which early adopters of the PS5 version of this controller missed out on. This is a somewhat useful way to interact with the controller's settings, but a lot of the big adjustments need to be made through Nacon's controller App on Windows, which makes this signature feature feel a bit like a gimmick.\nLuckily, the rest of the controller feels worth the time and effort Nacon has put into reworking it after the launch of the PS5 model. The face buttons feel newly refreshed, touting a beautifully clean and clicky actuation. The back buttons feel refined and are so easy to press, and the addition of two extra bumpers adds so much versatility. Rubberized grips help the controller feel cool in your hands, no matter how intense gameplay is getting. For your money, you also get small adjusting weights, a carry case, charging stand, cable, and a few attachments.\nPerformance: This is a really strong all-rounder of a controller. Its excellent features make it a brilliant pad to use in competitive multiplayer games, while its premium feel gives it so much singleplayer potential. I just wish the thumbsticks could have a tighter tension. There are few that dare to go loose, which I suppose helps the RXU to stand apart from its peers. Still, it undermines what is otherwise an excellent controller for FPS games.\nThe best Xbox Series X controller for game feel\n7. Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra Wireless controller is everything the Asus ROG Raikiri Pro from 2023 should have been. It has a small display on its face, and unlike the Asus pads, it's actually useful. More importantly, the Stealth Ultra Wireless is the first ever officially licensed third-party Xbox Series X controller to feature wireless connectivity with the console. That's a landmark achievement for any controller on this list and one that makes it our favorite third-party controller overall.\n\u2705 You want great game feel: Haptic feedback and rumble can add a lot to your games, and this controller is set up to help you.\n\u2705 You'd like a screen to help you navigate settings: Function buttons can be really annoying, and the screen on this controller helps you change settings easily\n\u2705 You want four back buttons: They're placed horizontally, which doesn't always work out, but the back buttons here pull it off thanks to their clicky feel.\n\u274c You don't care about wireless support: If you're only ever going to play in wired mode, there's not much point in spending extra money on something like this.\n\u274c You use your D-pad a lot: The D-pad here works just fine, but its metallic panel isn't the best for accurate, intense platforming.\nDesign & Features: The design of this gamepad is no short of stunning. It's got some lovely RGB lines striking through its grips and face, that aforementioned display for customization, and some truly innovative back buttons. Its buttons are microswitch ones, its triggers, and thumbsticks have Hall Sensor tech inside them, and its vibration is punchy without being overbearing.\nYou get the usual connectivity here; a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C charging, but with your purchase you get a USB dongle and a small magnetic charging stand too. While you might not get the kind of assortments and attachments as some more Esports-specific controllers do, you do get some thumbstick toppers for your money, and these go a long way to correct the sub-par, slippy designs of the regular sticks.\nPerformance: What I love about this controller is that it does everything well. It isn't quite as good performance-wise as something from Victrix, but it isn't far off. Short of that, you'd be hard-pressed to find a gaming genre this controller isn't perfect for. What's more, its 30-hour quoted battery life is accurate, and thanks to the charging stand, I never have to worry about it running out of charge. It feels like the classic Xbox controllers people love, but it's got that Turtle Beach twist you'll know from a React-R gamepad which only adds to the experience of the games you play.\nOverall, this is one of the best controllers for Xbox Series X that you'll find.\nRead more: Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra review\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best basic Xbox Series X controller\n8. Xbox Wireless Controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe stock Xbox Series X controller has a massive range of colors and designs to choose from, not to mention some beautiful limited editions as well. Beyond aesthetics, it has a cult following for its ergonomics and classic offset feel in the hands. For the majority of players on Xbox Series X or S, this is all you'll really need. Just keep in mind there are better options out there functionality-wise.\n\u2705 You don't need pro features: If you only need a basic controller and want the traditional Xbox feel, look no further.\n\u2705 You want color options: The Xbox controller comes in lots of unique colors and designs.\n\u2705 Back buttons aren't your thing: There's no problem with using a regular controller. They've done the job until now, right?\n\u274c You want a bit more bang for your buck: You can get a pro controller for the same price, if not cheaper than this today, so don't limit yourself.\n\u274c You want stick drift immunity: There's no block to stick drift with this controller, which is worth thinking about if you're going to spend the money.\nDesign & Features: This time around we have USB-C charging which is faster than Micro-USB (if you use a rechargeable pack at least) and there's a 'hybrid' D-pad that takes its cues from a more premium Xbox controller that we'll mention later. Like with many other players, we have found the big inclusion to be the share button which was missing all of the last generation (while the DualShock 4 had it from the start) - which does exactly what it should, enabling you to take snaps or clips and share media easily.\nPerformance: Predictably, we've found it to work smoothly and beautifully via cable or the usual pairing mode, and it's got that excellent performance and comfort by default. It will be very familiar to Xbox One owners from the last generation but there are subtle tweaks that do make it an objectively better controller.\nHowever, there's an overwhelming reason why this iteration is easy for us to recommend and why it is similar to the previous generation's - if it isn't broken, you don't fix it. This is a traditional Xbox controller, and that's all a lot of people ever need. It's comfortable, allows for speedy performance in the right hands, and does the basics well.\nJust keep in mind that you don't get much value for your money as a result. There are other pro controller out there today under $60 that give you a whole host of features, more practical wireless support, and work with Xbox. Moreover, if you've been burned by stick drift before, Hall sensor options might be more appealing.\nRead more: Our impressions of the Xbox Series X controller\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nAdd-ons | NA |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best pro controller for color preferences\n9. Scuf Instinct Pro\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt's fair enough to be skeptical of the design-it-yourself Scuf Instinct. For starters, it's expensive. Incredibly expensive. But if you can move past that, you'll find a genuinely excellent Xbox Series X controller with the best back buttons we've ever used. These things are a revelation.\n\u2705 You want to customize the colors of your gamepad: Scuf's online builder is amazing for being able to change every aspect of its gamepad aesthetics to suit you.\n\u2705 You can afford it: There's no escaping the fact this is a pricey controller. Only consider if you have the budget for it.\n\u2705 You play FPS games: Scuf designs its pads around competitive first-person shooters like Call of Duty, and they're popular in those games for a reason.\n\u274c You don't care about looks: If you want the best controller you can afford, and don't worry too much about its looks, then you can probably get better value somewhere else on this list.\n\u274c You're on a budget: There are plenty of cheaper alternatives out there.\nDesign & Features: Sure, you can mix and match designs ranging from simple color swaps to golden Japanese Koi art. It also has a satisfyingly ergonomic rubber coating at the front for better grip. Oh, and you can change the shape of the thumbsticks before checkout as well.\nThe trigger locks are right on the money as well. They enable much faster responses than you'd find from the console's standard controller; we're definitely not that quick on the draw in Halo the rest of the time. Even the thumbsticks feel bouncier and more taut than usual.\nPerformance: So, is the result worth the money? Should you buy one instead of the Elite Series 2? It's a subjective matter best left in your capable hands, but if you do decide to invest, you'll find a handset at the top of its game.\nThe savvy back button placement makes them so easy to activate in the middle of a Destiny firefight or Call of Duty battle. Because they form a shell of sorts around your index finger, all you need to do is press down or lift up to activate them. It's much more intuitive than other alternatives we've tried - and we've tried more than our fair share.\nBeing able to customize the look of a controller can make it feel individual to you, but it doesn't mean you're getting the best controller out there. If you can stomach the price and colorways are important to you, this is the one to consider.\nRead more: Scuf Instinct Pro review\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | NA |\nAdd-ons | \u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nThe best Xbox controller for driving games\n10. Thrustmaster eSwap X 2\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Thrustmaster eSwap X 2 is the latest version of Thrustmaster's modular pro controller. This version brings the family into the modern era with USB-C but doesn't do much to change the formula besides. This is a broad, robust, and comfortable controller to use for longer sessions, but not one we'd recommend for most multiplayer games.\n\u2705 You play a lot of driving games: This is clearly a controller that's been designed for driving experiences with excellent triggers and easy modular swapping.\n\u2705 You have larger hands: This is a larger controller, and it definitely suits someone who wants more room to play with.\n\u2705 Comfort is king: Besides the back buttons, this is a super comfortable controller to use in longer sessions.\n\u274c You play a lot of FPS games: While the sticks and triggers are decent, the back buttons really let down the performance of this controller in competitive FPS games.\n\u274c You don't care about swapping out facial components: You can find comfortable controllers without overspending on a modular design.\nDesign & Features: You can get a lot of utility out of what Thrustmaster has designed here, and if you're familiar with previous versions of the eSwap range, you'll know what to expect. The toolless modular design lets you tug facial components out, snap others in, and enjoy your controller as you see fit. That's even easier than Victrix makes it, which deserves praise. We'd recommend checking out additional facial modules to really upgrade this controller, especially the funky racing wheel module from the Thrustmaster eSwap XR.\nIn general, this is a controller that really suits a pair of larger hands thanks to its broad shoulders and longer grips. Its facial buttons have a smaller actuation that can be good for speed, but don't add much in the way of feel.\nPerformance: Where the eSwap X 2 really stands out is in driving games, and third-person action adventures. Particularly in the former, the triggers lend themselves to a light touch and the thumbsticks have a looser tension that helps with precise cornering. The angular shoulder buttons are a stand-out in third-person games and are another ergonomic plus with this gamepad that sits well in larger hands.\nFor all the ergonomic points this gets right, the tiny back buttons really should have evolved this time around. With so many iterations of this controller across Xbox and PS4, you'd think that one of the biggest points of frustration would have been remedied with this version. It really is a shame, because better back buttons would elevate this as a gamepad to use in a wider range of genres.\nRead more: Thrustmaster eSwap X 2 review\nComfort | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nErgonomics | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPro features | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nLongevity | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | NA |\nAdd-ons | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nMultiplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nSingleplayer potential | \u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBest Xbox Series X controller: FAQs\nWhat is the best Xbox Series X controller for FPS?\nIn our eyes, the best Xbox Series X controllers for competitive multiplayer shooters are ones with four back buttons (or more). This is because they allow you to assign more in-game functions to other digits, freeing up your thumbs to keep you moving and looking. The Official Elite Series 2 is a fantastic choice for these sorts of games since you can also set custom deadzones. The Scuf Instinct Pro and Razer Wolverine V2 are also solid third party choices.\nWhat is the best third party alternative to the Xbox Elite 2?\nWe'd argue that the best Xbox Series X controller overall is the Elite Series 2 - there simply isn't a better all-round alternative. However for competitive players, Scuf's controllers are an excellent go-to. We list the Scuf Instinct Pro as the best Xbox Series X controller for eSports thanks to its superb back buttons and great overall build quality. You also have the added benefit of customizing the design for yourself.\nIs the Xbox Series X controller different to Xbox One?\nThe Xbox Series X Core controller does differ from the original model released with the previous generation console. The most noticeable change is the redesigned D-Pad, offering a concave approach to ensure diagonal inputs are a lot smoother. The Xbox Series X controller also makes use of a low latency connection with Series X consoles and adds a Share button to the face. The newer gamepad also charges via USB-C, carries a slightly smaller form factor, and replaces the shiny plastic covering of the Xbox One model with a matte finish.\nWhat is the Xbox Series X controller compatible with?\nThe official Xbox Series X controller is compatible with the new generation of consoles, the Xbox Series S, all Xbox One models, PC, Android, and iOS. If you use GamePass via your Smart TV, the Xbox Series X controller may also be compatible with that too, but check the specific TV models to be sure.\nWhat is the best Xbox controller in the world?\nThe best Xbox Series X controller overall is the Microsoft Elite Series 2, but we'd recommend the majority of players check out the Xbox Wireless controller. It works smoothly and has all the features any casual gamers would need. The most affordable Xbox Series X controller, however, has to be the Turtle Beach React-R. It presents features which are typically only present in much more expensive controllers.\nHow we test Xbox Series X controllers\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nIn brief, every controller that we have had our hands on is used in a series of different video games to accommodate for most genres. This means that we'll test the responsiveness of the sticks, face buttons, bumpers, triggers, and any other additional features found on the unit. If a controller is wired or relies on rechargeable batteries, then the duration of the lifespan is tested, too. The same can be said for any specialist software, such as drivers, that may be included with the gamepad as well.\nFor more on how we test controllers at GamesRadar+ check out our full article, and for something more representative of our holistic approach to the latest gear, check out our Hardware Policy.\nWe're also rounding up plenty more Xbox Series X accessories (and all the best Xbox One accessories if you're after something a little cheaper), like the best Xbox steering wheels and the best Xbox Series X hard drives.\n\u2705You want something that'll last: This controller has Hall effect thumbstick,s meaning it won't suffer from stick drift.\n\u2705You want a premium feel: I don't think there are any controllers that feel more worth their high price tags than Nacon's Revolution X Unlimited.\n\u2705You want something that's adjustable: This controller comes with a carrying case, adjustable weights, and a few more accessories.\n\u274cYou don't like loose stick tension: The thumbsticks of the Revolution X Unlimited might be immune to stick drift, but their tension is on the looser side.\n\u274cYou're already looking for TMR thumbstick tech: There's an even newer type of thumbstick tech that's more advanced, and a few TMR options are on this list already.\n\u274cYou don't need six extra buttons: If you want Hall thumbsticks but you're on a budget, there are loads of options from other brands.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.\n- Rob Dwiar\n- Tabitha BakerManaging Editor - Hardware"

      "text": "The best Nintendo Switch controllers in 2025\nWe're rounding up all the best buttons to complement your console, and testing which ones work with the brand new Switch 2\nThe best Nintendo Switch controllers seem like they'll work as Nintendo Switch 2 controllers, but now that the console is out, we'll be testing that out. We're still yet to hear official confirmation about third-party controllers working on Switch 2 and try it for ourselves, but we do now know that the original Switch pro controller will be compatible with the new platform, and the original Joy-Cons can be connected wirelessly to it. Since the new dock has USB outlets of its own, I don't see any reason that third-party gamepads won't work either, but again, we need to confirm that.\nThankfully, the gamepads on the list below are still worth buying even if compatibility is an issue, because a lot of them can be counted among the best PC controllers, too. If you aren't planning on upgrading to the new Switch 2, investing in a new controller is one of the best ways to make an aging gaming platform feel just like new. Given the durability problems with a lot of the Switch's first-party controllers, a new controller will also help to futureproof it, and you might be glad to know there are loads of anti-stick drift options available. The Nintendo Switch 2 has now launched, and it brings with it a new Pro Controller with back buttons.\nThe good news? Cheaper options are rife in original Switch land. It's more than possible to get a decent gamepad or handheld mode controller for under $100. If you're thinking of grabbing a Switch 2 now that it's available, we'd maybe be more hesitant about grabbing a new controller now, since it's unconfirmed that accessories will carry compatibility over. We've only just gotten to go hands-on with the new console ourselves, so please bear with us as we find out more.\nThe Quick List\nBest overall\nThe original Nintendo Switch controller is up there with the best simple gamepads ever made. Its battery life is legendary, and for most players, it's ideal.\nBest Joy-Con alternative\nIf you want a replacement for the Joy-Con controllers that came with your console, Hori's Split Pad Pro is a much better alternative in our eyes.\nMost comfortable\nIf you play in handheld a lot, the Nitro Deck+ will ensure you have all the functionality you need, and none of the annoying thumb cramps you get from offset sticks.\nBest pro controller\nThe GameSir Tarantula Pro is one of the best controllers on any platform right now, and its futureproofed thumbsticks and reasonable price make it worth knowing about.\nMost versatile\nPlain and simple, the controllers you get with the console are the most versatile option available. Just be wary of that pesky stick drift these are known for.\nShow more \u2193\nBest racing wheel\nLooking for something that'll enhance your Mario Kart World gameplay? We haven't had confirmation it's compatible, but maybe keep your eye on Hori's solution.\nBest for handheld mode\nThe Switch's smaller size can make it difficult to use in handheld mode for longer periods of time. The Nitro Deck beefs it up, turning it into a modern-day handheld.\nI love how many ways there are to control games on the Nintendo Switch, and all of them feel intuitive. I'm lucky enough to test out the latest and greatest gamepads, Joy-Con alternatives, pro controllers, and more so that I can recommend you the best ones. With Switch 2 on its way, I'm already on the hunt for which controllers will carry over to the new system.\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is essential if you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time on the Switch. Not only does it help avoid the claw-hand you start to get after a long session using the Joy-Cons, it\u2019s just better suited to games like Super Smash Bros. or Splatoon. We also find that the thumbsticks are a little more precise than those seen on the Joy-Con, and are far less prone to drifting.\n\u2705 You play in docked mode often: This isn't going to make much sense if you tend to play in handheld mode only\n\u2705 You want great battery life: Even today, this controller has some of the best battery life of any wireless controller.\n\u2705 You want something more comfortable: If you find the shape of the Joy-Cons a little uncomfortable and small, this will suit you more.\n\u274c You want back buttons: Annoyingly, back buttons were kept in the tank for the Switch 2 Pro Controller.\n\u274c You plan to use Game Chat on Switch 2: There's no C button on this controller, so the Switch 2 Pro Controller makes a bit more sense to buy for the new console.\nDesign & Features: Yes, the Joy-Con are going to be best for handheld play, but chances are you've already got a set of those knocking about. If you're after the best Nintendo Switch controller for kicking back on the couch and playing games like you would on an at-home console, the original, official Pro controller is where it's at.\nYou're still getting the HD Rumble, motion sensors, and Amiibo functionality of the Joy-Cons in here, but a far more ergonomic design that feels much more comfortable in larger hands. The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller comes in a stock black, but there are one or two special editions floating around.\nPerformance: This is a traditional style gamepad, so you're only getting one controller for your cash, and compared to today's standards of what a pro controller is, it isn't going to stand up very tall. But a super comfortable feel and excellent battery life is a big win here that offsets the lack of back buttons and adjustability.\nRead more: Nintendo Switch Pro Controller review\nThe best Joy-Con alternative\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you don't want to shell out for a set of official Joy-Con Nintendo Switch controllers, the Hori Split Pad Pro offers not only a cheaper option but a far more comfortable one. The larger gamepads slot straight into the sides of your console like normal, but the chunkier form factor gives you a much more comfortable grip, full-sized thumbsticks, wider shoulder buttons, and assignable triggers.\n\u2705 You don't want to buy another set of Joy-Cons: If you've been burned by stick drift or don't like the comfort the official Switch controllers offer, this is the best alternative.\n\u2705 You have larger hands: If you want a bit more to grab onto when playing in handheld mode, this is a vast improvement over the Joy-Cons.\n\u2705 You want full-sized thumbsticks: Annoyingly, they aren't immune to stick drift, but bigger thumbsticks offer more accuracy.\n\u274c You want stick drift immunity: If you're looking for something that definitely won't succumb to stick drift, maybe look for another alternative.\n\u274c You're upgrading to Switch 2: The magnetic rails and different size of the Switch 2 will mean this isn't going to be an option for new-gen players.\nDesign & Features: We found that the extra heft these controllers give you compared to the Joy-Cons not only made for a far more comfortable experience overall, but also - combined with the extra precise thumbsticks and larger triggers - afforded us greater accuracy in games like Pokemon Legends Arceus, Fortnite, and Fuser as well.\nThe controllers are officially licensed by Nintendo, so work with the console straight out of the box and come in at just $49.99 / \u00a349.99. That's excellent value and a great alternative to the vanilla Joy-Con set that comes with the Nintendo Switch. There are also a range of special designs to choose from, tying into everything from Pac-Man to Pokemon.\nPerformance: It's important to note that these Nintendo Switch controllers can only be used when connected directly to the console via the rails in handheld mode, as neither of the two pads offers its own battery. That means they can't be split up to form two separate gamepads either. However, you can also pick up the Split Pad Pro with an accompanying attachment piece to slot in between them. That means you can take your handheld controllers and use them for wired docked play with additional volume and mic mute controls as well.\nRead more: Hori Split Pad Pro review\nAlso Consider: Hori D-Pad controller\nIf only one of your Joy-Con controllers is failing you and you don't want to buy a completely new set, you might be glad to know that a quick fix is available. The Hori D-Pad controller won't quite offer the same experience as an official Joy-Con, but if you're in a pinch or you're looking for that full D-pad experience, it's a sure win. The key here is that price point. While an official Joy-Con will set you back around $45 / \u00a340, Hori's left-hand alternative version retails at $27.99 / \u00a322.99 (and is regularly on sale for far less).\nThe most comfortable Switch controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Nitro Deck+ is an updated version of 2023's best Nintendo Switch accessory. With this refreshed design, CRKD has made the thumbsticks symmetrical, which provides a massive quality of life update for those players who get thumb cramps from playing in handheld mode for too long.\n\u2705 You play in handheld mode: Although you can use the Nitro Deck as a PC controller, we'd recommend it to Switch players who tend to use the console in handheld mode more.\n\u2705 You have larger hands: The Nitro Deck's larger grips and thumbsticks make it so much more comfortable.\n\u2705 You want maximum functionality: With four back buttons and two side bumpers there are so many mappable functions at play here.\n\u274c You never play in handheld mode: It goes without saying, but don't buy a handheld controller if you only play at home in docked mode.\n\u274c You're hoping it boosts the internal power of the console: As much as the Nitro Deck+ makes the Switch feel like a Steam Deck, it doesn't improve the internal power of the console.\nDesign & Features: Not only do we get an improved design, but sidekick buttons give extra utility to this controller, on top of the four back buttons that carry over from the original model. Further, this is a lovely accessory for anyone who wants to dock their switch while holding onto its handheld mode feel. The Nitro Deck+ works with any HDMI to USB-C converter, and lets you enjoy the controller you've invested in on the big screen.\nPerformance: I found that playing with the Nitro Deck+ was a lot more comfortable than playing with the regular model. For reference, I was a big fan of CRKD's first outing, and it still appears on this list for that reason. Luckily, the Nitro Deck+ isn't much more expensive, and still feels like a worthy investment for a console that's rapidly approaching the end of its tenure as Nintendo's flagship.\nOne of few let downs I had here were the cheap feeling plastics used on the back buttons. They were hardly a dealbreaker, but did stick out as the only thing that didn't feel premium. Then again, for such a reasonable price, you are getting anti-stick drift thumbsticks that are sure to last you.\nThe best pro controller for Nintendo Switch\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt can be tough to find pro controllers these days that sport symmetrical thumbsticks. It can also be tricky to find ones that feel like a successor to the PS4's DualShock 4, but the GameSir Tarantula Pro fits into both of those categories. This is one of the most comfortable, and most futureproofed controllers on the shelves right now, so it's well worth considering if you're looking for a pro controller to use in more competitive games, or if you need something that's also compatible with PC.\n\u2705 You play in docked mode: This is one of the best controllers on the shelves right now, so it suits those players who tend to use docked mode.\n\u2705 You prefer a PlayStation layout: Symmetrical thumbsticks can be hard to come by. This remedies that.\n\u2705 You want two back buttons: Two back buttons will be helpful in all sorts of games on Switch, and there are additional face buttons too.\n\u274c You prefer asymmetrical thumbsticks: It's always a lively debate, but if you prefer the Xbox thumbstick layour, this one isn't for you.\n\u274c You don't need back buttons: If you don't need the extra functionality you could spend less on something more basic.\nDesign & Features: The GameSir Tarantula Pro is extremely similar to the DualShock 4 in its design, and sparing some slightly increased girth in its grips, it's almost the exact same dimensions. It does replace the larger touchpad with a smaller, GameSir branded one, however, and frames it with some extra, remappable face buttons. These can be used for macro combinations or whatever other functions you'd like. There's some gentle RGB at play as well that you can customize, and its face buttons have glyphs inside them that swap between the Switch and PC layouts.\nPerformance: The most notable feature here is TMR thumbsticks which take the excellence and longevity of Hall Sensor tech and kick it up a gear. TMR means you have even more points on an axis that the thumbsticks can register, allowing for more accuracy and precise movements. All that, and there are no physical resistors, so they're just as immune to stick drift. Two back buttons are great here, as they always are with GameSir's controllers, but it's a shame there aren't two more, as they'd really be more useful than the extra face buttons.\nThis is an all-round classic of a controller that will help you perform better in any genre of game. It's also more comfortable than most pro controllers for longer sessions, and if you liked the PS4's controller, you'll feel right at home here.\nThe most versatile Switch controllers\n5. Nintendo Switch Joy-Con\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe classic Nintendo Switch Joy-Con are, of course, some of the best Nintendo Switch controllers knocking about. However, with their track record for drifting and, in our experience, less precise thumbsticks, there are better options on the market. Not many of those third-party alternatives will do everything the Joy-Con itself can, though.\n\u2705 You need a quick and easy replacement: Joy-Cons are known to be pretty fragile, so if you just need a simple replacement, this is staring you in the face.\n\u2705 You like to keep things official: I understand the desire to keep your console and accessories in the family. If you don't want a third-party alternative, go for some Joy-Cons.\n\u2705 You want some color options: Since launch, Nintendo has put out loads of new colorways.\n\u274c You prefer asymmetrical thumbsticks: It's always a lively debate, but if you prefer the Xbox thumbstick layour, this one isn't for you.\n\u274c You don't need back buttons: If you don't need the extra functionality you could spend less on something more basic.\nDesign & Features: While you'll find far greater comfort from something like the Hori Split Pad Pro, there aren't any other brands that can slot into your wireless / motion control playstyle this well. You're covered for all things Switch Sports and Ring Fit Adventure by sticking with something a little more traditional.\nPerformance: Joy-Con are the best Nintendo Switch controllers for those looking to keep things official while still expressing themselves through a range of different color combinations. Of course, you're getting all the flagship features of the console in here, with HD Rumble and Amiibo support, as well as motion controls. If you're playing docked, you can attach each individual Joy-Con to a grip for a more traditional feel as well. If you've spent a little less on the Nintendo Switch Lite price, these are well worth investing in as they open you up to a whole world of local multiplayer and can easily slot into a Nintendo Switch case as well.\nAlthough you can buy individual Joy-Cons, we wouldn't recommend it - it's more cost-effective to get a pair. More specifically, single packs go for around $49.99 / \u00a339.99, while a pair usually starts at $79.99 / \u00a369.99.\nThe best racing wheel for Nintendo Switch\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nHori's Mario Kart racing wheel's bright red plastic and looming M logo in the center immediately indicate what it should be used for. For years the argument has loomed large: what is the best controller to play Mario Kart? This might just put all those disputes to bed.\n\u2705 You play a lot of Mario Kart: It goes without saying, but maybe don't buy this if you aren't mainlining Mario Kart.\n\u2705 You want a racing wheel for PC: Racing setups are expensive, so if you're thinking of investing in one for PC, maybe make it this one so you can kill two birds with one stone.\n\u2705 You take Mario Kart seriously: If you're serious about your competitive level in Mario Kart, a wheel might be a good way to squeeze another few miliseconds out of your laptimes.\n\u274c You mainly play FPS games: As fun as Mario Kart is, if you don't play it a lot, you're not really going to get your money's worth here.\n\u274c You're on a budget: Cheaper Nintendo Switch controllers exist.\nDesign & Features: No, it's not going to steal any aesthetic awards from the likes of more enthusiast-level racing wheels for PC but it's certainly a design that appeals to its fun-loving Ninty audience. Don't let that light-hearted exterior fool you, though, this is a well-built piece of kit.\nDespite its $100/\u00a3100 price tag, the Hori Mario Kart Racing Wheel Pro Deluxe still boasts a workable set of specs. That 270\u00ba rotation angle isn't going to threaten the 900\u00ba or 1000\u00ba+ options available further up the price range, but it's certainly more than enough for the more casual player. On Mario Kart's tighter courses, the option of shifting things down to 180\u00ba keeps things far more precise too.\nPerformance: There are no fancy direct-drive systems or force feedback fun here - there's just no room in the price. However, there's still a nice level of resistance behind each twist and turn and especially satisfying pedals. It's difficult to find any racing wheels at $100 / \u00a3100, let alone something that actually feels fun to play with. For enthusiast Mario Kart players or folks just trying to spice up their balloon battles, this has to be one of the best Nintendo Switch controllers out there.\nThe best handheld-mode Switch controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCRKD's Nitro Deck feels like it's been created to solve a bunch of issues nobody else in the Switch controller market has thought of solutions for. If you have larger hands and like playing your Switch or Switch OLED in handheld mode, you might experience that stiff thumb cramp from having to contort your hands over the tiny joysticks and buttons. Similarly, if you've been plagued by joy-con stick drift, there aren't too many Hall Sensor options out there - especially ones that allow you to play in handheld mode. And what if you've been waiting for a Switch Pro to bring Nintendo's device up to the level of today's gaming handhelds?\n\u2705 You find the Switch in handheld mode uncomfortable: A larger design means this is much more comfortable to hold.\n\u2705 You need some extra functionality: Four back buttons is really going to broaden your horizons.\n\u2705 You want some color options: There are quite a few colorways from CRKD to choose from if you really want to personalize.\n\u274c You prefer symmetrical thumbsticks: If you want an even more authentic Steam Deck experience you might prefer the Nitro Deck+.\n\u274c You're planning to use it with a Switch 2: Because of those different dimensions, you won't be able to use this with a Switch 2.\nDesign & Features: Embracer Group's first bit of hardware from brand CRKD fills those gaps in the market with the Nitro Deck. This chunkier alternative to buying new joy-cons gives a much more comfortable feel if you have bigger hands and want to play in handheld mode for longer periods. Full-size Hall Sensor thumbsticks give you real peace of mind that you won't encounter any discomfort, or that annoying potentiometer problem.\nPerformance: On the face of it, the Nitro Deck emulates the look of the Nintendo Switch almost 1:1 when looking at it front-on. Besides a range of colorways and swappable thumbstick caps, buttons are laid out just the same. I will add, however, that all these buttons have a larger, more spread-out feel to them - even if the exact measurements aren't that far off the Joy-Cons. When you flip it over though, the back looks more like a Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally, and that's thanks to four well-placed back buttons you can map to your will.\nConveniently, the Nitro Deck does have some good connectivity if you don't just want to use it in handheld mode. Through two USB-C ports in the back, you can charge the Switch, as well as play PC games or Switch games using an empty deck as your pro controller.\nNintendo Switch controllers: FAQ\nHow to choose the right Switch controller for you\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nIf you're torn between which Nintendo Switch controllers will be best for you, the decision likely starts with two choices. You can either go premium with the official Joy-Con or Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, or pick out a cheaper third party alternative. If you opt for the former, you simply need to decide whether you favor handheld (Joy-Con) or docked (Pro Controller) play.\nHowever, grabbing a third party offering requires a little more forethought. Many of these gamepads do away with extra features like rumble, motion controls, and Amiibo functionality - so if any of these are a necessity it's time to go back to square one. However, if you're just after a spare gamepad it's worth checking the size and connectivity of the controller you're after, as well as whether there are any additional paddles, audio options, or design features that would be useful.\nYou'll find a quick breakdown of each Nintendo Switch controller type just below.\n- Joy-Cons: These are small controllers included with the console. Used as a pair, separately, or slotted onto the portable screen in handheld mode, they're ideal for multiplayer. Picking up an extra pair allows you to run four-player games, for example.\n- Nintendo Switch Pro Controller: Pro Controllers are more traditional. They consist of a classic all-in-one design with two thumbsticks, shoulder bumpers, triggers, and grips on the handles for superior control. They're ideal for games such as Super Smash Bros or Dark Souls due to the levels of precision they offer.\n- Third-party alternatives: These are controllers not made by Nintendo. They're usually much cheaper and look a lot like the official Pro Controller, but they usually lack some of the functionality. That makes them good spares.\nDo wireless controllers work with Nintendo Switch?\nThe Nintendo Switch can handle up to eight wireless controllers at one time, either in handheld or docked mode. However, it's worth noting that you won't be able to connect more than one wireless controller if you are also using the console's Bluetooth function for audio.\nWireless controllers do work on the Nintendo Switch Lite, which means tabletop play is still on the cards even if there's no docking functionality.\nDo Nintendo Switch controllers work with every model?\nWireless Nintendo Switch controllers will work with every console; the Lite, standard, and OLED versions. However, you'll only be able to use the vast majority of wired controllers with the standard edition or OLED model, as they require USB-A ports on the dock to connect.\nWhat are better than Joy-Cons?\nIf you're looking for an alternative to the Joy-Con controllers for Nintendo Switch, the Hori Split or the Hori D-Pad controllers are your best bet. They're cheaper, and they don't suffer from stick drift in the same way. That said, the Hori options can't be used wirelessly or for motion controls. Either way, if you're looking for an alternative, those are the best options.\nAre Nintendo Pro controllers worth it?\nIn our opinion, getting a pro controller for your Nintendo Switch can make the world of difference to your console's quality of life. Yes, playing on the go is excellent, but having a proper gamepad you can use when sinking more time into something like Tears of the Kingdom can really make the experience feel more next-gen. Depending on what you play, you might find some third party controllers with extra buttons too, which could come in handy.\nHow to stop a Nintendo Switch controller from drifting\nNintendo Switch controllers can suffer from thumbstick drift. All gamepads are vulnerable to this flaw, but it seem Joy-Con are particularly susceptible. That means it can pay to keep your console in good condition, investing in a case that leaves ample room for the thumbsticks to remain upright. However, even with all the love and attention in the world, those pesky sticks can still start running away from you.\nIf this happens it's worth first recalibrating the controls in the System Settings (Controllers and Sensors in the menu). If that doesn't help, it's time to get into the nitty gritty and clear out those sticks. You'll need a can of compressed air and a small screwdriver. You'll notice a small rubber flap at the base of your thumbstick, lift this gently with the screwdriver and carefully spray the area underneath with compressed air. This will dislodge any dirt or dust that's clogging the underside of your controller.\nIf all else fails, it's worth noting that Nintendo is operating a Joy-Con drift repair scheme free of charge.\nCan you replace one Joy-Con\nIf one of your Joy-Con is drifting, or you're simply looking to mix up your aesthetic, you can purchase single controllers - either an official Nintendo gamepad, or a Hori D-Pad model. Both come in less than $30 / \u00a330.\nWe're also rounding up all the best Nintendo Switch game sales, as well as the latest Ring Fit Adventure prices and all the best cheap Nintendo Switch SD cards. We're also showing you all the best Nintendo Switch chargers for the full kit. We're also showing you how to catch all the latest Nintendo Switch OLED restock updates.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I\u2019ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.\n- Tabitha BakerManaging Editor - Hardware"

      "text": "The GameSir G7 Pro is finally available to buy, bringing TMR thumbsticks to the Xbox masses for under $100\nOne of GameSir's priciest controllers is worth every penny\nThe GameSir G7 Pro is probably one of the most anticipated controller launches of 2025. Not only is this brand on fire from back-to-back years of releasing competitively priced, excellent gamepads, but when the G7 Pro was shown off at CES back in January, it had the rest of the Xbox Series X controller market sweating.\nAfter my GameSir G7 Pro review, I can see why they should all be worried. I think this might be the new \"best value\" controller in town since it offers TMR thumbsticks, four extra buttons, wireless connectivity, and a whole lot of comfort for just $79.99. After months of waiting, it's finally available now at Amazon, both in the US and the UK.\nGameSir G7 Pro | $79.99 at Amazon\nThe G7 Pro is excellent value for money, even if it is the most expensive GameSir controller. Most officially licensed Xbox controllers that have four back buttons come in well over $100, with most costing closer to the $200 mark.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You're looking for a great value controller\n\u2705 You want TMR thumbsticks\n\u2705 You'd like four extra buttons\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You want four back buttons\n\u274c You want wireless Xbox play\nUK: \u00a389.99 at Amazon\nIf you're used to GameSir's controllers, you'll know that 80 bucks actually feels like a pricey amount from this brand. Usually, its most premium offerings come in at $50-70, and despite that, they all feel like contenders for our best PC controller list. This is easily the budget brand king of the controller market, and while I still think there are a few things it could have done to make the G7 Pro feel more \"pro\", it's certainly one of the best officially licensed Xbox controllers on the shelves right now.\nFor starters, it packs in TMR thumbsticks, which are the new gold standard. TMR sticks are an advancement of the Hall effect technology we've seen in recent years. Along with being stick drift-immune, it's also capable of registering a much higher resolution of stick inputs, resulting in far greater accuracy and faster polling rates (if you play on PC).\nAlong with two back buttons, GameSir has supplied two additional shoulder buttons. Ideally, I'd have liked an extra set of back buttons to really make this a competitive FPS powerhouse, but even so, two extra bumpers bring it in line with the PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless in terms of functionality - all while costing $60 less.\nFollowing the trend of recent Xbox controllers, the G7 Pro gets a wireless charging stand that complements its design, which either comes in a minimalist white and grey or a red and black. There is a catch, however. While the G7 Pro is wireless on PC thanks to an included USB dongle, it can only play in wired mode on the Xbox consoles. This is a real bummer for Xbox fans, who will only be able to make use of the console's standard 400Hz polling rate (the G7 Pro can hit 1,000Hz at full speed).\nI imagine this is going to be a popular choice for many gamers on Xbox and PC over the next few years. If the G7 Pro feels a tad pricey for you, there's also the cheaper version, which I deem the best budget controller right now, the GameSir G7 SE.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nGet your money's worth:\n- All GameSir controllers at Amazon\n- All Xbox controller deals: Starting at $26.88 at Amazon\n- PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless: $127.98 at Amazon\nWant something cheaper? Check out the best Nintendo Switch controllers, the best PS4 controllers, and the best Xbox One controller.\nOne of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews.
