  "content": "By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the Poh Kong Holdings Berhad (KLSE:POHKONG) share price is up 36% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 8.3% (not including dividends).\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring three years of share price growth, Poh Kong Holdings Berhad achieved compound earnings per share growth of 35% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 3.44 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nDive deeper into Poh Kong Holdings Berhad's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Poh Kong Holdings Berhad's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Poh Kong Holdings Berhad the TSR over the last 3 years was 47%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nWe regret to report that Poh Kong Holdings Berhad shareholders are down 9.6% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 1.2%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 3% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Poh Kong Holdings Berhad .",

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling.

  "argos_summary": "Poh Kong Holdings Berhad\u2019s share price has risen 36% over the past three years, outpacing the market, but its EPS growth (35% p.a.) has outpaced share price growth, leading to a low P/E of 3.5x and cautious investor sentiment. The company\u2019s fundamentals are solid, with 17% revenue growth, 28% earnings growth, a 7.2% net margin and a 12.6% ROE, and dividends have boosted its total shareholder return to 47% over the period. Despite a 9.6% annual loss for shareholders in 2025, long\u2011term investors have earned roughly 3% per year over five years, suggesting a potential buying opportunity amid market jitters. The article also notes that U.S. midstream oil and gas firms are poised to benefit from Trump\u2019s \u201cunleash\u201d energy orders, highlighting broader sector dynamics.",
