As part of the agreement, Beal returned $13.9 million out of the $110 million on the final two years of his contract with the Suns, ESPN reported in July.\n\nBeal then agreed to a two-year deal with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nBeal's tenure was largely defined by his time away from the basketball court due to injury, while his discontent with the team also became a theme. But this week, Beal finally shared some details as to what led to his decision to join the Clippers.\n\n\"I need a ring. I need a ring. I want one bad,\" Beal told KMOV news. \"New environment, but a hungry environment, too. I\u2019m definitely excited for the opportunity to go win.\"\n\nWhile the Clippers have never won an NBA Finals or a conference title, the team has been competitive for more than a decade. The franchise has advanced to the postseason in 11 of the last 13 seasons.\n\nHowever, seven of those playoff runs resulted in first round exits. The Clippers did reach the Western Conference Finals in 2021, but were ultimately eliminated by the Suns.\n\nThis isn't the first time Beal has shared his hopes of competing for an NBA title. In March, Beal told ESPN that if he ultimately left Phoenix, he preferred to land with a contender.\n\n\"I enjoy the game, man,\" Beal said at the time. \"This game is fun. I try not to let nobody take the joy out of it for me. It\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s hard. We\u2019re all human beings, man. We have every right to shut down. We have every right to question what\u2019s going on. You have every right to say, \u2018Why me?\u2019 But I feel like that just drags you down a little bit more than you need.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBeal appeared in 53 games in each of his two seasons with the Suns. The guard now joins a Clipper roster that features James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, and recently added Brooke Lopez and John Collins. Chris Paul also agreed to return to Los Angeles this offseason.\n\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter",

      "text": "The NBA offseason still has a handful of unresolved situations and, with that, comes drama and buzz about the futures of the best free agents and potential trade targets.\nWe've got you covered, tracking all the rumors from in and around the league.\nAug. 9\nJonathan Kuminga-Josh Giddey trade on the table?\nCould the No. 6 and No. 7 picks in the 2021 NBA Draft be traded for each other? Such a scenario exists, as the Warriors have interest in a trade centered around sending Kuminga to the Chicago Bulls for Giddey, according to Bleacher Report. Both players are restricted free agents.\nLast season, Kuminga averaged 15.3 points in 24.3 minutes per game in 47 regular-season contests while shooting 45.4/30.5/66.8. Meanwhile, Giddey averaged 14.6 points, 8.1 rebounds, 7.2 assists and 1.2 steals per game while shooting 46.5/37.8/78.1. Furthermore, after Chicago traded Zach LaVine to the Sacramento Kings, Giddey averaged 20.2 points, 9.5 rebounds, 8.3 assists and 1.4 steals per game, while shooting 49.5/45.7/80.3 across his last 24 games. Giddey spent the first three seasons of his NBA career with the Oklahoma City Thunder before being acquired by Chicago in the 2023-24 NBA offseason.\nJuly 30\nJonathan Kuminga, Warriors not seeing eye-to-eye\nKuminga continues to reject a two-year, $45 million offer from the Warriors, per ESPN. Kuminga reportedly doesn't want a team option in the contract, while the Kings and Phoenix Suns have shown continued interest in acquiring Kuminga via a sign-and-trade and are willing to offer him a contract in the ballpark of a four-year, $90 million deal.\nJuly 28\nIs LeBron James interested in the Mavericks?\nNearly a month after he accepted his player option for the 2025-26 season, questions still linger around James' future with the Lakers. With nothing being reported as settled between the NBA's all-time scoring leader and the Lakers, James is believed to have a curiosity about potentially joining the Mavericks. However, Dallas is only interested in adding James if he were to be bought out of his contract. Joining the Mavericks would allow James to reunite with two of his top teammates ever: Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving. He could also join Cooper Flagg, the highly-touted first overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, as Dallas seeks to contend following a disappointing 2024-25 season that was defined by its shocking decision to trade Luka Don\u010di\u0107.\nJuly 26\nWarriors eyeing Giannis Antetokounmpo in the future?\nThe Warriors are being cautious about whether they want to commit to signing Kuminga to a long-term deal in the event that Antetokounmpo becomes available on the trade market, per The San Francisco Standard.\nJuly 19\nClippers are aiming to sign Chris Paul\nThe Clippers, who still have two open spots on their projected 15-man roster, are \"strongly considering\" signing the veteran free agent point guard, according to ClutchPoints. Paul, who started all 82 games for the San Antonio Spurs during his 20th season, is hoping to be a starter again for the 2025-26 season, per The Associated Press.\nJuly 18\nNuggets have \u2018no concerns\u2019 about Jonas Valanciunas reporting to camp\nAmid speculation over his NBA future, Valanciunas is expected to be with the team when the season starts. Nuggets general manager Ben Tenzer said the team has \"no concerns\" about the possibility of the newly added center not showing up for training camp this fall, according to HoopsHype. The 33-year-old was reportedly close to accepting a three-year contract offer from the EuroLeague, but the Nuggets were never motivated to let him out of his contract.\nJuly 13\nJayson Tatum recruiting Damian Lillard to Boston\nThe Celtics superstar is taking part in recruiting efforts to get free agent Lillard to Boston, according to a report from The Boston Globe. Lillard and Tatum are both expected to miss most or all of next season recovering from a torn Achilles injury. The pair previously played together on Team USA during the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nLast season, Lillard averaged 24.9 points in 58 games for the Milwaukee Bucks, who surprisingly released the nine-time All-Star and stretched the remaining $112.6 million owed to him over the next two seasons to clear cap room.\nJuly 12\nMultiple teams actively talking about trading for LeBron James\nFour teams have contacted James' agent about the possibility of trading for him, according to a report from ESPN on Saturday. The 40-year-old Lakers star opted into his $52.6 million player option with the team in June and neither side has discussed a contract extension, leading many to believe that James' time in Los Angeles is nearing an end. James averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, and 7.3 rebounds in 71 games for the Lakers last season. He's currently set to become an unrestricted free agent next summer.\nJuly 10\nGiannis Antetokounmpo dishes on future in live stream\nThere's still an air of uncertainty around Antetokounmpo's future with the Bucks, but he made one thing certain: he won't be taking his talents to the Big Apple.\nAntetokounmpo discussed the possibility of living and playing in New York during a stream with popular internet personality IShowSpeed. \"A lot of people have tried to convince me to play [in New York], but nah,\" Antetokounmpo said, further making it known that he wouldn't play for the New York Knicks or the Brooklyn Nets. Antetokounmpo was asked if that meant he'd be remaining with the Bucks. \"We'll see,\" he replied. \"Probably, I love Milwaukee.\"\nThough Antetokounmpo's name has been involved in trade rumors since the Bucks' first-round playoff exit, he has been relatively silent about his future in Milwaukee. He reportedly hasn't requested a trade, but ESPN reported in May that Antetokounmpo was more open to the idea of possibly moving on from Milwaukee than he was in the past.\nThe Bucks were arguably among the more aggressive teams in the first week of free agency. They surprisingly signed former Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner to a four-year deal. In another shocking move, they waived-and-stretched All-Star guard Lillard to make the deal happen, forcing them to take on the remaining $112 million on his contract. Antetokounmpo, 30, is under contract through the end of the 2027-28 season, but he can opt out of his deal following the 2026-27 season.\nJuly 8\nNikola Joki\u0107 not signing contract extension\nJoki\u0107 has reportedly informed the Nuggets that he won't sign a contract extension this offseason. Joki\u0107, a three-time MVP, was eligible to add three years at $212 million to his pre-existing contract, which has two years left at $106 million. It's likely that Joki\u0107 is choosing to put off signing an extension with the Nuggets until after this season, because if he waits until the 2026 offseason he can sign a deal in which he'd earn an additional $80 million. However, it's alarming as there has been some rumbling about the Nuggets' willingness to trade Joki\u0107 if it helped them avoid the second tax apron, and it's important they lock up arguably the sport's best player on a longer-term deal.\nJuly 6\nSuns, Bradley Beal buyout imminent\nThe Suns are expected to buyout Beal's contract in the coming days. The reported details of the buyout would cost Beal $13.9 million of his remaining $110.8 million deal. It would then clear the way for the Suns to waive Beal and stretch the remaining $96.9 million over the next five years and result in the team ducking both tax aprons. Once Beal clears waivers, potential suitors that could pick him up include the Clippers and the Miami Heat.\nJuly 2\nDamian Lillard fielding suitors\nLillard was waived by the Bucks and already has teams lining up to acquire his services despite being set to miss the entirety of the 2025-26 NBA season with an Achilles injury. Contenders such as the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics and Warriors are among the teams interested in bringing in the veteran point guard once he clears waivers. Lillard, who turns 35 on July 15, is a nine-time All-Star coming off his fourth straight All-Star season.\nDuring his two seasons in Milwaukee, whom he joined in a trade after 11 years in Portland, he averaged 24.6 points and seven assists per game. However, he wasn't able to make much of an impact on each of their postseason runs, as he dealt with a strained Achilles during the 2024 playoffs and returned from deep vein thrombosis midway through the Bucks' first-round series in the 2025 playoffs. He then sustained a torn Achilles in the elimination Game 5 against the Pacers this season.\nJune 30\nJordan Clarkson bought out\nClarkson and the Utah Jazz are reportedly finalizing a contract buyout. Clarkson, who is heading into his 12th NBA season, was set to make $14.3 million. Now, he will head to the open market and be one of the top unrestricted free agents in a rather weak 2025 class. Clarkson, who won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award in 2020-2021, averaged 16.2 points per game and 3.7 assists, while shooting a career-low 40.8% from the field.\nJune 29\nDeandre Ayton bought out\nThe former first overall pick is reportedly negotiating a contract buyout from the Trail Blazers. Ayton, 26, was under contract for $35.5 million this season. He's now arguably the most coveted center on the market. Ayton averaged 14.4 points, 10.2 rebounds and 1.0 blocks per game in 40 appearances for Portland last season.\nJabari Smith Jr. signs rookie extension\nThe Houston Rockets have a big-money commitment to the former third overall pick. Smith, who turned 22 in May, plans to sign a five-year, $122 million rookie contract extension that's fully guaranteed through the 2030-31 season. Smith started 39 games for Houston last season, averaging 12.2 points, 7.0 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game.\nJames Harden to stay with Clippers\nLike a couple of other stars ahead of free agency, Harden will also decline his player option for the 2025-26 season in order to sign an extension. The star guard intends to sign a two-year, $81.5 million extension with the Clippers after declining his player option for next season, ESPN reported. The deal will keep Harden in Los Angeles for at least a third season. As part of the new contract, Harden's contract for the 2026-27 season is reportedly partially guaranteed. Harden was named an All-Star for the 11th time this past season, helping the Clippers earn the fifth seed in the Western Conference before losing to the Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs.\nBobby Portis re-signs with Bucks\nPortis agreed to a three-year, $44 million deal with the Bucks ahead of his pending free agency, ESPN reported. Portis, 30, has arguably been one of the league's better role players over the last few years, but he only played 49 games last season due to a 25-game suspension for using Tramadol, an opioid pain medication.\nJulius Randle remains with Minnesota\nThe three-time All-Star forward has declined his player option for next season but will sign a three-year, $100 million extension with the Timberwolves, ESPN reported. The deal reportedly includes a player option for the 2027-28 season. Randle, 30, was a key piece for the Timberwolves in their run to a second straight Western Conference finals appearance, averaging 21.7 points per game in the postseason in his first year with the team. The Timberwolves acquired him in a deal with the Knicks just days before the start of training camp this past season.\nDorian Finney-Smith opts out of deal with Lakers\nThe veteran wing will test the open market, declining his $15.4 million player option for next season, ESPN reported. Finney-Smith was a key part of the Lakers' rotation after they acquired him in a midseason trade. The decision by Finney-Smith puts the Lakers roughly $9 million below the first luxury tax apron.\nOKC re-signs role players\nA pair of end-of-the-rotation players will remain in Oklahoma City after winning the NBA title. Both Jaylin Williams and Ajay Mitchell have agreed to new deals ahead of hitting the open mark, ESPN reported. Williams' deal is reportedly a three-year, $24 million pact with an option for the third year, while Mitchell's deal is a three-year, $9 million pact.\nDuncan Robinson to become a free agent\nThe veteran wing, who's known for his prowess as a 3-point shooter, will test free agency. He is declining his $20 million early termination option with the Heat, but is still looking to work out a deal with the team, according to ESPN.\nJune 28\nOKC trades Dillon Jones to Washington\nThe Thunder are trading guard Jones and a second-round pick to the Wizards, according to ESPN. The Wizards are also sending guard Colby Jones to the Thunder, who will then release him.\nDavion Mitchell sticking with Heat\nMitchell intends to sign a two-year, $24 million deal to return to Miami, according to ESPN. The 26-year-old guard was a bright spot for Miami after being traded from Toronto as part of the multi-team deal that sent Jimmy Butler to Golden State.\nNicolas Batum opts out of Clippers deal\nBatum is declining his $4.9 million player option for the 2025-26 season to become a free agent, according to ESPN, although there remains interest in a new deal between the veteran forward and the Clippers.\nSam Merrill inks new deal with Cavaliers\nMerrill will sign a four-year, $38-million contract to stay in Cleveland, according to ESPN. The 28-year-old averaged 7.2 points per game on 40.6% shooting from the field, including 37.2% from distance, in 71 appearances last season.\nGSW tenders offer to Jonathan Kuminga\nKuminga is expected to become a restricted free agent after the Warriors offered him a $7.9 million qualifying offer, according to ESPN. The Warriors have the right to match any offer and can explore sign-and-trade options as well. Kuminga fell in and out of the rotation for Steve Kerr last season after the trade for Butler, but the Warriors still consider him a priority signing this offseason.\nJune 27\nT-wolves intend to sign Naz Reid to new deal\nAll signs pointed towards Reid declining his $15 million player option after the 2025 season, but it was unclear if that would lead to a summer of free agency or a new deal with the Timberwolves. Now, it seems the latter is more likely. Reid intends to sign a five-year, $125 million deal that would keep him in Minnesota through the 2030 season. Reid, the NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2024, posted career-bests in points (14.2) and rebounds per game (6.0) last season.\nSuns, Devin Booker \"active in working out\" record extension\nThe Suns remain steadfast in building around guard Booker. The 10-year veteran is coming off a 2024-25 season in which he averaged 25.6 points per game, his lowest mark since 2018, to go with a career-high 7.1 assists per game. Booker has three years remaining on a four-year, $220 million contract he signed prior to last season but is eligible for \u2014 and reportedly working toward \u2014 a record extension, which would tack on an additional two years at $150 million ($75 million AAV) and keep him under contract in Phoenix through the 2031 season.\nSixers pick up Andre Drummond's team option\nInstead of heading into the free-agent market, Drummond will make $5 million for the final year of a two-year contract he signed prior to the 2024-25 season with the 76ers. The two-time All-Star averaged 7.3 points and 7.8 rebounds during his 13th NBA season last year.\nRaptors part ways with president Masai Ujiri\nUjiri became Toronto's executive vice president and general manager in 2013 and was the architect of the team's 2019 NBA Finals triumph, the team's lone championship. The Raptors are coming off a 30-52 season and haven't won a playoff series since the 2019-20 NBA season.\nJune 26\nAustin Reaves rejects extension offer\nReaves turned down a four-year, $89.2 million extension offer from the Lakers, according to The Athletic. This was the maximum offer that the Lakers could make to Reaves, who signed a four-year, $53.8 million contract with the Lakers in 2023; Reaves is entering the third season of that deal, which includes a $14.9 million player option for the 2026-27 season. Last season, Reaves averaged a career-high 20.2 points, 5.8 assists and 1.1 steals per game, while shooting 46.0/37.7/87.7. The Lakers went 50-32 and claimed the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference before losing to the Timberwolves in five games in the first round of the playoffs.\nJune 25\nKnicks interviewing James Borrego\nNew York is interviewing Borrego, the former head coach of the Charlotte Hornets and a current assistant coach for the New Orleans Pelicans, for its head-coaching vacancy, according to ESPN. Across Borrego's four seasons as its head coach (2018-19 season to 2021-22 season), Charlotte went a combined 148-183. He has been part of head coach Willie Green's coaching staff in New Orleans the past two seasons. Borrego is the fourth person who has interviewed with the Knicks, with former Sacramento Kings head coach Mike Brown, former Memphis Grizzlies head coach Taylor Jenkins and Timberwolves assistant Micah Nori being the other three.\nJohn Collins opts into player option with Jazz\nCollins has opted into his player option for the 2025-26 season instead of testing free agency. The veteran forward averaged 19 points per game and 8.2 rebounds throughout his eighth season. He could have commanded a line of suitors on the open market, but it's possible no team would have offered him more than the $26.58 million he's set to make by remaining with the Jazz.\nFred VanVleet, Rockets agree to new deal\nHouston is signing VanVleet to a two-year, $50 million deal, according to ESPN. VanVleet had a $44.9 million team option in the final year of his three-year, $128.5 million deal for next season, which Houston was set to decline. The 31-year-old averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 assists and 1.6 steals per game, while shooting 37.8/34.5/81.0 last season.\nJune 24\nPelicans, Wizards make four-player trade\nNew Orleans is trading CJ McCollum, Kelly Olynyk and a future second-round pick to Washington for Jordan Poole, Saddiq Bey and the No. 40 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, according to ESPN. McCollum is entering the final season of a two-year, $64 million deal, while Poole is entering the third season of a four-year, $128 million deal. The Wizards and Pelicans each missed the playoffs last season.\nJune 23\nDaniel Gafford intends to sign extension with Mavericks\nThe center, who's set to enter his seventh season, has one year remaining on a three-year, $40.1 million deal that he signed in 2023. Gafford's next deal is expected to be another three-year extension, worth $60 million, that would run through the 2028-29 season. It would be a boost in pay for Gafford after a career-best season in which he averaged 12.3 points per game and 6.8 rebounds.\nKhris Middleton staying with Wizards\nMiddleton has picked up his $33.3 million player option with the Wizards for the 2025-26 season, according to ESPN. The three-time NBA All-Star was traded to Washington ahead of the NBA trade deadline by the Bucks. The 33-year-old has been dealing with ankle injuries and only made 37 appearances last season for both teams. Middleton helped the Bucks win the 2019 NBA Finals.\nJune 22\nKevin Durant to Rockets in megatrade\nDurant will join the Rockets in a blockbuster trade that will see him leave the Suns, according to ESPN. In return, the Suns will reportedly receive veteran guards Jalen Green and Dillon Brooks. They'll also receive six draft picks, including the No. 10 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. The other five picks are second-round selections. Durant, who will be 37 at the start of next season, is entering the final season of a four-year, $194.2 million deal.\nJune 19\nRockets extend head coach Ime Udoka\nHouston signed Udoka to a \"long-term\" extension that makes him one of the highest-paid head coaches in the NBA, according to ESPN. Earlier this month, the Rockets denied the Knicks permission to speak with Udoka about their head-coaching vacancy after they fired Tom Thibodeau. In Udoka's second season as head coach, the Rockets went 52-30, claiming the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference before losing to the Warriors in the first round of the playoffs. Houston is a combined 93-71 under Udoka, who was previously the head coach of the Celtics in the 2021-22 NBA season, with Boston reaching the NBA Finals.\nJune 15\nMagic land Desmond Bane from Grizzlies\nThe Magic have acquired Bane from the Grizzlies for guards Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Cole Anthony, along with four unprotected first-round picks and a first-round pick swap, ESPN reported. The picks Memphis is receiving are the No. 16 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, the Suns' 2026 first-round pick in 2026, Orlando's 2028 unprotected first-round pick and Orlando's 2030 first-round pick. The pick swap is a lightly protected first-round pick in 2029, according to ESPN. Bane, who'll turn 27 later in June, has been a big reason why the Grizzlies have made the playoffs in three of the last four seasons. The 2020 first-round pick has averaged 20.2 points per game in that stretch, including 19.2 points per game this past season. He's also been among the game's top 3-point shooters over that time, making 40.7% of his attempts from deep since the start of the 2021-22 season.\nJune 14\nRockets extend Steven Adams\nHouston signed Adams to a three-year, $39 million extension, ESPN reported. Adams, who will be 32 at the start of next season, averaged 3.9 points and 5.6 rebounds per game this year in his first healthy season with the Rockets.\nJune 13\nRussell Westbrook to decline option, become free agent\nWestbrook will decline his $3.4 million player option with the Nuggets for the 2025-2026 season, per ESPN. Westbrook is recovering from hand surgery to repair multiple fractures sustained during the season, but in the past those types of injuries have cost him 14 and 12 games in a season, respectively, so the expectation is that he'd be ready to go well before training camp in the fall. The veteran guard averaged 13.3 points and 6.1 assists while shooting nearly 52% on 2-point attempts in 75 games for the Nuggets.\nJune 12\nSpurs, 76ers discussing first-round pick swap\nPer multiple reports, Philadelphia has discussed moving up in the draft from No. 3 to No. 2 with San Antonio. The Spurs already have a full backcourt \u2014 which is where the presumed second-overall selection, Rutgers' Dylan Harper, would end up \u2014 while the Sixers are looking to add to their own backcourt that already includes Tyrese Maxey. Whether the Spurs would actually look for a deal that would net them some additional draft assets to make up for the gap between the second and third picks is unknown, but the two teams have at least discussed the swap.\nJune 11\nHeat and Tyler Herro working toward extension\nThe Heat and Herro seem to be on the same page as the two sides work toward an extension. Herro is entering the penultimate year of his prior deal, in which he's set to be paid $31 million in 2025-26 and $33 million in 2026-27. The extension he and the Heat are eyeing is reportedly a three-year deal, worth $149.7 million ($49.9 million AAV). The potential raise is warranted for Herro, who's coming off a 2024-25 season in which he posted career-bests in points (23.9 per game) and assists (5.5) and earned his first All-Star nod.\nJune 2\nRaptors eyeing offseason shake-up \u2014 is Giannis Antetokounmpo on the table?\nAfter three consecutive playoff-less seasons, Toronto is looking to make changes and will reportedly try to acquire a \"big fish\" this offseason. Getting Antetokounmpo would be like reeling in a great white shark. Toronto has accumulated players with the salaries needed to build a package for a move like this \u2014 trading for and extending Brandon Ingram, RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley. Realistically, if Antetokounmpo is on the table, nobody should be off limits for Toronto, including young star Scottie Barnes. It would make sense for Antetokounmpo, too, because, while he hasn't formally asked to be traded away from Milwaukee, he's expressed a desire to stay in a much weaker Eastern Conference. According to an ESPN report from May, the two-time MVP said he's \"open-minded about exploring whether his best long-term fit is remaining in Milwaukee or playing elsewhere.\"\nCheck back for updates.\nWant great stories delivered right to your inbox?

      "text": "James Harden is a guard in the NBA who has played for Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Brooklyn Nets and his current team, the Philadelphia 76ers. He makes a large salary from both being in the NBA and his long term deal with Adidas and does it all with his signature look, which of course includes his beard that he has had since his start in the NBA.\nHarden was born on August 26, 1989, in Los Angeles, California to parents James Harden Sr. and Monja Willis. He played basketball at Artesia High School and continued into college at Arizona State. While at Arizona state, he earned the title of Pac-10 Conference Player in 2009.\nIn 2009, Harden was the third pick in the NBA draft for the Oklahoma City Thunder. A few years later, in 2012, he was on the gold metal winning U.S. Olympic team. That same year, in October, Oklahoma City Thunder announced that they were trading Harden to the Houston Rockets. He played for them for nearly 10 years, until 2021. He found a lot of success with the Houston Rockets and became one of the best three point shooters in the NBA. In 2018, he became the first player in NBA history to score 60 points in a triple-double and he was awarded the title of Most Valuable Player. Since then, he has played for two additional teams, the Brooklyn Nets for one year and the Philadelphia 76ers, who he plays for now. Harden has dealt with a hamstring injury for the last couple of years.\nHarden has made money from endorsement deals. He had a contract with Nike but when that ended, he signed a 13 year endorsement deal with Adidas in 2015. His shoes are his staple item, but he also has other athletic clothing with Adidas.\nSince Harden has been part of the NBA for over 10 years now he has become a very recognizable player in the league. One thing he is known for is his beard, so much so that his nickname has become \u201cthe beard.\u201d He has had it since playing in the NBA. He also is know for his \u201cstirring the pot\u201d move he does after he gets a shot as well as his famous \u201cEuro step\u201d move."

      "text": "KEVIN DURANT LOOKED around PHX Arena during the March 4 home game against the LA Clippers and saw a lot of people having a \"terrible time.\" The Phoenix Suns, losers of 11 of their previous 14, had given up 41 points in the second quarter and trailed by 19 entering the fourth.\nThe first three quarters had encapsulated the season so far for the Suns, who must make up ground just to qualify for the play-in despite the highest payroll in NBA history. Disappointment, drama and dysfunction. Durant later downplayed his first-quarter sideline clash with coach Mike Budenholzer, portraying the animated argument stemming from a disagreement regarding offensive strategy as evidence of how much they care about righting the ship, but it was perceived in the moment as further proof of a disconnected Phoenix squad falling apart.\nThe fourth quarter, though, provided a glimpse of why hope still flickers for this edition of the Suns in Phoenix, at least throughout the team's new $100 million downtown headquarters. Durant led a flurry of scoring that cut the deficit to 10 -- waving his arms to whip the crowd into a frenzy at that point -- before sealing the comeback.\nMaybe that rally for a desperately needed comeback win over the Clippers will be a symbolic start of the Suns salvaging their season.\n\"I like that analogy,\" brash billionaire owner Mat Ishbia told ESPN a couple of days later. \"I'm going to use that with Coach when I talk to him.\"\nThe Suns have lost three of the four games since.\n\"So what's the reason?\" Ishbia said, rhetorically asking why the Suns have fallen so far short of expectations. \"I don't have the answer. If I had the answer, I'd fix it right now.\n\"I still believe in our team. I still believe in Coach Budenholzer. I believe in the guys we have. And at the same time, at the end of the season, if we don't get to where we expect to get to, I'll have enough data and evidence that it didn't work or it did work. And then we'll make decisions based on that.\"\nIshbia's fingerprints have been all over the Suns' aggressive, expensive roster makeover during his 25 months in charge, beginning with pulling off the blockbuster trade for Durant as the ink was drying on his deal to buy the franchise for $4 billion. The Suns made a conscious decision to blow past the salary cap's second apron in the new collective bargaining agreement -- and the roster-building handcuffs that come with that territory -- when they persuaded Bradley Beal to waive his no-trade clause to accept a deal sending him to Phoenix from Washington in June 2023.\nThe Suns put together the priciest star trio in the NBA -- homegrown franchise cornerstone Devin Booker, Durant and Beal are all on maximum contracts -- and didn't get a single playoff win to show for it last season, when the Minnesota Timberwolves swept Phoenix in the first round.\nCoach Frank Vogel was fired after his first season on the job, a year after Ishbia dismissed Monty Williams. A series of injuries to each of the stars, preventing them from establishing chemistry, was a reasonable excuse, although the Suns have been relatively healthy this season. Phoenix's brass believed it addressed its primary roster flaw by signing steady point guard Tyus Jones in free agency.\nBut the Suns have taken a step back this season, sitting six games behind .500 and in 11th place in the West standings with 16 games remaining in the regular season, beginning with Friday's road date in Sacramento. February was especially miserable in Phoenix, as the Suns went 3-10 in a month in which Beal and Durant dealt with the distraction of being involved in trade discussions leading up to the Feb. 6 deadline. Budenholzer has had friction with multiple players, including Booker, sources said.\n\"It's been a really disappointing year. Very disappointed,\" Ishbia said. \"There's not a person in the organization that doesn't feel that way. We had high expectations. We felt really good about where going into the season and we've not met any of those expectations. We've been well below what we all expected, and it's not anything close.\"\nIn his next breath, Ishbia reiterated that a postseason bid is still within the Suns' reach.\n\"If we get in the playoffs, I don't think that we're an easy out for anybody,\" Ishbia said.\nAnd if they don't, Phoenix's front office will again explore all sorts of potential personnel scenarios as the Suns search for solutions while operating under Ishbia's \"all-in\" mandate. According to Ishbia, a \"pivot and reload\" around Booker could be the direction the franchise chooses this summer. The futures of Beal and Durant in Phoenix are uncertain after the Suns engaged in trade discussions involving them before this year's deadline. The belief within the front office is that the Suns aren't as far away from contending as the standings indicate.\nAs a source close to Ishbia said, \"For better or worse, there's no 'trust the process' to Mat Ishbia.\"\nTHERE IS ONE absolute certainty as the Suns approach what might be a summer of major change: Booker will not be traded.\nNever mind that there are plenty of rival executives who would advise Ishbia and the Suns to consider listening to offers, specifically from the Houston Rockets, who control a significant chunk of Phoenix's future first-round capital (2025 swap rights, 2027 and 2029 picks, all unprotected) via a deal with the Brooklyn Nets. Sources have told ESPN that the Rockets have repeatedly expressed interest in Booker, a 28-year-old star who fits Houston's timeline, and that those conversations have been brief.\n\"Never happen,\" Ishbia said, interrupting the question. \"It's silly. So here's what I'll tell you: I have Devin Booker in the prime. In order to win an NBA championship, you got to have a superstar. You got to have a great player.\"\nNor will Booker request a trade, regardless of how the Suns finish this season. Booker says he is fully committed to spending his entire career in Phoenix, sharing that vision with Ishbia and the Suns' lead executives, CEO Josh Bartelstein and general manager James Jones.\nBooker endured four years in or near the West basement to begin his career, averaging more than 60 losses while playing for four head coaches in those four seasons. The Suns made a leap to mediocrity in the first year under Williams, when Booker made his All-Star debut, and were two wins away from a title the following season. After getting a peek at the top of the mountain in 2021, Booker is determined to complete that climb in a Suns uniform.\n\"I mean, it's a rare breed,\" Booker told ESPN, wearing a T-shirt with his idol Kobe Bryant's Black Mamba logo as he explained after a recent shootaround why playing for only one franchise is so important to him. \"I take pride in the community in Phoenix, the people that have supported me since I was 18 when things were ugly. And the people that are with us, we just fell short of accomplishing what we want. So I want to do it, and I want to do it here.\n\"That's the responsibility of being a franchise player, and I wear that with honor. So it might not look the most pretty right now, but we got to get it done and I'm going to do it.\"\nIshbia acknowledges that positioning the Suns to realistically pursue their championship ambitions will probably require some roster remodeling around Booker.\nIt's insulting to Ishbia to suggest that a patient rebuilding process might be in the best interest of the Suns, who have given up control of their own first-rounders through 2031 under his watch.\n\"It's surprising to me that other people, other fans, they actually like the rebuild process,\" Ishbia said, disdain dripping from his voice as the final word of that sentence comes out of his mouth. \"Like, 'Oh, let's rebuild it.' Are you crazy?! You think I'm going to go for seven years and try to get there? You enjoy the 2030 draft picks that we have holding? I want to try to see the game today. I want us to win today, and we're going to try.\n\"Although let's say this doesn't work, guess what? Maybe next year we won't be as good, but we're going to try again. The next opportunity we have, we're going to try to win and compete. And it will work. We will win championships here in Phoenix. Might not be this year, but I promise you we are going to do it. And that's what we're focused on.\"\nBarring a drastic late-season turnaround for the Suns, there is anticipation around the league that Phoenix will entertain trade offers for Durant again this summer.\n\"I'll just say that we're going to evaluate in the offseason,\" Ishbia said. \"We're going to find a way to win, and it's probably a lot easier winning with Kevin Durant than without him. But at the same time, yes, if we're not good enough in this iteration of the Phoenix Suns, we're going to find a way to be better next year. \"\nDURANT WAS CAUGHT off guard when he was the subject of trade talks in the days leading up to this season's deadline, including a proposed deal with the Golden State Warriors that died after Durant made it clear he wasn't in favor of a midseason reunion with his former team.\nThe Suns had also discussed frameworks of potential Durant trades with the Timberwolves, Miami Heat and Rockets, according to league sources, some of whom also mentioned the New York Knicks as a potential fit. Rockets sources told ESPN their discussions with Phoenix were initiated by the Suns.\n\"When you're not winning and you're not winning the way you want, you've got to look at everything,\" a Suns source told ESPN. \"For us with him, it was, how do we make sure that we're optimizing Devin and building to make you successful now but also in the future. And Kevin's had an amazing year. He's had an amazing stretch here. He's playing really, really good basketball, but there's always been conversation with everyone on our team minus Devin Booker.\n\"As we talked about it, then teams call us because they're interested because it's Kevin Durant, we're not in a position not to look at everything. We have to be creative.\"\nLeague sources said that Durant and Rich Kleiman, the 15-time All-Star's agent and business partner, would be consulted on any trade discussions involving him this summer. Durant has one season remaining on his contract and would be eligible to sign a two-year, $122 million extension with a team that acquires him, providing him significant power to influence a potential trade destination.\n\"I want my career to end on my terms -- that's the only thing,\" Durant said on \"The Draymond Green Show\" in the aftermath of the trade deadline. \"That's the only thing I'm worried about. 'Cause I see a lot of dudes that don't get that opportunity, so I want to keep putting in that work to make that choice on my own.\"\nDurant declined further comment on the situation when approached by ESPN, saying it is \"already noisy as hell\" and he didn't want to add to that. His professionalism, focus and competitiveness in the wake of the trade deadline have been noted and appreciated throughout the Suns franchise.\nBeal dealt with hearing his name in trade rumors for most of the first half of the season, despite still possessing his no-trade clause, as the Suns unsuccessfully attempted to find a pathway to trade for Jimmy Butler. He was also demoted to a bench role in early January, returning to the starting lineup Feb. 22, when the Suns snapped a four-game losing streak by beating the Chicago Bulls.\nThe role change prompted speculation that the demotion was intended to make Beal disgruntled enough to accept a midseason trade, but team sources are adamant that utilizing Beal as a sixth man was purely a basketball strategy decision.\nNevertheless, Beal admits that he has felt disrespected at times by the Suns this season.\n\"I'm human, so I have to really take a step back and just kind of look at the big picture,\" Beal told ESPN. \"And my biggest thing is when I came here I want to win. I've scored 30 points a game. I've been an All-Star. I've been All-NBA. I want to win. That's always been my label -- I haven't won anything. So whatever that looks like for the team, whether that's me coming up the bench, whether it's me starting, whether it's me, whatever it is, I'm going to do it. Do I agree with it? Hell, no, but I'm not going to be that guy.\n\"I enjoy the game, man. This game is fun. I try not to let nobody take the joy out of it for me. It's very hard. It's hard. We're all human beings, man. We have every right to shut down. We have every right to question what's going on. You have every right to say, 'Why me?' But I feel like that just drags you down a little bit more than you need. I'm still playing in the NBA, I still have the best job in the world, and I still have my no-trade clause. So I'm smiling every day.\"\nLike Durant, Beal had no interest in having his life uprooted with a midseason trade. But Beal, whose longtime agent, Mark Bartelstein, is the Suns CEO's father, is open to considering other possibilities this offseason.\n\"It is a different deal in the summer,\" Beal said. \"Everything is kind of more laid out on the table. You got more options.\"\nDAYS AFTER PHOENIX'S 2023-24 season ended in a first-round sweep, Ishbia defiantly declared that the Suns had \"enough talent to win a championship,\" a claim he believed again entering this season. He also insisted during that news conference that 26 of the other 29 NBA general managers would swap situations with the Suns -- roster, future draft picks and all -- a statement that was mocked around the league within minutes of Ishbia saying it.\n\"Not based on our season this year, right?\" Ishbia said this month when asked if he still thinks that is true.\nIshbia didn't double down on his 26 of 29 take, but he didn't back all the way off, either. He downplayed the perception that the Suns are stuck in basketball purgatory due to trading as many of their future first-round picks as possible and have roster-building restrictions due to being so far over the salary cap and into the luxury tax.\n\"The thing is, I feel really good about our organization, the franchise, the basketball,\" Ishbia said. \"If we had won 15 more games than we won right now, I'd feel amazing about it all, but I feel that we're in a great position in Phoenix.\"\nAt this point, the Suns' position puts them in serious jeopardy of sending a lottery pick to the Rockets in the upcoming draft. Phoenix is 2\u00bd games behind the injury-ravaged Dallas Mavericks for the West's final play-in spot.\n\"But [the season is] not over yet, so that's kind of my mindset,\" Beal said. \"I'm always going to be the naive guy. I played in D.C. for 11 years, so naive is kind of my middle name. We still haven't played our best basketball. ... We have the toughest [remaining] schedule in the league, too, so it's a good challenge for us. Either we can s--- or get off the pot.\"\nIshbia added that his analysis of the Suns' favorable positioning among NBA franchises included the consideration that most GMs would enjoy having \"access to an owner that does not worry about how much we're spending and is willing to recruit people.\" But Ishbia is aware that he has been accused by rivals and the media of having \"new owner syndrome,\" which is a way of saying he makes impulsive, splashy decisions instead of taking a patient approach.\nIshbia and some members of the Suns' front office consider that an unfair portrayal. Ishbia, a feisty former walk-on guard at Michigan State, is responsible for Phoenix's win-now philosophy and financing it. He approves all personnel decisions, but he does not dictate them or make moves that aren't advised by his basketball operations staff.\n\"People like to say, 'Oh, he's too involved.' What?\" said Ishbia, who splits his time between Phoenix and Pontiac, Michigan, where the headquarters of his family's United Wholesale Mortgage are located. \"Honestly, you think I watched film on the players we're drafting? They say, 'We like Ryan Dunn.' I say, 'OK, how do we get him?' I don't watch film, I don't interview the player. It's just silly what people talk about.\"\nIshbia considers it his obligation as an owner to \"give the best resources, give the support, make sure that we make it a destination in Phoenix, create a great fan experience.\" He feels that he is doing all of those things, from making the nine-figure investment in the franchise's new headquarters to slashing concession prices. And he's paying more than $450 million, including luxury tax, for this season's roster.\n\"I'm not sparing dollars,\" Ishbia said. \"Fans don't care what a luxury tax bill is. They care that I care and I'm trying to help us win, and I'm giving the GM and the CEO and the coach and the players all the resources to win. And I think that's something that a lot of GMs and a lot of basketball people would really relish the opportunity to be part of.\"\nBut right now? Phoenix's middling results, along with Ishbia's bold, brash style, have made the Suns subject to ridicule.\n\"It's easy to take shots,\" Ishbia said. \"And I guess the biggest thing is when you put yourself out there -- which I will always do, so you can have fun with this for a long time -- when you put yourself out there and saying you want to win and be the best and you don't, people really enjoy when you don't. So that's what's happened. We haven't been where we wanted to be.\n\"I could have come in with low expectations, say, 'Hey, in the next five years, we're going to try to build this the right way. In eight years, maybe we'll win a championship.' I came in and said, 'Let's try to win now.' And guess what? I'll say that again next year and the year after, and one of these years we're going to win it.\n\"And I'm not just ruling out this year, but at the same time it has not been good this year, and we know that here.\""
