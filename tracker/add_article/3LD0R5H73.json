      "summary": "A 25‑bp Fed rate cut on Sept. 17 could revive Bitcoin’s basis trade by boosting futures premiums and open interest. Current 8‑% annualized basis is unattractive until rates ease, and tighter funding has kept volatility low. If the Fed cuts, liquidity could lift risk‑asset demand, lifting CME futures and re‑igniting the spread between spot and futures.",
