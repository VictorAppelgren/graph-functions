  "content": "American officials scrambling this weekend to identify and lock down a venue for Friday\u2019s summit between President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart quickly discovered a major snag: summertime is peak tourist season in Alaska, and options both available and equipped to host the two world leaders were severely limited.\n\nWhen word reached certain prominent Alaskans that Trump and Putin were coming, a few began reaching out to the president\u2019s allies with a proposition: could their home be an option? It\u2019s unclear if those offers ever reached White House officials, who were calling sites in Juneau, the state capital, along with Anchorage and Fairbanks.\n\nOrganizers of the summit soon came to believe the only city in the massive state with viable options for the summit would be Anchorage. And only Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, on the northern edge of the city, would meet the requirements for the historic meeting, though the White House had hoped to avoid the optics of hosting the Russian leader and his entourage on a US military installation.\n\nThat is where the two men will meet Friday, two White House officials said.\n\nThe struggle underscored the rush now underway to nail down the details of Friday\u2019s meeting, the first time the top US and Russian leaders have met in more than four years. The summit is still largely a work in progress as US and Russian officials make haste to prepare for the high-profile encounter. The two countries\u2019 top diplomats \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov \u2014 spoke Tuesday to discuss \u201ccertain aspects of preparation,\u201d according to Russia\u2019s foreign ministry.\n\nUsually, a high-stakes summit with a US adversary would be preceded by extensive negotiations over the agenda and outcomes. But Trump himself has said he is approaching the meeting as a \u201cfeel-out\u201d session, with few advance expectations for how it will proceed. The White House on Tuesday termed it a \u201clistening session.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president feels like, \u2018look, I\u2019ve got to look at this guy across the table. I need to see him face to face. I need to hear him one-on-one. I need to make an assessment by looking at him,\u2019\u201d Rubio said in a morning radio interview Tuesday with Sid Rosenberg, offering one explanation for why Trump\u2019s five known phone calls with Putin this year wouldn\u2019t suffice in determining the Russian leader\u2019s intentions.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration and the Kremlin landed on Alaska as the site for the summit after a lengthy behind-the-scenes back-and-forth, according to people familiar with the matter. There were few places that would work for the sit-down, the people said, particularly given a war crimes warrant issued for Putin\u2019s arrest by the International Criminal Court in 2023.\n\nWith that fact looming, Russia balked at a European destination \u2014 even in a city like Vienna or Geneva, where US and Russian leaders have met dating back to the Cold War. While Putin himself raised the United Arab Emirates as an \u201centirely suitable\u201d location, many inside the White House hoped to avoid another lengthy trek to the Middle East after Trump\u2019s visit in May.\n\nIn the end, sources said, it came down to Hungary \u2014 whose Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n is close to both Trump and Putin \u2014 and the United States as possible hosts, according to two US officials.\n\nAmerican officials were pleased and somewhat surprised when the Russian president agreed to a meeting on US soil \u2014 on land that once was part of the Russian empire, no less.\n\n\u201cI thought it was very respectful that the president of Russia is coming to our country as opposed to us going to his country or even a third-party place,\u201d Trump said this week, as his team was rushing to finalize details of the summit.\n\nOthers were not so taken.\n\n\u201cThe only better place for Putin than Alaska would be if the summit were being held in Moscow,\u201d said Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton, who fell out with Trump during his first term. \u201cSo, the initial setup, I think, is a great victory for Putin.\u201d\n\nThe last time an American president met with Putin \u2014 President Joe Biden\u2019s 2021 summit in Geneva \u2014 the date and venue were announced three weeks ahead of time. But the planning between Russian and American officials started months before that.\n\nBiden, on a week-long swing through Europe, spent the days leading up to the sit-down in intensive preparation with top advisers, blocking out time in the mornings to parse potential directions the conversation could take and anticipate some of Putin\u2019s moves. He consulted other leaders, including the German chancellor, for pointers on how to approach the notoriously wily Russian leader.\n\nBy the time the summit arrived, aides had planned the day down to the most minute detail, including what order the leaders would arrive, how long each session would last and what type of flower would sit on the table (it was white roses). American officials even ensured there were bottles of orange Gatorade \u2014 labeled \u201cPOTUS\u201d \u2014 inside a refrigerator at the 18th-century villa where the meeting took place.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, he and Putin sat one-on-one in Helsinki, Finland, during a summit in 2018 that ended with a remarkable moment when Trump sided with Putin over US intelligence agencies on the question of Russian election interference. Trump also met Putin alone in 2017, during their first encounter at the G20 summit in Hamburg.\n\nWhile American and Russian officials have been in extensive conversations to prepare for the sit-down since it was agreed to last week, the encounter that prompted the event remains something of a mystery. Trump\u2019s foreign envoy Steve Witkoff visited Moscow last Wednesday for a meeting with Putin that resulted in the decision to meet, though what exactly Putin said in the meeting is still largely unknown.\n\nEuropean officials spent much of the last week trying to ascertain the parameters of a peace deal that Putin offered up, but some said they were frustrated by the lack of clarity offered by Witkoff, a real estate developer and longtime friend of Trump\u2019s.\n\nTrump plans to hear from European leaders in a virtual meeting on Wednesday, arranged by the Germans so the president can get their perspective ahead of the Friday meeting. And he has promised to get on the phone with them, along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, immediately after the summit concludes.\n\nBut Zelensky isn\u2019t expected to be in Alaska for the summit, so any potential trilateral meeting is off the table for now.\n\nInstead, Trump will spend at least part of the summit meeting with Putin one-on-one, the White House said Tuesday, allowing time for the two men to carry out a discussion unheard by anyone else aside from their translators.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the plan,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said when asked whether the two presidents would meet as a pair. \u201cAs for the other mechanics and logistics, I will let our team speak to that when they\u2019re ironed out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not atypical for leaders to meet alone with their counterparts, but Trump and Putin\u2019s relationship has been the subject of intense scrutiny. And during Trump\u2019s first term, even senior officials said they sometimes were left in the dark about what was discussed when aides were left out. In Trump\u2019s previous two meetings with Putin, both encounters included translators, but not high-ranking aides. After the Germany meeting, Trump reportedly asked his translator for his notes.\n\nFor his part, Putin has spent the days ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting placing phone calls to his remaining global allies \u2014 including some who have staged their own high-profile summits with Trump.\n\nThat included North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the Kremlin said Tuesday, who met three times with Trump during his first term, but still hasn\u2019t abandoned his nuclear weapons.",
