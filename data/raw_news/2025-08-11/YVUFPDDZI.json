  "title": "Republicans, Democrats alike exhort Trump: Keep security pact with Australia and UK alive",
  "description": "U.S. lawmakers are urging the Trump administration to maintain a security partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom to supply nuclear-powered submarines",
  "content": "The review comes as the Trump administration works to rebalance its global security concerns while struggling with a hollowed-out industrial base that has hamstrung U.S. capabilities to build enough warships. The review is being led by Elbridge Colby, the No. 3 Pentagon official, who has expressed skepticism about the partnership.\n\n\u201cIf we can produce the attack submarines in sufficient number and sufficient speed, then great. But if we can\u2019t, that becomes a very difficult problem,\" Colby said during his confirmation hearing in March. \u201cThis is getting back to restoring our defense industrial capacity so that we don\u2019t have to face these awful choices but rather can be in a position where we can produce not only for ourselves, but for our allies.\"\n\nUS cannot build enough ships\n\nAs part of the $269 billion AUKUS partnership, the United States will sell three to five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, with the first delivery scheduled as soon as 2032. The U.S. and the U.K. would help Australia design and build another three to five attack submarines to form an eight-boat force for Australia.\n\nA March report by the Congressional Research Service warned that the lack of U.S. shipbuilding capacities, including workforce shortage and insufficient supply chains, is jeopardizing the much-celebrated partnership. If the U.S. should sell the vessels to Australia, the U.S. Navy would have a shortage of attack submarines for two decades, the report said.\n\nThe Navy has been ordering two boats per year in the last decade, but U.S. shipyards have been only producing 1.2 Virginia-class subs a year since 2022, the report said.\n\n\u201cThe delivery pace is not where it needs to be\" to make good on the first pillar of AUKUS, Admiral Daryl Caudle, nominee for the Chief of Naval Operations, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month.\n\nAustralia has invested $1 billion in the U.S. submarine industrial base, with another $1 billion to be paid before the end of this year. It has agreed to contribute a total of $3 billion to uplift the U.S. submarine base, and it has sent both industry personnel to train at U.S. shipyards and naval personnel for submarine training in the United States.\n\n\"Australia was clear that we would make a proportionate contribution to the United States industrial base,\u201d an Australian defense spokesperson said in July. \u201cAustralia\u2019s contribution is about accelerating U.S. production rates and maintenance to enable the delivery of Australia\u2019s future Virginia-class submarines.\u201d\n\nThe three nations have also jointly tested communication capabilities with underwater autonomous systems, Australia's defense ministry said on July 23. Per the partnership, the countries will co-develop other advanced technologies, from undersea to hypersonic capabilities.\n\nAt the recent Aspen Security Forum, Kevin Rudd, the Australian ambassador to the United States, said his country is committed to increasing defense spending to support its first nuclear-powered sub program, which would also provide \u201cmassively expensive full maintenance repair facilities\" for the U.S. Indo-Pacific fleet based in Western Australia.\n\nRudd expressed confidence that the two governments \u201cwill work our way through this stuff.\u201d\n\nBruce Jones, senior fellow with the Strobe Talbott Center for Security, Strategy and Technology, told The Associated Press that the partnership, by positioning subs in Western Australia, is helping arm the undersea space that is \u201creally crucial to American deterrence and defense options in the Western Pacific.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right answer is not to be content with the current pace of submarine building. It\u2019s to increase the pace,\" Jones said.\n\nJennifer Parker, who has served more than 20 years with the Royal Australian Navy and founded Barrier Strategic Advisory, said it should not be a zero-sum game. \u201cYou might sell one submarine to Australia, so you have one less submarine on paper. But in terms of the access, you have the theater of choice from operating from Australia, from being able to maintain your submarines from Australia,\" Parker said. \u201cThis is not a deal that just benefits Australia.\"\n\nDefense policy is one of the few areas where Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the Trump administration, but their resolve is being tested with the Pentagon\u2019s review of AUKUS. So far, they have joined their Democratic colleagues in voicing support for the partnership.\n\nThey said the U.S. submarine industry is rebounding with congressional appropriations totaling $10 billion since 2018 to ensure the U.S. will have enough ships to allow for sales to Australia.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told the AP that support for AUKUS is strong and bipartisan, \u201ccertainly on the Armed Services Committee.\u201d\n\n\"There is a little bit of mystification about the analysis done at the Pentagon,\u201d Kaine said, adding that \u201cmaybe (what) the analysis will say is: We believe this is a good thing.\u201d",

      "text": "Senate rejects effort to restrain Trump on Iran as GOP backs his strikes on nuclear sites\nSenate rejects effort to restrain Trump on Iran as GOP backs his strikes on nuclear sites\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democratic efforts in the Senate to prevent President Donald Trump from further escalating with Iran fell short Friday, with Republicans blocking a resolution that marked Congress\u2019 first attempt to reassert its war powers following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.\nThe resolution, authored by Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, aimed to affirm that Trump should seek authorization from Congress before launching more military action against Iran. Asked Friday if he would bomb Iranian nuclear sites again if he deemed necessary, Trump said, \u201cSure, without question.\u201d\nThe measure was defeated in a 53-47 vote in the Republican-held Senate. One Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, joined Republicans in opposition, while Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote in favor.\nMost Republicans have said Iran posed an imminent threat that required decisive action from Trump, and they backed his decision to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites last weekend without seeking congressional approval.\n\u201cOf course, we can debate the scope and strategy of our military engagements,\u201d said Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn. \u201cBut we must not shackle our president in the middle of a crisis when lives are on the line.\u201d\nDemocrats cast doubt on that justification, arguing the president should have come to Congress first. They also said the president did not update them adequately, with Congress\u2019 first briefings taking place Thursday.\n\u201cThe idea is this: We shouldn\u2019t send our sons and daughters into war unless there\u2019s a political consensus that this is a good idea, this is a national interest,\u201d Kaine said in a Thursday interview with The Associated Press. The resolution, Kaine said, wasn\u2019t aimed at restricting the president\u2019s ability to defend against a threat, but that \u201cif it\u2019s offense, let\u2019s really make sure we\u2019re making the right decision.\u201d\nIn a statement following Friday\u2019s vote, Kaine said he was \u201cdisappointed that many of my colleagues are not willing to stand up and say Congress\u201d should be a part of a decision to go to war.\nDemocrats\u2019 argument for backing the resolution centered on the War Powers Resolution, passed in the early 1970s, which requires the president \u201cin every possible instance\u201d to \u201cconsult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces.\u201d\nSpeaking on the Senate floor ahead of Friday\u2019s vote, Paul said he would back the resolution, saying that \u201cdespite the tactical success of our strikes, they may end up proving to be a strategic failure.\u201d\n\u201cIt is unclear if this intervention will fully curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear aspirations,\u201d said Paul.\nTrump is just the latest in a line of presidents to test the limits of the resolution \u2014 though he\u2019s done so at a time when he\u2019s often bristling at the nation\u2019s checks and balances.\nTrump on Monday sent a letter to Congress \u2014 as required by the War Powers Resolution \u2014 that said strikes on Iran over the weekend were \u201climited in scope and purpose\u201d and \u201cdesigned to minimize casualties, deter future attacks and limit the risk of escalation.\u201d\nBut following classified briefings with top White House officials this week, some lawmakers remain skeptical about how imminent the threat truly was.\n\u201cThere was no imminent threat to the United States,\u201d said Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, after Friday\u2019s classified briefings.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always an Iranian threat to the world. But, I have not seen anything to suggest that the threat from the Iranians was radically different last Saturday than it was two Saturdays ago,\u201d Himes said.\nDespite Democratic skepticism, nearly all Republicans applauded Trump\u2019s decision to strike Iran. And for GOP senators, supporting the resolution would have meant rebuking the president at the same time they\u2019re working to pass his major legislative package.\nKaine proposed a similar resolution in 2020 aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s authority to launch military operations against Iran. Among the eight Republicans who joined Democrats in approving the resolution was Indiana Sen. Todd Young.\nAfter Thursday\u2019s classified briefing for the Senate, Young said he was \u201cconfident that Iran was prepared to pose a significant threat\u201d and that, given Trump\u2019s stated goal of no further escalation, \u201cI do not believe this resolution is necessary at this time.\u201d\n\u201cShould the Administration\u2019s posture change or events dictate the consideration of additional American military action, Congress should be consulted so we can best support those efforts and weigh in on behalf of our constituents,\u201d Young said in a statement.\nTrump has said that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran is now in place. But he and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have verbally sparred in recent days, with the ayatollah warning the U.S. not to launch future strikes on Iran.\nWhite House officials have said they expect to restart talks soon with Iran, though nothing has been scheduled.\n___\nAssociated Press reporter Leah Askarinam contributed to this report."

Australia is investing in the U.S. submarine industrial base to help accelerate production, while bipartisan support for AUKUS remains strong despite challenges.",
