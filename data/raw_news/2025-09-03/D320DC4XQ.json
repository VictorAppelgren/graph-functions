  "title": "The World\u2019s Biggest Iceberg Is Finally Crumbling",
  "description": "Experts believe the \"megaberg\" known as A23a could vanish in a matter of weeks.",
  "content": "Just months ago, the world\u2019s largest iceberg weighed about a trillion tons and covered an area nearly the size of Anchorage, Alaska. Now it\u2019s less than half that\u2014and rapidly disappearing.\n\nIn recent weeks, massive chunks of ice measuring up to 250 square miles (400 square kilometers) have sloughed off the \u2018megaberg\u2019 known as A23a. Smaller pieces float freely in the surrounding waters too, many of them still big enough to threaten ships.\n\nThe iceberg\u2019s disintegration has reduced its total area to 683 square miles (1,770 square kilometers), according to an Agence France-Presse analysis of satellite images captured by the European Union Earth observation monitor Copernicus. It could disappear completely within weeks.\n\nAndrew Meijers, a physical oceanographer from the British Antarctic Survey, told AFP that A23a was \u201cbreaking up fairly dramatically\u201d as it drifted further north. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s very much on its way out\u2026it\u2019s basically rotting underneath,\u201d he said. \u201cThe water is way too warm for it to maintain. It\u2019s constantly melting.\u201d\n\nThis could mark the end of A23a\u2019s 40-year-long journey, which started when the iceberg broke off Antarctica\u2019s Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It remained grounded on the bottom of the Weddell Sea for more than 30 years before detaching and beginning its slow drift northward in 2020. Over the next four years, A23a followed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current on a path known as \u201cIceberg Alley\u201d and then became trapped in an ocean vortex near the South Orkney Islands in April 2024.\n\nAfter finally breaking free eight months later, the iceberg resumed its journey north. In March, it ran aground near the Southern Ocean\u2019s South Georgia Island, sparking fears that it could disrupt large colonies of penguins and seals. Fortunately, it dislodged in May, drifting around the island and northward again.\n\nAs A23a has encountered huge waves and increasingly warmer waters, it\u2019s been crumbling into the ocean. Losing half its size in a matter of months is staggering, but most icebergs never make it this far from the frigid waters of Antarctica, Meijers said. \u201cThis one\u2019s really big so it has lasted longer and gone further than others,\u201d he explained.\n\nStill, A23a is shrinking faster than new ice can form. \u201cI expect that to continue in the coming weeks, and expect it won\u2019t be really identifiable within a few weeks,\u201d Meijers said. It\u2019s unclear how much water this megaberg contained at its peak, but the similarly sized A68a dumped more than 1 trillion tons of fresh water into the ocean during its lifetime.\n\nContrary to popular belief, melting icebergs\u2014even giants like A68a and A23a\u2014don\u2019t raise global sea levels. That\u2019s because they\u2019re already floating in the ocean. However, their rapid disappearance is a clear sign of rising global temperatures, which do contribute to sea level rise by accelerating glacial melt.\n\nRecent research estimates that Antarctica\u2019s ice sheet could raise global sea levels 11 inches (28 centimeters) by 2100, and potentially more if we surpass certain warming thresholds. That said, much remains unknown about the processes that underlie accelerated sea level rise. Despite uncertainties in future projections, the disappearance of Antarctic behemoths like A23a serves as a stark reminder of how rapidly humans are reshaping this critical region.",

      "text": "Massive Iceberg on the Loose (Image of the Week)\nDetailed Description\nThe world\u2019s largest iceberg floats freely in the Southern Ocean.\nIceberg A23a is a 1,500 square mile ice mass larger than the state of Rhode Island. A23a weighs approximately 1 trillion tons and measures around 1,300 feet thick.\nA23a began its journey in August 1986, when it calved, or broke off, from Antarctica\u2019s Filchner Ice Shelf. The iceberg remained grounded on the seafloor in the Weddell Sea for the next three decades.\nIn 2020, A23a detached from the seabed and began drifting north. For the next four years, the iceberg followed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current on a path known as \u201cIceberg Alley.\u201d\nAround April 2024, though, A23a became trapped in an ocean vortex\u2014a Taylor column\u2014near the South Orkney Islands. In Taylor columns, currents flowing around underwater mountains create rotating columns of water. A23a began spinning counterclockwise about 15 degrees every day, trapped in a swirling vortex for 8 months.\nDecember 2024, A23a broke free from the Taylor Column and is drifting north in the Southern Ocean. The iceberg could collide with South Georgia, an island in the South Atlantic Ocean. Although the iceberg escaped one fate, A23a now floats toward its probable demise; if the iceberg doesn\u2019t hit South Georgia, the British Antarctic Survey predicts A23a will likely split into smaller icebergs and meet a watery grave in the warmer currents of the north.\nLandsat images help scientists study icebergs and other surface phenomena, as well as indirectly reveal geological features beneath the ocean through observations such as those of sediment plumes and changes in ocean color.\nDetails\nSources/Usage\nPublic Domain.\nMusic track licensed via EpidemicSound:\n\"Lore\" by Trevor Kowalski\nhttps://www.epidemicsound.com/track/uUSfRbwztl/\n\"Dry Ice Bubbling in Water\" (https://freesound.org/s/504930/) by unfa licensed under CC0 1.0.\n\"waves_1.wav\" (https://freesound.org/s/241824/) by haldigital97 licensed under CC0 1.0."

      "text": "After spinning in a vortex for months, the world\u2019s largest and oldest iceberg is on the move again.\nResearchers from the British Antarctic Survey announced on Friday that the colossal iceberg, designated A23a, is floating across the Southern Ocean. The iceberg\u2019s journey provides a significant opportunity for scientists to study how giant icebergs impact their surrounding ecosystems.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see A23a on the move again after periods of being stuck. We are interested to see if it will take the same route the other large icebergs that have calved off Antarctica have taken,\u201d Andrew Meijers, an oceanographer at British Antarctic Survey, noted in the British Antarctic Survey statement, \u201cAnd more importantly what impact this will have on the local ecosystem.\u201d\nA23a weighs almost a trillion tons, and, as of August, spanned 1,418-square-miles (3,672 square kilometers), making it twice as big as Greater London, or just a bit larger than Rhode Island, according to CNN. It has repeatedly claimed the title of the world\u2019s largest iceberg, outlasting several large contenders.\nA23a separated from West Antarctica\u2019s Filchner-Ronne ice shelf in 1986 as a result of natural processes, but almost immediately got lodged into the seafloor north of the South Orkney Islands. In 2020, it came free and floated in the Weddell Sea until it got trapped in a Taylor Column, a phenomenon in oceans that traps objects drifting over underwater mountains in water vortexes.\nDO YOU WANT TO BREAK FREE!?\nWell, you\u2019re not alone \u2013 Iceberg #A23a, the world\u2019s largest and oldest #iceberg, is on the move!\nLearn how it escaped \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/MQHd8TfVSL pic.twitter.com/G3J0U2KfFz\n\u2014 British Antarctic Survey \ud83d\udc27 (@BAS_News) December 13, 2024\nA23a recently escaped the rotating waters that kept it in place, according to BAS. Scientists expect the iceberg to drift along on the Antarctic Circumpolar Current towards the warmer waters around the island of South Georgia, where it will likely break up into countless smaller pieces and ultimately melt.\nOne year ago, British Antarctic Survey researchers observed A23a while studying polar ecosystems in the Weddell Sea for the BIOPOLE project. From the RRS Sir David Attenborough research vessel, they photographed the massive iceberg and collected samples from the waters in its proximity.\n\u201cWe know that these giant icebergs can provide nutrients to the waters they pass through, creating thriving ecosystems in otherwise less productive areas. What we don\u2019t know is what difference particular icebergs, their scale, and their origins can make to that process,\u201d says Laura Taylor, a biogeochemist at BIOPOLE.\n\u201cWe took samples of ocean surface waters behind, immediately adjacent to, and ahead of the iceberg\u2019s route,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey should help us determine what life could form around A23a and how it impacts carbon in the ocean and its balance with the atmosphere.\u201d\nIt remains to be seen how long A23a will remain the world\u2019s largest iceberg, and what its oceanic journey will reveal about Antarctic marine ecosystems. I have a feeling we\u2019ve only hit the tip of the literal iceberg!"

      "text": "What\u2019s white, weighs roughly one trillion metric tons, and is now heading away from the Antarctic Peninsula? If you guessed iceberg A23a, you\u2019re absolutely right, as this colossal chunk of snow and ice is finally leaving the cradle.\nIceberg A23a managed to dislodge itself from the ocean floor in November 2023, but its story actually began 37 years earlier. West Antarctica\u2019s Filchner Ice Sheet birthed the behemoth in 1986, but shortly after its emergence, iceberg A23a became grounded in the Weddell Sea, rendering it immobile. A combination of winds and currents contributed to its long-overdue jailbreak in early November of last year.\nFor the past several weeks, A23a has seemingly drifted without purpose in the Weddell Sea, but the latest satellite imagery shows the gigantic iceberg heading in a distinctly northern direction away from the Antarctic Peninsula, according to the European Space Agency. It brushed the east coast of Elephant Island and is now en route to the southern Atlantic Ocean. Video of A23a was stitched together using data on sea-ice concentration, showing its path from November 1, 2023, to January 23, 2024.\nA23a spans an area of 1,544 square miles (4,000 square kilometers) and has a thickness of approximately 919 feet (280 meters). That\u2019s a big boy\u2014large enough to pack 68 Manhattan islands within its sprawling expanse. Andrew Meijers, chief scientist aboard the RRS Sir David Attenborough polar research vessel, visited the big \u2018berg earlier this month, saying \u201cit stretches as far as the eye can see,\u201d as noted in a British Antarctic Survey press release.\nIt\u2019s difficult to predict the iceberg\u2019s journey from here. However, based on the trajectories of past icebergs, including giant icebergs A68 and A76a, it\u2019s likely to travel towards the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Once there, it\u2019s likely to be propelled into the South Atlantic, an area often referred to as \u201ciceberg alley.\u201d Once A23a enters warmer waters, it will slowly start to shed and disintegrate, a natural process that is likely to span several years. This gradual breakdown will be advantageous to the creatures living in its vicinity.\n\u201cWe know that these giant icebergs can provide nutrients to the waters they pass through, creating thriving ecosystems in otherwise less productive areas,\u201d Laura Taylor, a biogeochemist from the BIOPOLE project, said in the same BAC release. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is what difference particular icebergs, their scale, and their origins can make to that process.\u201d The BIOPOLE mission is currently making use of the RRS Sir David Attenborough, who visited iceberg A23a prior to it breaking free from the Weddell Sea.\nAs an interesting aside, the Soviet Union\u2019s Druzhnaya 1 Antarctic base was located on the Filchner ice sheet, from where scientists worked each austral summer from 1975 to 1986. When iceberg A23a sprung loose from the ice sheet in 1986, Druzhnaya 1 was still on top of it. In February 1987, the Soviets visited one last time, approaching the iceberg in a ship to collect their equipment from the abandoned base.\nFor more spaceflight in your life, follow us on X (formerly Twitter) and bookmark Gizmodo\u2019s dedicated Spaceflight page."

      "text": "In a seemingly reverse Titanic reenactment, the world\u2019s largest iceberg is heading straight for a remote British territory\u2014one teeming with sensitive wildlife.\nThe colossal iceberg A23a is on a collision path with the island of South Georgia, a British overseas territory between Antarctica and Argentina in the South Atlantic Ocean. The big berg is currently drifting just 173 miles (280 kilometers) from the island, and its path poses a potential threat to local wildlife like penguins and seals, as originally reported by BBC News.\n\u201cIcebergs are inherently dangerous. I would be extraordinarily happy if it just completely missed us,\u201d said sea captain Simon Wallace, who\u2019s on the South Georgia government vessel Pharos, according to BBC News.\nThe iceberg\u2019s journey began nearly four decades ago, when natural processes caused it to break off West Antarctica\u2019s Filchner-Ronne ice shelf. Its newfound freedom didn\u2019t last, however, as the iceberg soon became stuck to the seafloor. In 2020, it finally broke free and began floating in the Weddell Sea once more, only to face yet another obstacle worthy of Homer\u2019s Odyssey: it got trapped in a water vortex. Its subsequent great escape made headlines late last year, as we previously reported.\nA23a isn\u2019t just big, it\u2019s \u201cENORMOUS,\u201d Andrew Miller, the primary photographer for Toronto\u2019s Capture North Studios, wrote in a blog post on December 10. Miller captured remarkable drone footage of A23a, including the feature image of this article, while working on an expedition with Intrepid Travel.\nAs of August, the iceberg covered an area spanning 1,418 square miles (3,672 square kilometers), though now the warmer waters further north from Antarctica are slowly melting its 1,312-foot (400-meter) cliffs, according to the BBC. The iceberg is now \u201cjust\u201d around the size of England\u2019s Cornwall.\nA23a is not the first giant iceberg to head toward the British island and threaten the local wildlife. In 2020, iceberg A68a also made a run for the landmass, but ultimately lost steam just southeast of the island before breaking apart and disintegrating into thousands of pieces. Had A68a become stuck on the seafloor near South Georgia, it would have disrupted crucial penguin and seal feeding routes. Such is the concern now as A23a heads toward the ecologically sensitive island.\n\u201cThe iceberg [A23a] is following a very similar path [to previous large icebergs] and we\u2019ll be interested to see if it also gets caught in the same place as the previous bergs, which span in circles for several weeks before moving on,\u201d Andrew Fleming, Head of Mapping and GIS at British Antarctic Survey (BAS), said in a BAS statement from mid-January. BAS researchers are tracking A23a\u2019s path with satellite images.\nIt remains to be seen if A23a will stick to its course, how the wildlife will fare whatever the outcome, and how the icy behemoth\u2019s decades-long journey will end."

      "text": "After a leisurely five-year journey, the ginormous iceberg A23a appears to have run aground near the Southern Ocean\u2019s South Georgia Island, according to the British Antarctic Survey.\nA23a weighs nearly a trillion metric tons, making it the world\u2019s largest active iceberg. It calved from Antarctica in 1986, making it the world\u2019s oldest berg. And now, after drifting for half a decade, A23a has grounded itself about 56 miles (90 kilometers) south of South Georgia.\n\u201cIf the iceberg stays grounded, we don\u2019t expect it to significantly affect the local wildlife of South Georgia,\u201d said Andrew Meijers, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, in a survey release. \u201cIn the last few decades, the many icebergs that end up taking this route through the Southern Ocean soon break up, disperse and melt. Commercial fisheries have been disrupted in the past however, and as the berg breaks into smaller pieces, this might make fishing operations in the area both more difficult and potentially hazardous.\u201d\nA23a\u2014an iceberg a little larger than the state of Rhode Island\u2014was lodged in the seafloor for decades before it took its wanton journey up to South Georgia. The berg got caught in a water vortex that made its path more predictable, but in 2024 the berg escaped the vortex and it seemed to be on a collision course with South Georgia. Now, the object\u2019s 1,312-foot (400-meter) cliffs are resting south of the island, and may slowly melt and break up on that site.\n\u201cFrom a scientific perspective we are keen to see how the iceberg will affect the local ecosystem,\u201d Meijers added. \u201cNutrients stirred up by the grounding and from its melt may boost food availability for the whole regional ecosystem, including for charismatic penguins and seals.\u201d\nAccording to a Q&A with Meijers posted on the British Antarctic Survey site, the berg has not yet broken down into smaller chunks, as similar megabergs did in the past.\nBecause A23a is now grounded, it is more likely to break up. But the berg could yet wriggle free and continue on its northerly tack; Meijers noted that one iceberg came within 620 miles (1000 km) of Perth, Australia, because the warmer waters and air caught up with it and it finally broke up.\nFor now, A23a is quite easy to track. For one, it\u2019s a gigantic piece of ice, one easily visible to ship operators and even satellites in space. Second, the iceberg is currently stuck in one place. But when A23a begins to break up, the smaller\u2014albeit hazardous\u2014icebergs that splinter off will be much harder to track, which could jeopardize fishing operations.\nAccording to Meijers, Earth\u2019s ice shelves have lost about 6,000 billion metric tons of their mass since 2000. Anthropogenic climate change is expediting the loss of the ice shelves, which has implications for ocean circulation and sea level rise, among other factors.\nScientists are keeping a close eye on the berg\u2014as well as how the local sea creatures react to their newest neighbor."

  "argos_summary": "The world\u2019s largest iceberg, A23a, has shrunk to less than half its former size and may vanish within weeks as warmer waters melt it. Satellite imagery shows its area reduced to 683 square miles, and experts warn it will break into smaller pieces and melt in the Southern Ocean. The rapid loss signals rising global temperatures and highlights impacts on marine ecosystems and potential risks to wildlife near South Georgia. The iceberg\u2019s demise underscores the accelerating melt of Antarctic ice and its limited effect on sea\u2011level rise.",
