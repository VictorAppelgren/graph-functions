      "summary": "Plex Media Server users running versions 1.41.7.x through 1.42.0.x are urged to update immediately after the company released a patch for a serious, undisclosed vulnerability discovered via its bug‑bounty program. The fix, available in version 1.42.1.10060, has not yet been assigned a CVE ID and Plex has withheld technical details to prevent exploitation. The company’s unusual step of emailing affected customers underscores the severity, echoing past incidents such as the 2020 RCE flaw (CVE‑2020‑5741) that was actively exploited. Users should download the update from the Plex server or official download page as soon as possible.",
