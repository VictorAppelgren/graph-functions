  "title": "Stablecoins Could Cut Into US Card Swipe Fees",
  "description": "Credit cards face a threat from stablecoins, which offer a route to cheap, fast payments and could make a difference to consumers and retailers in the US who pay high fees for card transactions. Bloomberg's Paul Davies reports.  (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Make the case for why credit card companies face this threat from Stablecoins. Well, thanks for having me, Scott. So it's I mean, it's basically I'm quite skeptical about the growth of Stablecoins in general, particularly as a store, a place where you store cash, but as a payment technology. They're much more interesting just because they are fast, cheap and all the rest of it. And the thing with credit cards is they're still very high swipe fees in the U.S. compared to almost every other market. I mean, there's been Senator Richard Durbin has been campaigning against this for years already, but they still like one and a half to 3% on sort of all transactions. That's great if you really are into credit card rewards points and if you do very well at collecting them and clearing your balance quickly and and spending them well, some people really benefit from it. But a lot of people, they don't really get the benefits of the rewards. And the retailers just end up paying the transaction costs, which you don't get with Stablecoins and Stablecoins as well can offer rewards, you know, because they can't of interest on the treasuries and stuff that they hold to back their value. But there is a kind of a rewards option in there. Well, Paul, I think it could be quite a good challenge. Yeah. Talk a little bit about the buy in that you would need to see from consumers to do this, because I think consumers, when we swipe a credit card, we don't think of the interchange fee. We don't think of the transaction fee that's completely on the the retailer, the merchant where we're buying whatever good or service. So what's the buy in that you have to get from a consumer to change their behavior? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you're going to have to make this as seamless and as kind of almost unnoticeable as possible. I mean, there's a big difference between credit cards and stablecoins in the sense that you're going to have to pre-load your account to spend. Whereas, you know, a credit card, you can clear the balance at the end of the month. Credit cards also you get you can use for borrowing. But, you know, if a retailer could combine with a stablecoin issuer and a buy now pay later company, then perhaps you could kind of square off all of those things. But I mean, but ultimately, the way it's going to work is if the yields that the stablecoin issuers can make and share with the retailer is is significantly more than, you know, the costs of transaction fees and what credit card companies can offer, then maybe the rewards will be greater and maybe that's what will draw consumers in. Well, very quickly here, you cover banks. You write about banks often. How do they fit into all of this? Well, they're going to be watching this very closely. I mean, retailers can't issue their own coins. Non-financial companies can't do that. So they'll need to partner with somebody, Somebody like Circle who runs Usdc are obviously looking at this. But, you know, you can bet that banks like Jp morgan, Bank of America, the other big card companies, are going to be keeping a very close eye on developments here and try to find their own way to do so.

  "summary": "The article discusses the potential threat posed by Stablecoins, a payment technology that could disrupt credit card companies in the US. The author suggests that Stablecoin could replace high swipe fees in the U.S. as a payment system, particularly as a store where you store cash, and as a reward option, Stable coins can offer rewards. However, credit cards are still charged significantly higher than traditional credit card offers due to high transaction costs and high interest rates. Author Scott Stepp argues that consumers need to make this seamless and nearly unnoticeable to change their behavior. He suggests that partnerships with retailers like Amazon, Wal Mart, American Airlines, and other big card companies could help these efforts. Stepp also notes that banks are monitoring developments closely as they can't issue their own coins.",
  "shortSummary": "Stablecoins could reduce credit card swipe fees by up to 3% and potentially increase consumer rewards, though consumers need to adopt a more stablecoin-like payment technology.",
