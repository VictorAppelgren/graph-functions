  "description": "Apple has just released tvOS 26 developer beta 6 for Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD users, here\u2019s what to expect.",
  "content": "tvOS 26 developer beta 6 is now available, arriving for Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD users. Here\u2019s what to expect.\n\ntvOS 26 beta 6 arrives after discovery of \u2018HomeKit\u2019 removals in prior release\n\nApple TV users, your device\u2019s next big software update is coming this fall in tvOS 26.\n\nBut if you\u2019re part of Apple\u2019s developer beta program, a new version of tvOS 26 is available to install now.\n\ntvOS 26 beta 6 is likely one of the last few beta releases before next month\u2019s public launch.\n\nBecause the wide launch is drawing closer, the number of changes discovered in each new beta will almost certainly start to dwindle drastically.\n\nThis is all typical for Apple\u2019s beta software cycles. More changes and feature additions happen in early betas, while later releases focus on stability and performance\u2014thus making minimal user-facing updates.\n\nBeta 5 already started this trend, offering little in the way of changes over its predecessors.\n\nExcept, very interestingly, for the removal of \u2018HomeKit\u2019 references in favor of new \u2018Apple Home\u2019 branding.\n\nToday\u2019s beta 6 release could very well continue that trend, or it\u2019s always possible it will reverse it.\n\nIn any case, we\u2019ll keep you posted on any noteworthy additions discovered in the latest beta.\n\nHave you found anything new in tvOS 26 beta 6? Let us know in the comments.\n\u2022 AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)",

      "text": "Apple\u2019s next big iPhone update, iOS 26, will bring a Liquid Glass redesign and tons of new features. Beta testers can try out iOS 26 now, but its release date for the public is still a ways off\u2014here\u2019s when to expect its launch.\niOS 26 will launch this fall, likely in mid-September\nSo far, Apple has only confirmed that iOS 26 will arrive for all users this fall.\nBut looking at the history of software releases, we can get much more precise with our expectations.\nHere are release dates for the last three major iOS versions:\n- iOS 18: Monday, September 16, 2024\n- iOS 17: Monday, September 18, 2023\n- iOS 16: Monday, September 12, 2022\nEach of these launches happened within a week of Apple\u2019s big iPhone event.\nIn 2024, the event happened September 9, in 2023 it was September 12, and in 2022 September 7.\nThis pattern has been followed closely by Apple for years, and we shouldn\u2019t expect anything different for 2025.\nAs a result, iOS 26 is expected to launch to all users in mid-September, shortly after Apple unveils its iPhone 17 lineup earlier in the month.\nMid-September, then, will be when all users with a supported iPhone can install iOS 26 and get the new Liquid Glass redesign, big updates to Messages, Apple Music, Wallet, CarPlay, and much more.\nBut there will also be an opportunity to gain access sooner via a public beta.\nPublic beta for iOS 26 releases this month\nIf you don\u2019t want to wait until September to try out iOS 26, you won\u2019t have to.\nAs it does each year, Apple will offer a public beta version of iOS 26.\niOS 26\u2019s public beta will launch before the end of July.\nThis beta release will be available to anyone who wants it via enrollment at beta.apple.com.\nMost years, Apple ships the public beta in mid-July\u2014but that didn\u2019t happen this year. However, following this week\u2019s debut of beta 4 for developers, the iOS 26 public beta is expected to arrive any day now.\nLike all pre-release software, iOS 26\u2019s public beta will include bugs and performance issues that may or may not impact your device experience.\nApple uses the public beta process to get more data and feedback so it can eliminate as many issues in iOS 26 as possible before the full launch in the fall.\nIf you\u2019re willing to accept the risk of your iPhone not performing as reliably, the public beta is a great way to gain early access to iOS 26\u2019s new features.\nBest iPhone accessories\n- AirPods Pro 2 (now only $199, down from $249)\n- MagSafe Car Mount for iPhone\n- HomeKit smart plug 4-pack\n- 10-year AirTag battery case 2-pack\n- 100W USB-C power adapter for fast charging\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Apple is gearing up for a new investment in the smart home that\u2019s coming soon, and according to changes in the latest tvOS 26 beta, it seems part of that may be the replacing of the HomeKit brand with a fresh, unified name.\n\u2018Apple Home\u2019 looks set to be the new branding for smart home products and technology\nRumors last fall indicated 2025 would be a big year for Apple and the smart home.\nThis was expected to kick off in March with a brand new product: a smart display that\u2019s like a mix between an iPad and HomePod.\nThat product, however, was delayed indefinitely because it relied in large part on the Siri upgrades that were expected this spring but didn\u2019t arrive on time.\nApple does still have two new Home products coming this year: a new Apple TV 4K and HomePod mini 2.\nBut the smart display\u2014which may be called HomePod Touch\u2014is now slated for 2026 alongside other new Home devices.\nAhead of this flurry of new Home products\u2014likely two this fall, and at least three in 2026\u2014it seems Apple is planning to streamline branding for its smart home offerings.\nThe Verifier reported that tvOS 26 beta 5, which arrived last week, replaced references to \u2018HomeKit\u2019 in the Settings app with a new term: \u2018Apple Home.\u2019\nIt seems Apple Home will be the new, unified branding for all things smart home related.\nAnd HomeKit could, as early as next month, start using this new branding too.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Apple wants to strengthen and simplify its branding around smart home-related initiatives.\nHere\u2019s hoping the apparent phasing out of the \u2018HomeKit\u2019 term does truly bring a stronger, more focused smart home strategy to accompany Apple\u2019s forthcoming products.\nWhat do you think of Apple replacing \u2018HomeKit\u2019 with \u2018Apple Home\u2019?
