As many as 45 paid and unpaid primary interviews are taken from both the demand and supply side of the industry to make sure we land at an accurate judgement and analysis of the market.\nThis step involves the triangulation of data wherein our team analyses the interview transcripts, online survey responses and observation of on filed participants. The below mentioned chart should give a better understanding of the part 1 of the primary interview.\nPart 2: In this part of primary research the data collected via secondary research and the part 1 of the primary research is validated with the interviews from individual consultants and subject matter experts.\nConsultants are those set of people who have at least 12 years of experience and expertise within the industry whereas Subject Matter Experts are those with at least 15 years of experience behind their back within the same space. The data with the help of two main processes i.e., FGDs (Focused Group Discussions) and IDs (Individual Discussions). This gives us a 3rd party nonbiased primary view of the market scenario making it a more dependable one while collation of the data pointers.\nStep 3: Data Bank Validation\nOnce all the information is collected via primary and secondary sources, we run that information for data validation. At our intelligence centre our research heads track a lot of information related to the market which includes the quarterly reports, the daily stock prices, and other relevant information. Our data bank server gets updated every fortnight and that is how the information which we collected using our primary and secondary information is revalidated in real time.\nStep 4: QA/QC Process\nAfter all the data collection and validation our team does a final level of quality check and quality assurance to get rid of any unwanted or undesired mistakes. This might include but not limited to getting rid of the any typos, duplication of numbers or missing of any important information. The people involved in this process include technical content writers, research heads and graphics people. Once this process is completed the title gets uploader on our platform for our clients to read it.\nStep 5: Final QC/QA Process:\nThis is the last process and comes when the client has ordered the study. In this process a final QA/QC is done before the study is emailed to the client. Since we believe in giving our clients a good experience of our research studies, therefore, to make sure that we do not lack at our end in any way humanly possible we do a final round of quality check and then dispatch the study to the client."
