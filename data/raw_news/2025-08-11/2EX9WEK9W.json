  "title": "Elon Musk Says Apple Is Rigging the App Store for ChatGPT",
  "description": "The tech mogul is threatening immediate legal action, accusing the iPhone maker of an \"unequivocal antitrust violation\" designed to favor his AI rival.",
  "content": "Elon Musk has opened a fresh front in his ongoing feud with Big Tech.This time he\u2019s targeting Apple.\n\nOn Monday night, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO accused the iPhone maker of antitrust violations, claiming its App Store policies put his AI chatbot Grok, developed by xAI, at a disadvantage compared to rivals, particularly OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. \u201cApple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,\u201d Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter). \u201cxAI will take immediate legal action.\u201d\n\nMusk didn\u2019t elaborate on the legal strategy or confirm whether a lawsuit is already in motion. But his public offensive had begun earlier in the evening, as if he were building a case before a jury.\n\n\u201cHey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either \ud835\udd4f or Grok in your \u2018Must Have\u2019 section when \ud835\udd4f is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?\u201d he wrote in another post. \u201cAre you playing politics? What gives? Inquiring minds want to know.\u201d\n\nA quick check by Gizmodo found that ChatGPT is currently the No. 1 free app in the U.S. iOS App Store and the only AI chatbot featured in Apple\u2019s \u201cMust-Have Apps\u201d section.\n\nMusk sees that as evidence of bias, and he\u2019s tying it to Apple\u2019s deeper ties with OpenAI. \u201cAnd why is ChatGPT literally in every list where you have editorial control?\u201d he added in yet another post.\n\nApple and OpenAI announced a partnership in June 2024 to integrate ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs through Siri and system-wide writing tools. The deal gave OpenAI\u2019s chatbot unprecedented visibility and direct access to hundreds of millions of Apple users.\n\nMusk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 but left the company three years later after a falling-out, has since become one of its fiercest critics. His AI company, xAI, launched Grok in late 2023, branding it as an \u201cedgy\u201d alternative to mainstream chatbots. Grok is integrated directly into X, the social platform Musk acquired in 2022.\n\nThe spat with Apple adds to Musk\u2019s growing list of AI-related battles, including lawsuits, public feuds with former allies, and frequent claims that competitors are politically biased.\n\nMusk\u2019s threat marks the opening salvo in what could become a major new antitrust fight. Apple has long faced scrutiny and lawsuits from developers such as Epic Games, as well as regulators in the U.S. and Europe, who argue that its iron grip on the App Store amounts to an illegal monopoly.\n\nNow, Musk is repurposing those same arguments for the AI era. His complaint targets the core of Apple\u2019s App Store power: the ability to anoint winners and bury rivals through editorial curation and promotion. For an upstart like xAI, being sidelined while a competitor enjoys premium placement can be fatal.\n\nIn Musk\u2019s view, Apple\u2019s promotion of ChatGPT is part of a cozy, potentially anti-competitive relationship with OpenAI.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIt\u2019s Musk\u2019s classic strong arm move. He\u2019s done it before, yell loud enough, play the bully, and force your rival to the table. Now the question is whether Apple takes the bait or calls his bluff.",
