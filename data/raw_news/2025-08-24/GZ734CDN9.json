  "title": "Orezone Intercepts Further High-Grade Mineralization Below Life of Mine Pits Including 1.59 g/t Gold Over 48.00m and 1.09 g/t Gold Over 45.00m",
  "description": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orezone Gold Corporation (TSX: ORE",
  "content": "Drilling will continue in H2-2025 on multiple fronts in support of the Company\u2019s long-term goal of increasing Bombor\u00e9\u2019s current stated global resource from 5 million ounces 4 to a targeted 7 to 10 million ounces longer term. 5 This is truly an exciting prospect with the ongoing hard rock expansions positioned to increase Bombor\u00e9\u2019s overall production to 220,000-250,000 ounces per annum. 6 \u201d\n\nIn H1-2025, approximately 30,000m of exploration drilling was completed at Bombor\u00e9. We are extremely pleased with the results and success of the program to date, which includes 1) extending North Zone footwall mineralization up to 200m below the current reserve pits along an 800m strike length (including 2.55g/t Au over 23.00m and 1.14g/t Au over 29.50m ), 2) extending mineralization of the P17S high-grade sub-zone a further 300m down plunge ( 7.40g/t Au over 6.70m ) and 3) identifying multiple broad near surface strike extensions (including 2.22g/t Au over 14.00m, 1.12g/t Au over 10.00m and 0.92g/t Au over 14.35m ). 3\n\nThe results of this concentrated drilling serve to complement the ongoing wider spaced step-out drill program, which is focused on identifying new higher-grade centers of mineralization both at depth and near-surface along strike.\n\nPatrick Downey, President and CEO stated, \u201cThese latest drill results confirm the down plunge continuity of multiple higher-grade sub-zones, with mineralized traces extending beneath the current resource pits, and remaining open at depth. The targeted drilling at the North and P8P9 zones further underscores the near-term potential at Bombor\u00e9 to selectively pull higher-grade reserve pits to depth across the greater 14km long reserve defined trend. Of particular significance is the very broad sub-zone of mineralization at depth in P8P9. This zone does not appear at surface and is the broadest zone of continuous mineralization that has been intercepted at Bombor\u00e9, demonstrating significant exploration potential.\n\n1.09g/t Au over 45.00m, including 2.56g/t Au over 8.00m (BBD1370), within a broader mineralized intercept of 0.64g/t Au over 157.00m 2\n\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orezone Gold Corporation (TSX: ORE | ASX: ORE | OTCQX: ORZCF) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cOrezone\u201d) is pleased to provide additional drill results from its ongoing multi-year exploration campaign at its flagship Bombor\u00e9 Gold Mine. The latest results are from the North and P8P9 zones, targeting the down plunge continuity of higher-grade sub-zones beneath the current life of mine pits.\n\nThe ongoing drilling program continues to define and expand mineralized trends along the 3km strike length of the North Zone. Mineralization in the shear-hosted \u201cFootwall Zone\u201d is associated with rheological and chemical differences between siltstones and shales and the volcaniclastic footwall sediments. Gold grades are correlated with quartz veinlets with disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite as accessory minerals. Ore shoots are developed where north-northeast trending steep-dipping shears intersect the northeast trending and easterly dipping footwall shear. Fold hinge and stretching lineation measurements confirm the moderate north to north-northeast plunging mineralization.\n\nThe North Hill Zone, which sits east of the Footwall Zone, continues to deliver promising grades and widths with higher grades corresponding to increased extensional quartz veining. These veins occur between two steep-dipping north-northeast trending mineralized deformation zones suggesting on-going deformation has resulted in sites of dilation orthogonal to the steeper shears.\n\nThe recent drilling was successful in confirming 1) the down plunge continuity of the higher-grade North Hill sub-zone beneath the life of mine reserve pit (including intercepts of 1.59g/t Au over 48.00m and 1.97g/t Au over 16.10m), and 2) further delineating higher-grade mineralization within the west dipping footwall shear (2.01g/t Au over 14.00m). Both of these higher-grade trends remain open to depth, and will be the focus of future follow-up drilling.\n\nThe north-northeast trending P8P9 Zone is separated from the North Zone by an ephemeral drainage channel. Mineralization is defined over a 1.6km strike length with a width of 1.4km at its widest point. Discrete north-northeast higher-grade lenses occur within wide low-grade pyrite rich zones dipping steeply to the east. Similar to North Hill, zones of flatter lying extensional quartz veining are also present.\n\nMineralization intersected in holes BBD1368, BBD1369 and BBD1370 demonstrate the potential for wide zones of mineralization with no significant expression near surface. Mineralization is hosted within a granodiorite unit with abundant disseminated pyrite with above background gold levels throughout. Of note is hole BBD1370 which returned 1.09g/t Au over 45.00m, within one of the widest mineralized intercepts on the property to date of 0.64g/t Au over 157.00m8. Overall, this step-out drilling at P8P9 was successful in extending this zone of higher-grade mineralization by a further 100m down plunge.\n\n* Mineralized intervals are reported as downhole lengths. True widths of mineralization are between 75-85% of drilled lengths.\n\n1. Please see Table 1 for estimated true widths.\n\n2. Composite includes below cut-off dilution.\n\n3. The drill results were previously disclosed in the Company\u2019s press releases dated June 10, 2025 and January 26, 2025. See also Table 2.\n\n4. Refer to the Company\u2019s prospectus dated and lodged with ASIC on July 11, 2025 (the \u201cASX Prospectus\u201d), a copy of which is available on the Company\u2019s website for the Company\u2019s Mineral Resource Estimate: 27,530kt at 0.78g/t Au for 692koz Au Measured Mineral Resources, 151,735kt at 0.78g/t Au for 3,814koz Au Indicated Mineral Resources and 20,015kt at 0.95g/t Au for 610koz Inferred Mineral Resources. The Company confirms it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the Prospectus and that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the mineral resources in the Prospectus continue to apply and have not materially changed.\n\n5. This statement of the Company\u2019s goal of increasing the current stated 5 million global resource base to a targeted 7 to 10 million ounces longer term is an aspirational statement, and the Company does not yet have reasonable grounds to believe the statement can be achieved.\n\n6. Refer to the ASX Prospectus. The Company confirms it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the ASX Prospectus and that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the forecasted gold production targets in the Prospectus continue to apply and have not materially changed.\n\n7. The drill results were previously disclosed in the Company\u2019s press releases dated December, 21, 2022; March 6, 2023; December 21, 2022; and January 26, 2025, respectively. See also Table 2.\n\n8. Composite includes below cut-off dilution.\n\n9. The drill results were previously disclosed in the Company\u2019s press release dated March 6, 2023. See also Table 2.\n\n10.

Refer to footnote 6.\n\nOrezone Gold Corporation (TSX: ORE, ASX: ORE, OTCQX: ORZCF) is a West African gold producer engaged in mining, developing, and exploring its 90%-owned flagship Bombor\u00e9 Gold Mine in Burkina Faso. Construction of the stage 1 hard rock expansion is well underway, with first gold expected in Q4-2025. Combined production from the oxide and stage 1 hard rock operations is forecasted to total between 170,000 and 185,000 ounces in 2026.10 The Company is also advancing the stage 2 hard rock expansion, which is forecasted to increase annual production to between 220,000 and 250,000 ounces.11\n\nThe technical report entitled Bombor\u00e9 Phase II Expansion, Definitive Feasibility Study is available on SEDAR+ and the Company\u2019s website.\n\nFor further information please contact Orezone at +1 (778) 945 8977 or visit the Company\u2019s website at www.orezone.com.\n\nThis announcement is authorised for ASX release by Patrick Downey, President, CEO and Director.\n\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange neither approves nor disapproves the information contained in this news release.\n\nAlastair Gallaugher (CGeol), Exploration Manager for Orezone, is the Qualified Person under NI 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.\n\nInformation in this press release that relates to exploration results is based on, and fairly represents, information and supporting documentation prepared by Mr. Gallaugher, a Competent Person who is a Member of the Geological Society of London. Mr. Gallaugher has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he is undertaking to qualify as a \u2018Competent Person\u2019 as defined in the 2012 Edition of the \u2018Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves\u2019 (JORC Code). Mr. Gallaugher is an employee of the Company and consents to the inclusion in this announcement of all technical statements based on his information in the form and context in which it appears.\n\nThe mineralized intervals are based on a lower cut-off grade of 0.28g/t in the Oxide+Upper Transition zone, and 0.45g/t Au in the Lower Transition+Hard Rock zone. The half-core drilling samples were cut using a diamond saw by Orezone employees. The samples were prepared by BIGS Global Burkina s.a.r.l. (\u201cBIGS Global\u201d) and then split by Orezone to 1 kg using Rotary Sample Dividers (\u201cRSDs\u201d). A 1kg aliquot was analyzed for leachable gold at BIGS Global in Ouagadougou, by bottle-roll cyanidation using a LeachWellTM catalyst. The leach residues from all samples with a leach grade greater than or equal to 0.25g/t Au were prepared by BIGS Global and then split by Orezone to 50g using RSDs. A 50g aliquot was analyzed by fire assay at BIGS Global.\n\nOrezone employs a rigorous Quality Control Program including a minimum of 10% standards, blanks and duplicates. The composite width and grade include the final leach residue assay results for most of the drill intercepts reported.\n\nThis press release contains certain information that constitutes \u201cforward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of applicable Canadian Securities laws and \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of applicable U.S. securities laws (together, \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d).

Subject to applicable securities laws, the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this press release.\n\u2022 Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc.). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.\n\u2022 Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.\n\u2022 Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.\n\u2022 In cases where \u2018industry standard\u2019 work has been done this would be relatively simple (e.g. \u2018reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay\u2019). In other cases, more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (e.g. submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.\n\u2022 Reverse circulation (RC) drill samples are collected every metre for the entire length of the borehole. All material from each meter was sampled via conical splitter attached to the RC rig cyclone. This produces a 2-3kg sub-sample which is collected in a prelabelled sample bag with sequential sample numbers.\n\u2022 Historical RC sampling includes collecting the cyclone underflow sample, splitting in a rotary sample divider to generate a RC sub-sample with a mass of \u00b12.1 kg.\n\u2022 HQ and NQ drill core samples are collected from half-drill core cut evenly lengthwise with a diamond saw at regular 1 m intervals. Sampling per geological contacts is permitted \u00b1 0.2m either side of the meter mark. Samples are numbered and bagged before dispatch to the laboratory. Samples were consistently cut on a nominal 10 degree rotation from the orientation line mark on the core (where orientation available, otherwise a consistent cut-line is established) and the non-orientation/cut-line marked side of the core is submitted for assay.\n\u2022 Samples were submitted to BIGS Laboratory in Ouagadougou after drying, the entire sample is crushed to 6 mm and pulverised to achieve 85% passing 106 \u03bcm. The pulverised samples are returned to site and rotary split to 1 kg for use as original samples and duplicates. Samples are returned to BIGS for Au determination by 1kg LeachWELL with atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) finish.\n\u2022 Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc.) and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc.).\n\u2022 RC drilling was undertaken using a contractor owned rig with auxiliary air. 4\u201d or 4 1/2\u201d face sampling hammers are used.\n\u2022 Diamond drill core material from both surface drilling and pre-collars is collected from a combination of HQ and NQ diameter diamond drilling (collaring in HQ and change over to NQ diameter in fresh rock) obtained by wireline drilling with standard tube.\n\u2022 Core orientations were completed using Reflex Act II or ACT III RD orientation tools with the orientation line marked up at the rig side and reviewed by geologists in the core shed.\n\u2022 Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.\n\u2022 Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples.\n\u2022 Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.\n\u2022 Diamond core recoveries are measured in the core trays and recorded as recovered meters and recovered % as part of the geological logging process. RC sample recovery was qualitatively logged with weights of bulk samples recorded at the rig side.\n\u2022 Sample recovery and integrity was maximised by drilling with sufficient air pressure to maintain dry samples with holes stopped if significant water ingress. Dry, moist or wet samples are recorded in the database.\n\u2022 Examination of the RC and DD composite grade distributions suggests a slight positive bias between the RC and DD composite sample populations at grades <0.15 g/t, and a negative bias between these two populations at grades higher than 0.20 g/t. These biases are not considered critical, and no correction factors were applied.\n\u2022 Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.\n\u2022 Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc.) photography.\n\u2022 The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged.\n\u2022 Logging protocols were followed to a level of detail suitable for support of the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimate. Both RC chip samples and core samples include quantitative analysis (Niton XRF) and photographs. Core sample logging included qualitative data such as lithology, weathering intensity, competence (RQD) and discontinuities.\n\u2022 All reported drilling is logged in its entirety.\n\u2022 If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken.\n\u2022 If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc. and whether sampled wet or dry.\n\u2022 For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique.\n\u2022 Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise representivity of samples.\n\u2022 Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in-situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling.\n\u2022 Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled.\n\u2022 Core samples are collected from half-drill core cut lengthwise with a diamond saw.\n\u2022 RC samples representing a 1/8 split of each meter drilled are collected from a rig-mounted cone splitter. Drilling is discontinued if dry sample is unable to be maintained.\n\u2022 Field duplicates are collected from the RC rig splitter and inserted into the regular sample stream every 50 samples. Mineralised RC field duplicates for 2025 drilling are within 1 % of the original split. Lab-aware pulp duplicates a inserted every 25 samples for diamond core samples.\n\u2022 For both RC and DD samples, the entire sample is crushed and pulverised with >85% passing 75microns.\n\u2022 The 2-3 kg sample size is deemed appropriate given that the gold occurs as fine grained electrum.\n\u2022 The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total.\n\u2022 For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc., the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc.\n\u2022 Nature of quality control procedures adopted (e.g. standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (i.e. lack of bias) and precision have been established.\n\u2022 Reviews of the sampling, analytical, and quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols used on the RC and core programs have been completed and acceptable levels of accuracy have been achieved.\n\u2022 No geophysical tools, spectrometers, or handheld XRF instruments have been used in the reported exploration results to determine chemical composition at a semi-quantitative level of accuracy. Assaying for gold is by the LeachWELL bottle roll cyanide leach method. Gold content in the solution is determined using atomic absorption analysis. For all the samples having liquor grade >0.2 g/t Au, the tail is washed, dried and a 50 g charge is split and submitted for assaying using a conventional fire assay procedure on 50 g sub-sample.\n\u2022 The QA/QC protocol since 2011 is to submit 2% Blind Field Duplicates, 3% Blind Pulp Duplicates, 5% Lab Aware Pulp Duplicates, 2% Blind Blanks and 3% Blind Standards.\n\u2022 The laboratory inserted commercial standards and completed repeat assays. Repeat or duplicate analysis for samples shows that the precision of samples is within acceptable limits, and a review of results from both laboratory and Company inserted commercial standards indicate acceptable levels of accuracy have been established.\n\u2022 The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel.\n\u2022 The use of twinned holes.\n\u2022 The Competent Person has confirmed the sample preparation, security, analytical procedures and QA/QC undertaken are adequate for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation and that there are no factors that materially impact the reliability or accuracy of the dataset employed in the calculation.\n\u2022 Data acquisition is completed on a combination of paper log sheets, and entry into a self-validating data entry software package (LogChief). Integrated datasets have been uploaded to the Company\u2019s SQL hosted database and archived on physical back-up drives.\n\u2022 There are no twinned holes.\n\u2022 Below detection limit values (negatives) have been replaced by background values.\n\u2022 Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation.\n\u2022 Specification of the grid system used.\n\u2022 The borehole collars are spotted in the field and pegged using a differential global positioning system (DGPS) set to achieve sub-metre accuracy. Post drilling, the completed holes are surveyed by Bombor\u00e9 mine surveyors using Trimble GNSS with correction by real time kinematic (RTK) to ensure sub decimeter accuracy.\n\u2022 Grid system is based on the UTM30N grid on the WGS84 ellipsoid. Down hole surveys were undertaken by the Company using a Reflex Ez-Trac tool and Reflex OMNI Gyro with readings measured in continuous and multishot mode with readings taken between 10-30m. Holes are validated in IMDEX Hub prior to inclusion in the drillhole database. Azimuths measured using magnetic fields are converted to a geographic azimuth using the declination applicable at the time of the survey.\n\u2022 Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.\n\u2022 Whether sample compositing has been applied.\n\u2022 Data spacing is variable across the deposit, ranging from 50x50m at the periphery to 25x25m in the more densely drilled core.\n\u2022 The oxide resources have been defined along 50 m-spaced drill sections with 25 m between the drill collars. The hard rock resources have been defined generally along 50 m-spaced drill sections with 50 m between the drill collars.\n\u2022 Drill samples were composited to 1m for use in resource estimation. Mining at Bombor\u00e9 has demonstrated reasonable continuity over a strike of 10 km at a cut-off grade of 0.15 g/t Au. At this cut-off grade, the gold mineralisation forms corridors 500 m to 1,000 m in length and 10 m to 100 m in width. At a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au, the higher-grade subdomains have a strike length of up to 500 m and a width typically between 5 m and 30 m.\n\u2022 Support of the strong continuity of mineralisation along strike has been confirmed by mining production and mapping of pit walls and floors. Orientation of data in relation to geological structure\n\u2022 Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type.\n\u2022 If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material.\n\u2022 In all areas, the drilling direction is opposite to the dip and orthogonal to the average strike of the lithological units, major fabrics, and wireframed mineralised domains. The plunge of the boreholes at the collar is generally 50\u00b0 \u00b15\u00b0, thereby intersecting the lithological units, major fabric and wireframed mineralised domains at an angle between 65\u00b0 and 90\u00b0.\n\u2022 No sampling bias was deemed to have occurred.\n\u2022 The measures taken to ensure sample security.\n\u2022 Strict security measures are applied throughout the sampling, sample preparation, and analytical stages. The RC samples and the drill core retrieved by the drillers are collected and handled at the drill site by Orezone personnel. The sample bags are transported by a dedicated driver to a secure storage area in the Bombor\u00e9 Gold Project area. The sample storage area at the Bombor\u00e9 Gold Project is fenced and a watchman provides full-time security. Finally, the samples are dispatched to the analytical laboratories under the direct control of Orezone staff, who monitor the preparation and shipment of the samples. This procedure ensures reasonable chain of custody by Orezone from the drill sites to the analytical laboratory.\n\u2022 The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data.\n\u2022 In 2017, Mr Yassa collected 50 samples from 15 RC boreholes and 35 cored boreholes during the site visit for independent analysis of gold content. There was a good correlation between the independently collected verification samples analysed at SGS and the Orezone data.\n\u2022 Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings.\n\u2022 The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area.\n\u2022 The Project covers an area of 12,963 ha and consists of one Industrial Operating Permit (the Bombor\u00e9 Mining Permit) of 2,887 ha, surrounded by four Mining Exploration Permits: the Bombor\u00e9 II Exploration Permit of 1,265 ha, the Bombor\u00e9 III Exploration Permit of 3,360 ha, the Bombor\u00e9 IV Exploration Permit of 833 ha and the Bombor\u00e9 V permit of 4,618 ha.\n\u2022 The Bombor\u00e9 Mining Permit is registered in the name of Orezone Bombor\u00e9 S.A. (OBSA), a 90%-owned subsidiary of Orezone Inc. S.A.R.L, itself a 100%-owned subsidiary of Orezone Inc., which is 100% owned by Orezone. The Bombor\u00e9 Mining Permit was granted to OBSA by way of Decree No. 2016-1266/PRES/PM/MEMC/MINEFID/MEEVCC dated 30 December 2016 and is valid for an initial tenure of 10.7 years but can be extended if the mine life is extended beyond what was initially applied for.\n\u2022 All mining ventures in Burkina Faso are subject to a 10% free carried interest and a royalty on gold sold in favour of the Government of Burkina Faso, upon the award of an operating permit from the government. Exploration done by other parties\n\u2022 Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.\n\u2022 Between 1989 and 2000, mineral exploration programs were completed by La G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Mines et des Carri\u00e8res (GMC), Channel, Solomon, and Placer Dome. A total of 1,271 core, RC and rotary air blast (RAB) boreholes were completed. Channel completed 10 diamond boreholes for approximately 1,100 m, 261 RC boreholes for approximately 20,000 m, and 1,000 RAB boreholes for approximately 34,000 m.\n\u2022 Bombor\u00e9 is an orogenic gold deposit, exhibiting structural control and associated hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblages. The deposit represents a large tonnage, low-grade gold mineralisation system similar to other Birimian gold deposits, such as Kiaka in Burkina Faso, Damang, Yamfo-Selwi in Ghana, and Sadiola in Mali.\n\u2022 The geological setting is part of a northeast\u2013southwest trending greenstone belt extending for 50 km. The permit area is underlain mainly by a metasedimentary flysch-type sequence dominated by metasandstones with subordinate carbonaceous meta-pelites and polymictic metaconglomerates.\n\u2022 The Bombor\u00e9 gold deposits occur within a major north to northeast trending structure. The gold deposits were discovered by tracing gold-in-soil anomalies to bedrock by drilling. Gold mineralisation is associated with arrays of structurally controlled quartz veins and veinlets and attendant silica, sulphide, and carbonate alteration.\n\u2022 A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes:\n\n- easting and northing of the drill hole collar\n\n- elevation or RL (Reduced Level \u2013 elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar\n\n- dip and azimuth of the hole\n\n- down hole length and interception depth\n\n- hole length.\n\u2022 If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.\n\u2022 The Mineral Resource estimate includes a total of 6,322 RC drill holes and 1,426 diamond drill core holes.\n\u2022 The Competent Person has determined that the detailed information on the drill holes is not material and does not detract from the understanding of the report.\n\u2022 In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.\n\u2022 Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.\n\u2022 The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated.\n\u2022 All intersections are assayed on predominantly 1 m intervals and no top-cuts are applied to exploration results.\n\u2022 Reporting of mineralised intervals is based on a lower cut-off grade of 0.28 g/t in the Oxide+Upper Transition zone, and 0.45 g/t Au in the Lower Transition+Hard Rock zone, with a minimal width of 1.5 m and up to a maximum of 3.0 m of dilution being included.\n\u2022 These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results.\n\u2022 If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.\n\u2022 If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (e.g. \u2018down hole length, true width not known\u2019).\n\u2022 The majority of the drilling was planned to intersect mineralisation in a perpendicular manner or as close as practicable.\n\u2022 The true width of the mineralisation is approximately 75% to 85% of the drill length in the oxide zone.\n\u2022 Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.\n\u2022 Appropriate diagrams have been included for reporting of significant intercepts.\n\u2022 Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.\n\u2022 All grades, high and low, are reported accurately with \u2018from\u2019 and \u2018to\u2019 depths and \u2018hole identification\u2019 shown.\n\u2022 Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples \u2013 size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.\n\u2022 All material exploration data including metallurgical test results have been reported.\n\u2022 The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g. tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).\n\u2022 Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.\n\u2022 In 2024 Orezone designed an initial 30,000 m first pass exploration drill program, that will test multiple targets across the greater than 14 km long mineralised system. This initial program will be used to refine target priority for subsequent exploration drilling in this multi-year campaign, as well as to advance the project\u2019s evolving structural framework. Phase 1 of this initial program will be centred on the North Zone and thereafter, drilling will progressively advance towards the southern half of the mining lease.\n\u2022 First pass drilling along the Bombor\u00e9 Shear Zone (BSZ) will be focused on testing the potential of the mineralised system to depths of up to 400 m. While drilling will be wide spaced in nature, the objective will be to increase pit depths longer-term, as well as to illustrate the broad continuity of multiple higher grade plunging zones of mineralisation that are well defined by shallower drilling and current mining operations. These higher-grade plunging sub-zones may further support an underground mining scenario later in the project\u2019s mine life, once high-grade near-surface open pits are depleted.\n\nPhotos accompanying this announcement are available at:",
