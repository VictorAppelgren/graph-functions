  "title": "Celsius Stock Gaps to New Highs, But is CELH Priced to Perfection After Earnings?",
  "description": "A former level of round-number support is now in play after Q2 earnings from CELH.",
  "content": "Celsius Holdings (CELH) stock has gapped higher this morning, up more than 21% in the early minutes of the session after its latest quarterly earnings report. The energy drink company reported remarkable financial performance in the second quarter of 2025, with revenue surging 84% to $739.3 million - primarily driven by the successful integration of Alani Nu, which contributed $301.2 million to the total.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share of $0.47 significantly exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations of $0.24, and represented a 68% year-over-year increase while maintaining a strong gross margin of 51.5%.\n\u2022 Supermicro\u2019s Earnings Selloff Explained: Should You Buy SMCI Stock Now?\n\u2022 Amazon\u2019s $36M Bet on Quantum Computing: What Investors Need to Know\n\u2022 AMD Stock Slips After Q2 Earnings, But Here\u2019s Why It\u2019s a Buying Opportunity\n\u2022 Our exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nIn terms of market positioning, Celsius continues to strengthen its presence in the energy drink category, capturing 17.3% of the U.S. market share, an increase of 1.8 percentage points year-over-year. The company's international expansion strategy has shown promising results, with revenue growing 27% to $24.8 million across key markets including the UK, Ireland, France, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe company's strong quarterly performance and consistent market share gains indicate solid fundamentals and effective execution of its growth strategy, while signs of accelerating demand for functional beverages could help to drive continued momentum in both domestic and international markets.\n\nCan Celsius Stock Take Out $50 After Earnings?\n\nCELH stock is now up more than 100% year-to-date, and is looking to find a foothold above the $50 level. The shares tagged a new 52-week high of $53 right out of the gate this morning, and are moving into technically overbought territory, based on the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 71.60.\n\nNotably, the round $50 level that\u2019s now in play after earnings was previously a key area of support for CELH through late 2023 and early 2024.\n\nPlus, analysts have overwhelmingly deemed Celsius stock a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d but following today\u2019s explosive rally, CELH is now trading nearly flat with its average 12-month price target of $51.17.\n\nThis article was created with the support of automated content tools from our partners at Sigma.AI.
