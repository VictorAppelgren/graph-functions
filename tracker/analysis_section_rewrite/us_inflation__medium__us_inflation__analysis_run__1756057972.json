      "feedback": "Actionable edits to lift to world-class: reframe the piece as a tight 3–6 month scenario map with explicit timing, triggers, and invalidations linked to the cited sources; anchor the base case on concrete, cited quantities (e.g., GM’s $4B U.S. manufacturing investment and the resulting capacity to assemble >2 million vehicles per year; GM’s planned capex range of $10–12B through 2027; Cadillac’s Elevated Velocity as a premium EV signal; tariff specifics of 25% on imported passenger vehicles and parts; and Range/Pacaso metrics from UPV3X2MQ6 and V8TEZOR8R) and present 2–3 named catalysts with windows (0–8 weeks for tariff news; 2–4 quarters for GM/U.S. plant ramps; 3–5 quarters for Cadillac product cadence; cite WTNT85IPR, UPV3X2MQ6, V8TEZOR8R). Build a crisp base case, plus 1–2 alt paths (alt A: tariff escalation tightening auto demand and price pass-through; alt B: AI-enabled productivity gains via Range/Pacaso-like platforms boosting growth and dampening inflation) with explicit channel links and quantitative levers; ensure each lever has a numeric anchor (e.g., Range serves ~2,000 high‑income clients with >$6B AUM; Pacaso: 21% YoY growth in gross real estate volume, 18–19% long-run appreciation, 10 new international destinations planned; HeartSciences’ AI‑ECG market and Medicare/FDA tailwinds; 32B ECG market by 2034; 1B annual ECGs). Add a concise invalidation checklist (tariff shocks, policy reversals, credit tightening) and a watch-list with concrete barometers: GM equity/volume trajectory, Cadillac V‑Series/ Elevated Velocity cadence, tariff announcements, AI/real‑asset investment inflows (Range, Pacaso), and the healthcare AI signal (HeartSciences) per the IDs WTNT85IPR, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, V8TEZOR8R, EPJYXB7DX, and ILYC1M41F. Tighten prose to reduce hedging and present the 3–scenarios as a clear tree: base case, alt A, alt B, each with probability weights and risk flags; conclude with a single, explicit base-case thesis, 1–2 actionable alt pathways, a succinct risk matrix, and confidence level (cite the article IDs after each factual anchor).",
