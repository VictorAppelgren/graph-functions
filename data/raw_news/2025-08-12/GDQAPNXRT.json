  "description": "The U.S. government\u2019s gross national debt has surpassed $37 trillion, setting a new record. This highlights the rapid acceleration of debt on America\u2019s balance sheet and the increasing cost...",
  "content": "The national debt eclipsed $37 trillion years sooner than pre-pandemic projections. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s January 2020 projections had gross federal debt eclipsing $37 trillion after fiscal year 2030. But the debt grew faster than expected because of a multi-year COVID-19 pandemic starting in 2020 that shut down much of the U.S. economy, where the federal government borrowed heavily under then-President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden to stabilize the national economy and support a recovery.\n\nAnd now, more government spending has been approved after Trump signed into law Republicans' tax cut and spending legislation earlier this year. The law set to add $4.1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.\n\nChair and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Michael Peterson said in a statement that government borrowing puts upward pressure on interest rates, \u201cadding costs for everyone and reducing private sector investment. Within the federal budget, the debt crowds out important priorities and creates a damaging cycle of more borrowing, more interest costs, and even more borrowing.\u201d\n\nWendy Edelberg, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution said Congress has a major role in setting in motion spending and revenue policy and the result of the Republicans' tax law \"means that we\u2019re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2026, we\u2019re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2027, and it\u2019s just going to keep going.\"\n\nThe Government Accountability Office outlines some of the impacts of rising government debt on Americans \u2014 including higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages and cars, lower wages from businesses having less money available to invest, and more expensive goods and services.\n\nThe U.S. hit $34 trillion in debt in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024. \u201cWe are now adding a trillion more to the national debt every 5 months,\" Peterson said. \"That\u2019s more than twice as fast as the average rate over the last 25 years.\u201d\n\nThe Joint Economic Committee estimates at the current average daily rate of growth an increase of another trillion dollars to the debt would be reached in approximately 173 days.\n\nMaya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said in a statement that \u201chopefully this milestone is enough to wake up policymakers to the reality that we need to do something, and we need to do it quickly.\u201d",

TPDO is the sum of Debt Held by the Public and Intragovernmental (Intragov) Holdings. Some datasets include debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank (FFB). The datasets listed below only include debt issued by the Treasury Department. The list below provides information on where there are differences in debt calculations related to the national debt.\nDebt to the Penny contains TPDO, as well as a breakout of Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings. In this dataset, Intragov Holdings includes debt issued by the FFB.\nHistorical Debt Outstanding contains TPDO, but no breakout of Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings. In this dataset, TPDO includes debt issued by the FFB.\nDaily Treasury Statement (DTS) contains Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings, but does not aggregate these two categories into TPDO. In this dataset, Intragov Holdings includes debt issued by the FFB. Dollar values for Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings are rounded in millions to cohere with other data in the dataset. Please note that the published reports on the Fiscal Service site contain TPDO values.\nMonthly Treasury Statement (MTS) contains TPDO, as well as a breakout of Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings. In this dataset, Intragov Holdings includes debt issued by the FFB.\nMonthly Statement of the Public Debt (MSPD) contains TPDO, as well as a breakout of Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings. In this dataset, Intragov Holdings includes debt issued by the FFB. Dollar values are rounded in millions to cohere with other data in the dataset.\nSchedules of Federal Debt contains Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings, but does not aggregate these two categories into TPDO. In this dataset, Intragov Holdings do not include debt issued by the FFB. Dollar values are rounded in millions to cohere with other data in the dataset.\nEnd Total Public Debt Outstanding Disclaimer\nAs of February 14, 2023, Table V Short Term Cash Investments will no longer be updated and removed from the published report. The historical data will remain available within the dataset table. Income Tax Refunds Issued (Table VI) was renamed to Table V Income Tax Refunds Issued (Table V). Federal Tax Deposits (Table IV) was renamed to Inter-agency Tax Transfers (Table IV). Moving forward the Federal Tax Deposits data will be contained within Deposits and Withdrawals of Operating Cash (Table II). Federal Tax Deposits data prior to Feb. 14, 2023 will remain in Inter-agency Tax Transfers (Table IV).\nValues related to the Statutory Debt Limit are not available for periods where the debt limit has been suspended and are represented as null in the dataset. Please refer to the footnotes of the DTS Published Report for further detail.\nAs of the October 1, 2021 statement, all references to Federal Reserve Account throughout the DTS are changed to Treasury General Account (TGA). The Short-Term Cash Investments table was indefinitely suspended in 2008. For documentation of historical changes to the DTS (past announcements), including changes in line item names and reporting, please refer to the DTS Announcements file.\nIn the Operating Cash Balance table, the closing balance today column values will be null from April 18, 2022 onwards to reflect DTS updates. Please reference the TGA Closing Balance value within the Type of Account column to find the closing balance values within the opening balance columns.\nSome columns in this dataset overlap with the Monthly Statement of the Public Debt (MSPD), Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS), Historical Debt Outstanding, and Debt to the Penny datasets. Please note that Total Public Debt Outstanding may be calculated differently within different datasets. See each dataset's Notes & Known Limitations section for more details. This dataset does not explicitly state the Total Public Debt Outstanding, which is available within the actual Daily Treasury Statement. The dataset does contain Debt Held by the Public and Intragovernmental Holdings which sum to Total Public Debt Outstanding.\nTotal Public Debt Outstanding = Debt Held by the Public + Intragovernmental Holdings\nNote on Published Reports: Most copies are from the Treasury Library collection with the help from Stanford University Libraries collection and Google Books.\nFor further detail on the Government Account Series please refer to the Government Account Series Daily Activity Summary.\nhttps://api.fiscaldata.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/\n| Table Name | Endpoint |\n|---|\nhttps://api.fiscaldata.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/\n| Field Name | Display Name | Data Type | Data Table Name |\n|---|"
