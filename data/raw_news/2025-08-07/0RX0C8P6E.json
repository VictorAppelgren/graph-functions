(NYSE: NRGV) (\"Energy Vault\" or the \"Company\"), a global leader in grid-scale energy storage solutions, today announced it has entered into an exclusivity agreement for a $300 million preferred equity investment to fund the launch of Asset Vault, a fully consolidated subsidiary of Energy Vault dedicated to develop, build, own and operate energy storage assets, stand-alone or paired with generation facilities, in the most attractive energy markets globally.\n\nAs with the first two US projects now in service, Asset Vault will contract the project design, construction, commissioning and service agreements to Energy Vault, thereby leveraging internal capabilities, adding incremental cash flows and liquidity to the parent company\n\n\"The $300 million investment and the creation of Asset Vault unlock the full potential of our \"Own and Operate\" storage IPP strategy with immediate investment flexibility,\" said Robert Piconi, Chairman of the Board and CEO of Energy Vault. \"By combining long-term contracted revenues with strategic capital and integrated, self-performed project execution, we are well positioned to scale resilient, mission-critical energy infrastructure to meet the current needs driven by the penetration of renewable energy and the massive increases in energy demand driven by data center AI infrastructure.\"\n\nAsset Vault will consolidate Energy Vault\u2019s growing portfolio of contracted and operational storage projects, with 3GW and 12+ GWH of top tier projects identified, acquired and/or in operation, including:\n\u2022 \n\u2022 $100m deployed across the first two projects, offset by project financing and monetization of investment tax credits\n\u2022 Both Projects are supported by long-term offtake agreements and project-level debt financing, creating high-visibility, profitable and recurring cash flows.\n\u2022 Contracted Project: Stoney Creek BESS, the recently acquired 125 MW / 1.0 GWh in New South Wales, Australia, backed by up to a 14-year Long-Term Energy Service Agreement (LTESA) with AEMO Services as the Consumer Trustee under the New South Wales Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, ensuring stable capacity revenues.\n\u2022 Robust pipeline of ~ 3 gigawatts (GW) of battery energy storage systems (BESS) across the U.S., Europe and Australia. These projects are underpinned by long-term revenue contracts, with the US projects benefiting from Investment Tax Credit (ITC) incentives, positioning the platform for 15% + targeted levered IRRs over a 20-year asset life.\n\nCritically, Energy Vault will retain voting and operational control of Asset Vault, leveraging its fully integrated development, EPC, and asset management capabilities. By self-performing engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) for projects within the Asset Vault platform, Energy Vault expects to generate incremental consolidated revenue and high gross margins while unlocking strategic operating leverage across its value chain.\n\nWithin the initial investment of $300 million, Asset Vault is expected to generate $100 million+ in recurring annual EBITDA in the coming 3-4 years as a consolidated subsidiary, which is additive to Energy Vault\u2019s existing Energy Storage Solutions business that makes up the majority of the company\u2019s revenue today. In addition, as was the case with the first two energy assets already in service in the US in Texas and California, Energy Vault will self-perform the project design, construction, commissioning and execution of long-term service agreements (LTSA) under contracts from Asset Vault, thereby providing additional cash flow streams and liquidity to the parent company (Energy Vault Holdings).\n\nEnergy Vault\u2019s technology agnostic approach and flexible business model spans energy-as-a-service, project development and sale, and long-term asset ownership, enabling value capture across the energy storage lifecycle.\n\nIn conjunction with the close of the transaction, Energy Vault intends to host a Virtual Investor Day to provide a comprehensive overview of the Asset Vault platform, its project pipeline, financial projections, and long-term strategic vision. Additional details will be shared upon closing.\n\nEnergy Vault\u00ae develops and deploys utility-scale energy storage solutions designed to transform the world's approach to sustainable energy storage.
