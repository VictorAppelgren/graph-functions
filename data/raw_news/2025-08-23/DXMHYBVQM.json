  "title": "The Australian Outback Sustainability Solution: Art, Culture And Drones",
  "description": "In the Northern Territory, tourism sustainability is a complex balance of preserving ancient culture, harnessing modern technology, and ensuring tourists keep coming back",
  "content": "Just after sunset on a ranch outside Alice Springs, Australia, the inky blackness of the night sky drapes across the Outback.\n\nThe planets appear first \u2014 Mercury, Mars and Jupiter. And then, as if someone is turning on a light, the stars flicker to life. There's Castor and Pollux, the Southern Cross, and in the distance, a vast Milky Way.\n\n\"It is a unique spot,\" says Jacob Muller, a guide at Earth Sanctuary Star Tour.\n\nHe's not talking about the stars, although they're remarkable to anyone visiting from the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nHere, geodesic domes, an alternative to conventional angular buildings, dot the landscape. These structures exemplify energy-efficient design for heating and cooling. Earth Sanctuary is one of the Northern Territory's first carbon-neutral venues.\n\nAll across the Australian Outback, people are thinking about what it means to be sustainable \u2014 and the answer is not what you would expect. Certainly, there are plenty of green initiatives like the sanctuary's domes, ambitious recycling projects and its famous solar cities.\n\nBut out in the Australian desert, sustainability can also mean something that ensures tourists return next year. Or even something that preserves an ancient way of life.\n\nThe Australian Outback is a place of almost unbelievable extremes \u2014 blazing hot summers and below-freezing winters. The landscape is like something from a minimalist painting: Red cliffs and blue sky. It is an unforgiving environment and yet at the same time, a nurturing place where you can feel a deep connection to the land at the right moment.\n\nThat happens when you're under a starry sky in Alice Springs or when surrounded by sheer red cliffs at Watarrka National Park. Or it can happen at an art gallery as you admire the dot paintings of indigenous artists.\n\nBut to understand sustainability in Australia's red center, you have to begin with its first nations.\n\nAt the Karrke Aboriginal Cultural Experience near Kings Canyon, you learn about sustainability from Australia's Aboriginal people.\n\nPeter Abbott, the director and cultural leader, shares a tapestry of desert culture. It's a show-and-tell of Aboriginal food, jewelry, weapons and, of course, its world-famous art.\n\n\"Every dot painting tells a story,\" Abbott explains, underscoring the significance of art as a narrative medium.\n\nCentral to this cultural exchange is the concept of sustainability. For Aboriginal people, it embodies a delicate balance between preserving their traditional way of life and taking an active part in sustainable tourism. This equilibrium requires navigating the complexities of sharing ancestral knowledge while safeguarding their cultural heritage.\n\nEverything from carving a boomerang to treating a cold with traditional medicine is handed down from one generation to the next through stories. Most of these skills are not meant for outsiders. Sustainability straddles a line between respecting the culture and being part of the modern world \u2014 and it is not always an easy line to walk.\n\nFelicity Green, director of the Araluen Arts Centre in Alice Springs, says one way to promote the cultural traditions is through the arts. There are three galleries at the center in Alice Springs that are dedicated to art. The Arts Centre features important works by celebrated indigenous watercolorist Albert Namatjira. His impressionistic paintings of the Australian Outback are considered a national treasure, she says. Green has helped build a network that supports first nations artists in this region.\n\n\"I think the arts have a really, really big part to play in sustainability,\" she adds.\n\nThe arts are also front and center in Kings Canyon. At Discovery Holiday Parks, U.K. artist Bruce Munro has set up unique pieces of art called Light Towers. The display comes to life after nightfall with an array of light and sound intended to bring focus to Australia's Outback.\n\nThe sustainability theme there is obvious. As the sun sets, the towers shift color to the operatic soundscape by composer Orlando Gough. It is all meant to showcase the fragile desert landscape and its often marginalized first peoples.\n\nBut nothing draws your attention to sustainability like the rock.\n\nUluru is the Northern Territory's crown jewel. The colossal red rock emerges from the desert expanse, commanding attention with its imposing presence.\n\nPete Thunder, a tour guide with SEIT Outback Tours, says the walks around the monolith help visitors understand the importance of maintaining and protecting the area's resources.\n\nFor the local Pitjantjatjara people, Uluru transcends its physical form. It's the embodiment of a sacred space, steeped in cultural and spiritual importance.\n\n\"All the markings on the rock wall are attached to the creation story,\" Thunder explains, highlighting the deep-rooted connection between the landscape and ancestral narratives.\n\nHere, sustainability means honoring this profound sensitivity. Tourists must adhere to designated paths and are not allowed to take pictures of Uluru from certain angles because of its religious importance to the Aboriginal people.\n\nIt isn't always easy. From time to time, visitors take unauthorized photos or deface Uluru's rock art. That ramps up the tensions between tourists and the indigenous population and casts doubts on whether true balance \u2014 indeed, true sustainability \u2014 is possible.\n\nHere, too, the arts are lending a hand. A multimillion-dollar drone show for visitors staying in a nearby tourist village tells one of the Aboriginal creation stories.\n\nWintjiri Wiru is an ancient tale told through modern technology, including choreographed drones, lasers and projections that illuminate the night sky.\n\nThe story itself is fascinating, and it involves a traditional ceremony, a snubbed invitation from another tribe, and a shape-shifting evil spirit. The performance helps people understand the way first nations see the world. Nature itself has a story to tell, if you are ready to listen.\n\nThe hope is that this story will continue long after the drones have landed and the tourists have left. It is really the ultimate tourism sustainability story \u2014 and one whose ending has yet to be written.",

      "text": "Margret Campbell stands at the edge of Sydney\u2019s Harbor foreshore, her hand brushing the leaves of a seasonal wattle tree.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a plant,\u201d says Campbell, her voice steady with purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s a seasonal pharmacy in a huge supermarket and a teaching classroom. My ancestors lived sustainably here for 65,000 years. Now, Sydney is finally listening.\u201d\nSydney is \u201cdoing something special\u201d\nCampbell isn\u2019t just preserving history, she\u2019s helping write Sydney\u2019s future. As founder of Dreamtime Southern X, her Aboriginal-led tours fuse ancient land stewardship practices with the city\u2019s ambitious sustainability push.\nAnd travelers are taking note.\n\u201cSydney is doing something special,\u201d says Stephen McGillivray, chief partner marketing officer at Internova Travel Group, which recently brought U.S. travel agents to Sydney. \u201cThey\u2019re not just slapping solar panels on buildings. They\u2019re building a green economy that honors First Nations wisdom.\u201d\nThey\u2019re not just slapping solar panels on buildings. They\u2019re building a green economy that honors First Nations wisdom.\nThe numbers back him up: Sydney now ranks second in the Asia-Pacific region on the prestigious Global Destination Sustainability Index, with a score that leapt six points in a year.\nBut this isn\u2019t your typical eco-reboot. From airport runways to art galleries, Australia\u2019s glittering harbor city is quietly proving that cutting-edge climate tech works best when rooted in timeless traditions.\nA blueprint for Australian sustainability\nCampbell\u2019s tours reveal what sustainability looks like through a 65,000-year lens.\n\u201cEvery plant, every rock, flora, fauna and marine life has its story and place,\u201d she explains. \"Modern Sydney\u2019s finally remembering that.\u201d\nHer work dovetails with impressive progress:\n- Sydney Airport now spends 24 percent more on Indigenous suppliers than in 2022, part of its 2030 net-zero plan.\n- The new $344 million expansion of the Art Gallery of New South Wales has a six-star Green Star rating, using stormwater recycling and native plant roofs.\n- The City of Sydney has slashed operational emissions by 76 percent since 2006 through building electrification and implementing energy-saving circular economy policies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about going backward,\u201d says Melissa Snape of tour operator Collette, which partners with Campbell\u2019s company. \u201cIt\u2019s about using ancestral knowledge to solve modern problems.\u201d\nA concrete jungle turns green\nUnlike other sustainability leaders, Sydney's innovations aren't obvious. There are no signs advertising the city's green credentials. And Sydney is a typical big city, a little edgier than Melbourne but friendlier than Brisbane, so people aren't exactly talking about it all the time.\nYou have to look closer to find out how it's being sustainable. But the evidence is all there.\nAt Sydney Metro West, tunnel boring machines chew through sandstone while running entirely on renewable energy. As one project leader noted, \"It\u2019s engineering meets ethics.\u201d\nIn Surry Hills, boutique hotels like the one real estate consultant Sebastian Wade visited now source power from regional solar farms.\n\u201cThey even composted my breakfast scraps,\u201d he marvels.\nBut the real magic happens where tradition and innovation meet. At Midden by Mark Olive, the Indigenous restaurant inside Sydney Opera House, diners taste lemon myrtle-crusted barramundi while hearing stories of bush-tucker foraging. \u201cEvery bite teaches stewardship,\u201d says McGillivray.\nSydney\u2019s sustainability playbook reads like a tech startup\u2019s pitch deck \u2014 with a heavy First Nations influence.\nSydney's ripple effect\nThe impact of Sydney's sustainability efforts stretches far beyond the city's postcard skyline. At Voyages Indigenous Tourism, solar-powered resorts in the Outback fund health care and education for Anangu communities. Their National Indigenous Training Academy has placed over 2,500 First Nations people in tourism jobs.\nEven Australia's famous adrenaline tourism is getting a reboot. Adventurer Meeshka Brand found that Sydney\u2019s Blue Mountains trekking hubs now offer zero-waste climbing gear rentals. \u201cYou rappel down sandstone cliffs knowing your dollars protect them,\u201d she says.\nAustralia may not be the first place that comes to mind when you think of ecotourism, but the innovations happening in Sydney are affecting the entire country. And their influence is growing.\nThe road ahead for Sydney\nChallenges remain. Overtourism still strains resources, and critics argue green certifications need stricter oversight.\nCampbell is hopeful. A former schoolteacher, she says her tours are shaping how visitors see Sydney, and affecting the city's overall vision of sustainability.\n\"It's bringing awareness to these issues,\" she says.\nBut she says more needs to be done. In addition to working with tour operators and cruise ships, Campbell also offers tours to business and school groups. She teaches them the principles of the ancestors \u2014 that you can't take something from the land without putting something back \u2013 and the importance of rituals and tradition.\nIt's clear that Sydney's voyage toward sustainability is only beginning. The signs of progress are there, whether you're visiting a museum or riding the Metro.\nIn time, visitors will also discover the deeper spiritual connection that Campbell is teaching. It will no doubt come with more reflection \u2014 and with the sustainability initiatives that are starting to define Sydney as a tourism destination."
