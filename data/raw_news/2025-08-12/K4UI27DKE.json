  "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Concert \u201cStampede\u201d Injures 11\u2013Will It Be An Astroworld Repeat?",
  "description": "A crowd surge following Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s final Cowboy Carter tour stop in Atlanta, Georgia, reportedly left 11 attendees injured.",
  "content": "A crowd surge following Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s final Cowboy Carter tour stop in Atlanta, Georgia, reportedly left 11 attendees injured while leaving the Mercedes-Benz Stadium via the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA)\u2019s Vine City stop.\n\nAccording to MARTA officials, an individual screamed and ran in response to seeing an insect, which caused a stampede on the station\u2019s escalator. This rapid movement resulted in the escalator briefly speeding up and slowing down, leading to the crowd toppling over each other.\n\n\u201cOne person suffered a broken ankle, seven people were transported to the hospital with cuts and scrapes, and one person declined transport,\u201d MARTA\u2019s Senior Director of Communications, Stephany Fisher, told the media. \u201cTwo people requested medical assistance after reaching their destinations.\u201d\n\nThe inspection certificate on the escalator, manufactured by the company Schindler, reportedly reads that its expiration date is next month. In response to the event, Schindler maintained that \u201cAt this time, we have no verified information as to the cause and it would be inappropriate to speculate.\u201d\n\nWhen stampede-like events occur in large crowds, particularly at a concert or live entertainment venue, there are several parties that could potentially be implicated. This includes the event organizers, the venue, and its security team, or even the performers themselves, depending on their response to the event. Most infamously, the tragic events at Travis Scott\u2019s 2021 \u201cAstroworld\u201d concert, which led to 10 deaths and hundreds of injuries, are a prime example of this.\n\nA few months after Astroworld and its fallout, an attendee at Harry Styles\u2019 2019 concert in Los Angeles sued the venue (the Forum), its former owner (Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp), LiveNation, StubHub, and Ticketmaster for general negligence after she says she was knocked to the ground and trampled during a crowd surge. In the suit, the fan argues that organizers \u201chad a duty to but failed to provide sufficient seating, lighting, security, supervision, crowd control, or otherwise provide for the safety of concert goers [sic]\n\nCertainly, the Astroworld tragedy raised concerns and led to an increased awareness about crowd safety at concerts, potentially inspiring other seemingly retrospective suits like the one filed against the Forum two years after the alleged incident. However, fortunately for Beyonc\u00e9 and her team, these events occurred outside of the concert itself. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that a victim of injuries from this incident would have any grounds for a lawsuit against the artist or the Mercedes-Benz Stadium. On the other hand, Schindler \u2013 and perhaps the MARTA officials \u2013 could bear some responsibility for the injuries that occurred.\n\nIf an investigation finds that the escalator was not up to the proper standards despite not yet having reached its expiration date, Schindler could be sued for neglecting to adhere to safety protocol. Conversely, if any concert-goers allege that members of the MARTA police force did not appropriately attend to their needs or take action, they could potentially be held liable for negligence as well.\n\nRegardless of their location, a lack of safety measures in place by organizers at public events can put crowds at risk across the board \u2013 whether they\u2019re at the event or traveling to and from. It is crucial for venues and all related parties, including transportation services, to be aware of the crowds artists draw to their space and plan accordingly \u2013 all entities involved in live entertainment events have a responsibility to keep fans safe.\n\nCheck out my website for further insights.",

Perlstein\nA 2019 crowd surge at a Harry Styles concert has resulted in substantial injuries for at least one concertgoer, leading her to file a lawsuit against those who could be held responsible. According to Variety, the plaintiff is seeking action for general negligence against a number of defendants, including the concert\u2019s venue (the Forum), its former owner (Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp\nThe concert, in celebration of the release of Styles\u2019 album Fine Line, was sold-out with thousands of zealous fans in attendance. Documents relating to the suit claim that \u201ca large crush of fans surged toward the stage, another concert [goer] landed on plaintiff and plaintiff was crushed by other concert goers as they fell to her hands and knees causing her serious injury.\u201d Allegedly, these injuries have led to the plaintiff suffering \u201cinjury to her body and shock to her nervous system, all of which caused and continue to cause her great physical, mental and nervous pain and suffering.\u201d The plaintiff also states that these injuries have caused a severe decline in quality of life and are considered to be permanent.\nIt is not yet clear if other concertgoers were seriously injured as a result of the alleged crowd surge, or, if so, whether they plan to take legal action. Though there were no major reports of a crowd surge at the time of the concert, The Hollywood Reporter reported that several concertgoers had fainted, with Styles even stopping the show midway to address a fan who had collapsed. Styles helped direct medical attention towards the fan and asked the crowd to step back. According to the article, a staff member at the Forum confirmed that that fan, and other fans, had fainted, stating, \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few tonight.\u201d\nThis lawsuit is the first crowd surge-related suit to make national headlines since a stream of lawsuits were filed in relation to Travis Scott\u2019s notorious November 2021 \u201cAstroworld\u201d concert, where 10 people were killed and hundreds more were injured. Around 50,000 concertgoers were in attendance for Astroworld when, similar to the alleged events at Styles\u2019 concert, a group of fans rushed the stage, trampling others and preventing many from breathing. The lawsuits, including one $2 billion suit filed on behalf of 275 people, also named LiveNation in the suit in addition to that concert\u2019s venue. A congressional panel is currently investigating LiveNation and its involvement in Astroworld and, in a public letter requesting more information about their involvement, notes LiveNation\u2019s \u201clong line of other tragic events.\u201d\nWhen injuries occur as a result of a crowd surge, liability can potentially be pinned on several parties, including event performers who explicitly encourage riotous behavior. Styles reportedly attempted to help the situation, which is likely why he isn\u2019t listed in the suit. Venues, event organizers, and third-party companies, such as security services, can also be held liable for injuries sustained in crowd surges. Liability for the Forum, Madison Square Garden, LiveNation, Ticketmaster, and Stubhub depends on whether concert organizers took industry-standard precautions to prevent dangerous situations from occurring. As other concertgoers were reportedly in physical distress as a result of the surge, it is probable that culpability could be assigned to these entities. Furthermore, LiveNation\u2019s recent involvement in similar events does not bode well for the company\u2019s moves to dismiss this suit.\nWith this case coming to light two years after the alleged incident, it is fair to question whether the plaintiff in this matter is seeking to capitalize on the public\u2019s response to the Astroworld tragedy. Were the injuries sustained at the time truly as bad as the injured claims? It will be difficult to gauge until more information is unveiled. In any event, we can expect that the result of this high-profile lawsuit will have an impact on the frequency of future crowd surge-related lawsuits, and we can only hope that this will cause concert organizers to implement adequate safety protocols, including properly training security.\nEvent organizers have a responsibility to keep attendees safe. Portions of expensive tickets should be allocated to safety, security, and on the scene responsive measures. With more and more tragic events occurring at what are supposed to be fun events, heavy scrutiny will be placed on the organizers, and what they are doing in advance to ensure a safe experience. Risk managers might employ stealth, independent professionals (think marshals on planes) to make sure companies are doing everything they can to prevent future tragedies. If they do not, it is only fair for the injured to seek due process.\nLegal Entertainment has reached out to LiveNation, Stubhub, TicketMaster, the Forum, and Madison Square Garden Entertainment (previous owners of the Forum) for comment, and will update this story as necessary.\nJohn J. Perlstein has been practicing law for over 25 years, with a significant focus on personal injury litigation. He has litigated countless injury claims, including those involving complex car accidents, motorcycle accidents, trips and falls, catastrophic injuries, and premises liability."

We take the safety of the riding public seriously and are committed to working closely with MARTA, Vine City Station personnel, and local authorities to fully investigate and determine the cause of the incident. At this time, we have no verified information as to the cause and it would be inappropriate to speculate.\u201d They shared an updated statement with PEOPLE. \"As previously stated, we are aware of the incident that occurred at Vine City Station on July 15th. As reported during yesterday\u2019s MARTA Working Session, the escalator was inspected by state officials the morning following the incident and there was no indication of equipment malfunction; rather, preliminarily it appears that the escalator was overloaded beyond design capacity causing the unit to briefly accelerate and the brakes to engage as part of the unit\u2019s multi-layered, code-required safety system,\" the statement read. \"As also indicated during the Working Session, prior to the incident, the escalator has undergone standard monthly maintenance with the most recent service taking place on July 10th, less than a week before the incident. The escalator was found to be fully compliant and performing as expected at that time. Again, we extend our sympathies to the persons injured and will continue to provide technical support and cooperate fully with any further investigative efforts.\" Leave a Comment Read more: Human Interest Real People"
