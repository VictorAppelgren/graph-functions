  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None GAAP revenue rose 22.0% to $23.5 million in Q2 2025, outpacing GAAP estimates by $0.43 million.\n\u2022 None Gross margin climbed to 77.1%, leading to a raised full-year gross margin outlook of 75% to 76% for FY2025.\n\u2022 These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nNeuroPace (NASDAQ:NPCE), a medical technology company known for its brain-responsive neuromodulation device for drug-resistant epilepsy, published its second quarter results on August 12, 2025. NeuroPace reported record GAAP revenue of $23.5 million, exceeding the analyst consensus of $23.09 million (GAAP). Year-over-year GAAP revenue growth reached 22.0%, while gross margin improved to 77.1%, up from 73.4% in Q2 2024. The period also saw operating expenses rise 22.5% year-over-year and continued net losses, tempered by management\u2019s announcement of increased full-year 2025 revenue and gross margin guidance. Overall, the results highlighted solid commercial momentum, but increasing costs and one-time charges remain important to monitor.\n\nNeuroPace is a commercial-stage medical device company that developed the RNS (Responsive Neurostimulation) System, a brain-implanted device for people with drug-resistant epilepsy. The RNS System is designed to deliver targeted electrical pulses directly to the seizure source in the brain, continuously monitoring and responding to abnormal electrical activity to prevent seizures. This real-time, personalized approach makes the system a distinctive alternative to more conventional epilepsy treatments.\n\nThe company\u2019s main goal has been to broaden adoption of the RNS System, targeting adults in the United States with drug-resistant focal epilepsy\u2014a sizeable group with limited effective options. Recent efforts focus on increasing prescriber reach beyond top academic epilepsy centers, pursuing clinical studies to expand the system\u2019s use to new patient populations, and supporting commercial execution in community settings through initiatives like Project CARE. Clinical success, provider education, payer reimbursement, and regulatory progress are key drivers for the business.\n\nNeuroPace delivered GAAP revenue growth of 22% versus the prior year, reaching a new record. This sales boost was mainly credited to higher volumes of the RNS System, supported by efforts to broaden the base of active prescribers and accounts. The company reported record highs in both active prescribers and treatment centers, indicating increasing clinical adoption. RNS System revenue specifically was up 16% compared to Q2 2024, and up 21% for the first half of 2025 versus the first half of 2024.\n\nPerformance from SEEG products, which support diagnostic mapping in epilepsy but carry lower margins, remained meaningful but is set to diminish as NeuroPace begins phasing out that product line. Refocusing on its core RNS System, which generates gross margins over 78% (as stated by management in Q1 2025 earnings communications), positions the company for longer-term margin improvement. Project CARE, an initiative designed to expand access and referrals beyond major epilepsy centers, contributed to the increased implants and new prescriber activity in the period.\n\nGross margin improved to 77.1%, up 3.7 percentage points from the prior year quarter, a result of increased manufacturing efficiencies and a more profitable product mix. The higher margin profile was buoyed by stronger RNS System sales. Management raised its full-year gross margin forecast to 75\u201376% for 2025, up from 73\u201375%, based on these results, reflecting optimism about continued manufacturing and operational gains.\n\nOperating expenses (GAAP) rose sharply to $25.0 million, compared with $20.4 million in Q2 2024. This increase was attributed to higher personnel costs and one-time expenses related to severance and recruiting totaling $1.9 million, as well as $1.6 million in one-time costs associated with an executive transition. Sales and marketing costs climbed to $12.0 million, while research and development expense (GAAP) was $6.8 million, and general and administrative expenses hit $6.1 million (GAAP). Despite these rising costs, free cash flow loss improved to negative $2.3 million, compared with negative $4.0 million in Q2 2024, signaling some progress in controlling operational cash usage.\n\nThe period was notable for strong advances in clinical and regulatory initiatives, which are central to NeuroPace\u2019s efforts to expand the eligible patient base. Preliminary one-year data from the NAUTILUS study, evaluating use of the RNS System in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), met key safety benchmarks. However, it failed to achieve statistical significance for the primary effectiveness measure, marking a clinical setback. Secondary outcomes were positive, with a median 79% reduction in certain severe seizures at 12 months\u2014considerably higher than previous trial results in focal epilepsy. The company aims to submit this data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2025 for a potential new indication.\n\nNeuroPace received confirmation from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that reimbursement for RNS System procedures will remain stable under the current payment system, a detail important for broad patient access among Medicare beneficiaries. The company also continued progress on a planned submission to the FDA for pediatric epilepsy use, targeting late 2025. These milestones reflect a persistent strategic effort to expand the clinical use and reimbursement appeal of its product portfolio.\n\nThe company will begin winding down its SEEG product distribution in the fourth quarter of 2025 and continue through the first quarter of 2026. SEEG carries a lower gross margin profile of about 50%, compared to the higher gross margins realized by the RNS System, so the managed exit is expected to improve margin quality over time. The impact to revenue for 2025 is expected to be minimal as sales of existing SEEG inventory continue during the transition. NeuroPace also advanced its work on AI-powered software to enable more streamlined device management and remote monitoring, aiming to drive further physician engagement and patient management improvements.\n\nFinancially, the period included a refinancing of long-term debt, culminating in a new $75 million credit facility on more favorable terms. As of June 30, 2025, the balance of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments stood at $62.1 million, with long-term debt at $58.6 million. The company maintained a disciplined approach to operating expense increases, despite higher costs in the period.\n\nManagement raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to a range of $94\u201398 million, representing growth of 18\u201323% over FY2024, and increased its gross margin guidance to 75\u201376% for FY2025. The company maintained its prior outlook for full-year 2025 operating expenses of $92\u201395 million, which includes stock-based compensation of $11 million.\n\nInvestors and stakeholders will want to keep a close watch on the company\u2019s progress toward regulatory approvals for new patient populations, particularly the outcomes of pending FDA submissions following the NAUTILUS and pediatric studies. Continued monitoring of operating expense trends, cash usage, and the pace of RNS System adoption will also be important in determining the speed and sustainability of a move toward profitability. NPCE does not currently pay a dividend.\n\nRevenue and net income presented using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) unless otherwise noted.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
