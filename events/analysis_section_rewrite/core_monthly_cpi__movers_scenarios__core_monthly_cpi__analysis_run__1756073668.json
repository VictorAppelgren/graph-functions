      "feedback": "Up | 0–3 weeks | Tighten the CPI-to-market transmission by mapping the Citi/JP Morgan 0.25–0.30%, 0.30–0.35%, 0.35–0.40%, and >0.40% MoM core CPI bands to distinct S&P moves and policy reactions (GB4W1L6J1); What to watch: implement a crisp four-band trigger anchored by GB4W1L6J1 and validate with 22PL3Q360 auto-margin sensitivities (22PL3Q360). Probability 72%.\n\nUp | 3–6 months | Make Tariff-Stress path explicit with quantified transitions around the MoM CPI bands and EV-margin headwinds (22PL3Q360, RHFWI02JT); What to watch: tie auto-cycle margins and valuation re-ratings to these sources (22PL3Q360)(RHFWI02JT). Probability 60%.\n\nDown | 0–3 weeks | Prune non-actionable Strip/Perez narrative and reframe toward regime-relevant value-based pricing signals; What to watch: ensure alignment with core CPI anchor and Jackson Hole signals (6OOEK8TUR). Probability 30%.\n\nDown | 3–6 months | Add explicit Regime III trigger and invalidation rules (e.g., sustained core CPI >0.40% MoM or lasting negative productivity shock) with clear linkages to SGB2PAZGK and RHFWI02JT; What to watch: recalibrate base-case probabilities and price ranges to reflect regime-transition risks (SGB2PAZGK)(RHFWI02JT).
