  "title": "Trump tariffs live updates: US, EU lock in trade deal, auto tariff relief expected within weeks",
  "description": "Yahoo Finance is chronicling the latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs.",
  "content": "The US and EU on Thursday locked in a framework trade deal reached last month, which includes a 15% US tariff on most EU imports, including autos, pharmaceutical goods, semiconductors and lumber.\n\nIn a joint statement also outlined the EU's promise to remove tariffs on US industrial goods and give better access to US seafood and agricultural products.\n\nMeanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US is content with its current tariff setup with China, signaling the Trump administration wants stability ahead of the November trade truce deadline.\n\nIn a Fox News interview, Bessent said the status quo is \"working pretty well\" and called China the biggest source of tariff revenue.\n\nBessent went on to add in a further interview with CNBC he expects tariff revenues under President Trump to exceed his earlier $300 billion estimate, with the money going to pay down the federal debt rather than rebate checks for Americans.\n\n\"I've been saying that tariff revenue could be $300 billion this year. I'm going to have to revise that up substantially,\" Bessent said.\n\nIn other news, The S&P Global Ratings affirmed the US's AA+ long-term credit rating with a stable outlook on Monday, saying tariff revenues will help offset the fiscal blow from President Trump's recent tax and spending bill.\n\nThe agency's view comes despite Trump's sweeping tariffs, which have rattled markets and strained trade ties.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil submitted its formal response to a US trade investigation, rejecting the allegations while challenging the probe's legitimacy.\n\nThe investigation, launched in July under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, will examine whether Brazil's digital trade and tariff policies unfairly harm US businesses, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said.\n\nBrazil's finance minister Fernando Haddad said the country has hit an impasse with the US over tariffs, adding that resolving the dispute will depend on Washington's willingness to engage.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump unveiled \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of US trade partners (which you can see in the graphic below).\n\nThe next negotiations to watch are Canada, Mexico, and China in the coming months.\n\nRead more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\n\nHere are the latest updates as the policy reverberates around the world.",

That's above the 2.4% consensus and a rebound from the 0.5% decline in the fourth quarter. Our forecast was for an increase of 1.8%. Imports decreased 30.3% as trade normalized after the first quarter's 51.6% jump in goods purchases (in advance of the expected imposition of tariffs). Net exports of goods and services, aka the trade balance, raised 2Q GDP by 4.99 percentage points, reversing a 4.61-point drag in 1Q. Companies appear to be using the stockpiles built in 1Q. Inventories cut 3.17 points from GDP after adding 2.59 points in 1Q. Spending by consumers rose 1.4%, an improvement from the 0.5% increase in 1Q. Private investment declined 15.6%, led by a 10.3% decline in nonresidential structures. Consumer spending on goods rose 2.2%. Within goods, durables were up 3.7%, after a 3.7% decline in 1Q. Nondurables were up 1.3%. The huge services category was up 1.1% after an increase of just 0.6% in 1Q. That is a little softer than we would like. This steady category added 0.53 points of growth. Government consumption and investment rose 0.4%. The federal government was down 3.7%, with national defense up 2.2%. Nondefense was down a big 11.3%, State and local government was up 3.0%. Growth in real final sales to private domestic purchasers, which exclude net exports, inventory investment, and government spending, rose 1.2 % -- slower than 1.9% in 1Q. The GDP report also contains data on inflation, which slowed in 2Q. The PCE Price Index increased 2.1% in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.7 in the first quarter. Excluding food and energy, the index increased 2.5%, compared with an increase of 3.5% in the previous quarter. After the report, futures on the S&P 500 were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was up two basis points to 4.36%. Based on futures trading, the probability that the Fed will keep policy steady this afternoon remained at 98%. Expectations for a September cut declined slightly, to 62% from 64%.\nThe Argus Min Vol Model Portfolio\nUncertainty over President Trump's new tariff policies almost knocked stocks into a bear market earlier this year.

Based in Minneapolis, Target ended FY25 with 1,978 stores in the U.S., with a total of 248 million square feet. Target sold its in-store pharmacies to CVS in December 2015. For the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, the company had total revenues of $106.6 billion, including $31 billion from Target's own brands. Sales on Target.com represented about 19.6% of the total in FY25, up from 18.3% a year earlier and 8.8% in pre-pandemic FY20. The company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Approximately 31% of merchandise sales came from beauty and household essentials, 13% from hardlines, 16% from apparel and accessories, 14% from home products, and 25% from food.

The tariff environment is dynamic, to say the least. The White House has levied tariffs or threatened to levy tariffs, but often paused, postponed, or withdrawn pledged tariffs. Most recently, China and the U.S. agreed to reduce baseline tariffs to 10% for 90 days (30% in the U.S. reflecting a 20% fentanyl penalty). More than the tariffs themselves, the lack of a finished tariff infrastructure complicates business planning, staffing decisions, and capital investment. Within this dynamic environment, companies are focused on taking actions in areas they can control and planning proactively for a range of tariff scenarios. Companies are anticipating both direct and indirect tariff impacts. Direct impacts would include higher costs for imported finished goods and components, foregone sales as a result of reciprocal tariffs in other nations, and other factors. For example, a manufacturing company would face direct impacts as it pays higher prices for imported parts. Indirect impacts would include a slowing in business related to a broad softening in the economy. All companies likely will feel indirect impacts. A utility, for example, could begin to see a slowing in industrial and commercial kilowatt-hour sales, particularly in niches such as warehousing, trucking and rail, and other freight-related functions. We asked Argus analysts to survey their companies for their commentary on direct and indirect tariff impacts, as well as actions these companies are taking to mitigate the challenging trade environment. Nearly every company in Argus analyst coverage has issued commentary regarding tariffs, much as (five years ago) nearly every company in coverage had something to say about the then-developing COVID-19 pandemic. Below we offer a sampling of company responses to the unfolding tariff environment across a range of sectors and industries. We intend to update our survey on a regular basis at least until the tariff environment, in whatever shape or form, becomes a stable part of the U.S. economy.\nSoft global demand and tariffs in China harm business\nEstee Lauder manufactures and markets skincare, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.

      "text": "By Amy Lv and Lewis Jackson\nBEIJING (Reuters) -China's exports of rare earth magnets recovered to hit a six-month high in July, showing trade flows of the critical minerals key to electric vehicles have returned to levels seen before Beijing imposed export curbs.\nExports from the world's largest rare earth magnet supplier rose nearly 75% from June to hit the highest for a single month since January at 5,577 metric tons last month, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Wednesday.\nThe July volume, which was in line with analysts' expectations, was also 5.7% higher than 5,278 tons shipped in the same month last year.\nThe continued recovery in exports came after Beijing agreed to a series of deals with the United States and Europe to increase shipments and ease the export control imposed in April in retaliation for U.S. tariffs.\nShipments declined sharply in April and May due to lengthy approval processes for securing export licences, upending global supply chains and forcing some automakers outside China to halt some production due to a rare earths shortage.\nBy country, Germany remained the No.1 export destination with a volume of 1,116 tons, up 46% from the prior month.\nOutbound shipments to the United States last month also jumped by 75.5% from the month before to 619 tons, 4.8% higher than the same month in 2024.\nIn the first seven months of this year, China's exports of rare earth magnets totaled 27,897 tons, with the annual fall narrowing to 15% from 18.9% for the first half.\n(Reporting by Amy Lv and Lewis Jackson; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Sonali Paul)"

      "text": "President Donald Trump stunned the logistics industry on Friday by widening his steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 types of consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles and tableware.\nCustoms brokers and importers in the US were given little notice to account for the change, which went into effect Monday and did not exclude goods in transit.\nThe new tariff inclusion list was posted by US Customs and Border Protection just as many were leaving for the weekend and appeared in the Federal Register on Tuesday, creating fresh headaches for trade professionals. Official guidance has been muddled, especially for goods already on their way to the US, and it\u2019s unclear whether the metals levies stack on top of country-by-country tariffs.\nHaving weathered six months of Trump\u2019s trade war and a pandemic that triggered mass supply disruptions, it\u2019s hard to rattle the freight carriers, cargo owners and middlemen that keep cross-border commerce moving. But the scope and implementation speed of this latest notice took many by surprise.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of these 11th-hour implementations throughout 2025, this one in particular impacts every single client I have to an enormous degree,\u201d Michigan-based customs broker Shannon Bryant said in an interview.\n\u201cEarlier announcements at least had some in-transit exemptions so at least importers could make reasonable buying decisions,\u201d said Bryant, president of trade compliance advisory service, Trade IQ. \u201cThis one was unique in that way \u2014 it\u2019s very much a \u2018gotcha.\u2019\u201d\nThe new list includes auto parts, chemicals, plastics and furniture components \u2014 demonstrating the reach of Trump\u2019s authority to use sectoral tariffs. That is separate from the executive power he invoked for his so-called reciprocal tariffs.\n\u201cBasically, if it\u2019s shiny, metallic, or remotely related to steel or aluminum, it\u2019s probably on the list,\u201d Brian Baldwin, a vice president of customs in the US at logistics giant Kuehne + Nagel International AG, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just another tariff \u2014 it\u2019s a strategic shift in how steel and aluminum derivatives are regulated.\u201d\nThe White House did not comment on the sudden rollout of the expanded tariffs, but said that businesses should have anticipated inclusions, pointing out that the administration established a process that began in April for adding derivative steel items to the list of products being taxed.\n\u201cIt has been clear for many months that new products could be treated as steel and aluminum derivatives. Today\u2019s action should not come as a surprise,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.\nCompliance Costs\nThe difficulty with applying tariffs to derivative products lies in determining what percentage of an item is made from the targeted materials.\nFlexport, a digital freight forwarder, said in a blog post that \u201cfor many brands, this means chasing suppliers for detailed data: aluminum weight, percentage of customs value, and country of cast/smelt.\u201d\nThe compliance burden, Flexport said, \u201cis significant.\u201d\nThis tranche of tariffs is also particularly expansive, including items such as motorcycles, cargo handling equipment, baby booster seats, tableware and personal care products that come in metal containers or packaging.\nJason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, conservatively estimates that the metals tariffs now cover about $328 billion worth of goods, based on 2024 import data. That\u2019s six times greater than in 2018 and a big jump from the $191 billion worth of goods covered prior to the change, he said in an email to Bloomberg News.\nBroker\u2019s Plea\nBryant, whose clients include importers of power sports equipment, cosmetics and commercial cookware, sent a letter to her elected officials in Washington on Monday warning that the complexity of overlapping tariffs is becoming unworkable even for professionals. \u201cFor small importers,\u201d she wrote, \u201cit\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to think of a client that\u2019s not impacted,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cThese are American companies that employ American people that are being ambushed by their own government.\u201d\nTrump first imposed steel and aluminum tariffs in 2018 with the goal of boosting US output by making it more expensive for Americans to buy foreign material.\nBut several major suppliers including Canada, Mexico and the European Union were ultimately exempted, and US industries have said they\u2019re still struggling to compete with imports.\nBig Steel Applauds\nIn June, Trump fulfilled a campaign promise by doubling the levy on steel and aluminum to 50% and also sought feedback from industry on how to broaden it further.\nLourenco Goncalves, chief executive officer of US steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., applauded the expanded tariff list in a statement on Monday, thanking the Trump administration for \u201ctaking decisive and concrete action that will deter tariff circumvention occurring in plain sight with stainless and electrical steel derivative products.\u201d\nThere\u2019s very likely more to come. At the end of July, the Trump administration imposed a 50% duty on semi-finished copper imports valued at more than $15 billion and ordered officials to come up with a plan to slap tariffs on an array of other copper-intensive goods.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d said Pete Mento, DSV\u2019s global customs director, in a social media post on Monday. \u201cThe next list will surely be for copper and I expect that to be equally as miserable.\u201d\nReference Shelf:\nChaotic Tariff Rollout Leaves US Importers Short on Details (1)\nUS INSIGHT: Importers Still Cover Most Tariffs Despite Revisions\nWhy Trump Doubled Down on Steel and Aluminum Tariffs: QuickTake\n--With assistance from Hadriana Lowenkron.\n(Adds White House comment starting in ninth paragraph)"

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nTariffs may seem like a topic that only matters to economic policy wonks. But these import taxes affect you more than you think, even if you\u2019re not directly cutting the check.\nSince taking office in his second term, President Trump has imposed steep new tariffs on nearly all products imported into the U.S., ending decades of free trade policy and setting markets on a rocky course throughout 2025. Trump has made exceptions for certain products and set and extended dealmaking deadlines as his administration negotiates trade agreements with other countries.\n\u6b64\u5d4c\u5165\u5167\u5bb9\u7121\u6cd5\u5728\u4f60\u6240\u5728\u5730\u5340\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\nTrump says his tariffs will rebalance international trade in favor of U.S. producers and manufacturers.\nWe\u2019ll walk you through how tariffs work and what they mean for you and your wallet.\nWho really pays for tariffs?\nTrump has said that tariffs \u201care paid mostly by China,\u201d rather than by Americans. But that\u2019s not how tariffs work.\nThe company importing the goods \u2014 not the exporting company or country \u2014 directly pays the tariff. The duty is collected when the goods clear customs at the importing country\u2019s port of entry.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a [company] importing a good from another country, you\u2019re effectively buying that good in that country,\u201d said Michael Coon, an associate professor at the University of Tampa who studies international economics. \u201cSo you\u2019re paying whatever price they\u2019re charging in that country. Then it\u2019s your responsibility to get the goods into your country. If you want to get the goods into your country, then you have to pay the import tariffs.\u201d\nRead more: 5 ways to tariff-proof your finances\nSo let\u2019s say the U.S. levied a new tariff on laptops from China, and Amazon imports Chinese laptops. A broker representing Amazon would most likely pay the tax to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service when the goods enter the country.\nBut businesses almost always pass additional costs on to consumers. That means you, the customer buying the laptop, would typically end up paying the tariff, even if you don't know it. The cost would get passed down to you in the form of a higher price.\nSoon after Trump enacted tariffs on Canadian goods, Canadian energy company Irving Oil sent a letter to its customers in New England that their heating bills would reflect the increased cost.\nMany retailers and trade groups opposed Trump's original tariffs on Chinese goods, saying they\u2019d need to raise prices due to the extra cost. The Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents the U.S. footwear industry, estimated that an additional 15% tariff on imported shoes from China would increase the price of a $49.99 canvas sneaker to $60.98, while the price of a typical hunting boot would jump from $190 to $231.03.\nTariffs are often levied in hopes that consumers will substitute domestic products for foreign-made goods. However, a country imposing the tariffs may lack the infrastructure, natural resources, or cheap labor to produce comparable goods at the same cost, so buying local is often more expensive.\n\u201cEither we pay the higher price on the Chinese goods with the tariffs, or we pay the higher price to U.S. companies,\u201d Coon said.\nDo tariffs protect jobs?\nThe effect of tariffs on jobs is also hotly debated. Tariffs Trump introduced during his first term on steel and aluminum were politically popular. They prompted a few shuttered steel plants to reopen and were credited with creating several thousand jobs in the metals industry.\nBut the negative effects of tariffs can also spill over to employment. Sectors like agriculture, for example, were hard-hit by tariffs China imposed in response to U.S. tariffs during Trump's first term. For example, soybean exports dropped 63% in the first 10 months of 2018, while exports fell by 20%, according to the Congressional Research Service. The agricultural sector likely experienced some job losses as a result, some economists say. When tariffs are imposed on materials like steel and aluminum, industries that use those materials \u2014 like the manufacturing sector \u2014 face higher costs, which can negatively impact employment.\nThe jobs that are saved from tariffs often come at a high cost. The Peterson Institute for International Economics found that every job in the steel industry saved by the 2018-19 tariffs cost American consumers and businesses $900,000.\nDo tariffs affect inflation?\nTariffs can lead to higher prices, but the effect on inflation tends to be relatively minor.\n\u201cTariffs affect very specific sectors of the economy, and inflation is looking at the economy as a whole,\u201d Coon said. \u201cThe price of a few goods going up is not inflation.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s original tariffs were in effect well before shock waves from the COVID-19 pandemic caused inflation to soar. The Economic Policy Institute estimated in January 2022 \u2014 a time when inflation was still skyrocketing \u2014 that removing the tariffs would have offset no more than 7.2% of the run-up in consumer prices.\nRead more: What is inflation, and how does it affect you?\nWhat Trump is doing and promising in his second term\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump\u2019s platform included a call to \u201cstop outsourcing and turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower,\u201d and provide large tax cuts for American workers. Trump suggested that tax cuts could be funded by a 60% increase in tariffs on Chinese goods and a 10% hike on other trade partners. In a meeting with congressional Republicans, he even reportedly suggested eliminating the income tax and replacing it with higher tariffs.\nOnce in office, Trump moved quickly on tariffs but at more tempered levels. Weeks into his new term, he announced tariffs to take effect beginning Feb. 4 \u2014 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on imports from China. Duties on oil imports from Canada would be lower at 10%.\nBut hours before the Canada and Mexico tariffs were set to take effect, Trump spoke to leaders of both countries and agreed to a one-month pause in exchange for pledges to enhance security at the southern and northern borders. Trump has cited the inflow of illegal drugs as part of his justification for imposing steep tariffs on longtime allies and trading partners.\nAs the March 4 deadline approached, Trump declared there was \"no room left\" to negotiate. At 12:01 a.m., the additional 10% levy on Chinese goods, as well as the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, went into effect. All three countries quickly responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own.\nBut the biggest bombshell was Trump's April 2 announcement of reciprocal tariffs, which are meant to make up for the tariffs and other barriers that countries impose on U.S. goods.\n\u201cReciprocal, that means they do it to us, we do it to them,\u201d Trump said in his announcement.\nTrump called for a universal 10% tariff on countries around the world, plus reciprocal tariffs of up to nearly 50% on dozens of trading partners. Canada and Mexico, two of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners, were not affected by the new measures. But they remain subject to tariffs of up to 25% with some products exempted. Chinese goods face a 30% levy.\nWhile exempting some products from tariffs, Trump has also singled out others for high duties including copper and pharmaceuticals.\nTrump ultimately imposed a 90-day pause on the sweeping duties to hammer out further deals and calm markets. As that July deadline approached, he pushed it out another month. Only July 8 and 9, he released nearly two dozen letters to trade partners, including a threat of a 50% tariff on Brazil.\nTariff FAQs\nWhat is a simple definition of a tariff?\nA tariff is a tax levied on goods imported from a foreign country that\u2019s often used to protect domestic industries and jobs.\nWhat are the different types of tariffs?\nThere are several different types of tariffs, but the most common are ad valorem and specific tariffs. An ad valorem tariff is a tax that\u2019s levied as a percentage of the imported product\u2019s value. The 25% tariff imposed on steel in 2018, along with many imported Chinese goods, is an example of an ad valorem tariff. A specific tariff is a flat tax charged on each imported good (e.g., $1,000 per vehicle or $50 per mobile device).\nWhy and how are tariffs used?\nHere are a few key reasons countries impose tariffs:\nProtecting local jobs and industries: For developed nations, tariffs \u2014 also known as customs duties or import duties \u2014 tend to be protectionist. That is, they\u2019re intended to give a price advantage to domestic goods, shielding a country\u2019s businesses and workers from cheaper foreign competition. The idea is that if foreign materials and products are more expensive, you\u2019ll buy more domestic goods. For example, Congress passed a sweeping range of tariff hikes, some as high as 60%, after the stock market crash of 1929 under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act to protect the farming industry.\nRevenue generation: Like any other taxes, tariffs also provide income for the government that levies them. In fact, tariffs were the primary source of revenue for the U.S. government during its early days until the federal income tax was established in the early 20th century. Today, tariffs are a minuscule source of income for many developed countries. Poorer countries often have far higher tariff rates than wealthier countries because their governments depend on them for revenue.\nNational security: A government may implement tariffs to avoid relying too heavily on different countries for goods deemed critical to security, like military supplies. Trump cited national security concerns when he hiked tariffs on steel and aluminum because both are used for weaponry and military equipment. Though Congress is typically tasked with levying tariffs and taxes, the president has the authority to enact them unilaterally in the name of defense.\nInfluence other countries\u2019 practices: The World Trade Organization (WTO) largely supports free trade policies, but it allows countries to enact trade barriers like tariffs in response to human rights concerns.\nTariffs can also be used to discourage certain trade practices like \u201cdumping,\u201d which is when companies export products to another country and sell them at artificially low prices to gain a competitive advantage. Former President Joe Biden, who kept most of Trump's early tariffs in place, accused China of dumping practices when he introduced new tariffs on about $18 billion worth of Chinese goods \u2014 including a 100% increase on electric vehicles (EVs) and a 50% increase on semiconductors. Biden said in an interview with Yahoo Finance in 2024 that China was \u201cnot making any money off them. They\u2019re doing it to put other people out of business.\u201d\nRetaliation: Sometimes, when one country imposes a tariff on another country's goods, the exporting country responds with retaliatory tariffs of its own. The Smoot-Hawley Act sparked a trade war as European nations passed retaliatory tariffs, and historians often blame the Smoot-Hawley tariffs for prolonging the Great Depression.\nMore recently, the U.S. tariffs Trump levied on Chinese goods were met with retaliatory tariffs. In April 2018, the Chinese government introduced tariffs of 15% and 25% on 94 food and agricultural products from the U.S. Meanwhile, China dropped its average tariff rate on imported goods from other countries between early 2018 and 2022. In the current unfolding trade war, Mexico and Canada have both vowed retaliatory tariffs, while China has appealed to the WTO."

      "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the US is satisfied with the current tariff set up with China, a signal the Trump administration is looking to maintain calm with its economic rival before a trade truce expires in November.\nWhen asked in a Fox News interview when progress in negotiations would be seen and if the US needed a trade agreement because of how tariffs were going, Bessent said that \u201cwe\u2019re very happy\u201d with the situation with China. \u201cI think right now the status quo is working pretty well,\u201d he said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nWhy New York City Has a Fleet of New EVs From a Dead Carmaker\n-\nChicago Schools Seeks $1 Billion of Short-Term Debt as Cash Gone\n-\nTrump Takes Second Swing at Cutting Housing Assistance for Immigrants\n-\nA Photographer\u2019s Pipe Dream: Capturing New York\u2019s Vast Water System\n-\nA London Apartment Tower With Echoes of Victorian Rail and Ancient Rome\n\u201cChina is the biggest revenue line in the tariff income \u2014 so if it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d he said in the interview on Tuesday. \u201cWe have had very good talks with China. I imagine we\u2019ll be seeing them again before November.\u201d\nBessent\u2019s remarks indicate that an easing of tensions between the two sides remains in place, potentially creating an opening for President Donald Trump to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\nThe Trump administration has generally dialed down its confrontational tone with Beijing recently to get a summit with Xi and a trade deal. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said a meeting between the two leaders is likely, though no date has been set.\nLast week, Trump extended a pause on higher tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days into early November, a move that stabilized trade ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nThat was possible because the US and China agreed to reduce tit-for-tat tariff hikes and ease export restrictions on rare earth magnets and certain technologies. S&P Global Ratings has said revenues from Trump\u2019s tariffs would help soften the blow to the US\u2019s fiscal health from the president\u2019s tax cuts, enabling it to maintain its current credit grade.\nStill, the trade dispute with China is causing some pain for the US. Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association, said in a letter to Trump dated Tuesday that American soybean farmers are near a \u201ctrade and financial precipice\u201d and cannot survive a prolonged dispute.\nTrump said last week that he hoped China would massively step up its purchases of American soybeans. China hasn\u2019t bought a single cargo of soybeans from the next harvest, which starts in September."

      "text": "The Trump tariffs present something of a mystery. Trump's new import taxes raise the cost of many imported products by nearly 20%, on average. Yet price changes at the wholesale and retail level are nowhere near that magnitude. The higher cost of tariffs appears to be hiding deep inside global supply chains.\nOne new clue helps explain why Trump's new consumption taxes aren't fully hitting consumers just yet. Analysis by Capital Economics finds that the actual tariff rate paid on imports in June was just 9%. At the time, analysts estimated the average tariff rate to be around 15%. It turned out to be lower in reality because many US importers shifted their mix and source of imports to minimize the cost of the tariffs.\nResearch outfits such as the Yale Budget Lab, along with many private firms, have been trying to estimate average tariff rates at every step of Trump's convoluted trade war. That data helps economists estimate the effect of tariffs on the economy, while investors try to suss out which firms and sectors will be helped or hurt by the new taxes.\nEstimates of the average tariff rate have changed many times during the past six months as Trump has threatened new tariffs, imposed some, delayed others, announced trade agreements, and changed his mind. The average tariff was about 2.5% when Trump took office. It went as high as 28% in April and May, according to the Yale Budget Lab. Since then, it has dropped to around 19%.\nBut those estimates rely on assumptions about what US firms will continue to import and from where. The actual June data shows that US importers were craftier than expected. \"The composition of imports has shifted compared to 2024, with a higher proportion coming from countries with relatively low tariff rates,\" Capital Economics found.\nThe June data, for instance, shows that fewer imports came from China, which faced a 40% tariff rate. More imports came from Vietnam, Taiwan, and India, which faced lower rates at the time. That pushed the actual tariff rate lower than if import shares by country had stayed the same.\nUS businesses also shifted the kind of stuff they brought into the country. Imports of steel and aluminum \u2014 generally subject to a new 25% tariff \u2014 fell as a portion of all imported products. But there was an increase in electronics exempt from tariffs.\nA third factor keeping the tariff rate fairly low was more \"compliant\" trade with Canada and Mexico than expected. That means there was more trade in goods that meet domestic-content requirements and are therefore exempt from the new Trump tariffs.\nThe June trend probably reflects the delayed onset of tariff inflation, rather than the total avoidance of it. Importers have been ducking and weaving as circumstances allow, but they can't do that forever. They can stock inventories with cheaper low-tariff goods while running down stockpiles of costlier high-tariff goods \u2014 for a while. But at some point, demand will require them to replenish all inventories, regardless of the tariffs.\nPlus, Trump is wise to the transshipment of goods from a high-tariff country to the US via a low-tariff country, and some of his trade rules specifically target that. Imports from Vietnam, for instance, face a 20% tariff, but it's 40% if those products really come from China or some other country and just make a stop in Vietnam on their way to the US.\nEven with lower-than-expected tariff rates \u2014 for now \u2014 tariff inflation is beginning to materialize. Monthly tariff revenue collected by the government has jumped from about $8 billion per month before Trump to about $30 billion now. That tax revenue comes from US businesses that have to pay the tariffs when they take possession of imported goods. It's real money that real Americans are forking over.\nWholesale prices in July jumped by the most in three years, confirming that importers are now paying more for goods. During the second quarter earnings season, dozens of big companies, including Apple (AAPL), Ford (F), General Motors (GM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), and Procter & Gamble (PG), said tariffs are denting profit margins.\nCiti estimates that, for now, companies are absorbing most of the cost of tariffs through lower margins and supply chain workarounds. But the pain will eventually flow through to consumers.\n\"US firms appear to be absorbing 60%-70% of the tariffs,\" Citi researchers said in an August 20 analysis. \"However, we doubt that this will prove sustainable. We expect that firms will increasingly seek to pass the tariffs through to their foreign suppliers and US customers.\"\nTrump's trade deals will eventually yield a much clearer picture. The past several months have been a hodgepodge of on-and-off tariffs that have dramatically distorted trade flows. But a year from now, say, there will likely be across-the-board tariffs on most imports that range from 15% to 40%, plus product-specific tariffs on certain product categories that leave nowhere to hide. If you haven't noticed tariff inflation yet, you will soon.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Bluesky and X: @rickjnewman."

LLC, one of the largest makers of copper wire and cable in the US, and Cerro Wire LLC, a wiremaker owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., in recent days announced price increases of 5% across a range of copper wire products, according to a Bloomberg calculation based on their published price sheets.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nWhy New York City Has a Fleet of New EVs From a Dead Carmaker\n-\nChicago Schools Seeks $1 Billion of Short-Term Debt as Cash Gone\n-\nA Photographer\u2019s Pipe Dream: Capturing New York\u2019s Vast Water System\n-\nTrump Takes Second Swing at Cutting Housing Assistance for Immigrants\n-\nA London Apartment Tower With Echoes of Victorian Rail and Ancient Rome\nThe move shows how a small group of low-profile companies that own US copper-processing plants are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of Trump\u2019s shock tariff reprieve.\nThe president\u2019s decision to apply his 50% import tariff only to manufactured goods containing copper such as wires and cables, and not to unprocessed refined copper as widely expected, means companies like Southwire and Cerrowire will now be paying much less than they feared for the metal they purchase. At the same time, the import tariff on copper-containing goods raises costs for their international competitors shipping products to the US.\nAnd until the US builds more copper processing plants, the added cost on the hundreds of thousands of tons of copper-containing goods it imports each year is likely to be inflationary for US consumers despite a sharp drop in domestic prices for copper itself, analysts say.\n\u201cWhile wire and cable prices are influenced by copper prices, they are not the same. The margin between the two can widen if local producers have more pricing power,\u201d said Aisling Hubert, senior wire and cable analyst at consultancy CRU Group. The tariff means that US producers will have the upper hand in price negotiations with their customers, she said.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the price increases were a direct response to the tariff decision, and it\u2019s likely to take some time before the full effects on the market are clear.\nDomestic prices for copper wire and cable \u2014 used in almost every building, electronic device, and power utility \u2014 had already risen sharply before Trump\u2019s decision, according to US government data. An index of prices that forms part of the calculation of producer price inflation hit a record high in July, up 12% from a year earlier."

That led to the country sharply cutting down on its purchases.\nAs of last week, China\u2019s state-owned and large private refiners had purchased around 13 cargoes of western Russian crude for October delivery and at least two cargoes for November, said Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at Kpler, which tracks commodities and shipping data.\nThe 15 cargoes of oil, each typically ranging from 700,000 to 1 million barrels, will be loaded from Russia\u2019s Arctic and Black Sea ports \u2013 supplies that usually go to India instead of China, given its distance, Xu said.\nReuters reported earlier this week that China had secured 15 Russian cargoes for the same period, citing analysts.\nXu said the buying reflected an \u201copportunistic\u201d move, with the price of Russian oil remaining at least $3 per barrel cheaper than Middle Eastern alternatives.\n\u201cAs for whether China will continue buying, I personally believe that right now is still a very good opportunity, because over in India, Trump is still pressing hard on them,\u201d she said.\nOn Friday, following his landmark meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump told Fox News that he was not immediately considering retaliatory tariffs on China over its purchase of Russian oil, but suggested he may do so \u201cin two weeks or three weeks.\u201d\n\u201cTaking advantage of this opportunity while prices are low, I think more refineries will probably consider buying more, within a week or two,\u201d Xu said, referring to Chinese refiners.\nLast year, India imported $53 billion worth of petroleum and crude oils from Russia, according to data aggregated by the United Nations. Before the recent cuts, Russian supplies accounted for 36% of Indian market, making the country its largest source of crude, according to Vortexa, an energy data firm."

      "text": "By Andrea Shalal\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects a big jump in revenues from sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, and said the money would be used first to start paying down the federal debt, not to give rebate checks to Americans.\nBessent, speaking in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" said he expected to substantially revise upward his earlier estimate of $300 billion in revenues from the tariffs, but declined to be more specific.\nBessent said he had not spoken with Trump about the idea of using funds from the tariffs to create a dividend for Americans, but stressed that both of them were \"laser-focused\" on paying down the debt.\n\"I've been saying that tariff revenue could be $300 billion this year. I'm going to have to revise that up substantially,\" Bessent said. \"We're going to bring down the deficit to GDP. We'll start paying down the debt, and then at that point that can be used as an offset to the American people.\"\nThe U.S. economy could return to the \"good, low-inflationary growth\" of the 1990s, Bessent said, but he blamed higher interest rates for problems plaguing some pockets of the economy, singling out housing and lower-income households with high credit card debt.\nA cut in the Federal Reserve's key interest rate - which Trump has continually pressed for - could help facilitate a boom or pickup in home building, which would help keep prices down in one to two years, he said.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday reported a small increase in groundbreaking for single-family homes and permits for future construction in July, even as high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty continued to hamper home purchases.\nTrump's wide-ranging import tariffs have kept the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates this year, with most central bank policymakers wary of easing borrowing costs until they have more confidence the levies will not rekindle inflation, which has yet to return to the Fed's 2% target.\nRecent indications of softening in the job market, however, have largely convinced investors that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point when it meets in mid-September. That expectation has helped bring down mortgage rates in recent weeks.\nBessent has previously said a 50-basis-point cut in rates was warranted.\n(Reporting by Andrea ShalalEditing by Mark Potter and Leslie Adler)"

Shipments are for loading in September and October, they added.\nEarlier this month, state refiners paused buying of Urals after President Donald Trump singled out India\u2019s role in the Russian oil trade, threatening economic penalties. New Delhi asked processors in late July to draw up plans to pivot away from the OPEC+ producer in the scenario where flows were stopped.\nWhite House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro wrote in a Financial Times column this week that the surge in Russian imports was driven by \u201cprofiteering by India\u2019s Big Oil lobby\u201d and not domestic needs. Separately, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed some of the \u201crichest families in India\u201d were benefiting from buying Moscow\u2019s oil, and reiterated plans to boost tariffs on New Delhi.\nTrump has threatened to raise the levies on all Indian imports to the US to 50% on Aug. 27, half of which would be due to purchases of Russian oil. India\u2019s government has stated that its crude imports are based on market factors and that it will take all necessary actions to protect national interests.\nThe souring of relations between India and the US has pushed New Delhi closer to Moscow and Beijing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently hailed Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \u201cfriend,\u201d and he has plans to visit China later this month \u2014 his first trip to the country in seven years.\nMeanwhile, the discount for Urals \u2014 Russia\u2019s flagship crude that\u2019s shipped from its western ports \u2014 has deepened to $2.50 a barrel to Dated Brent, up from $1 in July, according to traders. That\u2019s likely provided added incentive for India\u2019s oil refiners to return to buying the grade, they added.\nSpokespersons from IOC and BPCL didn\u2019t immediately reply to emails seeking comment on the recent purchases of Urals.\n--With assistance from Yongchang Chin."

      "text": "(Bloomberg) -- South Korea\u2019s early exports data showed exports held up in August so far, powered by a surge in semiconductor shipments that helped offset pressure from sweeping US tariffs.\nThe value of shipments increased 7.6% from a year earlier in the first 20 days of August, according to data released Thursday by the customs office. That compared with a 5.8% increase in the full month of July. Imports edged up 0.4%, resulting in a trade surplus of $833 million. Working-day adjusted exports also climbed 7.6% for the first 20 days of the month.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nWhy New York City Has a Fleet of New EVs From a Dead Carmaker\n-\nTrump Takes Second Swing at Cutting Housing Assistance for Immigrants\n-\nChicago Schools Seeks $1 Billion of Short-Term Debt as Cash Gone\n-\nNeom\u2019s Desert Ski Resort Strains Saudi Prince\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Plan\n\u201cExports through the first 20 days of August came in stronger than expected, driven by a surge in semiconductor shipments,\u201d said Bloomberg economist Hyosung Kwon. \u201cStrong global demand for AI-related computer chips lifted overall exports, while car shipments also jumped \u2014 probably supported by an expected decrease in US tariffs on Korean cars to 15%.\u201d\nThe latest data come after a last-minute trade deal that capped US tariffs on imports of Korean goods at 15% \u2014 a higher rate than the 10% implemented from April, but below the 25% level that President Donald Trump had threatened to impose.\nManufacturers, including Samsung Electronics Co., have benefited from Trump\u2019s decision to put smartphones, laptops and other consumer technology products on an exclusion list. Supply-chain relationships with companies such as Apple Inc. have also helped.\nSouth Korea\u2019s shipments of semiconductors increased almost 30% from a year earlier in the first 20 days of August, the customs office data showed, with such devices accounting for nearly 25% of total exports. Meanwhile, auto exports climbed 22% during the same period.\nStill, exports face risks ahead. The front-loading impact is expected to fade now that a trade deal has been reached, and Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs on semiconductors this month.\nAuto exports also face uncertainty, as the 25% US tariff on Korean cars remains in place until Trump signs an executive order to align it with the 15% universal rate. Written documentation on the trade deals agreed to with Japan and South Korea is \u201cweeks away,\u201d US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday in an interview with CNBC. Trump has also threatened to add chip tariffs by the end of August."
