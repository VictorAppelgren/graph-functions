  "title": "How Boeing is quietly betting on a 'brilliant' 39-year old engineer\u2014and setting the stage for a turnaround",
  "description": "Brian Yutko wowed his peers at MIT and his colleagues at flying-taxi startup Wisk. But can he rebuild engineering excellence at Boeing?",
  "content": "As an aeronautics grad student at MIT in the 2010s, Brian Yutko was obsessed. He\u2019d work deep into the night mining \u201cblack box\u201d data and destination codes buried in antiquated computer languages like Fortran for obscure flight stats. He wowed his thesis advisor with his work on fuel efficiency. Among Yutko\u2019s findings: Airlines could reduce pollution by 7% by flying planes at slightly slower speeds, and by 33% by mothballing old models sooner. But Yutko didn\u2019t just study planes\u2014he loved flying them. Yutko, his advisor, and fellow PhD students relished zipping up and down the East Coast on rented Cessna 170s that they would take turns piloting to conferences and blithe sojourns for picnic lunches in the country.\n\nFast-forward a decade and suddenly Yutko has a much bigger fleet at his disposal. In May Boeing named Yutko, 39, chief of commercial airplanes product development, the arm tasked with incorporating engineering advances that improve today\u2019s models, and taking a leading role in designing and bringing to market all-new aircraft at Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA), the company\u2019s largest division. With this year\u2019s revenues clocking at an annualized rate of around $45 billion, if measured on its own, that unit would rank around 100th on the Fortune 500.\n\nThough Boeing\u2019s litany of safety concerns and union turmoil have dominated the headlines for several years, behind the scenes there are glimmers that things are changing one year into new CEO Kelly Ortberg\u2019s tenure. Ortberg secured a hard-won contract with the machinists\u2019 union following a 54-day strike; reached a deal with the DOJ to avoid criminal prosecution for the crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 passengers and crew; won a contract initially valued at $20 billion over Lockheed to develop the Air Force\u2019s next-gen fighter jet; and worked closely alongside the FAA to gradually raise production of the 737 Max, the bestseller whose production the regulator severely constrained since the notorious door-plug blowout over Portland early last year. He also avoided big risks by raising $21 billion in fresh capital, ensuring that Boeing harbored the cash reserves for weathering the tough times. But it\u2019s the appointment of Yutko, though it has gone largely unnoticed, that may speak eloquently about where Boeing is headed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m biased, but my take is that Brian\u2019s appointment is a real indication that Boeing is returning to prioritizing engineering and product innovation,\u201d R. John Hansman, Yutko\u2019s PhD advisor and director of the MIT International Center for Air Transportation, told Fortune. (Boeing declined to make Yutko or other managers available for this story. Yutko, however, sent a message that read in part: \u201cBecause I\u2019m just getting my feet wet in this new role and drinking from a firehose a bit, I\u2019ll follow the comms team lead on this one.\u201d) Adds Gary Gysin, the founding CEO of Wisk, where Yutko served on the board before taking the helm: \u201cOne guy won\u2019t fix everything, but he\u2019ll help attract more like-minded younger people who will be more aggressive on the tech front.\u201d Several sources I spoke to said that Yutko\u2019s leadership and technical skills could take him a long way at Boeing.\n\nOf course, that will certainly depend on how Yutko helps Boeing navigate the flight ahead\u2014a period in which the company is in the early stages of exploring what could be a $25 billion bet on a brand-new plane, something that the aerospace giant only does once every few decades. Legendary aerospace analyst Richard Safran summarizes the promise and peril Yutko\u2019s facing as this: \u201cHe\u2019s a classic MIT, somewhat brilliant guy. Who hasn\u2019t demonstrated he knows how to make money yet.\u201d\n\nBoeing is at a critical juncture. The seeds of its current problems date back to the late 1990s following its acquisition of rival McDonnell Douglas. Before that giant tie-up, Boeing had boasted a culture dominated by engineering excellence that elevated product quality and safety far above profit-making. Though Boeing remained a wellspring of innovation, the McDonnell ethos took over, and was accelerated by a parade of CEOs who seemed to prioritize shareholder value above all. From 2010 to 2018, Boeing radically reduced headcount and R&D as a share of sales, and returned over 100% of its cash flow to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Over those eight years, its stock delivered annual returns of nearly 30%, beating the likes of Apple and Microsoft.\n\nBut the fatal Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes in late 2018 and early 2019 exposed how far Boeing had veered from the quality obsession and production safeguards that were hallmarks of its storied past. (You can read this author\u2019s cover story on Boeing\u2019s descent here.)\n\nNow Ortberg\u2019s plan to gradually raise the severely depressed production of its cash cow Max is showing green shoots, but to ensure dominance in the next decade, Boeing\u2019s top chance at besting Airbus is designing and successfully commercializing a totally new and disruptive 737 successor. \u201cBoeing\u2019s not in a good place from a product portfolio standpoint,\u201d says a former executive at a large Boeing supplier. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been for four to six years. The new plane can\u2019t be a me-too. When you\u2019re behind, you need to be aggressive. They have to come up with something that\u2019s a real crowd-pleaser for the airlines. And they have to develop the new plane right on schedule to restore their credibility after the delays on the 787,\u201d the last all-new plane that arrived three years late in 2011.\n\nMuch of this will fall to Yutko. To say it\u2019s a tall order is an understatement, but as interviews with colleagues, peers, and friends show, he has again and again surprised those around him. His unlikely rise to the Fortune 500 began in Northeastern Pennsylvania coal country. His hometown\u2019s the tiny village of Buck Mountain nestled near the foothills of Locust Mountain, a hikers\u2019 favorite roamed by white-tailed deer and black bears. Decades ago, one of the biggest draws for this corner of Appalachians was its rowdy annual beer fest. This region comprising historic Schuylkill County holds the world\u2019s largest deposits of anthracite black carbon, but the industry\u2019s decline decimated the local economy. Since the 1930s, Schuylkill has lost around a third of its population, and its often-crumbling homes at a median of $165,000 rank among the nation\u2019s cheapest. Less than 20 miles from Yutko\u2019s alma mater, Mahanoy City High School\u2014where in 2022 he delivered the keynote address to the graduating class of 49, the smallest in its history\u2014sits a virtual ghost town where a coal seam fire has been burning for over 60 years. Brian\u2019s ancestors migrated over a century ago from Eastern Europe to the area\u2019s then-bustling company towns, and generations of Yutkos have worked in the coal trade.\n\nYutko\u2019s dad ran a shop that changed springs for coal mining trucks, and Brian worked alongside him as a kid. \u201cWhen Brian got his master\u2019s at MIT, I invited his parents to dinner,\u201d remembers his mentor Hansman. \u201cIt was the first time his father had ever been out of the state, and the first time his mother had left the county.\u201d\n\nYutko and his two brothers were the first in the family to attend college\u2014the younger a project engineer at a large power and metals company who also volunteers as a high school wrestling coach in the area, as does the youngest\u2014all three honed clinches and armlocks on the mats at Mahanoy. At Penn State, where Yutko graduated in 2004, he majored in aerospace engineering and developed a love for jerry-rigging airborne vehicles from everyday materials. In a recent Reddit post, he recalled joining \u201ca project that designs and builds a sailplane\u201d and getting assigned to \u201cweld out metal chromoly tube fuselage \u2026 because I knew how to weld.\u201d Yutko didn\u2019t mention whether he learned the metal-bending skills at the family workplace, but jested: \u201cI\u2019m positive my welding wouldn\u2019t pass proper inspection.\u201d\n\nAt MIT, Hansman demanded that his PhD candidates pursue work that wasn\u2019t just theoretical, but would improve the way airplanes fly and operate so that the next wave would show big strides in curbing emissions and lowering noise. \u201cYou think of MIT as teaching heavy math, nerdy kinds of things,\u201d says a fellow program member. \u201cBut Hansman was very applied and practical.\u201d Hansman was also a super-tough taskmaster who, as this Yutko classmate avows, \u201cdidn\u2019t suffer fools gladly\u201d and would put his doctoral candidates through \u201ca tear down and rebuild mill.\u201d Glancing at a piece of research, he\u2019d charge, \u201cThis is wrong\u201d or \u201cThis is BS,\u201d mainly as a test for prompting students to vigorously push back. Once the presenter on the griddle \u201cdefended their position to the death,\u201d they could often persuade their revered leader.\n\nFor years, in addition to their Cessna-piloting adventures, Yutko joined Hansman and Yutko\u2019s best friend, NASA astronaut and engineer Woody Hoburg, on motorcycle sojourns on their rented BMW 1200 rigs between Christmas and New Year\u2019s to exotic corners of the globe, from the deserts of Morocco to the valleys of Peru. During COVID, Yutko and Hoburg, a former rescue climber in Yosemite, camped in Red Rock Canyon near Las Vegas to practice their technical skills deploying lines and harnesses. On foot, Yutko has braved the race to the summit of Pikes Peak, a grueling contest that scales 7,800 vertical feet.\n\nA slim six-footer, his brown hair close-cropped, Yutko in his Wisk incarnation favored T-shirts and jeans. At work, he can be intense and demanding. \u201cHe and I are both \u2018A\u2019 types, and we had quite a few battles,\u201d says ex\u2013Wisk boss Gysin, who adds that Yutko \u201cwould really dig in on an issue\u201d and relentlessly hammer home his position, a stance he learned in the Hansman crucible at MIT. \u201cI have a number of non-consensus views on a number of topics,\u201d Yutko admitted in a recent podcast. Yet Gysin says that despite their dustups, he and Yutko \u201care friends to this day.\u201d\n\nAccording to fellow students and colleagues, Yutko\u2019s as likable as he is doggedly determined. Marvels Hansman, \u201cWe\u2019d go to a bar on the Moroccan coast on our motorcycle trips, and Brian would make friends with all the guys in the bar,\u201d says Hansman. \u201cHe\u2019s just magnetic.\u201d\n\nLishuai Li, a fellow PhD student under Hansman and now a professor at City University of Hong Kong, attests to Yutko\u2019s gift for putting people at ease. \u201cAs an international student, I sometimes feel hesitant in social settings, so I\u2019d sometimes be quiet. But Brian had a natural way of making everyone feel included.\u201d Yutko is married, and he and his wife, who holds an MBA from Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business and previously worked as a White House advance aid, recently welcomed a son.\n\nAnd Yutko\u2019s funny. In interviews, he lampoons his own wonkish credentials by uncorking such quips as, \u201cI\u2019ll do a little systems engineering on your question.\u201d As a PhD student, he coauthored a semi-satirical editorial that echoes 18th-century essayist Jonathan Swift\u2019s tongue-in-cheek \u201cA Modest Proposal.\u201d The piece soberly calculates the dollars airlines could save if \u201cthey could provide incentives for passengers to go the restroom before getting on a flight.\u201d The authors also get serious, extolling the fuel economies garnered by ditching such items as water bottles handed out by flight attendants, and replacing \u201cflight bags\u201d carrying heavy paper manuals, charts, and checklists with versions loaded on computerized tablets. The writing is so clever that, for this judge, it could have been penned by a professional pundit.\n\nHansman praises Yutko\u2019s willingness to take chances when the potential payoff is big. \u201cThis is a guy who listens, who thinks things through, who assesses risk, but doesn\u2019t have fear,\u201d he observes.\n\nAfter getting his PhD in 2014, Yutko split his time between MIT and Aurora Flight Sciences, an engineering firm that primarily created prototypes of unmanned, electric, and other next-gen planes, helicopters, and drones for the Department of Defense. At Aurora, he participated in a NASA design competition for a revolutionary, highly efficient commercial aircraft configuration called the D8. Boeing teams were competing on other models. Traditional aircraft design features a pressured tube for the passengers flanked by wings. But the D8 put two tubes side by side, which made the fuselage wider, enabling it to, in effect, become part of the wing and add to the lift. The design also placed the engines in the tail, which reduced turbulence from the fuselage. The D8 looked a bit like a shark, and won the moniker \u201cDouble Bubble.\u201d Its edge: It could carry wings smaller and lighter than those of regular planes because of the extra lift provided by the reshaped fuselage. Those characteristics lowered drag big-time. The D8 was also originally conceived to fly at slightly lower than normal speeds, a key to saving fuel that Yutko had identified in his doctoral work.\n\nYutko tested D8 forerunners in a new wind tunnel donated to MIT by Boeing. The D8\u2019s stupendous goal: lowering fuel consumption by 70%. The tech incorporated in the D8 is still a contender for the new wave of narrow-bodies, and the program would prove Yutko\u2019s ticket to Boeing.\n\nYutko had caught the eye of then\u2013Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who picked the rising star for personal mentorship as part of a Boeing program where top executives nurture future leaders. By early 2023 Yutko was ready for a new challenge, which presented itself when autonomous flying-taxi startup Wisk, (founded by Google cofounder Larry Page but majority owned by Boeing) needed a new CEO. Yutko moved to Silicon Valley for the job.\n\nThe Wisk rises like a helicopter; then six of its forward rotors tilt outward, and it flies like a plane. Yutko foresaw a network of \u201cvertiports\u201d at airports, topping highways and mounted on rooftops ferrying passengers up to 100 miles in what he widely praised as possibly \u201cthe next big leap in aviation.\u201d Given the resistance of pilots\u2019 unions and traffic controllers, and skepticism from regulators, for autonomous flight, it\u2019s unclear when or if Wisk will reach the market. Still, Yutko continued to advance autonomous technology and added AI applications to simulate flight planning and patterns. Those improvements could potentially improve safety and testing on commercial planes.\n\nOf course, any decision on a new plane will fall to Ortberg and the Boeing board. Once they approve takeoff, the aircraft-maker typically taps two leaders to head a greenfield project, according to an executive who worked for a Boeing supplier: a program manager, and a lead project engineer. The program manager is tasked with hitting key milestones for schedule and costs, and reports to the business side. The lead project engineer is responsible for working with the supply base to optimize the plane\u2019s design and development, and bring it to market. That person is part of the engineering team that, it appears, would work closely with Yutko as chief of commercial airplane development. \u201cYou can\u2019t BS Brian on the engineering side,\u201d noted one of his former colleagues.\n\nWhat\u2019s this airborne breakthrough likely to look like? The advantage to the super avant-garde models Yutko knows so well is that the airframes themselves promise tremendous gains in fuel efficiency and CO2 reductions. The D8 \u201cDouble Bubble\u201d technology that Yutko labored on featuring the bulbous fuselage is still a leading candidate. Another potential winner is the so-called X-66, also known as the jawbreaker transonic truss-braced wing or TTBW. Conceived in-house at Boeing, and long supported by grants from NASA, the X-66 features extra-long, thin wings supported by diagonal struts, so that from the nose you\u2019re looking at two triangles.\n\nIn April, Boeing scrapped pursuit of an X-66 demonstrator in partnership with NASA, but pledged to keep working on thin-wing technology. It\u2019s not clear if the TTBW or another model will prove the winner, but Yutko has expressed openness to new aircraft configurations. \u201cIt\u2019s really an open book,\u201d says Hansman. Yutko will be leading the evaluation of all the technical and design options, including the use of alternative fuels and new engine technologies, as well as automation.\n\nIn October of 2024, Yutko gathered with many of Hansman\u2019s former students to salute their beloved teacher\u2019s 70th birthday with a series of lectures. Yutko took the stage for a presentation reviewing 210 years of aviation history. He started by recapping the first primitive, butterfly-shaped gliders, reminding the audience, \u201c[I\u2019m] as you all know \u2026 a future-thinker,\u201d then spotlighted the \u201copportunity for new airplane shapes\u201d and lauded the \u201cDouble Bubble \u2026 that came out of MIT\u201d and \u201cthat I\u2019m so passionate about.\u201d\n\nBoeing watchers may similarly hope that the storied company is entering a new era, too. And Boeing finally has what it needs, a visionary engineer who can pilot this lagging colossus towards winning the big one, the contest for the aircraft of the future.",

      "text": "It was the blowout heard round the world.\nIt was Jan. 5, just after Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 had taken off from Portland, Ore., en route to Ontario, Calif., when a two-by-four-foot panel blew out at three miles high, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Boeing 737-9 Max. \u201cThere was the loudest explosion,\u201d recalled passenger Joan Marin. \u201cThe wind, the noise, the roar.\u201d Terrified passengers grabbed for falling oxygen masks. The intense vacuum ripped the V-neck sweater and T-shirt from a 15-year-old in a window seat at the edge of the void, and sent his headset and cell phone flying into the evening sky.\nFor Boeing, the company that built the plane, it was a crushing blow. The 108-year-old corporate icon had been dogged by safety concerns since two fatal crashes darkened its reputation and sent its finances reeling a half-decade ago\u2014the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines disasters that together killed 346 people. The response to those catastrophes got then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg fired, and current CEO David Calhoun, a 26-year GE veteran, took the helm in January of 2020. Professed Calhoun following the door blowout: \u201cWe\u2019re going to approach this, number one, by acknowledging our mistake. We\u2019re going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency every step of the way.\u201d The disaster\u2019s jet stream claimed the 737\u2019s program\u2019s production chief, whom Boeing ousted on February 21.\nCustomers were not appeased. In a CNBC interview on Jan. 23, outspoken United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby declared that the Alaska Airlines accident will significantly set back the timeline for approval of the 737-10, which Kirby had previously chosen as a principal aircraft in United\u2019s ambitious blueprint for expansion. He isn\u2019t saying that United will cancel its standing orders. But he strongly suggests that his airline is no longer making the 737-10 the main vehicle for the liftoff to come. \u201cWe\u2019re going to at least build a plan that doesn\u2019t have the Max 10 in it,\u201d said Kirby. \u201cThe Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for us.\u201d\nAs customers fumed, Boeing\u2019s principal regulator imposed tough new restrictions that will greatly limit the planemaker\u2019s freedom of action. On Jan. 24, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) took the extraordinary measure of capping the output for the entire Max lineup now in commercial production, consisting of the 737-8 and 737-9, at the current rate of 38 per month. That\u2019s a serious blow, since Boeing was basing its comeback campaign on gradually raising its monthly Max output to 50 by 2025 or 2026. As part of its expansion blueprint, Boeing had planned to open a new production line at its facility in Everett, Wash., for the Max, north of the plant in Renton, where it makes all its 737s today. But the Portland catastrophe prompted the FAA to withhold approval for now on the Everett addition, until Boeing shows the progress required by the FAA. In a press release, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker declared: \u201cThis won\u2019t be back to business as usual for Boeing.\u201d\nBoeing\u2019s trajectory from here towers as one of the most significant business dramas of this millennium. U.S. airlines carried over 900 million passengers in 2023, over one-quarter more than in 2013 and roughly matching pre-pandemic numbers. Boeing produced around 40% of the 29,000 commercial aircraft filling the skies worldwide. This is the company that launched the jet age; created the world\u2019s first wide-body in its fabled 747; ranks as America\u2019s third biggest defense contractor behind Lockheed Martin and RTX, and has long reigned as America\u2019s largest exporter. But Boeing is stumbling just when it should be capitalizing on the boom.\nThe rub is that Boeing\u2019s quality shortcomings\u2014and heavy dependence on a far-flung network of suppliers\u2014are recurring and deep-seated. The problem isn\u2019t merely that one worker on one assembly line failed to install a door screw. It was that managerial decisions, made over a period that spanned more than 20 years and four CEOs, gradually weakened a once vaunted system of quality control and troubleshooting on the factory floor, leaving gaps that have allowed sundry defects to slip through. Many weren\u2019t related to airline safety but caused long delays; others had major and tragic consequences. \u201cThe seeds of these quality problems were planted a long time ago. These problems were hidden for years, then they exploded,\u201d says a former top executive at a Boeing supplier.\nWhen Boeing taxied toward \u201ccapital light\u201d manufacturing, Wall Street got exactly what it wanted. Investors were richly rewarded; for one heady stretch in the 2010s, Boeing\u2019s shares outperformed those of Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. But it would ultimately be Boeing\u2014and its passengers\u2014that would end up paying the price.\nBoeing tries to build a \u2018neutral\u2019 nerve center\nThe structural weaknesses in Boeing\u2019s planemaking flow can actually be quite neatly traced to strategic missteps that took root over three decades ago.\nSurprisingly, the first big mistake occurred under CEO Phil Condit, an engineer steeped in the tradition of caution, safety, and excellence in design. In 2001, Condit persuaded the board to relocate Boeing\u2019s headquarters to Chicago from Seattle, where the C-suites were a short drive to the giant plants in Renton and Everett that generated the lion\u2019s share of revenue. The idea was to establish a \u201cneutral\u201d nerve center in easier traveling distance to Boeing\u2019s other businesses, including its defense and space arm in Arlington, Va. Then in 2022, Boeing relocated again, this time to Arlington.\nShifting the top brass far from Boeing\u2019s biggest business, and the one that\u2019s suffered the severest problems, was a huge mistake in the opinion of several of Boeing suppliers and clients Fortune spoke to. Says a former top executive at a Boeing customer whom Fortune interviewed on background: \u201cWhy take one of the greatest manufacturing companies in the world and create a de-linkage between the leadership and the wrench-turners who make the company go?\u201d this person asks. \u201cThat, coupled with all the outsourcing, created a kind of Frankenstein without enough command and control.\u201d\nAnd Boeing\u2019s current top executives are now extremely dispersed. Though the commercial aircraft chiefs are based in Seattle, CFO Brian West and the treasurer work from suburban Connecticut, and the HR and PR heads from Orlando. It\u2019s not clear how much time Calhoun, who served as chairman before being named CEO, spent in Renton or Everett, prior to the Portland disaster. He\u2019s stated that Boeing\u2019s headquarters \u201cis wherever Brian and I happen to be.\u201d The 66-year-old boss has two homes\u2014one on a lake in New Hampshire, and one in a gated community in South Carolina.\nA landmark shift in Boeing\u2019s direction began when it purchased defense contractor McDonnell Douglas in mid-1997. Before the merger, the planemaker had been \u201can association of engineers dedicated to building great flying machines,\u201d who put design and quality above all else, in the words of journalist Jerry Useem, who wrote a Fortune piece based on extensive interviews at Boeing in 2000, when the battle between the engineering and profit-boosting camps was storming. The prime change agent was McDonnell Douglas chief Harry Stonecipher, a 27-year GE veteran, who became Condit\u2019s number two. Son of a Tennessee coal miner, Stonecipher expressed admiration of President Harry Truman for his decision to use nuclear weapons versus Japan. (Stonecipher famously loved delivering his variation on a quote from Truman: \u201cI give \u2019em hell and tell them the truth, and they think it\u2019s hell!\u201d) Most of all, Stonecipher was a hawk on raising shareholder value and pushing down costs. He rallied the troops to be \u201cless of a family and more of a team.\u201d\nPrior to the early 2000s, Boeing had built most key portions of its planes in-house, from fuselages to landing gear. As an internal debate raged over whether to embrace a new, low-cost outsourcing model, a Boeing engineer named John Hart-Smith presented a white paper arguing that the new, decentralized approach risked not providing sufficient on-site technical support and quality control of contractors. \u201cThe manufacturer is only as good as the least good of its suppliers. Costs don\u2019t go down, because the risks are out of sight,\u201d wrote Hart-Smith.\nStonecipher, then president, and commercial aircraft chiefAlan Mulally\u2013\u2013backed strongly by new director Jim McNerney, another GE alumnus\u2014pushed for a new, \u201cclean sheet\u201d wide-body that Boeing could build at far lower cost than its previous version, the 777. Both Boeing and Airbus had long deployed subcontractors, though both built the major systems in-house. But for the 787, Boeing launched not just a new aircraft, but an entirely original business model. It signed \u201cpartners\u201d who contributed billions toward the project in advance, in exchange for long-term contracts for supplying the key portions of the aircraft. Among the recruits were GE for engines, Rockwell Collins for traffic alert systems, and Spirit AeroSystems for fuselages. The new paradigm, management reckoned, would allow the planemaker to move quickly so that it wouldn\u2019t lose orders to the forthcoming Airbus A380. By contrast, Airbus didn\u2019t need partners for funding. It regularly secured its development backing for new models from the French and German governments.\nIn the 787 program, Boeing radically altered its flight plan and diverged from its chief rival by adopting a less capital-intensive model and focusing more strongly on where it could add the greatest value, in hatching the overall design and providing final assembly.\nBut the 787 \u201cpartnering\u201d approach required a totally different manufacturing blueprint from Boeing\u2019s use of subcontractors in the past. \u201cThe 787 set Boeing on its ear,\u201d says Richard Safran, a former aerospace engineer at Northrop Grumman who\u2019s now an analyst at Seaport Research Partners. \u201cBoeing was saying to its suppliers, \u2018You design the part or section, and tell us how you\u2019ll build it. You need to do integration work. Now all the suppliers are mini-Boeings. They\u2019re suddenly investing in design and engineering work, not just making the parts Boeing designed for them. It was hard for Boeing to control quality in that system, and it still is.\u201d For Safran, Boeing never lost its talent for topflight engineering. The problem was that starting with Stonecipher, its CEOs layered on an obsession with hammering down expenses that conflicted with Boeing tradition and sowed confusion. \u201cThe cost culture was the culprit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt started with Stonecipher, and his successors executed on it.\u201d\nTwo decades of tumult\nThe 787 Dreamliner, and Boeing\u2019s embrace of outsourcing, had a rocky takeoff. The plane was three years late when the airlines got their first deliveries in 2011. For several years, Boeing booked losses on each Dreamliner that rolled out from the assembly plants near Charleston, S.C., and in Everett. The extra costs ballooning from the contractors\u2019 design miscues and production delays, along with Boeing\u2019s errors in assembling systems made in Japan, South Korea, Italy, France, and Sweden, meant that all the outsourcing that was supposed to reap big savings backfired. In a 2011 speech, top Boeing executive Jim Albaugh stated that it never would have experienced those huge overruns if it had kept the technology closer to Boeing.\nStill, the 787 proved a massive hit. \u201cBoeing was brilliant in introducing a plane that flew direct routes and had extremely long range, while Airbus competed with the A380 that was a hub-and-spoke plane,\u201d says Safran. \u201cThe 787 won. The airlines wanted a plane that had longer range and flew point to point.\u201d The new chief of the 787 program, Pat Shanahan, recently named CEO of Boeing\u2019s troubled supplier Spirit AeroSystems, in 2008 camped out at the Everett plant and managed to get production flowing smoothly.\nBut for McNerney, the lingering losses the 787 generated made it essential for Boeing to escalate its war on costs. In 2011, he introduced a now-notorious initiative called \u201cPartnering for Success\u201d that consisted of pressuring all contractors to lower their prices, generally in the range of 10% to 15%, or even more. Those who refused often got placed on a \u201cno-fly list\u201d that barred them from bidding on new programs. McNerney declared that it was \u201cout of kilter\u201d for suppliers to reap bigger margins than Boeing. McNerney threatened to bring production of wings and other key systems in-house as a lever to garner reductions. \u201cHe kept toggling back and forth between saying suppliers are incompetent, and that we have to push out more and more business to suppliers,\u201d says a former executive at one of Boeing\u2019s large contractors. \u201cBoth are incorrect. You need to rely on suppliers whenever they can do things better than you can, at competitive cost.\u201d McNerney was known both inside Boeing and by suppliers as a big picture strategist not deeply involved on the operating side. He enraged the rank and file by stating in 2014 that he wouldn\u2019t retire at 65 because \u201cthe heart will still be beating, employees will still be cowering.\u201d\nIn the period starting around 2011, Boeing started revving on all engines. The 787 dominated wide-body sales, and the 737 Max series, which began collecting orders in 2011 and featured the fuel-efficient GE LEAP engine, also proved a big hit, garnering huge orders from American, United, and Southwest. In 2015, Muilenburg replaced McNerney in the pilot\u2019s seat, and continued the strong focus on lowering costs and delivering big shareholder returns. From the close of 2010 through 2018, Boeing\u2019s financial performance was extraordinary. In that eight-year span, it multiplied its free cash flow sixfold, and its stock vaulted from $70 to $425. It posted total annual returns of 29.5%, waxing Microsoft (21.7%), Apple (19.6%), and Alphabet (18.0%). Those results demonstrate how profitable Boeing can be when not beset by quality failings.\nBut the eight-year run of fantastic profits was brought to a halt by the two tragic crashes in 2018 and 2019, caused by the faulty design of a new flight control software system that repeatedly pushed down the nose of the then-new 737-8 Max. Those disasters exposed the problems that had been lurking for years. And Ed Pierson witnessed firsthand the simmer building to a boil.\nA whistleblower explains where Boeing went wrong\nPierson, a former Naval flight officer, worked as a senior manager on the Renton factory floor from 2015 to late 2018 during this boom period. Today, he\u2019s executive director of the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a newly created nonprofit, and in 2019, he testified before Congress as a whistleblower, warning of potential manufacturing safety issues on the Max that he witnessed developing on the job. Those issues had everything to do with the toxic combination of a complex network of suppliers colliding with soaring demand for new planes. \u201cThe CFM LEAP-1B engines would come in late,\u201d Pierson told Fortune. \u201cSo the planes would move down the assembly line to the next station missing engines and other parts. The workers farther back on the line had to rush down the line with their tools and interrupt the workers at the later stage to install the parts scheduled to be installed days before. That out-of-sequence work is a dangerous practice.\u201d\nHe also claims that Boeing changed its inspection protocols to raise the pace. Part of the change, he says, involved laying off experienced quality control inspectors, and in lieu of the human inspections relying on a combination of \u201cmodern inspection technologies,\u201d random statistical analysis, and more reliance on self-inspections by assembly-line workers. He notes that inspections were lowered, not eliminated. \u201cIn 2018, on weekends, we\u2019d bring on hundreds of manufacturing employees on overtime, and we\u2019d have less quality inspectors than we used to have, and those that remained were very overworked.\u201d\nIn addition, says Pierson, Boeing did an inadequate job fixing problems identified by frontline workers. \u201cThe reality is that when workers would speak up, sometimes they weren\u2019t listened to at all,\u201d he observes. \u201cMost times, they were listened to, but that didn\u2019t solve the problem. The people they informed tried to resolve those issues, but they often didn\u2019t get fixed, because Boeing didn\u2019t supply the resources or capacity to do what was needed.\u201d Concludes Pierson, \u201cIt was obviously a dangerously unstable operation. The culture on the factory floor was, \u2018This is production. You need to get your job done.\u2019\u201d\nBoeing has stated publicly that although it announced plans to lay off 900 inspectors in early 2019, it didn\u2019t implement the plan, and has increased the number of quality inspectors 20% since 2019.\nAfter the second crash, Muilenburg acted as if shareholders, not passengers and airlines, were his core constituency. He declared that planes\u2019 safety systems were \u201cdesigned properly\u201d and that the pilots didn\u2019t \u201ccompletely\u201d follow the procedures Boeing had outlined to prevent the malfunctions that cost the 346 lives. The comments didn\u2019t sit well with the FAA. Then, in late 2019, Muilenburg publicly speculated that the FAA would return the Max to service by December of that year, further riling the agency. \u201cI had to rein that in; I had him to my office,\u201d Stephen Dickson, who served as FAA chief from 2019 to 2022, told Fortune. \u201cI told Dennis, \u2018This doesn\u2019t help that you\u2019re putting out projections on what\u2019s an FAA decision. We\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat.\u2019 Dennis was over his skis on some significant cultural issues. They needed a change.\u201d Eleven days later, the Boeing board fired Muilenburg.\nDickson cites that after the crashes, Boeing\u2014in cooperation with the FAA\u2014started implementing a new protocol called Safety Management System that encourages the line workers to report any quality issues and other safety concerns, and for Boeing to more systematically troubleshoot areas of risk around the production process. The FAA also removed Boeing\u2019s ability to independently approve the issuance of \u201cairworthiness certificates\u201d that allow planes to be released for delivery, and mandated that the agency inspectors provide all sign-offs. Following the Portland incident, the FAA multiplied the number of inspectors on-site in Renton. Since the Portland blowout, Calhoun has strongly emphasized in meetings with frontline workers the importance of their speaking up on quality and safety issues.\nBoeing\u2019s shift to dependence on suppliers heightened the wave of defects that have brought so many delays, as well as steep losses, over the past half-decade. A case in point: the travails of a giant Boeing supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, manufacturer of the fuselages for both of Boeing\u2019s bestselling series, the 737 and 787. For almost 80 years, Boeing owned the facility in Wichita where Spirit now makes those giant cigar-shaped systems. But in 2005, it sold the Wichita facility to private equity firm Onex of Canada, which took Spirit public in late 2006, and deployed acquisitions to greatly expand its suite of products and systems. \u201cThe idea was, \u2018This big supplier is no longer part of Boeing, so it can also make systems for Airbus, Bombardier, and others, and hence the arrangement lowers the part of the overhead Boeing has to pay,\u201d says Safran. \u201cBut Boeing keeps a tight relationship with a trusted contractor. It was all part and parcel of Boeing\u2019s cost reduction initiative.\u201d\nBut the grounding of the 737 Max following the fatal crashes, and a walloping from the pandemic, forced Spirit to lay off thousands of experienced production and inspection personnel. Its stock dropped almost 70% from late 2019 to the close of 2023, and it bled $1.9 billion in free cash flow. Spirit\u2019s troubles boomeranged to plague Boeing. Starting in the fall of 2020 and into 2023, Boeing and its suppliers found quality problems, including defects in fuselages and other parts that delayed deliveries for years. Just last year, Boeing discovered mis-drilled and misaligned holes in the aft pressure bulkhead of the Max, part of the fuselages made by Spirit, that caused time-intensive repairs that delayed deliveries. Boeing and its suppliers corrected all problems, but the extensive rework plagued Boeing with delays and added costs.\nIn October, Spirit\u2019s CEO abruptly resigned. His replacement: None other than Pat Shanahan, the 31-year Boeing veteran who\u2019d helped rescue the 787 by swooping down on the Everett plant to smooth the production snafus. The same month, Boeing provided Spirit a sweeping financial aid package that includes an immediate cash infusion of $100 million for capital investment in tooling, and an increase in what Boeing will pay Spirit for 787 parts over the next two years of $455 million.\nAn anonymous whistleblower stated that during final assembly of the 737, Boeing removed the door plug to make repairs, but put it back in place without replacing any of the four bolts, so that the bolts \u201cwere not installed when Boeing delivered the plane. Our own records reflect this.\u201d According to the whistleblower, two defect reporting systems failed, so that they never alerted Boeing quality inspectors to examine and sign off on the plug. The National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s preliminary report, issued on Feb. 6, confirmed that Boeing workers had removed the panels\u2019 bolts and that the bolts were missing at the time of the accident. As the whistleblower characterized it, Boeing\u2019s production process was \u201ca rambling, shambling disaster waiting to happen.\u201d\nWhere Boeing goes from here\nThe outcome Boeing, its investors, and its customers fear most: a repeat of the delays that have saddled the manufacturer with giant stockpiles of planes waiting for delivery. The problem that triggered $16.7 billion in losses from 2019 to 2021 was the huge overhang of airliners Boeing was carrying in inventory. How did it accumulate that burden? Even after the first crash in 2018, Boeing kept producing planes at high speed to fulfill orders, even though the FAA\u2019s grounding of all Max aircraft made it impossible to deliver them. It even cleared employee parking lots for storage. Then, all the quality problems, plus new FAA design requirements, and routine maintenance on aircraft stored for many months delayed delivery once the FAA approved the Max for flight at the end of 2020. Today, Boeing is still holding a gigantic 200 MAX and 50 787s in inventory. The vast majority of these planes sit in what Boeing calls \u201cshadow factories,\u201d where they\u2019re undergoing heavy and expensive maintenance and rework. As Calhoun put it on the Q4 earnings call, \u201cWe still have a hangover from not being able to deliver planes. In our shadow factories, we put more hours into those airplanes than we do to produce it in the first place.\u201d\nThe blowout over Portland doesn\u2019t restrict Boeing from delivering those planes, and Calhoun predicts that Boeing will send virtually all the excess aircraft to their owners by year-end. Chinese airlines have begun taking delivery on 85 Max that, caught in the trade war with the U.S., have waited parked since 2019. Even at the current low levels of production, Boeing generated a substantial $4.4 billion in free cash flow for 2023. Calhoun predicts that it can raise that number to $10 billion by 2025 or 2026, almost the average in the glory times of 2016 to 2018, and still proceed slowly and cautiously. Investors cheered Boeing\u2019s results for Q4, 2023, lifting its share price over the following week by 5% to $211. J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman doesn\u2019t think that Boeing can rebound that fast, but still posits $8.6 billion in free cash flow in 2025.\nBut financial projections won\u2019t fix the culture issues that allowed these problems to fester. Despite his disillusioning times there, Pierson is wistful about his years in Renton. \u201cBefore working in production, I worked in flight testing at Boeing Field in Seattle, with a group of exceptional professionals that benefited from solid leadership. My boss\u2019s call sign as Navy pilot was \u2018Saint,\u2019 and rightly so, everyone loved working with the guy,\u201d recalls Pierson. \u201cThen, the leadership changed, and it wasn\u2019t nearly as wonderful. People were less encouraged to speak up about problems. It\u2019s all about leadership. Organization A has a great leader, then another leader comes in, and the organization falters.\u201d\nPierson says that every top executive and board member at Boeing should ask themselves one crucial question to determine if they\u2019re providing the right leadership. \u201cThe simple test is, \u2018In 2023, how many times did you spend time on the factory floor and listen to the concerns of the employees who are the backbone of the company?\u2019 If the answer is \u2018no,\u2019 you\u2019re clearly not the right person for the job.\u201d\nBut Pierson says that the culture of safety can spread through the entire company if Boeing gets the kind of leadership that once inspired the flight testing crew, leadership where the C-suite walks the factory floor, and that cherishes the expertise, and insists on getting facts and guidance from the folks who hand-make these extraordinary flying machines. In other words, Boeing can get its wings level, but only if the frontline workers have a hand on the joystick.\nA version of this article appears in the April/May 2024 issue of Fortune."
