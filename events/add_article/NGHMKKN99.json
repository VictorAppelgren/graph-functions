      "summary": "Trump’s trade war has pushed the average effective tariff rate on imports to 19%, generating an estimated $3 trillion in revenue over a decade while dampening growth and raising inflation. A recent U.S. Court of International Trade ruling halted most of the tariffs, but the administration may use alternative legal tools such as Section 122, 301, or 232 to maintain pressure. The policy is expected to slow U.S. GDP growth to about 1.5 % in 2025, increase borrowing costs, and keep inflation above 3 % until 2026, but it is unlikely to trigger a recession. The Federal Reserve’s ability to offset the fiscal drag is limited by rising debt and constrained monetary policy space.",
