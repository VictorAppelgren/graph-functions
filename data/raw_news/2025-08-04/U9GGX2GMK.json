  "title": "Greg Abbott threatens to expel Texas Democrats as they thwart redistricting",
  "description": "Greg Abbott has said that the absences of Texas Democrats that prevented a quorum were \"premeditated for an illegitimate purpose.\"",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove \"derelict Democrats\" from the state's House of Representatives if they fail to return by Monday afternoon.\n\nThe threat came after numerous Texas Democrats left their home state and traveled to Illinois in an effort to prevent the state legislature from holding a vote that would approve Republican-backed redistricting maps.\n\nIn a letter to the Democrats, Abbott wrote: \"Real Texans do not run from a fight. But that's exactly what most of the Texas House Democrats just did... rather than doing their job and voting on urgent legislation affecting the lives of all Texans, they have fled Texas to deprive the House of the quorum necessary to meet and conduct business.\"\n\nAbbott's threat intensifies the face-off over Republican efforts to redraw the districting map in Texas to bolster the party's chances of retaining the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections. Republicans in other states facing significant battleground contests have looked to follow a similar path.\n\nRepublicans have slim majorities in both the U.S. House and Senate, giving Democrats hopes of retaking at least one of the Houses of Congress in next year's elections.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nAbbott said in his statement that the Texas Democrats' absences were \"premeditated for an illegitimate purpose... the specific purpose of abdicating the duties of their office and thwarting the chamber's business.\"\n\nHe said their action amounted to \"an abandonment or forfeiture of an elected state office.\"\n\nHe added: \"This truancy ends now. The derelict Democrat House members must return to Texas and be in attendance when the House reconvenes at 3.00 p.m. on Monday.\n\n\"For any member who fails to do so, I will invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House.\"\n\nMore than 51 Democratic members of the Texas House left the state on Sunday, aiming to deny the chamber a quorum and prevent passage of the proposed Republican map before a scheduled floor vote. The Texas House requires the presence of at least 100 of its 150 members to conduct business.\n\nWith only 62 Democratic members in the chamber, their collective absence can halt legislative proceedings.\n\nAbbott had called a special session to address the flooding that killed 135 people last month in Texas Hill Country and the redistricting plan.\n\nDemocrats have argued that if Republicans succeed in redrawing the Texas districts, Trump will push other states to do the same.\n\nSpeaking in Chicago on Sunday, Texas House Democratic Caucus chair Gene Wu said: \"We're not here to play political games. We're here to demand an end to this corrupt process. Today is the day this corruption ends.\n\n\"If Donald Trump is allowed to do this, once again cheat and get away with it, there's no stopping this, it will spread across the country... and rip it apart.\"\n\nIllinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, said that the Texas Democrats had no choice but to leave their state to block the vote \"and protect their constituents.\"\n\n\"Let's be clear, this is not just rigging the system in Texas. It's rigging the system against the rights of all Americans for years to come,\" he said.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nAbbott said in his statement: \"In addition to abandoning their offices, these legislators may also have committed felonies. Many absentee Democrats are soliciting funds to evade the fines they will incur under House rules. Any Democrat who \"'solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept' such funds to assist in the violation of legislative duties or for purposes of skipping a vote may have violated bribery laws. See TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 36.02.\n\n\"The same could be true for any other person who 'offers, confers, or agrees to confer' such funds to fleeing Democrat House members. I will use my full extradition authority to demand the return to Texas of any potential out-of-state felons.\"\n\nThe Texas House Democratic Caucus said in response to Abbott's threat: \"Come and take it.\"\n\nColin Allred, a former Democratic Senate candidate for Texas, said in a statement:\"Texas House Democrats just did what this moment demands \u2014 they broke quorum to stop a blatant power grab. This wouldn't have happened without the thousands of Texans who showed up, testified, and refused to be ignored. You gave them the strength to act.\n\n\"This fight isn't just about maps \u2014 it's about power. When Republicans silence Black and Latino voters, they're not just rigging elections. They're rigging who gets health care, clean water, and a fair shot.\n\n\"Let's be clear: they don't just want to rig the vote. They want to use that power to rig the economy \u2014 to keep helping the wealthy and well-connected while working families get left behind.\"\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nTexas Republicans are attempting to find legal means of passing the proposed redistricting maps, though that may lead to a drawn-out legal battle.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is already reviewing a dispute over redistricting in Louisiana, and earlier this year overturned a lower court's decision that ruled South Carolina's congressional map as unconstitutional.",

The Dallas Cowboys owner wants his edge rusher suited up and playing with or without an extension in place.\nParsons doesn't want to play for the Cowboys until they make the offer he desires, while including his representation. Since the Cowboys haven't checked all of those boxes, Parsons has requested a trade.\nAfter Saturday's training camp session, the Cowboys' owner addressed the media for the first time since Parsons publicly claimed he made a trade request. Jones doesn't seem the least bit worried.\n\"I wouldn't be standing here with you if I didn't think we potentially had a great future with Micah,\" Jones told reporters, via The Athletic. \"It would be a waste of all of our time. We're in good shape. This is negotiation. But make no mistake about it, life has to go on if something happens to me or anybody else. Life does go on. This thing called the NFL, it's not about one person, me included, in a big way.\"\nParsons didn't hold out at all this offseason. While he wasn't a part of the team's voluntary OTAs, he showed up for mandatory minicamp in Texas and has been present for training camp in California. Even after demanding a trade, Parsons remained with the team.\nHowever, there hasn't been any on-field participation. And Saturday was the first time Parsons didn't wear his No. 11 practice jersey.\nWhile Jones was around the team, too, Parsons and the owner did not share words, according to Jones.\n\"In March, I met with Mr. Jones to talk about leadership. Somehow, the conversation turned into him talking contract with me. Yes, I engaged in a back-and-forth in regards to what I wanted from my contract, but at no point did I believe this was supposed to be a formal negotiation, and I informed Mr. Jones afterward, my agent would reach out, thinking this would get things done,\" Parsons wrote in his social media post.\n\"But when my agent reached out, he was told the deal was pretty much already done. My agent, of course, told him that wasn't the case, and also reached out to Stephen Jones again, the team decided to go silent. At that point, we decided we would allow the team to reach out to us whenever they decided they wanted to talk. Yet, still not a call, email or text to my agent about starting a negotiation. ... I have made a tough decision. I no longer want to play for the Dallas Cowboys. My trade request has been submitted to Stephen Jones, personally.\"\nWill the team try to honor Parsons' trade request? Jones doesn't plan on it at this time. He's confident the situation will work itself out over time. The owner assured the Dallas fan base.\n\"Don't lose any sleep over it,\" Jones said, according to reports.\nFor more Dallas Cowboys and NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports."

Inconsistencies may occur.\nTexas Democrats left their home state on Sunday and traveled to Chicago in an effort to prevent their state legislature from holding a vote that would approve Republican-backed redistricting maps.\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, helped arrange for the trip during a meeting with the Texas caucus last month. He has directed his staff to assist the Texas lawmakers with any necessary support during their stay.\nNewsweek has reached out to Pritzker's office by email outside of normal business hours on Sunday.\nWhy It Matters\nHistorically, the party in the White House loses seats, and Republicans have a slim majority in both the U.S. House and Senate, giving Democrats hopes of retaking at least one of the houses of Congress in next year's midterms.\nTexas Republicans have sought to redraw the districting map in an effort to bolster nationwide party chances of retaining the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections. Republicans in other states with significant battleground contests coming up have also looked to follow a similar path.\nWhat To Know\nMore than 51 Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives departed the state on Sunday, aiming to deny the chamber a quorum and prevent passage of a proposed Republican map before a scheduled floor vote. The Texas House requires the presence of at least 100 of its 150 members to conduct business.\nWith only 62 Democratic members in the chamber, their collective absence can halt legislative proceedings, according to the Associated Press.\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, had called a special session to address the flooding that killed 135 people last month in Texas Hill Country and the redistricting plan, which would redraw congressional boundaries and could potentially increase Republican-held seats from 25 to as many as 30 out of Texas' 38 districts.\nThe AP reported that Trump urged Texas Republicans to redraw the map.\nThe map targets Democratic-leaning areas in cities such as Austin, Dallas, Houston, and regions in south Texas. Republican leaders advanced their proposal through committee on Saturday and scheduled a key floor vote for Monday, prompting the Democrats' walkout.\nTexas Democrats had pulled a similar move in 2021 in order to block new voting restrictions that the state legislature was trying to pass.\nTexas House Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu told reporters during a news conference in Chicago with Pritzker that the redistricting was corrupt.\n\"We're not here to play political games. We're here to demand and end to this corrupt process,\" Wu said.\n\"Today is the day this corruption ends.\"\nFormer Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Trey Martinez Fischer called on fellow Democrats to \"cowboy up\" and oppose the effort by Republicans to \"steal\" democracy.\n\"This is not about the Democratic Party, it's about the democratic process,\" Fischer said.\n\"Republicans are stealing our democracy right before our very eyes. We will not have our democracy taken on our watch.\"\nWu said if the redistricting in Texas was allowed to go through others in both red and blue states would follow suit to the detriment of all.\n\"If Donald Trump is allowed to do this, once again cheat and get away with it, there's no stopping this, it will spread across the country...and rip it apart,\" Wu said.\nPritzker praised the Texas Democrats had no choice but to leave their state to block the vote \"and protect their constituents.\"\n\"This is a righteous act of courage,\" he said, adding: \"courage is contagious.\"\n\"Let's be clear, this is not just rigging the system in Texas. It's rigging the system against the rights of all Americans for years to come,\" Pritzker said.\nTexas House Speaker Dustin Burrows earlier warned his colleagues across the aisle that should they deny his party a quorum, then \"all options will be on the table.\" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton echoed that sentiment, writing on X that the party should use \"every tool at our disposal\" to deal with the runaway Democrats.\nExisting House rules allow for the arrest and fining of members for breaking quorum, including proposed $500-per-day fines, although they may prove difficult to enforce while lawmakers remain outside Texas, where state jurisdiction does not apply, according to ABC News.\nWhat People Are Saying\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on X on Sunday: \"Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately. We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.\"\nTexas state Representative Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, in a statement: \"This is not a decision we make lightly, but it is one we make with absolute moral clarity. We're not walking out on our responsibilities; we're walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent.\"\nDemocratic Party Chair Ken Martin in a statement said: \"For weeks, we've been warning that if Republicans in Texas want a showdown\u2014if they want to delay flood relief to cravenly protect Donald Trump from an inevitable midterm meltdown\u2014then we'd give them that showdown. That's exactly what Texas Democrats did today: blowing up Republicans' sham special session that's virtually ignored the plight of flood victims in Kerr County.\"\nWhat Happens Next?\nTexas Republicans will attempt to find legal means of passing the proposed redistricting, though that may lead to a drawn-out legal battle.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is already reviewing a dispute over redistricting in Louisiana, and earlier this year overturned a lower court decision that ruled South Carolina's congressional map was unconstitutional.\nThis article includes reporting by the Associated Press.\nUpdate 8/3/25, 10:59 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\nAbout the writer\nPeter Aitken is a Newsweek Politics Editor based in New York.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nHouse Oversight Committee Chair Rep. James Comer told Ghislaine Maxwell's attorneys the panel is willing to delay her subpoenaed deposition until after the Supreme Court rules on an appeal she has filed.\nWhy It Matters\nMaxwell's testimony remains \"vital\" to the committee's Jeffrey Epstein investigation.\nMaxwell had been serving a 20-year sentence in a Tallahassee, Florida Federal Correctional Institute after being convicted of helping Epstein recruit and abuse young girls as part of his sex-trafficking ring. On Friday, she was quietly relocated to the minimum security, Federal Prison Camp Bryan in Bryan, Texas, a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson told Newsweek.\nWhat To Know\nMaxwell's legal team had warned she would invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination unless certain conditions were met, including congressional immunity, conducting the deposition outside her prison, receiving advance questions, and waiting for the appeal's conclusion.\nComer has ruled out granting immunity or providing questions in advance. He added the panel is \"willing to engage in good faith negotiations\" and will continue its practice of holding detailed discussions about the scope of testimony.\nIt's not clear if the prison transfer is in response to Maxwell's requests to House Oversight.\nThe move comes just a week after Maxwell sat down for a two-day interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.\nBlanche has not yet commented on the contents of their discussion, but Maxwell's attorney Markus said Friday there have been \"no asks and no promises\" about clemency.\nMaxwell's Department of Justice conversations and looming Congressional testimony are taking place as pressure continues to build on Donald Trump and his administration, who made the release of the Epstein files a campaign promise.\nThe president has faced strong backlash, including from his own MAGA base, since July 6, when the DOJ and FBI released a joint memo that said the sex offender had \"no incriminating 'client list'\" and reiterated that he died by suicide in his jail cell in August 2019.\nTrump has come under additional scrutiny since The Wall Street Journal reported that in May, Attorney General Pam Bondi told the president his name appeared \"multiple times\" in the so-called Epstein files. This claim was dismissed as \"another fake news story\" by White House communications director Steven Cheung.\nWhat People Are Saying\nHolli Coulman, a prison consultant, told CNN Friday regarding Maxwell's prison move, \"This is absolutely unprecedented what transpired. Everybody is completely shocked.\"\nIn a statement issued after news broke of Maxwell's transfer, the family of Epstein accuser, the late Virginia Giuffre \u2014 joined by fellow accusers Annie and Maria Farmer \u2014 said, \"It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received. Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency. Yet, without any notification to the Maxwell victims, the government overnight has moved Maxwell to a minimum-security luxury prison in Texas.\"\nThe statement continued, \"The Trump administration should not credit a word Maxwell says, as the government itself sought charges against Maxwell for being a serial liar. This move smacks of a cover up. The victims deserve better.\"\nTrump said on Monday, when asked about a pardon for Maxwell, \"Well, I'm allowed to give her a pardon but nobody's approached me with it, nobody's asked me about it. It's in the news about that\u2014that aspect of it, but right now it would be inappropriate to talk about it.\"\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on X, ahead if his two-day interview with Maxwell last week, \"If Ghislaine Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nA Supreme Court decision on Maxwell's appeal is expected in late September.\nUpdate: 8/1/25, 7:55 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.\nAbout the writer\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor at Newsweek based in North Carolina.
