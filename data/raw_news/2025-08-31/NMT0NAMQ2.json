  "description": "With 277 horses, 460 pound-feet of torque, and a  9,300-pound towing capacity, the Duramax 3.0 is arguably one of the best diesel engines out there.",
  "content": "The Duramax name is not a new one, having first arrived on the scene back in January 2001. This wasn't a 3.0-liter inline-six; the Duramax was a 6.6-liter V8 diesel turbo engine designed to power GM's most capable trucks. As the years progressed, Duramax offerings expanded. Some years later, a potent but compact inline-four with a 2.8-liter capacity could be found under the hoods of a variety of GM SUVs and pickup trucks.\n\nArguably the most important update arrived in 2019, though, with the introduction of the 3.0-liter Duramax engine. This was a six-cylinder turbodiesel lump destined for GM's trucks, including the Sierra and Silverado 1500. What made the 3.0-liter Duramax so great was the impressive output: 277 horses and a huge 460 pound-feet of torque. The fact that 95% of this torque was available from just 1,250 rpm makes this one of the best diesel engines ever put in a pickup truck, as low-down torque is immensely handy when towing and hauling heavy loads. Speaking of which, its towing capacity was 9,300 pounds, which is mightily impressive. However, GM had even more in store for the Duramax lump: For the 2023 model year, this already impressive engine saw peak power and torque soar to 305 horses and 495 pound-feet.",

      "text": "5 Of The Best Diesel Engines Ever Put In A Pickup Truck\nDiesel engines have been a driving force in the pickup truck world since the early 20th century, and for good reason. While they started in industrial and agricultural equipment, it didn't take long for automakers to realize diesel's potential in pickup trucks. They quickly became the go-to for vehicles that wanted to take performance to the next level, with torque outputs, durability, and fuel economy that were hard to beat.\nBy the 1980s and beyond, diesel pickups weren't just for farms and job sites; they became the go-to for anyone needing a tough truck, synonymous with strength, capability, and reliability. Diesel engines have since gained a growing fan club that could give their gasoline counterparts a run for their money, and over the years, diesel tech has evolved to meet modern demands, bringing in cleaner emissions, smarter fuel systems, and even smoother driving dynamics.\nThis list highlights five of the best diesel engines ever put into a pickup truck. Powerplants that didn't just move metal, but shaped the industry and earned truck owners' undying loyalty and obsession. Whether you're a die-hard diesel fan or just diesel-curious, these engines are worth knowing (and admiring).\n5.9L 12-Valve Cummins\nThe 5.9-liter Cummins diesel engine, also known as the \"12-valve\" or the \"6BT\", was an instant hit from the moment it was dropped under the hood of the Dodge Ram in 1989. At a time when gas engines were all the rage and dominating the market, the 12-valve put industrial-grade torque in the hands of everyday drivers.\nOne of the biggest reasons for its cult following is its mechanical injection system. With no electronic controls, tinkering is easy. Farmers, mechanics, and truck enthusiasts alike love it for exactly that reason; you don't need a laptop to tune it, just a wrench and some diesel know-how.\nDespite its relatively modest factory specs (160\u2013215 horsepower and up to 440 lb-ft of torque), the 12-valve's cast-iron block, forged internals, and overbuilt components gave it massive potential. Tuners regularly squeeze out much more power with simple upgrades, and it's not uncommon to find these engines still running strong with over 500,000 miles on the clock.\nFord 6.7L Power Stroke V8\nFord's 6.7-liter Power Stroke came onto the scene in 2011, marking a new era for the brand and the Power Stroke nameplate. Earlier Power Stroke engines, like the 7.3 and the 6.4-liter offerings, were developed in partnership with Navistar International, but by 2009, tensions were high between the two brands, due to conflicts over warranty claims and pricing. The 6.7-liter, which had been in the works since 2008 under the codename 'Scorpion', was Ford's first diesel engine developed entirely in-house for their Super Duty trucks. This meant they had full developmental control and could create a diesel engine that reset expectations.\nOne of the standout features of the 6.7-liter Power Stroke is its reverse-flow layout, which places the exhaust inside the engine's V and the intake ports on the outside. This design switch-up was a good call by Ford, as it created a more compact turbocharger setup and improved throttle response. It also features a compacted graphite iron (CGI) block, which is stronger and lighter than traditional cast iron, improving both durability and fuel efficiency. Ford definitely did something right, as newer models of the 6.7-liter Power Stroke can push out up to 1,200 lb-ft of torque. This gives you the muscle needed for serious towing and hauling, but in a form factor that still works for daily driving.\n6.6L Duramax LBZ\nThe 6.6-liter LBZ Duramax V8, produced by General Motors from 2006 to 2007, is often hailed as one of the best diesel engines the company ever built. Despite its short production run, it left a lasting impression. And today, LBZ-powered trucks are highly sought after by diesel fans, collectors, and performance tuners alike.\nWhy exactly is the LBZ so loved? For starters, it was the last Duramax engine built before stricter emissions regulations kicked in. That means it came without a diesel particulate filter (DPF) and featured a less problematic exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system. Without the emissions add-ons that were introduced in the later models, the LBZ runs cooler, cleaner, and more efficiently, especially when modified.\nFrom the factory, the LBZ delivered a solid 360 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque, paired with the legendary Allison 1000 transmission. Its strong cast-iron block, forged steel crankshaft, and upgraded connecting rods made it a favorite for diesel performance builds. With minimal tuning, it can easily handle much more power, and many do. That rare mix of durability, simplicity, and serious performance potential is exactly why the LBZ remains a standout today.\nFord 7.3L Power Stroke\nWhen diesel enthusiasts talk about bulletproof engines, the 7.3-liter Power Stroke almost always comes up. Introduced in 1994 and discontinued in 2003, this turbocharged V8 quickly became a legend in the truck world and one of the best diesel engines ever built. Not for record-breaking horsepower, but for its unmatched reliability and longevity. With proper maintenance, it wasn't unusual for the 7.3 to sail past 250,000 miles, and many are still on the road today.\nBuilt during what some fans consider the golden age of diesel, the 7.3-liter Power Stroke was developed in partnership with Navistar International and featured HEUI (hydraulically actuated electronic unit injection) fuel systems, a cast-iron block, and forged internals. It was simple enough to maintain, tough enough to work hard every day, and forgiving of driver abuse, which is a combo made in heaven for fleets and DIYers alike.\nAlthough it wasn't the most powerful diesel even by early 2000s standards (topping out at around 275 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque), it earned its reputation by refusing to die. When Ford replaced it with the more complex and failure-prone 6.0-liter Power Stroke, many fans never forgave them. For countless truck owners, the 7.3-liter remains the gold standard for diesel durability.\n6.7L Cummins I-6\nThe 6.7-liter Cummins I-6 is the modern evolution of a staple diesel engine line, and it's earned its place under the hood of Ram Heavy Duty trucks since 2007. Designed to replace the beloved 5.9-liter Cummins, the 6.7 brought with it a host of upgrades that allowed it to meet stricter emissions standards while pushing performance to new levels. Cummins struck a smart balance between raw power and modern efficiency with features like a high-pressure common rail fuel system, variable geometry turbocharger (VGT), and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in the 6.7.\nWhere this engine really shines is in the numbers. In its latest high-output versions, it delivers up to 420 horsepower and over 1,000 lb-ft of torque, with the 2019 iteration being the first in its class to hit the coveted 1,000 lb-ft mark. The 6.7-liter is the reason why the 2024 Ram Heavy Duty is one of the trucks with the most torque. This gives Ram HD trucks top-notch towing capability and plenty of confidence to tackle steep grades and long hauls without flinching. Even with all the modern features, the straight-six layout keeps things simple and reliable. It's balanced, strong, and built to last, which is exactly what diesel fans love."

      "text": "Everything To Know About The GM 6.6 Liter LBZ V8 Duramax Turbo Diesel Engine\nThese days, the Duramax namesake is as linked with turbo diesel engines as peanut butter is to jelly. That wasn't always the case, though. In the late '80s and early '90s, GM's Detroit Diesel couldn't hold a candle to the rugged torque monsters in both the Cummins and PowerStroke turbo diesel lineups. It wasn't until 2001 that Dodge and Ford had a truly worthy opponent in the form of the GM LB7 Duramax.\nDespite being the new kid on the block, GM came out swinging with the LB7. Despite its class-leading torque figures and impressive overall performance, the LB7 had its fair share of teething problems. With reliability being such a crucial aspect of turbo diesel work truck engines, injector problems and head gasket issues kept the Duramax in third place behind Cummins and PowerStroke offerings despite the Duramax's impressive performance. While the second LLY iteration of the Duramax was a step up, the third generation LBZ Duramax \u2014 released in 2006 \u2014 was the engine that put the Duramax ahead of the competition.\nIn many ways, the LBZ Duramax simply took GM's existing turbo diesel formula that they had been refining for five years and turned it up to 11. The LBZ was built on the foundation of the previous LLY generation Duramax but was improved to provide better reliability, more power, and improved efficiency. It remained a relatively simple engine, despite the changes, which made it a fan favorite amongst turbo diesel enthusiasts long after its production ended in 2007.\nA big step up from the LLY\nDespite resembling the 2004-2005 LLY generation Duramax in terms of its overall design and construction, the LBZ is a significantly improved engine. Strength was never really an issue for previous Duramax engines, but as horsepower and torque figures continued to climb, GM fortified the LBZ to better handle extreme forces. The engine block was fortified using a thicker casting with additional main bearing webbing and improved cylinder bore strength. GM also beefed up other crucial internals, including new and improved forged steel connecting rods.\nThe fuel system was another critical aspect of improvement, with the LBZ receiving multiple new fuel system components. While the common-rail fuel system and high-pressure fuel injectors were a source of issue for the older LLY engine, the system was overhauled for the LBZ. GM increased the maximum fuel pressure from 23,000 psi to over 26,000 psi and updated the Bosch fuel injectors to a more efficient 7-hole design.\nGM also made some important revisions to the turbo arrangement to improve reliability and efficiency. The LBZ received revised low-compression pistons, which decreased the chances of engine-damaging detonation events and increased reliability overall. GM also revised the LBZ's turbo inlet manifold to a more free-flowing design, decreasing exhaust gas temperatures and delivering better turbo responsiveness. To tie it all together, GM introduced a new 32-bit E35 engine control module, which more effectively managed fuel flow and turbo parameters.\nAs a result of all of the upgrades compared to the previous generation LLY Duramax, the 2006 LBZ Duramax was the most reliable, efficient, and best-performing turbo diesel engine that GM created to that point.\nThe LBZ Duramax lived a very short life\nDespite being one of the most popular turbo diesel engines in history, the LBZ Duramax is tied with the LLY generation for having the shortest production run in the engine series' history. The LBZ was only produced for the 2006 and 2007 model years, eventually being replaced with the similar \u2014 yet slightly less impressive \u2014 LMM Duramax engine in 2007.\nThe LBZ Duramax arrived on the scene at a very turbulent time for turbo diesel engines due to increasingly stringent emissions requirements. Since the LBZ lacked modern diesel emissions devices, it lived a very short life under the hoods of only a few GM vehicles.\nIn fact, the LBZ Duramax only found a home in 2006-2007 Chevrolet Silverado HDs and 2006-2007 GMC Sierra HDs, making them a relatively scarce engine in comparison to later entries in the Duramax engine family. With such a short production run, it is safe to assume that there are far fewer LBZ engines out there than the 600,000 LML Duramax engines produced between 2010 and 2016.\nThe last dirty diesel\nBefore 2006, diesel engines \u2014 including engines in the Duramax engine series \u2014 did use multiple pieces of equipment to reduce diesel emissions. For example, the earlier LLY Duramax was the first engine in the series that featured required emissions tech, including an exhaust gas recirculation system that sent exhaust gasses back into the combustion chamber to burn off additional pollutants. The LLY also featured an EGR cooler and a catalytic converter to limit diesel emissions to an acceptable degree.\nHowever, in 2007, the U.S. government mandated that all fuel stations in the U.S. make the switch to Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) and required that any diesel vehicle manufactured after the 2007 model year must refuel only with ULSD fuel. Along with the rollout of ULSD came even more intense emissions equipment for diesel-powered vehicles, including diesel particulate filters (DPFs). Adding additional emissions equipment to any engine has a negative impact on performance, as it adds another restriction for exhaust gas to flow through before exiting the vehicle, especially when it gets clogged over years of driving.\nThe rollout of new emissions technology and Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel is the reason why the LBZ was replaced with the LMM engine in 2007 after only two years of production, as the LBZ lacked a DPF and other updated tech. However, that is the exact reason why most enthusiasts love the LBZ, as its lack of modern emissions equipment makes it a better engine to modify in addition to having a longer average engine life and achieving better fuel economy.\nPiston problems\nDespite being one of the most reliable engines in the Duramax engine family, the LBZ does have a couple of notable issues. Piston strength is one of the engine's major weak points. When the LBZ was designed with a lower compression ratio in mind, GM settled on a new cast aluminum design.\nThe newer piston design made use of thinner wrist pins and wrist pin bushings, which weren't used on earlier Duramax engines. While the revised design of the LBZ's rotating assembly mostly fixed the connecting rod issues that earlier LB7 and LLY engines suffered from, piston cracking became a major problem on the LBZ, especially on modified examples. The risk of cracking a piston on an LBZ becomes much higher around the 650 rwhp mark, as the high EGTs, advanced timing, and excessive heat near that power level significantly reduce the integrity of the pistons themselves.\nSo, it is a bit of a catch-22. While the LBZ is one of the easiest Duramax engines to squeeze massive amounts of power out of, it also has a catastrophic weakness in terms of its piston strength. For that reason, most professionals advise upgrading your LBZ pistons to a stronger aftermarket set if you intend on pushing beyond the 600-horsepower range.\nThe LBZ is the golden child of the Duramax lineup\nNearly 20 years after the LBZ Duramax was released, it is still one of the most popular engines in the entire GM turbo diesel lineup. 2006-2007 LBZ-equipped Silverado and Sierra HDs are some of the most highly sought-after trucks in GM's catalog to this day, mainly due to the engine itself. The base MSRP for a GMC Sierra HD was $23,125 in 2007. The same truck's average value today \u2014 18 years later \u2014 is $17,615 according to Carfax.com. That goes to show how well those trucks hold their value and how much enthusiasts seek to own an LBZ-powered truck.\nOutside of the LBZ's reputation for being one of the least problematic, most modifiable, and most efficient turbo diesel power plants ever offered by GM, there are some other auxiliary reasons why people love the 6.6L V8 so much. The LBZ was the first Duramax engine mated to the now-famous Allison 1000 automatic transmission, often considered one of the most bulletproof transmissions offered in GM's turbo-diesel lineup. The 6-speed automatic provided a much better overall driving experience than the outgoing 5-speed Allison transmission that preceded it in the LLY."
