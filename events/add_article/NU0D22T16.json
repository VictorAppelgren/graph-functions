      "summary": "Microsoft remains a top-performing mega-cap, delivering 20% growth this year and 135% over five years, driven by its Azure cloud and AI initiatives such as Co‑Pilot. Bill Mann highlights Microsoft’s diversified tech stack and resilience, noting Azure’s 34% growth and a $30 billion CapEx push. Risks include potential disintermediation from OpenAI’s independence ambitions and power‑grid constraints that could throttle AI demand. Despite these, Microsoft is positioned as a high‑quality investment in the AI‑cloud space.",
