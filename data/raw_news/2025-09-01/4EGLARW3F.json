  "description": "A strong earthquake in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border has destroyed numerous villages and and caused extensive damage",
  "content": "A magnitude 6.0 earthquake was reported Sunday 17 miles from Jalalabad, Afghanistan, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nA strong earthquake in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border has destroyed numerous villages and and caused extensive damage, killing at least 250 people and injuring at least 500 others, officials said. The deaths and injuries were expected to increase as search-and-rescue teams reached the area.\n\nThe quake late Sunday hit a series of towns in the province of Kunar, near the city of Jalalabad in neighboring Nangahar province. The 6.0 magnitude at 11:47 p.m. was centered 17 miles east-northeast of the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It was just 5 miles deep. Shallower quakes tend to cause more damage.\n\nThe Kunar Disaster Management Authority said in a statement that at least 250 people were killed and 500 others injured in the districts of Nur Gul, Soki, Watpur, Manogi and Chapadare.\n\n\u201cRescue operations are still underway there, and several villages have been completely destroyed. The figures for martyrs and injured are changing. Medical teams from Kunar, Nangarhar and the capital Kabul have arrived in the area,\u201d said Sharafat Zaman, a spokesman for the ministry of public health.\n\nHe said many areas had not been able to report casualties figures and that \u201cthe numbers were expected to change\u201d as death and injuries were reported.\n\nNearby Jalalabad is a bustling trade city due to its proximity with neighboring Pakistan and a key border crossing between the countries. Although it has a population of about 300,000 according to the municipality, its metropolitan area is thought to be far larger. Most of its buildings are low-rise constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, and its outlying areas include homes built of mud bricks and wood. Many are of poor construction.\n\nJalalabad also has considerable agriculture and farming, including citrus fruit and rice, with the Kabul River flowing through the city.\n\nA magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2023, followed by strong aftershocks. The Taliban government estimated at least 4,000 people perished.\n\nThe U.N. gave a far lower death toll of about 1,500. It was the deadliest natural disaster to strike Afghanistan in recent memory.",

      "text": "Magnitude 6.1 earthquake strikes Turkey, collapsing buildings\n- Share via\nISTANBUL \u2014 A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck Turkey\u2019s northwestern province of Balikesir on Sunday, causing about a dozen buildings to collapse, an official said. At least one person was trapped in the debris of a collapsed building.\nThe earthquake, with an epicenter in the town of Sindirgi, sent shock waves that were felt as far as 125 miles away in Istanbul, a city of more than 16 million people.\nInterior Minister Ali Yerlikaya told the nationwide NTV broadcaster that five people, including an elderly woman, were rescued from a collapsed building in Sindirgi, while rescuers were trying to reach a sixth person trapped inside.\nSeveral houses collapsed in the nearby village of Golcuk, Sindirgi Mayor Serkan Sak said. The minaret of a mosque also tumbled down in the village.\nTurkish Health Minister Kemal Memisoglu said on X that four people were being treated at the hospital. None of them was in life-threatening condition, he said.\n\u201cOur hope is to get through this without any loss of life,\u201d Ahmet Akin, the mayor of Balikesir city, the provincial capital, told HaberTurk news channel.\nTurkey\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Management Agency said the earthquake was followed by several aftershocks, including one that was magnitude 4.6, and urged citizens to not enter damaged buildings.\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a statement wishing all affected citizens a speedy recovery.\n\u201cMay God protect our country from any kind of disaster,\u201d he wrote on X.\nTurkey sits atop major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent.\nIn 2023, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake killed more than 53,000 people in Turkey and destroyed or damaged hundreds of thousands of buildings in 11 southern and southeastern provinces. An additional 6,000 people were killed in the northern parts of neighboring Syria.\nElsewhere, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck off Guatemala\u2019s southwestern coast Saturday. There were no reports of significant damage or injuries.\nThe quake occurred about 60 miles south-southwest of Champerico, Guatemala, at a depth of six miles, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nPeople on social media reported shaking in Guatemala City, the capital, and other areas. The quake also was felt in parts of southern Mexico.\nEarthquakes are common in Guatemala. The Central American country is on a major fault zone that serves as the boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates."

      "text": "Moroccans sleep in streets for third night as rescuers seek survivors of deadly quake\n- Share via\nAMIZMIZ, Morocco \u2014 People slept in the streets of Marrakech for a third straight night as soldiers and international aid teams in trucks and helicopters began to fan across remote mountain towns hit hardest by a historic earthquake.\nThe disaster left more than 2,100 people dead \u2014 a number that is expected to rise \u2014 and the United Nations estimated that 300,000 more people were affected by Friday night\u2019s magnitude 6.8 quake.\nAmid offers from several countries, including the United States and France, Moroccan officials said Sunday that they were accepting international aid from just four countries: Spain, Qatar, Britain and the United Arab Emirates.\n\u201cThe Moroccan authorities have carefully assessed the needs on the ground, bearing in mind that a lack of coordination in such cases would be counterproductive,\u201d the Interior Ministry said in a statement.\nWhile some foreign search-and-rescue teams arrived Sunday as an aftershock further unnerved Moroccans already in mourning, other aid groups poised to deploy grew frustrated waiting for the government to officially request assistance.\n\u201cWe know there is a great urgency to save people and dig under the remains of buildings,\u201d said Arnaud Fraisse, founder of Rescuers Without Borders, who had a team stuck in Paris waiting for the green light. \u201cThere are people dying under the rubble, and we cannot do anything to save them.\u201d\nHelp was slow to arrive in Amizmiz, where a whole chunk of the town of orange and red sandstone brick homes carved into a mountainside appeared to be missing. A mosque\u2019s minaret had collapsed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe,\u2019\u2019 said villager Salah Ancheu, 28. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the future is. The aid remains insufficient.\u201d\nThe National Weather Service issued a high surf advisory for large swaths of the coast and nearby islands through Monday evening.\nResidents cleared rubble from the main unpaved road leading into town, and people cheered when trucks full of soldiers arrived. But they pleaded for more help.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t ambulances, there aren\u2019t police, at least for right now,\u201d Ancheu said.\nThose left homeless \u2014 or fearing more aftershocks \u2014 slept outside Saturday, in the streets of the ancient city of Marrakech or under makeshift canopies in Atlas Mountain towns such as Moulay Brahim, among the hardest hit. The worst destruction was in small, rural communities that are hard for rescuers to reach because the roads that snake up the mountainous terrain were covered by fallen rocks.\nThose areas were shaken anew Sunday by a magnitude 3.9 aftershock, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether it caused more damage or casualties, but it was probably strong enough to rattle nerves in areas where buildings have become unstable and residents feared aftershocks.\nIn a region where many build bricks out of mud, Friday\u2019s earthquake toppled buildings not strong enough to withstand such a temblor, trapping people in the rubble and sending others fleeing in terror. A total of 2,122 people were confirmed dead and at least 2,421 others were injured \u2014 1,404 of them critically, the Interior Ministry reported.\nMost of the dead \u2014 1,351 \u2014 were in Al Haouz district in the High Atlas Mountains, the ministry said.\nFlags were lowered across Morocco, as King Mohammed VI ordered three days of national mourning starting Sunday. The army mobilized specialized search-and-rescue teams, and the king ordered water, food rations and shelters to be provided to those who lost their homes.\nHe also called for mosques to hold prayers Sunday for the victims, many of whom were buried Saturday amid the frenzy of rescue work nearby.\nMorocco, which said Sunday that it would accept aid from four countries, has not made an international appeal for help as Turkey did in the hours after a massive quake this year, according to aid groups.\nNonetheless, aid offers poured in from around the world and the U.N. said it had a team in Morocco coordinating international support. About 100 teams comprising 3,500 rescuers are registered with a U.N. platform and ready to deploy in Morocco when asked, Rescuers Without Borders said. Germany had a team of more than 50 rescuers waiting near Cologne-Bonn Airport but sent them home, news agency DPA reported.\nA Spanish search-and-rescue team arrived in Marrakech and headed to rural Talat N\u2019Yaaqoub, according to Spain\u2019s Emergency Military Unit. Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares said in a radio interview that Moroccan authorities requested help.\nIn France, which has many ties to Morocco and said four of its citizens died in the quake, towns and cities have offered more than $2.1 million in aid. Popular performers are collecting donations.\nThe epicenter of Friday\u2019s quake was near the town of Ighil in Al Haouz province, about 45 miles south of Marrakech. The region is known for scenic villages and valleys tucked in the High Atlas Mountains.\nDevastation gripped each town along the High Atlas\u2019 steep and winding switchbacks, with homes folding in on themselves and people crying as boys and helmet-clad police carried the dead through the streets.\n\u201dI was asleep when the earthquake struck. I could not escape because the roof fell on me. I was trapped. I was saved by my neighbors who cleared the rubble with their bare hands,\u201d said Fatna Bechar in Moulay Brahim. \u201cNow, I am living with them in their house because mine was completely destroyed.\u201d\nThere was little time for mourning as survivors tried to salvage anything from damaged homes.\nKhadija Fairouje\u2019s face was puffy from crying as she joined relatives and neighbors hauling possessions down rock-strewn streets. She had lost her daughter and three grandsons ages 4 to 11 when their home collapsed while they were sleeping less than 48 hours earlier.\n\u201cNothing\u2019s left. Everything fell,\u201d said her sister, Hafida Fairouje.\nThe Mohammed V Foundation for Solidarity was coordinating help for about 15,000 families in Al Haouz province, including food, medical aid, emergency housing and blankets, the state news agency MAP quoted the organization\u2019s head, Youssef Rabouli, as saying after he visited the region.\nRescuers backed by soldiers and police searched for victims in collapsed homes in the remote town of Adassil, near the epicenter. Military vehicles brought in bulldozers and other equipment to clear roads of rocks that crumbled off mountainsides, the state news agency MAP reported. Ambulances took dozens of wounded from the village of Tikht, population 800, to Mohammed VI University Hospital in Marrakech.\nIn Marrakech, large chunks were missing from a crenelated roof, and warped metal, crumbled concrete and dust were all that remained of a building cordoned off by police.\nTourists and residents lined up to donate desperately needed blood. Jalila Guerina said she ran to help when she learned of the need because of her duty as a Moroccan citizen.\n\u201cI did not even think about it twice,\u201d she told the Associated Press, \u201cespecially in the conditions where people are dying, especially at this moment when they are needing help, any help.\u201d\nIn the market, stray cats clambered over piles of stones and wooden bars, but shoppers were scarce at stalls set up under umbrellas by food and souvenir vendors.\nThe quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 when it hit at 11:11 p.m., lasting several seconds, the U.S. Geological Survey said. A magnitude 4.9 aftershock hit 19 minutes later, it said. The collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates occurred at a relatively shallow depth, which makes a quake more dangerous.\nIt was the strongest earthquake to hit the North African country in more than 120 years, according to the USGS, which has records dating to 1900, but it was not the deadliest. In 1960, a magnitude 5.8 quake struck near the Moroccan city of Agadir, killing at least 12,000. That quake prompted Morocco to change construction rules, but many buildings, especially rural homes, are not built to withstand such temblors.\nIn 2004, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake near the Mediterranean coastal city of Al Hoceima left more than 600 dead.\nFriday\u2019s quake was felt as far away as Portugal and Algeria, according to the Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere and Algeria\u2019s Civil Defense agency."

He said he saw hundreds of people standing on the streets.\nThe situation was similar in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on the border with Afghanistan, where people were seen standing outside their homes and offices.\nPakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif in a statement said he asked disaster management officials to remain vigilant to handle any situation.\nZabihullah Mujahid, the main spokesperson for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, tweeted that the Ministry of Public Health had ordered all health centers to be on standby.\nThe region is prone to violent seismic upheavals. A magnitude 7.6 quake in 2005 killed thousands of people in Pakistan and Kashmir.\nLast year in southeastern Afghanistan, a 6.1 magnitude quake struck a rugged, mountainous region, flattening stone and mud-brick homes. Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers put the total death toll from the quake at 1,150, with hundreds more injured, while the U.N. offered a lower estimate of 770.\nAssociated Press writers Rahim Faiez, Riaz Khan and Abdul Sattar contributed from Islamabad, Peshawar, and Quetta, Pakistan, respectively."
