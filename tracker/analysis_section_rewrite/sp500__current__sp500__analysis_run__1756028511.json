      "feedback": "Strengths: the draft correctly centers the Intel stake as the near‑term (0–3 weeks) driver and pulls from Bloomberg (ID: XQWTVR71K) to ground the numbers (10% stake, about $11B, and references to 9.9% fully diluted and ~15% on full vesting) and the governance concern around state influence. Key edits to elevate to world‑class quality: restructure into a tight, dated 0–3 week timeline that traces a clear causal chain from the policy signal to corporate actions to price reaction; replace generic framing with explicit, testable catalysts and invalidation points; quantify the uncertainty with probability weights or ranges anchored to the source (e.g., “initial stake ~10% with passive voting; vesting could lift near 15% if milestones met”); define immediate/near‑term catalysts (term sheet confirmation, vesting schedule published, any voting assurances or board governance clarifications, and management commentary on CAPEX/Supply‑chain decisions); specify reaction function (how Intel’s CAPEX optics and supplier choices would plausibly move the stock in 0–3 weeks under base/bull/bear scenarios); add explicit invalidation criteria (no official term sheet or public terms within X days, vesting stalled, or policy stance shifts) and practical monitoring beats (vest schedule progress, CAPEX/guidance updates, White House/Treasury statements, and any subsequent government‑backed onshoring signals); ensure strict use of the cited source: XQWTVR71K, and avoid importing non‑source assumptions or conflicts; include three micro‑scenarios with plausible price paths and key thresholds to watch (e.g., ifIntel CAPEX guidance shifts higher/lower by a defined band, if vesting completes vs. delays); and keep the write‑up directly aligned to the horizon by foregrounding near‑term policy/intel capital‑allocation dynamics rather than longer‑term geopolitical debate.",
