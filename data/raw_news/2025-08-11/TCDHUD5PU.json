  "description": "Myles Garrett was nabbed by police for speeding,",
  "content": "Myles Garrett was nabbed by police for speeding, according to multiple reports published on Monday.\n\nThe Browns\u2019 star defensive end was stopped by Strongsville police for going 100 mph in a 60 mph zone shortly after 2 a.m. on Saturday, according to public records, and occurred in the hours after the Browns returned from Carolina and their first preseason game.\n\nVideo obtained by TMZ of the stop showed an officer pulling over the six-time Pro Bowl while he was driving a gray 2014 Ferrari, with the interaction being cordial.\n\nGarrett was given a $250 ticket that can be paid without having to go to court, or he would have to appear in court on Thursday.\n\nCleveland.com reported that the Browns were aware of what happened and it will be addressed while the team is in Philadelphia for joint practices with the Eagles on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nGarrett has been cited eight times for speeding since the Browns took him No. 1 overall in 2017 and he had been involved in a serious crash in 2022 when he flipped the car he was driving.\n\nThe ticket comes after rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders had been cited for speeding twice over the course of 12 days.\n\nIt led to Browns general manager Andrew Berry calling it \u201cnot smart\u201d and \u201csomething that we\u2019ve addressed with him\u201d when he spoke with reporters the second day of training camp.\n\n\u201cHe understands the implications, he understands the consequences,\u201d Berry said of Sanders. \u201cI think the thing is it\u2019s not just about yourself. It\u2019s not just about having a joy ride, it\u2019s not just about driving a car really fast, but it\u2019s about the fact that you can endanger other people. It\u2019s about the fact that if a deer or someone cuts out in front of you, like your reaction time. It\u2019s just dangerous and it\u2019s not something that we want our guys to be doing. It\u2019s not something that they should be doing.\u201d",

Cops Say He Went 100 MPH in 60 Zone\nMyles Garrett isn't just quick getting to the quarterback -- he's also allegedly got speed behind the wheel ... 'cause the former Defensive Player of the Year was cited for driving 100 MPH in a 60 zone hours after the Cleveland Browns' first preseason game on Friday.\nAccording to court records, 29-year-old Garrett was pulled over around 2:00 AM on Saturday morning ... not too long after Shedeur Sanders and Co. handled the Carolina Panthers in Charlotte with a 30-10 effort. Garrett did not suit up for the contest.\nThe citation, obtained by TMZ Sports, states Garrett was cruising in a gray 2014 Ferrari in Strongsville when he was pulled over.\nGarrett was issued a citation for speeding ... and has a court date set for Thursday, which just so happens to be the same day as a joint practice against the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles.\nSanders had his own issues on the road this offseason -- he got written up twice for speeding in just a matter of days ... but said he has since learned to be more responsible.\nGarrett was also involved in a single-car rollover crash in 2022 ... when officers stated he was driving 65 MPH in a 45 zone.\nHe suffered minor injuries as a result of that accident."

      "text": "Myles Garrett was cited for speeding at least six times before scary crash\nBrowns star Myles Garrett was believed to be speeding at the time of his crash and was issued a citation by police, TMZ Sports reported on Thursday.\nAnd Garrett has been cited for speeding at least six times before he was involved in a single-car crash earlier this week that landed him in the hospital, according to court records obtained by WKYC.\nThe 26-year-old defensive end was driving back from the Browns\u2019 facility on Monday when he swerved to avoid an animal on the road, according to NFL Network\u2019s Tom Pelissero. He wound up overcorrecting and ended up flipping his car multiple times.\nWKYC reported that Garrett has been pulled over for speeding at least six times since joining the Browns as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. In several of those instances, Garrett was driving over 100 miles per hour, the records show.\nAlmost exactly a year prior to the date of this week\u2019s crash \u2013 between Sept. 24 and 25 in 2021 \u2013 Garrett was pulled over twice in a 24-hour period, first for driving 120 MPH and then for going 105. Per the report, he was fined $267 and $287 for the citations.\nIn another instance in May 2020, he was cited for going 100 MPH in a 65 zone, and was also charged with reckless operation of a motor vehicle and violating a turn signal. He pled guilty to speeding and had the other charges dropped, paying another fine of $308.\nAdvertisement\nPer the report, Garrett does not have an Ohio driver\u2019s license, rather one from his home state of Texas. It\u2019s unclear if the infractions were reported, or if his license was docked.\n\u201cIn theory it should be a 4-point suspension for 25 mph and over, a lot of times that can be negotiated downwards with local prosecutors and there may be favoritism getting played for people of prominence,\u201d attorney Adam VanHo told WKYC.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about Mr. Garrett\u2019s situation because he does have the out-of-state license, whether or not those were cited under local codes, whether those were pled down, whether they were accurately added into the computer system.\u201d\nGarrett was discharged from the hospital on the same day of the crash. He was diagnosed with shoulder and biceps strains and was set to undergo additional tests.\nHe has yet to be officially ruled out of Sunday\u2019s game against the Falcons and has returned to the Browns team facility, but as not practiced."
