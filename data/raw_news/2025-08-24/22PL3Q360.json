  "title": "Is Ford Stock a Millionaire Maker?",
  "description": "Investors don't have to look hard to find reasons not to own this business.",
  "content": "\u2022 Ford\u2019s long history, which spans more than 120 years, has made it a symbol of American industry.\n\u2022 One of the biggest criticisms of Ford\u2019s operations is that demand will always be cyclical, as sales will ebb and flow with the economy.\n\u2022 The stock is cheap, and the dividend yield is high, but investors won\u2019t achieve huge returns.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Ford Motor Company \u203a\n\nFord (NYSE: F) is a rare business because it's been around for so long. Having been founded in 1903, the automaker has been an important part of the American economy. And its ongoing relevance shows just how successful it has been in its industry.\n\nThis auto stock is having a great year thus far. As of Aug. 19, it's up 17% in 2025. But can Ford turn its investors into millionaires over the long term? Here's what you should know about the Detroit car company.\n\nLooking at Ford's business under the hood\n\nWith a history that spans more than 120 years, Ford has built up brand awareness simply from being around for such a long time. This brand recognition is also supported by the fact that the company's F-series pickups have been the best-selling trucks in the U.S. for 48 straight years. That's an unbelievable track record.\n\nHowever, I think a deeper look at this company will reveal that it's not a high-quality operation that investors will want to own for a long time. There are some key reasons why.\n\nFord isn't going to post strong revenue growth consistently. Unit volumes were up 14.2% in the U.S. in the second quarter (ended June 30), thanks to significant demand during Ford's employee-pricing program to boost sales amid trade and tariff uncertainties. This pace isn't sustainable. Between 2014 and 2024, Ford's top line increased at a compound annual rate of just 2.5%, a trend that seems likely to continue going forward.\n\nThe global auto industry is very mature in the sense that unit volumes won't increase in any meaningful way on a yearly basis. Ford is making a push into electric vehicles, a part of the industry with potential, but this specific segment posted a $1.3 billion operating loss in Q2.\n\nCyclicality is another reason that investors should tread with caution. Cars are huge buying decisions for consumers, as opposed to being small, repeat purchases. This makes Ford's demand highly sensitive to economic forces. If there's a mild downturn or even a severe recession, sales could face significant pressure.\n\nAs a result, Ford's low profitability, as demonstrated by its Q2 adjusted operating margin of 4.3% and adjusted return on invested capital of 10.1%, will take a hit. In fact, it wouldn't be a surprise to see the business post a net loss in an adverse economic scenario. Ford's profitability leaves much to be desired, and it's yet another reason this isn't a great company.",

      "text": "The automotive industry is huge and very visible. Almost everyone knows automotive brands, and most people have an opinion about the best new cars and trucks on the market.\nBecause of that visibility, automotive stocks have gotten lots of interest from investors for decades. We\u2019ll look more closely at automotive stocks and the best ways to invest in them.\nTop car stocks\nTop car stocks of 2025\nSome of the best-known automotive stocks are:\n| Automotive company | About |\n|---|---|\n| Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Investors know this automaker as a longtime market leader in pickup trucks and commercial vehicles, with operations all over the world. Ford is now investing in electric and automated vehicles to help it maintain that lead. However, relatively high interest rates have held back EV growth in recent years, and Ford is focusing on reducing costs and EV capacity to try to make its EVs profitable. |\n| Ferrari NV (NYSE:RACE) | This small Italian automaker is known for its expensive sports cars and years of racing success. Ferrari\u2019s strong brand and its long waiting list give it great pricing power and luxury-level profit margins. |\n| Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) | The pioneering maker of \u201cpremium electric vehicles\u201d has grown to be the world\u2019s most profitable EV automaker, and it dominates the U.S. EV market. Investors clearly expect great things from CEO Elon Musk and his team, and that includes ongoing EV sales, robotaxis, and full self-driving (FSD) technology. |\n| Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) | Formed in 2021 by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, this automaker's brands include Jeep, Ram, Dodge, Opel, Vauxhall, and Peugeot. It also owns the Fiat, Alfa Romeo, and Maserati brands, and it has strong operations in Europe and South America, as well as the U.S. |\n| Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY) | Volkswagen is one of the best-selling automakers outside the U.S. Its portfolio of brands includes VW, Skoda, and SEAT, plus the Audi, Lamborghini, Porsche, and Bentley luxury brands. |\n| Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) | Established in 1937, the Japanese automotive giant's portfolio of brands includes Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu, and Hino. The power of its brand and its global footprint make Toyota the largest car brand in the world in terms of sales. |\n| General Motors (NYSE:GM) | Owner of the GMC, Buick, Chevrolet, and Cadillac brands, GM is the largest car company in the U.S. in terms of sales. |\nThe auto industry\nThe auto industry\nYou\u2019ll find the following types of stocks within the automotive industry group:\n- Automakers, which manufacture cars, trucks, and sport utility vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs)\n- Suppliers of auto parts, from seats and spark plugs to complex electronic systems, tires, and batteries for electric cars\n- Auto dealer groups\n- Auto parts retailers\nEvaluating an automotive stock\nHow do you evaluate an automotive stock?\nAutomotive stocks are part of the consumer durables sector. This sector includes companies that make products intended to last for more than a few years, such as washing machines, dishwashers, furniture -- and cars and trucks.\nBefore investing in automotive stocks, it\u2019s important to understand how economic cycles affect automotive companies and how these companies work to maximize profits and stay competitive during good and bad economic times.\nThe auto sales cycle\nUnderstanding the auto sales cycle\nAutomakers and their suppliers are cyclical stocks, meaning their profits rise and fall with consumer confidence. It\u2019s easy to see why: When businesses and consumers are worried about the economy, they postpone buying new vehicles.\nAuto sales\u2019 cyclicality matters to investors because:\n- Automakers have high fixed costs that include factories, tooling, logistics networks, and labor contracts. These bills have to be paid no matter how many cars are sold.\n- Automakers and suppliers also need to invest in product development to make sure they have a steady stream of competitive new products.\n- High costs and steady spending mean profit margins in the automotive industry tend to be low, even during good economic times.\n- When sales slump, as in a recession, automotive companies\u2019 profits fall sharply -- putting future product spending and future competitiveness at risk.\nOne way to avoid the cyclicality of the sector is to buy stocks exposed to the replacement market, such as auto parts retailers or auto parts manufacturers that sell primarily to the secondary market.\nCash reserves\nCash reserves\nMost automotive companies sharply cut future product spending during the 2008-09 recession. The few that didn\u2019t, like Ford and Hyundai (OTC:HYMTF), had fresh products in their showrooms when the recovery began and were able to gain market share.\nThat was an important lesson for the industry. Now most global automakers tend to keep substantial cash reserves so they can keep investing to develop new products through recessions.\nOne interesting development during the COVID-19-induced recession was that many automakers decided to forgo investment in traditional internal-combustion engines in favor of EVs.\nMany automotive companies also pay dividends to their shareholders. Some automakers plan to use their cash reserves to continue to pay dividends during a recession.\nUnderstanding financial statements\nHow do you understand car companies\u2019 financial statements?\nFor the most part, automotive companies\u2019 financial statements aren\u2019t too hard to decipher. Here are three things to know:\n- Auto investors tend to look at operating income, or EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), as well as operating or EBIT margins (calculated by dividing profits by total revenue) and cash flow, to track an automotive company\u2019s financial performance. These include the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping vehicles, as well as research and development expenses (which can be very high in the automotive industry), while excluding interest costs and taxes less directly related to the company\u2019s ongoing performance.\n- Automakers will often provide adjusted figures that exclude the impact of one-time charges and gains such as write-offs and tax windfalls, which are useful for understanding the underlying performance of the business. (Note that one-time charges and gains can be important too.)\n- Many automakers have subsidiaries that are finance companies, providing loans and leases to customers and dealers. They can make automotive financial statements confusing for investors. To help, most automakers provide debt and cash flow figures specific to their core automaking businesses, often called \u201cautomotive\u201d or \u201cindustrial\u201d numbers. You can use those to understand a car company\u2019s debt and for comparisons between automakers.\nCompetition\nCompetition in the car industry\nGenerally speaking, the automaker with the newest products will get the highest prices and the biggest profits. Automakers must constantly invest to be sure they have a steady flow of new products in the pipeline.\nVirtually all automakers and many parts suppliers are also making big investments in future technologies such as EVs, extra safety features, and autonomous driving systems. Most experts believe those technologies will be necessary for automakers if they are to stay competitive in the not-too-distant future.\nElectric vehicles\nElectric vehicles\nSome exciting opportunities in the next few years will involve manufacturers of electric and hybrid electric vehicles. These are new and different, and most analysts expect them to largely displace internal-combustion vehicles over time.\nEV companies might see high growth, which is also exciting for investors. But it\u2019s important to remember that the processes involved in developing and manufacturing EVs aren\u2019t all that different from those used by makers of traditional internal-combustion vehicles. That means EV manufacturers face high costs, just like traditional automakers.\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that all the major traditional automakers are introducing electric vehicles of their own, and the competition in this segment of the market is fierce.\nThat competition has intensified as a combination of relatively high interest rates has slowed demand growth at a time when many carmakers have released new EV and hybrid models. As such, the main focus over the last year or so has been on cutting costs and reducing capacity where necessary.\nRelated investing topics\nAre automotive stocks for you?\nAre automotive stocks for you?\nAutomotive stocks can be important contributors to your investment portfolio. And because they rise and fall with consumer confidence, they can be useful indicators that economic trouble -- or a recovery -- may be on the way.\nIn addition, buying into an automotive maker means taking a positive view on the company's long-term hybrid and electric vehicle strategy. That's become harder to judge as relatively high interest rates slowed the rate of growth of EV unit sales and negatively impacted pricing as competition intensifies.\nFAQ\nAutomotive Stock FAQ\nWhat is the best automotive stock to buy?\nInvestors are willing to pay a premium for car companies with powerful electric vehicle brands, such as Tesla, and are discounting traditional internal combustion engine manufacturers. While the car industry is low-growth in terms of unit sales, the winning stocks will ultimately be those that are relevant to the transition to hybrid and electric vehicles.\nWhich is the fastest-growing auto stock in the world?\nWhat car companies are on the stock market?\nGiants like Toyota, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis own multiple brands. Other well-known brands with U.S. listings include Tesla, Honda (NYSE:HMC), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), VinFast (NASDAQ:VFS), Nio (NYSE:NIO), Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID), and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV). Lesser-known car companies such as NWTN (NASDAQ:NWTN) and Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNYW) are also listed on the U.S. market.\nWhat car companies are on the S&P 500?\nTesla, Ford, and General Motors are all members of the S&P 500 index."
