  "title": "From Lamborghinis to jail: Ex-LAPD cop accused of crypto heist with reputed Israeli mob figure",
  "description": "The former officer, Eric Halem, was already under investigation over allegations that he ran an insurance fraud scheme.",
  "content": "Beyond his day job as an LAPD officer, he was juggling several lucrative side hustles, business records and court filings show.\n\nPrivate security. An app for aspiring actors trying to land auditions. And an exotic car rental company, Drive-LA, that was gaining a following among rappers, influencers and executives.\n\nBut Halem\u2019s comfortable life soon began to unravel. He left his full-time position with the LAPD after coming under internal investigation, according to records submitted as part of a lawsuit. Earlier this year, state authorities charged him with insurance fraud.\n\nThen, a few weeks ago, L.A. County prosecutors accused him of masterminding a home invasion robbery with a man with reputed ties to the Israeli underworld \u2014 part of what authorities say is a growing trend of criminals targeting victims for their cryptocurrency profits.\n\nHow Halem, 37, became embroiled with one of his alleged co-conspirators, Gaby (sometimes spelled \u201cGabby\u201d) Ben, remains a mystery.\n\nBen, who has twice been convicted of fraud, was a close business associate of Moshe Matsri, or \u201cMoshe the Religious,\u201d whom authorities describe as an L.A. leader of the Israeli underground who had long operated in the San Fernando Valley and had ties to the Abergil crime syndicate, according to court filings.\n\nIn the early morning hours of Dec. 28, 2024, Halem, Ben and Mishael Mann, 20, made their way into an apartment building in Koreatown, LAPD Robbery-Homicide Det. Guillermo De La Riva wrote in a sworn declaration in favor of denying Halem\u2019s bail.\n\nPierre Louis, 26, had arranged to meet up with the victim for a \u201cdigital currency transaction,\u201d which was a ruse to allow the three other men to enter the building and wait for the victim to return, De La Riva wrote.\n\nThe men handcuffed the victim and a second person, De La Riva wrote, ordering them at gunpoint to transfer money from a cryptocurrency account and fleeing with $300,000 worth of cryptocurrency, cash and jewelry.\n\nDe La Riva said he believed that after Halem\u2019s arrest, other alleged victims might come forward.\n\nWhen LAPD detectives arrested Halem earlier this month, they obtained search warrants for the $2.1-million home he had recently moved into in Porter Ranch, a scenic neighborhood in the Santa Susana foothills. They also reportedly recovered at least one of his guns from the home of his former police partner.\n\nHalem, who went by Ben professionally, has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping and robbery and remains in Men\u2019s Central Jail after a judge denied his application for bail. His attorney, George G. Mgdesyan, declined to comment, saying he hadn\u2019t yet reviewed the evidence against his client.\n\nHalem has also pleaded not guilty in the state insurance fraud case. Ben, 51, is jailed on a federal immigration hold in Florida.\n\nLouis, Mann and another defendant, Luis Banuelos, have pleaded not guilty to felony charges. Their attorneys declined to comment.\n\nAs LAPD detectives investigated the kidnapping and robbery, they took a closer look at Halem\u2019s side businesses, according to two department sources \u2014 including whether his startup funding came from organized crime and whether his companies were a front for money laundering. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.\n\nIn recent years, business was taking off at Drive-LA, which boasted a fleet of rare luxury vehicles for rent, including a 2020 Bentley Continental GT and a Lamborghini Urus, and had nearly 60,000 Instagram followers. With glowing media coverage and venture capitalists opening their checkbooks, Halem planned to open a second location in Phoenix.\n\nHe was co-hosting a podcast for car enthusiasts, and former associates told The Times that a reality show based on his life was in the works. On social media, he cultivated the image of a carefree young entrepreneur, with photos of himself posing on the steps of a private jet, at a Formula 1 race and courtside with NBA superstars Dwight Howard and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\nHalem launched an app called kaypr in 2017 that matched aspiring actors \u201cto available roles,\u201d allowing them to audition remotely from anywhere in the world. For a security firm where he had a leadership role, he worked \u201cmusic festivals, celebrity details, and large-scale events.\u201d Among his clients was action film producer Randall Emmett, who has faced fraud claims and allegations of abuse toward women. Emmett has denied the allegations.\n\nIn a blog post, Halem described himself as a thrill seeker who has always chased \u201cspeed, precision, and a little bit of calculated chaos.\u201d\n\nAccording to an online biography, Halem grew up in Los Angeles and attended UC Riverside before joining the LAPD. He spent nearly half his 13 years on the force as a training officer and was qualified as a sharpshooter.\n\nHis last assignment was at West Valley Division, which patrols areas featured in crimes involving suspects with ties to Israeli organized crime, including the wealthy enclave of Encino. Several former colleagues who spoke with The Times described Halem as a solid if unremarkable officer.\n\nIn 2014, Halem was injured during an encounter with a suspect in the West Valley area who had holed up inside an apartment and pelted officers with objects. An LAPD review board found that Halem\u2019s decision to fire a beanbag shotgun at the suspect was in line with department policy.\n\nBy the time he left the LAPD in 2022, Halem was pulling in $188,500 in salary and benefits, according to the Transparent California database.\n\nAnd his other businesses were apparently far more lucrative than his day job. In an interview with Internal Affairs detectives investigating him for insurance fraud, Halem boasted that he was raking in more than $1 million in profit annually from Drive-LA, according to a department source who reviewed the Internal Affairs file and was not authorized to discuss the matter.\n\nHalem was also targeted by numerous lawsuits, one of which cited a WhatsApp conversation in which an LAPD sergeant said that Halem\u2019s \u201cbusiness smells dirty\u201d and suggested that there were other LAPD officers who were \u201cinvolved in his business dealings.\u201d\n\n\u201c[If] there is any misconduct on their part they will be held accountable,\u201d the sergeant wrote in the WhatsApp exchange, referring to the other officers.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the LAPD investigated whether other officers were involved. The department did eventually clear Halem of the insurance fraud allegations. But his alleged misdeeds had come to the attention of the state Department of Insurance, which charged both him and his brother, Jacob Halem, with misrepresenting details in a roughly $200,000 insurance claim related to a Bentley crash in January 2023. The case is pending.\n\nAfter leaving his full-time LAPD job, Halem worked as an unpaid reserve officer. In March, he was stripped of his police powers after he was charged in the insurance fraud case.\n\nBen, who moved to the San Fernando Valley from Israel as a young adult, worked in real estate and was a partner at his late mother\u2019s restaurant.\n\nFederal prosecutors described him as a flashy high roller with an affinity for high-end watches. His Israeli mafia connections allowed him to launder money through Jewish-owned businesses across the Valley, prosecutors alleged in documents filed in the case.\n\nBen was deported after each of his fraud convictions, federal court records show. In one of the cases, prosecutors alleged that he orchestrated a so-called bust-out scheme, recruiting people to open bank accounts on his behalf in exchange for a small fee.\n\nHe and his brother, Amin Ben, were also accused of defrauding senior citizens by entering their homes disguised as HVAC repairmen and then photographing their driver\u2019s licenses and bank statements.\n\nBased on wiretaps described in a federal sworn affidavit, federal investigators believed the brothers could move freely in and out of the country, despite their legal troubles, because of Amin Ben\u2019s connection to an official at the Israeli Consulate who was \u201cable to facilitate and issue travel documents.\u201d Prosecutors also alleged that the brothers were captured on a recording threatening to kill the Israel-based family of an LAPD detective investigating one of the federal cases.\n\nThe check-cashing business that Ben ran with Matsri, the alleged Israeli crime boss, in an Encino strip mall was a front for alleged fraud schemes, according to a declaration filed in court by an LAPD Major Crimes detective.\n\nInvestigators determined that the pair bought more than 230 airline tickets, worth more than $600,000, using phone credit card approval codes and then resold the tickets to local Israelis at discount rates, an FBI agent wrote in a sworn affidavit.\n\nWhen they arrested Ben and Matsri in October 2010, authorities seized 16 high-end watches and a handgun from Ben\u2019s home.\n\nIn 2015, Matsri was sentenced in a separate federal case to 32 years in prison for drug trafficking, money laundering and extortion.\n\nLand records show that Ben was living in a glitzy mansion in the Hollywood Hills, where neighbors said they often saw him driving a black Rolls-Royce. The mansion\u2019s owner sued him after he stopped paying rent for five months, eventually racking up a $150,000 tab, court records show.\n\nBen continued to live at the residence until moving out in March.",

      "text": "Southwest changing its extra-seat policy for plus-size travelers: \u2018Heartbreaking\u2019\n- Share via\nA change in Southwest Airlines\u2019 seating policy has many advocates for the plus-size community saying the shift will create financial burdens and other barriers for this segment of the traveling public.\nFor the last decade, Jen McLellan has been a customer of Southwest Airlines because its \u201ccustomer of size\u201d policy allowed her to ride with dignity, she said in a post on Instagram.\nCurrently, travelers who \u201cencroach upon neighboring seats\u201d are encouraged to purchase an extra seat in advance of the flight to ensure it will be available. Upon request, Southwest has refunded the cost of the additional seat after travel.\nThe airline recently announced that, effective Jan. 27, the refund is no longer guaranteed.\nA refund will be issued if the following conditions are met:\n- When the flight departs, it has at least one open seat.\n- The traveler purchased two seats in the same fare class; both tickets need to be choice, choice preferred, choice extra or basic.\n- A refund request is made within 90 days of the date of travel.\nAlaska is the only other major U.S. airline that offers a refund on an extra seat, as long as there\u2019s at least one open seat on the flight at takeoff.\nSouthwest\u2019s current policy was something McLellan cherished, the traveler said in her post. It eased her mind that she wouldn\u2019t be the next \u201cviral video of someone upset about sitting next to the fat passenger.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t just about her own comfort or that of her neighbors; she said it was an issue of accessibility.\nFliers in the plus-size community knew that, on top of the guaranteed refund, customers could easily reserve an empty seat and were met with compassion from customer service agents.\nThe customer-of-size policy \u201chelped ease what too often feels humiliating,\u201d McLellan wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s why the recent changes are heartbreaking.\u201d\nThe change comes as Southwest is updating many of its policies to prepare its operation, employees and customers for the switch to assigned seating next year, the airline told The Times in a statement.\nSouthwest estimated that fewer than 1% of its customers request an extra seat annually. The airline had about 140 million passengers in 2024.\n\u201cTo ensure space, we are communicating to customers who have previously used the extra seat policy they should purchase it at booking,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said.\nAirplane seats are not one-size-fits-all. In fact, fewer than half of travelers can reasonably fit in seats, according to FlyersRights, a nonprofit that advocates for the rights and interests of airline passengers, USA Today reported.\nIn 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration was tasked with setting a minimum passenger-seat size by Congress, but airline trade groups were opposed, and in 2023, a U.S. appeals court ruled that the seats may be uncomfortable but aren\u2019t dangerous.\nAt this time, there isn\u2019t a minimum seat-size requirement.\nThe width of passenger seats vary from 15.5 to 19 inches, depending on the airline and the section of the plane.\nSouthwest made incremental accessibility changes for plus-size travelers over the course of 15 years, said Tigress Osborn, executive director of the National Assn. to Advance Fat Acceptance. The incident that, in part, pushed the airline in this direction, she said, was its removal of film director Kevin Smith from a flight in 2010 because the captain deemed Smith a \u201csafety risk\u201d to other passengers.\nAfter the changes, the airline \u201cstaked this claim as, \u2018We are the airline where plus-size passengers are welcome,\u2019\u201d Osborn told The Times. The attitude was, \u201cWe\u2019re going to figure out a way to make this work so that you can fly, and even if that means working with other passengers,\u201d she added, referring to volunteers who would board a later flight to free up a seat.\nRemoving the refund guarantee on top of the addition of assigned seating feels like a huge reversal, she said.\nOsborn and other advocates believe the policy changes are going to come at the cost of plus-size travelers who may not be able to afford two seats.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been this economic downturn, and people are way more conservative with their money. So I think what this does is make people question if they should [fly] or not,\u201d said Jeff Jenkins, founder of Chubby Diaries.\nIt\u2019s also going to add to the anxiety of figuring out all the logistics surrounding travel for the community, Jenkins said.\nNow travelers will have to think about whether they can reserve two seats next to each other with Southwest\u2019s implementation of assigned seating. That stacks onto other concerns of travel including needing a seat belt extender, where to purchase affordable plus-size clothes if luggage is lost, the distance from the airport entrance to the terminal, and seat accessibility on public transportation.\nOsborn said she felt the change was due to companies generally making financial cutbacks and \u201cthe overall spirit in corporate America of, \u2018The things we said were important like diversity and inclusion don\u2019t have to be important in the same way anymore.\u2019\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\nLatinos make up more than half of Oxnard\u2019s 202,000 residents, and they have long taken pride in helping to build this sprawling city by the sea.\nConstructed around the same agriculture fields where Cesar Chavez organized migrant laborers before establishing the United Farm Workers of America, Oxnard is a place where Latino influence is omnipresent \u2014 from music festivals to eateries.\nAt City Hall, officials have made it a priority to protect the area\u2019s immigrant residents and workforce \u2014 whether that involves bolstering tenant rights against predatory landlords, or joining a civil rights lawsuit against indiscriminate raids.\nBut a summer of immigration sweeps has fueled distrust in the community, and put city officials on the defensive.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s crackdown has sparked street protests, as well as complaints that city officials need to be more proactive and forceful in the face of federal immigration enforcement.\n\u201cTensions are high in the community right now and relations are being strained,\u201d said Lucas Zucker, co-executive director of Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, the same group behind new tenant protections. \u201cIt takes a lot of work to build trust with the immigrant community and any law enforcement or government.\u201d\nAt a City Council meeting last month, speakers criticized police and city leaders for not doing enough to help the immigrant population. Some called for legal action.\n\u201cOur community is under attack by the federal government,\u201d Veronica Miranda, 65, told the council that evening. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you can do, but I\u2019m going to ask you to do something \u2014 a gesture, can we look at an eviction moratorium?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not able to stop the federal government,\u201d said Pastor Greg Runyon. \u201cI don\u2019t fault you for that \u2026 but you do have a weapon \u2014 it\u2019s a bully pulpit.\u201d\nVanessa Valdez, an attorney and resident, didn\u2019t mince her words.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here to serve us, if you refuse to act, we will make sure you do not get reelected,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will hold every one of you accountable for what happens under your leadership, starting with the death of Jaime Alanis Garc\u00eda.\u201d\nCity officials said they understand the anger, but they insist they are doing all they can to fight the federal action.\nAlexander Nguyen, city manager for Oxnard, said it was particularly alarming given the city\u2019s efforts to build trust with immigrant communities.\n\u201cThe Police Department has worked really hard over the last two decades to establish a tremendous amount of trust and respect, and open communication,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the federal actions, it clearly can drive a wedge between specific communities and their police departments.\u201d\nSince January, federal immigration agents had been parachuting into the town and surrounding communities. The agents, successfully at times, entered farms and packinghouses to apprehend immigrant workers living in the country illegally. They stopped people in their vehicles and on the street, sometimes loitering around schools.\nSome of the raids were captured on video and shared on social media, including one in May, when federal agents detained a man at a gas station, leaving his two sons behind. One of the sons was 19, but did not have a license to drive.\nThe following month, amid harvest season, federal agents were caught on video as they chased a farmworker across a strawberry field.\nAs the raids continued, community frustration grew. That was especially the case for the Police Department, whose officers often stood between agents and demonstrators.\nIt didn\u2019t help that federal authorities would drive to the police station to report that they were being followed, prompting police officers to contact immigrant rights advocates, who have been alerting residents of the operations and documenting them.\nAnd because federal agents often dressed in plain clothes, there were a few cases in which activists mistakenly followed police officers home from work. In some cases, sting operations by a police task force have been complicated by people mistaking them for Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.\nBut things came to a head last month when the largest cannabis operator in the state \u2014 Glass House Brands \u2014 was the target of two separate worksite operations in Camarillo and Carpinteria.\nThere were hundreds of workers at the Camarillo property, many of them Oxnard residents, who were detained and taken away for deportation. It was during this operation that Garc\u00eda fell three stories from a greenhouse while trying to evade federal agents.\nGarc\u00eda died from his injuries two days later.\nThe Department of Homeland Security said that Garc\u00eda was not among those being pursued and that federal agents called in a medevac for him.\nThe operation led to an hours-long standoff between demonstrators and federal agents, who used less lethal ammunition to keep the crowd at bay. A few demonstrators responded by throwing rocks at federal vehicles as they left the area. At least one man was captured on video shooting a handgun at agents.\nThe operation also included members of the National Guard, prompting the National Immigration Law Center to file a Freedom of Information Act to ascertain the military\u2019s role in the operation.\n\u201cThe deployment of the U.S. military in our communities is not just unnecessary, it is yet another fear tactic this administration is using in its concerted assault on immigrant communities and our democratic traditions,\u201d said Benjamin R. Farley, special counsel at NILC, in a written statement.\nThe situation only worsened when federal agents showed up at a local hospital where injured farmworkers had been taken, prompting Oxnard police to respond.\nOxnard Police Chief Jason Benites said the officers were requested by the Fire Department, not ICE. However, their presence drove a narrative that officers were helping federal agents. He said the officers were there to ensure that ambulances could access the emergency room.\nTwo days after the operation, a federal judge would order immigration authorities to stop detaining people based on their ethnicity or occupation. The order covers seven counties: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo.\nIn her ruling, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found sufficient evidence that agents were using race, language, a person\u2019s vocation or the location they are at \u2014 such as a car wash, Home Depot, swap meets or a row of street vendors \u2014 to form \u201creasonable suspicion.\u201d\nFrimpong said reliance on those factors, either alone or in combination, does not meet the requirements of the 4th Amendment. Her order prohibits agents from relying solely on those factors to establish reasonable suspicion to detain people.\nFarmworkers have long been a part of life of Oxnard. The vast coastal plain grows most of the nation\u2019s celery, along with beans, strawberries, onions and peppers, according to UC Davis data.\nChavez, the father of the farm labor movement, spent a year in the town organizing workers and registering voters.\nThe city had its share of racial strife over the years, with some Latino migrants feeling they were mistreated by a white majority that also owned the farms where they worked. But by the early 1990s, Latinos became the majority and rapidly remade political and cultural life.\nOver the next three decades, it became a magnet for Latino residents and saw its population nearly double. A thriving Latino middle class was also established.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until 2010 \u2014 after a massive scandal brought government reforms \u2014 that Latinos were significantly represented in city affairs.\nThe first change came when voters elected Carmen Ramirez, the first Latina on the Oxnard City Council. She would later become the first Latina on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. An environmentalist, she along with environmental groups and residents worked together to stop the construction of a power plant. They would also address other environmental issues.\nAnother change came in 2018, when the city moved to district elections, allowing for Latino representation in government to grow.\n\u201cI think both things made the City Council more racially diverse, but also more accessible to grassroots community members who wanted to run for office, because it\u2019s a lot easier to run in a small district, especially in a small town,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cAnd so I think that that has helped bring in some pretty progressive and community-oriented folks to the City Council, who have moved forward ... some really important policies.\u201d\nImmigration raids are not new here. In the 1970s and 1980s, the federal government launched roundups targeting Mexican and Central Americans.\nOxnard was still trying to recover from racial strife at the time of the crackdown. Much of the tension was related to school segregation and police brutality. The latter led to violent riots when residents of La Colonia, a Latino neighborhood where Chavez once lived, rose up.\nBut under Police Chief Robert Owens, the department tried to shift the way it conducted police work, pushing officers to build a closer relationship with the community.\nWhen Benites joined the department more than 30 years ago, he was told that officers never got involved in federal immigration operations and that when it came to the immigrant population, everyone was treated equally and that the only time you\u2019d arrest someone was for committing a crime.\nPolice departments have walked a fine line between being peacekeepers and crimefighters, a distinction that has been difficult to make at times amid controversial shootings and past enforcements.\nIn the summer of 1978, Oxnard police officers and Ventura County sheriff deputies found themselves standing between members of the Ku Klux Klan and demonstrators. The Klan attempted to show the film \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d at the town\u2019s community center in an effort to recruit new members, but their arrival led to a standoff that turned violent.\nResidents at the time accused Oxnard police officers of protecting members of the Klan. At least one officer who was there during the riot said he and others were there to keep the peace and prevent both sides from hurting each other.\nNow, officers find themselves being accused of helping federal agents.\nZucker, the co-executive of Cause, said he doesn\u2019t believe the Police Department is working with the federal government, but he does believe there is some soft cooperation. He said when federal agents go to the station and request police assistance, that same response is not provided to activists who are trying to determine what agency the federal agents work for.\n\u201cI think from the Police Department\u2019s perspective, I think what they say is: \u2018We would do this for anyone.\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s just a perception in the community that it never seems to be the case that the local police are helping the protesters or immigrants in those confrontations, and it always just so happens they seem to be making it easier for ICE to do that.\u201d\nIn order to preserve its relationship with the community, Benites said the department has reached out to immigrant rights advocates to discuss any issues. An officer also takes questions from the community on a local radio program \u2014 a long-standing tradition started many years ago and later expanded to include the Spanish media by Mayor Luis McArthur, a former Oxnard police officer.\nMost recently, Benites launched a podcast to discuss issues such as immigration operations and to clarify the department\u2019s role.\nEven before Trump was sworn into office, Benites and other police chiefs in Ventura County put out a joint statement saying they do not assist or take part in federal immigration operations. They underscored their roles are limited and often subjected to investigations targeting organized crime such as drug organizations or human trafficking operations.\nDespite the outreach, he said, it\u2019s not always guaranteed that people will listen.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can do,\u201d Benites said.\nThe raids have also had an impact on the relationships between city officials and social justice groups.\nThe groups want the city to stand with the immigrant community and have asked that the city allocate money for a legal defense fund to help families that have been affected by the immigration raids.\nMcArthur, the mayor, said the city has plans to meet with all groups to address ongoing immigration issues in the city.\nMcArthur said he\u2019s hoping to keep the bridges that he and his predecessors spent years forging with local groups, but it has been difficult with the high number of operations taking place."

He rocked back and forth in his chair as U.S. District Court Judge S. James Otero explained how extensive wire taps played throughout the trial portrayed a man \u201cwilling to use force to help undercover agents who he believed were Colombian drug traffickers to attempt to collect debts owed to them.\u201d\nThe sentence came after a federal jury found Matsri guilty in October 2014 of a series of crimes, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine and conspiracy to commit extortion.\nMatsri was a known crime figure in the San Fernando Valley with deep ties to the Abergil organized crime family, according to prosecutors. The organization is based in Israel but conducts business around the world.\n\u201cAs CEO of this multi-faceted criminal business, [Matsri] used his extensive, sophisticated network to move over $660,000 in cash he believed were drug proceeds across international borders and across the United States, in exchange for over $57,000 in commissions,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum filed with the court.\nMatsri\u2019s lawyer, Dean Steward, said he would file an appeal. He described how Matsri, the father of five, was a fixture in his community and a deeply religious and charitable man.\n\u201cA visit every couple of weeks isn\u2019t like having dad home,\u201d said Steward after the proceedings. \u201cSo it\u2019s devastating.\u201d\nOtero was not swayed. He noted that it\u2019s not surprising for a figure like Matsri to live a \u201cdouble life.\u201d Matsri had been on pre-trial release and was wearing an ankle bracelet when he committed many of the crimes, Otero said.\n\u201cThe only way to deter him it seems is to incarcerate him,\u201d Otero said from the bench.\nThe case began in 2010 as an investigation into the Sinaloa cartel, Otero said. Matsri has been in custody since July 2013, when authorities from several state and federal agencies, with cooperation from police in Netherlands, Belgium, Canada and Israel, arrested him and several co-defendants.\nFor more California news, follow @boreskes."

The San Francisco Chronicle has described Hundred Acre as a \u201ccult Cabernet\u201d winemaker.\nWhile the cause of the fire remains under investigation, a source with knowledge of the discussions at Hundred Acre told The Times that the investigators were looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard had sparked the major fire.\nThe Pickett fire ignited Aug. 21 at 2343 Pickett Road just outside of Calistoga, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. That address is part of the Hundred Acre property, Singer confirmed.\nSinger declined to comment on reports about the discarded ashes. However, he made clear that there was no controlled burn on the property that might have gotten out of control.\nAs of Sunday evening, the fire near Calistoga had scorched more than 6,800 acres and was 11% contained, fire officials said.\nOfficials with Cal Fire, which is leading the fire investigation and response, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Pickett fire remained at just under 7,000 acres as of Thursday, with 33% containment, according to Cal Fire reports. It broke out amid a major heat wave, prompting evacuation orders and warnings, including many that remain in place.\nThe blaze has not grown in several days, but Cal Fire reported Thursday that \u201clarge fuels continue to smolder within the fire perimeter as firefighters work to construct control lines within steep, rugged terrain.\u201d\nWhile the extent of damage to vineyards and properties around the region hasn\u2019t yet been assessed, no structures have been reported destroyed or damaged. Singer said Hundred Acre\u2019s properties have had road and infrastructure damage, but no buildings or vineyards were affected.\nThere are more than 2,500 people assigned to the fire response, according to Cal Fire."

      "text": "- Share via\nRandall Emmett was fuming.\nIt was the producer\u2019s first time in the director\u2019s chair, and things weren\u2019t going well. For the last half-hour on the set of \u201cMidnight in the Switchgrass,\u201d the filmmaker and his colleagues had been trying to persuade Bruce Willis to kick open a door.\nA voice coming through the actor\u2019s earpiece coached him through his lines. A stunt coordinator gently attempted to guide him. Yet, take after take, Willis did not seem to understand, according to seven crew members who were present for the late-night shoot. Emmett rose from behind the video monitor and mimed the actions, urging Willis to emulate him. When the effort failed, the director left the set in frustration, three of the crew members said.\n\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d Willis asked, searching the concerned faces of the below-the-line team.\nThat night, Emmett\u2019s then-fiancee, Lala Kent, said Emmett called her crying.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d Kent recalled him saying in a call overheard by two other people. \u201cIt\u2019s just so sad. Bruce can\u2019t remember any of his lines. He doesn\u2019t know where he is.\u201d\n\u2018Die Hard\u2019 and \u2018Pulp Fiction\u2019 actor Bruce Willis ends his acting career after being diagnosed with aphasia, his family announces.\nBut in the 15 months after filming \u201cMidnight in the Switchgrass,\u201d Emmett made five more movies with Willis.\nEmmett, in a statement to The Times, denied the conversation with Kent occurred or that he was aware \u201cof any decline in Mr. Willis\u2019 health.\u201d\nOn that day in September 2020, few people outside the insular world of low-budget action filmmaking knew Willis was battling a condition that made it difficult for him to understand or express speech. But as The Times previously reported, it was an open secret on movie sets.\n\u201cOur stunt coordinator mentioned he was struggling,\u201d said Alicia Haverland, a property master on \u201cMidnight in the Switchgrass. \u201cOur first [assistant director] saw he was struggling. You would have to be blind to not see him struggling.\u201d\nIn March, his family announced he had been diagnosed with aphasia and was ending his career.\nWillis\u2019 enduring appeal had helped propel Emmett\u2019s production company, Emmett/Furla Oasis, to success; the 51-year-old producer used the Willis name and face to sell his films around the world. Since 2006, the actor has appeared in two dozen of the firm\u2019s projects \u2014 and the pace of the output heightened as Willis\u2019 health declined.\nFor years, Emmett had flourished on the margins of Hollywood, producing films that featured cameos from big-name stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone and often went straight to DVD. But by 2019, he was flirting with Hollywood glory. He\u2019d produced a couple of genuine blockbusters, and was in line to claim an Academy Award as one of the producers of Martin Scorsese\u2019s Oscar contender \u201cThe Irishman.\u201d He had easy access to private jets, friendly contacts at gossip site TMZ, and a Los Angeles Police Department officer who described himself as Emmett\u2019s \u201cbusiness and security manager.\u201d\nA year later, the walls were closing in.\nSubscribers get exclusive access to this story\nWe\u2019re offering L.A. Times subscribers special access to our best journalism. Thank you for your support.\nExplore more Subscriber Exclusive content.\nA review of hundreds of court filings and internal company records, as well as interviews with three dozen former associates, depicts an empire that is crumbling. The once-high-flying producer faces lawsuits and mounting debts, as well as allegations of abuse against women, assistants and business partners. He is accused of inappropriate behavior with women, including offering acting work in exchange for sexual favors, and of forcing assistants to conduct dangerous and illegal activity on his behalf. Through his spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, Emmett denied these allegations.\nEmmett used an array of tactics to try to keep these allegations secret, including entering into nondisclosure agreements and allegedly promising a payment of about $200,000 to a female accuser, which Emmett has denied.\nEmmett and his company now are confronting nearly a dozen lawsuits, including several from former financiers, an insurance company and a prior landlord, all clamoring to be repaid their portion of more than $25 million in outstanding loans and disputed payments. Several lawsuits accuse Emmett\u2019s company of misrepresentation and civil fraud.\nThe Writers Guild of America West won a $541,464 judgment against EFO last year after it filed a claim on behalf of writers who alleged they were shortchanged for their work on an Emmett project.\n\u201cHis normal mode of business is being sketchy,\u201d said Teresa Huang, a writer on that project. \u201cHe just spins all these plates in the air and doesn\u2019t care how they crash.\u201d\nTimes reporting has played a starring role in \u2018The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u2019 this season. Here\u2019s our guide to Erika Jayne and Tom Girardi.\nIn a statement, Emmett rejected Huang\u2019s assessment and blamed the allegations contained in this story on Kent, a reality TV star with whom he has a child. \u201cThese allegations are false and part of a now-familiar smear campaign orchestrated by Randall\u2019s ex-fiancee to sway their custody dispute,\u201d said Hofmeister. Emmett and Kent, a cast member on Bravo\u2019s \u201cVanderpump Rules,\u201d currently share custody of their child.\nWillis\u2019 attorney, Martin Singer, declined an interview request on the actor\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cMy client continued working after his medical diagnosis because he wanted to work and was able to do so, just like many others diagnosed with aphasia who are capable of continuing to work,\u201d Singer wrote. \u201cBecause Mr. Willis appeared in those films, they could get financed. That resulted in literally thousands of people having jobs, many during the COVID-19 Pandemic.\u201d\nA wheeler-dealer\nIn a town that is home to creative geniuses as well as quick-buck hustlers, Emmett occupies a lucrative niche in between. He\u2019s made more than 120 movies, most of which have been critically panned. His specialty is cranking out low-budget, high-testosterone, assault-gun-and-explosions films and recruiting stars such as Willis, Stallone, Mel Gibson and other older white men whose enduring cachet has lured investors and generated overseas sales. Although he isn\u2019t among the few movie producers who are recognizable by name \u2014 Kevin Feige, Jerry Bruckheimer, Megan Ellison \u2014 Emmett had just enough success to attract young women, aspiring actors, ambitious assistants, deep-pocketed investors and even big-name stars seduced by the promise of fame, fortune or both.\nWith his trademark five o\u2019clock shadow, black T-shirt, cargo shorts and white shell-toe Adidas sneakers, Emmett has worked overtime to hone his image as a Hollywood tough guy \u2014 a wheeler-dealer, high-stakes poker player who beats the house.\nHis parents sold insurance in his native Miami, but as a child, Emmett yearned to be in entertainment. In eighth grade, he began acting in TV commercials but was mocked for being a goofy kid who was interested in the arts.\nAfter graduating from Miami\u2019s prestigious New World School of the Arts, he went to college in New York on an acting scholarship.\n\u201cEveryone else at film school wanted to be a writer or director or actor,\u201d Emmett told The Times in 2012. \u201cI was the only one who wanted to be a producer.\u201d\nAfter graduation in 1994, he moved to Los Angeles. He landed a coveted internship with his distant cousin, Bruckheimer, the blockbuster movie producer behind \u201cTop Gun\u201d and \u201cPirates of the Caribbean,\u201d and then became an assistant at International Creative Management talent agency.\nAt 24, he got a job as Mark Wahlberg\u2019s assistant, a gig that became central to Emmett\u2019s origin story and the foundation of his career. In the actor-producer, he had a role model and a foil. In 2012, Wahlberg told The Times that Emmett once challenged him to a wrestling match. \u201cI had to body-slam him. Then he wanted it again.\u201d\n(Wahlberg\u2019s manager said he could not be reached for comment.)\nIt was as Wahlberg\u2019s assistant that Emmett began cultivating the kind of cool that HBO\u2019s \u201cEntourage\u201d \u2014 a show produced by Wahlberg and based loosely on his rise \u2014 showcased more than a decade ago. Indeed, Emmett claims to have helped inspire the show\u2019s weed-dealing driver, Turtle. (Multiple reports have noted that the character was actually based on another of Wahlberg\u2019s assistants.) Throughout his decades in Hollywood, Emmett, like the guys on that series, would flaunt luxury cars and expensive real estate, date a bevy of much younger women and party at roped-off clubs.\nEmmett found his first loyal investor in George Furla, a former stock trader and hedge fund manager who\u2019d put some money into a modeling agency and surprised Emmett by backing his 1999 buddy drama \u201cSpeedway Junky\u201d with $30,000.\nThe pair founded Emmett/Furla Films. Furla, who declined interview requests, handled the finances, while Emmett became the self-described \u201cloud and obnoxious\u201d frontman.\n\u201cIf you throw Randy out the door, he comes in the window,\u201d Emmett\u2019s film producing mentor, Avi Lerner, told The Times in 2012. \u201cIf you throw him from the window, he comes down the chimney.\u201d\nEmmett\u2019s trademark films, dubbed \u201cgeezer teasers\u201d in a 2021 New York magazine article that called Emmett \u201cHollywood\u2019s worst filmmaker,\u201d mined the box office appeal of Hollywood heroes of an earlier era. On a recent YouTube broadcast, he kidded that he isn\u2019t a B- or C-level producer: \u201cmore like H-level.\u201d)\n\u201cFor a lot of people in Hollywood, Randall is the person who can help you get the movie done,\u201d said Michael Polish, who has directed three Emmett films. \u201cHe gives people their chance, and not a lot of people in Hollywood will do that.\u201d\nEmmett\u2019s drive, and results, attracted a large investment from Dubai-based Oasis Ventures, which in 2013 acquired a one-third stake, renaming it Emmett/Furla Oasis.\nHollywood took notice of Emmett and Furla that year. Universal Pictures released their film \u201cLone Survivor,\u201d which was written and directed by Pete Berg and based on a real-life story of Navy SEALs conducting a failed military operation in Afghanistan. The film, which starred Wahlberg, was praised by critics and raked in $155 million worldwide. It gave Emmett newfound credibility after years of producing mediocre fare like \u201cMercenary for Justice\u201d with Steven Seagal.\nSuddenly, Emmett could attract big stars and hungry investors. His Instagram account shouted his ambition: @randallmogul.\nEmmett also became an unlikely savior that year for one of the industry\u2019s greatest filmmakers. Martin Scorsese had tried for 15 years to secure financing for a project about Portuguese Jesuit priests in the 17th century investigating Catholic persecution. None of the studios would touch \u201cSilence,\u201d but after a call from Scorsese\u2019s super-agent Ari Emanuel of WME, Emmett jumped at the chance.\nDuring his first meeting with Scorsese, he \u201cwas perspiring and hyperventilating,\u201d Emmett recalled during a 2014 conversation with students at New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts. \u201cAnd I just went in the room and he said: \u2018Why should I make these movies with you?\u2019 I said: \u2018Cause you\u2019re the man and I\u2019ll do whatever you f\u2014 say, basically.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018I love this kid. All right, give him the movie.\u2019\u201d\nEmmett and Furla reportedly raised half of the $46.5-million budget for the film featuring Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield, which The Times described as a \u201cmasterwork of spiritual inquiry.\u201d In exchange for backing \u201cSilence,\u201d Emmett earned a producing credit \u2014 and eventually, an Oscar nomination \u2014 on Scorsese\u2019s next film, the brooding 2019 mob epic \u201cThe Irishman\u201d for Netflix.\nScorsese\u2019s publicist said the director was unavailable for comment.\n\u2018I\u2019m not a creep, I promise\u2019\nDespite his prolific film resume, Emmett may be best known for appearing on reality television as Kent\u2019s fiance (and then ex-fiance) on the last two seasons of \u201cVanderpump Rules.\u201d\nOn the Bravo show, Emmett projected the image of a Hollywood power broker who drove a Rolls-Royce convertible and lived on Mulholland Drive. Kent told friends that he\u2019d offered to give her a Range Rover the morning after she \u201clet him hit it\u201d for the first time in 2015.\nThe couple were together for nearly six years and had a daughter before their relationship imploded. Last fall, one of Kent\u2019s fellow cast members alerted her that pictures of Emmett exiting an elevator with two young women, taken by an onlooker in Nashville, were circulating online. (Asked about the images, Hofmeister said: \u201cRandall enjoys socializing with friends. In Nashville he was hanging out with a large group of people, men and women.\u201d)\nWithin hours of the photo leak, Emmett was back in L.A, where Kent demanded that he share the contents of his phone. When he refused, she said she grabbed it away from him.\nNatasha Henstridge was watching a movie on Brett Ratner\u2019s couch when she fell asleep.\n\u201cHe ran after me, tackled me and knocked me to the ground,\u201d Kent said, echoing claims she made in her request for custody of their daughter. \u201cI used every ounce of strength to get him off of me as he was trying to pry it from my hands. \u2026 That was when I knew, for sure, that there was a lot he was hiding.\u201d\nThe Times spoke with five people who confirmed Kent told them about Emmett tackling her to the ground within days or weeks of the altercation. Emmett, however, denied a physical fight occurred. His team provided The Times with a declaration from his longtime nanny, Isabelle Morales, who said that \u201cneither was on the ground.\u201d\n\u201cI witnessed Randall and Lala fighting over his phone,\u201d Morales said. \u201cThe only physical interaction I saw was Randall taking back his phone from Lala.\u201d\nKent sought \u201cto keep her name in the press, and remain relevant in reality television,\u201d Hofmeister said in the statement.\nEmmett had good reason to protect the iPhone. It was the keeper of his secrets \u2014 the tool he is accused of using to send lewd text messages to women, hunt for sexual prospects on Instagram and email his lawyer about wiring money to women in exchange for their silence.\nThrough interviews and reviewing previously confidential documents, The Times has learned that several women have accused Emmett of pursuing them in inappropriate ways \u2014 one alleged she was offered acting work in exchange for sex \u2014 even as Hollywood began to reconsider the way its powerful men treated women.\n\u201cI used every ounce of strength to get him off of me as he was trying to pry [his phone] from my hands. \u2026 That was when I knew, for sure, that there was a lot he was hiding.\u201d\n\u2014 Lala Kent, echoing claims she made in her request for custody of their daughter\nOne woman, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, said that she was leaving a bar around midnight in 2014 when a Rolls-Royce pulled up beside her on Ventura Boulevard and a man she had never met rolled down the window. It was Emmett.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a creep, I promise. I\u2019m a movie producer, you can Google me \u2014 please Google me,\u201d she said he implored. The Times spoke with a friend of the woman who said her friend shared this account, but Emmett denied the incident occurred.\nAnother aspiring performer was just 23, with a few minor TV credits to her name, when she met Emmett. The producer, then making a string of movies with rap star Curtis \u201c50 Cent\u201d Jackson, introduced himself to her as a \u201cwell-known and established movie producer,\u201d according to a letter written to Emmett by attorney Gloria Allred.\nAllred\u2019s letter, which The Times reviewed, was dated Oct. 5, 2021, and sent to Emmett via FedEx and email. In it Allred alleges that the producer explicitly told the woman, who declined to make her name public, \u201cthat to receive acting work from [him], she would have to perform sexual favors.\u201d The letter then cites a text exchange in which Allred\u2019s client asked Emmett if she\u2019d won an acting role she\u2019d auditioned for in one of his projects.\n\u201cYes. one day of work and u need to fuckme hun,\u201d Emmett responded, according to the letter.\nHofmeister confirmed that Emmett did receive the letter but said he \u201cadamantly denies\u201d the allegations in it. Allred declined requests for comment.\nOver the next three years, Allred\u2019s client had minor roles in two more of Emmett\u2019s films.\nDuring this period, Allred\u2019s letter alleges, the woman gave Emmett massages and oral sex, allowed him to digitally penetrate her and stood nude in his office while he masturbated.\nShe complied with Emmett\u2019s requests, the letter says, because she was \u201cseeking to further her career\u201d and did not want to \u201canger an important producer in the industry.\u201d\nInterviews with multiple members of the \u201cRust\u201d crew paint an hour- by-hour picture of a cascade of bad decisions that created a chaotic set on which a lead bullet was put into a prop gun.\nWhenever Allred\u2019s client rebuffed Emmett\u2019s advances, she said, he told her he would not give her the roles they had discussed.\nThe incidents caused her to feel a \u201cdeep sense of self-loathing and self-hatred\u201d that led her to seek weekly therapy beginning in 2016, Allred said. The lawyer went on to invite Emmett to engage in \u201can expeditious confidential mediation process\u201d to avoid civil litigation.\nOn Jan. 2, 2022, Emmett was sent a settlement agreement that stipulated he would pay Allred\u2019s client about $200,000 over the course of two years. A person familiar with the situation said Emmett printed, signed and scanned that agreement, although he denied doing so.\nJust two months after finalizing the settlement, Emmett sent an unsolicited Instagram message to a 30-year-old woman in Las Vegas whose feed featured dozens of photos of herself and her boyfriend. This woman told The Times that Emmett \u2014 whom she\u2019d never met \u2014 messaged her from his account using the social media platform\u2019s \u201cvanish mode\u201d setting, which permanently deletes any text or pictures after they are seen by both users.\nAccording to a declaration filed in the custody proceedings and reviewed by The Times, Emmett asked her to \u201cf\u2014 on the dl\u201d and \u201cdo heroin and meth,\u201d among other things. She did not respond and was so alarmed, she recounted, that she used the camera from her laptop to capture the Instagram messages on her phone. She included screenshots of those images with her declaration.\nHofmeister provided proof of negative drug tests Emmett has taken as part of the ongoing custody dispute.\n\u201cHe is working hard on his sobriety and very proud that he has stayed clean for almost a year,\u201d she said.\nA person close to Emmett said there was no forensic proof Emmett sent the messages to the Las Vegas woman.\nDespite being unanswered, Emmett\u2019s DMs continued for two weeks, the Las Vegas woman said. Then she received a string of similar WhatsApp messages from an unknown number.\nShe reached out to a friend who knew a \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d cast member and confirmed that the unknown number matched Emmett\u2019s. She said she blocked his number.\n\u201cI was shocked, concerned, and afraid because Randall is a stranger to me,\u201d the woman wrote of Emmett\u2019s behavior in the court document. \u201cHis persistence despite my never responding to a single message from him is frightening.\u201d\nOffers of payment\nEmmett paid women to sign nondisclosure agreements, or NDAs, requiring them to keep mum about his intimate relationships.\nHe tried to get Kent to sign one early in their relationship, his ex-fiancee told The Times.\nIn the summer of 2016, she was about to start filming the fifth season of \u201cVanderpump Rules,\u201d and producers wanted to include her new boyfriend on the show. But their romance was a delicate subject: Emmett was still legally married to actress Ambyr Childers, though he told Kent that they were separated.\nTo figure out how to handle the subject on television, Kent said Emmett suggested that she meet with one of his attorneys, Keith Davidson, who once represented Stormy Daniels in her legal battle against Donald Trump. Kent brought her mother, Lisa Burningham, along to the attorney\u2019s Wilshire Boulevard office for one of their meetings.\nInside, Kent said Davidson put a stack of papers in front of the women: an agreement stating that Kent would receive $14,000 in exchange for keeping her relationship with Emmett a secret.\n\u201cI said: \u2018We\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d Burningham recalled, and she and her daughter left the office.\nDavidson, in a response to The Times, said attorney-client privilege prevented him from discussing the matter. A person close to Emmett said the account was inaccurate but did not provide any details.\nKent and her mother said she did not take the $14,000 offer, and Kent ended her relationship with the producer. But after his divorce with Childers was finalized in December 2017, Emmett and Kent reentered a serious relationship. They remained a couple until she learned of his alleged infidelity following the Nashville incident in October 2021.\nAfter those photos of Emmett with other women surfaced, Kent said she was suddenly bombarded with messages. Several individuals claimed that a Florida model had been having an affair with Emmett, and Kent checked out the Florida woman\u2019s social accounts.\nWhen the woman noticed that Kent had viewed her Instagram story, she called Emmett on Nov. 28 and recorded the conversation without his knowledge. The Times reviewed the recording, in which the woman fretted that Kent \u201cobviously has a lot of details if she knows my Instagram account.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of us ever having hooked up,\u201d Emmett responded. \u201cI want you to say \u2014 if she ever tries to get to you, you can say, \u2018Hey, I dated [his assistant].\u2019\u201d\nLater that day, the Florida woman texted a friend, saying she was \u201ctrying to figure out a way to leverage the whole situation to get money\u201d in exchange for \u201cmy silence.\u201d (The Times reviewed the messages.) \u201cI should say some thing like a tabloid came to me with a certain amount of money and they found proof of some sort.\u201d\nA year after an HBO documentary shed new light on sexual abuse allegations against Woody Allen, the director is releasing an essay collection.\nWithin hours, the Florida woman texted her friend that Emmett had offered her as much as $20,000 and said she would be reviewing a \u201clegal document\u201d from him regarding the payment the following day. He had already sent her \u201c$3K for no reason a few minutes ago,\u201d the Florida woman texted.\nThe Times could not determine whether Emmett or his associates made the payments to the Florida woman.\nHofmeister declined to answer The Times\u2019 inquiries about this woman, who did not return requests for comment.\nAfter this story was published, Hofmeister told Page Six: \u201cAs the Times acknowledged, there is zero proof that Randall paid her any money to sign an NDA. In fact, she said just the opposite.\u201d\nRoughly a week later, Kent subpoenaed the Florida woman in her custody battle with Emmett, requesting all text messages between the two. But, according to a Dec. 22 text to her friend, the Florida woman had \u201csigned a[n] agreement\u201d with Emmett saying she wouldn\u2019t show any of her messages, in exchange for \u201ca bunch of stuff from Randal,\u201d she wrote.\nA woman named Grace McCarthy also signed nondisclosure agreements with Emmett.\nIn May, The Times reviewed emails referencing payments from Emmett to McCarthy. She made various allegations about Emmett in an interview and said she had signed several NDAs at Emmett\u2019s behest between 2015 and 2019. She sent two of these purported agreements to The Times, one for $2,700 and another for $7,500.\nAsked to respond to McCarthy\u2019s allegations, Emmett\u2019s lawyer provided a declaration in which McCarthy retracted her statements to The Times, saying that she\u2019d told \u201ca bunch of lies to paint the worst possible picture of Randall.\u201d\nEmmett\u2019s team also provided a sworn statement from one of McCarthy\u2019s friends, Samantha Rakell, claiming that she too had lied to a Times reporter.\nIn McCarthy\u2019s initial interview with The Times, she\u2019d alleged that Emmett had mistreated Rakell.\n\u201cI want to tell the truth before my statements are published in the paper,\u201d Rakell wrote in the declaration sent by Emmett\u2019s team. \u201cBecause I allowed myself to be manipulated by Lala, I lied to Amy Kaufman to make Randall look abusive.\u201d\nBut neither Kaufman nor any Times reporter had ever interviewed Rakell.\n\u2018The Tasmanian devil\u2019\nWithin his inner circle, Emmett commanded grudging respect. Some former subordinates marveled at his hustle and salesmanship. His partner, Furla, once described Emmett as \u201cthe Tasmanian devil.\u201d\nWorking for Emmett had a certain Hollywood appeal \u2014 at first. The producer appeared to relish the role of the demanding boss who shouts to a harried assistant: \u201cGet Ari Emanuel on the phone.\u201d\nBut Emmett\u2019s subordinates also found his behavior alarming. Former employees described him as emotional and volatile. Anna Szymanska, who worked as Emmett\u2019s assistant for about a year before resigning in February, recalled an incident last year after she beat Emmett in a game of pingpong. Emmett threw the paddle so hard at a door in the office that the glass cracked.\n\u201cI was terrified, but I felt like I couldn\u2019t show my fear because I had to be better than that,\u201d said Szymanska, now 24. She provided The Times with a photo of the broken glass as well as a June 2021 invoice documenting a nearly $800 charge to replace it.\nHofmeister told The Times that \u201cRandall never threw a paddle,\u201d but then provided a sworn declaration from one of Emmett\u2019s employees acknowledging the incident occurred. \u201cRandall lost to Anna and threw a paddle. We were all laughing about it, including her,\u201d Sean Stone, Emmett\u2019s assistant-turned-executive, said in the document.\nHollywood assistants have launched a push against low pay. With the hashtag #PayUpHollywood, they are tweeting horror stories. But will the industry notice?\nNumerous former assistants said Emmett demanded 24/7 assistance, frequently called them disparaging names and asked them to transport drugs, deliver payments to women and put large expenses on their personal credit cards.\nMost of Emmett\u2019s staff were men. Several assistants said they were instructed by Emmett\u2019s former lieutenants to avoid selecting women for internships and other positions; one said the reason was \u201cto protect them from Randall.\u201d In the Wilshire Boulevard office, where framed photos of a nude Marilyn Monroe decorated the walls, \u201cbro\u201d culture prevailed, several assistants said.\nSzymanska said in an interview that her boss told her he didn\u2019t like working with women because he felt they weren\u2019t \u201cemotionally strong.\u201d (Emmett denied the allegation.)\nOne night in July 2021, she said he summoned her to his house for an urgent errand around 10 p.m. His blood pressure was low, he said, and he needed coconut water and Muscle Milk to raise his sodium levels.\nDrinks in tow, Szymanska arrived at Emmett\u2019s house about an hour later to find her boss, fully visible through the glass entryway of his home, \u201clying naked on a couch.\u201d\n\u201cI became extremely uncomfortable and disturbed,\u201d she wrote in a declaration filed in the custody proceeding. \u201cWhen I entered, Randall nonchalantly grabbed a pillow to cover his penis.\u201d\nThree months later, she recounted the experience over Facebook Messenger while venting about her job to a friend from her native Poland.\nIn the messages \u2014 which The Times translated from Polish \u2014 Szymanska wrote she had been harassed \u201csexually, mentally, physically and psychologically\u201d during her six months on the job \u2014 including when she saw Emmett \u201clying on the couch naked.\u201d She had also been subjected to seeing him urinate \u201cwith the door open\u201d and \u201che has his back hair shaved in the office on the carpet,\u201d she wrote in the message.\nHofmeister denied these allegations and said Emmett only urinated with the door open when taking a drug test, a requirement in the custody dispute, and \u201cnever intended anyone other than the drug tester to witness him in the bathroom.\u201d She also questioned Szymanska\u2019s credibility, citing a declaration the former assistant gave in support of Emmett\u2019s custody request in January. Szymanska said she made the earlier declaration because Emmett was hounding her about it for months.\n\u201cI was scared about my immigration status, because I needed the job to keep my visa. So I felt obligated,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gave me a talk where he told me what to say about what a good dad he was.\u201d (Hofmeister said Emmett \u201cdid not pressure Anna or suggest topics to cover in her declaration.\u201d)\nNearly three months later, after she left EFO, Szymanska provided a second declaration \u2014 this one in support of Kent \u2014 because she felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to share her \u201cconcerns about what his children are exposed to when left with him for long periods of time.\u201d\nSeveral of Emmett\u2019s former subordinates said they went into debt trying to placate the producer. He asked interns and assistants to cover his expenses \u2014 thousands of dollars in charges \u2014 with their own personal credit cards. (A person close to Emmett said that expenses incurred by assistants \u201cfor Randall\u2019s personal life, in addition to corporate expenses,\u201d were reimbursed.)\nAbout a month into his job at EFO, Martin G\u2019Blae was directed by an EFO executive to send Emmett\u2019s poker chips and his custom poker table to Puerto Rico the following day, according to a text exchange reviewed by The Times. The table weighed 100 pounds, so G\u2019Blae and an intern called FedEx Freight, and G\u2019Blae put the $1,250 charge on his personal card. (The Times reviewed the receipt, bank charge and a photo of the package. A person close to Emmett said G\u2019Blae was reimbursed.)\nThe former assistant said he then hopped on a flight to Puerto Rico to set up the table. Shortly after his arrival, Emmett sent G\u2019Blae and another assistant to his $1,300-a-night suite at the Dorado Beach Ritz-Carlton to retrieve an item from the room\u2019s safe. When the combination didn\u2019t work, G\u2019Blae said he summoned the hotel staff.\n\u201cA security team comes in and they open the safe and then they all just turn away,\u201d G\u2019Blae said. \u201cI look in and see a big bag of cocaine.\u201d\nG\u2019Blae was petrified by the prospect of being caught with drugs.\n\u201cI was in shock \u2014 and disbelief,\u201d he said, noting that, as a Black man, he felt he was being put at an unacceptable risk. \u201cWe had a 30-minute car ride where I was constantly paranoid about getting pulled over by the cops.\u201d\nA second former assistant who accompanied G\u2019Blae that night corroborated the account, saying the drugs looked \u201cbricked up, like they were off a cocaine kilo.\u201d\n\u201cI had seen Randall do lines off a poker table at Sundance [Film Festival] the month before,\u201d this assistant said. \u201cAnd while we were in Puerto Rico, Randall had me carry his drugs around in my sock during a night out and pull them out for him whenever we got to a casino. He offered me some, but I said no.\u201d\nHofmeister declined to comment on the 2020 allegation or discuss alleged past drug use, but emphasized that Emmett has been sober since October 2021.\nEntertainment industry assistants, who for decades have worked long hours with little pay, have in recent years demanded improved working conditions, inspiring a Twitter hashtag #PayUpHollywood.\nThe Times spoke with 10 former assistants; several said they were grappling with the lingering emotional toll of working for Emmett. Some said they\u2019d experienced severe depression, prescription drug abuse and bouts of heavy drinking.\n\u201cRandall was different from being just a mean boss. He made people do dangerous things \u2014 and illegal things,\u201d G\u2019Blae said in May. \u201cYou had to be his punching bag \u2014 and his mule.\u201d\nG\u2019Blae joined EFO in February 2020, when he was 26. He figured he would work hard for a year and earn a few movie credits, boosting his fledgling entertainment career.\nInstead, throughout his nearly eight-month tenure, he said he was excoriated when Emmett\u2019s 2018 Rolls-Royce got stolen, even though Emmett had instructed G\u2019Blae to park the car on Mulholland Drive rather than in his driveway, according to text messages. He got blamed when Emmett\u2019s goldfish died. (Text messages show G\u2019Blae tried to explain that Emmett\u2019s nanny said the fish was fine. \u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d Emmett texted back. \u201cI told you to get doctor ... and now my fish is dead.\u201d)\nG\u2019Blae also got chewed out for buying Emmett\u2019s favorite daily treat \u2014 a $2.25 Toll House ice cream sandwich \u2014 in bulk from Costco rather than the convenience store next door. Emmett tossed one in the trash, saying it wasn\u2019t \u201cfresh.\u201d A person close to Emmett denied these allegations, but a second assistant who was there confirmed the ice cream sandwich incident.\nIn June 2020, G\u2019Blae was tasked with arranging a romantic stay for his boss and Kent at the Beverly Hills Hotel.\nEmmett had asked him to decorate a suite with rose petals, so G\u2019Blae rushed to a Melrose Avenue florist and spent $350 for two bags. Upon arrival at the hotel, a guest services manager let G\u2019Blae into the room, which a second assistant had reserved. G\u2019Blae sprinkled the petals around the room and used them to spell \u201cL A L A\u201d on the bed.\nHe left the room key with a concierge and went home. But when Emmett arrived at the hotel restaurant for a candlelit dinner with Kent, he texted G\u2019Blae demanding the room key. G\u2019Blae replied that it was at the front desk. \u201cI can\u2019t go to front desk,\u201d Emmett texted. G\u2019Blae headed back to the hotel, where staff members told him that Emmett needed to physically provide his credit card. After he relayed this information to Emmett, the producer responded:\n\u201cStop \u2026 Dude my card is maxed,\u201d Emmett responded. \u201cHandle it.\u201d\nForty minutes later, Emmett asked: \u201cMartin where is the key?\u201d\nFearing he might lose his job, G\u2019Blae tried to put the charge \u2014 more than $1,200 \u2014 on his debit card. His bank rejected the transaction. So G\u2019Blae called his mom and begged for money. His mother, Amy Kamara, said she was rattled by the call \u2014 it was nearly midnight in Rhode Island \u2014 but she quickly transferred the money into her son\u2019s account because she feared he was in some danger. (The Times reviewed a copy of his debit charge rejection and the hotel invoice.)\nA source close to Emmett said: \u201cMartin knew he always had the option to contact George Furla to cover expenses, including Randall\u2019s personal ones. Apparently Martin did not use this option.\u201d\nG\u2019Blae, who left after working on \u201cMidnight in the Switchgrass\u201d in September 2020, said he has yet to be fully reimbursed for his expenses. By November 2021, after Hurricane Ida had damaged the roof of his family\u2019s home in Rhode Island, and G\u2019Blae needed money for repairs. He called EFO\u2019s former bookkeeper and began liking a series of old text messages he\u2019d sent about the charges to highlight what he believed he was still owed.\nG\u2019Blae didn\u2019t realize that Emmett was also on the text thread. G\u2019Blae sought reimbursement as Emmett was dealing with other issues: His former girlfriend, Kent, was demanding custody of their daughter; Allred was pressing for a settlement; and EFO\u2019s bank accounts were frozen.\nG\u2019Blae\u2019s phone lit up.\n- Share via\nVoice notes from Randall Emmett to former assistant Martin G\u2019Blae\n\u201cMartin, if you want $50,000 to produce this movie that starts next week, let me know,\u201d he said in the first of four voice notes shared with The Times. \u201cI\u2019m just sad, man. I just really need somebody who could be a friend to me right now.\u201d\nOffended that Emmett was now calling him a friend, G\u2019Blae declined the offer.\nHofmeister in a statement said that G\u2019Blae \u201chas only recently criticized Randall, despite previously speaking about him in glowing terms \u2014 even after leaving EFO.\u201d G\u2019Blae said he had been pleasant because he wanted to leave on good terms.\nSeveral former assistants said they grew weary of the alleged abuse and Emmett\u2019s semiregular threats of termination. \u201cIf you do that again, your fired,\u201d read one typical text. Three former assistants said they also endured insulting remarks such as \u201cyou\u2019re a moron,\u201d \u201cdo something with the zits on your face,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re f\u2014 lazy.\u201d\nWhile on location in Puerto Rico, another former assistant said he was ordered to book an inexpensive hotel room for Emmett and a female companion with his own credit card.\n\u201cThe next morning, he had me go back to his actual room at the Ritz [Carlton], go into his safe and get $1,800 bucks for her,\u201d the former assistant recalled. \u201cYou feel like you have to say \u2018yes\u2019 to everything he says.\u201d\nThe subordinate delivered the payment but apparently made a math error, prompting an irate call from Emmett.\n\u201cHe said I\u2019d overpaid her by $200,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said I was sorry, but he said I was fired, told me to get my stuff and find a flight home.\u201d\nHofmeister said that Emmett \u201chas never fired anyone for mistakenly overpaying a vendor, contractor or employee\u201d and that it is \u201cfalse and misleading to claim that verbally insulting his assistants is a common practice.\u201d\nThe Times interviewed nearly two dozen Black entertainment industry voices, spanning directors, producers, writers, designers, agents and executives. They discussed racism in Hollywood, what needs to change and their frustration with years of talk and little action by powerful companies.\nSeveral past assistants said they were also intimidated by the fact that Emmett had an LAPD officer working for him. In 2019, Emmett hired Eric Halem, a 34-year-old officer at the West Valley station, as a security consultant through a referral from \u201ca member of a concierge company.\u201d Though Halem described himself in a 2019 email as Emmett\u2019s \u201cbusiness and security manager,\u201d in an interview he said he never dealt with the producer\u2019s business.\n\u201cI may have used that descriptor as a ruse or something,\u201d Halem told The Times, adding that he obtained work permits for his consulting gigs through the LAPD. He said his responsibilities included running background checks through a private investigation firm, mediating disputes and responding to threatening parties. Once, he said, he also helped orchestrate the arrest of a man who was threatening Emmett with extortion. The man was later convicted.\nHalem, for his part, described his interactions with Emmett\u2019s staff as \u201cpositive.\u201d\n\u201cI never introduce myself to anyone as a LAPD officer. I always introduce myself as a security consultant,\u201d said Halem, who appeared in small roles in \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d and \u201cMidnight in the Switchgrass.\u201d\nIn January 2020, Halem sent an invoice to Emmett noting that he was to receive a $1,000 tip, \u201cper Randall,\u201d for a \u201cTMZ video.\u201d Asked what the video entailed, Halem responded: \u201cI have a lot of clients. I don\u2019t recall the specific incident.\u201d\nSteve Small, a longtime agent and business affairs executive, joined Emmett\u2019s operation last August after knowing the producer for 20 years. In an interview, Small disputed allegations of an abusive environment, saying that he \u201cnever saw any unprofessional behavior.\u201d\nIn a separate statement, Small, who now serves as film and television president of Emmett\u2019s new company, Convergence Entertainment, said, \u201cDuring my tenure with the company I have never witnessed any verbal insults from Randall to any employees.\u201d\nHe said Emmett and Furla have filled a niche in Hollywood by providing opportunities for aging stars and movies for their fans.\n\u201cRandall and George are trying to create an opportunity for artists and content creators \u2014 actors, writers and directors \u2014 in a very challenging environment for independent filmmakers,\u201d Small said. \u201cAnd I give these guys credit for that.\u201d\nEmmett and Furla\u2019s business model relied heavily on tax credits and paying millions to aging stars and then pushing their films in foreign markets including the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, where audiences remained eager to see American he-men smash bad guys. The bigger the name, the bigger the foreign presales, which meant more investment and more money that everyone \u2014 actors, agents and producers \u2014 could grab.\nAccording to internal emails, Willis\u2019 standard fee was $2 million for two days\u2019 work.\nActors\u2019 contract details:\nOther actors demanded even more, amounts that though not unheard of, were unusually high, according to Hollywood veterans.\nAl Pacino reaped $6 million for working up to 19 production days on \u201cAmerican Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally\u201d in September 2018. Gibson was paid $2 million the following year to act for 10 days in \u201cForce of Nature\u201d and $2 million more to serve as its executive producer, according to internal documents. In August 2020, Stallone\u2019s agent at Creative Artists Agency wrote an email to Emmett approving \u201cthe proposed $8M for four days of work\u201d on an undisclosed project. Through their publicists, Pacino, Gibson and Stallone declined to comment.\nThese actors\u2019 deals included private plane travel, five-star hotel accommodations, a trailer, personal drivers, assistants, their choice of hair and makeup artists and on-set security. Robert De Niro\u2019s deal stood apart.\nThe 78-year-old \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d star demanded $11 million to spend a week in Puerto Rico early last year to film \u201cSavage Salvation,\u201d an Emmett-helmed film about a recovering opioid junkie seeking revenge.\nFees for De Niro, who played a tough cop, ate up half the film\u2019s budget. De Niro\u2019s deal, reviewed by The Times, also included an all-expenses-paid weeklong vacation for his family at Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve. And, if De Niro wanted, EFO was to have the Gulfstream IV jet whisk him and his family off to \u201can additional Caribbean location for an additional vacation up to two weeks.\u201d The family\u2019s expenses, up to $100,000, would be paid by EFO. De Niro\u2019s publicist said the actor had no comment.\nDe Niro\u2019s talent agency, CAA, has long embraced Emmett and Furla. Most of the top talent in EFO movies, including Willis, were represented by CAA, which declined comment.\nEFO made hefty payments to actors even as it struggled to meet payroll and pay for crew meals and other costs on location, according to three film crew members.\nThe investors\nWealthy investors eager to play in Hollywood were attracted by Emmett\u2019s list of film credits and proximity to power.\nEFO\u2019s financiers over the years have been an eclectic mix. They included film studio Lionsgate and two London film financing groups, Ingenious Media and the Fyzz Facility. A decade ago, investors with ties to the Russian oil industry provided tens of millions of dollars for Emmett\u2019s films.\nInternal records show that Emmett also turned to multimillionaires outside of the entertainment world, including Jacksonville, Fla., entrepreneur Thomas M. Leonard; a former Hollywood tequila bar owner/real estate investor/filmmaker, Ted Fox; grandson of the late billionaire founder of Conair Corp. and actor Sergio Rizzuto; and, until about 2015, the head of an Atlanta-area healthcare staffing firm, Richard L. Jackson.\nIn recent years, Emmett\u2019s most generous investor has been Meadow Williams, an actress who primarily had small parts in shows like \u201cMurder, She Wrote,\u201d until she became romantically involved with the founder of Nature\u2019s Plus vitamins, Gerald Kessler.\nWilliams, who inherited a reported $800 million when her 80-year-old husband Kessler died in 2015, has invested heavily in Emmett\u2019s projects.\nBoth she and her boyfriend, Swen Temmel, typically would be assured roles in the film projects she helped to finance, according to contracts reviewed by The Times. Williams did not respond to requests for comment.\nWilliams also allowed Emmett to shoot films on her 554-acre ranch near Santa Ynez, the former retreat of McDonald\u2019s founder Ray Kroc.\nIn turn, Emmett and Furla tried to give their wealthy benefactor the star treatment, allowing Williams to pursue her acting dreams. She starred in the Emmett- and Furla-produced \u201cAmerican Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally,\u201d a story about a U.S.-born broadcaster who dished Nazi propaganda in Germany during World War II.\nWilliams invested $9 million in the project, according to internal documents; much of it went toward securing Pacino as her co-star.\nBut the veteran actor had some qualms, according to an email he wrote to Emmett in June 2019. After shooting wrapped on the $18-million film, Pacino complained that Williams was interfering with director Michael Polish\u2019s creative process.\nEmmett insisted that Williams needed to have \u201cher voice heard\u201d because \u201cshe wrote the check.\u201d\nPacino countered. \u201cMy thought Randall is very simple. She is not a professional. ... Someone has to say back off a second dear, we\u2019re completing the film still, take a look when it\u2019s ready,\u201d according to a 2019 email.\nThe actor suggested adding another shooting day \u201cto help [Williams] give a better performance.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s do this Randall. I\u2019m not going for the A\u2019s or the B\u2019s. I\u2019m going for something between C and B,\u201d Pacino wrote to Emmett. \u201cI don\u2019t like Ds. And, as long as you put the effort in with what you know about filmmaking and Michael too I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to a B-. And that\u2019s good enough for me, if it\u2019s good enough for you.\u201d\nPacino\u2019s publicist said the actor had no comment. \u201cRandall would never comment on his personal interactions with his actors,\u201d Hofmeister said.\nAnother longtime business partner of Emmett\u2019s, 50 Cent, turned on him in April 2019.\nEmmett and Jackson\u2019s relationship went back to 2008, when the producer put the performer in the 2008 film \u201cRighteous Kill\u201d with De Niro and Pacino. The two formed their own production company, Cheetah Vision, and in 2014 became producers on \u201cPower.\u201d\nBut in April 2019, Jackson announced on Instagram that Emmett had owed him $1 million and mocked his relationship with then-fiancee Kent. \u201cMoney by Monday Randall,\u201d Jackson demanded on Instagram.\nEmmett pleaded for Jackson\u2019s mocking posts to stop, but mistakenly called him \u201cFofty\u201d instead of \u201cFifty.\u201d Jackson just posted Emmett\u2019s texts.\nThe feud ended a few days later as a result of a settlement agreement, which was reviewed by The Times. Jackson agreed to delete the negative remarks and Emmett had to post a public apology, which also noted that Emmett had paid the debt.\nEmmett was required to stay clear of Jackson on a different Starz crime drama the pair produced, \u201cBMF: Black Mafia Family.\u201d The agreement did permit Emmett to attend the show\u2019s red carpet premiere, as long as he remained 100 feet from Jackson and refrained from joining group photos.\nThrough his publicist, Jackson declined to comment; Hofmeister said Emmett would not \u201cdiscuss the business matters of others.\u201d\nMonths later, Emmett learned \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d cast members talked about the \u201cFofty\u201d dust-up during the show\u2019s taping. Emmett reached out to Ron Meyer, then-vice chairman of NBCUniversal, which owns \u201cVanderpump\u201d network Bravo, and begged him to quash the segment.\n\u201cIf they mention him anywhere in this show \u2026 the antics will start Again which could Destroy my career,\u201d Emmett wrote in an October 2019 email.\nIn exchange for the favor, Emmett told Meyer he would thank him \u201cfor real\u201d from the Oscars stage if \u201cThe Irishman\u201d won best picture. Soon, Meyer\u2019s assistant sent an email, saying, \u201cRon would like to get\u201d six tickets reserved for the Scorsese film\u2019s premiere. Two were for his neighbor, and the rest were for private detective Anthony Pellicano. Emmett and Meyer declined to comment.\nClashes over money\nEmmett\u2019s career seemed to be soaring in 2019.\nThat fall, Netflix was releasing \u201cThe Irishman.\u201d And Emmett was swinging for the fences with his production of a $45-million time travel movie with Gibson and Frank Grillo called \u201cBoss Level.\u201d He was also putting together a TV series based on Schwarzenegger\u2019s early years in Venice Beach. \u201cThe Terminator\u201d himself was expected to have an on-screen role in \u201cPump.\u201d\nBut that spring, the facade began to crumble.\nOn March 9, 2019, Emmett and Furla received an email from a key financier with the subject line: \u201cDebts.\u201d\nIn the email, the British executive wrote that EFO owed: \u201cTOTAL $8,250,000 PLUS INTEREST. This is a serious amount of capital \u2026 I get calls every day from my investors on most of these loans \u2026 What\u2019s the plan?\u201d (A person close to the matter said much of the loan had been repaid.)\nThat October, additional financiers turned up the heat.\nCharles Auty, managing director of the Fyzz Facility \u2014 a group of wealthy British financiers who once lent money freely to EFO \u2014 had learned Emmett was coming to London for \u201cThe Irishman\u201d premiere. He suggested a meeting, but Emmett initially balked.\nIn an Oct. 10, 2019, email, Auty warned that Emmett risked sending \u201ca very dismissive and negative message to all of our investors to whom you guys owe in excess of $30 million in principal alone.\u201d Emmett needed to show up, Auty said in a follow-up email, \u201cto let the investor see you\u2019re there grinding away getting movies made.\u201d (Emmett met with the financiers, emails show. A person close to Emmett said his firm currently owes about $17 million in loan principal.)\nAuty declined to comment.\nFyzz Facility in May sued in Los Angeles County Superior Court for $10 million, alleging that Emmett and Furla used its funds without authorization, including allowing CAA to transfer $1.25 million from the loan advance without Fyzz\u2019s approval, to actor Gerard Butler\u2019s company for a movie, \u201cMexicali.\u201d But the film has not been made, and Emmett declined to comment.\nEFO has yet to file a response to the suit.\nAlso in the fall of 2019, the Schwarzenegger project, \u201cPump,\u201d was deflating.\nEmmett had hired four guild writers that year to develop scripts for a TV series loosely based on Schwarzenegger\u2019s early years in California, according to internal emails and interviews. Writers said they envisioned \u201cPump\u201d as a love letter to Venice Beach in the early 1970s and the birth of the modern bodybuilding culture. In a September 2019 meeting that included the writers and Schwarzenegger, the former California governor seemed enthusiastic. \u201cPump\u201d would showcase his immigrant story.\nHuang, one of the writers, recalled a separate September 2019 pitch session with producers. \u201cWe do the pitch and Randall loves it. He\u2019s \u2026 clapping and cheering the whole time. He was like, yeah, this is great. Now we can get Arnold on board.\u2019\u201d\nHuang was stunned: \u201cThat was when we learned that Arnold hadn\u2019t signed anything.\u201d\nThe writers said they previously had been told that Schwarzenegger and Emmett were producing the series, and that Emmett would shop it to a streaming service. That seemed odd, Huang said, because producers typically line up agreements and a buyer before producing episodes \u201cbecause it\u2019s so expensive to make television.\u201d\nBut, Huang said, \u201cwe were told Randall has these investors who just write him checks.\u201d\nJames van der Woerd had provided a $750,000 loan for \u201cPump\u201d in August 2019. A lawsuit brought by his Canadian firm, 902878 Ontario Ltd., alleges that Emmett assured him that Schwarzenegger was committed to the project and that his money would go toward the actor\u2019s fees and to hire writers.\nVan der Woerd didn\u2019t see his money again, according to his civil fraud and breach of contract lawsuit seeking $1 million. The loan was \u201cused by defendants to pay themselves exorbitant producer fees,\u201d the suit alleges. Van der Woerd declined to comment. Emmett declined to comment but disputes the claims.\nBy mid-October, writers and insiders felt the project was probably doomed when they learned Schwarzenegger had switched to United Talent Agency from CAA, which declined to comment. Martin Singer, a Schwarzenegger attorney, said the star had bowed out due to \u201cscheduling problems.\u201d\nThat November, payments to the writers stopped. One of the writers, Patrick Moss, camped out in the lobby of Emmett\u2019s Wilshire Boulevard building until one of Emmett\u2019s lieutenants, Tim Sullivan, brought down a check.\nBut finances were tight.\n\u201cWe\u2019re short about $14,000,\u201d Sullivan wrote in a group email Nov. 22, 2019. \u201cI\u2019ll put in 7 k george can put in 7 k,\u201d Emmett replied. But Furla disagreed: \u201cNot my account. I just wired money to pay efo salaries.\u201d\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, the writers still hadn\u2019t been fully paid, nor had EFO made contributions to WGA West\u2019s health and pension fund.\n\u201cHere we were, sitting in the middle of the pandemic,\u201d Moss said. \u201cThe message that [Emmett] was sending was that my family and my kids didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nThe WGA West filed for arbitration and advised its 10,000 members against working with EFO. The guild won an arbitration award against the firm that, with interest, now exceeds $588,000.\n\u201cThey have not paid a cent ... And on Instagram, you see that Randall leads this lavish lifestyle \u2014 flying in private jets, going to pickleball tournaments at La Quinta and constantly staying at these lavish resorts.\u201d\n\u2014 WGA West attorney Leila Azari\n\u201cThey have not paid a cent,\u201d said WGA West attorney Leila Azari. \u201cAnd on Instagram, you see that Randall leads this lavish lifestyle \u2014 flying in private jets, going to pickleball tournaments at La Quinta and constantly staying at these lavish resorts.\u201d\nA person close to Emmett said EFO\u2019s attempts to settle with a payment plan had not succeeded. Azari said the attempts were \u201cnothing more than bad faith legal maneuvers to try and evade\u201d the ruling against them.\nSince 2010, more than 30 lawsuits have been filed against Emmett and Furla, and a half-dozen more against Emmett. American Express sued Emmett for $393,756; the case was settled with a payment plan, court records show. Last year, Emmett repaid nearly $400,000 in debt to the IRS.\nFinanciers and fellow producers have hit Emmett and Furla with a barrage of lawsuits that allege fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract and personal enrichment at the expense of others. Emmett and Furla, who dispute the allegations, declined to comment on pending litigation.\nTwo lawsuits have raised concerns about the partners paying themselves excessive fees, including on projects that were abandoned. (Company records show that Emmett\u2019s fees in recent years were as high as $1.2 million a film.) Loans made to Emmett and Furla \u201cwere not utilized for their intended purpose,\u201d according to a February lawsuit filed by European banker Arnaud Lannic, one of the Fyzz Facility investors.\nLannic\u2019s investment firm, Shiny River, provided more than $7 million in loans from 2015 through mid-2016 in part to finance seven movies, but half of those projects were never made. (With interest, Lannic\u2019s attorney said, the debt at issue in the pending lawsuit now exceeds $14 million.)\nRather than investing in their business, Emmett and Furla paid themselves rich producer fees to \u201cmeet their extravagant living expenses,\u201d Shiny River alleged in the suit. Lannic, through his attorney, declined to comment.\nThe Shiny River suit also said that during a 2018 meeting at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York, Furla led Fyzz investors to believe that EFO was good for the money and its film library was worth around $9.6 million.\nBut, since then, an appraiser hired by Lannic \u201cconcluded that the EFO film library is worth, at best, only $2.1 million.\u201d\nEmmett and Furla declined to comment on Lannic\u2019s lawsuit.\nTwo years ago, Emmett and Furla began hunting for new partners and engaged in preliminary sales talks with Lionsgate, their longtime distribution partner. But the deal, referred to internally as \u201cProject X,\u201d never materialized.\nSoon, the pair thought they\u2019d found a new financial savior \u2014 New York investment firm Forest Road. An internal 2020 deal memo, reviewed by The Times, showed the firm considered paying $12 million for preferred EFO shares. But Forest Road, which declined to comment, withdrew.\nBy mid-2021, EFO was teetering. Filmmaking costs had soared due to the pandemic.\nThe producers moved out of their Wilshire Boulevard offices, leaving a debt of $336,000 in unpaid rent, parking and phone fees, according to an October lawsuit. (The landlord\u2019s attorney declined to comment.) \u201cWe fail to see how Randall\u2019s dispute differs from the numerous lease disputes resulting from Covid,\u201d Hofmeister said.\nMeanwhile, a Beverly Hills entrepreneur, filmmaker and investor, Jonathan Baker, was still steamed that Emmett allegedly reneged on a 2015 agreement for a two-picture deal. They made one film \u201cInconceivable,\u201d starring Nicolas Cage, which Baker directed, but their dealings soured. Baker sued in 2017 to try to get his $1-million investment back and reluctantly agreed to a $640,000 settlement.\nBut Emmett and Furla paid only a fraction of that amount, and in December 2020 L.A. County Superior Court Judge Craig D. Karlan ordered them to pay $570,855, according to a judgment. A person close to Emmett and Furla disputed Baker\u2019s allegations and said negotiations have been complicated by Baker\u2019s desire to include production of a second film in any resolution. Baker said they wanted him to first invest an additional $1 million.\n\u201cRandy and George prey on people with empty promises and they have only one thing in mind: Extract millions upon millions of dollars only to be told you will never work in this town again if you stand up to them,\u201d Baker said.\nIn March 2021, Baker\u2019s attorney, Joseph Kar, won a court order to freeze the EFO bank accounts. But just before the freeze went into effect, Furla withdrew $125,090 from the company\u2019s accounts, according to court testimony.\n\u201cThat\u2019s problematic to say the least,\u201d Karlan said at a hearing this year. Furla had told Kar during a court-ordered examination that he had been unaware the freeze was imminent. \u201cWhen money comes in, why should it just sit there?\u201d Furla asked. (He declined to comment.)\nWhen finances were tight, Szymanska said she often heard Emmett and Furla discussing making \u201canother bull\u2014 Bruce Willis movie.\u201d Emmett denies that he made such remarks, Hofmeister said.\nOne of the last films the company made with the actor was \u201cWrong Place,\u201d for which Willis spent two days on set in Alabama. His two associates \u2014 his producing partner, Stephen J. Eads, and Adam Huel Potter, who fed lines to Willis through an earpiece \u2014 guided him.\n\u201cHe was never alone,\u201d said Szymanska, who spent time on location. \u201cWhen nobody from Bruce\u2019s team was around, the crew would say how sad we were to see him in this state.\u201d\nFive months later, the actor\u2019s family would disclose his aphasia diagnosis.\nEads and Potter did not respond to questions from The Times about their work with Willis. The actor\u2019s attorney, Singer, said that his client relying on Eads and others was similar to \u201cStevie Wonder having an assistant lead him on stage to perform, or Marlee Matlin\u2019s reliance on a sign language interpreter[.] My client allegedly relying on Stephen Eads or others to provide certain assistance is in the same vein. ... It ought to be commended.\u201d\nEmmett was barely on the \u201cWrong Place\u201d set, according to crew members. After a brief appearance, he traveled from Birmingham, Ala., to Nashville, where onlookers would snap those now-infamous pictures of him out on the town with women who were not his fiancee. On Oct. 27, 12 days after the images surfaced, Kent moved out of the house on Mulholland Drive, her 7-month-old daughter in her arms.\nAs his custody battle began, Emmett continued to fight Baker\u2019s claims in court. In a hearing in late May, A. Raymond Hamrick III, a longtime lawyer for Furla and Emmett, rejected allegations that the pair had created a web of limited liability shell companies to shield themselves and their film titles from creditors.\n\u201cThis was not a shell. This was an active company [but] COVID gutted them,\u201d Hamrick told the judge. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t produce for two years because of COVID.\u201d\nBut the pair filmed at least eight movies during the pandemic, including \u201cWrong Place.\u201d\nBaker\u2019s attorney, Kar, has continued to press his case that Emmett and Furla should be held personally liable for their debt.\n\u201cThe company doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d Emmett told Kar in a late April deposition. \u201cThere\u2019s no employees, there\u2019s no money for overhead, there\u2019s no money \u2014 you know, we got hit really bad in COVID and had substantial overages on movies and liabilities the company has taken on and just couldn\u2019t survive anymore.\u201d\nEmmett said he had \u201cresigned\u201d from EFO to start a new venture: a new company called Convergence Entertainment. Emmett put his Mulholland Drive home on the market in May for $6.3 million. He also moved back into his old Wilshire Boulevard office building \u2014 despite the litigation over unpaid rent.\n\u201cI just wanted office space \u2026 to be able to get jobs as a director,\u201d Emmett told Kar. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on now.\u201d\nOn Friday Emmett wrapped production on the Georgia set of a new bank heist movie called \u201cCash Out.\u201d\nIt stars John Travolta.\nTimes staff researchers Scott Wilson and Cary Schneider contributed to this report.

      "text": "Settled in a quiet part of the San Fernando Valley, right off Oxnard Street, there\u2019s an unassuming car garage that sits on the edge of a small parking lot. While the building\u2019s weathered gray exterior draws little attention, the inside of the facility evokes the feeling of a Hollywood movie set.\nAgainst a backdrop of red brick tiles and LED-lit signs, the interior showcases some of the most luxurious and exotic supercars around\u2014from brightly-colored Lamborghinis and Ferraris to high-end SUVs, Rolls Royces and Mercedes Benz G-Wagons.\nThis hideout is home to Drive LA, an exotic car-sharing platform that allows well-to-do customers\u2014typically athletes, entertainers and executives\u2014to rent from a collection of luxury automobiles. Drive LA also allows customers to rent on a long-term basis with flexible terms or offer their own inactive sports cars to join the fleet and potentially yield a profit as someone else drives it.\nMost customers don\u2019t know that at times the Drive LA showroom contains some notable athletes\u2019 cars, too, from Chicago Bears\u2019 tight end Marcedes Lewis to Arizona Diamondbacks\u2019 outfielder Tommy Pham. These athletes are also investors in the marketing and fleet-management company.\nFor decades, athletes with money to burn and underdeveloped investment prowess have been lured by the temptation of buying luxury cars, and have squandered their earnings. However, a handful of athletes are changing the victim narrative by letting these cars drive meaningful dividends while also investing in the future of car sharing.\nToronto Raptors forward and Drive LA investor Thaddeus Young says he wouldn\u2019t spend loads of cash on a flashy ride. He was drawn to Drive LA by the monetary benefit of allowing outside customers to make payments and finance nice cars while retaining the ability to drive one of them when he leaves Canada for a brief stay in warm LA.\n\u201cIf I want go buy a [fancy] car, now I can turn that car into an asset that makes me money over the course of time,\u201d said Young, who is also the founder of Reform Ventures, a private investment fund. \u201cAnd when I want to drive it, I can just have it shipped back to me for the two, three months that I\u2019m home [in Texas] when I\u2019m not in season.\u201d\nThe emerging experience company, which has leased more than 75 cars in its fleet to customers, has some high-profile backers, who see great value in letting others drive their supercars when they\u2019re not around.\nWithout the liabilities that come with owning your own fleet of cars, the company acts more like an asset protection program that facilitates connections between dealerships and their customers, who have the chance to rent these luxury cars while building their own credit.\nDrive LA CEO Ben Halem believes car sharing is the future as drivers look for more reliable and convenient options. Some studies show more consumers in urban areas are viewing car ownership as an unnecessary expense and have grown curious about alternatives that free them from responsibility and upkeep of a gas-guzzling, devaluing asset.\nCreating another option for wealthier individuals\u2014utilizing otherwise idle cars\u2014is perhaps the next step toward closing the mobility satisfaction gap. And companies like Drive LA look to provide customers the chance let their high-performance cars make a profit, and even potentially pay for themselves.\n\u201cA Honda Civic could cost you more than a Ferrari out of your pocket,\u201d Halem said in an interview.\nBacked by changes in consumer attitudes and spending habits, the car-sharing market is projected to exceed $11 billion by next year, according to Global Market Insights Inc. Additionally, the global car-sharing market is expected to grow to $6 billion by 2030, according to a recent report from VynZ Research.\nAntimatter Business Partners founder Rashaun Williams, a key investor in Drive LA, has put together athlete investors who have venture capital interest in the company. Young and a handful of other athletes, who have varying stakes, are seeing monthly distributions from their investments while also keeping the option of a high-end car delivered at their convenience.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like doing a real estate deal in short term,\u201d Young said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to collect good returns. The only difference is that this is a depreciating asset, but you\u2019re still getting money on the back end.\u201d\nDrive LA intentionally keeps a low profile, spreading through word-of-mouth and social media. The two-year-old company shows off its fleet via influencers\u2014Cindy Prado and Daniel Mac have both posted with cars from Drive LA\u2014and by dropping off top-notch cars at upscale hotels or airport tarmacs.\nDrive LA\u2014LA stands for luxury autos, despite its Los Angeles origins\u2014will soon open a second garage in Scottsdale, Ariz. The emerging company, which hopes to partner with car manufacturers and create various data-collecting programs, plans to launch locations further east, including in New York City, which has the nation\u2019s largest concentration of millionaires.\nIn the meantime, the place continues to serve as an example of what intentional investment can bring for pro athletes and celebrities, who are notorious for overspending on frivolous assets. Drive LA\u2019s athlete investors are bucking the trend by profiting from the sharing models.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been taught to be users of a product,\u201d Young said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a stage now where we\u2019re thinking completely different as athletes. Now we\u2019re able to be owners of the products and brands we\u2019re using on the day-to-day basis.\u201d"
