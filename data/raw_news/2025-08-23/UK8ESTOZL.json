I\u2019m a public servant,\u201d said Tisch, 44, who received a rousing welcome from the roughly 100 people at the Southampton hotspot 75 Main, per an attendee who called her reception \u201ctremendous.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople think she\u2019s doing a terrific job as police commissioner,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe commissioner, who was introduced at the breakfast by First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro, spoke for nearly 30 minutes minutes and touched on of Gotham-centric topics.\n\nShe said she opposed President Trump bringing in the National Guard or troops to patrol New York City.\n\n\u201cViolent crime is at record lows,\u201d Tisch said as she cited Gotham\u2019s low murder rate this year, among other stats,\n\n\u201cThe NYPD is the best police department, the best trained,\u201d she added.\n\nShe called the anti-Israel protests in the city \u201cvile and disgusting\u201d but added that the NYPD has to respect \u201cfreedom of speech.\u201d\n\nAnd she said she loves her job as police commissioner as she did her prior stint as sanitation commissioner to devise ways to make the city cleaner.\n\nThe roughly 100 attendees were either backers of former Governor Andrew Cuomo or Mayor Eric Adams, but mostly had frontrunner Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani on their mind.\n\n\u201cPeople are grappling with how to deal with Mamdani,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe breakfast series is co-hosted by WABC radio owner and grocery mogul John Catsimatidis",

      "text": "Mom who killed family in murder-suicide boasted about being \u2018obsessed\u2019 with husband and \u2018flying off the cuff\u2019\nThe New Hampshire mom who killed her husband and two kids in a shocking murder-suicide had said she couldn\u2019t imagine life without her cancer-stricken spouse \u2014 as she confessed to being prone to \u201cfly off the cuff,\u201d while denying it was ever in \u201ca violent way.\u201d\nEmily Long, 34, made the ominous remarks in a lengthy TikTok video shared on her private account as she discussed being \u201cobsessed\u201d with her 48-year-old hubby, Ryan Long, and bracing for the possibility that he would die from his aggressive form of brain cancer.\nIn the clip \u2014 titled \u201cwatch me brag about my husband for 7 minutes\u201d \u2014 Emily gushed that the father of her kids was \u201cliterally the best human on this planet\u201d and a \u201cphenomenally perfect man.\u201d\nAt one point, she rattled off the differences between the pair \u2014 acknowledging she was the more \u201cemotionally driven\u201d one in their relationship while Ryan was \u201clike my perfect opposite.\u201d\n\u201cI am very outspoken, very impulsive, emotionally driven \u2026 I don\u2019t take boundaries very well. And, like, I fly off the cuff in not like a violent way, obviously,\u201d she laughed, adding that \u201cIf I feel something, I am going to say it. Sometimes it gets me into trouble.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s always devil\u2019s advocate as much as it literally kills me. He\u2019s so thoughtful in his decisions. He\u2019s the most ethical human on this entire planet. Every single decision he makes is based on his code of ethics,\u201d she added in the over-the-top tribute.\nAs she continued to heap praise on her partner, the mom reflected on the life lessons he had taught her, including how to ask for help and the importance of being vulnerable.\n\u201cI think one of the things I\u2019m going to miss is being able to show him how wonderful he\u2019s been to me and he can enjoy that. I think that bums me out,\u201d she said in the video.\nEmily said she was heartbroken at the thought she\u2019d no longer be able to trade bizarre stories and have him roast her.\n\u201cThere is no point to this video except to say like, yes, I feel sorry for myself and I\u2019m scared about how my life is going to change and how hard it is going to be for me,\u201d she said in the clip.\n\u201cBut I know how truly at the end of the day I am just so scared that all these wonderful things from this phenomenally perfect man, who has given me more than I can ever thank him for, might not be here to see all that.\u201d\nThe video was among a slew of TikToks she posted in the months leading up to Monday\u2019s shocking murder-suicide that shed light on her declining mental state \u2014 including one where she even admitted she needed professional help.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear exactly when Long posted the seven-minute clip, which has since been reposted by other users.\nThe harrowing details continued to emerge just days after investigators said she shot her husband and her two eldest children \u2014 Parker, 8, and Ryan, 6 \u2014 before taking her own life at their Madbury, New Hampshire, home early Monday.\nThe couple\u2019s 3-year-old child \u2014 the lone survivor of the slaughter \u2014 was found alive and unharmed inside the house.\nThe mom\u2019s death was ruled a suicide while her family members\u2019 deaths were ruled homicides, according to the New Hampshire Attorney General\u2019s Office.\nInvestigators haven\u2019t yet revealed a motive for the tragedy.\n\u201cWhile investigators are becoming aware of various concerns/issues ongoing in the household at the time of the event in question, people should avoid speculating that this event was caused by a single reason or stressor,\u201d the AG\u2019s office said in a statement."

Last year, her dealer, Jaquan Casserly, was sentenced to 10 years after he pleaded guilty to felony drug sale.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra was found unconscious aboard a boat named Ripple at the ritzy yacht club around midnight. The vessel is one of at least two Grateful Dead-themed 54-foot Sea Ray craft owned by insurance mogul Christopher Durnan, sources previously told The Post.\nHomicide detectives are waiting on additional toxicology test results before releasing an official cause of death for Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra. A final report is expected back \u201cby . . . early next month, at the latest,\u201d said one source.\nArthur Aidala, the lawyer for Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s family, did not return a call for comment."

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be deported after refusing plea offer\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, according to a Saturday court filing.\nThe Costa Rica offer came late Thursday, after it was clear that the Salvadoran national would likely be released from a Tennessee jail the following day. Abrego Garcia declined to extend his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his family. Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.\nHis attorneys declined to comment on whether the plea offer had been formally rescinded. The brief they filed only said that Abrego Garcia had declined one part of the offer \u2014 to remain in jail \u2014 and that his attorneys would \u201ccommunicate the government\u2019s proposal to Mr. Abrego.\u201d\nFiled along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn\u2019t face the possibility of detention. An additional benefit of the offer would be that Costa Rica is a Spanish-speaking country, like Abrego Garcia\u2019s native El Salvador. Abrego Garcia would only be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence on the smuggling charges, according to the brief.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s case became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.\n\u201cThe government immediately responded to Mr. Abrego\u2019s release with outrage,\u201d the filing reads. \u201cDespite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego\u2019s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE\u2019s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning,\u201d it says, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nStay up to date on alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia\n- Trump admin plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia after prison release \u2013 and not to El Salvador, prosecutor tells judge\n- Kilmar Abrego Garcia back in US to face charges of trafficking thousands of illegal migrants \u2014 including MS-13 gangbangers\n- Moment alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia was accused of human trafficking revealed in new bodycam video\n- Alleged MS-13 gangbanger\u2019s rank, street name revealed as fight over deportation to El Salvador megaprison rages: docs\n- Supreme Court rules Trump admin must \u2018facilitate\u2019 return of wrongfully deported Maryland man\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges, which stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\nA Department of Homeland Security agent testified that he didn\u2019t begin investigating the traffic stop until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.\nAlthough Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours\u2019 notice before initiating deportation proceedings \u2014 time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.\n\u201cPlease let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),\u201d it states.\nFederal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador where he faces a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of violence, according to court filings."

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.
