  "description": "XTRA:PFV 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology's Fair Values from the Community and...",
  "content": "Explore Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nSoft earnings didn't appear to concern Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology AG's (ETR:PFV) shareholders over the last week. We think that the softer headline numbers might be getting counterbalanced by some positive underlying factors.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nThe Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit\n\nFor anyone who wants to understand Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology's profit beyond the statutory numbers, it's important to note that during the last twelve months statutory profit was reduced by \u20ac17m due to unusual items. It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. If Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nNote: we always recommend investors check balance sheet strength. Click here to be taken to our balance sheet analysis of Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology.\n\nOur Take On Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology's Profit Performance\n\nBecause unusual items detracted from Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology's earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! On the other hand, its EPS actually shrunk in the last twelve months. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. If you want to do dive deeper into Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology (1 is concerning) you should be familiar with.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\n\nHave feedback on this article?
