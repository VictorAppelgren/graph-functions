  "description": "President Trump adopts two-pronged China strategy using tariffs to rebuild manufacturing while negotiating from strength to counter economic coercion tactics",
  "content": "When President Donald Trump returned to the White House in 2025, he faced the same formidable adversary that defined much of his first term: China. This time the stakes were even higher. The trade deficit with China had ballooned to roughly $300 billion, while IP protection, currency manipulation and predatory industrial and international development practices remained significant issues. And Beijing doubled down \u2014 weaponizing its control of rare earth minerals, tightening its grip on semiconductors and wielding economic coercion against U.S. allies from Australia to Lithuania.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Trump 47 adopted a two-pronged approach. On offense, the administration has kept maximum pressure on Beijing, staying firm on negotiation positions and refusing to trade away leverage until real concessions emerge. On defense, it has wielded tariffs not only as bargaining chips but as engines of industrial revival \u2014 reshoring supply chains, rebuilding America\u2019s manufacturing base and hardening strategic alliances to reduce dependence on China.\n\nThese were not easy calls. Tariffs rattled markets. Pressure campaigns risked alienating partners. Yet the strategy has been to hold the line, play a long game and push forward until the U.S. secured fairer, reciprocal trade terms. In a world where semiconductors and rare earths are the new oil, this is about nothing less than U.S. national security.\n\nTRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA\n\nI have seen firsthand how high-stakes these negotiations can be. As I recount in my forthcoming book, \"A Seat at the Table,\" Chinese officials have long relied on psychological tactics, slow-walking responses through layers of bureaucracy, handing us last-minute drafts in Chinese \u2014 even removing chairs at negotiating tables. These are not trivial gestures. They are meant to unnerve, unsettle and push the U.S. team toward compromise.\n\nThe Trump response was simple but powerful: don\u2019t flinch. In Beijing, when presented with a Chinese draft that ignored our work, Secretary Steven Mnuchin waved it away and insisted the talks proceed on the American document. When a chair was removed to show disrespect, we calmly got it back\u2014without ever conceding authority.\n\nThat posture of confidence \u2014 staying the course under pressure \u2014 continues today in Trump 47. Tariffs are sharper, more targeted and higher than before; allied trade deals (Japan, South Korea, the EU) allow us to focus resources on China; and deadlines are extended when useful, but only on U.S. terms.\n\nCritics say tariffs raise consumer prices. In the short term, they can. But the broader truth is that tariffs are tools to rewire incentives, drive investment back home, and ensure the United States does not remain vulnerable in sectors critical to survival. Already, the tariffs of Trump 47 are accelerating investment in domestic chip foundries, battery plants and energy infrastructure. They are also forcing hard conversations with allies about aligning supply chains \u2014 from rare earth processing in Australia to semiconductor alliances with Japan and the Netherlands.\n\nWhen Beijing weaponized exports of gallium and graphite, vital for defense and electronics, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act and doubled down on Indo-Pacific partnerships. The message is clear: America will not be held hostage to coercion. Strategic autonomy requires resilience, even if it comes with short-term discomfort.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nHow do you stay steady when the stakes are so high, when the pressure is relentless? Stand aside Hans Morgenthau. For me, the source I found was the timeless wisdom of \"Kedushas Levi,\" an 18th-century Chassidic work by Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev.\n\nThe \"Kedushas Levi\" teaches that challenges \u2014 no matter how overwhelming \u2014 are never insurmountable. \"If you encounter an obstacle that is bigger than you, do not be fearful or frightened. With simple faith, what you fear will not harm you,\" it states. That teaching, echoing the Talmudic reality that the good Lord gives trials in proportion to a person\u2019s strength, gave me composure when sprinting to translate a Chinese draft in a Beijing motorcade, or when facing off with officials determined to stall and delay.\n\nTRUMP BLASTED FOR \u2018STEEP CONCESSIONS TO BEIJING\u2019 AFTER CHIP DEAL, CANCELED TAIWANESE VISIT\n\nIt also teaches that truth, even when inconvenient, carries divine weight. When Chinese officials resisted opening their financial markets, I pointed out the obvious but often ignored truth: Chinese banks in the U.S. had seen double- and triple-digit growth, while U.S. banks in China struggled for even single digits. That argument broke through where posturing could not.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNegotiations with China will not be wrapped up overnight. But this is a contest of wills as much as economics. And here, the lessons of faith matter most. Facing giants, the Jewish tradition teaches, you do not shrink back. You lift your head high, stand on truth, and trust that what feels impossible can indeed be achieved.\n\nThat is how we approached China in Trump 45. That is how we are approaching China in Trump 47. And that is how America, with faith and fortitude, can win.",

      "text": "In July, some of the brightest minds in American technology descended on Washington to celebrate a major milestone: the launch of President Donald Trump's bold initiative to ensure the United States remains the world's unrivaled leader in artificial intelligence (AI).\nLet me be blunt: the AI arms race is no longer theoretical. It's here. And we cannot afford to come in second place.\nIn business, if you don't constantly adapt and innovate, you lose. Nations are no different. If we fail to lead in AI, we risk surrendering our economic and national security edge to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) \u2014 a regime that seeks to challenge American technological supremacy and reshape the global order in its authoritarian image.\nAMERICA MUST WIN THE AI RACE \u2014 AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST\nTrump understands this. That's why his vision for American renewal is laser-focused on innovation, particularly in AI and emerging technologies that will shape our economy and define the nature of future conflict.\nWe have to stop being complacent with a slow, outdated and reactive government. The future demands urgency, ambition and a commitment to putting America first at every turn. This is about building a trusted AI ecosystem that is private-sector led, American-built, and decisive in its capacity to defend freedom.\nThere's a quote from Christian Brose's book, \"The Kill Chain,\" that has stayed with me: \"Over the past decade, in U.S. war games against China, the United States has a nearly perfect record: We have lost almost every single time.\"\nDETAILS OF TRUMP'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED AI PLAN REVEALED BY WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF MAJOR SPEECH\nThat's a wake-up call for every American.\nThe CCP is not just trying to compete. They're trying to dominate. From economic espionage and cyber infiltration to exploiting our supply chains and siphoning off our data, the CCP is engaged in full-spectrum technological warfare. The next conflict will not look like the last. It will be a battle of data, autonomy, and algorithmic superiority \u2014 and the side that controls the best AI will win. \\\nThis isn't just a defense imperative; it's an economic one. The AI infrastructure boom will generate thousands of high-paying jobs across the country. From building advanced data centers to manufacturing chips, American workers are at the center of this effort. And making sure every family in this country has the opportunity to get a good job is how we win. That's why Trump's action plan doesn't just emphasize innovation; it prioritizes workforce development, energy modernization and secure supply chains.\nWyoming's vast energy resources will be absolutely critical to winning this race. AI data centers require massive amounts of reliable, baseload power \u2014 the kind that Wyoming's abundant coal and natural gas can deliver, 24/7, 365 days a year. While other states struggle with expensive, intermittent energy sources, Wyoming offers both the dependable power and affordable rates that give American companies a decisive advantage. Our state stands ready to power America's AI revolution with the energy infrastructure that will keep our systems running affordably when national and economic security is on the line.\nAI ARMS RACE: US AND CHINA WEAPONIZE DRONES, CODE AND BIOTECH FOR THE NEXT GREAT WAR\nAmerican manufacturing is at the heart of this effort, and that includes making sure our critical data stays right here at home.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nLet's ask a simple question: do you want your personal data stored on American soil, protected by American workers and American laws \u2014 or housed in China, where it's subject to Communist surveillance and exploitation?\nThis isn't a hypothetical. It's already happening. And that's exactly why American companies are investing billions to build state-of-the-art facilities here at home. These aren't just buildings filled with servers. Data centers are the digital backbone of everything from telehealth and e-commerce to our intelligence agencies and defense systems. They are a critical piece of the AI puzzle and a national security asset we can't afford to outsource. But they're also massive energy consumers \u2014 which makes Wyoming's affordable, dependable energy production essential to keeping these facilities running 24/7.\nTrump's plan rightly focuses on removing barriers and burdensome regulations to allow for the rapid buildout of data centers. His America First AI agenda is the roadmap. But it's up to all of us, from the private sector to Congress, to take the action necessary to propel us forward. We cannot afford to be na\u00efve about the economic and national security risks of falling behind.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWe must ensure that the future of AI is developed in the U.S.A., powered by American energy, and guided by our enduring values of freedom, innovation and hard work.\nThe AI arms race is on \u2014 and America doesn't lose races. Let's win this one, together."

Hundreds of billions of dollars a year we lose to China, and unless we solve that problem, I\u2019m not going to make a deal,\" he said. \"I\u2019m willing to make a deal with China, but they have to solve this surplus.

But China would be the worst in the group because the deficit is so big, and it\u2019s not sustainable.\n\"I was elected on this,\" Trump added.\nTrump spoke to reporters for about 16 minutes, and during that time reporters asked him numerous questions about the tariffs.\nThe president anticipates that by next year, the tariffs will bring in an additional $1 trillion. He also said companies will begin relocating to the U.S. in places like North Carolina, Detroit and Illinois.\n\"What's going to happen to the market? I can't tell you. But I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger, and eventually it'll be a country like no other,\" Trump said. \"It'll be the most dominant country, economically, in the world, which is what it should be.\"\nTrump also turned to Truth Social on Sunday night to weigh in on the tariffs.\n\"We have massive Financial Deficits with China, the European Union, and many others. The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing Tens of Billions of Dollars into the U.S.A.,\" the president wrote. \"They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold. The Surplus with these Countries has grown during the 'Presidency' of Sleepy Joe Biden. We are going to reverse it, and reverse it QUICKLY. Some day people will realize that Tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!\"\nTrump implemented a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods into the United States while some countries were slapped with higher tariffs.\nHe took an especially tough approach to China, which was already hit with a 20% tariff earlier this year. China will now face a 34% reciprocal tariff in addition to the 10% baseline imposed on all listed nations.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCanada and Mexico are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs for now, but they face a 25% tariff on goods, with Canada also being slapped with a 10% energy tariff. While Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney vowed to \"fight these tariffs with countermeasures,\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country would announce a \"comprehensive program\" on Thursday, according to Reuters.\nFox News Digital's Rachel Wolf contributed to this report."

      "text": "President Donald Trump blasted China recently on Truth Social, saying Beijing had \"TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.\" Trump furiously concluded, \"So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"\nApparently, in return for mutual deescalation of trade tensions, Beijing had committed to again allow the free flow of rare earth minerals to the U.S. However, they did not follow through on that promise. No wonder Trump was angry; he should not, however, have been surprised.\nThe White House will try to resolve this issue, and will hopefully again reduce mutual tariffs. The stock market will celebrate a near-term resolution, business managers will exhale, and shoppers won\u2019t hoard Barbies for Christmas.\nTRUMP WARNS COURT RULING AGAINST TARIFFS COULD LEAD TO 'ECONOMIC RUINATION' OF US\nBut longer term, the Trump White House must commit to eliminating our dependence on China for essential goods, which gives Beijing a stranglehold on our economy. China is an enemy and cannot be trusted. Relying on them for rare earths or for other critical goods, like pharmaceuticals, is dangerous.\nRare earths are \"essential\"; we need lanthanum and cerium, for instance, to make camera lenses and catalytic converters, respectively. Indeed, we need rare earths to produce everything from cars to missiles to cell phones. China accounts for about 60% of global mine output as well as 90% of processed materials. Our economy comes to a virtual standstill without these products. The Chinese know this and will take advantage of that reliance.\nThis is one reason that Trump\u2019s proposal of a joint venture with Ukraine is brilliant. If the two countries can together begin to mine and process rare minerals, the U.S. will have a vested interest in defending Ukraine against Russian aggression (while our presence might presumably deter another assault) and the undertaking would also help alleviate our reliance on China. Ukraine is home to 22 of the 34 minerals classified as \"critical\" by the EU; we need them.\nPUTIN SAYS RUSSIA IS OPEN TO ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH US ON RARE EARTH MINERALS\nIt is not just rare earths and minerals we should be concerned about. Since the COVID-19 emergency, Americans have become increasingly aware that we also depend on China (and to a lesser degree India) for many essential pharmaceuticals, a reliance which could prove deadly should Beijing choose to block exports.\nIn last year\u2019s first quarter, a total of 323 drugs were in short supply, according to data published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the highest level since reporting began in 2001. The shortages sent parents searching high and low for amoxicillin and other prescription drugs for themselves and their kids.\nThe Covid pandemic revealed the downside of not being self-sufficient in medical goods, when Beijing chose to withhold vital drugs and personal protective equipment from Americans. One of the most outrageous derelictions of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency was not addressing that dangerous vulnerability.\nAt the outset of the pandemic, China controlled roughly half the global production of products like face masks and ventilators; though they expanded output 12-fold as Covid spread, they stopped exports to the U.S. The United States, for its part, was importing about 90% of the surgical face masks we used, even though we had invented virus-filtering N95 masks and disposable nitrile gloves.\nBetween January and March 2020, Chinese exports of critical medical goods to the U.S. fell sharply. China apologists argue (wrongly) that the decline stemmed from tariffs placed on such goods during the first Trump administration. Ventilators, oxygen masks and other medical products were not covered by Trump\u2019s tariffs against China; the fall-off was a purposeful decision by Beijing to restrict U.S. supplies.\nReacting to critical shortages, with health workers having to reuse masks and wear garbage bags over their heads for protection, U.S. firms stepped up and began producing the necessary protective gear. But, as the emergency waned, China resorted to its usual practices and flooded our market with cheap products, undercutting U.S. manufacturers.\nThat\u2019s when the Biden administration should have stepped in to protect U.S. producers; for an administration that exhibited an almost religious zeal for wearing masks, ensuring domestic output (and availability) would seem a layup. They did not.\nIn April 2025, the New York Times reported, \"Few domestic industries have been as devastated by the flood of cheap Chinese imports as manufacturers of face masks, exam gloves and other disposable medical gear that protects healthcare workers from infectious pathogens.\" At the height of the pandemic, some 107 U.S. companies had started up to produce masks and glove; today only five remain.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIt was not just PPE that became scarce. In 2020, the New York Times quoted a Chinese health specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations saying, \"Chinese pharmaceutical companies have supplied more than 90 percent of U.S. antibiotics, vitamin C, ibuprofen and hydrocortisone, as well as 70 percent of acetaminophen and 40 to 45 percent of heparin in recent years.\"\nONE STATE\u2019S NATURAL RESOURCES CAN FINALLY PUT AN END TO AMERICA\u2019S RELIANCE ON CHINA\nCongress, alarmed by revelations of U.S. dependence for PPE and pharmaceuticals, did what they do best: ordered up some studies on the issue and demanded better reporting. During Trump\u2019s last year in office, his administration tried to boost domestic manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, but the effort died in the Biden years.\nIn last year\u2019s first quarter, a total of 323 drugs were in short supply, according to data published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the highest level since reporting began in 2001.\nThis is a fixable problem. If we can devote hundreds of billions of dollars to boosting domestic production of windmills and semiconductors, surely we should be taking similar steps to end our dependence on Chinese-provided drugs.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe New York Times revealed the Biden administration\u2019s multi-billion-dollar solution to drug shortages writing, \"The White House earlier this month proposed\u2026 linking Medicare payments to hospitals in part on whether hospitals do a good job buying drugs from companies that demonstrate quality over the long term, rather than just the cheapest price.\"\nThat is not a solution. Instead, a solution would entail reducing our dependence on China for essential goods of all kinds and making domestic manufacturing profitable again through lower taxes, new technology like AI and deregulation. These are policies that dominate the Trump agenda, and they will work to make the U.S. independent again."

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

      "text": "For more than two decades, Washington and New Delhi built a strategic partnership that was hailed as one of the great success stories of post\u2013Cold War diplomacy. Today, that relationship is facing its most serious test in years \u2014 and India is signaling it has other options.\n\"We\u2019re in a situation in the U.S.-India relationship where the premises and assumptions of the last 25 years \u2014 that everybody worked very hard to build, including the president in his first term \u2014 have just come completely unraveled,\" said Evan Feigenbaum, a South Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The trust is gone.\"\nSince President Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on Indian imports, New Delhi has turned visibly eastward. India\u2019s national security adviser traveled to Moscow in recent weeks, its foreign minister is visiting this week and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi just concluded talks in Delhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is preparing for his first trip to China in more than seven years, while Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to host him in Moscow before the end of the year.\nThe pivot underscores how tariffs meant to punish India for its continued purchases of Russian oil may instead be pushing New Delhi closer to America\u2019s rivals.\nTRUMP AND PUTIN\u2019S RELATIONSHIP TURNS SOUR AS PRESIDENT PUSHES FOR RESOLUTION WITH UKRAINE\nTariffs and backlash\nTrump slapped a 25% tariff on Indian imports earlier this year, citing India\u2019s willingness to keep buying Russian crude. On August 27, that tariff is set to double to 50%.\nIndian public opinion has bristled at what many see as U.S. interference in sovereign decision-making. \"They\u2019re signaling very clearly that they view that as interference in India\u2019s foreign policy, and they are not going to put up with it,\" Feigenbaum said.\nDespite initial hesitation, state-run refiners resumed Russian oil purchases, lured by discounts of 6% to 7%. Russian oil now accounts for 35% of India\u2019s imports, up from a negligible 0.2% before the Ukraine war. Moscow, for its part, has seized the opening. \"We continue to ship fuel, including crude oil and oil products, thermal and coking coal,\" said Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov. \"We see potential for the export of Russian LNG.\"\nTRUMP\u2019S DEADLINE ON SECONDARY TARIFFS ARRIVES; US-RUSSIAN RELATIONS HANG IN THE BALANCE\nMoscow and Beijing step in\nRussia is using the rift to promote its vision of a \"great Eurasian partnership\" linking Moscow, Beijing and Delhi.\n\"All of this engagement we\u2019re seeing between India and China now is not exclusively coming because of Trump and his tariffs,\" said Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst. \"We\u2019ve actually seen indications for almost a year of India wanting to ease tensions with China and strengthen relations, mainly for economic reasons. But the Trump administration\u2019s policies have made India want to move even more quickly.\"\nSome of India\u2019s moves are diplomatic theater meant to signal anger at Washington. But others are more durable. \"India is going to double down on some aspects of its economic and defense relationship with Russia,\" Feigenbaum said. \"And those parts are not performative.\"\nKugelman noted that before the Ukraine war, India had already begun reducing its reliance on Russian arms imports in favor of U.S., French and Israeli systems. \"But as soon as the invasion happened, India very quickly started buying more from Russia, particularly energy,\" he said. \"This is essentially validation of a view in India that the U.S. can\u2019t be trusted, whereas Russia can \u2014 because Russia is always going to be there for India no matter what.\"\nDomestic politics and defiance\nModi has used the standoff to reinforce his image at home as a defender of sovereignty. \"India actually made a fair number of concessions to the Trump administration early on in its second term,\" Kugelman said, citing tariff reductions and agreements to repatriate undocumented workers. \"Because of those concessions, India needs to be careful about signaling further willingness to bend. This is one reason there was no trade deal \u2014 Modi put his foot down.\"\nWhile not directly criticizing Trump, Modi has emphasized that his priority is protecting the livelihoods of farmers, small businesses and young workers. That defiant tone, Kugelman added, has \"real political mileage\" in India\u2019s domestic debate.\nWashington\u2019s frustration\nThe Trump administration has shown no signs of backing down. Former White House trade advisor Peter Navarro blasted India\u2019s oil purchases as \"opportunistic\" and \"deeply corrosive\" in a Financial Times op-ed this week.\n\"This two-pronged policy will hit India where it hurts \u2014 its access to U.S. markets \u2014 even as it seeks to cut off the financial lifeline it has extended to Russia\u2019s war effort,\" Navarro wrote. \"If India wants to be treated as a strategic partner of the U.S., it needs to start acting like one.\"\nINDIAN PRIME MINISTER MODI TAKES PAGE FROM TRUMP, SAYS 'MAKE INDIA GREAT AGAIN,' OR 'MIGA'\nFrom nuclear deal to strategic drift\nThe contrast with the U.S.\u2013India relationship of two decades ago could not be starker. In 2008, the two countries struck a landmark civil nuclear deal that gave India access to American technology and fuel despite not being a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\"India put the entire government on the line for the deal,\" Feigenbaum recalled. \"Bush really went to the mat and provided a lot of assurances to Congress that were politically not easy, but he was willing to take risks for the relationship.\"\nAt that time, Washington and Delhi managed to work around their disagreements. \"The U.S. objected to many aspects of India\u2019s relationships with Iran, Burma and Russia,\" Feigenbaum said. \"India objected to aspects of the U.S. relationships with China and Pakistan. But neither side let that bleed back into the bilateral relationship in a completely debilitating way.\"\nCan the Quad survive?\nFor years, the U.S. has viewed India as a democratic counterweight to China\u2019s authoritarian model \u2014 central to its Indo-Pacific strategy under Obama, Trump and Biden. But now the question is whether that glue still holds.\n\"Both sides agree that countering China is the main glue that has really bound this relationship together over this 20-year period,\" Kugelman said. \"But the tensions, most of which are on the trade side, have begun to spill over into the broader partnership.\"\nHe noted that India will continue to see China as a long-term competitor because of border disputes and Beijing\u2019s alliance with Pakistan. \"Those realities make it hard to imagine India no longer seeing China as a threat,\" he said. \"So the rationale for the Quad remains. But if the U.S.\u2013India relationship continues this free fall, it will be very difficult to sustain.\"\nTalks on new defense cooperation are still on the calendar. But for now, Kugelman warned, trust has eroded: \"You talk about defense cooperation, intelligence sharing \u2014 that requires a lot of trust. And given what\u2019s happened over the last few months, that might be a harder sell for the Indians.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIndia\u2019s new signaling\nFeigenbaum sees India\u2019s latest maneuvers as a reversal of past dynamics. \"Then, India was leveraging its partnership to signal to then-foe China that it had options,\" he said. \"Now they\u2019re working with the Chinese to signal Washington rather than the other way around.\"\nThe message is clear: India will pursue its interests on its own terms, even if that means drawing closer to America\u2019s rivals."

      "text": "Located in East Asia, China, also known as the People\u2019s Republic of China, is the most populous country in the world, with a population exceeding 1.4 billion. China's largest cities are Shanghai, its financial center, and Beijing, the national capital. The current president is Xi Jinping, who has served in office since 2013. China borders 14 countries, has five time zones, and is made up of 23 provinces. The eastern power is also the world's largest economy by GDP at purchasing power, the second-wealthiest country, and the world's largest manufacturer and exporter. Along with having nuclear capabilities, China is considered a rising superpower and potential global rival to the United States.\nThe modern Chinese government emerged after the fall of its last monarch in 1912, giving way to the emergence of the Republic of China. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, China's ruling nationalists united the Chinese Communist Party to defeat the invading Japanese army. From 1945 to 1949, the country was in a civil war between the nationalists and communists that ended with the CCP claiming victory over modern-day mainland China and the nationalists fleeing to the island of modern-day Taiwan.\nCurrently, China is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party as a one-party socialist Republic. China has economic and political influence over various international organizations, including the United Nations, where it sits on the Security Council as a permanent member with the power to veto measures. China holds membership in the G20, APEC, RBICS, and the East Asia Summit.\nThe Chinese military has the largest standing army by individual military personnel and the second largest defense budget behind the U.S. The government of China has faced criticism for its repression of political dissidents and ethnic and religious minorities. One of China's closest allies is the neighboring eastern power of Russia."

      "text": "The top reason countries go to war is economic and President Donald Trump\u2019s \"reciprocal\" tariff battle is now, more than ever, focused on communist China, just as Beijing suffers a host of serious financial challenges.\nCould this become an example of what Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz said: \"War is the continuation of policy (politics) by other means\"?\nTreasury secretary Scott Bessent said Beijing is a bad actor and the tariff increase for China was \"due to their [China\u2019s] insistence on escalation.\" Of course, most China watchers agree we have an unbalanced trading relationship with Beijing, a situation exacerbated by a decade of worsening relations that turned Beijing into a hostile superpower.\nEscalating trade barriers do not necessarily lead to open conflict. However, history indicates that behind most shooting wars is the need for resources like oil and minerals used in manufacturing. We saw how such interests led to Japan\u2019s 1941 attack on America.\nJapan's decision to industrialize in the late 19th century led to the invasion of Manchuria in 1931 to secure raw materials for its industrial growth. Quickly, Japan established the puppet state of Manchukuo and by 1937, a major war with China erupted.\nJapan\u2019s war with China further starved Tokyo\u2019s war machine, which prompted it to seize other lands across Asia. At that point, the U.S. imposed high tariffs, economic sanctions and embargoes on Japan, which threatened to cripple the Japanese economy.\nBy early 1941, Tokyo and Washington had negotiated for months without success. However, to survive the impact of U.S. economic actions, Japan decided to go to war against America, hoping to destroy our naval fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and thus gain unfettered access to vital raw materials across the Pacific.\nWHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES\nAdmittedly, modern China is not pre-World War II Japan, but it provides an example of a country driven by economic pressures. However, contemporary Beijing faces real economic challenges to its hegemonic ambitions that if not contained could threaten the communists\u2019 grip on that country and its influence across the world.\nPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s options are to accept a souring economy, which could lead to further domestic instability or pull U.S. trading partners to China to replace lost markets. Alternatively, he could resort to military action as both a distraction from domestic woes and a way to change his economic fortunes, such as seizing Taiwan or other regional lands.\nWhat is not in dispute is that China\u2019s economy slowed in 2024, underscoring challenges to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Contributing to that slowing economy is the prolonged property crisis, mounting local government debt and persistent youth unemployment.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nNow, put on top of these challenges Trump\u2019s 145% tariffs, and China could lose at least $525 billion in annual revenues, which translates into millions of unhappy jobless Chinese workers. This outcome will only increase waning business and consumer confidence, weaken the Chinese yuan and accelerate unrest.\nHow will President Xi address the potential loss of the American market? That will be tough because China\u2019s exports are the cornerstone to his economic strategy. Further, his domestic consumer spending is half what it was before the pandemic, and it cannot absorb the excess supply. Then atop this dire circumstance, geopolitical uncertainties are robbing Beijing of foreign investments.\nNo doubt, Trump\u2019s tariffs come at a tough time for China\u2019s communists. President Xi can make bold reforms that stabilize China\u2019s economy, or he may have to create a distraction with his military.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAlternatively, a souring Chinese economy will fuel discontent and could eventually threaten the regime. However, Xi is a survivor, as evidenced by the fact he remained in control during COVID when millions of Chinese lost their jobs.\nYes, there is an outside chance Trump\u2019s brewing trade war with Beijing could lead to real hostilities or Xi\u2019s strategy might be to outlast Trump."

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Friday morning said that an \"80% Tariff on China seems right!\" adding on Truth Social that the final number would be up to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nAn 80% tariff on Chinese goods coming into the U.S. would be nearly half of the current 145% tariff on the Asian country.\nMinutes earlier, he posted: \"CHINA SHOULD OPEN UP ITS MARKET TO USA \u2014 WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR THEM!!! CLOSED MARKETS DON\u2019T WORK ANYMORE!!!\"\nIt was the first time the president has put out a specific number, after previously suggesting the tariff could be lowered.\nPIVOTAL TRADE TRADE WITH BEIJING LOOM AS TRUMP SWEARS IN NEW US AMBASSADOR TO CHINA: \u2018WHAT TIMING\u2019\nTrump\u2019s suggested lower tariffs come ahead of weekend talks between Bessent and chief trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Chinese economic tsar He Lifeng in Switzerland.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a press briefing Friday, \"That was a number the president threw out there, and we'll see what happens this weekend,\" adding that Trump wouldn\u2019t unilaterally lower the tariff and China would be required to make \"concessions.\"\nTRUMP IS COMMITTED TO 10% BASELINE TARIFF, WHITE HOUSE SAYS, DESPITE UK TRADE DEAL ANNOUNCEMENT\nEarlier this week, Trump said that China is eager to make a deal with the U.S.\n\"Scott's going to be going to Switzerland, meeting with China,\" Trump told reporters Thursday at the White House. \"And you know, they very much want to make a deal. We can all play games. Who made the first call, who didn't make them? It doesn't matter. Only matters what happens in that room. But I will tell you that China very much wants to make a deal. We'll see how that works out.\"\nThe Trump administration announced widespread tariffs for multiple countries on April 2, following criticism that other countries' trade practices are unfair towards the U.S.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe administration later adjusted its initial proposal and announced on April 9 it would immediately impose a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, while reducing reciprocal tariffs on other countries for 90 days to a baseline of 10%. China responded by raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%.\nFox News' Diana Stancy contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s 2025 administration has intensified a two\u2011pronged strategy against China, using aggressive tariffs to pressure Beijing while reshoring supply chains and boosting domestic manufacturing, especially in semiconductors and AI. The administration frames these measures as essential for national security, arguing that China\u2019s control of rare earths, semiconductors, and critical pharmaceuticals threatens U.S. sovereignty and economic resilience. Trump\u2019s rhetoric emphasizes steadfast negotiation, faith\u2011based resolve, and a willingness to accept short\u2011term consumer price hikes for long\u2011term strategic gains. The policy has sparked criticism over its impact on allies and domestic costs, but Trump maintains that the tariffs are a necessary tool to secure fair trade terms and protect American technological leadership.",
