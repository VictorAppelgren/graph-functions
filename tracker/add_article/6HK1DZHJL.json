      "summary": "The article discusses the SAS Weekly Treasury Simulation for August 29, 2025, highlighting that forward rates include a risk premium beyond market expectations for the 3‑month forward rate. It notes that the simulation tracks U.S. Treasury yields and spreads, and references a free trial of The Corporate Bond Investor, which ranks corporate bonds by reward‑to‑risk using modern big‑data default probabilities. The piece also mentions the steady rate cuts anticipated in the near term and provides a brief overview of the simulation’s methodology and its relevance to investors.",
