  "description": "China\u2019s communist government engaged in \u201cgenocide and crimes against humanity\u201d involving minority and religious groups, according to the State Department\u2019s annual report on human rights.",
  "content": "China\u2019s communist government engaged in \u201cgenocide and crimes against humanity\u201d involving minority and religious groups, according to the State Department\u2019s annual report on human rights.\n\nThe genocide involved Muslim Uyghurs in western China and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, the westernmost province.\n\nDespite critics who say the latest report may have watered down human rights abuses in nations friendly to the United States, the report continued its harsh assessment of Beijing\u2019s abuses.\n\n\u201cSignificant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings; disappearances; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; involuntary or coercive medical or psychological practices; arbitrary arrest and detention by the government including, since 2017 of more than one million Uyghurs and members of other predominantly Muslim minority groups in extrajudicial internment camps, prisons,\u201d the annual report stated.\n\nAn additional unknown number of people were subjected to \u201cre-education\u201d training and acts of transnational repression against individuals in other nations.\n\nChina also imposes serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, including unjustified arrests and criminal prosecution of journalists, lawyers, writers, bloggers, dissidents, petitioners, and others, and restrictions on internet freedom.\n\nReligious repression involves restrictions of religious freedom and the report also noted instances of coerced abortions and forced sterilization, despite China\u2019s new policy of seeking to promote population growth, the report said.\n\nChina is also involved in human trafficking and forced labor, including \u201csome of the worst forms of child labor,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe Beijing government failed to take steps or action to identify or punish officials linked to the widespread human rights abuses.\n\nChinese state media said the report \u201cbaselessly criticizes China\u201d regarding genocide in Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. administration truly cares about the human rights of Muslims, why does it turn a blind eye to the hell on earth in Gaza?\u201d the outlet China Daily said.\n\nThe latest report was restructured to remove redundancy, increase readability and respond to legislative mandates, the State Department said in releasing the report this week.\n\nThe new report is no longer an \u201cexpansive list of politically biased demands and assertions,\u201d spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said.\n\nOn the subject of extrajudicial killings, the report said reports had surfaced alleging government agents committed arbitrary and unlawful killings last year.\n\nIn one case in Xinjiang, a Chinese media report that was quickly censored after publication last year, stated that eight Xinjiang police officers were on trial for the torture and ultimate death of Sun Renze, a private citizen, while in police custody in 2018.\n\nVideo surveillance reportedly documented the torture of the victim, including waterboarding and other physical abuse.\n\nThe report said there were also other deaths of people in official custody in Xinjiang in mass internment camps.\n\nChina\u2019s government has denied it is engaged in genocide of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\n\nThe State Department initially declared the genocide in 2021.\n\nChina also engaged in coercive population control in 2024. Married couples are limited to three children, up from two allowed in 2021.\n\nA fourth child can be permitted if couples meet government requirements.\n\nIn a section on war crimes and crimes against humanity, the report identified \u201cderadicalization\u201d programs in Xinjiang that use a broad definition of extremism to imprison more than 1 million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims in re-education or detention centers.\n\nThe forced re-education programs seek to instill patriotism and erase local religious, cultural, and ethnic identities.\n\nMany of the victims held in these centers were later moved to prisons after convictions based on what the report said were spurious charges in closed trials that resulted in long prison terms.\n\nChina\u2019s government also \u201cpromoted racism and institutional discrimination against minorities, in particular Uyghurs, and disparaged and denied the resulting complaints, cracking down on peaceful expressions of ethnic culture and religion,\u201d the report said.\n\nChina also denies freedom of speech, press and assembly despite constitutional guarantees.\n\nChinese Communist Party authorities maintained tight control over all print, broadcast, electronic and social media and regularly used them to propagate government views and CCP ideology.\n\nExtensive censorship is also imposed on all media, especially around anniversaries such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and China\u2019s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nViolations of the CCP\u2019s strict censorship, monitored by extensive electronic monitoring, resulted in punitive measures for people and their families.\n\nOne Chinese newspaper editor, Dong Yuyu was imprisoned for seven years on espionage charges after meeting a Japanese diplomat in a hotel.\n\n\u201cAuthorities arrested or detained countless citizens for \u2018spreading fake news,\u2019 \u2018illegal information dissemination,\u2019 or \u2018spreading rumors online,\u2019\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThese claims ranged from sharing political views or promoting so-called religious extremism to sharing factual reports on public health concerns.\u201d\n\nCCP censorship is especially severe regarding Chinese President Xi Jinping. Censors aggressively shut down images of the Winnie the Pooh cartoon character on social media after internet users used it as indirect criticism of Mr. Xi.",
