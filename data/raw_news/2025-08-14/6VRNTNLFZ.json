  "content": "Nottingham Forest are in the process of agreeing a \u00a337.5m fee with Ipswich Town for Omari Hutchinson.\n\nThe club-to-club talks have reached an advanced stage after Forest\u2019s opening bid worth \u00a335million was rejected but dialogue continued. Personal terms for Hutchinson are no issue.\n\nHutchinson made 32 appearances, recording three goals and two assists, in all competitions last season as Ipswich finished 19th in the Premier League and were relegated to the second tier. Hutchinson spent time in Chelsea\u2019s academy before coming through Arsenal\u2019s youth system. He rejoined Chelsea in 2022 but only made two appearances for the first team.\n\nThe winger was loaned to Ipswich for the 2023-24 season and featured in 50 games in all competitions that season, starting 25, helping Ipswich earn promotion to the top flight for the first time in 22 years. He then joined the club permanently last summer as their record signing, in a deal worth up to \u00a322.5m.\n\nHutchinson has represented England at under-21 level and was part of the team that won the Under-21 European Championship in June this year. He has also featured twice at senior level for Jamaica, making his debut in March 2023 as a 19-year-old.\n\nForest have already broken their transfer record once in recent weeks with the \u00a335million capture of Dan Ndoye from Bologna.\n\nThe fact they are willing to do so again to land another young player with significant potential is a sign of the club\u2019s determination to arm Nuno Espirito Santo with a competitive squad ahead of what could be a huge campaign for the club.\n\nForest are also pushing hard to complete the signing of McAtee and Kalimuendo, with hopes that the Englishman in particular should sign before Forest face Brentford in their opening Premier League game on Sunday.\n\nForest have given themselves some PSR wriggle room with the \u00a352m sale of Anthony Elanga to Newcastle United this summer. But the club know that they need to add strength in depth as they prepare for a return to European football after three decades without it.\n\nIt was confirmed on Monday that Forest will complete in the Europa League and the pursuit of players like Hutchinson \u2014 a young forward with Premier League experience with the potential to see both his stock and his value rise at the City Ground \u2014 would fit perfectly into the club\u2019s blueprint.",

      "text": "Nottingham Forest are close to a deal for Manchester City midfielder James McAtee.\nNothing has been agreed at this stage but talks are moving in a positive direction.\nMcAtee, 22, is available on a permanent transfer this summer and The Athletic reported in the DealSheet in July he had attracted interest from England and Germany, with Nottingham Forest among his admirers.\nAdvertisement\nEintracht Frankfurt were also keen on the England youth international, having followed him since at least January.\nForest see McAtee as capable of playing as a No 8 or No 10, and Nuno Espirito Santo has been keen to strengthen in midfield this summer following the sales of Danilo and Lewis O\u2019Brien to Botafogo and Wrexham respectively.\nForest have been in talks with Milan over a move for Yunus Musah, while the club had also been weighing up a move for Douglas Luiz of Juventus.\nMcAtee was named as the England captain for the Under-21 European Championship this summer, as Lee Carsley\u2019s side defended their title, a tournament he chose over the Club World Cup with City.\nHe made 27 appearances in all competitions for City last season but started just three times in the Premier League. The midfielder scored seven goals, including a hat-trick in City\u2019s 8-0 FA Cup third round win over Salford City.\nHis Manchester City contract runs until 2026.\nMcAtee is a product of the City academy and spent the 2022-23 and 2023-24 campaigns on loan at Sheffield United, helping them to promotion to the Premier League, before their relegation back to their second tier the following season.\nForest will play in the Europa League next season after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) dismissed Crystal Palace\u2019s appeal against their demotion to the Conference League on Monday.\nWhy are Nottingham Forest targeting McAtee?\nMcAtee would tick one of the major boxes that Nuno Espirito Santo likes to see in his players \u2014 the ability to operate in more than one position.\nThe 22-year-old has played many of his games on the right, but is also capable of operating as a number 10 or even as an orthodox midfielder.\nHe would add another option on the flank, at a time when Forest are seeking to adjust to the departure of both Anthony Elanga (to Newcastle United, \u00a352million) and Ramon Sosa (to Palmeiras, \u00a310million).\nAdvertisement\nBut he could also serve as a useful back-up option to Morgan Gibbs-White.\nMore broadly, he fits the bill when it comes to the kind of player Forest like to sign \u2014 a young player who is already Premier League ready, but who is armed with the potential to further improve.\nMcAtee is a highly regarded figure at City, where he scored seven goals in 27 appearances in all competitions last season, which was his first as a squad player for the club.\nHis two loan spells at Sheffield United included 30 Premier League appearances for the Blades, during the 2023-24 campaign.\n(Photo: Carl Recine/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Nottingham Forest are in talks with AC Milan over a move for midfielder Yunus Musah.\nClub-to-club talks are taking place and if those negotiations lead to an agreement, personal terms for the U.S. international are not expected to be an issue.\nMusah, who has played 80 games for Milan across two seasons, started in each of his side\u2019s friendlies this weekend \u2014 Saturday\u2019s match against Leeds United in Dublin and against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.\nThe 22-year-old joined Milan from Valencia in the summer of 2023 despite interest from Premier League clubs Fulham and West Ham United.\nMassimiliano Allegri has returned to Milan as head coach following a turbulent campaign, in which the 19-time Italian champions recorded an eighth-place league finish and lost the Coppa Italia final to Bologna.\nMilan also appointed Igli Tare as their new sporting director. Tare said of Musah\u2019s future earlier this summer: \u201cI consider Musah an excellent player, but we are looking for profiles with characteristics that fit the project we have with coach Allegri.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe are seeking deep-lying midfielders for a three-man midfield. Musah doesn\u2019t have these characteristics. He can play in a two or three-man midfield but with different characteristics. This is the real reason why we want to do something different.\u201d\nForest had also been weighing up a move for Douglas Luiz of Juventus, with head coach Nuno Espirito Santo keen to add a midfielder to his squad following the sales of Danilo and Lewis O\u2019Brien to Botafogo and Wrexham respectively.\nForest have signed four players so far in this summer window, with Bologna\u2019s Dan Ndoye, Botafogo duo Igor Jesus and Jair Cunha, and goalkeeper Angus Gunn all joining Nuno\u2019s squad.\nThe midfielder came through Arsenal\u2019s academy before joining Valencia in 2019. Musah made 108 appearances for Valencia over three seasons, scoring five goals.\nMusah, who represented England up to under-18 level, has played 47 senior matches for the U.S. since making his debut, aged 17.\nHe, alongside Pulisic, was omitted from Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s squad for this summer\u2019s Concacaf Gold Cup.\nMilan begin their season with a Coppa Italia tie against Bari on August 17 before opening their Serie A campaign against Cremonese six days later.\n(Joe Puetz/ISI Photos/Getty Images)"
