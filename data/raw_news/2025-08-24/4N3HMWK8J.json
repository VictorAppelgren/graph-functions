  "content": "Bradley Cooper and Gigi Hadid are taking their love on the road!\n\nThe dynamic duo were spotted at JFK Airport in New York City on Aug 23 on their way to a late-summer vacation. (You can see the photos here.) The 30-year-old supermodel looked casually chic in jeans paired with a white T-shirt and a bright pink cardigan. She had her hair artfully styled, half-up, half-down, and wore layered gold necklaces to complete the look. The 50-year-old actor wore khakis, a black jacket, and a black baseball cap for his travel day.\n\u2022 None Ellen DeGeneres & Portia de Rossi Prove Their UK Countryside Life Is Straight Out of a Fairytale\n\nThe sighting comes on the heels of a July report from Page Six that their relationship is on a very serious path. Apparently, Cooper is \u201cconsidering marriage and kids with Gigi\u201d and \u201che might pop the question in the next couple of months,\u201d according to an insider.\n\nCooper is already a dad to his daughter, Lea, 8, whom he shares with his ex-girlfriend, Irina Shayk. Hadid is a mom to daughter Khai, 4, whom she shares with ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik. \u201cThey could picture a blended family with their daughters and their own kids,\u201d the source added.\n\nWith this marriage buzz also comes hints from Hadid\u2019s Instagram page. She went Instagram official with her boyfriend in May. Even though his snapshot was buried deep into the carousel, the message was clear \u2014 they are in a loving and committed relationship.\n\n\u201cI feel so lucky to be 30! I feel so lucky for every high and low- for all the lessons and gifts both have brought me. To get to feel it all! I\u2019m so lucky to be a mom, friend, partner, sister, daughter, colleague to some of the most unbelievable humans,\u201d she wrote in the caption with a cryptic message to Cooper as her \u201cpartner.\u201d\n\nThe Page Six source described the power couple as \u201cincredibly happy and are in their own bubble.\u201d Hadid gushed about their romance to Vogue in March, and that should have been a big sign that a proposal could be in the works at any time.\n\n\u201cI think just getting to the point where knowing what you want and deserve in a relationship is essential,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then to find someone that is in a place in their life where they know what they want and deserve\u2026and you both do work separately to come together and be the best partner that you can be. I just feel really lucky. Yeah, lucky\u2019s the word.\u201d\n\nCooper and Hadid\u2019s sweet love is no secret, and an engagement might be on the horizon.\n\nBefore you go, click here to see famous men who routinely date women half their age.\n\u2022 None 52 Celebrity Couples Who Aren't Afraid of a Little PDA\n\u2022 None 32 Best Teen Movies From the 2000s That Still Hold Up\n\u2022 None 14 Documentaries About Real-Life Cults That Will Blow Your Mind\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.

      "text": "You can drive 90 minutes from New York City and feel as though you\u2019ve never left. Same restaurants, same people, same conversations, same outfits. And then you can drive 90 minutes from Manhattan and feel like you\u2019re in a different country: dense woods, streams running alongside unpaved roads, warnings tacked to telephone poles cautioning deer hunters against trespassing. There might be a few gourmet markets and inns with minimalist, sans serif signs, but on the January day I visit Gigi Hadid in rural Pennsylvania, the only notable landmark I see anywhere near her home is a humble gas station.\n\u201cWelcome!\u201d Hadid shouts from the doorstop of a long, low house nestled into the surrounding hills. It\u2019s a modern structure, but made with reclaimed materials and wide windows that frame the landscape. The spaces inside are clean but scattered with the clutter of parenting and life in general: unopened cardboard boxes, mugs on the kitchen counter, photos of a trip to Disney World. Hadid\u2014tall, slender, and makeup-free\u2014is dressed in black Nike sweatpants and a pullover from her cashmere knitwear line, Guest in Residence, her hair pulled up halfway.\nA blanket of snow covers the ground and icicles hang from the eaves, but inside the fire is blazing and it seems like every room has a candle lit. She has been in the area for about eight years, she tells me, ever since she bought a converted lavender farm with her mother, Yolanda, and sister, Bella, in 2017. I ask her why she moved out here in the first place\u2014entry-grade small talk, but Hadid answers candidly: \u201cIt just kind of got to a point in my career where there started to be cameras outside every day in New York. And there was a darkness to that for me.\u201d\nThe image of the Hadids in Pennsylvania is not a new one: Gigi and Bella are horse girls, transplanted from the canyons of Malibu to the pastures of Bucks County, digging in the herb garden or swatting mosquitoes on Instagram Live. As we settle on her couch, however, I sense that Gigi wants to tell the story of how she arrived here more fully. Yes, this was a place to ride out the pandemic, then a bucolic backdrop for the early days of her now four-year-old daughter Khai\u2019s life. But the escape was also a necessity. Her fame, as one of the first \u201cInstagram models,\u201d came with boundary-breaking invasions of her privacy. And she is direct about the toll: \u201cIt got to a place where I would have three days off, and I would stay inside for three days. And that\u2019s very intense.\u201d When I speak by phone to John, her head of security for almost a decade (who prefers we only give his first name), he describes a particularly grueling set of days some years back. Her plan had been just to hide in her apartment to recover\u2014but that wouldn\u2019t do, John decided, and he figured out a way to get her to the beach with a friend. \u201cThe two girls were just in the ocean all day, and we drove back to the city later that evening,\u201d John recalls. \u201cI think things like that were able to reenergize her, to allow her to feel\u2014I really hate to use the word normal, but sometimes her world is a little off-center, for sure.\u201d\nA stolen beach day was an aberration, though. \u201cI felt like, even when I was just trying to put on something casual and go get coffee or go to the pharmacy, to get outside, someone had a comment: Why is she dressed like that? She looks like a slob. She looks overworked, whatever,\u201d Hadid says. She is also blunt about the attention paid to her body: She\u2019s too heavy or She has an eating disorder were the kinds of things she regularly heard. \u201cI\u2019ve been called every name in the book,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so I phoned my mom one day and I was like, \u2018Hey, I need somewhere to go.\u2019 \u201d We have been together for no more than 20 minutes, but she becomes emotional, her words catching in her throat. The experience she is describing may have occurred years ago, but it is still raw and painful. \u201cI learned the hard way,\u201d Hadid says of the access she offered people early in her career. \u201cThere were times in the beginning where I gave too much.\u201d\nIt can be a little easy to forget that we have known Gigi Hadid for so long\u2014ever since she was a leggy teenage volleyball player, stalking through her mother\u2019s kitchen in the background of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. (\u201cI didn\u2019t even really know those women,\u201d she says now. \u201cIt was such a minute part of my life.\u201d)\nBut there was a time when fame, or even a career in modeling, felt far from inevitable. It\u2019s well-known that Hadid had her first modeling job when she was two (for Baby Guess, a connection through her mother); less well-known, perhaps, is that her mother all but forbade any further modeling work until Hadid was late into her teens so that her daughter could focus on other things: sports, school, friends, musical theater. As Hadid tells it now, when she was deciding where to go to college, she gave almost equal consideration to the idea of playing collegiate volleyball as to modeling. The summer before she enrolled at the New School in Manhattan, she spent a month in London, \u201cdoing test shoots with different photographers in creepy basements, taking long Tube rides to random go-sees,\u201d she says. Then, in her two years as an undergraduate, she studied criminal psychology and was immediately invested in her classes. \u201cWhen I was a kid, and had to stay home from school sick, I\u2019d watch Forensic Files or the Food Network.\u201d (Culinary school was, and actually still is, another possibility\u2014she loves to cook.) Anything she did\u2014and this is a theme\u2014she wanted to do fully. \u201cIn volleyball,\u201d says Hadid\u2019s high school club coach, Aaron Wexler, who still coaches but also has a podcast, Within the Game, \u201cyou can hit really hard or you can tip\u201d\u2014a softer, more strategic move. \u201cAnd Gigi told me one time\u2014I\u2019ll never forget\u2014\u2018I\u2019m not tipping, Coach.\u2019 She was like, \u2018I\u2019m going for it.\u2019 \u201d (Her accuracy, Wexler tells me, was less assured, but it didn\u2019t stop her.)\nIn the earliest part of her career, Hadid had a young agent at IMG who she felt didn\u2019t take her seriously, and so she worked up the courage to email the head of the agency that she wanted more than \u201ca buddy who\u2019s going to go to fashion parties with me.\u201d That led her to Luiz Mattos, whom she met in the elevator of the IMG offices on her way into their meeting. The chemistry was immediate. \u201cI was like, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s talk about our goals for the next five years,\u2019 \u201d says Mattos, who has represented Hadid for more than a decade. \u201cAnd she looked at me like, Oh my God, you think I can do this? I\u2019m like, I know you can.\u201d\nHer career started to accelerate. Donatella Versace was an early champion. She was one of the first, as Hadid puts it, \u201cto be like, \u2018Your athletic volleyball body is the sexiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019 even though that wasn\u2019t really the opinion at the time in fashion.\u201d In her, Versace saw something of the iconic supermodels she had helped launch in the \u201990s: \u201cThe Supers were defined by their individuality, their personality, their strength, and the fact that they celebrated that in editorials and on the runway,\u201d Versace says. \u201cGigi for me has that same spirit.\u201d\nHadid considers it all somewhat serendipitous: She was the right girl for a vibe-shift moment, when culture was moving away from untouchable, unreachable models. And in the meantime, she was having a lot of fun, circulating in a freewheeling New York creative scene. She was then and still is good friends with the artist Austyn Weiner, whom she first met in San Francisco on a tour bus in 2013, when both girls were dating musicians. Weiner and her boyfriend at the time were hanging out, \u201cbeing very rambunctious\u2014very Almost Famous,\u201d Weiner says. (\u201cThe epitome of a California rock-and-roll artist girlfriend,\u201d is how Hadid describes her first impression of Weiner.) \u201cAnd I think I kind of immediately became this safe space in this very new environment for her,\u201d Weiner says.\nWeiner had the idea to splatter an 18-year-old Gigi with acrylic paint and shoot her for a series she called Cover, Girl. \u201cWe put her in my little Chinatown apartment shower. There was hardly any warm water. She\u2019ll always say it\u2019s the worst she\u2019s ever been treated on a shoot,\u201d Weiner jokes. \u201cI was so young, and it was an honor to be in front of anyone\u2019s camera,\u201d counters Hadid, \u201clet alone my friend and someone whose art I really loved.\u201d The work, says Weiner, \u201cwas a stamp of a moment in time, but it also was the beginning of our relationship being centered around art.\u201d Their friendship has since been girded by creative projects. \u201cMy world is centered around creation\u2014and, in a completely different medium, so is hers,\u201d says Weiner.\nWhat does Hadid create? Editorial shoots, viral runway moments, and fashion campaigns\u2014but she has also gently stepped out of this more prescribed lane. In 2023 she cohosted the second season of Netflix\u2019s reality show Next in Fashion with her friend Tan France. In one episode, she judged contestants alongside Versace, and was so nervous that her hands shook, France recalls. It only lasted one episode; \u201cShe knew she nailed it,\u201d France says. These endeavors might be just mid-20s professional excursions\u2014albeit of a glamorous variety\u2014or they may be the sketch of a future beyond modeling. A clue lies in the quiet, thoughtful way she launched her first real business venture without her name sewn into the labels or explicitly advertised on the items, as though she wants to test her instincts and acumen in this world without coasting (solely) on her fame. One could, in theory, wander into a Guest in Residence store and not know it has anything to do with her.\nAnd then there\u2019s the creative care Hadid applies to her personal life, particularly as a mother. In Pennsylvania, she tells me that she and Khai have recently been picking colors to dress in\u2014head to toe. In her bathroom there are plastic tubs filled with toys\u2014for their \u201cshower parties.\u201d A nook under a staircase has been converted into a jungle-themed play space, complete with fake vines. \u201cI could see Khai was interested in it,\u201d Hadid says of the neglected crawl space, \u201cso one week when she was at her dad\u2019s, I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to go to Target and pimp this out.\u2019 \u201d\nKhai\u2019s dad is Hadid\u2019s ex, the singer Zayn Malik, with whom she co-parents. The two dated for about six years, and their relationship was followed with rabid interest\u2014particularly toward its conclusion (the details of which you can look up, though it\u2019s clear from talking to Hadid that they are very much in the past). Hadid flicks through the photos on her phone, showing me scenes of Malik holding Khai on the first day of pre-K, and describing the innate musicality Khai gets from her father. \u201cZayn and I do our custody schedules months in advance,\u201d Hadid says, planning everything around the weeks they have Khai. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t change here and there, but we help each other out and have each other\u2019s backs.\u201d She and Malik have entered this new phase of their partnership with \u201clove, and a feeling of camaraderie,\u201d she says, accepting\u2014more or less\u2014that their relationship will likely forever be under some kind of microscope. \u201cThere is the hard part of the world knowing this much, and thinking they know everything,\u201d says Hadid. \u201cAnd at the end of the day, we\u2019re not interested in giving everyone our whole story. What we are interested in is raising our daughter together, with so much respect for each other, and not just as co-parents, but what we\u2019ve been through together.\u201d\nShe hands me a heavy Carhartt coat to wear outside (my jacket is in the car), and as we tramp across the snow, she stops and leans over an open grate. \u201cHello,\u201d she says, bending over to peer into it. \u201cThere\u2019s a frog friend living down there. Khai likes to talk to him.\u201d Nestled between giant stacks of firewood, there is a fairy village, dreamed up by Hadid; a playhouse that she and Khai painted with pink and white stripes sits next to a climbing gym. At the back of the property, I see a small stream; in the summer they will scoop clay for pottery from its banks.\nBeing a mother \u201chas only made her more of herself,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cGigi doesn\u2019t want to be in a club in the city on a Tuesday night.\u201d Hadid tours me through the craft room, a long, glass-sided space that overlooks the pool, where pom-poms and ice-pop sticks and googly eyes are arranged in glass canisters like gumballs at a candy store. Khai is able to paint on one of the walls in the room; it seems to have had the effect of preventing a mess elsewhere, Hadid tells me, though this is a house where it feels like a mess might sometimes be encouraged.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing she\u2019s done\u2014created a space out here where she can give Khai the most normal experience possible,\u201d says Adrienne Tosti, who describes herself as \u201cGigi\u2019s five-two, stay-at-home-mom friend,\u201d and Hadid describes, simply, as one of her best friends. Tosti moved to Pennsylvania with her husband when she was pregnant, and met Hadid at a local mommy-and-me class: \u201cMy daughter was in an Elsa nightgown princess dress,\u201d says Tosti, \u201cand Khai was also in something Elsa related, and they looked at each other and were like, Okay, we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d She and Hadid spend a large portion of their parenting hours together, it seems, parked at the pool in the summer, going to the trampoline park, taking their daughters into the city to visit the Natural History Museum. \u201cWe get the schedule, and we\u2019re like, Okay, so what are we going to do Monday?\u201d says Tosti.\nHadid describes hers as a kind of double life, a way she has of inhabiting distinct identities from day to day. \u201cI joke with my mom friends that I feel like the Hannah Montana of fashion,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you just met me at a photo shoot, you wouldn\u2019t see a full depiction of me. I feel that as a model, I\u2019m a performer. And I don\u2019t think that seeing me walk into random places around here,\u201d she gestures at the landscape, \u201cscreams supermodel.\u201d\nAs much as motherhood has given Hadid a life away from modeling, it has also helped her chart a path through fame. Because she splits her time between Pennsylvania and New York, it\u2019s no longer really worth the paparazzi\u2019s time to camp out at her Manhattan apartment. At the same time, she has developed a remarkable degree of equanimity about her own exposure\u2014\u201cThis is part of the job; when you\u2019re a public figure, it comes with the territory,\u201d she says.\nWhen it comes to Khai, though, she is firm. After her daughter was born, Hadid wrote an open letter to the paparazzi\u2014a moderate plea that requested they obscure Khai\u2019s face. \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow up walking out of our house thinking, What angle could someone be watching me from?\u201d Hadid says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not something I want to be part of her train of thought.\u201d The letter did not, of course, change everything. If she notices a photographer while they are in the park, she bundles Khai into the stroller, pulls down the sun shade, and makes a game of it: Let\u2019s see how quickly we can get home! But post-letter, there are a handful of photographers who, when they see Hadid with Khai, put down their cameras.\nHow much of her daughter to share on her own social media is an internal negotiation. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be fully genuine to post nothing of Khai,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I also don\u2019t want to put anything up that would take away from her privacy and her peace.\u201d I ask her if she\u2019s ever tempted to give up on social media entirely, but it is clearly not in her nature. \u201cI\u2019ll go to Paris, and there\u2019s people in front of shows that have been fans of mine for 10 years. And I love that. I love connecting with people.\u2026 I am grateful for social media, and the ways that it has connected me to the world. I wouldn\u2019t have the same career without it.\u201d The pressures and anxieties and benefits of social media are clearly matters she\u2019s thought a lot about, and she even texts me later to elaborate: \u201cMy Instagram is like snail mail,\u201d she says, \u201cif you follow me, you have to be patient, life has to load.\u2026 It\u2019s different from how socials felt when I was younger. It doesn\u2019t come as naturally to me as it did when Instagram started.\u201d\nHadid credits therapy and just getting older with helping her balance the people-pleasing, hard-working parts of her personality with the desire to \u201chave respect for myself.\u201d She now finds it easier to say no, and even finds power in asserting the reason: \u201cI have no regrets, ever, being like, \u2018I can\u2019t make that job. I have Khai that week.\u2019 That\u2019s just the boundary I\u2019ve set.\u201d Again, Hadid comes to the brink of tears as she describes the life she has built for her daughter in this quiet enclave\u2014the secret jungles and painted playhouses, but, more importantly, the community. \u201cKhai is protected by our friendships here. And that means,\u201d she pauses, visibly emotional, \u201cthat means a lot to me.\u201d\nHadid drives me to a deli to pick up sandwiches for lunch, speeding along the icy roads with confidence, chatting about the inauguration (she watched\u2014and thinks it\u2019s important not to stick your head in the sand, no matter your politics), exercise (she\u2019s an athlete still, has been texting Coach Wexler, and has even gone so far as to investigate adult volleyball leagues in the area), and the Broadway shows she\u2019s attended lately (\u201cSweeney Todd\u2014incredible\u2014for two weeks, I was marching around the streets of New York to \u2018The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\u2019 \u201d). Wicked\u2014which she has seen 10 times\u2014is her favorite musical. A humble suggestion for Jon Chu: Cast her in one of the sequels. \u201cI don\u2019t just want to go act in TV and movies as, like, the boring girlfriend,\u201d Hadid says. Would she try theater? \u201cIt\u2019s like a dream,\u201d she almost whispers, \u201cthat\u2019s scary to say to you.\u201d\n\u201cBradley\u201d\u2014that would be Bradley Cooper, her boyfriend of more than a year\u2014\u201chas opened me up to going to the theater more, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s so nice to bring back into my life.\u201d She and Cooper met at a backyard birthday party for the child of a mutual friend, which seems, somewhat ironically given its quotidian dimensions, the best place to meet if you are two world-famous celebrities trying to date. \u201cYou want to give yourself a normal experience of dating,\u201d Hadid says, \u201cand even for my friends who aren\u2019t public figures, that\u2019s hard. Where do you go? And, what? You just start talking to people? And then there\u2019s another added layer of privacy and security. You want to believe that people are going to have your back and not call TMZ or go on Deuxmoi or whatever, but you just don\u2019t know.\u201d\nWhatever strange dance dating as a supermodel might require, she describes her relationship now as \u201cvery romantic and happy,\u201d though there are parts of it she wants to keep to herself, not because there is anything especially secretive about it, but because \u201cit\u2019s just not part of our relationship to share for whatever reason.\u201d She\u2019s aware that people\u2014those unnamed \u201csources\u201d upon which an entire ecosystem of clickbait headlines rests\u2014will provide information \u201cthat\u2019s kind of right and kind of wrong,\u201d she says. But \u201cyou just have to let it go; you can\u2019t always correct everything.\u201d\nWhat she does tell me about this relationship makes it seem like it might not have taken place at an earlier stage in her life. \u201cI think just getting to the point where knowing what you want and deserve in a relationship is essential,\u201d she says, \u201cand then to find someone that is in a place in their life where they know what they want and deserve\u2026and you both do work separately to come together and be the best partner that you can be. I just feel really lucky. Yeah, lucky\u2019s the word.\n\u201cI respect him so much as a creative,\u201d she continues, \u201cand I feel that he gives so much to me: encouragement and, just, belief. For those people you admire to encourage you, it can create so much belief in yourself. Like, what\u2019s the worst thing if I auditioned for this? You jump and take the leap.\u201d\nThe next day, eight flights up, in a bright, whitewashed studio on the West Side of Manhattan, Gigi Hadid is not quite leaping, but radiating some of the energy of the musical theater kid she once was, performing for the camera. \u201cI have always been impressed by Gigi,\u201d says Miuccia Prada, another one of her early champions. \u201cShe is incredibly professional and charming at the same time, always in a good mood and gentle. She holds a special place not only in the world of fashion and has done so for a long time. It is the result of the hard work and the commitment she puts into all she does.\u201d\nHadid is shooting the spring-summer looks for Guest in Residence; the new collection will launch just 10 days later. The studio is littered with props: water guns, Hula-Hoops, foam pool noodles, flip-flops, New Balance sneakers with the laces untied. The theme of the shoot is \u201cpostcard from nowhere,\u201d or, perhaps more aptly, anywhere the sun shines. Today, it is 20-something degrees outside, but a pool day in the studio.\nHadid has layered her own narrative onto the concept. \u201cHe\u2019s coming back soon,\u201d she croons in falsetto, draping herself over a giant beach ball. She is a mid-century astronaut\u2019s wife, gazing up at Sputnik and nursing a martini. It\u2019s a little bit plastic, a little bit Stepford. One gets the sense that the other models in the shoot, game as they are, haven\u2019t quite caught the high-speed train of her narrative, even though she\u2019s sweetly explaining it to them. Initially, the idea had been for her hair to be quite natural, she tells me, but she had her stylist, Dimitris Giannetos, shellac it into a Mary Tyler Moore\u2013style flipped-up bob, a smile of a hairdo. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the cupcakes,\u201d Hadid belts out more than once while the shutter snaps. \u201cDoes everyone know that I brought cupcakes?\u201d\nGuest in Residence employees, from the summer intern turned marketing coordinator to the e-commerce manager, filter in. Apart from the core people involved in the shoot\u2014Rossella Raffi, the chief marketing officer; Hadid\u2019s business partner Isaac Ross; the art director Paolo Santosuosso\u2014it doesn\u2019t feel like the staff needs to be there, but they settle comfortably along the sidelines nonetheless. With Hadid, says Guest in Residence design director Sijeo Kim, \u201cit\u2019s not like, Okay, I have all the authority, so you do this,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s more like, We\u2019re in this together. Let\u2019s talk about the idea.\u201d Kim describes meeting Hadid for the first time at her apartment; she was carefully dressed in supporting-staff black, while Gigi was in a leather jacket with a power shoulder\u2014both of them now aware that they were trying out roles.\nHadid sits down next to us as Kim tells the story; it\u2019s lunchtime and a plate of Middle Eastern food is balanced on her knees. \u201cA power shoulder\u2014very unlike me!\u201d she exclaims. Kim\u2019s voice was shaking during that first meeting as she showed Hadid samples of her earlier design work, \u201cand then Gigi was like, \u2018It\u2019s okay, my voice shakes all the time too.\u2019 \u201d Their relationship, like many of the initially professional relationships Hadid enters, has become personal. They have a long-running WhatsApp thread, where they send inspiration back and forth\u2014everything from Korean architecture to a T-shirt that has been a stalwart of Hadid\u2019s closet.\nRaffi, who traveled extensively with Hadid while they were promoting a collection she did with Tommy Hilfiger at the start of her career, describes a memorable trip to Tokyo, where they were besieged by crowds of fans, including a giant Gigi doll that followed them around the city. In the midst of it all, Hadid managed to organize a birthday dinner for Raffi. \u201cIt was an indication of who she is. She really pays attention, and she cherishes the team around her,\u201d says Raffi. \u201cThat makes you feel motivated. And it\u2019s also very rare.\u201d When the Guest in Residence staff has to stay late at their office, interfering with the cleaning crew\u2019s schedule, Hadid always makes a point to thank them, Raffi says. Hadid is conscious, though, that she can\u2019t build a company purely through cupcakes and birthday dinners: \u201cSometimes I have to say the thing that\u2019s hard to say and be the boss,\u201d Hadid tells me.\nWhen the shoot is over, Hadid quickly changes into cashmere Guest in Residence sweats. \u201cI\u2019m not a big shopper,\u201d she admits. \u201cMy wardrobe is really the basics that I\u2019ve been reworking.\u201d This was part of the motivation for Guest in Residence, she says. She wanted to sell things that will last and have less of an impact on the earth than most fashion. (She can geek out on cashmere quality and supply chains and how they are reseeding the fields where the cashmere goats graze.) She is both leader and student when it comes to Guest in Residence: One of her favorite things to do, when she has the time, is to stop by the store and investigate how people are approaching the clothes. \u201cI\u2019ll start asking people their size, if I can help them, and they just get so confused,\u201d she says. \u201cThey look at me like, Does she work here all the time?\u201d\nWe are blocks from the Shed, the exhibition space currently housing \u201cLuna Luna,\u201d a show of long-neglected amusement park rides designed by 20th century art icons like Keith Haring and Roy Lichtenstein, and I want her to visit the show. (She won\u2019t have time, of course. Her schedule, as I know, has been blocked months in advance.) Her love of theme parks is well documented, originating, she tells me, in trips to the fantastical Efteling in Holland with her Dutch mother when she was a child. \u201cIt really opened my mind\u2014not just about theme parks and rides, but some of my first memories of really looking around.\u201d Working with Karl Lagerfeld, in particular, she says, brought this back: \u201cWalking onto those Chanel sets\u2014I felt like a kid in an amusement park. It rang those same bells in my brain.\u201d When she texts later, she elaborates a bit more. Her work on Guest in Residence is striving to re-create this: \u201cOur conversation made me think of how putting myself in creative situations makes me feel like a kid again,\u201d she writes.\nIn a few months, Hadid will turn 30\u2014certainly no longer a kid\u2014and I ask her if she feels like a new chapter is beginning. (And for those who will be watching the slow roll of her social media feed: Yes, there will be a party, and she is thinking that she wants it to be formal, maybe with a theme, \u201csomething a little bit camp.\u201d) \u201cI\u2019m excited for 30,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like a lot of the stuff in my career, in my relationships, in my life, in my friendships, that people maybe normally go through in their 30s, I went through in my 20s.\u201d Her goal for the upcoming year is to do more of the things that scare her, that maybe make her hands shake just a bit. \u201cAfter 10 years of doing this job, I\u2019m not nervous anymore. I have to remember that if I feel scared or intimidated, that means I\u2019m excited. And yeah, at this point, why not try?\u201d\nI ask if it ever felt like things were moving a bit too fast for her\u2014in her career, but also in becoming a mom. \u201cFor a lot of moms there\u2019s this perfect image of what they\u2019re supposed to be and how it needs to go,\u201d she says, but for her and Khai, they are learning every day. \u201cWe grow together. You wake up and do your best and you realize it is enough, and there\u2019s a beauty in not necessarily knowing exactly how that\u2019s going to go.\u201d She pauses a moment, as though aware that this same sentiment could be applied to various inflection points in her career, relationships, parenting\u2014life in general. \u201cI think that\u2019s a huge lesson that I needed. And probably one of the reasons that Khai came to me. You can\u2019t always be in control. You can\u2019t always plan. You can look at an experience as the right or wrong time for anything, if that\u2019s your perspective. Now I just give myself the grace and look at how many things I\u2019ve handled. Step by step, I learned. I got through it.\u201d\nIn this story: hair, Orlando Pita; makeup, Francelle Daly; manicurist, Jin Soon Choi; tailors: Hailey Desjardins and Luis Cascante.

Then, once you\u2019ve made it through the entire six-part series, it\u2019s impossible to stave off your curiosity about other cults. What is it that makes certain people susceptible to such polarizing pedagogy? What leads a person to the \u201ccalling\u201d of a cult leader? And, most pressingly, can binge-watching documentaries about real-life cults offer any insight into the bizarre worlds inhabited by such people?\nThe lives of members of infamous cults, like the one chronicled in Wild Wild Country, make compelling fodder for limited television series and TV movies. So, you be the judge. Thanks to streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, it\u2019s easier than ever to take a psychedelic trip into the belief systems of cult leaders and their followers.\nWe\u2019ve gleaned quite a few mind-blowing examples to get you started. But be forewarned, the following documentaries may leave you with more questions than answers.\n-\n\u2018Wild Wild Country\u2019\nAn oft-forgotten piece of American history, the Oregon cult formed by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in the \u201980s made it abundantly clear why separation of church and state is so important (read: poisoning people to win an election is always a bad idea). The personalities examined in this jaw-dropping docu-series are so unfathomably eccentric that you almost forget that they\u2019re real, not fictional characters.\nWatch it on Netflix.\n-\n\u2018Children of God: Lost and Found\u2019\nThis documentary won\u2019t just blow your mind \u2014 it will break your heart, too. Filmmaker and reformed Children of God cult member Noah Thompson bravely seeks out other families whose lives were fractured by sexual abuse and bondage that children endured as part of \u201cThe Family.\u201d Interesting fact: Both Rose McGowan and Joaquin Phoenix were born into this cult but escaped with relatives before any lasting damage was done.\n-\n\u2018The Source Family\u2019\nFather Yod: That\u2019s how Jim Baker was known to his followers, who subscribed to their founder\u2019s hippy-dippy, hedonistic principles. In real life, he was a restaurateur and rumored bank robber \u2014 a man who accumulated people in an attempt to validate his bizarre delusions.\nWatch it on Tubi.\n-\n\u2018Waco: The Rules of Engagement\u2019\nCould the 1993 tragedy in Waco, Texas, have been prevented? William Gazecki\u2019s Oscar-nominated 1997 documentary immerses viewers in the Branch Davidians cult formed by David Koresh, as well as the standoff that resulted in the death of federal agents and 76 members of the religious sect.\nWatch it on Netflix.\n-\n\u2018Going Clear\u2019\nConsidered the definitive Scientology documentary, Alex Gibney\u2019s examination of the religion\u2019s history and controversial founder will leave you dumbfounded. The fact that several high-profile celebrities still openly identify as Scientologists? That may be just as mysterious as the tenets discussed in Going Clear.\nWatch it on Tubi.\n-\n\u2018Heaven\u2019s Gate: The Untold Story\u2019\nArguably one of the best-known cults, Heaven\u2019s Gate was a religious sect based out of San Diego that believed in, well, aliens. Confident that a UFO would save them all from certain death and deliver them to some existential plane of existence, 39 members participated in a mass suicide. Spoiler alert: The extraterrestrials didn\u2019t show.\n-\n\u2018Holy Hell\u2019\nWatch Will Allen\u2019s documentary about the Buddhafield movement, and you\u2019ll walk away with a serious case of the heebie-jeebies. A member of the cult for 22 years, Allen provides a chilling behind-the-scenes glimpse into life under founder Michel Rostand \u2014 who was eventually found to be guilty of forcing young men to have sex with him.\nWatch it on Tubi.\n-\n\u2018Jamestown: The Life and Death of People\u2019s Temple\u2019\nEver hear someone described as \u201cdrinking the Kool-Aid\u201d? The saying comes from the story of polygamist fundamentalist Jim Jones and his People\u2019s Temple. In 1978, the cult leader and almost all of his 900 followers committed mass suicide at their Guyana settlement by sipping poisoned drinks. Amy Berg\u2019s documentary includes interviews with former members as well as survivors of that fateful day.\nWatch it on Netflix.\n-\n\u2018Manson\u2019\nIf your skin doesn\u2019t crawl while watching this chilling 1973 documentary about Charles Manson, you\u2019re made of stronger stuff than us, friend. Go inside the Manson Family\u2019s Devil\u2019s Canyon compound with filmmakers Robert Hendrickson and Laurence Merrick for an unforgettable look at this murderous cult.\n-\n\u2018AUM: The Cult at the End of the World\u2019\nAUM: The Cult at the End of the World is quite shocking, and quite disturbing as we hear the story of Aum Shinrikyo, the doomsday cult from the 90s. If this cult sounds familiar, it\u2019s the cult that was behind the chemical domestic terrorist attack on March 1995, in Tokyo.\n-\n\u2018The Program: Cons, Cults, and Kidnapping\u2019\nThe Program: Cons, Cults, and Kidnapping is a very traumatic watch. We know it\u2019s a docuseries rather than a documentary, but it\u2019s a must-watch. It follows a woman \u201chaunted by her teenage experience at a troubled youth program,\u201d per IMDb. Now what program? It\u2019s the same one Paris Hilton was kidnapped into, and has used her celebrity status to help protect children from the pain she experienced at the same program.\nWatch it on Netflix.\n-\n\u2018Stolen Youth: Inside the Cult at Sarah Lawrence\u2019\nIn the 2023 docuseries, Stolen Youth: Inside the Cult at Sarah Lawrence, a group of Sarah Lawrence College students are influenced by Larry Ray, the father of a student. It goes into the whole story, from the beginning to what\u2019s happening today to the victims.\n-\n\u2018Escaping Twin Flames\u2019\nGet ready for a wild ride because in Netflix\u2019s Escaping Twin Flames we learn about the controversial Twin Flames Universe, a matchmaking service founded by Shaleia and Jeff Divine, that preyed on people looking for love. It\u2019s one of those wellness cults, and former members are revealing it all.\nWatch it on Netflix.\n-\n\u2018Hillsong: A Megachurch Exposed\u2019\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of Hillsong since it\u2019s been in the news for years for its controversial views and former celebrity members like Justin Bieber, the Kardashian-Jenner clan, and Vanessa Hudgens \u2014 but this documentary goes further..
