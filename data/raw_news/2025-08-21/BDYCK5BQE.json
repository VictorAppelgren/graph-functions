  "title": "'Maine's Mamdani': Maine GOP chief issues warning about new challenger looking to oust Susan Collins",
  "description": "Democrat Graham Platner, who is challenging GOP Sen. Susan Collins in Maine, is exporting Zohran Mamdani socialism to the state, a Republican leader says.",
  "content": "The latest addition to the pool of Democrats seeking to challenge Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is doubling down on Zohran Mamdani-style socialism, says the chief of Maine's Republican Party.\n\nDemocrat Graham Platner launched his campaign highlighting his history as an Army and Marine veteran as well as an oyster farmer, but state GOP chief Jason Savage told Fox News Digital that rural accolades aren't policy positions. He pointed to Platner's hiring of a top Mamdani adviser, Morris Katz, to produce his campaign launch video.\n\nIn that video, Platner rails against the \"oligarchy\" and endorses universal healthcare. His website features messaging that claims the U.S. has a \"billionaire economy,\" and that \u2013 if elected \u2013 Platner would view it as a key part of his job \"to dismantle\" it.\n\n\"Graham Platner is Maine's Mamdani,\" Savage told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"He brought in the Mamdani team to support his campaign. He's out doing a lot of work with socialist groups.\u2026 He's a Bernie bro.\"\n\nSENATE DEMOCRATS ARE FEVERISHLY RECRUITING TOP CANDIDATES TO WIN BACK MAJORITY IN 2026 MIDTERMS\n\n\"What we're seeing here is the exporting of the Mamdani ideology to the state of Maine because they think that they can gain ground in a small state where things aren't as expensive,\" he added.\n\n\"You can look through Graham Platner's donor history, and you can see that he donated to Harris for President, Bernie Sanders, Ilhan Omar,\" he continued, arguing that far-left candidates are a major threat to the Democratic Party.\n\nPlatner's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\n\n\"If common-sense Democrats, and then the leadership like [Sen.] Chuck Schumer don't do something and say that isn't the future of our party, then they're gonna run in a bunch of these races. and we're gonna beat them,\" he said.\n\nSavage argued that the Democratic Party's embracing of the far-left is a \"double-edged sword.\" He said Democratic candidates can't succeed without the \"extreme wing\" of the party, and now \"they've created a monster that they don't have the ability to control.\"\n\n\"In the long run, it's going to be catastrophic for them. I mean, Graham Platner advocates for allowing men to be in girls' and women's sports,\" Savage said. \"He advocates for all sorts of policies that are very, very unpopular, and the Democrats can't say anything to stop that.\"\n\nThe list against Collins is growing, and reports say those already in office are trying to tap Janet Mills, the state's 77-year-old Democratic governor, for the seat.\n\nRepublicans currently control the majority of by a 53-47 margin. Democrats would need to flip four seats in the 2026 midterm elections to take the majority.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA spokesperson for Collins told Fox News Digital that Platner is \"just another progressive entering the race.\"",

      "text": "U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has a new Democratic challenger more than a year before voters will take to the polls.\nGraham Platner, a combat veteran who served in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, announced his campaign on Tuesday morning. According to his online biography, Platner is currently the owner-operator of Waukeag Neck Oyster Co. His campaign video focused on taking on \"corrupt politicians\" and \"billionaires.\"\nDespite his military service, Maine Republicans were quick to condemn Platner as a \"far-left progressive.\"\nSENATE DEMOCRATS ARE FEVERISHLY RECRUITING TOP CANDIDATES TO WIN BACK MAJORITY IN 2026 MIDTERMS\n\"Graham is a far-left progressive backed by national progressive operatives and environmental extremists. His views would be perfectly suited for a Portland City Council race \u2013 not for representing all of Maine,\" Jason Savage, the executive director of the Maine Republican Party, said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\nPlatner's campaign Facebook page says he is a \"friend of the working Mainer, foe of the oligarchy.\" He already has more than a dozen town halls scheduled across the New England state.\n\"[E]very where I've gone, it seems like the fabric of what holds us together is being ripped apart by billionaires and corrupt politicians,\" Platner, 40, said in a campaign launch video.\n\"Profiting off of destroying our environment, driving our families into poverty and crushing the middle class,\" he said.\nPlatner went on to say he supports universal healthcare, aiding veterans and stopping funding for foreign wars. The video was produced by Morris Katz, a top advisor to the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, according to the New York Times.\n\"Being a Bernie Bro and Kamala Harris donor is a profile to appeal to Portland progressives, not centrist and conservative voters in rural Maine,\" Savage reportedly told the Times.\nTRUMP ALLY MIKE COLLINS LAUNCH KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE BID TO FLIP DEMOCRAT-HELD SENATE SEAT\nPlatner, a political newcomer, told Politico that he also brought on Joe Cavello, a former senior aide to Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., to help with his campaign.\n\"To call me a liberal, I think, is fairly amusing. I mean, I\u2019m a competitive pistol shooter. That\u2019s what I do on the weekends,\" he told the media outlet. \"I\u2019m a firearms instructor. I spent multiple years, obviously, in the service utilizing firearms.

      "text": "As they mount their uphill effort to win back the Senate majority in next year's midterm elections, Democrats feel that they're on a roll.\nLate last month, they landed their biggest recruit to date, when former two-term Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina declared his candidacy in the 2026 race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.\nDemocrats view the open Senate seat in the crucial southeastern battleground state as a top pick-up opportunity next year as they try to win back control of the Senate, which the Republicans currently hold with a 53-47 majority.\n\"It\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of getting Gov. Cooper to run for the Senate in North Carolina, and already we are seeing a potential for a ripple effect,\" longtime Democratic strategist Chris Moyer told Fox News Digital.\nTHIS REPUBLICAN JUST JUMPED INTO BATTLEGROUND GEORGIA'S HIGH-PROFILE SENATE RACE\nMoyer, a veteran campaign communicator, said that Cooper recruitment is \"giving more faith to potential candidates who are questioning whether there\u2019s a chance for a Democratic majority in the Senate next year.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) Chair Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, after landing Cooper, said he \"is a formidable candidate who will flip North Carolina\u2019s Senate seat.\"\nTop Democrats now have their eyes on former Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who lost last year's re-election bid in a onetime top swing state that's become reliably red over the past decade.\nWHAT A TOP POLITICAL HANDICAPPER SAID ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS' CHANCES TO WIN BACK SENATE IN 2026\nSchumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, trekked to Ohio this summer in hopes of convincing Brown to take on Republican Sen. Jon Husted, Fox News confirmed.\nBrown, who served over three decades in the House and later the Senate, is viewed by Democrats as the only candidate who could potentially topple Husted, who was named at the beginning of this year to fill the seat left vacant when then-Sen. JD Vance stepped down to become vice president.\nDemocrats landed the candidate they were hoping for in swing state New Hampshire in the race to succeed retiring longtime Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.\nFour-term Rep. Chris Pappas' announcement in early April that he would run to succeed Shaheen has cleared the Democratic primary field, as of now, of any potential rivals for the party's Senate nomination.\nMeanwhile, a Republican primary in the state \u2013 where the GOP hasn't won a Senate race in 15 years \u2013 is heating up between former Sen. Scott Brown and state Sen. Dan Innis, with the possibility of more candidates entering the race.\nIn battleground Georgia, which President Donald Trump narrowly carried in last year's White House race, Republicans view first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff as the most vulnerable Democrat incumbent up for re-election next year.\nBut Ossoff is off to a very hot fundraising start, and a GOP primary between Reps. Mike Collins and Buddy Carter, and former college and professional football coach Derek Dooley, is starting to turn combustible.\nOf potential concern for the Democrats is Michigan, where the dynamics appear to be the opposite of Georgia, in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Gary Peters.\nFormer Rep. Mike Rogers, the 2024 GOP Senate nominee who narrowly lost last year's race, appears to have cleared the Republican, thanks in great part to Trump's endorsement and likely arm twisting by the president's political team.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have a very competitive primary on their hands. The primary race includes three well-known Democrats: Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, and former gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed, who enjoys the backing of progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\nWhile Texas has long been a reliable red state, and conservative firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz comfortably won re-election last year, Democrats are optimistic about their 2026 chances to potentially flip a red seat to blue.\nThat's because longtime GOP Sen. John Cornyn is facing a serious primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a MAGA world rockstar.\nPaxton has long been surrounded by scandals, and is now dealing with a headline-grabbing divorce with his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxtom. And Democrats believe if Paxton topples Cornyn in next March's GOP primary, he'll be toxic in the general election.\nBut Democrats could have a competitive primary in Texas as well.\nFormer Rep. Colin Allred, who lost to Cruz last November, launched a second straight campaign earlier this year.\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who came close to ousting Cruz in the state's 20218 Senate election before unsuccessfully running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination and losing the 2022 Texas gubernatorial race to GOP Gov. Greg Abbott, is taking a hard look at a 2026 Senate run.\nState Rep. James Talarico, who grabbed national attention recently for his appearance with popular podcaster Joe Rogan, and Rep. Joaquin Castro, are also mulling bids.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDemocrats also feel they may have a shot in Iowa \u2013 a onetime swing state that's become firmly red in recent election cycles \u2013 if Republican Sen. Joni Ernst decides against seeking a third term in the Senate.\nBut they'll likely have a much better chance of flipping a GOP-held seat in blue state Maine if longtime Republican incumbent Sen. Susan Collins decides against seeking re-election."

      "text": "Republican Rep. Mike Collins on Monday announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in Georgia, in a crucial race for the GOP as the party aims to expand its Senate majority in next year's midterm elections.\nCollins is aiming to challenge Democrat Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is running for re-election in the key southeastern battleground state that President Donald Trump narrowly carried in last year's election. And Republicans view Ossoff as the most vulnerable Senate Democrat incumbent on the ballot in 2026.\n\"Jon Ossoff does not represent Georgia\u2019s values and has attacked our state's best interests at every opportunity. He\u2019s voted to raise taxes on Georgia families, supercharge inflation, open our Southern Border, and allow men to play women\u2019s sports,\" Collins argued in a statement as he launched his campaign.\nCollins highlighted that \"this is Georgia\u2019s moment. This is the people\u2019s time to take back control of this Senate seat, deliver on President Trump\u2019s America First agenda, and kick Jon Ossoff to the curb\u2014and together, that\u2019s exactly what we will do next November.\"\nFIRST ON FOX: TRUMP ALLY TO LAUNCH SENATE CAMPAIGN IN KEY BATTLEGROUND\nThe announcement by Collins came as no surprise. Fox News Digital learned on Friday that the congressman would launch his Senate campaign early this week.\nCollins, a businessman who founded a trucking company, is in his second term representing Georgia's 10th Congressional District, which includes a large swath of urban, suburban, and rural areas between Atlanta and Augusta.\nThe conservative lawmaker, who's the son of the late Republican Rep. Mac Collins of Georgia, has been moving closer to launching a Senate campaign for weeks.\nTRUMP TEAM \u2018PISSED OFF\u2019 WITH REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE SENATE NOMINATION RACE\n\"Tires kicked. Fueling up,\" Collis wrote Monday in a social media post that was accompanied by a video where he showcased his ties to President Donald Trump.\n\"Congressman Mike Collins, he loves this state,\" Trump said in a clip in the video.\nAnd Collins' launch video, which he posted on social media on Monday morning, also includes a clip of the president praising the congressman, as well as visuals of Collins and Trump standing together.\nDemocratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey took aim at Collins, charging he \"is a MAGA extremist who wants to raise the retirement age, voted against full Social Security benefits for first responders, propped up dangerous antisemetic rhetoric, and supports a federal abortion ban with no exceptions.\"\nBailey added in a statement that \"this already messy primary will expose just how out of step Collins is with Georgia voters as Republicans duke it out to prove who is more in line with Trump\u2019s toxic agenda, deep Medicaid cuts, and economic chaos.\"\nCollins was an early backer of the president, supporting him as Trump first ran for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 cycle.\nIn the 2024 presidential campaign, when Trump won back the White House, Collins traveled on behalf of Trump to the crucial early-voting primary and caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.\nHe also appeared at multiple Trump rallies during the 2024 cycle and opened three Trump campaign offices in Georgia.\nPOPULAR GOP GOVERNOR PASSES ON SENATE BID IN 2026\nAnd Collins, not facing a difficult re-election in his solidly red House seat, campaigned in ten congressional districts across the country to help elect Trump-aligned candidates as the GOP defended its razor-thin majority in the chamber.\nCollins at the beginning of this year reintroduced the Laken Riley Act, which mandates that undocumented immigrants charged with burglary or theft be detained. It's named after a Georgia nursing student killed by a man who had illegally entered the U.S. The case grabbed national attention.\nThe bill, which quickly passed the Republican-controlled House and Senate, became the first legislation signed into law by Trump as he started his second tour of duty in the White House.\nA Republican source said that Collins has a \"great relationship\" with the president and his political team.\nAnd a Georgia-based Republican consultant told Fox News that \"the lane that Mike is going to run in is the America First fighter who's been with President Trump.\"\nTrump, who is the ultimate kingmaker in GOP politics and whose endorsements in Republican primaries are extremely powerful, has yet to weigh in on whom he may back in Georgia's burgeoning Senate race.\nNational Republicans were hoping to recruit popular two-term GOP Gov. Brian Kemp to take on Ossoff. But Kemp, who is term-limited, announced earlier this year that he would pass on a 2026 Senate run.\nRepublican Rep. Buddy Carter, who for a decade has represented a district in coastal Georgia, launched a Senate campaign in the spring. Carter is also courting a Trump endorsement in the GOP primary.\nGeorgia Insurance Commissioner John King was also running for the Republican nomination, but ended his bid on Thursday.\nFormer University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley, who is the son of former longtime University of Georgia football coach Vince Dooley, is also considering a Senate bid. The younger Dooley is close with Kemp, who's a longtime friend.\nSources in Trump's political orbit and Republican sources in Georgia confirmed to Fox News on Friday that there was an agreement between the president\u2019s political operation and Kemp\u2019s political team that they would work together to find a candidate that they could all unify behind to take on Ossoff in the Senate race.\nThose sources also confirmed that Kemp and Trump met a couple of weeks ago to discuss the Senate race in Georgia.\nBut when the governor floated Dooley's name, a source close to the president's political team said \"they were told to stand down.\"\nAnd when Kemp and his team did move forward with Dooley, it upset Trump\u2019s advisers, who, according to sources, were \"already pretty annoyed\" that Kemp had passed earlier this year on taking on Ossoff in the Senate race.\n\"We had a deal to work together,\" a top political source in the Trump orbit told Fox News on Friday. \"Kemp went out on his own \u2013 which has frustrated and pissed off Trump orbit.\"\nBut a source close to the governor told Fox News that it's factually not true that they were told to stand down on Dooley.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAnd the source added that Kemp meant what he said that he wants to work with the president and his team and remains that way.\nA campaign announcement by Dooley could come as early as this week."
