  "content": "Oaktree Capital Management LP co-founder Howard Marks is sounding a cautionary note on today\u2019s market, drawing parallels to the late 1990s tech boom while offering investors a roadmap for navigating what he believes are the early stages of another bubble. Speaking on Bloomberg Television on Aug. 20, the legendary investor painted a picture of a market where stocks have become \u201cexpensive relative to fundamentals or reality,\u201d driven by psychological forces where investors increasingly \u201clike stocks too much.\u201d But unlike many market bears, Marks isn\u2019t hitting the panic button just yet.\n\u2022 Would You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early? The Same Backers Are Betting on This Vacation Home Platform\n\u2022 They Sold Their Last Real Estate Company for Nearly $1B \u2014 Now They're Building the Future of U.S. Industrial Growth \u201cWe\u2019re in the early days of a bubble,\u201d Marks explained, comparing the current environment to around 1997, when markets were \u201cfalling in love with tech stocks\u201d without concern for valuations\u2014a period that preceded former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan\u2019s famous \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d warning. However, Marks emphasized a crucial distinction: \u201cWe are currently in the early days and not yet at nutty valuation levels, so I\u2019m not ringing the alarm bells for an immediate correction.\u201d While Magnificent Seven tech giants like Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL, GOOG)) grab headlines with their outsized market gains and lofty valuations, Marks finds something more troubling lurking beneath the surface. \u201cWhat\u2019s more alarming is that high valuations are being applied to more average companies\u201d\u2014the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500\u2014\u201drather than just exceptional companies,\u201d Marks noted. While acknowledging the Magnificent Seven as \u201cgreat companies\u201d whose valuations he cannot definitively call \u201cexcessive,\u201d the broader market\u2019s embrace of rich multiples across ordinary businesses signals a more concerning shift in investor psychology. This widespread valuation expansion reflects what Marks identifies as the biggest mistake investors make, concluding that \u201cthe way things are today is the way it\u2019ll always be.\u201d This mindset, he argues, ignores the more probable \u201creversion to the mean\u201d and has been fostered by the absence of a serious market correction in 16 years.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace\u2014Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform Rather than advocating for a complete exit from risk assets, Marks suggests a more nuanced approach. \u201cIt\u2019s a time for some caution. Put a little more defense into your portfolio,\u201d said Marks. His preferred defensive strategy? A shift toward credit markets. \u201cInvesting in credit as opposed to equities is one way to achieve this,\u201d Marks explained, highlighting credit\u2019s inherent defensive characteristics compared to stocks. Credit offers what equities cannot: \u201ca promise of payment and a contractual rate of return,\" noted Marks. Even with tight credit spreads, Marks argues that \u201ca contractual guarantee approaching returns in the sixes over the next 10 years is more defensive than being in the stock market at these elevated valuations.\u201d The math is compelling from a risk-adjusted perspective. Credit has a \u201chigh probability of doing fine,\u201d while stocks at current valuations face a \u201creasonable probability of doing less than fine.\u201d See Also: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years \u2014 This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It America Still Leads, But the Gap Is Narrowing Despite his cautions, Marks remains fundamentally bullish on America\u2019s long-term prospects. He still considers the U.S. the \u201cbest place in the world to invest,\u201d citing the nation\u2019s \u201cspirit of innovation, free markets, rule of law, capital markets, growth, dynamism, and great companies.\u201d However, he acknowledges a subtle shift: the U.S. may be \u201ca little less best than we used to be.\u201d This creates opportunities for discerning investors willing to trade some quality for better prices, as they can find \u201cless good assets in other parts of the world at cheaper prices.\u201d Marks closed his analysis with a quote from philosopher John Stuart Mill that encapsulates his investment philosophy: \u201cHe who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.\u201d By understanding both bull and bear cases, investors can make more informed decisions about navigating these uncertain waters. For investors heeding Marks\u2019 advice, the message is clear: maintain exposure to quality assets while building defensive positions through credit investments\u2014a strategy designed to weather whatever storm may come while still participating in continued market growth.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nFirst-time real estate investors can face several hurdles when trying to get started: high upfront costs, dealing with tenants and maintenance, finding and closing on a suitable property, and the fear that your initial investment won\u2019t see a return, just to name a few.\nNow, there\u2019s a company that handles all the grunt work and provides a money-back guarantee on your initial investment.\nIntroducing mogul, the simplest way to own income-producing blue chip real estate.\nFounded by former Goldman Sachs executives who have closed more than $10 billion in deals, they handle the sourcing, underwriting, and day-to-day management of every property.\nTo remove first-time jitters, mogul gives new investors their First-$10k Protection Guarantee: If your initial investment of up to $10,000 loses value in the first year, mogul refunds every lost dollar.\nInvestors in mogul portfolios have earned an average annualized return of 18.8%, paid out as monthly rental income plus appreciation.\nStart building a diversified property portfolio in minutes while mogul absorbs the downside.\n\u2018If we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit\u2019\nAlex Blackwood and Joey Gumataotao, mogul\u2019s co-founders, routinely surpassed 15-20% annual returns when closing deals at Goldman Sachs. When they looked at other real estate investment platforms at the time, they found those companies would often brag to those investors about 4% annual returns on billions of dollars.\nAs Alex says on mogul\u2019s website, \u201cIf we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit immediately.\u201d\nTo date, properties in mogul\u2019s portfolio have generated an average 10-12% annual cash-on-cash yield that hit users\u2019 accounts as rent dividends each month. When long-term appreciation is included, historical performance rises to an 18.8% annualized returns, giving investors both regular income and capital growth\nPart of their success is due to the fact that mogul mogul approves fewer than one percent of properties reviewed. Each candidate asset must clear a 12% bear case hurdle rate before moving to the next level of diligence.\nYou can browse eligible properties on mogul\u2019s website and buy part or all of a house in under 30 seconds, or use the same data and tools available to top real estate firms to underwrite any property across the U.S.\nRent collections are aggregated and distributed to investors every month. At the same time, independent third-party valuations refresh inside your dashboard, letting you watch equity climb in real time while still enjoying depreciation and other pass-through tax advantages unique to real estate.\nMore than $1.2 million was invested on mogul last month.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

The Same Backers Are Betting on This Vacation Home Platform\n- They Sold Their Last Real Estate Company for Nearly $1B \u2014 Now They're Building the Future of U.S. Industrial Growth\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the early days of a bubble,\u201d Marks explained, comparing the current environment to around 1997, when markets were \u201cfalling in love with tech stocks\u201d without concern for valuations\u2014a period that preceded former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan\u2019s famous \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d warning. However, Marks emphasized a crucial distinction: \u201cWe are currently in the early days and not yet at nutty valuation levels, so I\u2019m not ringing the alarm bells for an immediate correction.\u201d\nThe Real Concern Isn\u2019t Just Big Tech\nWhile Magnificent Seven tech giants like Amazon Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG)) grab headlines with their outsized market gains and lofty valuations, Marks finds something more troubling lurking beneath the surface.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more alarming is that high valuations are being applied to more average companies\u201d\u2014the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500\u2014\u201drather than just exceptional companies,\u201d Marks noted. While acknowledging the Magnificent Seven as \u201cgreat companies\u201d whose valuations he cannot definitively call \u201cexcessive,\u201d the broader market\u2019s embrace of rich multiples across ordinary businesses signals a more concerning shift in investor psychology.\nThis widespread valuation expansion reflects what Marks identifies as the biggest mistake investors make, concluding that \u201cthe way things are today is the way it\u2019ll always be.\u201d This mindset, he argues, ignores the more probable \u201creversion to the mean\u201d and has been fostered by the absence of a serious market correction in 16 years.\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace\u2014Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nA Strategic Shift Toward Credit\nRather than advocating for a complete exit from risk assets, Marks suggests a more nuanced approach. \u201cIt\u2019s a time for some caution. Put a little more defense into your portfolio,\u201d said Marks.\nHis preferred defensive strategy? A shift toward credit markets. \u201cInvesting in credit as opposed to equities is one way to achieve this,\u201d Marks explained, highlighting credit\u2019s inherent defensive characteristics compared to stocks.\nCredit offers what equities cannot: \u201ca promise of payment and a contractual rate of return,\" noted Marks. Even with tight credit spreads, Marks argues that \u201ca contractual guarantee approaching returns in the sixes over the next 10 years is more defensive than being in the stock market at these elevated valuations.\u201d\nThe math is compelling from a risk-adjusted perspective. Credit has a \u201chigh probability of doing fine,\u201d while stocks at current valuations face a \u201creasonable probability of doing less than fine.\u201d\nSee Also: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years \u2014 This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\nAmerica Still Leads, But the Gap Is Narrowing\nDespite his cautions, Marks remains fundamentally bullish on America\u2019s long-term prospects. He still considers the U.S. the \u201cbest place in the world to invest,\u201d citing the nation\u2019s \u201cspirit of innovation, free markets, rule of law, capital markets, growth, dynamism, and great companies.\u201d\nHowever, he acknowledges a subtle shift: the U.S. may be \u201ca little less best than we used to be.\u201d This creates opportunities for discerning investors willing to trade some quality for better prices, as they can find \u201cless good assets in other parts of the world at cheaper prices.\u201d\nMarks closed his analysis with a quote from philosopher John Stuart Mill that encapsulates his investment philosophy: \u201cHe who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.\u201d By understanding both bull and bear cases, investors can make more informed decisions about navigating these uncertain waters.\nFor investors heeding Marks\u2019 advice, the message is clear: maintain exposure to quality assets while building defensive positions through credit investments\u2014a strategy designed to weather whatever storm may come while still participating in continued market growth.\nRead Next: From Chipotle to Red Bull, Top Brands Are Already Building With Modern Mill's Tree-Free Wood Alternative \u2014 Here's How You Can Invest Too\nImage: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.Own Shares in the Future of Wood\u2122. See How Modern Mill is Building For the Next Generation.\nYour parents built with wood. Your grandparents built with wood. But what if there's something better for the next generation?\nHere\u2019s the reality: Harvesting 200 year old-growth trees that take centuries to mature is wasteful, costly, and increasingly impractical. With new tariffs, environmental regulation and global supply disruptions, wood has seemingly never been more difficult to source.\nModern Mill has changed that. From their hometown in Mississippi, the next-generation manufacturer has engineered ACRE, a 100% tree-free composite made from upcycled rice hulls. ACRE mirrors the beauty of tropical hardwoods like ipe, walnut, mahogany, and teak, without the environmental toll or premium price of cutting down old-growth forests.\nNow you can own shares in the company that aims to redefine the future of building, one tree-free board at a time.\nWood for the Next Generation\u2122\nFor centuries, wood has been the go-to material for building, but it comes with problems: constant upkeep, poor durability in tough climates, and the environmental toll of cutting down old-growth trees.\nTraditional composites were the next attempt at a solution. While they delivered durability, they were difficult to work with and couldn\u2019t simulate the authentic look and feel of real wood.\nModern Mill believes ACRE changes that. It\u2019s the first material to combine the warmth and workability of wood with the low-maintenance durability of composites. Builders, architects, and homeowners are switching to ACRE for siding, decking, trim, fencing, cabinetry, and more.\nMade in Mississippi, Modern Mill is bringing manufacturing back to the USA, creating quality jobs and revolutionizing the way the world builds. ACRE is made with a zero-waste process that transforms landfill-bound rice hulls into a high-performance wood alternative.\nModern Mill has already proven impact, generating over $20M of revenue in 2024 and more than $84M raised in private funding. Now the company is inviting investors to join their mission to bring a new standard of building materials to a $500B market opportunity for siding, trim, decking, millwork, and more.\n*HISTORICAL GROWTH & PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.\nThe big names are already on board. ACRE was chosen by major brands like Red Bull, Heineken, Chipotle, and OMNI Hotels for high-profile projects, and it\u2019s quickly becoming a go-to choice for consumers who want a durable and sustainable alternative to wood.\nWith national distribution in place, Modern Mill reaches the market through established two-step distributors, dealers, and lumber yards, supported by sales and marketing programs that drive product demand from the ground up.\nThe company\u2019s vision and innovation have also earned recognition from PBS\u2019 This Old House, Forbes, and Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies List.\nDisclaimers\nThis Reg CF offering is made available through StartEngine Primary, LLC.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A. A copy of the Final Offering Circular that forms a part of the Offering Statement may be obtained from: invest.pacaso.com.
