  "content": "ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Ketel Marte\u2019s solo home run to deep left field with two out in the ninth inning gave the Arizona Diamondbacks a 3-2 win over the Texas Rangers on Tuesday night.\n\nMarte\u2019s homer off Danny Coulombe (2-1) followed consecutive strikeouts of Jose Herrera and Geraldo Perdomo. Perdomo\u2019s was the fifth looking for Arizona among 11 strikeouts, after which manager Torey Lovullo protested and was ejected by home plate umpire Nate Tomlinson.\n\nJalen Beeks (3-1) pitched 1 2/3 hitless innings followed in the ninth by rookie Juan Morillo, who earned his first big-league save.\n\nMarte also drove in the seventh-inning run that tied the score 2-2 following two Rangers infield errors.\n\nThe Diamondbacks, 6 1/2 games out of the NL wild-card race, have won four of their last five games.\n\nArizona\u2019s five most recent saves starting July 20 have come from five different pitchers.\n\nThe Rangers, who won Monday night\u2019s series opener, are 6 1/2 games out of first place in the AL West and 3 1/2 games out of the league\u2019s last wild-card spot.\n\nThe Rangers, held to four hits, led 2-1 after three innings on sacrifice flies by Adolis Garc\u00eda and Marcus Semien.\n\nTexas starter Jack Leiter allowed four hits in five innings, one of them being Blaze Alexander\u2019s solo home run in the third.\n\nDiamondbacks starter Anthony DeSclafani allowed both runs in three innings in his fourth start of the season in 11 appearances after being signed in mid-June.\n\nArizona\u2019s seventh inning, aided by Texas pitcher Robert Garcia\u2019s throwing error and third baseman Josh Jung\u2019s fielding error.\n\nThe Rangers were 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position and left seven runners on base.\n\nWednesday afternoon\u2019s series finale will match Rangers RHP Merrill Kelly (9-7, 3.38 ERA), who was acquired from Arizona on July 31, against Diamondbacks RHP Zac Gallen (9-12, 5.31).",

The Astros lost 14-1 to Boston, dropping into a first-place tie with Seattle.\nSeattle is starting a road trip that also includes matchups with the Mets and Phillies. The Mariners have three more games against Houston in mid-September, and those will decide who wins the season series.\nKirby allowed three hits in seven innings on an 87-degree night that wasn\u2019t oppressive, but seemed to give closer Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz trouble when he began to feel lightheaded while pitching the ninth. The heat also altered Kirby\u2019s wardrobe.\n\u201cFirst time I haven\u2019t worn sleeves in probably two years, which was nice,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cI was just finding a way to cool down in the tunnel \u2014 some ice or whatever it is. It\u2019ll get you, so you just got to make sure you hydrate.\u201d\nSince allowing 11 runs in 8 2/3 innings in his first two starts of the season, Kirby has shaved his ERA all the way down to 3.71. It\u2019s the first time all year that he has finished a game with it under 4.00.\nIn the ninth, Mu\u00f1oz needed a lengthy break on the mound after walking Gunnar Henderson. After taking a drink out of a cup, he allowed a single to Adley Rutschman and a long foul fly to Ryan Mountcastle that was almost a home run.\nThen Mountcastle grounded out to end it.\n\u201cI thought he battled through it very well and made some good pitches there to Mountcastle, who put up a pretty good at-bat,\u201d manager Dan Wilson said. \u201cThat was a big save right there in a big situation.\u201d\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb"

He got a standing ovation from the 21,874 fans.\n\u201cIt felt good. Obviously it\u2019s not easy to play the game and it\u2019s not an easy thing to do,\u201d he said through an interpreter. \u201cBut the important part is that we won and most importantly, I want to win. So that\u2019s the real feeling at the end.\u201d\nAfter a 10-game losing streak had them at 40-48, the Guardians have gone an AL-best 22-8 since July 7 and are only one game out of the final wild-card spot.\n\u201cIt always feels like he\u2019s going to deliver. Anytime he\u2019s up at any point in the game, you make sure you\u2019re watching,\u201d Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said. \u201cSuch a special night for him and his family.\u201d\nRam\u00edrez\u2019s 27 multihomer games since entering the majors on Sept. 1, 2013, are tied for eighth-most in the majors according to Sportradar. Yankees\u2019 slugger Aaron Judge, who made his big-league debut in 2016, has the most with 44.\n\u201cHe\u2019s our dad taking care of us. He\u2019s putting his team on the back doing what he does,\u201d All-Star left fielder Steven Kwan said. \u201cI mean, people don\u2019t have 54 homers in their whole career and he is doing it and obviously 27 games, which is just crazy. It\u2019s special.\u201d\nRam\u00edrez was 2 for 25 on the Guardians\u2019 six-game road trip and broke out of a 0-for-12 skid when he drove a low changeup from Miami starter Janson Junk into the stands in right-center to put Cleveland up 1-0 in the first inning.\nOf his 25 homers this season, 13 have come with two out, which is third in the majors.\nOn Aug. 1, Ram\u00edrez became the first major league player who primarily plays third base to have at least 275 home runs and 275 stolen bases. Besides multihomer games, he holds the Cleveland franchise records for career home runs by a third baseman (230) and career home runs by a switch hitter.\n\u201cI knew maybe I don\u2019t have the power, but I have quick hands and fast hands when hitting. So I knew I had to learn how to hit homers. I knew I could. I just needed time to learn how to execute it,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said about growing up.\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb"
