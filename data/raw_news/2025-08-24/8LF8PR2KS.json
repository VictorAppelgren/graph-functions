  "title": "No evidence of shootings at Villanova, University of South Carolina, school officials say",
  "description": "The two incidents occurred just days after there were shooting scares at both Villanova and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga on Aug. 21.",
  "content": "Unconfirmed reports of an active shooter at the University of South Carolina and a second false report at Villanova University briefly caused panic on Aug. 24 as law enforcement searched through the two campuses before issuing an all-clear.\n\nStudents at the University of South Carolina, a public university located in the state's capital city of Columbia, were told to shelter in place shortly after 6:30 p.m. local time after an active shooter was reported near the school's library. A campus alert later stated that there was no evidence of a shooter as police continued to investigate, and an all-clear was issued.\n\n\"There is no ongoing emergency at this time; you no longer need to shelter in place,\" according to a campus alert sent at around 8:11 p.m. local time. \"The Thomas Cooper Library building remains closed until further notice.\"\n\nAbout seven hours earlier, Villanova University, a private Catholic research university in suburban Philadelphia, was targeted in a second hoax report of an active shooter that was directed at a student dormitory, according to the Radnor Township Police Department. Police said in a social media post that they were working to clear the campus and restore normal operations after determining that the report was false.\n\nThe two incidents occurred just days after there were shooting scares at both Villanova and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga on Aug. 21. School and local officials had called the false active shooter reports at Villanova a \"cruel hoax,\" while an all-clear was issued for the University of Tennessee shortly after the initial report.\n\nInstances of swatting have been plaguing the nation for years, with fake shooting threats frightening the public and forcing schools, hospitals, grocery stores, office buildings, and airports into temporary lockdowns. These false reports are intended to draw a heavy law enforcement response to a hoax victim.\n\nEstimated swatting incidents jumped from 400 in 2011 to more than 1,000 in 2019, according to the Anti-Defamation League. From January 2023 to June 2024, more than 800 incidents of swatting were recorded at elementary, middle, and high schools across the country, according to the K-12 School Shootings Database, created by a University of Central Florida doctoral student in response to the Parkland High School shooting in 2018.\n\nJeff Stensland, a spokesperson for the University of South Carolina, told USA TODAY that campus police had received a report of gunfire at the Thomas Cooper Library on the main Columbia campus at around 6:30 p.m. local time.\n\nA public safety alert was then sent to the campus community, warning people to avoid the area and shelter in place, according to Stensland. An initial alert from the campus described a potential suspect as a white man, about 6 feet tall, and wearing black pants.\n\nThe university later said police were searching affected buildings, and that emergency medical services treated \"a couple of students with minor injuries that occurred during evacuation.\" Stensland said law enforcement had immediately responded to the scene and found no evidence that a shooting had occurred.\n\n\"Videos circulating on social media purporting to show a suspect carrying a firearm are false,\" Stensland said. \"There have been false gunfire reports at universities across the country in recent days and tonight\u2019s incident remains under investigation.\"\n\nThe campus is now under normal operations and the library will reopen at 7:30 a.m. local time on Aug. 25, according to Stensland.\n\nSecond false report of an active shooter at Villanova University\n\nStudents were evacuated from Austin Hall, a student dormitory at Villanova, earlier on Aug. 24 after authorities were notified of a potential active shooter in the area, according to the Radnor Township Police Department. Police said the call was later confirmed to be false, and an investigation into the incident remains ongoing.\n\nFollowing the incident, the school's president, Rev. Peter M. Donohue, said in a letter to the campus community that students had received \"another flurry of Nova Alerts about another possible incident on campus.\" Donohue sought to assuage fears, noting that the campus was safe and there was \"no evidence of a legitimate threat to our community.\"\n\nHe added that there will be an increased police and public safety presence out of an abundance of caution on Aug. 24 and \"for the immediate future.\" Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies were also continuing to investigate the Aug. 21 and Aug. 24 incidents, according to Donohue.\n\n\"The call we received today about a possible threat was also unfounded,\" Donohue wrote in the letter. \"That said, I understand how alarming it is to receive these alerts, but we take every call seriously and take the utmost precaution to ensure the safety of our community. We will always be overly cautious and vigilant when it comes to campus safety.\"\n\nOn Aug. 21, authorities received a 911 call at around 4:30 p.m. local time reporting that there was an active shooter in a Villanova law school building and at least one victim was wounded. Shortly after, a campus alert was issued warning students: \"ACTIVE SHOOTER on VU campus. Move to secure location. Lock/barricade doors.\"\n\nThe incident, later deemed a hoax, prompted a massive police response as students and families scrambled to find shelter on the first day of orientation. State and local authorities have since vowed to hold the suspected hoax caller accountable.",

      "text": "Schools across US hit with dozens of false shooting, bomb threats. Experts say it's a 'cruel hoax'\nAcross the country, dozens of schools went on lockdown. Students and teachers hid in classrooms. Police searched campuses. Parents panicked.\nEach time, there was no threat. Officials say there's been a wave of false reports of school shootings and threats of violence over the last several days. USA TODAY found at least 30 active shooter false alarms and threats made at schools last week.\nAuthorities haven't publicly said the incidents are related, but experts say these intentional false reports have similarities. Their origins can be difficult or impossible to trace, but waves of false alarms are often the work of disgruntled pranksters trying to disrupt school or malicious bad actors trying to sow fear. And such hoaxes seem to increase around this time of year with students returning to classrooms.\n\"A red flag... is when you start seeing a chunk of these very similar threats in multiple cities in one area or region or state, and then others in another state. It's usually a red flag for what they call swatting,\" said Kenneth Trump, a school safety expert.\n\"Swatting\" is making a hoax call to law enforcement to deliberately cause a large police or SWAT team response. Sometimes, an individual does it to single out someone specific, but the calls can also be done in waves as a trend to seemingly random targets.\nMORE ON SHOOTINGS: Mass killings database reveals trends, details and anguish in every US event since 2006\nINCREASED VIOLENCE: Shots fired in US schools spiked dramatically last year, gun violence report finds\nFalse school shooting reports in Florida, California and more\nIn Texas on Tuesday, Houston authorities received a call that said two shooters were rampaging Heights High School and 10 students had been shot. Police did a room-by-room search of the school. They found no trace of a shooting.\nSimilar false reports happened at several other schools in Texas and California that day.\nOn Wednesday, threats made on social media temporarily shuttered schools in the Thorndale Independent School District in central Texas, Eisenhower High School outside of Houston and a false shooting report put a Fresno, California high school on lockdown.\nThe same thing happened Thursday in Santa Barbara, California where another false shooting report was phoned in, and in Northampton, Massachusetts, where a school received a bomb threat on social media.\nFalse shooting reports were also called in about schools in Florida, Arkansas, Oregon, Illinois, Kansas and Oklahoma.\nFear among students, parents during hoaxes\nAmaris Sanchez, 17, was in English class at W.B. Ray High School in Corpus Christi, Texas, on Friday when the school went on lockdown after police got a call about an active shooter on campus. It turned out to be false.\n\u201cI was mentally preparing myself, you know, whatever happens,\u201d Sanchez told the Corpus Christi Caller Times, part of the USA TODAY Network. \u201cIt was a very scary moment because you don\u2019t know what was going to happen. I didn\u2019t know at the moment if I was going to be OK.\u201d\nBelen Alaniz, a parent of two children at South Fort Myers High School in Florida where a false shooting report was made Friday, told the Fort Myers News-Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, she left work immediately when she heard about a shooting on campus.\n\"The first thought was leaving work and I didn't care,\" Alaniz said. \"I told my manager, 'I'm leaving,' and I ran out the door. I didn't even clock out because that's how afraid I was.\"\nFBI probing possible connections in slew of threats\nLocal FBI field offices in a few states are working with police to determine whether there is a connection between some of the threats.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with local authorities and our field offices nationwide to determine if there is a link. Obviously, any hoax threat to a school can have serious consequences for students, teachers and others, as well as first responders, and can be prosecuted as a crime,\" said Laura Eimiller, a spokesperson for the FBI's Los Angeles field office.\nHISTORIC HIGH: It's not just Uvalde, Texas \u2014 gunfire on school grounds is at historic high in the US\nAFTER UVALDE: Texas school shooting report finds 'systemic failures' in law enforcement response\nIn the wake of the elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that killed 19 fourth-graders and their two teachers, schools and families across the country are on high alert and in a constant state of anxiety over school safety, Trump said. \"People are on edge,\" he said.\nMany of the recent false alarms have fallen into two categories, said Trump, who said he has no relation to the former president and heads the Cleveland-based National School Safety and Security Services.\nIn some cases, threats are made by members of the local community, oftentimes teenagers or young adults who are disgruntled with the school or who might be trying to pull a prank or get out of a test.\n\"They're not realizing that once you press send, you can't put the threat back into the smartphone,\" Trump said. \"And then when the ton of bricks hits, as happens in many other teen bad decisions, in this case, you're getting significant consequences.\"\nThose consequences can include suspension, expulsion, criminal prosecution and serious fines. Just last week, authorities say teens were charged in Michigan and Florida for making school shooting threats.\nThe other category of swatting threats comes from malicious outside parties that often have no connection to the schools or the local communities. They can be generated from anywhere in the country or even internationally.\n\"The FBI is aware of the numerous swatting incidents wherein a report of an active shooter at a school is made. The FBI takes swatting very seriously because it puts innocent people at risk,\" the FBI said in a statement to USA TODAY.\nHoax threats drain resources, traumatize students and staff\nThe false reports of active shootings can traumatize students and staff. They also drain significant resources from schools and local authorities.\n\"Non-credible school hoaxes are a serious offense that Los Angeles Unified takes seriously. Threats disrupt the educational environment, increase stress levels, and interfere with law enforcement's ability to protect schools from real dangers. It also poses a serious risk to our community, draining resources and occupying the time of critical first responders,\" the Los Angeles Unified School District said in a statement after a hoax report of shots fired at Hollywood High School last week.\nThe swatting threats can also pose a serious risk of injury. In 2017, California resident Tyler Barriss made a swatting call reporting a fake hostage situation after arguing with a fellow gamer playing \"Call of Duty.\" He gave an address of an innocent, unrelated person who police ended up fatally shooting during their response. Barriss was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\nAn uptick in these types of calls isn't unusual this time of year, Trump said. There's also a spike in the spring, and a wave of copycat threats in the wake of any mass school shooting. But the last several days have seen a higher number of incidents.\n\"I don't like to use the word prank,\" Trump said. \"It's not really a prank that we're seeing, it's really a cruel hoax.\""

      "text": "Lockdown lifted for University of Tennessee's campus in Chattanooga\nAn all clear has been issued for the University of Tennessee's campus in Chattanooga after it went into lockdown following reports of a possible shooting, the university said on Aug. 21.\n\"The UTC campus is ALL CLEAR. The lockdown has been lifted,\" the university said. \"Law enforcement found no evidence of a threat.\"\nThe university said that all classes and activities have been canceled until Aug. 22 and that students and non-essential employees could leave for the day.\nEarlier, the university said it received reports of a \"possible active shooter in the University Center or Library.\"\nA report of a shooting came in about 1 p.m. ET, according to the Chattanooga Police Department, and local, state and federal agencies converged on the campus. Videos showed a heavy police presence as students and faculty members huddled in classrooms amid the lockdown.\nNo victims or shooter were found, police said about an hour later.\nThe Hamilton County Emergency Management Service said in a statement multiple law enforcement agencies had left campus following the all clear. The agency added that \"no suspect or victims found\" and units were returning to service.\nThe University of Tennessee at Chattanooga is a public university that was founded in 1886 and is part of the larger University of Tennessee system, which has campuses in Knoxville and Martin. The Chattanooga campus served nearly 12,000 students in the 2024 fall semester, according to the university.\nThis is a developing story that will be updated."

In most swatting scenarios, someone makes an elaborate report--shooting in progress with multiple people shot, bombs inside a venue, hostage situation--to dispatch the highest priority police response.\nIn 2015, police swatting during live streamed video game competitions got mainstream attention. The calls are usually placed through voice-over-internet phone services and with a VPN that renders them nearly impossible to trace.\nA further complication for schools is that anonymous reporting apps have been mandated in many states which gives students an easy way to make a false report without getting caught.\nThere is an established pattern and each instance that generates +100 officers responding to these hoaxes is perpetuating the cycle.\nWe don\u2019t have the power to stop someone in a foreign country from making 911 calls over the internet.

      "text": "Hoaxes and panic: 'Swatting' incident at Villanova is a national problem\n'Swatting' and hoaxes have risen dramatically since 2011, especially at the nation's schools.\nThe alert to students at Villanova University was terrifying: \"ACTIVE SHOOTER on VU campus. Move to secure location. Lock/barricade doors. More info to follow.\"\nVideo and photos posted to social media show the mass panic that ensued Thursday, Aug. 21, as students were preparing for the start of fall classes. Waves of students were running for their lives, some posted about how they had barricaded themselves wherever they were when the text came in, and others simply posted about how scared they were.\n\"Hi guys i\u2019m a freshman at villanova. active shooter alert during the middle of opening mass for students,\" a poster wrote on X. \"everyone is hiding. pleaee just keep me in your thoughts. i\u2019m very scared.\"\nIt was all a \"cruel hoax,\" the university announced about 90 minutes after the alert went out.\nAt many levels across America, such hoaxes have been plaguing the nation for years, including at schools, grocery stores, office buildings and airports \u2212 anywhere large groups of people gather. Also known as swatting, they're defined as false reports of serious crimes intended to spark a heavy law enforcement response.\n\"It's an enormous problem,\" said Elizabeth Jaffe, associate professor at Atlanta\u2019s John Marshall Law School whose focus is cyberbullying and social media. \"One incident is a major problem, so if we've got hundreds and thousands, it\u2019s an evolving epidemic.\"\nEstimated swatting incidents jumped from 400 in 2011 to more than 1,000 in 2019, according to the Anti-Defamation League, which cited a former FBI agent whose expertise is in swatting.\nFrom January 2023 to June 2024 alone, more than 800 instances of swatting were recorded at U.S. elementary, middle and high schools, according to the K-12 School Shootings Database, created by a University of Central Florida doctoral student in response to the Parkland High School shooting in 2018.\nThe FBI has been aware of the problem since at least 2008. It became so pervasive that in 2023, the FBI launched a database for law enforcement agencies to report swatting incidents, according to an FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division announcement.\nIn the wake of the panic at Villanova, USA TODAY is looking at just how common hoaxes that cause mass panic are, why they happen, what the repurcussions are and what can be done.\nWho is doing the swatting and why?\nSwatting emerged as a popular if potentially deadly hoax among gamers in the early 2000s, according to researchers at the Anti-Defamation League. Since then, it has become a tool used by everyone from pranksters to online extremists, according to Carla Hill, senior director of investigative research at the Anti-Defamation League.\n\"It used to be someone would pull the fire alarm because they didn't want to go to school. Now they swat the school,\" Hill said.\n\"They get a thrill out of it,\" Jaffe said.\nHill, who has also worked to track swatters, played an instrumental role in an FBI investigation into a ring of swatters targeting Jewish and minority institutions in 2023.\nHill said she got lucky in the case because the group was bragging about the exploits online. The group targeted at least 25 synagogues in 13 states, according to the FBI.\nBut unless a swatter uses their own phone or speaks about it publicly, the person can be difficult for law enforcement to track. \"There\u2019s so many ways you can do it without being traceable,\" Hill said.\nWhy is swatting such a big problem?\nHoaxes not only disrupt schools and businesses, but they also drain police, fire and EMS resources that race to the scene.\n\"We have to treat each one as real until we know it's a hoax,\" Kelly Smith, former assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Seattle office, said in an agency video about the problem. \"We direct law enforcement resources away from other active investigations, and that causes a significant strain on the resources of both our agency and our local police departments.\"\nDavid Riedman, a data scientist and creator of the K-12 School Shooting Database, estimates that in 2023, it cost $82,300,000 for police to respond to false threats.\nThere's also the human toll.\n\"It causes trauma for students, parents and communities,\" said John DeCarlo, a former police chief who has responded to hoaxes and who is now a professor at the University of New Haven\u2019s Henry C. Lee College of Criminal Justice and Forensic Sciences. \"While the call itself may be a lie, the panic and trauma it creates are very real.\"\nHoax calls also can land innocent bystanders in dangerous situations. Four Black undergraduate students at Harvard University wound up being held at gunpoint during a swatting incident at the Ivy League school in 2023, according to reporting by The Harvard Crimson.\nAnd some cases of swatting have turned deadly. Tyler Barriss, a gamer with a history of making hoax calls, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in connection with the shooting death of Andrew Finch in Wichita, Kansas, in 2017, according to reporting by NBC News. Finch was shot and killed by police responding to a swatting call Barriss made. Finch, who did not know Barriss, lived at an address where Barriss believed his target was.\nWhat can be done about swatting?\nExperts agree that stronger laws, harsher penalties and better technology to track swatters are needed.\n\"It\u2019s often like this with technology: We need to catch up,\" Hill said, adding there are stronger protections in some states. \"We need to get some laws on the books.\"\nDeCarlo said one major step was the FBI treating swatting as a federal offense but agreed that technology is a major hurdle because it can allow swatters to mask their voices, IP addresses and identities. He expects more swatting incidents similar to Villanova's as authorities scramble for solutions.\n\"The fact is every hoax call like this diverts officers from real emergencies and real risks, and that\u2019s the real tragedy of it,\" he said. \"It takes public protection away where it's needed.\"\nAmanda Lee Myers is a senior crime reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Shooting hoax at Villanova spread panic during orientation: 'Harder to leave our children'\nVILLANOVA, PA \u2014 Just days before the start of the academic year, a report of a shooting at Villanova University on Aug. 21 sent panic through the campus as frightened students and visitors scrambled to barricade themselves inside nearby buildings.\nThe report of an active shooter that forced the university into lockdown on the first day of orientation was deemed a \"cruel hoax,\" according to the school's president, Rev. Peter M. Donohue. A campus alert was sent around 4:30 p.m. local time during an orientation Mass welcoming new students, who had recently moved in on Aug. 20.\nThe school's alert urged students and visitors, including many families sending off their loved ones, to move to a secure location and lock or barricade doors. Authorities later began clearing the scene after confirming there was no evidence of an active shooter incident or victims.\n\"Today, as we were celebrating orientation mass to welcome our newest Villanovians and their families to our community, panic and terror ensued with the news of a possible shooter at the law school,\" Donohue said in a statement.\nFirst-year students and their families filed back to Corr Hall Chapel for an evening blessing by Donohue, who wanted to calm and unite the crowd after the incident had shocked families and students on campus.\nDonohue and many others were attending the opening Mass when they got a call or text about an active shooter on campus. He said he went inside the church, and everyone in the seats scattered.\"They walked up to me and said, 'You need to get out of here now,'\" Donohue said. \"We weren\u2019t at the second reading yet.\"\n'Makes it harder to leave our children'\nRandall Carter and Charlie Schwartz, both freshmen from California, said they ran off into nearby buildings that were open and rushed into classrooms.\nSchwartz and his mother, Dana Nachman, both from Los Altos, California, ran into an empty classroom in a university engineering building. They even barricaded the door.\n\"It was extremely stressful and makes it harder to leave our children,\" she said.\nAnother parent of a first-year student, Joe DiRienzo, of Harding, New Jersey, said the situation was managed well by staff.\nSunglasses and water bottles were strung out around campus during the chaos, leaving a crowded, makeshift lost and found table. Though everyone was thankful the shooting was a hoax, the experience left an uneasy feeling around the campus of the Catholic university in suburban Philadelphia.\nMany continued to gather and pray afterwards. Donohue led the campus in the Lord's Prayer and dismissed the crowd to be with their loved ones after the blessing. He called it an \"upheaval\" of what is usually a \"beautiful celebration.\"\"I said to somebody a little earlier, we will remember this at your graduation,\" he said."

      "text": "'Cruel hoax' report about active shooter put Villanova University on lockdown: Updates\nVILLANOVA, PA \u2014 A \"cruel hoax\" at Villanova University on Thursday afternoon sparked panic among students during the first day of orientation after false reports of an active shooter led to a temporary lockdown and prompted a massive police response, the school's president said.\nAuthorities received a 911 call at around 4:30 p.m. local time reporting that there was an active shooter in a Villanova law school building and at least one victim was wounded. Shortly after, a campus alert was issued warning students: \"ACTIVE SHOOTER on VU campus. Move to secure location. Lock/barricade doors.\"\nLaw enforcement agencies immediately converged on the university as students and visitors, including many families who were helping their loved ones settle in, scattered across the campus to barricade in nearby buildings and classrooms. The lockdown lasted for about an hour before investigators deemed the incident a hoax.\nThe Radnor Township Police Department said in a social media post that there were no injuries and that federal and state officials are investigating the incident.\nThe incident occurred on the first day of new student orientation, according to a university academic calendar. The school's president, Rev. Peter M. Donohue, said officials received news of the possible shooter as the university was welcoming students and their families during an orientation Mass.\n\"Today, as we are celebrating Orientation Mass to welcome our newest Villanovans and their families to our community, panic and terror ensued,\" Donohue said in a statement. \"Mercifully, no one was injured and we now know it was a cruel hoax.\"\nThe apparent hoax came just hours after another active shooter was reported on the University of Tennessee's campus in Chattanooga. An all-clear was issued for that campus shortly after the initial report.\nVillanova University is a private Catholic research university located in the Philadelphia suburbs.\nVillanova University forced into lockdown as police searched campus\nFollowing the first campus alert, the university said at 4:53 p.m. local time that police were on the scene investigating. The university urged students and visitors to stay clear of the law school's Scarpa Hall and to continue sheltering in place.\nIn a later update, the Radnor Township Police Department said it was clearing buildings in the area.\n\"Radnor Township Police Department and assisting units are continuing to clear buildings at Villanova University. The incident remains ACTIVE. At this time, there are NO reported victims,\" the police department said in a statement on social media.\nAt around 6 p.m., the university said the campus was all clear and that people no longer needed to shelter in place. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro confirmed that the reports of an active shooter on campus were \"unfounded.\"\n\"The reports of an active shooter at Villanova today are unfounded, and products of a cruel swatting incident \u2014 when someone calls in a fake threat to induce panic,\" Shapiro said in a post on X.\nOrientation activities canceled for rest of the day\nIn another update at about 6:50 p.m., the university said it was still holding a blessing for the community at 7 p.m., but other orientation activities were canceled for the remainder of the evening. The school added that activities will resume on Friday.\nDonohue also provided an update following the incident. In a video, he told the campus community that they were safe and apologized for the incident.\n\"I would like to apologize to our first-year students and their families. This is not the introduction to Villanova that I had hoped for you. And while I cannot do anything to relieve the unrest that you are feeling right now, I can offer a prayer,\" Donohue said in the video's description.\nOfficials vow to hold suspect hoax caller accountable\nDuring a news conference on Thursday, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said the incident appeared to be caused by a hoax caller.\n\"We're all going to work to try to get to the bottom of who might have done this. Because if this was indeed a cruel hoax. This is a crime, and we will track you down if it's the last thing we do,\" Stollsteimer said.\nThe district attorney noted that there were thousands of people at the campus on Thursday, who were there to celebrate a \"joyous occasion\" that was \"ruined by somebody.\"\nAfter the incident was confirmed as a hoax, Shapiro said in a post on X that he has directed state police to \"work alongside their partners and use every tool at our disposal to find the person or people who called in this fake threat and hold them accountable.\"\n\"I know today was every parent's nightmare, and every student's biggest fear. I'm profoundly grateful no one was hurt, and thankful to all members of law enforcement who ran towards reports of danger to keep Pennsylvanians safe,\" the governor added.\n'Makes it harder to leave our children'\nSunglasses and water bottles were strung out around campus during the chaos, leaving a crowded makeshift lost and found table. Though everyone was thankful the shooting was a hoax, the experience left an uneasy feeling around the campus of the Catholic university.\nDonohue and many others were attending the opening Mass when they got a call or text about an active shooter on campus. He said he went inside the church, and everyone in the seats scattered.\nRandall Carter and Charlie Schwartz, both freshmen from California, said they ran off into nearby buildings that were open and rushed into classrooms.\nSchwartz and his mother, Dana Nachman, both from Los Altos, California, ran into an empty classroom in a university engineering building. They even barricaded the door.\n\"It was extremely stressful and makes it harder to leave our children,\" she said.\nWhat is swatting?\nThe FBI describes \"swatting\" as a prank designed to draw an emergency law enforcement response to a hoax victim, often creating a situation where a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team arrives ready for a possible violent encounter.\n\"The individuals who engage in this activity use technology to make it appear that the emergency call is coming from the victim\u2019s phone,\" said one FBI public announcement in 2013, titled \"The Crime of 'Swatting': Fake 9-1-1 Calls Have Real Consequences \u2014 FBI.\"\n\"Sometimes swatting is done for revenge, sometimes as a prank. Either way, it is a serious crime, and one that has potentially dangerous consequences.\u201d\nThe FBI first warned about the phone hacking phenomenon in 2008 and has arrested hundreds of people over the years on federal charges stemming from swatting incidents.\nContributing: Jonathan Limehouse and Josh Meyer, USA TODAY; Bucks County Courier Times"
