It is a packaging shift that can lift price, seats, and margins without\n\nMoretus Research delivers state-of-the-art, buy-side quality equity research for serious investors seeking clarity, conviction, and alpha. We focus on going beyond the obvious. We practice positive paranoia when analyzing investments \u2014 understanding sentiment, knowing where our competition is right or wrong, and how that will shape the future of any given security we\u2019re researching. We won\u2019t always be right, but we\u2019re right more often than we\u2019re wrong. More importantly, when we are right, we\u2019re right big. At the beginning of 2023, Oskar Goyvaerts, our CIO, recommended and bought Carvana at $5 per share for our readers \u2014 pointing out that the 88% short interest was wildly overblown and that alternative data signaled a looming turnaround. That idea returned more than 60x over three years. Finding another Carvana is unlikely, but we\u2019re confident in our ability to cut through the noise, focus on fundamentals, and uncover a data edge through carefully curated alternative data sources. We cover everything from businesses we own to companies we follow closely because we may want to own them in the future.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s Disclosure:I/we have no stock, option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned, but may initiate a beneficial Short position through short-selling of the stock, or purchase of put options or similar derivatives in ADBE over the next 72 hours.
