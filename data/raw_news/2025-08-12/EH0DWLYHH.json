  "content": "Saints center Will Clapp\u2019s season is over before it even started.\n\nThe Saints put Clapp, 29, on injured reserve Tuesday afternoon, with what NFL Network reported is a Lisfranc injury that occurred during the team\u2019s preseason opener on Sunday when he was carted off the field.\n\nThe move ended his year before he could suit up in the regular season and prevented what would have been a feel-good story for the franchise, with Clapp being a New Orleans native, an LSU alum and a seventh-round pick by the Saints in 2018.\n\nPlayers who are placed on IR during the preseason are not eligible to return.\n\nClapp spent his first four seasons in the NFL with the Saints, appearing in 34 games \u2014 seven of which were starts \u2014 during that span.\n\nHe spent two seasons with the Chargers and was a member of the Bills in 2024 before re-signing with New Orleans in March.\n\n\u201cI remember I was just chilling at the house one day, playing on the ground with my son, and my agent called me. The Saints were talking about getting a contract done, and I was just so excited,\u201d Clapp said in a video posted by the Saints back in March. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it was probably going to come together, and from that moment on, I was just pretty focused. I was like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s just get this done. I don\u2019t want to entertain anything else right now.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith starting center Erik McCoy dealing with injuries, Torricelli Simpkins will likely be the next man up at the position.",

      "text": "CBS reporter Amanda Balionis enjoyed some R&R in Ibiza before she hits the sidelines for the 2025 NFL season.\nTaking to Instagram, Balionis shared a carousel of snapshots from the trip she took with her grade school friends and their partners.\n\u201cHey Ibiza.. It was really nice to meet ya \ud83e\udd1d Never take for granted that many of my best friends are the ones I met in elementary school,\u201d Balionis, 39, captioned the Saturday post. \u201cTo take this trip with them\u2026 well I think 5th grade us would be really proud of how far we\u2019ve come, and that we continue to choose to do it together \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f also shoutout to the guys for marrying the most fun partners \ud83e\udee1.\u201d\nBalionis looked stunning in a white bikini as she enjoyed a coconut cocktail under the sun.\nOther images spotlighted group dinners, sightseeing and partying in fluorescent-lit clubs.\nBalionis took some well-deserved time off after 19 weeks on the road with \u201cGolf on CBS.\u201d\nLast week, she shared a tribute to her broadcast team, including photos from the season.\n\u201cHard to put into words what 19 weeks on the road really looks like,\u201d Balionis wrote. \u201cFor us announcers, we have it easy \u2014 we show up to work with hotel rooms already booked, everything we need waiting at check-in. Our headsets and mics work flawlessly, our sets are stocked, and our camera operators have been setting the scene for days.\u201d\nBalionis made headlines off the course last May when a Daily Mail report linked her and McIlroy after he filed for divorce from his wife of seven years, Erica Stoll.\nMcIlroy, 36, and Stoll have since reunited, and his divorce petition was voluntarily dismissed.\nFans noticed Balionis wasn\u2019t wearing her wedding ring last February while covering the Genesis Invitational.\nBalionis married former North Carolina quarterback Bryn Renner, who also had a brief career in the NFL, in 2022.\nBalionis, who wasn\u2019t wearing her ring in the Ibiza photos, has not publicly addressed speculation about a divorce, but Renner no longer appears on her social media pages.\nUs Weekly confirmed last spring that Balinois and the reigning Masters champ \u201care not dating and only have a professional relationship.\u201d\nBalionis joined CBS Sports in 2017 as a golf reporter and also serves as a sideline reporter for select NFL ON CBS games and CBS Sports Network college football games."
