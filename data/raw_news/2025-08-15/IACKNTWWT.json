  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department worker accused of throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent was re-arrested by an armed team of at least a half-dozen US Marshals in a dramatic Wednesday night raid, new video shows.\n\nSean Charles Dunn, 37, was cuffed a second time inside his apartment about a mile northwest of the White House \u2014 after being slapped with a felony assault charge.\n\nFootage of the raid was posted by the White House on X Thursday evening with the caption: \u201cNighttime Routine: Operation Make D.C. Safe Again Edition.\u201d\n\nIn a stunning twist, Attorney General Pam Bondi had revealed hours earlier that Dunn was a DOJ Criminal Division employee.\n\nIn the same statement, Bondi announced Dunn was fired from his post as an international affairs specialist working to help extradite criminal suspects to and from the US.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\u201d the AG said. \u201cYou will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thought it was funny,\u201d DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Wednesday in announcing the federal case. Well he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny today because we charged him with a felony: Assault on a police officer \u2026 So there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else!\u201d\n\nDunn initially was arrested Sunday night after allegedly berating a group of Customs and Border Protection officers as \u201cfascists\u201d before pelting one with his late-night snack \u2014 in what observers said appeared to be an alcohol-fueled rage.\n\nTrump announced a surge of federal officials to help DC police fight violent crime Aug. 7 and escalated the effort Monday by asserting federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department and mobilizing the National Guard.\n\nDunn wielded his deli weapon at the intersection of DC\u2019s 14th and U Streets \u2014 across from a McDonald\u2019s where a 16-year-old girl was stabbed to death in 2023 in a dispute over sweet and sour sauce.\n\nJust a couple blocks north of the site, a crowd of hecklers appeared to prompt federal agents to discontinue a vehicle checkpoint on Wednesday night.",

      "text": "DC native who filmed ex-DOJ worker sling Subway sandwich at federal agent speaks out\nThe Washington DC man who filmed an ex-DOJ employee hucking a Subway sandwich at a federal agent on Sunday said the man caused a \u201cruckus\u201d and even appeared to be ready to vandalize a government car before deciding to weaponize the hoagie.\nCortez Dargin, 28, a District native, witnessed the hysterical hissyfit of Sean Charles Dunn, 37, formerly of the Department of Justice, who is facing felony assault charges after the villainous hero-throwing incident.\n\u201cIn the beginning, there was a bunch of ruckus. I seen this guy walk across the street saying \u2018these guys are fascists\u2019 and everything,\u201d Dargin told The Post, laughing quietly while recalling the man\u2019s antics.\n\u201cThen he was trying to get our attention. Like he came directly towards us,\u201d Dargin said, adding that Dunn tried engaging him in conversation at several points during the minutes-long outburst.\nDunn gestured wildly with his lunch meat throughout the episode, according to the witness.\n\u201cHe asked me \u2018What car did the feds pull up in?\u2019 and I said \u2018I dunno.\u2019 He goes up to the car and I thought he was gonna do something to the car,\u201d Dargin said in reference to federal vehicles parked on the street.\nHe said Dunn seemed to be quite drunk and that served as part of the motivation for filming the meltdown.\n\u201cIt was mostly for him because, like, \u2018You were really drunk. When you see this video, when you sober up, you\u2019re gonna be like whoa,\u2019\u201d Dargin said.\nThen, to Dargin\u2019s shock, Dunn threw his foot-long sub at the federal officer, hitting him square in the chest \u2014 sending sandwich material flying.\nThe shocked witness said some of the officers were laughing at the outrageous assault, but he expressed some empathy with the agents.\n\u201cThey were learning the area and this is like your first day of training and you get a sandwich thrown at you,\u201d he said in disbelief.\nDargin revealed he got up close to the desecrated Subway sandwich, saying it appeared to be a Subway BMT, adding, \u201cAnd he liked banana peppers.\u201d\nAfter the dramatic throwing, Dunn fled with speed from the scene, leaving behind not even a trail of breadcrumbs.\n\u201cHe ran down the street and he like cut it behind some buildings and disappeared,\u201d Dargin said.\n\u201cThe craziest thing to me was the posture \u2014 the whole body movement \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen nobody move like that. He moved like a little lizard or something,\u201d he said.\nDespite his reptilian speed, Dunn was not able to evade police \u2014 or charges \u2014 for long.\nPhotos show the man wearing a pink shirt and light blue shorts cuffed and surrounded by officers on a DC street.\nThe former international affairs specialist at the DOJ is facing felony assault charges and promptly lost his job.\n\u201cIf you touch any law enforcement officer, we will come after you,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday."

The girl was rushed to the hospital by private means but could not be saved.\nLiggon died the day before she was to resume classes at Thomas Stone High School following the summer break.\nThe 16-year-old suspect \u2014 whose name has not been released due to her age \u2014 was arrested Sunday and will also miss classes as she was ordered held without bail until her next court date, the Washington Post reported.\nThe girl, who is also from Waldorf, was charged with second-degree murder while armed and pleaded not involved \u2014 the juvenile version of not guilty \u2014 during the hearing Monday.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, someone is dead over a dispute over sauce,\u201d DC Superior Court Judge Sherri Beatty-Arthur said as she announced that the child will remain in custody until her next hearing on Friday.\nShe was found to be in possession of a knife when police handcuffed her, the Metropolitan Police said.\n\u201cShe was the only person who brought a knife to a fistfight,\u201d prosecutor Priscilla Guerrero said, according to the newspaper.\nThe teen\u2019s defense attorney claimed she acted in self-defense.\nDC officials have created a curfew for minors age 16 and younger in several parts of DC, including the U Street area, that begins on Friday.\nThe curfew, which begins at 11 p.m. on weeknights and midnight on weekends, is part of an effort to curtail juvenile violence in the district.\nLiggon was the 13th person under 18 years old killed in Washington this year \u2014 often at the hands of other minors, according to the Washington Post.\nA neighbor whose son was friends with Liggon described the teenager as \u201ca beautiful person\u201d in an interview with Fox5 Washington DC.\n\u201cShe was the first friend [my son] met when he arrived here,\u201d Rickey Graves told the local station.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 it was a shock for us because she\u2019s a beautiful person. She had a great personality, always laughing \u2014 a lot of laughter. Her mom \u2014 very friendly, beautiful people. So I\u2019m just shocked that this kind of thing would happen to her.\u201d"

Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\u201d she added. \u201cYou will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\u201d\nDunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division \u2014 which handles cases of fugitives abroad and helps foreign countries on extradition matters with their own fugitives, according to the DOJ.\nDunn appeared to have been similar to a paralegal \u2014 assisting attorneys in handling a \u201clarge volume of cases, including the litigation of those matters,\u201d according to the DOJ\u2019s job listing for the position.\nHe does not appear to be an attorney as his name isn\u2019t listed on the DC bar\u2019s website.\nAn attorney for the suspect did not immediately respond to requests for comment and attempts to contact Dunn directly were unsuccessful.\nDunn was allegedly caught on camera berating a group of federal officers as \u201cfascists\u201d before lobbing his deli sandwich and hitting a US Customs and Border Protection agent in the chest.\n\u201cF\u2014 you! You f\u2014ing fascists! Why are you here? I don\u2019t want you in my city!\u201d Dunn allegedly fumed within inches of an officer\u2019s face, per a criminal complaint.\nAccording to the complaint, Dunn successfully attempted to flee on foot, telling a local cop while he was being processed: \u201cI did it. I threw a sandwich.\u201d\nFootage of the incident went viral against the backdrop of President Trump\u2019s deployment of hundreds of federal law enforcement personnel to assist DC police in cracking down on crime.\nDunn faces one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer and faces up to one year in prison if convicted.\n\u201cThe police are not out there to get pushed around or beat up,\u201d DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro declared in announcing the case against Dunn. \u201cHe thought it was funny. Well, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny today because we charged him with a felony: Assault on a police officer.\u201d\n\u201cSo there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else!\u201d\nOn Monday, Trump federalized the DC Metropolitan Police Department for 30 days and activated the National Guard to patrol the District\u2019s streets.\nSince then, hundreds of federal officials have arrested more than 100 suspects, with 23 collared on Monday, 43 nabbed on Tuesday and 45 apprehended on Wednesday, according to data from the Trump administration.\nTrump\u2019s crackdown comes after former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee Edward Coristine \u2014 aka \u201cBig Balls\u201d \u2014 was beaten up while intervening to prevent a carjacking last week."

      "text": "Trump takes control of DC police, deploying National Guard in historic capital crime crackdown \u2014 and warns NYC could be next\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced a sweeping crime crackdown in DC on Monday, placing the city\u2019s police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the streets \u2014 while warning New York City could be next.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor \u2014 and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\nTrump vowed to \u201cclean it up real quick,\u201d \u201clike we did on the southern border\u201d with illegal immigration.\nThe Home Rule Act, which granted DC self-governance in 1973, allows the president to assert emergency control of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for 30 days. Congress can pass a joint resolution extending his control, which would require a bare majority in the Republican-held House and Senate.\nDocuments formalizing the takeover were transmitted to Congress Monday afternoon and DC police officials set up a meeting later in the day with White House officials to discuss the new arrangement.\nTerry Cole, the Senate-confirmed administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will temporarily lead the 3,400-officer MPD under the supervision of Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump said.\nIt was not immediately clear how the National Guard deployment will proceed \u2014 including numbers and neighborhoods where they will be sent \u2014 but members of that force historically assist law enforcement in a supporting role and do not have the ability to make arrests.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d Monday night, said Guardsmen from DC and \u201cother states\u201d would be deployed to the district \u201cthis week and in coming weeks\u201d to act as \u201cforce multipliers\u201d for local and federal law enforcement.\n\u201cThey will be standing right alongside our federal agents, like they were in Los Angeles. They\u2019re going to be proactive. If you take an action or a shot at them, there will be a consequence,\u201d Hegseth told host Laura Ingraham.\nThe Pentagon chief added that the troops will be allowed to \u201cinterdict\u201d and \u201ctemporarily detain\u201d individuals if they see a crime in progress and local law enforcement isn\u2019t nearby, \u201clike we did in Los Angeles.\u201d\nHegseth didn\u2019t say how many National Guard members would be activated in DC, or how long they would be patrolling the streets, describing the length of their mission as \u201cconditions-based.\u201d\nJustifying his action Monday morning, the president displayed a chart showing that DC has more murders per capita than the capital cities of cocaine-exporting Columbia, cartel-plagued Mexico, and terrorist hub Iraq.\n\u201cWe doubled up on Baghdad,\u201d Trump commented.\n\u201cYou people are victims of it too. You are reporters and I understand a lot of you tend to be on the liberal side. But you don\u2019t want to get mugged and raped and shot and killed. And you all know people, friends of yours, where that\u2019s happened.\u201d\nTrump cited many high-profile recent crimes in the capital, including the Aug. 3 attack on former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, 19, during an alleged attempted carjacking and the June 30 murder of congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, in a drive-by shooting.\nTrump also mentioned the 2023 carjacking of Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the near-fatal stabbing of an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) the same year by a \u201cdemented lunatic\u201d and the shooting death of a three-year girl in July.\nThe president described criminals lawlessly cruising about town on unauthorized ATVs and motorbikes and said he planned to beautify the District by fixing road medians, broken marble and potholes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums too\u2026I know it\u2019s not politically correct,\u201d Trump said, teasing apparent plans to get rid of public housing in high-property-value DC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums where they live.\u201d\nHomeless encampments will also be removed from all public places, including in parks and underpasses, the president vowed, while the US Park Police \u2014 under the control of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 will be responsible for the removal of graffiti.\nDC officials say they won\u2019t resist\nDistrict Mayor Muriel Bowser, an elected Democrat, confirmed Monday afternoon that she would comply with the federal takeover.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to work every day to make sure it\u2019s not a complete disaster, let me put it that way,\u201d Bowser said at her own press conference, at which she called Trump\u2019s move \u201cunsettling and unprecedented.\u201d\n\u201cThe main point is this: Everybody should follow the law, the police and the community. And that\u2019s the case now, it was the case last week and it was the case the week before,\u201d she said.\nThe mayor added that she was particularly concerned about making sure that \u201call law enforcement be identifiable by uniform, a badge, a jacket, so that people know that they are law enforcement.\u201d\nTrump first ordered federal officials, including members of the FBI, DEA and Border Patrol, onto the streets of DC the night of Aug. 7-8. Photos circulating on social media and in the press showed those agents wearing clearly identifying uniforms.\nMPD Chief Pamela Smith confirmed she had a meeting set for later Monday with two federal officials, whom she did not name, about next steps.\nSmith added she was interested in receiving help to enforce outstanding warrants for criminal suspects, saying there are \u201cthings that the federal government is also very useful for.\u201d\n\u201cThis will be an opportunity for us to come together and collaborate on being able to go out and execute warrants,\u201d the police chief said.\nAhead of Trump\u2019s announcement, Bowser told MSNBC on Sunday that \u201cwe do need the federal government\u2019s help\u201d and specifically requested assistance rebuilding the city jail.\nBowser recently invoked curfews in parts of the city in a bid to keep teens off the street as early as 7 p.m., but also has claimed crime rates are going down in the city, pointing to official data.\nTrump claimed Monday that the numbers were \u201cphony\u201d and promised that Bondi will be \u201clooking into that.\u201d\nThe president noted that DC police commander Michael Pulliam, whose district included the densely populated Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights neighborhoods, was suspended last month for allegedly falsifying crime data to make trends appear more positive.\nPulliam\u2019s police union defended him and accused MPD leadership of ordering subordinates to falsify violent crime data.\nDC Police Union chairman Gregg Pemberton endorsed Trump\u2019s takeover, saying in a Fox News interview: \u201cWe completely agree with the president that crime in the District of Columbia is out of control and something needs to be done with it.\u201d\nNew York, Chicago, LA in crosshairs\nTrump announced at his press conference that other cities may be next, saying at one point that \u201cI\u2019m going to look at New York in a little while\u201d \u2014 and also name-checking Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cYou look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting very strongly with DC, and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly as they say.\u201d\nTrump additionally announced plans for federal legislation that would override state laws barring judges from applying cash bail requirements to criminal defendants.\nIf necessary, Trump added, ordinary military members could be deployed to join the National Guard and the local cops.\nThe president has direct control over DC\u2019s National Guard, unlike every other unit, which is under the authority of state governors.\n\u201cWashington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump summed up his plans, \u201cand we\u2019re going to make it that.\u201d"
