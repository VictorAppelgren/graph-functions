Each of the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer is void in all jurisdictions where it is prohibited. If materials relating to the New Bonds Offering or the Tender Offer come into a holder's possession, the holder is required by Brazil to inform itself of and to observe all of these restrictions. The materials relating to the New Bonds Offering or the Tender Offer, including this communication, do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the New Bonds Offering or the Tender Offer be made by a licensed broker or dealer and a Dealer Manager or any affiliate of a Dealer Manager is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the New Bonds Offering or the Tender Offer, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be made by the Dealer Manager or such affiliate on behalf of Brazil in that jurisdiction. Owners who may lawfully participate in the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms thereof are referred to as \"holders.\"\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities nor will there be any sale of the New Bonds or the Tender Offer in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. The offering of the New Bonds and the Tender Offer will be made only by means of the New Bonds Offering prospectus supplements and the accompanying prospectus and an offer to purchase in Canada, under applicable exemptions from any prospectus or registration requirements.\n\nThe Tender Offer is made in Austria to existing holders of the Old Bonds only.\n\nThe distribution of materials relating to the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer and the transactions contemplated by the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer of these securities will be made only by means of the preliminary prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus. No prospectus pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC (the \"Prospectus Regulation\") or the Austrian Capital Market Act (\"Kapitalmarktgesetz\") has been or will be approved (gebilligt) by or notified (notifiziert) to the Austrian Financial Market Authority (Finanzmarktaufsicht) and no such prospectus has been or will be published in Austria in any way which would constitute a public offering under Austrian law (whether presently or in the future). The information in the Offer materials (e.g., preliminary prospectus, accompanying prospectus supplement, prospectus) is being made available in Austria for the sole purpose of providing information about the securities described therein solely to individually qualified investors in Austria. The information contained in the Offer materials is being made available on the condition that it is solely for the use of the recipient as a potential and individually qualified investor and may not be passed on to any other person or reproduced in whole or in part.\n\nThere has been no offer, sale or delivery and there will be no offer, sale or delivery of any bonds in Austria other than in accordance with provisions of the Prospectus Regulation and of the Austrian Capital Market Act; and any offering material relating to the New Bonds will be distributed in Austria only under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Prospectus Regulation and of the Austrian Capital Market Act.\n\nIn Belgium, the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer are not directly or indirectly, being made to, or for the account of, any person other than to qualified investors (gekwalificeerde beleggers/investisseurs qualifi\u00e9s) within the meaning of Article article 2, e) of the Prospectus Regulation, as amended or replaced from time to time (Belgian Qualified Investor), that do not qualify as consumers (consumenten/consommateurs) within the meaning of Article I.1, 2\u00b0 of the Belgian Code of Economic Law of February 28, 2013 (Wetboek van economisch recht/Code de droit \u00e9conomique), as amended or replaced from time to time (Consumers). A Consumer within the meaning of Article I.1, 2\u00b0 of the Belgian Code of Economic Law is any natural person who is acting for purposes which are outside their trade, business, craft or profession.\n\nAs a result, the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer do not constitute a public takeover bid pursuant to Articles 3, \u00a71, 1\u00b0 and 6, \u00a7 1 of the Belgian law of April 1, 2007 on public takeover bids (Wet op de openbare overnamebiedingen/Loi relative aux offres publiques d'acquisition), as amended or replaced from time to time.\n\nConsequently, the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer and any material relating thereto have not been and will not be, notified or submitted to, nor approved by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (Autoriteit voor Financi\u00eble Diensten en Markten/Autorit\u00e9 des Services et March\u00e9s Financiers) pursuant to the Belgian laws and regulations applicable to the public offering or tendering of securities.\n\nThe New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer as well as any materials relating thereto may not be advertised, nor distributed, directly or indirectly, to any person in Belgium other than Belgian Qualified Investors acting for their own account who are not Consumers, and may not be used in connection with any offering in except as may otherwise be permitted by law.\n\nThe New Bonds Offering cannot be considered to be a regulated investment service such as investment advice as listed under Annex I to the European Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (MiFID II), as amended or replaced from time to time.\n\nThe New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer may not be offered or sold to the public in Brazil. Accordingly, the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer have not been nor will be registered with the Brazilian Securities Commission - CVM nor have they been submitted to the foregoing agency for approval. Documents relating to the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer, as well as the information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public in Brazil, as the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer is not a public offering of securities in Brazil, nor used in connection with any offer for subscription or sale of securities to the public in Brazil.\n\nThe New Bonds may be sold and the Tender Offer is made in Canada only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations, and who are not individuals. Any resale of the New Bonds must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws.\n\nThe New Bonds and the Old Bonds will not be registered under Chilean Law No. 18,045, as amended, with the Comisi\u00f3n para el Mercado Financiero de Chile (Financial Market Commission of Chile or \"CMF\") and, accordingly, the New Bonds and the Old Bonds cannot and will not be offered or sold to persons in Chile except in circumstances which have not resulted and will not result in a public offering under Chilean law, and in compliance with Norma de Car\u00e1cter General (Rule) No. 336, dated June 27, 2012, issued by the CMF.\n\nThe New Bonds may not be offered, sold or negotiated in Colombia, except in compliance with Part 4 of Decree 2555 of 2010. The Offer to Purchase and the New Bonds Offering prospectus supplements and the accompanying prospectus do not constitute and may not be used for, or in connection with, a public offering as defined under Colombian law.\n\nThe New Bonds are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of the following:\n\n(a) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, \"MiFID II\"); or\n\n(b) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 as amended, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.\n\nConsequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the \"PRIIPs Regulation\") for offering or selling the New Bonds or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the New Bonds or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.\n\nThis announcement does not constitute an offer to the public in France. It is not a prospectus within the meaning of the Prospectus Regulation.\n\nNo prospectus (including any amendment, supplement or replacement thereto) has been prepared in connection with the New Bonds Offering that has been approved by the French Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (\"AMF\") or by the competent authority of another Member State of the EEA and notified to the AMF under the Prospectus Regulation; the materials relating to the New Bonds have not been distributed or caused to be distributed and will not be released, issued or distributed or caused to be released, issued or distributed, directly or indirectly, to the public in France, or used in connection with any offer for subscription, exchange or sale of the bonds to the public in France. Any such offers, sales and distributions have been and shall only be made in France to (i) qualified investors (investisseurs qualifi\u00e9s) acting for their own account, and/or to (ii) investment services providers authorized to engage in portfolio management services on behalf of third parties and/or to (iii) a limited group of investors (cercle restreint d'investisseurs) acting for their own account, all as defined in, and in accordance with, Articles L.411-2, II, D.411-1, D.411-4, D.744-l, D.754-l and D.764-1 of the French Code mon\u00e9taire et financier.\n\nIn the event that the New Bonds purchased or subscribed by investors listed above are offered or resold, directly or indirectly, to the public in France, the conditions relating to public offers set forth in Articles L.411-1, L.411-2, L.412-1 and L.621-8 to L.621-8-3 of the French Code mon\u00e9taire et financier must be complied with. Investors in France and persons into whose possession offering materials come must inform themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions.\n\nThe Tender Offer is made in Federal Republic of Germany (\"Germany\") to existing holders of the Old Bonds only.\n\nThe prospectus supplement does not constitute a prospectus compliant with the Prospectus Regulation and does therefore not allow any public offering in Germany. No action has been or will be taken in Germany that would permit a public offering of the New Bonds, or distribution of a prospectus or prospectus supplement or any other offering material relating to the New Bonds. In particular, no prospectus (Prospekt) within the meaning of the Prospectus Regulation and the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierprospektgesetz) or any other applicable laws in Germany has been or will be published in Germany, nor has any prospectus or the prospectus supplement been filed with or approved by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) for publication in Germany.\n\nThis prospectus supplement is strictly for use of the person who has received it. It may not be forwarded to other persons or published in Germany.\n\nThe Old Bonds and New Bonds may not be offered or sold and will not be offered or sold in Hong Kong by means of any document other than (a) in circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32, Laws of Hong Kong) (the \"CWUMPO\"), or (b) to \"professional investors\" as defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) (the \"SFO\") and any rules made thereunder, or (c) in other circumstances which do not result in the document being a \"prospectus\" as defined in the CWUMPO.\n\nNo advertisement, invitation or document relating to the Old Bonds or New Bonds has been or will be issued, or has been or will be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the securities laws of Hong Kong) other than with respect to the Old Bonds or New Bonds which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to \"professional investors\" as defined in the SFO and any rules made thereunder.\n\nThe Old Bonds and the New Bonds, and the Offer to Purchase and the New Bonds Offering prospectus supplements and the accompanying prospectus, and any other documents or materials related to such offers have not and will not be registered with the Italian Securities Exchange Commission (Commissione Nazionale per le Societ\u00e0 e la Borsa or \"CONSOB\") pursuant to applicable Italian laws and regulations.

Each intermediary must comply with the applicable laws and regulations concerning information duties vis \u00e0 vis its clients in connection with the bonds or the relevant offering.\n\nThe New Bonds have not been and will not be registered under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan (Act No. 25 of 1948, as amended, the \"Financial Instruments and Exchange Act\") and each Joint Book-Running Manager has represented and agreed that it has not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell any New Bonds, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any resident of Japan (as defined under Article 6, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act of Japan (Act No. 228 of 1949, as amended)), or to others for re-offering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, a resident of Japan, except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of, and otherwise in compliance with, the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and any other applicable laws, regulations and ministerial guidelines of Japan.\n\nIn Luxembourg, this announcement has been prepared on the basis that the offer of the New Bonds, the Tender Offer and the potential exchange offer will be made pursuant to an exemption under Article 1 (4) of the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of securities.\n\nNeither the Offer to Purchase or the New Bonds Offering prospectus supplements and accompanying prospectus, nor any other documents or materials relating to the Tender Offer or the New Bonds Offering have been approved by or will be submitted for the approval of, the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores; the \"CNBV\") and, the New Bonds have not been and will not be registered with the Mexican National Securities Registry (Registro Nacional de Valores) maintained by the CNBV, and therefore the Old Bonds and New Bonds have not and may not be offered or sold publicly in Mexico. However, investors that qualify as institutional or qualified investors pursuant to the private placement exemption set forth in article 8 of the Mexican Securities Market Law (Ley del Mercado de Valores), may be contacted in connection with, and may participate in the Tender Offer and New Bonds Offering, and can be offered with or purchase New Bonds. The participation in the Tender Offer or the acquisition of New Bonds will be made under such investor's own responsibility.\n\nNeither the New Bonds Offering nor the Tender Offer is intended for any person who is not qualified as an institutional investor, in accordance with provisions set forth in Resolution SMV No. 021-2013-SMV-01 issued by Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores (Superintendency of Capital Markets) of Peru, and as subsequently amended. No legal, financial, tax or any other kind of advice is hereby being provided.\n\nThe New Bonds Offering prospectus supplements and accompanying prospectus, and the Offer to Purchase have not been and will not be registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Neither the New Bonds Offering nor the Tender Offer constitutes an offering of securities in Singapore pursuant to the Securities and Futures Act, Chapter 289 of Singapore (the \"SFA\").

Each of the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer is void in all jurisdictions where it is prohibited. If materials relating to the New Bonds Offering or the Tender Offer come into a holder's possession, the holder is required by Brazil to inform itself of and to observe all of these restrictions. The materials relating to the New Bonds Offering or the Tender Offer, including this communication, do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the New Bonds Offering or the Tender Offer be made by a licensed broker or dealer and a Dealer Manager or any affiliate of a Dealer Manager is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the New Bonds Offering or the Tender Offer, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be made by the Dealer Manager or such affiliate on behalf of Brazil in that jurisdiction. Owners who may lawfully participate in the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms thereof are referred to as \"holders.\"\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities nor will there be any sale of the New Bonds or the Tender Offer in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. The offering of the New Bonds and the Tender Offer will be made only by means of the New Bonds Offering prospectus supplements and the accompanying prospectus and an offer to purchase in Canada, under applicable exemptions from any prospectus or registration requirements.\nThe Tender Offer is made in Austria to existing holders of the Old Bonds only.\nThe distribution of materials relating to the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer and the transactions contemplated by the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer of these securities will be made only by means of the preliminary prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus. No prospectus pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC (the \"Prospectus Regulation\") or the Austrian Capital Market Act (\"Kapitalmarktgesetz\") has been or will be approved (gebilligt) by or notified (notifiziert) to the Austrian Financial Market Authority (Finanzmarktaufsicht) and no such prospectus has been or will be published in Austria in any way which would constitute a public offering under Austrian law (whether presently or in the future). The information in the Offer materials (e.g., preliminary prospectus, accompanying prospectus supplement, prospectus) is being made available in Austria for the sole purpose of providing information about the securities described therein solely to individually qualified investors in Austria. The information contained in the Offer materials is being made available on the condition that it is solely for the use of the recipient as a potential and individually qualified investor and may not be passed on to any other person or reproduced in whole or in part.\nThere has been no offer, sale or delivery and there will be no offer, sale or delivery of any bonds in Austria other than in accordance with provisions of the Prospectus Regulation and of the Austrian Capital Market Act; and any offering material relating to the New Bonds will be distributed in Austria only under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Prospectus Regulation and of the Austrian Capital Market Act.\nIn Belgium, the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer are not directly or indirectly, being made to, or for the account of, any person other than to qualified investors (gekwalificeerde beleggers/investisseurs qualifi\u00e9s) within the meaning of Article article 2, e) of the Prospectus Regulation, as amended or replaced from time to time (Belgian Qualified Investor), that do not qualify as consumers (consumenten/consommateurs) within the meaning of Article I.1, 2\u00b0 of the Belgian Code of Economic Law of February 28, 2013 (Wetboek van economisch recht/Code de droit \u00e9conomique), as amended or replaced from time to time (Consumers). A Consumer within the meaning of Article I.1, 2\u00b0 of the Belgian Code of Economic Law is any natural person who is acting for purposes which are outside their trade, business, craft or profession.\nAs a result, the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer do not constitute a public takeover bid pursuant to Articles 3, \u00a71, 1\u00b0 and 6, \u00a7 1 of the Belgian law of April 1, 2007 on public takeover bids (Wet op de openbare overnamebiedingen/Loi relative aux offres publiques d'acquisition), as amended or replaced from time to time.\nConsequently, the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer and any material relating thereto have not been and will not be, notified or submitted to, nor approved by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (Autoriteit voor Financi\u00eble Diensten en Markten/Autorit\u00e9 des Services et March\u00e9s Financiers) pursuant to the Belgian laws and regulations applicable to the public offering or tendering of securities.\nThe New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer as well as any materials relating thereto may not be advertised, nor distributed, directly or indirectly, to any person in Belgium other than Belgian Qualified Investors acting for their own account who are not Consumers, and may not be used in connection with any offering in except as may otherwise be permitted by law.\nThe New Bonds Offering cannot be considered to be a regulated investment service such as investment advice as listed under Annex I to the European Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (MiFID II), as amended or replaced from time to time.\nThe New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer may not be offered or sold to the public in Brazil. Accordingly, the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer have not been nor will be registered with the Brazilian Securities Commission - CVM nor have they been submitted to the foregoing agency for approval. Documents relating to the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer, as well as the information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public in Brazil, as the New Bonds Offering and the Tender Offer is not a public offering of securities in Brazil, nor used in connection with any offer for subscription or sale of securities to the public in Brazil.\nThe New Bonds may be sold and the Tender Offer is made in Canada only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations, and who are not individuals. Any resale of the New Bonds must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws.\nThe New Bonds and the Old Bonds will not be registered under Chilean Law No. 18,045, as amended, with the Comisi\u00f3n para el Mercado Financiero de Chile (Financial Market Commission of Chile or \"CMF\") and, accordingly, the New Bonds and the Old Bonds cannot and will not be offered or sold to persons in Chile except in circumstances which have not resulted and will not result in a public offering under Chilean law, and in compliance with Norma de Car\u00e1cter General (Rule) No. 336, dated June 27, 2012, issued by the CMF.\nThe New Bonds may not be offered, sold or negotiated in Colombia, except in compliance with Part 4 of Decree 2555 of 2010. The Offer to Purchase and the New Bonds Offering prospectus supplements and the accompanying prospectus do not constitute and may not be used for, or in connection with, a public offering as defined under Colombian law.\nThe New Bonds are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of the following:\n(a) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, \"MiFID II\"); or\n(b) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 as amended, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.\nConsequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the \"PRIIPs Regulation\") for offering or selling the New Bonds or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the New Bonds or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.\nThis announcement does not constitute an offer to the public in France. It is not a prospectus within the meaning of the Prospectus Regulation.\nNo prospectus (including any amendment, supplement or replacement thereto) has been prepared in connection with the New Bonds Offering that has been approved by the French Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (\"AMF\") or by the competent authority of another Member State of the EEA and notified to the AMF under the Prospectus Regulation; the materials relating to the New Bonds have not been distributed or caused to be distributed and will not be released, issued or distributed or caused to be released, issued or distributed, directly or indirectly, to the public in France, or used in connection with any offer for subscription, exchange or sale of the bonds to the public in France. Any such offers, sales and distributions have been and shall only be made in France to (i) qualified investors (investisseurs qualifi\u00e9s) acting for their own account, and/or to (ii) investment services providers authorized to engage in portfolio management services on behalf of third parties and/or to (iii) a limited group of investors (cercle restreint d'investisseurs) acting for their own account, all as defined in, and in accordance with, Articles L.411-2, II, D.411-1, D.411-4, D.744-l, D.754-l and D.764-1 of the French Code mon\u00e9taire et financier.\nIn the event that the New Bonds purchased or subscribed by investors listed above are offered or resold, directly or indirectly, to the public in France, the conditions relating to public offers set forth in Articles L.411-1, L.411-2, L.412-1 and L.621-8 to L.621-8-3 of the French Code mon\u00e9taire et financier must be complied with. Investors in France and persons into whose possession offering materials come must inform themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions.\nThe Tender Offer is made in Federal Republic of Germany (\"Germany\") to existing holders of the Old Bonds only.\nThe prospectus supplement does not constitute a prospectus compliant with the Prospectus Regulation and does therefore not allow any public offering in Germany. No action has been or will be taken in Germany that would permit a public offering of the New Bonds, or distribution of a prospectus or prospectus supplement or any other offering material relating to the New Bonds. In particular, no prospectus (Prospekt) within the meaning of the Prospectus Regulation and the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierprospektgesetz) or any other applicable laws in Germany has been or will be published in Germany, nor has any prospectus or the prospectus supplement been filed with or approved by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) for publication in Germany.\nThis prospectus supplement is strictly for use of the person who has received it. It may not be forwarded to other persons or published in Germany.\nThe Old Bonds and New Bonds may not be offered or sold and will not be offered or sold in Hong Kong by means of any document other than (a) in circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32, Laws of Hong Kong) (the \"CWUMPO\"), or (b) to \"professional investors\" as defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) (the \"SFO\") and any rules made thereunder, or (c) in other circumstances which do not result in the document being a \"prospectus\" as defined in the CWUMPO.\nNo advertisement, invitation or document relating to the Old Bonds or New Bonds has been or will be issued, or has been or will be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the securities laws of Hong Kong) other than with respect to the Old Bonds or New Bonds which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to \"professional investors\" as defined in the SFO and any rules made thereunder.\nThe Old Bonds and the New Bonds, and the Offer to Purchase and the New Bonds Offering prospectus supplements and the accompanying prospectus, and any other documents or materials related to such offers have not and will not be registered with the Italian Securities Exchange Commission (Commissione Nazionale per le Societ\u00e0 e la Borsa or \"CONSOB\") pursuant to applicable Italian laws and regulations. The Tender Offer and the New Bonds Offering are being carried out pursuant to the exemptions provided for, with respect to the Tender Offer, in Article 101 bis, paragraph 3 bis of Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998, as amended (the \"Consolidated Financial Act\") and Article 35 bis, paragraph 4, of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of 14 May 1999, as amended; and, with respect to the New Bonds Offering, in article 1, paragraph 4, letter c), of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.\nHolders or beneficial owners of the Old Bonds that are resident and/or located in Italy can tender the Old Bonds for purchase, and the New Bonds can be offered, sold and delivered, through authorized persons (such as investment firms, banks or financial intermediaries permitted to conduct such activities in Italy in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, the Consolidated Financial Act, the CONSOB Regulation No. 20307 of 15 February 2018, as amended, and Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, as amended) and in compliance with any other applicable laws and regulations or with any requirements imposed by CONSOB or any other Italian authority.
