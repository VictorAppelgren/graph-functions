      "feedback": "The draft is coherent and correctly links Fed cuts → 2‑yr/10‑yr steepening → DXY, but it is verbose, repeats the same causal chain, and mixes short‑term and medium‑term outlooks without a clear hierarchy. Tighten the narrative to a single, forward‑looking view: **DXY will fall ~200 bp to 95.8 by Aug 31, then rise 0.5–1 % over the next 3–6 months as the September 25‑bp cut steepens the curve and expands the real‑yield differential**. Remove all redundant sentences that restate the same point (e.g., the two “Fed’s scheduled 25‑bp cut” paragraphs). Add a concise risk table: (1) Fed reversal → immediate DXY dampening; (2) tariff enforcement → spread compression → lower DXY; (3) PCE/NFP below expectations → weaker yield advantage. Explicitly cite each risk with the appropriate source ID. Condense the “short‑term upside” paragraph into a single sentence: **PCE > 3 % or NFP above forecasts on Aug 30/31 could lift DXY 50–100 bp** (cite 7XH2DKEKV). Ensure every claim has a citation; for example, the 4.20–4.25 % 10‑yr band cite U21K4ALYQ and 97MD1FHW8. Finally, replace the “Confidence: Moderate” line with a quantified confidence band (e.g., “Confidence: 70 %”), and list the watch list: Sep Fed meeting, Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP, 10‑yr yield, tariff policy. This will satisfy the length/format constraints, eliminate drift, and provide a crisp, actionable view.",
