  "title": "Michael Goodwin: Mamdani\u2019s NYC borough tour attacking Trump smacks of amateur hour",
  "description": "It seems as if it was only yesterday that Zohran Mamdani was running to be mayor of New York on an agenda he vowed would solve the \u201caffordability crisis.\u201d",
  "content": "It seems as if it was only yesterday that Zohran Mamdani was running to be mayor of New York on an agenda he vowed would solve the \u201caffordability crisis.\u201d\n\nHe won the Democratic primary by pledging that wealthier New Yorkers would pay higher taxes so his City Hall could afford lots of free stuff for everyone else.\n\nApparently that\u2019s all it took to solve the crisis.\n\nBecause just like that, the 33-year-old socialist assemblyman is saying he has a new agenda for the general election.\n\nHe\u2019s now running against President Trump, calling him an enemy and vowing \u201cMy administration will be Donald Trump\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d\n\nThis week he\u2019s touring the five boroughs, one borough per day, with a steady stream of warnings that the president\u2019s policies will hurt the city, and that Mamdani should be elected to resist him.\n\nHe reportedly plans to mostly ignore his three main rivals and save his firepower for Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to paint the president as Public Enemy No. 1.\n\nHe began by accusing Trump of kicking more than 1 million New Yorkers off Medicaid, cutting funding for food stamps and slashing funding for housing programs.\n\n\u201cWe know that there is no borough that will be free from Trump\u2019s cruelty,\u201d he said.\n\nMamdani\u2019s next step was to dirty up his three main rivals by linking them to Trump.\n\nHe says former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Adams and GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa should be disqualified from consideration because, he claims, they have cozy relationships with Trump.\n\nMamdani said in a radio interview the \u201cpresident has three candidates in this race \u2014 one that he\u2019s directly been in touch with, another he bailed out of legal trouble and now functionally controls, and the final one literally being a member of the same Republican Party.\u201d\n\nThe decision to appeal to New Yorkers by attacking the president of the United States, a former New Yorker, smacks of amateur hour.\n\nWhile there are certainly legitimate issues to raise about Mamdani\u2019s opponents, overstating their connections to Trump and making that a defining issue is not persuasive.\n\nNeither is turning the president into a toxic bogeyman.\n\nAll three denied being close to Trump, with Cuomo foolishly trying to compete with Mamdani by saying, \u201cNobody has fought with Trump more than I have.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, Trump loves New York and makes it clear he wants to help his hometown and state.\n\nFor Mamdani to bite the hand that could feed the city merely to score cheap political points reveals his ignorance of history and of the necessity of City Hall having strong connections to the White House, no matter the party of the president.\n\nHis calling Trump an enemy before he\u2019s even been elected flips a seminal event on its head. Recall the legendary Daily News headline from 1975 when President Gerald Ford declined a bailout \u00adrequest.\n\nThe words \u201cFord to City, Drop Dead\u201d helped set in motion bipartisan efforts that eventually got results, all captured in a recent documentary.\n\nA version of that headline based on Mamdani\u2019s approach would declare: \u201cCity to Trump, Drop Dead.\u201d\n\nKnowing what we know about Trump, attacks will not get the federal help the next mayor will need.\n\nLeaving aside whether Mamdani\u2019s effort to link his opponents to the president will play well in the November election, it strikes me as a stupendously bad idea for a city official or candidate to attack the president to score political points.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s malpractice for a mayor or governor to spurn the president and by extension the federal government over partisan differences.\n\nThe odds of winning anything that way are low and the price of losing is far too high to make it a sensible bet.\n\nConsider some areas where the feds hold the purse strings and can offer other help.\n\nHousing, education, health care, mass transit, highways, bridges, airports, tunnels, prisons, borders, tax policies on nonprofits and the overall economy.\n\nLaw enforcement depends on the feds for financial aid and operational support.\n\nAny political upside to Mamdani would be transitory, while the damage to the welfare of New Yorkers could be severe and permanent.\n\nAll the more so when that president is Trump, who is a man of action and a prolific counterpuncher.\n\nHe has called Mamdani a \u201ccommunist lunatic,\u201d to which The New York Times responds by saying \u201cMr. Mamdani is a democratic socialist.\u201d\n\nGiven Mamdani\u2019s radicalism, the change is a distinction without a difference.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to federalize policing in the nation\u2019s capital and mobilize the National Guard is consistent with his view that high crime levels in urban areas should not be tolerated.\n\nIt\u2019s also true the police commander of the nation\u2019s capital was suspended after being suspected of manipulating data to downplay serious offenses.\n\nAlthough Trump talks about making a similar federalizing move in New York, the situations are very different, with the NYPD turning in record-low numbers of shootings.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s no thanks to Mamdani and his core supporters, many of whom echo his scurrilous calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d and his claims that all cops are racists.\n\nHe simply doesn\u2019t understand or respect police work, and it\u2019s impossible to imagine he would have the trust of the NYPD.\n\nAnother area where Mamdani is out of touch is his call for higher taxes.\n\nEven Gov. Hochul, a big tax-and-spender herself, rejects his plan.\n\nShe admits the state\u2019s sky-high taxes already drove many New Yorkers to Florida.\n\nIt\u2019s also noteworthy that Hochul and other top Dems have not celebrated that Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d increased the allowable deductions of state and local taxes (SALT) from $10,000 per family to $40,000.\n\nThat marks a major concession to GOP representatives from blue states.\n\nThe $10,000 limit, which took effect in 2017, led Cuomo and other Dems to argue it was a rocket aimed at destroying blue states.\n\nIn fact, the higher deductions go mostly to high income families, which is why Dems never tried to raise the SALT limits during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.\n\nNow that Trump has reduced the incentive for many taxpayers to leave New York, you would think Dems would celebrate.\n\nBut it\u2019s apparently asking too much for Sen. Chuck Schumer, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Hochul and Mamdani to even admit that the change benefits New Yorkers, even though no state Dems supported it.\n\nThey would rather demonize Trump than acknowledge he \u00addelivered a tax cut for the state\u2019s residents.\n\nHis promise to cut taxes is a reason why Trump got nearly 44% of the vote in New York last year.\n\nThat kind of reaction has Hochul frightened about her re-election next year and has Republicans optimistic about keeping Congress in the 2026 midterms.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that tax rates matter, a lesson Gotham voters must teach Mamdani in \u00adNovember.",

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani can\u2019t stop talking about Andrew Cuomo\u2019s rent-stabilized dig during anti-Trump NYC tour\nSo much for Zohran Mamdani\u2019s ballyhooed anti-President Trump tour.\nThe Democratic socialist on Tuesday again spent a stop on his weeklong \u201cFive Boroughs Against Trump\u201d tour instead bashing his mayoral election rival Andrew Cuomo \u2014 calling the pugilistic ex-gov \u201cpetty\u201d amid their escalating spat over Mamdani\u2019s $2,300 rent-stabilized apartment.\nEven when Mamdani spoke about Trump, he attempted to tie the president to Cuomo, arguing the two hotheaded Queens natives share many similarities.\n\u201cWe must remember that Andrew Cuomo has spent more time talking about my apartment than asking why so many New Yorkers are being forced out of theirs,\u201d Mamdani said at his \u201cBrooklyn Against Trump\u201d event.\n\u201cHe has spent more time criticizing me than he has criticizing the legislation that Donald Trump has passed.\u201d\nCuomo, in the latest salvo in what he has ambitiously dubbed \u201c#Rentgate,\u201d demanded on X Tuesday that Mamdani cough up his lease to prove he didn\u2019t have his highbrow parents \u2014 a famed filmmaker and an accomplished academic \u2014 co-sign his one-bedroom Astoria apartment.\nThe nasty feud comes as Cuomo, who\u2019s running as an independent in November after a humiliating loss to Mamdani in the Democratic mayoral primary, hopes to take the wind out of his rival\u2019s sails.\nThe bare-knuckle Cuomo clearly hopes a scorched-earth campaign will make up much needed ground, said Andrew Kirtzman, managing director of the consulting firm Actum.\n\u201cIt seems like (Cuomo) thinks he\u2019s getting traction with these rent-stabilization attacks,\u201d Kirtzman said.\n\u201cMaybe he has, maybe he hasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think that most New Yorkers are going to become as outraged over this as Cuomo wants them to be.\u201d\nBut Cuomo hitting Mamdani where he lives \u2014 and proposing \u201cZohran\u2019s Law\u201d targeting supposedly privileged New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized homes \u2014 has clearly irked the usually sunny socialist.\nThe speakers at Mamdani\u2019s event \u2014 a Who\u2019s Who of progressive Big Apple lawmakers, including Public Advocate Jumaane Williams \u2014 attacked Trump for pushing a 40% cut to Big Apple housing assistance.\nMamdani, who pulls $142,000 a year as a state assemblyman and lives in a $2,300-a-month rent-stabilized Astoria apartment, himself focused on Cuomo\u2019s proposed law.\nHe noted Cuomo is calling to require New Yorkers wanting a rent-stabilized apartment to spend at least 30% of their income, which is the level that experts and US Census Bureau consider households to be rent-burdened.\n\u201cThis policy is indicative of so much of Andrew Cuomo\u2019s politics, where it works backwards from a petty vindictiveness, and it does not care who it harms in the process,\u201d Mamdani said.\nMamdani\u2019s spokeswoman Dora Pekac declined to comment on the candidate\u2019s lease, but was unapologetic about linking Cuomo and Trump.\n\u201cAndrew Cuomo has called the president for political advice, aligned himself closely with him on matters personal and political, and is co-signing his dangerous authoritarian spirals,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPut simply: Andrew Cuomo is complicit in the terror Donald Trump is wreaking on working New Yorkers \u2014 and we must never allow our city to forget or forgive him for it.\u201d"

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program.

      "text": "Trump tells Chuck Schumer to \u2018GO TO HELL\u2019 over Senate nominee deal after negotiations blow up\nPresident Trump blasted Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and told him to \u201cGO TO HELL\u201d as a fight over confirming executive branch political nominees boiled over and dozens of potential appointees were left in limbo.\nTrump had wanted the Senate to stay in session and clear up the backlog of presidential appointees, but a deal between Republicans and Democrats to push through the nominees fell apart.\nSenators went home for their August recess without confirming a slate of Trump\u2019s nominees \u2014 leaving the president fuming.\n\u201cSenator Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer is demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees, who should right now be helping to run our Country,\u201d the president fumed on Truth Social.\n\u201cThis demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name. Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!\u201d\nMany Republicans had been hoping to get just over 130 nominees from the backlog confirmed before the August recess.\nMany of these types of civilian nominees breeze through the Senate via voice vote or unanimous confirmation. But Democrats took advantage of Senate rules to significantly delay confirmation of those picks.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) groused that no other president in recent history has faced so much obstruction.\nThune negotiated with Schumer (D-NY) on a deal to bundle up Trump\u2019s picks to allow voting for them in bulk. In one iteration of the deal, the Senate would have voted on a batch of the picks before breaking for recess, and then another chunk when the upper chamber reconvenes.\nBut it appears that Democrats wanted guarantees from Trump that he would unfreeze some of the funding his administration had cut off for foreign aid and the National Institute of Health.\n\u201cDo not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\u201d Trump added.\nSenators had been getting antsy, and tensions were high as the standoff had begun cutting into the August recess.\nThune agreed to allow the typical pro forma sessions to continue, a process by which the Senate holds ceremonial sessions to prevent presidential recess appointments, which would allow Trump\u2019s picks to get through without Senate approval.\nSome Republicans flirted with the idea and with the possibility of going \u201cnuclear\u201d and rolling back the rules that enable Democrats to hold up the nominees. However, it is unclear if the GOP has a majority for that, as many moderate Republicans want to preserve Senate norms so they can block Democratic picks when the Republicans are in the minority again.\n\u201cThere were several different times where I think either or both sides maybe thought there was a deal in the end,\u201d Thune said of negotiations with Schumer, noting there were a lot of different ideas floated.\nSchumer, who has faced constant pressure from the progressive base to put up more of a fight against Trump, later took a victory lap.\n\u201cLet me clear what happened: Donald Trump attempted to steamroll the Senate to put in place his historically unqualified nominees. But Senate Democrats wouldn\u2019t let him,\u201d Schumer said on X.\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s style: Posture[,] Cajole[,] Stamp your feet\u2026 and then give up,\u201d the top Senate Democrat later gloated on X afterwards.\nSome senators floated the idea of making rules changes when the Senate reconvenes in September, before dealing with the partial government shutdown fight.\nThey head home slightly ahead of schedule on the government shutdown showdown, having passed 3 of the 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the government and with about half of the remaining bills having cleared committee.\nThat\u2019s the first time since 2018 that the Senate has passed government funding bills before breaking for August recess, according to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins (R-Maine). If Congress fails to take action, the government will enter a partial shutdown on Oct. 1."

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani takes Andrew Cuomo war to the next level \u2014 attempting to link rival with Jeffrey Epstein in new campaign video\nMayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani is going nuclear on rival Andrew Cuomo \u2014 attempting to link the ex-governor to Jeffrey Epstein in a new scorched-earth campaign video.\nIn the 90-second, TikTok-style spot, Mamdani, looking into the camera, demands that Cuomo release his list of consulting clients, noting the ex-gov once worked on a luxury marina project with a pal, Andrew Farkas, whose former business partner was Epstein.\n\u201cIn June, the New York Times found out that Cuomo worked with his longtime friend Andrew Farkas on a luxury marina project in Puerto Rico. Farkas\u2019 previous partner on Caribbean luxury marinas was none other than Jeffrey Epstein,\u201d Mamdani says.\nThe mudslinging from Mamdani comes days after Cuomo hammered the socialist for snagging a $2,300, rent-stabilized apartment in Astoria despite his family\u2019s apparent wealth. Cuomo even proposed \u201cZohran\u2019s Law\u201d to prevent well-to-do residents from obtaining rent-restricted apartments.\nThe new spot starts with Mamdani noting that Cuomo \u201cresigned in disgrace and you probably know why\u201d \u2014 then shows footage and articles about women who accused the then-gov of sexual misconduct and the controversy surrounding his nursing home policies during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Democratic mayoral nominee demands that Cuomo release the list of clients from Innovative Strategies LLC, the consulting firm he launched in 2022 after he exited the governor\u2019s office.\nMamdani gripes in the video that Cuomo has not divulged who paid him.\nBut published reports have said Cuomo worked for a crypto currency exchange based in the Seychelles that eventually pleaded guilty to operating illegally in the US.\nThe Democratic socialist Queens assemblyman also notes that Cuomo did not initially disclose $2.6 million in stock options from a nuclear company to the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board.\n\u201cHis excuse? The stocks were technically owned by Innovation Strategies LLC \u2014 where Cuomo is the sole member,\u201d Mamdani says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing about Andrew Cuomo: Once you think you\u2019ve learned all the scandals, you find out there\u2019s another. And another. And another. \u201c\nCuomo can clear the air, Mamdani says, adding: \u201cHabibi \u2014 release your client list.\u201d\nA rep for Cuomo gleefully responded that they could \u201csmell the desperation from conspiracy peddling\u201d in Mamdani\u2019s attack.\n\u201cHe [Cuomo] didn\u2019t know Epstein, but you can smell the desperation from conspiracy-peddling Zohran seeping through your screen,\u201d said Cuomo campaign spokesman Richard Azzopardi.\nThe former governor \u2014 who is running as an independent in the November election after getting soundly bested by Mamdani in the Democratic primary \u2014 also has vehemently denied he sexually harassed anyone.\nOne campaign strategist said Mamdani\u2019s ad was a \u201cgutsy move\u201d \u2014 and likely a response to Cuomo scoring points by hitting him for his rent-stabilized apartment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gutsy move. Mamdani is defining Cuomo to general election voters on his terms,\u201d said O\u2019Brien \u201cOB\u201d Murray, who has run campaigns for Republicans and Democrats.\nHe said Mamdani is not leaving it to campaign surrogates to do the dirty work and is willing to go toe to toe with Cuomo.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a page out of Donald Trump\u2019s playbook. When the candidates say something about an opponent, voters pay attention to it,\u201d Murray said.\nBut Mamdani risks \u201ctarnishing\u201d his image by getting in the mud with Cuomo, even if he wants to keep the focus on the ex-gov\u2019s past scandals, said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist University Institute for Public Opinion.\n\u201cThe Cuomo people are probably happy to draw a response. They want to engage Mamdani,\u201d Miringoff said.\n\u201cZohran risks tarnishing his image.\u201d\nAzzopardi dismissed the video as \u201cnothing more than a temper tantrum from an insecure child of privilege who knows his tenuous lead is slipping away.\u201d\nHe said the project in question with Farkas never got off the ground, and in regards to his consultancy business, Cuomo does not comment on those \u201cprivate client matters\u201d and has not represented anyone with business before a New York city or state agency.\nAzzopardi also said the stock options were publicly disclosed in Federal Communication Commission files for years.\n\u201cThere was a question about if and how they were required to be disclosed on city filings, which, after consulting with the Conflict of Interest board, we corrected the same day the matter was brought to our attention,\u201d the Cuomo rep said.\n\u201cTry as he might, Zohran can\u2019t distract from the rank hypocrisy of growing up wealthy, owning hundreds of thousands of dollars of land in a country that has the death penalty for LGBTQIA people and making more than $140K a year for a job he doesn\u2019t show up to while taking a rent-stabilized apartment meant for a working New Yorker, not to mention his flip-flopping on the defund the police and supporting pro-Hamas criminals like the Holy Land Five,\u201d Azzopardi said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a total fraud and with every passing day, New Yorkers see it.\u201d"

      "text": "More than six months into President Trump\u2019s highly consequential second term, Democrats are still looking for their sputtering resistance movement to deliver some big victories.\nInstead, they\u2019ve suffered repeated failures and are responding with an increasingly angry radicalism that has zero appeal to the hearts and minds of most voters.\nA recent Wall Street Journal poll found that a mere 33% of national respondents hold a favorable view of Dems, which the Journal called the party\u2019s lowest point in its polls over three decades.\nIt also found that a stunning 63% of voters hold an unfavorable view of the party.\nThose dismal results are the fruit of a run of bad candidates \u2014 think Kamala Harris and Tim Walz \u2014 and a scattershot strategy that consistently defies common sense and traditional American middle-class values.\nThe impression is that party leaders and high-profile advocates are lurching from one temper tantrum about Trump to another, each delivered with the desperation of a Hail Mary pass.\nThey seem more concerned about the welfare of illegal immigrants, including gang-bangers, than about the physical safety and financial security of innocent, taxpaying Americans.\nComes now the latest example of their zany agenda, this one courtesy of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\nIn a few brief remarks Monday, she managed to prove that the passing years have not dimmed her gift for poor judgment and terrible ideas.\nMajor party headache\nHer new brainstorm threatens to become another major headache for her party.\nAppearing in Gotham with socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, Warren declared that \u201cNew York City is the place to start the conversation for Democrats on how affordability is the central issue, the central reason to be a Democrat, and that delivering on it in meaningful, tangible ways that will touch working families is why we\u2019re here.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a pretty strange thing to say given that it was almost exclusively Democratic mayors, governors and lawmakers who created the affordability crisis she now bemoans.\nShe went on to claim that Mamdani, the 33-year-old nepo-baby radical who won the Dems\u2019 mayoral primary, should be the party\u2019s national face.\n\u201cBring it on!\u201d Republicans say, convinced that he would be a major drag for Dems in the 2026 elections.\nThe GOP would be delighted to run against a party that features a radical leftist who\u2019s never held a real job in his life.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that four years ago, then-Mayor-elect Eric Adams declared himself \u201cthe new face of the Democratic Party.\u201d\nThe idea never gained much traction, with his tenure soon swamped by the tide of illegal border crossers waved in by Joe Biden, as hundreds of thousands made their way to New York for free housing, food and medical care.\nAdams never quite recovered, and that was even before he faced federal corruption charges brought under Biden that the Trump Justice Department dropped.\nNonetheless, the turmoil and critical coverage were such a burden that Adams passed up his party\u2019s primary and is seeking re-election in November as an independent.\nAlthough he and the NYPD deserve great credit for driving shootings to historic lows, recent polls show the mayor\u2019s support is stuck in single digits and sometimes falls below the slice of voters who say they are undecided.\nNY Dems shun him\nAs for Warren\u2019s idea about making Mamdani the national model for the party, she is so deep in fantasy land that she\u2019s even out of step with leading New York Dems.\nThey are avoiding the far-left candidate like the plague, which is what he could be politically in areas that are more balanced than the People\u2019s Republic of New York, where there is just one registered Republican for every six registered Dems.\nAnd so Gov. Kathy Hochul, US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries all have declined to endorse Mamdani, which is an exceptional rebuke to him and his platform.\nNormally, they would reflexively back the winner of the party\u2019s mayoral primary, but they look ahead and see his major positions \u2014 defund the police, hike taxes, boycott Israel and support the anti-Jewish mobs disrupting cities and college campuses \u2014 as a toxic brew that even if it prevails in the city, won\u2019t fly around the rest of the state or across the nation.\nThey see him as a major burden next year, when Hochul will be seeking re-election and Schumer and Jeffries will be trying to guide Dems to victory in their respective chambers.\nOf the group, Hochul has been the most outspoken and explicit in shunning him.\nMamdani\u2019s plan to tax high-income New Yorkers would require legislative approval and her signature, and the governor has made it clear that\u2019s not going to happen.\nDays before the late June primary, Hochul threw cold water on the tax proposals he aims to use to fund his long list of free things, including buses and child care.\n\u201cI\u2019m not raising taxes at a time where affordability is the big issue,\u201d she said in a TV interview.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose any more people to Palm Beach. We\u2019ve lost enough \u2026 so let\u2019s be smart about this.\u201d\nHochul\u2019s answer was surprising in that she\u2019s usually an automatic yes vote for new taxes, congestion pricing being a recent example.\nBut her answer was also clever in that she adopted Mamdani\u2019s theme of an \u201caffordability crisis\u201d and turned it on its head to use it as a reason not to support him.\nShe\u2019s right in the sense that when it comes to affordability, New York governments\u2019 addiction to high spending and taxing already are major causes.\nTrickle-down pain\nCity and state regulations also amount to a mountain of expensive red tape that discourage construction as well as business and job creation.\nHer congestion tax is a good example of the trickle-down impact.\nThe price of every loaf of bread, bottle of beer and bag of potato chips sold in Midtown now includes a portion of the added tax she slapped on delivery trucks.\nMeanwhile, the state\u2019s enormous budget reflects the way the government Mafia grabs a piece of every action.\nAlbany is spending $254 billion this year, more than $100 billion more than it spent a decade ago.\nFlorida has millions of more people than New York, but somehow manages to make do with spending $117 billion.\nThat\u2019s almost identical to the city\u2019s budget alone, which is $116 billion this year, up from $75 billion over the last decade.\nThese exploding expense budgets do not include the numerous \u201coff-the-books\u201d entities such as the MTA, public colleges and universities, the Dormitory Authority and scores of other lesser-known units that spend multiple billions of dollars they collect from the public.\nJust remember: As bad as things are, they can always get worse.\nAnd if Mamdani is elected, everything definitely would get worse."

      "text": "Michael Goodwin: The 2-state delusion must be scrapped \u2014 a \u2018jihadist\u2019 state would solve nothing\nJust months after Adolf Hitler started World War II, Winston Churchill smartly summarized why Europe\u2019s hopes for peace had been shattered.\n\u201cAn appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last,\u201d the new prime minister said in a speech.\nHis stark imagery mocked the foolish efforts to head off war, infamously led by Churchill\u2019s predecessor, Neville Chamberlain, who insisted Hitler really wanted peace.\nChamberlain was delusional and the global conflict that followed turned his name into a permanent warning about the wages of weakness.\nYet here we go again, with the current leaders of Britain, France and Canada falling into the trap.\nTheir delusion is that Palestinians, including Hamas and other terror groups, really want peace and will live in harmony with Israel once they have a nation of their own.\nThe clamor for a Palestinian state is the appeasement of our times.\nIt travels under the disguise of a \u201ctwo-state solution.\u201d\nWho can be against a solution?\n\u2018River to the sea\u2019\nExcept a Palestinian state wouldn\u2019t solve anything.\nQuite the opposite, it would set the stage for another round of bloodletting.\nAs such, think of it as the two-state delusion.\nThat\u2019s what it is because too many Islamists, from Iran to Arab lands and around the world, remain committed to destroying the Jewish state.\nThey don\u2019t want to live in peace with Israel.\nThey want to eliminate it.\nThat\u2019s the essence of the antisemitic chant heard on American college campuses: \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.\u201d\nTranslation: Palestine will be free of Jews, and Israel will be no more.\nThat isn\u2019t a problem at the Jew-hating United Nations, which held a two-day conference on the topic last week.\nIt was little noted that Palestinians already have a state of their own.\nInstead of living in peace with their Jewish neighbors, they turned Gaza into a terror state.\nNearly two years after their barbaric invasion of Israel, and while they continue to hold some of the 250 hostages they took on Oct. 7 of 2023, the push to give them a nation isn\u2019t just foolish \u2014 it\u2019s obscene.\nAs President Trump correctly said last week, \u201cYou\u2019re rewarding Hamas if you do that. I don\u2019t think they should be rewarded.\u201d\nThankfully, he added that the US is \u201cnot in that camp,\u201d referring to support for a Palestinian state by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Mark Carney.\nEach is beset by radical Islamist immigrants, and so their pandering illustrates Churchill\u2019s observation about feeding the crocodile in hopes of being spared.\nThey are aided and abetted by the Western media outlets that have fallen for the two-state ruse.\n\u2018A Hamas state\u2019\nTypical is the nakedly anti-Israel coverage of The Associated Press, which described the UN conference as a serious bid \u201cto end one of the world\u2019s longest conflicts.\u201d\nIt claimed \u201cthe plan would culminate with an independent, demilitarized Palestine living side by side peacefully with Israel.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a fairy tale, and at least deserves the caveat that it would be necessary to enforce a peaceful Palestinian state to guarantee Israel\u2019s security.\nGood luck persuading the Israelis that their security can be outsourced to the United Nations.\nJews there and around the world have said for decades: \u201cIf Palestinians lay down their guns, there will be peace. But if the Israelis lay down our guns, there will be no Israel.\u201d\nThe Jewish nation\u2019s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar said last week that Israel would not cave in to the \u201cinternational pressure.\u201d\n\u201cEstablishing a Palestinian state today is establishing a Hamas state. A jihadist state,\u201d said Sa\u2019ar.\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t gonna happen.\u201d\nThe only positive development to come out of the conference was that the Arab League, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, condemned for the first time Hamas\u2019 2023 invasion and called on the terrorists to release all hostages, disarm and end their rule of Gaza.\nBut even that progress was undercut by a tone of both-sideism that included outrageous attacks on Israel because of how it responded to the invasion.\nThe final declaration also urges Israel to cooperate with UN agencies, including UNRWA, whose employees openly fanned the flames of Hamas terror.\nIt also defends the Gazan Health Ministry, which acts as a Hamas mouthpiece in distorting Palestinian casualties.\n\u2018Right of return\u2019 farce\nWorse, the conference supported the Palestinians\u2019 so-called \u201cright of return\u201d to places in Israel they left or were expelled from during the 1948 creation of Israel.\nThat would undermine Israel\u2019s security and its existence as a Jewish state.\nMy view about the push for a Palestinian state is informed by 25 years of covering the topic.\nIn the summer of 2000, I was on my first trip to Israel just before its Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, and Palestinian chairman Yasser Arafat were scheduled to meet with President Bill Clinton at Camp David to iron out the terms and boundaries of such a state.\nThe American Embassy had helped arrange an interview for me with a top aide to Arafat in Ramallah, the de facto capital of the West Bank.\nThe night before the interview, the late Martin Indyk, then the US ambassador to Israel, suggested a question I might ask.\nIt ran something like this: If Arafat can\u2019t accept the 92% of the West bank Barak\u2019s government is offering, how would Arafat feel when a more conservative government offers as little as 72% of the West Bank?\nWhen I asked the question, the Arafat aide responded with a phrase he\u2019d used in response to other questions about Arab violence.\n\u201cWell, you know,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are these groups we can\u2019t control.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t name names, but his meaning was clear: There will be violence against Israelis, but don\u2019t blame Arafat because he can\u2019t stop it.\nNo partner in peace\nIt was a convenient lie, but the terror leader obviously feared for his own life if he signed a deal.\nMuch to the shock of Clinton and Barak, Arafat walked away from Camp David without accepting a Palestinian state.\nSince then, several Israeli governments have made similar offers of a Palestinian state.\nAll have been rejected in part because of the Sadat example.\nRecall that Egypt\u2019s bold leader, Anwar-el Sadat, was assassinated in 1981 by Islamist extremists two years after signing a peace treaty with Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Menachem Begin in a process facilitated by President Jimmy Carter at Camp David.\nSadat and Begin shared the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize.\nYet 47 years later, there is still no Palestinian state because no Palestinian leader has felt safe enough to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist in its own secure borders.\nHamas has made it clear it will never accept Israel. Its leaders have promised that given the chance, the horrors of Oct. 7 will be repeated again and again.\nThe threats prove that a point Israelis have made about Palestinians still prevails: We have no partner for peace."

Kathy Hochul isn\u2019t ready to endorse socialist Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral run yet, she said Thursday \u2013 as she slammed his plans to raise taxes on the rich.\n\u201cI\u2019m focused on affordability and raising taxes on anyone does not accomplish that,\u201d she told reporters during an event at LaGuardia Airport.\n\u201cI\u2019m making sure that people who create jobs will stay here so that we can have good paying jobs.\u201d\nHochul\u2019s wait-and-see approach on Mamdani came after the Queens assemblyman bested former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary \u2013 sending shockwaves across the nation and prompting soul-searching among moderate members of the party over its leftward drift.\nThe Democratic governor had congratulated Mamdani after his apparent win, but notably didn\u2019t endorse him in November\u2019s general election.\nMamdani\u2019s campaign made waves with his people-pleasing proposals, such as free buses, city-run grocery stores, a rent freeze and raising the minimum wage to $30 an hour by 2030.\nBut the Democratic mayoral nominee\u2019s many detractors have cast his promises \u2013 which carry a $10 billion a year price tag \u2013 as unrealistic and unaffordable.\nFollow The Post\u2019s coverage of the NYC mayoral race\n- Top NY Dems \u2018freaking out\u2019 over \u2018absolute insanity\u2019 of Mamdani taking over NYC: Mike Lawler\n- Eric Adams tells \u2018Pod Force One\u2019 socialist Zohran Mamdani\u2019s \u2018false promises\u2019 are sure to harm lower-income New Yorkers\n- Andrew Cuomo staying on NYC mayoral election ballot \u2014 as critics slam ex-gov as \u2018spoiler\u2019 candidate\n- Adams pulls in massive $1.5M haul for re-election after Cuomo\u2019s embarrassing Dem primary defeat\n- Cuomo blasted for \u2018cringe, inauthentic\u2019 campaign ad where he jump starts man\u2019s car\nMamdani has proposed a 2% tax hike on New York City\u2019s millionaires and another increase targeting big corporations to pay for his platforms.\nBut he\u2019d need approval from Albany lawmakers and Hochul to raise taxes \u2014 and neither the state legislature nor the governor has an appetite for his proposal.\n\u201cAs an assembly member, Mr. Mamdani knows that the state legislature and the governor has enormous say over decisions like those,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cSo, we have a new session coming up, I\u2019m always open to have conversations, whatever capacity he\u2019s in.\n\u201cObviously there\u2019s areas of difference in our positions, but I also think that we need to have those conversations.\u201d\nAs Hochul \u2014 who is up for re-election in 2026 \u2014 distanced herself from Mamdani\u2019s socialist proposals, she also tried to claim he won on an affordability platform similar to her own.\nThe governor signed off on a massive $254 billion budget for next year that includes free school lunches, a middle class tax cut and \u201cinflation refund\u201d checks up to $400.\nMayor Eric Adams, a centrist Democrat, is running for re-election as an independent in the general \u2013 and Hochul said for now she\u2019s going to keep \u201cworking close\u201d with him.\nHochul praised Adams\u2019 \u201cCity of Yes\u201d housing push and efforts to keep subways safe.\n\u201cWe\u2019re six months away from inauguration day, and that will determine who I\u2019m working with for the next four years,\u201d she said."

As mayor, I will convene a Charter Revision Commission and put real issues like sanctuary city laws and whether Rikers should be closed before the people.\u201d\nSliwa is ranked either third or fourth in most recent mayoral polls, behind Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Adams and Cuomo, both Dems, are running as independents because Mamdani is the Democratic nominee.\nAdams\u2019 campaign didn\u2019t return messages."

      "text": "The decision by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to have the Israeli military capture Gaza City and then occupy all of Gaza is a bad idea.\nIn fact, it is the worst possible idea \u2014 except for all the alternatives.\nThese include letting Hamas keep power in Gaza endlessly and effectively consigning the remaining 20 living hostages to more torture and certain death.\nAnother even worse possibility is that soft-headed Western leaders join the antisemites at the United Nations and reward Hamas\u2019 terror campaign by making Gaza the centerpiece of a Palestinian state.\nFacing a global lineup of Jew haters, there is no option for Netanyahu that would gain wide support, let alone universal backing.\nIsrael\u2019s isolation is astounding in light of the fact that we are nearing the second anniversary of the Hamas invasion that killed more Jews in one day than on any day since the Holocaust.\nAnd yet Israel is widely condemned for trying to win the war Hamas started.\nAn obvious conclusion is that the present course of fruitless negotiations with Hamas about a cease-fire is unsustainable.\nLast month, just days after the White House had expressed optimism about a deal, President Trump got it exactly right when Hamas pulled out of the negotiations.\n\u201cIt was too bad, Hamas didn\u2019t really want to make a deal. I think they want to die and it\u2019s very, very bad,\u201d the president told reporters, adding: \u201cIt got to a point where you\u2019re going to have to finish the job,\u201d a phrase widely seen as offering support for Israel to expand its military offensive, as Netanyahu (pictured) now aims to do.\nAsked about full Israeli occupation of Gaza, Trump also said: \u201cI really can\u2019t say. It is going to be pretty much up to Israel.\u201d\n\u2018Last card we have left\u2019\nAn aide told Axios that the president, who had recently offered criticism of Netanyahu, was deeply moved by the Hamas video of Israeli hostage, 24-year-old Evyatar David, seen being forced to dig what is likely his own grave.\n\u201cIt influenced the president, and he is going to let the Israelis do what they need to do,\u201d the official said.\nThat\u2019s the only sensible position because Hamas has shown repeatedly it isn\u2019t interested in signing a cease-fire and hostage deal that Israel can accept.\nAgainst that reality, it\u2019s hard to argue with Netanyahu\u2019s conclusion that only added military pressure can change the terrorists\u2019 calculations.\nAn aide to Netanyahu put it this way in a media statement: \u201cWe are not willing to remain in the current limbo and we are not willing to surrender to Hamas\u2019 demands \u2014 so essentially only one option is left, to take a drastic step. This is the last card we have left.\u201d\nAnother unsustainable factor is the jerry-rigged humanitarian aid system that has seen Hamas gunmen hijack the vast majority of aid trucks meant for Gaza\u2019s civilians, many of whom reportedly suffer from malnutrition and some are said to be starving.\nThose aid trucks are crucial, but as the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy notes, a recent UN report concluded \u201cthat between May 19 and Aug. 5, more than 2,600 trucks carrying humanitarian aid crossed from Israel into Gaza.\u201d\nHowever, only 300 of these trucks reached their intended destinations in Gaza, with the vast majority, totaling some 2,309 trucks, \u201cintercepted and looted along their delivery routes.\u201d\n\u2018They want casualties\u2019\nTrue to cowardly form, the UN report did not distinguish between the parties responsible for the thefts, noting only that the aid was stolen by \u201ceither armed actors or hungry people.\u201d\n\u201cArmed actors\u201d is a euphemism for Hamas, but the UN is too cowardly to say even that.\nDespite the thefts, Israel is repeatedly accused of intentionally starving women and children.\nSomebody might be intentionally starving the civilians, but it\u2019s not Israel.\nIn fact, the whole aid system stems from the ridiculous assertion that it is up to Israel to feed and house the civilians whose suffering is the direct result of Hamas\u2019 invasion and its evil defense strategy of using its own people as human shields.\nAs Netanyahu said, \u201cThey want people to be civilian casualties. They want a starvation policy that they themselves are trying to put into being. And we\u2019re doing everything to reverse that.\u201d\nSadly, much of the western media is indistinguishable from Al Jazeera in parroting Hamas and blaming Israel for everything.\nThe disgusting trend reached a gutter low when The New York Times published a sickening photo on the top of the front page of its July 25th edition of a mother holding a tiny, sickly-looking baby.\nThe caption claimed \u201cMohammed Zakaria al-Mutawaq, about 18 months, with his mother, Hedaya al-Mutawaq, who said he was born healthy but was recently diagnosed with severe malnutrition.\u201d\nThe caption added that \u201cA doctor said the number of children dying of malnutrition in Gaza had risen sharply.\u201d\nUnder the caption, the story headline declared: \u201cYoung, Old and Sick Starve to Death in Gaza: \u2018There Is Nothing\u2019\u201d\nThe point was unmistakable: Israel is starving children to death.\nAfter an outcry, five days later, the Times ran what it called an editor\u2019s note that upended the claims of the initial photo.\nThe note read: \u201cThis article has been updated to include information about Mohammed Zakaria al-Mutawaq, a child in Gaza suffering from severe malnutrition.\u201d\nIt continued: \u201cAfter publication of the article, The Times learned from his doctor that Mohammed also had pre-existing health problems.\u201d\n\u2018War crime\u2019\nThe Times has yet to explain why it failed to confirm the facts before it rushed to print what was effectively a blood libel against Israel.\nSoft-selling the egregious lapse as needing merely an \u201ceditor\u2019s note\u201d is the sort of \u201cfix\u201d that is appropriate when a person\u2019s middle initial is wrong, not when the error is crucial both to the photo and the story about starvation the photo supposedly illustrates.\nThe fact that Israel is up against not only Hamas but many western governments and their leftist media outlets helps explain why the Security Cabinet quickly approved Netanyahu\u2019s plan for the takeover of Gaza City.\nThe resolution said residents will have until Oct. 7 to evacuate.\nThe choice of that ominous date was hardly an accident.\nPredictably, Hamas condemned the Netanyahu plan as a \u201cfull-fledged war crime\u201d and promised it would exact a \u201chigh cost.\u201d\nGermany also declared its opposition by saying it would impose a partial arms embargo on Israel.\nThat may or may not matter, depending on Israel\u2019s next steps and that of regional nations.\nNetanyahu said he aims to turn Gaza over to unspecified \u201cArab forces\u201d after Hamas is finally defeated.\nThat\u2019s easier said than done, and it may be that he was merely calling the Arab states\u2019 bluff.\nSo far, none have volunteered for the job.\nThey claim to care about the Palestinians, but not enough to actually do anything to help them when given the chance.\nThe Arab states, like most of the world, would rather just condemn Israel."

      "text": "Top NY Dems \u2018freaking out\u2019 over \u2018absolute insanity\u2019 of Mamdani taking over NYC: Mike Lawler\nHudson Valley Rep. Mike Lawler believes that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other top New York Democrats are \u201cfreaking out\u201d over socialist Zohran Mamdani\u2019s victory in last month\u2019s mayoral primary.\nLawler (R-NY) said he believes reporting by journalist Mark Halperin that Jeffries (D-NY) quietly feels that if Mamdani becomes mayor, Democrats won\u2019t be able to take back control of the House.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s right,\u201d Lawler told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Wednesday of Halperin\u2019s report. \u201cI think they are betwixt and between. You see [New York Gov.] Kathy Hochul, [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries freaking out about the prospects of having a Marxist lead the financial capital of the world.\u201d\n\u201cThey understand this is a disaster, not only for Democrats, but for the country.\u201d\nHalperin, the former political director of ABC News and the co-founder of online broadcaster 2WAY, claimed earlier this week that \u201cHakeem Jeffries strongly believes that if Mamdani wins, he [Jeffries] can\u2019t win the majority,\u201d citing \u201cpeople who\u2019ve spoken directly with the leader.\u201d\nSpokespeople for Jeffries have called that report \u201cpatently false.\u201d\nSo far, Jeffries has declined to endorse Mamdani, who once compared the minority leader to notorious segregationist George Wallace and questioned his progressive bona fides.\nThe two Democrats met in person last week \u2014 without Jeffries announcing an endorsement \u2014 and the minority leader plans to have another confab with Mamdani after the mayoral candidate returns from his marriage celebration in his native Uganda.\nLawler, who announced Wednesday that he will vie for his swing seat again in 2026 rather than challenge Hochul, gloated over the predicament mainstream Democrats face.\n\u201cThis is absolute insanity to have somebody who says that he wants to seize the means of production, that he wants to ban private property ownership, that he wants to freeze the rent, that he wants free bussing and mass transit, and he wants government-run grocery stores,\u201d he said of Mamdani.\n\u201cThey understand this is a disaster in the suburban districts like mine that determine the outcome of control of Congress, and that\u2019s why they haven\u2019t yet endorsed him. But at the same token, they can\u2019t run too far away from him.\u201d\nRepublicans currently hold a 219-212 House majority, and Democrats are currently favored to retake the House following next year\u2019s midterms \u2014 in large part due to historical trends.\nIn every midterm election since 1938, the president\u2019s party has lost House seats, with the exceptions of 1998 (Democrats gained five House seats) and 2002 (Republicans gained eight House seats).\nRepublicans are hoping that other factors, including Mamdani, could change that dynamic."

The last of those, Phoenix House, opened in July in Manhattan, City Hall officials said.\nWith the changes, enrollment at city clubhouses will double to 6,600 members by 2027, the officials said.\nThe centers are operated by nonprofits and offer health, social and job resources to members with varying degrees of psychological troubles.\nMembers also have jobs and responsibilities at the clubhouses, such as giving tours, serving food, cleaning and helping out at the reception area.\nManhattan now has four clubhouses; Brooklyn and The Bronx have three each; Queens has two; and Staten Island has one.\nThe city health department also plans to gather and analyze more data on members, according to Health Commissioner Michelle Morse.\n\u201cPart of our goal is actually to really improve the data and demonstrate the outcomes,\u201d Morse said.\nCity officials celebrated the initiative as part of Adams\u2019 \u201cEnd the Culture of Anything Goes\u201d campaign, which highlights his administration\u2019s work on mental health.\nHizzoner took the podium to cheers from Venture House members, who will now be able to use the brand new Bronx clubhouse because of the investment, according to City Hall.\n\u201cI am at home here,\u201d Adams said, crying at times during his address.\nThe Adams administration nearly doubled previous investments in mental health clubhouses, but the focus on larger locations, edged out nine smaller clubhouses that were no longer eligible to apply for Department of Health contracts because of new capacity requirements.\nSix of the smaller clubhouses have been able to maintain operations because the City Council carved out $5 million in funding over the last two annual budgets.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with city council, who\u2019s been supporting some of the additional clubhouses,\u201d Morse said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very thankful, of course, that there are lots of clubhouses across the city.\u201d"
