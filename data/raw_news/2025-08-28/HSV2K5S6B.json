  "title": "What Next For Ruben Amorim After Man United Debacle Against Grimsby?",
  "description": "Ruben Amorim wore the look of a man who knows his future is up after Manchester United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby Town.",
  "content": "Back in May, on the final day of the last Premier League season, Ruben Amorim promised Manchester United supporters that the future was bright.\n\n\u201cThe good days are coming,\u201d the Portuguese manager told the crowd at Old Trafford, after apologizing for what he described as a \u201cdisaster season\u201d.\n\nUnited finished 15th in the Premier League, their lowest league position since they were relegated in 1974, and surrendered meekly to Tottenham in the Europa League final.\n\nThree games into the new campaign and the good days promised by Amorim in May seem as far as they have been at any point in his nine-month tenure.\n\nUnited were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby Town on penalties on Wednesday night, only the third time in 30 years they have exited the competition in the second round.\n\nThe 20-time champions of England were eliminated York City in 1995 and by MK Dons in 2014. Both of their opponents at the time were in the third tier.\n\nThe debacle at Blundell Park may be even more ignominious than the 4-0 shellacking they suffered against MK Dons at the same stage of the competition under Louis Van Gaal 11 years ago.\n\nUnited\u2019s starting XI on Wednesday night was worth over \u00a3400m ($540m) and included their new signings Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, who arrived this summer for a combined \u00a3130m ($174m).\n\nBryan Mbeumo, who joined for \u00a371m ($95m), came on in the second half.\n\nGrimsby, who are fourth in the fourth tier of English football, spent a combined \u00a33m ($4m) on their squad.\n\nIt did not matter, as the home side took a two-goal lead in the first half as Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren capitalized on mistakes from Andre Onana.\n\nMbeumo and a late goal from Harry Maguire forced the game to penalties, where Cunha had the chance to settle the tie but had his penalty saved by Christy Pym.\n\nGrimsby eventually prevailed 12-11 after Mbeumo missed the 26th penalty of the shootout by hitting the bar, condemning United to lose to a fourth-tier opponent for the first time in the competition.\n\nThe truth is United were lucky to take the game to penalties at all. Outfought and outtought by Grimsby, they looked as they have done far too often during Amorim\u2019s tenure: easy to defend against and too frail defensively.\n\nCould Ruben Amorim walk away from United?\n\nAmorim has previously hinted he would walk away from the job if the board felt he was not the right man for the job, admitting he considered his future in February and again after United lost to Spurs in the Europa League final three months later.\n\nOn Wednesday night, he again sounded like a man ready to make a decision on his future on behalf of his employers.\n\n\u201cI think the players spoke really loudly about what they want today. Something has to change, and you\u2019re not going to change 22 players again,\" he told British broadcaster ITV.\n\n\"It\u2019s hard to face everything. We move to the next game, then we have time to decide things.\u201d\n\nWhile Amorim\u2019s first nine months in charge were a near-unmitigated disaster, the Portuguese retained the full backing of United\u2019s minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and chief executive Omar Berrada.\n\nThe latter was recruited from Manchester City to replicate the same level of success and championed Amorim, who won two league titles in Portugal with Sporting, to replace Erik ten Hag in November.\n\nDespite losing 14 of his first 27 Premier League games in charge, the 40-year-old had the support of the match-going fans.\n\nThere was a recognition Amorim\u2019s predecessors had assembled a painfully lopsided squad, while the club had lacked a football structure since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in May 2013.\n\nWhatever credit Amorim had in the bank has been rapidly used up and his dogmatic devotion to his preferred 3-4-3 formation is starting to grate on many. The Portuguese\u2019s stubborn refusal to tweak his tactical approach is a major concern and could well cost him his job sooner rather than later.\n\nThere were promising green shoots in the defeat against Arsenal on the opening day of the Premier League season, a game United should have arguably won.\n\nBut they reverted to type against Fulham on Sunday, a promising start soon evaporating and they were lucky to escape Craven Cottage with a draw.\n\nThen came Wednesday night and a performance so dismal even Amorim acknowledged has to be the nadir of his tenure.\n\n\u201cThat is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the team,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it was really clear today. I would like to say very smart things and very important things but I have nothing to say.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest problem also \u2013 to see the same mistakes. I\u2019m really sorry for our fans. It\u2019s too much sometimes.\n\n\u201cYou cannot change so much \u2013 you cannot change everything in one summer. You need to win games. You need to not show this kind of performance.\u201d\n\nThen there is the issue of recruitment. United have slowly began to rectify the decade-long mess left by the Ed Wooward regime and Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo should prove to be smart signings.\n\nAnd yet, with four days left in the transfer window, they remain in desperate need of a competent goalkeeper and of a dynamic central midfielder.\n\nNeither Onana, arguably ten Hag\u2019s worst signing, nor Altay Bay\u0131nd\u0131r can be relied upon in goal and the lack of options in the middle of the park means Amorim is forced to deploy Bruno Fernandes out of position.\n\nAt the same time, United have struggled to offload players who have been jettonised by Amorim, such as Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrrel Malacia.\n\nMarcus Rashford has joined to Barcelona on loan until the end of the season, but could be back at United at the end of the season if the Catalans don\u2019t exercise their option to buy.\n\nWhether Amorim will last that long, remains to be seen. Drop points against Burnley on Saturday and United could well have a new manager in charge by the time the Premier League returns after the international break with the small matter of the Manchester derby on September 14.",

  "summary": "Manchester United's manager, Ruben Amorim, has been under pressure following a disappointing season for the club. The Portuguese manager promised to revitalize the team after promising a promising start to the season. However, they were defeated by Grimsby Town on penalties, marking only the third time in 30 years they have exited the competition in the second round. The team's starting XI, which included new signings Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, was worth over \u00a3400m ($540m) and included Bryan Mbeumo, who joined for \u00a371m ($95m). Despite this setback, AmOrim retains the full backing of United\u2019s minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and chief executive Omar Berrada. The club has been without a football team structure since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in May, and Amorims' refusal to tweak his tactical approach could cost him his job.",

      "text": "As he addressed the crowd after Manchester United\u2019s final game of the season last month, Ruben Amorim promised Old Trafford that the \u201cgood days are coming\u201d.\nIt seemed a curious message for the Portuguese to deliver, considering he had just apologized for a \u201cdisaster season\u201d.\nUnited did indeed endure a nightmare campaign, finishing 15th in the Premier League - its lowest-ever position since the league was launched in 1992 - and losing the Europa League final against Tottenham.\nOverall, it was the club\u2019s worst season since 1974, when United was relegated to what was then the Second Division.\nDespite a historically poor campaign, United stood firmly behind Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag in November, and has wasted no time to back him in the transfer window so far.\nThe trading period only began on June 1, but United has already completed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers after triggering his \u00a362.5m ($83.7m) release clause.\nThe Brazilian, who signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, could soon be joined by Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.\nUnited has tabled an opening offer of \u00a355m ($74.6m) for the Cameroon international, who has one year left on his contract.\nBetween them Cunha and Mbeumo scored 35 goals and delivered 14 assists in the Premier League and would immediately upgrade Amorim\u2019s attacking options after United scored just 44 goals in the league last term.\nBut while signings are crucial if Amorim is to succeed, and a striker and central midfielder are arguably still needed, selling players this summer is just as important for United.\nThe reasons for that are two-fold. First and foremost, failure to qualify for European competitions this season means United will only have the Premier League, FA Cup and the Carabao Cup to contend with.\nThat could effectively mean a 40-game season if United was to get knocked out of both domestic cups straight away.\nWith fewer games on the calendar, a smaller, more streamlined squad would be enough to compete on three fronts with United playing just once a week - aside from Carabao Cup commitments.\nManchester United needs a clearout\nFar more importantly, United needs to sell players to finance any spending and to comply with the Premier League\u2019s Profity and Sustainability Rules (PSR), which allow clubs to lose a maximum of \u00a3105m ($142m) over three seasons.\nIn March, United\u2019s part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe told The Times and BBC Sport that the club was in danger of going bust by Christmas, had it not been for drastic cost-cutting measures.\nThat came after in January the club had admitted being \u201cin danger of failing to comply with PSR/FFP [Financial Fair Play] requirements in future years\u201d.\nBut in the same round of interviews, Ratcliffe also insisted the club was \u201cnot going to breach PSR\u201d, allaying fears United may be hamstrung in the transfer window.\nAll the same, selling players who are surplus to requirements would allow Amorim to spend even more this summer, without falling foul of the Premier League financial rules.\nMarcus Rashford, Antony, Tyrrel Malacia and Jadon Sancho will all be returning to Old Trafford after spending last season - or part of it, in the former trio\u2019s case - on loan.\nOf the quartet, Antony is likely to be the more in-demand this summer. The Brazilian scored nine goals and registered five assists in 29 games in all competitions for Real Betis after joining the LaLiga club on loan in January.\nAn \u00a386m ($116m) signing from Ajax in the summer of 2022, Antony is the second-most expensive player in United\u2019s history but never showed signs of living up to his price-tag.\nThe Brazilian scored eight goals in 44 games in all competitions in his first season, but his output dropped to three goals in 38 appearances the following term.\nLast season, he started only three of his 14 appearances before United shipped him out on loan.\nThe spell at Real Betis has revived Antony\u2019s career, with the LaLiga club hoping to sign him permanently. Bayer Leverkusen is also said to be among the suitors, with ten Hag keen to be reunited with a player he managed at Ajax and United.\nWhile Antony\u2019s stock has risen on loan, the situation is far more complex when it comes to Rashford, the 13th-most prolific goalscorer in United\u2019s history with 138 goals, and Sancho.\nWhere next for Marcus Rashford?\nThe former moved to Aston Villa on a temporary transfer in January, scoring four goals and providing six assists in 17 appearances in all competitions and returning to the England squad in March.\nRashford started each of the four Champions League fixtures he played at Villa, but was in the starting XI in only four of his 10 appearances in the Premier League.\nA hamstring injury brought his season to a premature end at the beginning of last month, further complicating his future.\nVilla has an option to buy Rashford for \u00a340m ($50.3m), but failure to qualify for the Champions League and its precarious financial position in terms of PSR mean they may have to sell before they buy.\nThe terms of the loan deal, however, do not preclude another club from buying him for the same price, should it struck a deal with both United and the player.\nRashford is under contract with United until June 2028 and earns about \u00a3365,000 ($495,000) a week, wages which could prove to be a stumbling block from most clubs outside of the Premier League.\nStill only 27, the England international should in theory be at the peak of his powers.\nConversely, he hasn\u2019t hit the double-digit mark in terms of Premier League goals in the past two seasons.\nMore significantly, Amorim criticized his contribution and questioned his commitment.\n\"Imagine a talent like Rashford, our team should be so much better with him, but he has to change,\" he said in January.\n\"If he changes, we are more than welcome to include him, and we need it. But in this moment we have to set some standards. We are waiting for Rashford, if he wants it really bad.\u201d\nJadon Sancho faces Manchester United exit\nSancho faces a similar predicament after his loan spell at Chelsea ended this week.\nThe Blues signed the 25-year-old on a temporary transfer last summer with an obligation to buy worth up to \u00a325m ($33.7m).\nHowever, after failing to agree terms with Sancho, Chelsea opted to pay a \u00a35m ($6.7m) penalty charge to pull out of the deal.\nSancho was considered one of European soccer\u2019s outstanding talents when he joined United from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2021 for \u00a385m ($115m), a fee which remains the fourth-highest ever paid by the club.\nBut he never reached the same heights at Old Trafford, scoring a combined 12 goals in all competitions in two seasons despite starting 56 of his 79 appearances.\nHe was loaned back to Dortmund in the summer of 2023 after he publicly fell out with ten Hag, who had questioned his commitment.\nSancho joined Chelsea at the beginning of the season, scoring five goals and providing ten assists in 42 games in all competitions as the Blues secured Champions League qualification and won the Europa Conference League.\nAccording to The Athletic, Sancho has options in England and abroad and will make a decision on his future this summer.\nThe winger earns north of \u00a3250,000 ($340,000) a week and his contract runs out in 12 months, with United unlikely to trigger its option to extend the deal by a further year.\nUnited could also consider offers for Rasmus Hojlund, who has scored just 14 goals in two Premier League seasons after signing from Serie A side Atalanta in a deal worth up to \u00a372m ($97.7m) in the summer of 2023.\nThe Danish striker has been an unmitigated disaster for United, albeit partly due to having to feed off scraps in a team that doesn\u2019t create enough chances.\nA return to Italy has been mooted, with Inter Milan and Juventus both interested to sign the striker on loan.\nUnited will look very different once the season starts in August. Whether it will be enough to deliver the \u201cgood days\u201d Amorim promised, remains to be seen."

      "text": "Marcus Rashford\u2019s move to Barcelona falls into that all too rare category of football transfers as it represents a win-win scenario for all parties involved.\nThe LaLiga giants completed the signing of the England international on loan last week, in a deal that includes an option to buy for \u00a326m ($35m).\nBarcelona had been looking to add an experienced player to their squad as cover for both the left wing and centre-forward position and Rashford, who made his debut on Sunday in a friendly against Japanese side Vissel Kobe, fits the profile.\nThe Catalans had made Athletic Club winger Inaki Williams their main target and were ready to trigger his \u00a350.3m ($67.9m) release clause.\nDespite agreeing personal terms with the club and the player, Barcelona pulled out of the deal after Williams demanded an exit clause to be included in the contract, should the Catalans fail to register him with LaLiga.\nWith Liverpool\u2019s \u00a387m ($117m) valuation of Luis Diaz considered too steep, Barcelona diverted their attention to Rashford.\nSignificantly cheaper than Williams and Diaz, the 27-year-old is a calculated gamble for the Catalans.\nShould Rashford rediscover the form that had made him one of the most in-demand forwards in European football five years ago, Barcelona will have a real asset on their hands.\nConversely, should he continue to struggle as he did at Manchester United under Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim, Barcelona can ship him back to Old Trafford at the end of the season.\nThe deal is also major success for Rashford and United. The former had wanted to leave his boyhood club after falling out with Amorim, while United were eager to get his \u00a3325,000-a-week ($438,000) salary off the books.\n\u201cI want to win the biggest trophies and feel like Barcelona is a huge club in the football world so it is the perfect place,\u201d Rashford said at his unveiling by the Spanish club.\n\u201cYou see with the team last season, they have a young ambitious team and I want to add my qualities, my personality, improve the team and help them win.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a club where people\u2019s dreams come true and they win big prizes. And what the club stands for really means a lot to me as well. It feels like home and this is a big factor in my choice to come here.\u201d\nCan Marcus Rashford rediscover his form?\nRashford moved to Aston Villa on loan in January, scoring four goals and providing six assists in 17 appearances in all competitions and returning to the England squad in March.\nHe started each of the four Champions League fixtures he played at Villa, but was in the starting XI in only four of his 10 appearances in the Premier League before a hamstring injury brought his season to a premature end in May.\nVilla had an option to buy Rashford for \u00a340m ($50.3m), but failure to qualify for the Champions League and their precarious financial position in terms of the Premier League\u2019s Profity and Sustainability Rules (PSR) meant they decided against it.\nFor his part, Rashford had long indicated Barcelona was his dream move and he becomes the first British player to join the Blaugrana since Mark Hughes and Gary Lineker signed from United and Everton respectively in 1986,\nHe was linked with a move to the Camp Nou back in 2019 and again in 2022, when his stock was far higher than it is now.\nA loan move to Catalonia was mooted in January, but never materialized.\n\u201cI was clear on my preference from the beginning. It didn\u2019t work out in January so I went to Aston Villa and enjoyed a good period there,\" he said.\n\"I\u2019m very grateful for the opportunity to play there. The summer came around very quickly, it was time to make another decision.\n\"My choice was easy. It\u2019s a family club, something I\u2019m used to from my past.\u201d\nRashford scored 30 goals in all competitions in the 2022-23 season, but hasn\u2019t hit the double-digit mark in terms of Premier League goals in the past two campaigns.\nHe scored seven goals in all competitions for United last term, but last featured in the Europa League against Viktoria Plzen on December 12.\nAmorim subsequently criticized his perceived lack of effort and once Rashford returned to Manchester earlier this summer, he was one five players along with Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia told to train away from the first squad.\nUnited, meanwhile, took the No10 jersey off Rashford and handed it to new signing Matheus Cunha, who arrived from Wolverhampton in June after they triggered his \u00a362.5m ($83.7m) release clause.\nIt is a dramatic fall from grace for the 27-year-old, who signed a five-year deal at Old Trafford in 2023 after hitting a career-best 30 goals in all competitions only two years ago.\n\u201cThe situation with United is, the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while,\u201d Rashford said of United during his presentation in Barcelona.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything bad to say about Manchester United, it\u2019s been an important part of not only my career but my life.\n\"I am grateful for the opportunity to play for them but football is the same as life and not everything goes as simply as you may have thought.\n\u201cI just wish them all the best. I hope they are successful in the future.\u201d\nWill Barcelona be able to register Marcus Rashford?\nWhile Rashford\u2019s move to Catalonia suits all parties, Barcelona face a more immediate problem in the shape of being able to register him.\nThe Spanish giants have had longstanding issues registering players due to LaLiga\u2019s strict financial regulations.\nLast year, the Spanish government had to intervene to allow Barcelona to complete the registration of Dani Olmo and Pau Victor.\nLaLiga maintains that Barcelona are over their salary limit, as they have spent more on transfer and wages last season than they made in revenue.\nIn theory at least, that means Rashford cannot be registered to play this season and neither can fellow new signings Joan Garcia, Wojciech Szczesny and Roony Bardghji.\nIt is why Williams wanted an exit clause included in his deal, which Barcelona sporting director Deco refused.\nBarcelona can now either move some of their high earners off the books or find some new revenue streams to allow them to register their new signings.\nPlayers who are not registered with LaLiga cannot play in any domestic competition in Spain, nor in the Champions League.\nOver the years, Barcelona have pulled several \u201cfinancial levers\u201d to increase revenue, the latest being the sale of 25 years of future income from 475 VIP boxes at the Camp Nou - whose reconstruction is still not complete - back in December."

      "text": "It\u2019s been a typically busy summer for Premier League clubs so far, with over $2.34 billion (\u00a31.77 billion) spent on transfers, as per from Transfermarkt.\nLiverpool set a new British transfer record by signing Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for $158 million (\u00a3116 million), while Arsenal have finally landed Viktor Gyokeres after a long pursuit.\nManchester City have reshaped their squad after finishing empty-handed last season, while across town United have signed Matheus Cunha and Brian Mbeumo for a combined $177 million (\u00a3135 million) .\nBut with another month still to go before the transfer window shuts, a number of high profile players could still be on the move.\n1. Alexander Isak\nThere really is no other man to start this list with. Alexander Isak is the most-wanted man in English football and if Liverpool have their way he will be wearing red come the end of the transfer window.\nThroughout the summer, all along Newcastle\u2019s stance has been that the Sweden international is not for sale, but their resolve is being tested.\nIsak, who is under contract for two more years with the Magpies, did not travel on their pre-season tour to Singapore and South Korea and has told the club he intends to explore new options.\n\u201cI would love to believe all possibilities are still available to us,\" Newcastle manager Eddie Howe admitted last week.\n\"My wish is that he stays, but that\u2019s not in my full control.\u201d\nNewcastle are understood to want at least \u00a3120m ($160m) for the 25-year-old, who has scored 62 goals in 109 appearances in all competitions since joining from Real Sociedad three years ago.\nBut even if their financial demands were to be met - the fee would represent a record transfer for a British club - Newcastle may struggle to replace Isak with just over a month left in the transfer window and world class strikers at a premium.\n2. Ollie Watkins\nFrom one striker who wants to leave his current club to one who may have to be sacrificed for financial purposes.\nAston Villa are walking a financial tightrope when it comes to meeting the Premier League\u2019s Profity and Sustainability Rules (PSR), a task made even harder by their failure to qualify for the Champions League last season.\nIn that respect, selling Ollie Watkins makes sense, even though his departure would leave Unai Emery\u2019s worryingly short of options up front.\nAccording to The Athletic, Watkins, who scored 16 goals in the Premier League last season, was on Manchester United\u2019s radar before the club opted to pursue a deal for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko instead.\nUnited were reportedly spooked by Villa\u2019s \u00a360m demands for a player who will turn 30 this season.\nCould Newcastle, who are also chasing Sesko, turn to Watkins next should they fail to land the Slovenia international?\n3. Jack Grealish\nIt is only four years since Jack Grealish became the most expensive British player in history as he signed for Manchester City for \u00a3100m ($133m) and only two years since he helped them with the Treble.\nBut time moves quickly in football and Grealish found himself at the periphery of Pep Guardiola\u2019s plans last term, starting just seven Premier League games.\n\u201cI know that he can do it, because I saw him,\u201d the City manager said in January, suggesting Grealish\u2019s application fell somewhat short of the required standards.\n\"I saw his level and I want that, every single training session and every single game.\u201d\nLeft out of the squad for the Club World Cup in June, Grealish\u2019s spell in Manchester is surely over.\nPredicting his next move is more complicated, as high wages could provide a major stumbling block for any potential suitors. Like Watkins, Grealish turns 30 this year and with a World Cup on the horizon he needs to be playing regularly to convince Thomas Tuchel he deserves an England call-up.\n4. Eberechi Eze\nIt has not been a particularly good summer for Crystal Palace so far.\nRelegated from the Europa League into the less prestigious Europa Conference League following an administrative imbroglio, the Eagles have made just two signings so far, much to Oliver Glasner\u2019s frustration.\nAnd the German\u2019s mood could sour further were the Eagles to lose Eberechi Eze, who scored the winner in last season\u2019s FA Cup final.\nArsenal are understood to be interested in signing the England international, but Palace want a fee of at least \u00a367.5m ($89.7m) including bonuses.\nSuch a significant windfall may speed up Palace\u2019s recruitment, but losing a player of Eze\u2019s calibre would be a major blow for Glasner.\n5. Marc Guehi\nEberechi Eze may not be the only Crystal Palace star through the departure gates at Selhurst Park this summer, with club captain Marc Guehi also tipped for a move.\nThe England centre-back is in the final year of his contract and is on the radar of both Newcastle and Liverpool, after attracting interest from Chelsea in the January transfer window.\nLast summer, Palace rebuffed Newcastle\u2019s \u00a365m ($86m) bid but now face losing Guehi for free at the end of the season unless he signs a new deal.\n6. Alejandro Garnacho\nHaving moved on Marcus Rasfhord to Barcelona last week, Manchester United remain keen to offload another number of players who are not in Ruben Amorim\u2019s team.\nAlejandro Garnacho is one of them. Like Rashford, the Argentine was told to train away from the first team squad when he returned to Manchester earlier this summer.\nChelsea remain interested in the 21-year-old, who scored 10 goals in 58 appearances in all competitions last season and Napoli were linked with the Argentine in January.\nAmorim, however, has also suggested Garnacho may have a future at United if the club\u2019s financial demands were not met.\n\u201cIf they [suitors] don\u2019t reach that number, they will be Manchester United players, no doubts about that,\u201d the Portuguese said earlier this month.\n7. Jadon Sancho\nLike Garnacho, Sancho is also on the departure list at Old Trafford and he has also been told to train away from the first team squad.\nBut while the Argentine should have suitors, finding a buyer for Sancho may be more problematic and not just because he will be a free agent at the end of the season - United have the option to extend his \u00a3250,000-a-week ($340,000) deal for another 12 months, but they are highly unlikely to do so.\nChelsea signed the 25-year-old on a temporary transfer last summer with an obligation to buy worth up to \u00a325m ($33.7m), but in June opted to pay a \u00a35m ($6.7m) penalty charge to pull out of the deal.\nConsidered one of European soccer\u2019s outstanding talents when he joined United from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2021 for \u00a385m ($115m), Sancho never reached the same heights at Old Trafford, scoring a combined 12 goals in all competitions in two seasons despite starting 56 of his 79 appearances.\nHe was loaned back to Dortmund in the summer of 2023 after he publicly fell out with Erik ten Hag, who had questioned his commitment, and has failed to earn Ruben Amorim\u2019s trust too.\n8. Lucas Paqueta\nLucas Paqueta looks set to be cleared of any wrongdoing following a two-year probe on his alleged involvement in spot-fixing.\nWhen the allegations first surfaced, the Brazilian was on the verge of an \u00a385m ($113m) move to Manchester City, which subsequently collapsed.\nThe Hammers are now reportedly keen to cash in again, but their prospects of commanding a fee in that region are remote.\nAt the same time, Paqueta is still only 27 and should attract suitors from England and abroad.\n9. Darwin Nunez\nLiverpool\u2019s spending would rocket past the \u00a3400m ($530m) mark were they to land Alexander Isak before the end of the transfer window.\nSigning the Swede would also leave Arne Slot with a surplus of forwards, a scenario which would leave Darwin Nunez as the obvious candidate to be moved on.\nThe Uruguay international is a cult hero at Anfield but has never quite lived up to the \u00a373.5m ($97.2m) fee Liverpool paid for him three years ago.\nNunez started just 17 of his 47 appearances in all competitions last season and has attracted interest from Saudi Pro League outfit Al Ahli, Serie A champions Napoli and Juventus.\nAs is the case for Grealish, Nunez will be desperate to play regularly with a World Cup on the horizon.\n10. Christopher Nkunku\nChelsea have been busy in the transfer window again and must now make room for some of their new signings, with Christopher Nkunku headlining the list of potential departures.\nThe Blues valued the 27-year-old at \u00a365m ($86m) back in January, but according to The Athletic the figure has been drastically cut to \u00a343m ($57m).\nThe France international started just a third of his 27 Premier League appearances last season and he has attracted interest from Premier League clubs as well as in Serie A and the Bundesliga."

      "text": "The first north London derby of the season is still three months away, but Arsenal have already got one over Tottenham Hotspur this season.\nOn Wednesday, the Gunners agreed terms to sign Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace for \u00a367.5m ($90.6m), nabbing from under the nose of their arch-rivals in the process.\nTottenham had reached a deal to sign the 27-year-old for the same fee last weekend, just days after Eze\u2019s \u00a368m release clause had expired.\nBut just as the England international looked poised to join Spurs, Arsenal hijacked the move and convinced him to return to the club he had left at 13.\nEze\u2019s arrival may not be met by the level of hysteria that welcomed the signing of Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid back in 2013, when Arsenal fans celebrated in the streets around the Emirates Stadium as though the club had just won a trophy.\nAnd yet, this signing feels a landmark moment for the Gunners.\nEze has already been immortalized in a mural on a wall close to the Emirates and the manner in which Arsenal gazumped Tottenham to seal the deal is the latest addition to the rich tapestry that is the rivalry between the two clubs.\nBut there is more to this than just bragging rights.\nArsenal were distinctly pedestrian in their 1-0 win against Manchester United in their Premier League opener on Sunday, with new signing Viktor Gyokeres still looking out of sync with the rest of team after his $86m move from Sporting Club.\nGyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 matches in all competitions last season in Portugal and was brought in to provide an upgrade on Kai Havertz, who was Arsenal\u2019s top scorer in the Premier League despite scoring just nine goals.\nThe German played only 30 minutes on Sunday and suffered a knee injury that Arsenal fear may keep him sidelined for a lengthy period of time.\nIn January, Mikel Arteta decided against signing another forward as a back-up for Havertz, who suffered a hamstring injury a month later and missed 18 matches as a result.\nWith Gabriel Jesus sidelined with a serious knee injury, Arteta had to deploy midfielder Mikel Merino as emergency striker.\nThis time Arsenal acted swiftly and signed Eze, who is expected to take some of the pressure off Gyokeres, while the Swede finds his feet in his first campaign in the Premier League.\nWhere will Eberechi Eze fit in at Arsenal?\nEze scored 14 goals and recorded 12 assists in all competitions last season for Palace, after netting 11 and 10 goals in the previous two Premier League campaigns.\nHe is also one of the last mavericks in football, a player who cannot be constrained by a tactical straightjacket.\n\u201cWhy do I run with the ball? Why do I try things? Why am I creative? Why do I do things that maybe players wouldn\u2019t think to do?,\" Eze told BBC Sport before the FA Cup final in May.\n\u201cThe reason is for the people who are watching.\n\"It\u2019s what you\u2019re doing to people in the stands and how you can get people off their feet; that\u2019s what football\u2019s about.\n\"It feels like football is starting to shift a bit, and there\u2019s maybe not as much of that, but as long as I play, that\u2019s all I want to do.\u201d\nWhile that will be music to the ears of Arsenal fans, it also helps explain why Arteta wanted to sign him.\nEze\u2019s arrival adds a whole new dimension to Arsenal\u2019s attack, which has often struggled to unlock teams that have been happy to sit deep in a low block.\nAssuming Martin Odegaard will retain his No10 spot and Bukayo Saka will continue as the first-choice right winger, Eze should make the left wing spot his own and represents an upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli.\nBut he could also operate centrally and even just off Gyokeres, should Arteta opt for a formation with two strikers up top.\nIn many ways, Eze feels a throwback Arsenal player, the kind of footballer blessed with supreme technique and control in tight spaces, rather than the more imposing figures like Declan Rice and Merino that Arteta has recruited.\nCan Mikel Arteta deliver trophies?\nThe Arsenal manager has spent at least \u00a380m ($107m) in each of his five full seasons in charge at the Emirates.\nAside from Gyokeres and Eze, the Gunners signed Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad for \u00a360m ($81m), while Noni Madueke and Kepa Arrizabalaga joined from Chelsea for \u00a348m ($65m) and \u00a35m ($6.8m) respectively.\nMeanwhile, Christian Norgaard and Cristhian Mosquera arrived from Brentford and Valencia for a combined \u00a323.7m ($31.2m).\nOnce Eze\u2019s arrival is confirmed, the Gunners\u2019 total spending this summer could exceed \u00a3270m ($365m) if all the potential add-ons are triggered, comfortably surpassing the \u00a3199.3m ($269.4m) they spent two seasons ago.\nIn the past five years, only Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea have spent more on transfers than Arsenal, who still only have one FA Cup to show for their financial largesse.\nIn the same period, City and Chelsea have both won the Champions League, with the former also lifting the Premier League four times along with the FA Cup and the League Cup and the Blues adding the Europa Conference League and the inaugural Club World Cup.\nEven United, who are in the midst of one of their worst run in history, have won the League Cup and FA Cup.\nArsenal, meanwhile, have finished second in the Premier League for the past three seasons as their wait for a league title stretches into a 21st season.\nThe Gunners squandered an eight-point lead over City in the 2022-23 campaign and racked up 89 points the following term, the third-most by second-placed team in the history of the Premier League.\nThe big prize, however, has remained frustratingly elusive.\n\u201cFor three seasons we\u2019ve had more points than any other team in this league, which is incredible,\u201d Arteta said last week.\n\"That's how you have all the consistency.\n\"Now we have to do it in a season to have one more point or the same amount of points and more goals different than any other team. That's the objective.\"\nCity have actually won the most points over the past three seasons, racking up 251 points to Arsenal\u2019s 247, but Arteta\u2019s claim spoke volumes for his desire to deliver a first league title in two decades.\nEze could be crucial in turning that dream into reality and in that context the parallels with Ian Wright are impossible to ignore.\nLike Eze, Wright was 27 when he joined Arsenal from Crystal Palace in 1991.\nThe season before departing for north London, he dragged the Eagles to the FA Cup final, scoring against Manchester United, before Palace eventually lost the replay.\nIn May, Eze scored the winner at Wembley as Palace beat Manchester City to win their first ever trophy.\nIn seven seasons with Arsenal, Wright scored 185 goals in 288 appearances in all competitions, winning six major trophies including the Premier League title in 1998.\nCan Eze replicate Wright\u2019s impact at the Emirates? Arteta\u2019s quest for glory may well depend on it."
