  "content": "A number of stocks fell in the afternoon session after the major indices continued to pull back, with technology stocks accounting for most of the market's largest decliners. A key reason for this trend is that much of the recent market gains were concentrated in the \"AI trade,\" which includes these large technology and semiconductor companies. So this could also mean that some investors are locking in some gains ahead of more definitive feedback from the Fed.\n\nDespite the downturn, some analysts viewed this as an opportunity to own some of the \"Core AI winners.\" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities commented, \"In our view, the tech bull cycle will be well intact for at least another 2-3 years, given the trillions being spent on AI infrastructure/software/chips/power/apps looking ahead. This remains our tech playbook and investor roadmap.\" Additionally, mixed earnings reports from retailers, such as Target, have added to the market's weakness. Investors are closely monitoring these reports for insights into the broader economic health and the potential impact of new tariffs on inflation.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\u2022 Wireless, Cable and Satellite company Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) fell 3.7%.

In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 3.2% on the news that markets continued to rally amid growing speculation of an impending interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Following a favorable Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, investors are increasingly betting on a rate reduction next month, a sentiment amplified by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's call for a significant cut. This has fueled a 'risk-on' environment across Wall Street. Lower interest rates are typically beneficial for growth-oriented sectors like healthcare, as they reduce the cost of borrowing for research and innovation and increase the present value of future earnings.",

      "text": "Rogers (ROG)\nRogers keeps us up at night. Its low returns on capital and plummeting sales suggest it struggles to generate demand and profits, a red flag.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Rogers Will Underperform\nWith roots dating back to 1832, making it one of America's oldest continuously operating companies, Rogers (NYSE:ROG) designs and manufactures specialized engineered materials and components used in electric vehicles, telecommunications, renewable energy, and other high-performance applications.\n- Sales were flat over the last five years, indicating it\u2019s failed to expand this cycle\n- Sales over the last five years were less profitable as its earnings per share fell by 15.3% annually while its revenue was flat\n- ROIC of 6.2% reflects management\u2019s challenges in identifying attractive investment opportunities, and its decreasing returns suggest its historical profit centers are aging\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Rogers\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Rogers\nRogers is trading at $76.53 per share, or 27.3x forward P/E. This multiple is higher than that of business services peers; it\u2019s also rich for the top-line growth of the company. Not a great combination.\nWe\u2019d rather invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with more reliable earnings growth.\n3. Rogers (ROG) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nEngineered materials manufacturer Rogers (NYSE:ROG) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales fell by 5.3% year on year to $202.8 million. Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was better than expected at $207.5 million at the midpoint, 0.9% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.34 per share was 32% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nRogers (ROG) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $202.8 million vs analyst estimates of $198.8 million (5.3% year-on-year decline, 2% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.34 vs analyst expectations of $0.50 (32% miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $23.9 million vs analyst estimates of $25 million (11.8% margin, 4.4% miss)\n- Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $207.5 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $205.7 million\n- Adjusted EPS guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $0.70 at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $0.84\n- Operating Margin: -33.3%, down from 5.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 2.8%, down from 4.1% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.23 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith roots dating back to 1832, making it one of America's oldest continuously operating companies, Rogers (NYSE:ROG) designs and manufactures specialized engineered materials and components used in electric vehicles, telecommunications, renewable energy, and other high-performance applications.\nRogers operates through two main business segments: Advanced Electronics Solutions (AES) and Elastomeric Material Solutions (EMS). The AES segment produces circuit materials, ceramic substrates, and cooling solutions critical for applications where reliability is paramount. These materials serve as the foundation for components in electric vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems, radar systems, and telecommunications infrastructure.\nThe EMS segment focuses on engineered material solutions including polyurethane and silicone materials that provide cushioning, sealing, vibration management, and thermal regulation. These materials are found in everything from electric vehicle battery systems to portable electronics and medical devices.\nFor example, when an automotive manufacturer designs a new electric vehicle, they might use Rogers' circuit materials in the power management systems, their thermal solutions to keep batteries at optimal temperatures, and their elastomeric materials to reduce vibration and noise in the passenger compartment.\nRogers generates revenue by selling its materials and components to approximately 3,200 customers worldwide, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and component suppliers. The company employs a technical sales approach, working collaboratively with customers to design and develop materials that meet specific performance requirements.\nInnovation is central to Rogers' strategy, with research and development centers in Massachusetts, Arizona, Germany, and China. These innovation centers focus on developing new high-tech materials that align with emerging market needs, particularly in growth areas like electric vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems, and renewable energy, which collectively account for over half of the company's sales.\nRogers maintains manufacturing facilities across the United States, Europe, and Asia, allowing it to serve global customers with localized support. The company also operates through joint ventures in Japan and China to better serve Asian markets.\n4. Electronic Components & Manufacturing\nThe sector could see higher demand as the prevalence of advanced electronics increases in industries such as automotive, healthcare, aerospace, and computing. The high-performance components and contract manufacturing expertise required for autonomous vehicles and cloud computing datacenters, for instance, will benefit companies in the space. However, headwinds include geopolitical risks, particularly U.S.-China trade tensions that could disrupt component sourcing and production as the Trump administration takes an increasingly antagonizing stance on foreign relations. Additionally, stringent environmental regulations on e-waste and emissions could force the industry to pivot in potentially costly ways.\nRogers competes with other specialty materials manufacturers such as DuPont (NYSE:DD), 3M (NYSE:MMM), Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL), and Victrex plc (LON:VCT), as well as with more specialized private companies in specific product categories.\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years.\nWith $795.8 million in revenue over the past 12 months, Rogers is a small player in the business services space, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and numerous distribution channels.\nAs you can see below, Rogers struggled to increase demand as its $795.8 million of sales for the trailing 12 months was close to its revenue five years ago. This shows demand was soft, a tough starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Rogers\u2019s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 8.3% annually over the last two years.\nThis quarter, Rogers\u2019s revenue fell by 5.3% year on year to $202.8 million but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2%. Company management is currently guiding for a 1.3% year-on-year decline in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 2.4% over the next 12 months. While this projection suggests its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n6. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nRogers was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 7.1% was weak for a business services business.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Rogers\u2019s operating margin decreased by 21.2 percentage points over the last five years. Rogers\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nThis quarter, Rogers generated an operating margin profit margin of negative 33.3%, down 39.2 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nSadly for Rogers, its EPS declined by 15.3% annually over the last five years while its revenue was flat. This tells us the company struggled because its fixed cost base made it difficult to adjust to choppy demand.\nWe can take a deeper look into Rogers\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Rogers\u2019s operating margin declined by 21.2 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\nFor Rogers, its two-year annual EPS declines of 40.1% show it\u2019s continued to underperform. These results were bad no matter how you slice the data.\nIn Q2, Rogers reported adjusted EPS at $0.34, down from $0.69 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Rogers\u2019s full-year EPS of $2.05 to grow 37.3%.\n8. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nRogers has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 6.9% over the last five years, slightly better than the broader business services sector.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Rogers\u2019s margin dropped by 8.7 percentage points during that time. Continued declines could signal it is in the middle of an investment cycle.\nRogers\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $5.6 million in Q2, equivalent to a 2.8% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 1.3 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, suggesting its historical struggles have dragged on.\n9. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nRogers historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 4.8%, lower than the typical cost of capital (how much it costs to raise money) for business services companies.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Rogers\u2019s ROIC has unfortunately decreased significantly. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n10. Balance Sheet Assessment\nOne of the best ways to mitigate bankruptcy risk is to hold more cash than debt.\nRogers is a well-capitalized company with $157.2 million of cash and $23.7 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $133.5 million net cash position is 10.9% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n11. Key Takeaways from Rogers\u2019s Q2 Results\nIt was encouraging to see Rogers beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its revenue guidance for next quarter slightly exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates. On the other hand, its EPS guidance for next quarter missed and its EPS fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 2.7% to $63.80 immediately following the results.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy Rogers?\nUpdated: August 19, 2025 at 11:24 PM EDT\nWhen considering an investment in Rogers, investors should account for its valuation and business qualities as well as what\u2019s happened in the latest quarter.\nRogers doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. For starters, its revenue growth was weak over the last five years. And while its projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its declining EPS over the last five years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets. On top of that, its declining operating margin shows the business has become less efficient.\nRogers\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 27.3x. This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - we think other companies feature superior fundamentals at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $80 on the company (compared to the current share price of $76.53)."

      "text": "Tandem Diabetes (TNDM)\nWe wouldn\u2019t buy Tandem Diabetes. Its negative returns on capital suggest it eroded shareholder value by squandering business opportunities.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Tandem Diabetes Will Underperform\nWith technology that automatically adjusts insulin delivery based on continuous glucose monitoring data, Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ:TNDM) develops and manufactures automated insulin delivery systems that help people with diabetes manage their blood glucose levels.\n- Performance over the past five years shows its incremental sales were much less profitable, as its earnings per share fell by 21% annually\n- Push for growth has led to negative returns on capital, signaling value destruction\n- Unfavorable liquidity position could lead to additional equity financing that dilutes shareholders\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Tandem Diabetes\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Tandem Diabetes\nAt $10.89 per share, Tandem Diabetes trades at 13.6x forward EV-to-EBITDA. This multiple is quite expensive for the quality you get.\nPaying up for elite businesses with strong earnings potential is better than investing in lower-quality companies with shaky fundamentals. That\u2019s how you avoid big downside over the long term.\n3. Tandem Diabetes (TNDM) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nDiabetes technology company Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ:TNDM) reported Q2 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 8.5% year on year to $240.7 million. The company expects the full year\u2019s revenue to be around $1 billion, close to analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP loss of $0.78 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nTandem Diabetes (TNDM) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $240.7 million vs analyst estimates of $237.1 million (8.5% year-on-year growth, 1.5% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): -$0.78 vs analyst estimates of -$0.39 (significant miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: -$1.85 million vs analyst estimates of $2.34 million (-0.8% margin, significant miss)\n- The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $1 billion at the midpoint\n- Operating Margin: -21.5%, down from -13.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Sales Volumes rose 5% year on year, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.01 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith technology that automatically adjusts insulin delivery based on continuous glucose monitoring data, Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ:TNDM) develops and manufactures automated insulin delivery systems that help people with diabetes manage their blood glucose levels.\nTandem's flagship products include the t:slim X2 insulin pump and the newer, smaller Tandem Mobi system. Both devices feature the company's Control-IQ technology, an advanced hybrid closed-loop system that automatically adjusts insulin delivery based on readings from compatible continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). This technology helps users maintain their blood glucose within target ranges by increasing, decreasing, or suspending insulin delivery as needed, and can even deliver automatic correction doses when glucose levels rise too high.\nThe company's pumps are designed with user experience in mind, featuring touchscreen interfaces, Bluetooth connectivity, and software that can be updated remotely through a personal computer. This allows users to access new features without replacing their hardware. For example, existing t:slim X2 users can update their pumps to integrate with newer CGM sensors as they become available.\nTandem's revenue comes primarily from selling insulin pumps and the disposable supplies needed to use them, including insulin cartridges and infusion sets that need to be replaced every few days. A patient might use a Tandem pump to manage their diabetes by wearing the device (about the size of a small smartphone for the t:slim X2 or a car key fob for the Mobi), which delivers insulin through a thin tube connected to an infusion set attached to their body.\nThe company has expanded its CGM integration partnerships to include both Dexcom and Abbott sensors, giving patients more options for customizing their diabetes management systems. Tandem also offers digital tools like the Tandem Source data management platform, which allows users and healthcare providers to visualize diabetes data and identify trends.\nBeyond its current product lineup, Tandem is developing new innovations including a tubeless patch pump option, extended-wear infusion sets, and enhancements to its Control-IQ algorithm. The company is also working to expand its addressable market by conducting clinical trials to support the use of its technology in people with type 2 diabetes who require intensive insulin therapy.\n4. Healthcare Technology for Patients\nThe consumer-focused healthcare technology sector leverages digital platforms to make healthcare more accessible and affordable, offering services like telemedicine and prescription discounts. Looking forward, growth is supported by increasing consumer comfort with telehealth and the demand for cost-saving tools amidst rising healthcare expenses. AI-powered diagnostics and personalized digital care also present significant opportunities. However, the sector faces headwinds from heightened competition as large technology and established healthcare companies expand their digital presence.\nTandem Diabetes Care competes with Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), which makes the tubeless Omnipod insulin delivery system, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), a medical device giant with a diabetes division that produces insulin pumps, and privately-held Ypsomed, a European medical technology company that manufactures insulin pumps and injection systems.\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $1.00 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Tandem Diabetes is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Thankfully, Tandem Diabetes\u2019s 19.5% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was impressive. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Tandem Diabetes\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 12.4% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand.\nTandem Diabetes also reports its number of pump shipments, which reached 21,000 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Tandem Diabetes\u2019s pump shipments averaged 2.9% year-on-year growth. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth, we can see the company benefited from price increases.\nThis quarter, Tandem Diabetes reported year-on-year revenue growth of 8.5%, and its $240.7 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.5%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.8% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection is underwhelming and suggests its products and services will see some demand headwinds.\n7. Adjusted Operating Margin\nTandem Diabetes\u2019s high expenses have contributed to an average adjusted operating margin of negative 7.9% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It\u2019s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Tandem Diabetes\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 15.6 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 1.6 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\nTandem Diabetes\u2019s adjusted operating margin was negative 13.2% this quarter.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nTandem Diabetes\u2019s earnings losses deepened over the last five years as its EPS dropped 34.2% annually. We tend to steer our readers away from companies with falling EPS, where diminishing earnings could imply changing secular trends and preferences. If the tide turns unexpectedly, Tandem Diabetes\u2019s low margin of safety could leave its stock price susceptible to large downswings.\nIn Q2, Tandem Diabetes reported EPS at negative $0.78, down from negative $0.47 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Tandem Diabetes to improve its earnings losses. Analysts forecast its full-year EPS of negative $3.09 will advance to negative $1.00.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nTandem Diabetes has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 1.5%, subpar for a healthcare business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Tandem Diabetes\u2019s margin dropped by 9.1 percentage points during that time. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its already low cash conversion. If the trend continues, it could signal it\u2019s in the middle of a big investment cycle.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nTandem Diabetes\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 19.7%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the healthcare sector.\n11. Balance Sheet Risk\nDebt is a tool that can boost company returns but presents risks if used irresponsibly. As long-term investors, we aim to avoid companies taking excessive advantage of this instrument because it could lead to insolvency.\nTandem Diabetes posted negative $267,000 of EBITDA over the last 12 months, and its $449 million of debt exceeds the $315.4 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble.\nWe implore our readers to tread carefully because credit agencies could downgrade Tandem Diabetes if its unprofitable ways continue, making incremental borrowing more expensive and restricting growth prospects. The company could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly. We hope Tandem Diabetes can improve its profitability and remain cautious until then.\n12. Key Takeaways from Tandem Diabetes\u2019s Q2 Results\nIt was encouraging to see Tandem Diabetes beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS missed and its sales volume fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 17% to $12 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Tandem Diabetes?\nUpdated: August 20, 2025 at 12:04 AM EDT\nWhen considering an investment in Tandem Diabetes, investors should account for its valuation and business qualities as well as what\u2019s happened in the latest quarter.\nTandem Diabetes falls short of our quality standards. Although its revenue growth was impressive over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities. On top of that, the company\u2019s declining EPS over the last five years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets.\nTandem Diabetes\u2019s EV-to-EBITDA ratio based on the next 12 months is 13.6x. This valuation tells us it\u2019s a bit of a market darling with a lot of good news priced in - you can find more timely opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $22.59 on the company (compared to the current share price of $10.89).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

Summary\nWhy We Think Sirius XM Will Underperform\nKnown for its commercial-free music channels, Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) is a broadcasting company that provides satellite radio and online radio services across North America.\n- Annual sales declines of 2.2% for the past two years show its products and services struggled to connect with the market\n- Earnings per share fell by 36.9% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew, showing its incremental sales were much less profitable\n- Sales are projected to be flat over the next 12 months and imply weak demand\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Sirius XM\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Sirius XM\nSirius XM\u2019s stock price of $22.84 implies a valuation ratio of 7.8x forward P/E. Sirius XM\u2019s valuation may seem like a bargain, but we think there are valid reasons why it\u2019s so cheap.\nWe\u2019d rather pay up for companies with elite fundamentals than get a bargain on weak ones. Cheap stocks can be value traps, and as their performance deteriorates, they will stay cheap or get even cheaper.\n3. Sirius XM (SIRI) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nSatellite radio and media company Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) met Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales fell by 1.8% year on year to $2.14 billion. The company\u2019s outlook for the full year was close to analysts\u2019 estimates with revenue guided to $8.5 billion at the midpoint. Its GAAP profit of $0.57 per share was 26.3% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nSirius XM (SIRI) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $2.14 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.13 billion (1.8% year-on-year decline, in line)\n- EPS (GAAP): $0.57 vs analyst expectations of $0.77 (26.3% miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $668 million vs analyst estimates of $661.5 million (31.2% margin, 1% beat)\n- The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $8.5 billion at the midpoint\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $2.6 billion at the midpoint, in line with analyst expectations\n- Operating Margin: 17.1%, down from 23.2% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 18.8%, up from 15.7% in the same quarter last year\n- Subscribers: 8.23 million\n- Market Capitalization: $7.75 billion\nCompany Overview\nKnown for its commercial-free music channels, Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) is a broadcasting company that provides satellite radio and online radio services across North America.\nFormed by the 2008 merger of Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, Sirius XM offers a diverse range of radio content with broader coverage than traditional AM/FM radio. This move addressed the demand for varied and accessible nationwide content, overcoming the constraints of conventional radio broadcasts that are confined by the reach of their local radio signals.\nSirius XM delivers an extensive lineup of music, sports, news, talk shows, and entertainment through satellite and online streaming. Sirius XM differentiates itself by offering premium, hard-to-find content, appealing to listeners seeking a superior radio experience.\nThe company's revenue model centers on subscription fees, augmented by advertising on some channels, along with equipment and service sales.\n4. Wireless, Cable and Satellite\nThe massive physical footprints of cell phone towers, fiber in the ground, or satellites in space make it challenging for companies in this industry to adjust to shifting consumer habits. Over the last decade-plus, consumers have \u2018cut the cord\u2019 to their landlines and traditional cable subscriptions in favor of wireless communications and streaming video. These trends do mean that more households need cell phone plans and high-speed internet. Companies that successfully serve customers can enjoy high retention rates and pricing power since the options for mobile and internet connectivity in any geography are usually limited.\nCompetitors in the radio broadcasting and media services sector include iHeartMedia (NASDAQ:IHRT), Cumulus Media (NASDAQ:CMLS), and Urban One (NASDAQ:UONE).\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Over the last five years, Sirius XM grew its sales at a weak 1.6% compounded annual growth rate. This fell short of our benchmarks and is a tough starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or trend. Sirius XM\u2019s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 2.2% annually.\nThis quarter, Sirius XM reported a rather uninspiring 1.8% year-on-year revenue decline to $2.14 billion of revenue, in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months. While this projection indicates its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n6. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nSirius XM\u2019s operating margin has shrunk over the last 12 months and averaged 2% over the last two years. The company\u2019s profitability was mediocre for a consumer discretionary business and shows it couldn\u2019t pass its higher operating expenses onto its customers.\nIn Q2, Sirius XM generated an operating margin profit margin of 17.1%, down 6.1 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nSadly for Sirius XM, its EPS declined by 38.1% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 1.6%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded due to non-fundamental factors such as interest expenses and taxes.\nIn Q2, Sirius XM reported EPS at $0.57, down from $0.81 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts forecast Sirius XM\u2019s full-year EPS of negative $6.77 will flip to positive $3.02.\n8. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nSirius XM has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 12.6% over the last two years, slightly better than the broader consumer discretionary sector.\nSirius XM\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $402 million in Q2, equivalent to a 18.8% margin. This result was good as its margin was 3.1 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends are more important.\nOver the next year, analysts predict Sirius XM\u2019s cash conversion will improve. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 11.6% for the last 12 months will increase to 15.4%, it options for capital deployment (investments, share buybacks, etc.).\n9. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nSirius XM\u2019s management team makes decent investment decisions and generates value for shareholders. Its five-year average ROIC was 16.3%, slightly better than typical consumer discretionary business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Sirius XM\u2019s ROIC has unfortunately decreased significantly. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities.\n10. Balance Sheet Assessment\nSirius XM reported $92 million of cash and $10.2 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $2.68 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Sirius XM\u2019s 3.8\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $242 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n11. Key Takeaways from Sirius XM\u2019s Q2 Results\nRevenue was in line and adjusted EBITDA beat slightly. Looking ahead, the company reiterated full-year revenue guidance and EBITDA guidance met expectations. Overall, this was a quarter without many surprises. The stock remained flat at $22.88 immediately after reporting.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy Sirius XM?\nUpdated: August 19, 2025 at 10:09 PM EDT\nA common mistake we notice when investors are deciding whether to buy a stock or not is that they simply look at the latest earnings results. Business quality and valuation matter more, so we urge you to understand these dynamics as well.\nWe cheer for all companies serving everyday consumers, but in the case of Sirius XM, we\u2019ll be cheering from the sidelines. For starters, its revenue growth was weak over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its number of core subscribers has disappointed. On top of that, its declining EPS over the last five years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets.\nSirius XM\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 7.8x. While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is huge given its shaky fundamentals. There are better investments elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $23.64 on the company (compared to the current share price of $22.84)."

Its low returns on capital and plummeting sales suggest it struggles to generate demand and profits, a red flag.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Altice Will Underperform\nBased in Long Island City, Altice USA (NYSE:ATUS) is a telecommunications company offering cable, internet, telephone, and television services across the United States.\n- Annual sales declines of 2.3% for the past five years show its products and services struggled to connect with the market\n- Performance over the past five years shows each sale was less profitable as its earnings per share dropped by 31.1% annually, worse than its revenue\n- Short cash runway increases the probability of a capital raise that dilutes existing shareholders\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Altice\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Altice\nAt $2.33 per share, Altice trades at 0.3x forward EV-to-EBITDA. We acknowledge that the current valuation is justified, but we\u2019re passing on this stock for the time being.\nIt\u2019s better to pay up for high-quality businesses with strong long-term earnings potential rather than buy lower-quality stocks because they appear cheap. These challenged businesses often don\u2019t re-rate, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. Altice (ATUS) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nTelecommunications and cable services provider Altice USA (NYSE:ATUS) met Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales fell by 4.2% year on year to $2.15 billion. Its GAAP loss of $0.21 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nAltice (ATUS) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $2.15 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.15 billion (4.2% year-on-year decline, in line)\n- EPS (GAAP): -$0.21 vs analyst estimates of -$0.01 (significant miss)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $803.8 million vs analyst estimates of $848.9 million (37.4% margin, 5.3% miss)\n- Operating Margin: 14.5%, down from 22.4% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was $28.45 million, up from -$40.93 million in the same quarter last year\n- Broadband Subscribers: 3.93 million, down 160,400 year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.12 billion\nCompany Overview\nBased in Long Island City, Altice USA (NYSE:ATUS) is a telecommunications company offering cable, internet, telephone, and television services across the United States.\nThe company was founded to become a comprehensive telecommunications provider. Its solutions address the need for dependable internet connectivity, varied entertainment choices, and effective communication, providing a unified solution for entertainment and communication needs.\nAltice USA's services encompass high-speed internet, cable television, voice telephony, and digital television offerings, catering to both residential and business clients. The company's revenue is primarily derived from subscription-based services, and its ability to deliver a full suite of services makes it appealing to customers seeking convenience and simplification.\n4. Wireless, Cable and Satellite\nThe massive physical footprints of cell phone towers, fiber in the ground, or satellites in space make it challenging for companies in this industry to adjust to shifting consumer habits. Over the last decade-plus, consumers have \u2018cut the cord\u2019 to their landlines and traditional cable subscriptions in favor of wireless communications and streaming video. These trends do mean that more households need cell phone plans and high-speed internet. Companies that successfully serve customers can enjoy high retention rates and pricing power since the options for mobile and internet connectivity in any geography are usually limited.\nCompetitors in the telecommunications and media services sector include Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR), and DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH).\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Altice struggled to consistently generate demand over the last five years as its sales dropped at a 2.3% annual rate. This wasn\u2019t a great result and suggests it\u2019s a low quality business.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or trend. Altice\u2019s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 3.4% annually over the last two years.\nAltice also discloses its number of broadband subscribers and pay tv subscribers, which clocked in at 3.93 million and 1.74 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Altice\u2019s broadband subscribers averaged 3.4% year-on-year declines while its pay tv subscribers averaged 12.6% year-on-year declines.\nThis quarter, Altice reported a rather uninspiring 4.2% year-on-year revenue decline to $2.15 billion of revenue, in line with Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 3.2% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection is underwhelming and suggests its newer products and services will not lead to better top-line performance yet.\n6. Operating Margin\nAltice\u2019s operating margin has shrunk over the last 12 months, but it still averaged 17.5% over the last two years, top-notch for a consumer discretionary business. This shows it\u2019s an efficient company that manages its expenses effectively.\nIn Q2, Altice generated an operating margin profit margin of 14.5%, down 7.9 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nSadly for Altice, its EPS declined by 31.1% annually over the last five years, more than its revenue. This tells us the company struggled because its fixed cost base made it difficult to adjust to shrinking demand.\nIn Q2, Altice reported EPS at negative $0.21, down from $0.03 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts forecast Altice\u2019s full-year EPS of negative $0.58 will reach break even.\n8. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nAltice has shown poor cash profitability over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 1.9%, lousy for a consumer discretionary business. The divergence from its good operating margin stems from its capital-intensive business model, which requires Altice to make large cash investments in working capital and capital expenditures.\nAltice\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $28.45 million in Q2, equivalent to a 1.3% margin. Its cash flow turned positive after being negative in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, leading to temporary swings. Long-term trends trump fluctuations.\n9. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAltice historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 7.3%, somewhat low compared to the best consumer discretionary companies that consistently pump out 25%+.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Altice\u2019s ROIC averaged 2.2 percentage point decreases over the last few years. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n10. Balance Sheet Risk\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nAltice burned through $13.45 million of cash over the last year, and its $25.32 billion of debt exceeds the $247 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble.\nUnless the Altice\u2019s fundamentals change quickly, it might find itself in a position where it must raise capital from investors to continue operating. Whether that would be favorable is unclear because dilution is a headwind for shareholder returns.\nWe remain cautious of Altice until it generates consistent free cash flow or any of its announced financing plans materialize on its balance sheet.\n11. Key Takeaways from Altice\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe struggled to find many positives in these results. Its EPS missed and its EBITDA fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 10.5% to $2.13 immediately following the results.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy Altice?\nUpdated: August 19, 2025 at 10:58 PM EDT\nWe think that the latest earnings result is only one piece of the bigger puzzle. If you\u2019re deciding whether to own Altice, you should also grasp the company\u2019s longer-term business quality and valuation.\nAltice falls short of our quality standards. To kick things off, its revenue has declined over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its number of broadband subscribers has disappointed. On top of that, its declining EPS over the last five years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets.\nAltice\u2019s EV-to-EBITDA ratio based on the next 12 months is 0.3x. This valuation is reasonable, but the company\u2019s shaky fundamentals present too much downside risk. There are better investments elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $2.78 on the company (compared to the current share price of $2.33).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

Revenue guidance for the full year exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates, but next quarter\u2019s guidance of $161.5 million was less impressive, coming in 0.6% below expectations.

The Sactionals' design is user-friendly, allowing for easy assembly, reconfiguration, and expansion.\nLovasac products are quite expensive: its beanbags can cost $800 and some Sactionals are upwards of $10,000. As such, the company's products appeal to customers who like experimenting with their furniture and are willing to pay up for home decor.\n4. Home Furnishings\nA healthy housing market is good for furniture demand as more consumers are buying, renting, moving, and renovating. On the other hand, periods of economic weakness or high interest rates discourage home sales and can squelch demand. In addition, home furnishing companies must contend with shifting consumer preferences such as the growing propensity to buy goods online, including big things like mattresses and sofas that were once thought to be immune from e-commerce competition.\nLovesac\u2019s primary competitors include La-Z-Boy (NYSE:LZB), Wayfair (NYSE:W), West Elm (owned by Williams-Sonoma NYSE:WSM), and private companies IKEA and Ashley Furniture\n5. Sales Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, Lovesac\u2019s 22.7% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was impressive. Its growth beat the average consumer discretionary company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends and consumer preferences. Lovesac\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed significantly as its annualized revenue growth of 1.7% over the last two years was well below its five-year trend.\nThis quarter, Lovesac reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 4.3% but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 0.7%. Company management is currently guiding for a 3.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 6% over the next 12 months. Although this projection indicates its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector.\n6. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nLovesac\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly over the last 12 months but has generally stayed the same, averaging 2.5% over the last two years. This profitability was lousy for a consumer discretionary business and caused by its suboptimal cost structure.\nIn Q1, Lovesac generated an operating margin profit margin of negative 10.8%, up 2.7 percentage points year on year. This increase was a welcome development and shows it was more efficient.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nLovesac\u2019s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is encouraging and shows it\u2019s at a critical moment in its life.\nIn Q1, Lovesac reported EPS at negative $0.73, up from negative $0.83 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 6.9%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Lovesac\u2019s full-year EPS of $0.70 to grow 25.7%.\n8. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nLovesac broke even from a free cash flow perspective over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders.\nLovesac burned through $49.95 million of cash in Q1, equivalent to a negative 36.1% margin. The company\u2019s cash burn increased from $14.31 million of lost cash in the same quarter last year.\n9. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlthough Lovesac hasn\u2019t been the highest-quality company lately, it found a few growth initiatives in the past that worked out wonderfully. Its five-year average ROIC was 28.1%, splendid for a consumer discretionary business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Lovesac\u2019s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities.\n10. Balance Sheet Assessment\nLovesac reported $26.9 million of cash and $191.6 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $49.6 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Lovesac\u2019s 3.3\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $2.72 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n11. Key Takeaways from Lovesac\u2019s Q1 Results\nWe were impressed by Lovesac\u2019s optimistic EBITDA guidance for next quarter, which blew past analysts\u2019 expectations. We were also glad its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates.Overall, we think this was still a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 1.7% to $17.10 immediately following the results.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy Lovesac?\nUpdated: August 19, 2025 at 10:44 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Lovesac.\nLovesac isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it isn\u2019t one of our picks. Although its revenue growth was impressive over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its low free cash flow margins give it little breathing room. And while the company\u2019s stellar ROIC suggests it has been a well-run company historically, the downside is its operating margins reveal poor profitability compared to other consumer discretionary companies.\nLovesac\u2019s EV-to-EBITDA ratio based on the next 12 months is 5.7x. This valuation multiple is fair, but we don\u2019t have much faith in the company. We're fairly confident there are better investments elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $30.17 on the company (compared to the current share price of $19.10).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

Analysts warn that many highlighted stocks\u2014Sirius XM, Lovesac, Rogers, Tandem Diabetes, and Altice\u2014show weak growth, declining profitability, or high debt, making them unattractive for long\u2011term investors. The article highlights that despite short\u2011term price drops, the fundamentals of these companies suggest caution, with analysts recommending better alternatives elsewhere. Overall, the market\u2019s pullback is seen as a chance to reassess value in the face of uncertain Fed policy and uneven sector performance.",
