  "title": "AirPods Max in 2025? Same drawbacks, now ready for pros, and one killer feature",
  "description": "Apple gave AirPods Max a key 2025 software upgrade that filled one of the product's biggest gaps.",
  "content": "\u2022 The ability to switch quickly and seamlessly across an unlimited number of Apple devices is still the best feature of the AirPods Max.\n\u2022 The low-latency upgrade in iOS 18.4 makes the AirPods Max a lot more viable for professional multimedia producers (and gamers) when using a wired connection.\n\u2022 Comfort, battery life, and audio quality match high-end competitors from Sony, Bose, and others.\n\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nEven with their imperfections and elevated price tag ($549), I have to admit that the AirPods Max are a product that I love to use every day. What they do best -- pairing quickly and working seamlessly across my phone, laptop, desktop, and tablet -- is the thing that makes me prefer the AirPods Max to all other over-the-ear headphones.\n\nBut one of the things you couldn't traditionally do with the AirPods Max was use them for professional audio and video production, because of the latency issues with Bluetooth and the lack of an effective wired option. Apple fixed that in the spring of 2025 with the release of iOS 18.4, which brought a key software upgrade to the 2024 USB-C model of AirPods Max.\n\nWhile the 2024 relaunch of AirPods Max was relatively disappointing since it only brought new USB-C connectivity and new color options, the spring 2025 software update for Apple's over-the-ear headphones brought long-awaited professional upgrades that landed in iOS 18.4, as well as iPadOS 18.4 and MacOS Sequoia 15.4.\n\nThe new software drop gave AirPods Max 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio. The official line on this is that it preserves more details from the original studio recordings, and Apple reports that Apple Music has over 100 million songs in lossless audio. The reality is that the vast majority of people aren't going to be able to tell the difference between a regular song on Apple Music (or any other service) and the lossless version.\n\nAlso: How to figure out if you should (or shouldn't) buy the USB-C AirPods Max\n\nWhere this upgrade really made a difference was enabling ultra low-latency audio when connected via a USB-C cable. This opened the door to professional workflows with music production and video production so that technicians could have the kind of precision they need for studio work. It also allowed the pros to produce Personalized Spatial Audio in apps like Apple's Logic Pro and immediately preview it with AirPods Max.\n\nGamers also benefited from the ultra low-latency audio via USB-C cable to the AirPods Max because it reduced lag to near-zero to match the same experience you'd get on a Mac, iPad, or iPhone when playing sound through the built-in speakers.\n\nBefore the AirPods Max, I never found a pair of over-the-ear headphones that I could wear for more than about 45 minutes because they would hurt my ears. I can wear the AirPods Max for hours on long flights, which is one of my favorite uses. And their long battery life is another key on cross-country or international flights.\n\nThere are now several other over-the-ear headphones that are super comfortable and have great battery life, such as the Sony XM6 headphones and Bose QuiteComfort Ultra, which are both at the top of ZDNET's picks for best headphones. But pairing and sharing across as many devices as I use isn't great on headphones that aren't AirPods because it's usually limited to two devices.\n\nAlso: I wore the best headphones from Sony, Bose, Apple, and Sonos: Here's how the AirPods Max wins\n\nAt the end of the day, most of us turn to over-the-ear headphones for two things: noise cancellation and audio quality. For both of these, the AirPods Max are in the same league as the best headphones on the market, including the ones from Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, and others. I can hear details in music and movies using the AirPods Max that I simply can't hear with AirPods Pro or other earbuds. And when you pair the AirPods Max with an M4 iPad Pro that has a Tandem OLED screen, the quality of the audio and video experience you get feels like it could almost rival a high-quality digital movie theater.\n\nThere are still a couple things that I don't love about AirPods Max. The biggest one is the price. At $549, they are $100 more expensive than even the Sony XM6 headphones, which have feature parity with AirPods Max and the premium Sony brand. Most of the other premium headphones on the market are around $350.\n\nThe other issue is that Apple still hasn't integrated its latest H2 chip from the AirPods Pro 2 into the AirPods Max. The H2 chip, which has more advanced noise cancellation and voice isolation, was released in 2022 but was not integrated into the latest AirPods Max released in 2024. For Apple to not put its best audio technology into its highest end headphones -- especially at such a premium price -- is disappointing.\n\nThe AirPods Max are only worth the extra money for people who use a lot of different Apple devices on a regular basis. Otherwise, I'd recommend going with the Sony XM6 headphones -- or even the Sony XM5 version -- to save money and get virtually all the same features, including even lower latency than AirPods Max.",

With the new Liquid Glass approach to UI, Apple will offer users a more consistent design and experience across all its devices.\nThe iOS 26 developer seed is available now, but the iOS 26 public beta likely won't go live until mid-July. Betas give both developers and even average users a way to test the latest iteration of Apple's software. With the latest iOS 26 Beta 3, for instance, Apple has refined the Liquid Glass design and introduced several under-the-hood tweaks for iPhone.\nAlso: Your iPhone is getting a big upgrade. 10 best features I can't wait to use in iOS 26\nGiven that the public beta is expected to open soon, here is some guidance on which iPhone models support iOS 26.\nWhich iPhone models will get iOS 26?\nAccording to Apple, these iPhone models can get iOS 26 once it becomes widely available:\n- iPhone 16e\n- iPhone 16\n- iPhone 16 Plus\n- iPhone 16 Pro\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max\n- iPhone 15\n- iPhone 15 Plus\n- iPhone 15 Pro\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max\n- iPhone 14\n- iPhone 14 Plus\n- iPhone 14 Pro\n- iPhone 14 Pro Max\n- iPhone 13\n- iPhone 13 mini\n- iPhone 13 Pro\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max\n- iPhone 12\n- iPhone 12 mini\n- iPhone 12 Pro\n- iPhone 12 Pro Max\n- iPhone 11\n- iPhone 11 Pro\n- iPhone 11 Pro Max\n- iPhone SE (2nd generation or later)\nAlso: Will your old iPhone, Mac, or iPad run Apple's latest updates? Check this list\nNotably, the once-popular iPhone X, XS, XR, and XS Max models are not on the list.\niOS 26 beta vs general release: What's the difference?\nThe iOS 26 beta version differs slightly from the general release. The purpose of the beta phase is to gather feedback to repair bugs and address any user interface issues before the software is massively distributed.\nBeta versions can also be incomplete and are not the final product. This means the iOS 26 developer and public betas are more prone to bugs, glitches, and instability.\nAlso: Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found your perfect fit\nThe general release will have ironed out most of these bugs and problems using the user feedback gathered during the beta phase, delivering software that isn't as prone to issues. However, they can still happen.\nFor example, in the 2023 iOS 17 beta, Apple moved the in-call \"End\" button from its familiar center position to the right. After beta testers voiced frustration, Apple restored the button to the center before the public release.\nWhen will iOS 26 release?\nApple will launch iOS 26 in three phases: the developer beta, public beta, and finally, the official \"general\" release.\nDeveloper beta\nThe first developer beta of iOS 26 was released on June 9 during WWDC 2025. Following this, subsequent developer betas, including beta 3, were released.\nPublic beta\nThe public beta is expected to start in mid-July.\nApple typically opens its public beta program a few weeks after WWDC. For instance, last year's iOS 18 public beta went live in mid-July. This program lets anyone -- not just registered developers -- test early software, helping Apple identify and fix bugs or performance issues before the final release.\nGeneral release\nApple officially released iOS 18 out of beta on Sept. 16, just one week after its \"Glowtime\" event.\nLikewise, once iOS 26 completes its developer and public beta testing this summer, Apple is expected to roll out the final version to everyone this fall.\nWhat is a software beta?\nA software beta is an early preview of an application or operating system, released to a select group of developers or users to gather feedback and uncover bugs under real-world conditions. It follows an internal alpha phase and helps Apple address issues before an official \"general\" release.\nWhich iPhone models can't run iOS 26?\niOS 26 will not be supported on the iPhone XS, XR, XS Max, or earlier models.\nAlso: Every iPhone model that can be updated to iOS 26 (and which ones don't support it)\nWhat should you do with an old iPhone that can't run iOS 26?\nThe Apple brand is strong and holds significant resale value, so you can always sell your older iPhone and disclose that it's no longer supported for software updates. There's a lot of demand for older iPhones that are still functional and budget-friendly, but you can also trade them for credit toward a new device.\nApple, Best Buy, and Amazon are just some retailers that accept iPhone trade-ins. iPhones' resale and trade-in values depend heavily on their condition and storage capacity. Features like an intact screen and a working camera greatly influence resale or trade-in values.\nYou can check your iPhone's trade-in value at one of these retailers or at a telecommunications company's authorized dealer.\nEditor's note: This article was originally published in 2024.

      "text": "Your Apple Watch is getting a big upgrade for free - 8 WatchOS 26 features I'm using now\nYour iPhone, Apple Watch, and other Apple-owned devices are getting a big overhaul. The best part? You won't have to pay a dime for them -- just update your software.\nSeveral new features are coming to WatchOS 26, and the public beta software is now available for interested users to try now, if you don't want to wait until the official launch later this fall.\nReddit users in the r/Apple Watch subreddit are already digging into the latest update and commenting on their most and least favorite features. The features touch everything from Fitness to Messages, and include a major design update across Apple's platforms for a more unified look and naming mechanisms that reflect the year the software debuts.\nAlso: The best Apple Watch of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nIn addition to WatchOS updates, Apple also introduced AI feature developments, like Live Translation and on-screen Visual Intelligence, like Hold Assist for phone calls and Polls for Messages. If you want to try it out, make sure your Apple Watch supports WatchOS 26, and be sure to back up your device beforehand.\nHere are the features we've enjoyed using on WatchOS 26 now that the public beta is live.\n1. Liquid Glass design update\nYour Apple Watch interface, along with the rest of your Apple devices, is getting the Liquid Glass design treatment. Apple's \"broadest design update ever\" introduces a fluid and clear across-platform display overhaul inspired by VisionOS's visual interface. The idea is that the Liquid Glass reflects or refracts whatever is behind or in front of it to create a transparent, glassy look.\nPCMag: I visited a secret brain implant company and got a glimpse of our cyborg future\nThis will change how your Smart Stack, notifications, icons, and more appear. Icons on your watch's lock screen or app page will look clear instead of their current opaque appearance, reflecting the light on your wallpaper or on apps.\nPersonally, I love the way Liquid Glass appears on my Series 10 smartwatch and find the design innovative and futuristic.\n2. Apple Intelligence-infused Fitness\nThe next time you record a workout on the Fitness app, you'll have a personal fitness coach waiting for you. AI-powered Workout Buddy uses your fitness data history it gathers through the app to provide you with real-time insights during your workout.\nWorkout Buddy rapidly considers your fitness history, paces, Activity Rings, Training Load, and more to deliver feedback and encouragement ahead of, during, and after your exercise.\nAlso: I ran with the Apple Watch and Galaxy Watch - here's the better AI coach\nI tried out the feature on a few runs, and was delighted by how subtle (and not annoying!) the feature was. When Apple first announced it, I expected there would be a voice in my ear throughout my entire workout, but it only pings me during important moments of my workout, like when I've run another mile, or when my heart rate reaches a high zone.\nI can customize these features within the Workout app, which also got a little redesign itself. Each workout appears larger on the Apple Watch screen, so you can easily click on your workout of choice, set your Workout Buddy preferences, and customize the Workout View for only the most relevant information at a glance.\nAlso: I compared the best smartwatches from Samsung, Google, and Apple - here's how Galaxy Watch 8 wins\nIt's about time Apple debuts an AI health feature that incorporates personalized data insights. Other wearables, like Oura and Whoop have health coaches that create reports or customize activity recommendations based on a user's activity levels and behaviors. I'm excited to test out this feature and see how it compares to the competition.\nWorkouts are also getting a facelift with more customizable workout and race route features. Apple Watch users can also activate their Apple Music playlists in the Workout app by tapping the music note in the bottom corner. This enables the Autoplay feature, which automatically turns on your tunes once you begin your workout. I can see Spotify or Soundcloud adding support in the future.\n3. Smart Stack improvements\nSmart Stack's prediction algorithm is improving. It now includes more contextual data, like sensor and routine data, to hint at certain apps or functionalities. For example, a Functional Strength Training workout might pop up once you enter your gym in the morning, or the Backtrack hint might pop up once Apple Watch registers you're in a location with no cellular connectivity.\nThis feature is one of those simple but effective examples of Apple Watch learning your routine, monitoring how you use its technology, and implementing helpful suggestions just when you need it.\nAlso: I was on the fence with the Apple Watch 10, but these 3 features changed my mind\n4. Notifications\nApple Watch Notifications are getting, thankfully, self-aware. Instead of loudly pinging you in silent environments -- something that constantly happens to me in my quiet office -- the new feature interprets the ambient noise of your environment to adjust your notification volume while delivering a text or app update.\nI've been wearing the watch since updating to WatchOS 26 and I can say that this change has been so subtle that I haven't even noticed, but also, that might be the entire point.\n5. Live Translation\nApple Intelligence brings Live Translation to Messages in Apple Watch. The AI-powered feature translates conversations to a user's preferred language on their wrist.\nThe feature is available on Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2, and it currently supports English (US, UK), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Spain), and Chinese (simplified).\n6. Messages\nApple Watch will use the context clues from your Messages to suggest relevant actions, like sending a Check-In when a user is on their way home or an Apple Cash pop-up when a friend sends you the dinner bill. Apple also says that Smart Replies are getting even smarter with its on-device language model, which provides \"precise\" and \"relevant\" responses to conversations.\n7. Wrist Flick\nMove over, Double Tap. A new hand motion just dropped for the Apple Watch. Wrist Flick is designed for dismissing notifications and calls, or silence pings. All a user has to do is turn their wrist. I've used this a few times to dismiss messages I don't want to reply to or calls from random numbers, and it's worked easily.\n8. More updates across the board\nThe Notes app arrives on Apple Watch. As does Hold Assist and Call Screening, two new iOS feature that notify user to return to a call on a phone call hold and screen unknown numbers. Live Listen, an accessibility feature for those deaf or hard of hearing, provides live captions on your iPhone using audio that Apple Watch monitors.\nAlso: Every iPhone model you can update to iOS 26 (and which ones don't support it)\nThe Watch acts as a remote control to start or pause these conversations. Lastly, watch faces will be easier to customize with a redesigned watch face gallery, and photo faces use custom content to shuffle images on your watch screen.\nWhich Apple Watch models support WatchOS 26?\nYou'll need an iPhone 11 or later or iPhone SE in addition to following Apple Watches. Keep in mind that some Apple Intelligence-powered features, like Live Translation and Workout Buddy, require one of the following iPhone models: all iPhone 16 models, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Max with Apple Intelligence enabled.\n- Apple Watch Series 6\n- Apple Watch Series 7\n- Apple Watch Series 8\n- Apple Watch Series 9\n- Apple Watch Series 10\n- Apple Watch Ultra\n- Apple Watch Ultra 2\n- Apple Watch SE (2nd generation)"

From the way users interact with group chats to how they pay with their phones, the upcoming version of the iPhone software is all about streamlining daily experiences and giving existing users more reasons to stick to Apple's apps and services.\nI've broken down all the new features below, listed in no particular order, so you know what to expect, whether you're about to dive into the developer beta of iOS 26 or are waiting for the official version to come later this year.\n1. A glassier appearance with real-time physics\nThe big story with iOS 26 and all the other operating system updates announced at WWDC this year is the new Liquid Glass appearance. Inspired by the physicality of VisionOS, app icons, settings, and other various user interface elements now have a translucent, glass-like design.\nAlso: What is Liquid Glass? Here's everything we know about Apple's major UI overhaul at WWDC\n\"Experiences are more expressive and personal, from the Lock Screen and Home Screen, to new capabilities across Phone and Messages that help users focus on the connections that matter most,\" said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering.\nWith the optical quality of glass and the fluidity that Apple hardware can achieve, the new software design reacts to how you tap, swipe (with some interfaces minimizing or expanding), and even hold your phone. The colors of Liquid Glass react to the various colors on your screen.\nTo accommodate the design change, popular app icons like Messages, Phone, and Camera have received visual updates. More generally, toolbars and tabs have been redesigned into rounded menus instead of the usual drop-down lists. This promotes a less intrusive and distracting experience when navigating the software.\nLastly, building on the foundation of iOS 18's icon themes, Liquid Glass introduces a transparent icon finish.\n2. Lockscreen and homescreen changes\nThe lock screen now features a time and date widget made of Liquid Glass. App icons have also been designed to be easier to distinguish and more contrastive with the wallpaper underneath.\nA new dynamic lock screen widget changes the clock size as you change wallpapers, expanding itself if there's more unused real estate. Spatial scenes can also be generated from your lock screen wallpapers to create more depth and realism as you move your iPhone from side to side.\n3. Camera app gets a more simplified interface\nThe new camera app is getting a more streamlined design, with video and photo capturing toggles front and center. A swipe to the side reveals more unique shooting modes like spatial recording, while tapping on the settings at the top of the app reveals multiple toggles at once, such as FPS and resolution.\nAlso: Every iPhone model compatible with Apple's iOS 26 (and which ones aren't)\nRelatedly, the Photos app has been updated to feature separate tabs for Library and Collections.\n4. Messages app gets translations, polls, and more\nApple Intelligence will detect when a poll makes sense in a group chat thread and suggest one to help you make a decision. Users within the group can still modify the poll should they not be satisfied with what's been suggested.\nAnother feature that's new and desperately needed on iOS: Apple is introducing real-time text translation. The iPhone will automatically detect and translate incoming text messages in non-English languages, so that they appear in English when you view them.\nAlso: How to send and receive Apple's iMessages in Windows\nConversely, iOS 26 will also enable your iPhone to translate outbound messages into your desired language, a feature previously available only on competing platforms and services.\nGroup chats are finally getting text indicators, allowing you to see who is actively typing. Incoming text messages will also receive Apple Intelligence-powered screening, with spam and messages from unknown senders filtered out into a dedicated tab.\nLastly, you can set background photos in group chats or even generate one with Apple Intelligence.\n5. CarPlay gets a design overhaul\niOS 26's Liquid Glass theming is being converted into CarPlay, too, with light and dark mode options available. When users receive a phone call or text messages, they appear as smaller notifications on the dashboard to reduce distractions.\nYou can also now respond to text messages with Tapbacks or access pinned conversations for a more purposeful user interface.\nAlso: Your CarPlay is getting a major overhaul on iOS 26: 3 new features arriving to your dashboard\nLive Activities can also be displayed beside your Maps navigation, so you can stay up to date with flight timers, deliveries, and more.\nCarPlay Ultra will also receive this design overhaul, though the software remains limited to select premium models.\n6. Phone app gets spam-fighting powers\nThe Phone app is getting an Apple Intelligence makeover, with voicemail summaries appearing in the main screen, alongside the new unified layout -- your Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails will all appear on the same page now.\nAlso: Apple's secret sauce is exactly what AI is missing\nCall Screening automatically screens and responds to unknown calls. Once the caller responds, you can read their response and decide whether to pick up the call. While the feature has existed on Android devices for years now, we'll have to see if Apple's interpretation is any more reliable.\nThe new Hold Assist feature is essential when you've been put on hold by a live agent and want to be notified when they've returned to the call. Now, instead of leaving the usual elevator music on speaker, the iPhone will alert you when it's time to resume the call, so you don't have to wait on the line.\n7. Apple Maps will log where you've been (if you allow it)\nThe iPhone will now learn your preferred navigations and travel paths to prioritize those. If there are alternate routes available, you'll now receive a notification as you're driving. You can also enable your iPhone to track your visited locations. The information is end-to-end encrypted and can easily be removed with a swipe.\n8. Apple Wallet gives you more context when traveling\nApple Wallet is also becoming more capable across the board, from how you pay to how to access information about your purchases.\nFor example, you can now store a digital version of your passport, which doesn't necessarily replace your physical passport but will be helpful when you need to verify your age or identity at TSA checkpoints.\nAlso: How to use Apple Pay in stores and online (and why you should)\nOn your digital boarding pass, you'll also be able to tap into Maps for a 3D view of your terminal and airport floor plan.\nThe Apple Pay terminal now displays several ways to purchase a product, including installments and rewards points based on your credit card.\nWallet now uses merchant and delivery emails to summarize tracking details at a glance.\n9. A dedicated (and more competitive) Games app\nA new Apple Games app bundles all the titles available on your iPhone and through your Arcade subscription, providing quick access to various games. There's even a section dedicated to multiplayer games and leaderboards, allowing you to compete with your friends and contacts.\n10. Visual Intelligence expands to the iPhone screen\nPreviously, Visual Intelligence only functioned within the iPhone's camera viewfinder, providing searchable insights on what's being shown. On iOS 26, the multimodal AI tool will also work on your iPhone's screen, whether you're on a web page or social media post.\nAlso: One of Gemini's coolest features is now open to all Android and iOS users - for free\nHowever, this feature functions more as a screenshotting tool, as the phone must capture an image before it can process what's on screen. When it does, you can either type in a query or use the suggested action, like \"Add to calendar.\"\nWhich iPhone models will get iOS 26?\nAccording to Apple, these iPhone models can get iOS 26 once it becomes widely available:\n- iPhone 16e\n- iPhone 16\n- iPhone 16 Plus\n- iPhone 16 Pro\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max\n- iPhone 15\n- iPhone 15 Plus\n- iPhone 15 Pro\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max\n- iPhone 14\n- iPhone 14 Plus\n- iPhone 14 Pro\n- iPhone 14 Pro Max\n- iPhone 13\n- iPhone 13 mini\n- iPhone 13 Pro\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max\n- iPhone 12\n- iPhone 12 mini\n- iPhone 12 Pro\n- iPhone 12 Pro Max\n- iPhone 11\n- iPhone 11 Pro\n- iPhone 11 Pro Max\n- iPhone SE (2nd generation or later)"

But for an older dog in this fight, the AirPods Max are still kicking. Since their 2020 release (and 2024 re-release), the Max haven't received many significant software or hardware updates, aside from new colors, a USB-C port, and support for lossless audio via USB-C.\nAlso: The 12 best headphones of 2025\nSo, five years later, set on the backdrop of a potential successor this fall, are the AirPods Max still worth buying? After testing the best headphones on the market, here's my buying advice.\nThe good: design, device interoperability, and great sound\nOne thing is indisputable: the AirPods Max are a beautiful pair of headphones. They are simple, sleek, and often imitated -- yet never replicated. The stainless steel accents give it an elevated look, no logos or branding make them appear sophisticated, and the Digital Crown successfully replaces multiple buttons that can be confused with one another.\nAlso: Here's how a free software upgrade made the Sonos Ace worth their price tag\nIn the design category, the Sonos Ace are the Max's closest rival. They're also defined by clean lines, a simple design, metallic accents, and removable magnetic ear pads, but have thinner earcups and a lighter build. The Ace feature their own take on the Digital Crown with a similarly functioning Content Key, but placed in an easier-to-reach spot on the ear cup.\nBose's QuietComfort Ultra sport aluminum yokes for enhanced durability, but most of the headphone is made of plastic. Similarly, Sony's XM6 is built with mostly plastic -- albeit with materials that are highly sustainable.\nFor Apple users, the AirPods Max are the definitive over-ear headphones option, thanks to their automatic pairing with your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV. Jason Hiner, ZDNET's editor-in-chief, is an avid Apple user, and the AirPods Max are his premium headphones of choice. Aside from automatic device switching, Hiner's favorite thing about the Max is their noise cancellation and audio quality chops.\n\"For [noise cancellation and audio quality], the AirPods Max are in the same league as the best headphones on the market, including the ones from Sony, Bose, and Sennheiser. I can hear details in music and movies using the AirPods Max that I simply can't hear with AirPods Pro or other earbuds,\" he says.\nEven as they near their fifth birthday, the AirPods Max still sound incredible by today's standards. Apple's Personalized Spatial Audio works beautifully, creating a wider soundstage that doesn't sound too computerized. In the spatial audio department, the Sonos Ace and Beats Studio Pro are fierce competitors, providing a similar spatial listening experience.\nAlso: Why these headphones are still the best from Bose - even though they're a year old\nThe AirPods Max have great noise-canceling abilities, owing to their performance with eight microphones for active noise cancellation (ANC). The Sonos Ace perform just as well as the Max in canceling environmental noise, but Bose's QuietComfort Ultra and Sony's WH-1000XM6 are the kings of ANC.\nHowever, even five years later, the AirPods Max still have a leg up on all of their competitors' Transparency Modes. Apple's Transparency Mode is the clearest, most transparent, and most natural-sounding.\nThe mesh ear pads of the Apple headphones, while different from those of other brands, have also held up well. They're firm without being hard, providing a tight yet comfortable seal around your ears for immersion. The lack of polyurethane leather on the ear pads simultaneously adds to their expense and user experience.\nAlso: I replaced my Bose UltraComfort headphones for the Sony XM6 - here's how it went\nMy colleague, Kerry Wan, ZDNET's managing editor, says the Max's mesh ear pads are one of the best things about them. \"I've found the AirPods Max's mesh-style ear cushions to relieve pressure and sweat build-up better than the waxy, silicone-based covers found on competing headphones,\" he says.\nAnd I have to agree; the mesh pads feel better against my skin and manage heat buildup better. But with great power comes great responsibility. The mesh pads absorb sweat, oils, and odors instead of keeping them on the surface like the competitors' ear pads. Thus, you can either throw them in the wash every once in a while or spend the money to replace them.\nThe bad: Software, all things battery life, and an ode to comfort\nI still respect Apple's H1 audio processor, but it's clear that it can't keep up with the industry's more advanced software features. That's why AirPods Max users look longingly out the window when AirPods Pro 2 users get all of the cool software updates every September.\nZDNET's Jason Hiner loves many things about the AirPods Max, but he acknowledges their steep price tag and antiquated H1 audio chip are major pitfalls. Apple's H2 chip, found in the AirPods Pro 2, is the company's most advanced audio chip and offers users better audio quality, more stable connections, and stronger noise cancellation. The H2 chip's omission in the AirPods Max, even in the 2024 rereleased model, is a pain point for Hiner.\nAlso: Sony WH-1000XM6 vs. Bose QuietComfort Ultra: How to choose the best noise-canceling headphone\n\"For Apple to not put its latest audio technology into its highest-end headphones -- especially at such a premium price -- is disappointing,\" he says.\nThese days, adaptive noise cancellation is all the rage. Headphone processors are intelligent enough to listen to your environment's noise levels and employ the appropriate amount of noise cancellation. This feature can preserve battery life, help with situational awareness, and generally be more convenient than manually switching ANC modes.\nI often rag on the Bose QuietComfort Ultra's short 24-hour battery life, but Apple's is shorter at 20 hours. The AirPods Max have poor endurance compared to their competitors, with the Sonos Ace and Sony XM6 testing for around 30 hours with ANC on.\nMy advice is that you shouldn't buy the AirPods Max if you don't have at least one Apple product, and I often attribute that to paying for features you can't use, like Find My and Personalized Spatial Audio.\nAdditionally, without a companion app, software updates are wrapped into iOS updates, making it impossible to update your AirPods without an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. ZDNET's Kerry Wan is mainly an Android user, though he shamelessly admits to keeping an iPhone around to update the headphones and test the latest features. That's obviously not the case for most users.\nAlso: Five iOS 26 features I already can't live without - and how to access them\nAnother unsurprising caveat is that the AirPods Max are a hefty pair of headphones. They're heavier than all of their challengers, and their thin mesh headband doesn't act as enough of a counterweight for the heavy earcups when I wear them for long periods. The Sonos Ace and Bose QuietComfort Ultra have plushy earcups and sturdier headbands, and they're better suited for long-term wear when I travel or work at my desk.\nZDNET's buying advice\nAs the AirPods Max prepare to celebrate their fifth anniversary, it's impressive that they're still in the premium headphone conversation; that's a testament to their performance and future proofing. I have more good than bad things to say about them, but I don't think they're for everyone, not even for every Apple fan.\nIf you never stray from the iOS ecosystem and prioritize design, great sound, and good noise cancellation, the AirPods Max will serve you well. Just be sure to buy them on sale; it happens often.\nIf you value an AirPods Max-inspired design, comfort, sound, and full compatibility with iOS and Android, consider the Sonos Ace. If comfort and noise cancellation are at the top of your list, try the Bose QC Ultra. If impeccable sound, industry-leading noise cancellation are your must-haves, go with the Sony XM6.\nAnd if you want headphones with a simple, clean design that offers aspects of Apple's user interface and supports native Android features, the Beats Studio Pro are for you."

I always watch Apple's annual hardware events to keep tabs on the latest AirPods, and this year was bittersweet for me.\nI love the new AirPods 4 with noise cancellation because they're the perfect earbuds for people who want standard audio features without overpaying for the more advanced AirPods Pro 2. Ahead of the event, I was confident Apple would shock the world with the AirPods Max 2.\nAlso: 8 ways I'm preparing my iPhone for iOS 18 - and I recommend you do too\nApple didn't. Instead, the company announced the updated AirPods Max, with fresh, new colors and a USB-C port to replace the Lightning port, pushing it further into obsolescence. To some, these updates aren't compelling enough to spend $549 on headphones that aren't much different from the original ones released in 2020. To others, the updates are exactly what they needed to finally buy them.\nAs my colleague Kerry Wan said, \"The best of Apple products lie in the details.\" The details make the updated AirPods Max great and simultaneously not great enough for everyone; here's why.\nWired listening is much simpler\nIntroducing the USB-C port to the AirPods Max is the most notable of the two updates, and universal charging isn't the only more convenient thing. You can plug one end of your Apple USB-C cable into the Max headphones and the other end into your iPhone (if it's an iPhone 15 or later) and start listening.\nAlthough that simplicity is the norm for non-Apple headphones, the AirPods Max with Lightning make wired listening feel like a science experiment. Some people -- and by people, I mean me -- used a non-Apple Lighting-to-3.5mm adapter, a 3.5mm-to-2.5mm audio cable, and another Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter just for no audio to pass through.\nI then discovered I had to purchase Apple's $35 Lighting-to-3.5mm audio cable, since it's the only audio cable compatible with the headphones. Such a simple feature on your headphones shouldn't be this complicated, and with the USB-C AirPods Max, it's not.\nAlso: Curious about Apple's AirPods 4? Here are the differences between the new models\nThe ZDNET team hasn't tested the new AirPods Max's wired capabilities yet, but my guess is you can use any USB-C cable for wired listening. If you don't purchase Apple's USB-C cord, ensure you purchase an MFi Certified cable.\nZDNET's buying advice\nIf you have a perfectly functioning pair of Lightning-compatible AirPods Max, I don't recommend you buy the updated ones. There's no new audio chip or significant software upgrades, and an updated port doesn't warrant spending nearly $600. If, however, you've always wanted the AirPods Max and don't want to wait for the next generation, the new USB-C port is a decent upgrade for first-timers.\nApple products work best with other Apple products, so the AirPods Max offer unique interoperability within your Apple ecosystem. That said, if automatic device switching or Find My compatibility isn't enough for you to spend $549 on the AirPods Max, there are plenty of premium options.\nAlso: The best iOS 18 features that will make updating your iPhone worthwhile\nThe Sonos Ace deliver all-day comfort, elevated sound technology like Dolby Atmos, adequate noise cancellation, and a posh design for $100 less. If you have a Sonos soundbar, these headphones get even better.\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra have best-in-class noise cancellation, a sporty yet casual design, and spatial audio that's compatible with any device or music streaming service.\nThe Sony XM5 over-ear headphones are slightly older (but not as old as the AirPods Max) but still provide an unassuming design, excellent noise-canceling properties, and 40 hours of listening time, which is the longest out of the bunch."

With so many styles and specifications, it's hard to know what headphones are a good fit for you. When searching for a new pair of headphones, think about the features that matter most to you - be it sound quality, noise cancellation, or price - and make your decision based on those priorities.\nI've tested many headphones over the last year, and my goal is to guide you toward making an informed purchase decision when it's time to invest in a pair of headphones. Some of the headphones on this list are from brands like Sony and Bose, with some headphones close to $400 while others remain under $100, and some headphones cancel noise better than others. Keep reading as I help you find your next go-to headphones.\nWhat are the best over-ear headphones right now?\nMy top pick for the best over-ear headphones goes to the Bose QuietComfort Ultra due to its superior comfort, advanced ANC, and premium design. These headphones boast a list of future-proof software features while staying true to their most important features: strong noise-canceling and all-day comfort.\nThe best over-ear headphones of 2025\nThe Bose QC Ultra headphones are great for people who spend a lot of time working at a desk or commuting. Their ANC does a great job of blocking out office chatter and the low hums of a plane, train, or car. The QC Ultra's all-day comfort makes them perfect for watching videos, taking calls, and listening to music.\nReview: Bose QuietComfort Ultra\nThe Bose QC Ultra are fitted with plushy yet breathable polyurethane earcups for immense comfort and heat management. They have a sporty yet casual design, featuring aluminum headband extenders that fold at the hinges for enhanced portability. They deliver great sound with a prominent bass response and a 2.5mm jack for wired listening.\nBose's latest release puts the quiet in QuietComfort, as the QC Ultra headphones deliver best-in-class noise-canceling. There's no hiss or hum; only loud conversations nearby will cut through the Ultra's ANC. In the Bose app, you can toggle between ANC and transparency modes and access a three-band EQ for customizing your headphones' lows, mids, and highs.\nThe Bose app also offers an easy way to manage your QC Ultra's active audio streams. With Bluetooth 5.3, the QC Ultra have Bluetooth multipoint, and you can easily switch between devices.\nThe QC Ultra's only shortcoming is its relatively short battery life. At 24 hours, the QC Ultra fall behind its competitors from Sony, Sonos, and Beats in this category. Still, they're wonderful for frequent flyers, music enjoyers, and anyone who needs very strong noise-canceling throughout their day.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra tech specs: Form factor: Over-ear | Bluetooth: Yes (5.3) | Battery life: 24 hours (ANC off) | Driver size: 35mm dynamic | Noise cancellation: Yes | Wired option(s): 3.5mm headphone jack\nThe Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are the company's latest flagship and one of the most popular ones on the market. They deliver lots of practicality and utility, making them a solid option for people looking for a pair of premium everyday headphones.\nReview: Sony WH-1000XM5\nThe XM5 headphones have Sony's standard warm, bass-forward sound, and the Sony Connect app offers plenty of features like Speak to Chat, EQ settings, and Bluetooth multipoint device management. Additionally, the XM5 offer quick charging, supplying three hours of listening time after three minutes of charging.\nDespite their impressive and extensive internal audio components, the XM5 over-ear headphones remain light and comfortable for long-term wear. The oversized earcups offer ample room for your ears during lengthy listening sessions.\nThe earcups also house touch controls; wearers can slide and tap their finger on the outside of the cup to control volume and track playback. Other features include access to Sony's hi-res LDAC Bluetooth codec for higher-quality audio with compatible devices, and 360 reality audio when listening on a compatible streaming service.\nThe XM5 are a superb pair of practical, everyday premium headphones, offering users an impressive battery life, all-day comfort, and adequate noise-canceling properties.\nSony WH-1000XM5 tech specs: Form factor: Over-ear | Bluetooth: Yes (5.2) | Battery life: 40 hours (ANC off) | Driver size: 30mm dynamic | Noise cancellation: Yes | Wired option(s): 3.5mm headphone jack\nThe Sennheiser Momentum 4 are the perfect headphones for anyone who likes to take high-quality sound on the go. Not to mention, their 60-hour battery life means you'll get through the week or through a days-long trek in and out of airports without needing to charge them.\nSennheiser's Momentum 4 over-ear headphones are the best wireless option for listeners with a trained ear. Sennheiser is known for its professional-level audio equipment and implemented its higher-caliber audio technology into a pair of consumer headphones.\nReview: Sennheiser Momentum 4\nThe Momentum 4 easily tops Apple, Bose, and Sony in the audio department but certainly falls behind all three in the noise-canceling category. For wireless headphones, the Momentum 4 delivers incredibly clear and detailed audio and offers highly specific EQ settings on a five-band equalizer.\nI recommend these headphones for at-home wireless listening or for people who like to remain aware of their surroundings while they commute, travel, or work in public spaces. When I tested these headphones, I found the Momentum 4 was effective at blocking out the lower pitches of droning noises, like a lawn mower or a running refrigerator, but the higher pitches of these noises will get past these headphones.\nHowever, I also found that the ANC doesn't degrade the Momentum 4's sound quality, something that's very common with other ANC-enabled headphones.\nSennheiser Momentum 4 tech specs: Weight: 10.3 oz (292 g) | Battery life: 60 hours | Bluetooth: Yes (5.2) | Multipoint: Yes\nThe Sonos Ace are the company's first headphones, offering users a condensed version of the esteemed Sonos experience. These headphones are a first-gen product, which means they could use more refining in future generations. However, they're worth it if you already have Sonos products and enjoy the company's signature sound and user experience.\nReview: Sonos Ace\nThe Ace offer thick, plushy ear pads equal to Bose's QuietComfort Ultra regarding comfort. The headband extenders are made from stainless steel, a design accent that delivers a premium look and feel.\nThese headphones are primed for all-day wear, and it's easy to keep them on for hours while watching TV, movies, or YouTube videos. The Sonos Ace are compatible with Dolby Atmos, and offer Sonos' intelligent head-tracking technology, which is reliable, realistic, and adds a layer of immersion when watching TV or listening to music on a Dolby-compatible streaming platform.\nIf you have a compatible Sonos soundbar, you can engage the Ace headphones in TV Audio Swap, which swaps the audio from your soundbar to the headphones with the press of a button. If you live in small spaces or with someone you don't want to disturb with the TV volume, these headphones won't compromise your TV or movie audio.\nThe Sonos Ace are equipped with active noise cancellation and transparency mode, both of which are great but not as good as Bose or Sony's premium headphones.\nAlthough the Sonos Ace aren't as strong as its competitors in the noise-canceling department, these headphones have dynamic and exciting sound, reliable and impressive spatial audio compatibility, and immense comfort. They're great headphones for travel or at-home listening.\nSonos Ace tech specs: Form factor: Over-ear | Bluetooth: Yes (5.4) | Battery life: 30 hours (ANC on) | Driver size: 40mm dynamic | Noise cancellation: Yes | Wired option(s): USB-C\nThe Apple AirPods Max are the best headphones for Apple fanatics. If your tablet, smartphone, TV, and every gadget in between are made by Apple, these are for you. Their seamless integration with Apple devices makes them easy to use, but their hardware and software limitations might frustrate non-Apple users.\nIf you are deeply committed to the Apple ecosystem and you want to keep it that way, you'll want the AirPods Max. The sound quality is great, and Apple's Transparency Mode is easily the best out of all the headphones on this list. The AirPods Max noise-canceling is superior to Sony's XM5 over-ears and follows closely behind Bose's QuietComfort Ultra.\nReview: Apple AirPods Max\nHowever, in terms of functionality, the AirPods Max are not the best you'll find -- unless you have mostly Apple devices.\nTo start, AirPods Max don't have any native EQ settings, and their almost five-year-old Apple H1 chip leaves them without the up-to-date software settings found in the AirPods Pro (2nd generation), like Conversation Awareness and Adaptive Sound Control.\nYou can seamlessly pair the AirPods Max to more than two devices, something Apple holds above other headphones with two-device multipoint connectivity. Still, seamless pairing won't work with AirPods Max unless they're connecting to other Apple devices. Should you connect AirPods Max to an Android or Windows device, you won't get Spatial Audio, wear detection, or access a virtual assistant.\nHardware-wise, the AirPods Max doesn't have a headphone jack or a USB-C port for wired listening. You'll get the superior AAC codec when paired via Bluetooth to Apple devices and the standard SBC codec when paired with non-Apple devices. The lack of audio ports also means you'll have to keep them charged up, especially if you're likely to run down their short 20-hour battery life.\nApple AirPods Max tech specs: Weight: 13.6 oz (384.4 g) | Battery life: 20 hours | Bluetooth: Yes (5.0) | Multipoint: No, but connects to multiple Apple devices\nReview: EarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun Wave Pro tech specs: Weight: 11.04 oz (313 g) | Battery life: 30 hours | Bluetooth: Yes (5.4) | Multipoint: Yes\nThe Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 are the best headphones for those who like an intense bass kick when they listen to music. I also recommend these to people who wear headphones to watch gaming streams or movies on the go. Their deep bass will get you fully immersed in whatever you're watching.\nSkullcandy's Crusher ANC 2 is equipped with Skullcandy's patented Crusher Bass technology that delivers bass you can hear and feel. If you like all things bass, you're bound to find a lot of fun in the Crusher ANC 2. However, the Crusher Bass can be difficult to conquer, and it may be entirely too much for most people.\nReview: Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2\nAmazon customers describe the Crusher ANC 2's bass as \"killer,\" \"crazy,\" \"intense,\" and, sometimes, \"unbearable.\" I can agree; when I wore the Crusher ANC 2 headphones, I made the mistake of maxing out the Crusher Bass, which gave me an instant headache.\nDespite that, the Crusher ANC 2 handles low-frequency sounds very well, and the overall sound quality is good. At high levels, Crusher Bass will muddle a song's higher frequencies and will overwhelm you with songs that are already bass-heavy. You'll have to find the sweet spot in the EQ settings to get the most out of these, so be prepared to play with the sound for a few minutes.\nThe Crusher ANC 2's companion app is loaded with software, including Spotify Tap, voice assistants, and more. The only software feature Skullcandy omits from these headphones is wear detection.\nOverall, Skullcandy's Crusher ANC 2 are not your first choice if you're looking for a practical pair of everyday headphones. Their build is bulky, and the bass can get out of hand. However, the Crusher Bass feature will make movie and video-watching more enjoyable than you can imagine.\nAlthough I wouldn't recommend working out in over-ear headphones (more on that below), I can see why people would want to work out in these. The Crusher ANC 2 can reach and beautifully reproduce low-frequency sounds, and their sound is perfect for motivating you to lift some heavy weight or go on an intense run.\nSkullcandy Crusher ANC 2 tech specs: Weight: 11.7 oz (332 g) | Battery life: 60 hours | Bluetooth: Yes (5.2) | Multipoint: Yes\nIf you enjoy a balanced and clear sound, you'll enjoy Audio-Technica's ATH-M50xBT2 headphones. For those who mix and master music, whether you're learning about music production in college or running a business that requires you to focus on audio editing professionally, you should try these.\nAudio-Technica's ATH-M50xBT2 headphones are the most no-frills headphones you can find in a world full of confusing buttons, capacitive touch controls, and lengthy software updates. If you don't believe me, you can stick to wired listening and never connect these headphones to your device's Bluetooth and still get the most out of them. Very retro.\nReview: Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT2\nHowever, \"BT\" is in the product name, and their Bluetooth connectivity is easy and stable. Aside from modern button controls and Bluetooth capabilities, the BT2 headphones aren't much different from their ATH-line of successors from the early 2000s. When I tested the BT2 headphones, I appreciated their simplicity.\nThese headphones' 45mm dynamic drivers deliver a very balanced and clear sound, as they're studio headphones made for mixing and mastering audio. The BT2 could definitely work as \"baby's first studio headphones\" since their $200 price tag is reasonable for what you get. Amazon customers say the BT2 headphones deliver a flat, balanced, and neutral sound, making them ideal for critical listening and audio editing.\nYou'll get AAC, LDAC, and standard SBC Bluetooth codecs, and you can listen losslessly with a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can also use the headphone jack if you're low on battery, but the BT2 will stick around for 60 hours before the battery dies.\nAudio-Technica ATH-M50xBT2 tech specs: Weight: 10.6 oz (303 g) | Battery life: 60 hours | Bluetooth: Yes (5.0) | Multipoint: Yes\nI recommend the Soundcore Space One headphones for anyone looking for a backup pair of headphones to take on their daily commute or on long traveling stretches. I'd also recommend them to anyone who wants an affordable pair of headphones that don't skimp on the software features.\nThe Soundcore Space One headphones are a capable and comfortable pair of headphones that won't break the bank. When it comes to sound, the Space One sound is great for its $100 price tag, but you shouldn't expect out-of-this-world sound quality. Best Buy customers say these headphones are a great catch for their price, and some recommend these headphones for kids.\nReview: Soundcore Space One\nDespite that, their build quality is surprisingly well-made for their affordable price. You'll appreciate their nice build because you don't get a hardshell case to carry them in for storage and protection. The Space One's plushy and thick headband and ear cup cushions offered me a great deal of comfort when I tested them, and their relaxed fit is optimal for hours-long wear. However, the shallow ear cups interfere with sound quality and can cause discomfort for some.\nThe Space One also has many of the same software features you'll find in a pair of $400 headphones like the Sony XM5 over-ear headphones. Wear detection, conversation mode, EQ settings, software-to-hardware shortcuts, and ANC are included with the Space One. Their ANC, however, isn't anything to write home about, as it has a harder time blocking out the lower pitches of sounds like a running refrigerator, AC unit, or plane engine.\nAnker SoundCore Space One tech specs: Weight: 9.3 oz. | Battery life: 55 hours | Bluetooth: Yes | Multipoint: Yes\nWhat are the best over-ear headphones?\nThere's a saying that goes, \"One man's trash is another man's treasure.\" That's how I feel about headphones. For every pair in this list, you can find reviewers and consumers saying your favorite pair of headphones are trash. But to you, they're the best thing since sliced bread.\nThere's no definitive answer to this question, even though I know I'm here to help you decide which pair of headphones are the best and which one you should spend your money on. However, keep in mind that there's no pair of headphones out there that can score a 10 all-around.\nSome headphones are better at noise-canceling and don't have the best sound, while others have a longer battery life but may not be the most comfortable to wear for hours on end. So hopefully, this list helped you assess your audio wants and needs so you can make the best decision for what you want.\nRemember that buying the right pair of headphones is a personal decision, and you should look for a pair that checks all of your boxes because you'll likely spend hundreds of dollars on them.\nThis table gives a brief breakdown of important factors like price, battery life, and if the headphones have ANC. You can frequently find all of these headphones for a discounted price throughout the year, but what you'll see below are the standard list prices.\n| Headphones | Price | Battery life | ANC |\n| Bose QuietComfort Ultra | $429 | 24 hours (18 with ANC and Immersive Audio) | Yes |\n| Sony WH-1000XM5 | $400 | 40 hours (30 with ANC) | Yes |\n| Sennheiser Momentum 4 | $380 | 60+ hours (at least 60 with ANC) | Yes |\n| Apple AirPods Max | $529 | 20 hours (20 with ANC) | Yes |\n| Sonos Ace | $449 | 30 hours (with ANC) | Yes |\n| Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 | $220 | 60 hours (50 with ANC) | Yes |\n| Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT2 | $199 | 60+ hours | No |\n| Soundcore Space One | $99 | 55 hours (40 with ANC) | Yes |\n*Lowest price at the time of writing. Please note that prices may vary based on retailer and available promotions, sales, or discounts.\nWhich are the right over-ear headphones for you?\nIt can be confusing trying to choose between all the headphones out there, so here are ZDNET's suggestions to help you quickly decide which of our picks best suits your needs.\n| Choose these best over-ear headphones... | If you want... |\n| Bose QuietComfort Ultra | Headphones with top-tier comfort and noise-canceling. |\n| Sony WH-1000XM5 | Headphones with all the software you can think of. |\n| Sennheiser Momentum 4 | Headphones with professional-level audio quality. |\n| Apple AirPods Max | Headphones that will seamlessly blend into your Apple device ecosystem. |\n| Sonos Ace | Headphones best for watching movies and TV shows. |\n| Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 | Headphones to satisfy your need for heavy bass. |\n| Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT2 | Headphones with simple controls, minimal software, and studio functionality. |\n| Soundcore Space One | Headphones that give you the most for an affordable price. |\nFactors to consider when choosing over-ear headphones\nTo find the best over-ear headphones, I considered several factors that may also help you with your search. Sound is a highly subjective metric, even though it can be measured objectively on charts and graphs. Despite that, it's one of the most important metrics when choosing a pair of headphones.\n- Sound: The ability to properly filter and highlight sound is critical in a pair of over-ear headphones, especially where noise cancellation is concerned. The headphones in this list have internal audio drivers that range from 30mm to 45mm in diameter. Drivers are responsible for converting audio signals into sound waves, and usually, the bigger the driver, the louder the headphones will be. However, there are many internal components that dictate sound quality, and sound quality is subjective and varies from person to person.\n- Comfort: Nothing is worse than a pair of over-ear headphones that are too tight, heavy, or hot. We tried all the headphones in this list and tried to find the best options to accommodate everyone's audio needs. Most headphones are comfortable for hours-long wear. However, others may only be suitable for short-term wear based on what you're doing, like watching a movie or editing audio.\n- Battery: Battery life is important to help ensure your headphones are ready when you need them. In this list, Sony, Apple, and Bose offer headphones with the shortest battery life, while Sennheiser, Soundcore, Audio-Technica, and Skullcandy offer the longest. Sony, Apple, and Bose headphones have a shorter battery life because the ANC is stronger, and the bonus audio features run in the background, which takes more battery.\n- Cost: Budget is a concern for most shoppers, so we shop for affordable models that won't break the bank. However, we recognize that some people want to spend extra money on headphones in hopes that more expensive headphones will deliver higher-quality sound, comfort, and noise-canceling capabilities.\nHow I test over-ear headphones\nAlthough sound can be measured objectively on charts and graphs, sound quality varies from person to person. When I test headphones, I include my opinion of their sound, but I also use them in real-world scenarios to help you better understand their effectiveness.\nAlso: How we test headphones at ZDNET\nI wear headphones in coffee shops, grocery stores, libraries, and other public places to test how much of my environment I can hear with noise-canceling enabled. I also wear headphones for hours on end to decide how comfortable they are.\nFinally, I test a pair of headphones for at least two weeks before writing about them, as your experience with a pair can greatly differ from day one to day 12.\nWhat are the best over-ear headphones for working out?\nIt's my job to be honest with you. So, with that in mind, I would not recommend over-ear headphones for exercising. Over-ear headphones are simply not built for rigorous, strenuous, or super-sweaty workout sessions.\nConsumer tech companies get their products independently tested to receive an internationally standardized IP rating. Most over-ear headphones don't have an official IP (ingress protection) rating. Your smartphone probably has an IP68 rating, which means it's fully protected from water and dust. This high rating is why you can fully submerge your smartphone in water for a short period, and it (hopefully) won't incur severe damage.\nOn the other hand, your over-ear headphones most likely did not receive a formal IP rating. In fact, none of the headphones featured in this list have an official IP rating. The lack of an IP rating means the company did not formally test the headphones for dust or water ingress, meaning you should assume your over-ears are unprotected from solids (dust) or water splashes, droplets, and sprays.\nMany over-ear headphones, especially ones with hybrid or active noise-canceling properties, have speakers and microphones on the outside of the ear cups. Water can easily pass through the openings that house the speakers and mics, which can hinder the device's performance.\nIf you choose to exercise in your over-ears or wear them in the rain, your sweat or rainwater may damage the ear cup fabric or the internal audio components. You also risk water seeping into the buttons or accumulating on the ear cups, which can hinder the buttons' functionality or interfere with any tap/swipe controls on the ear cups. Not to mention, you'll increase the heat buildup inside the ear cups if you choose to exercise in your over-ear headphones, which can make them uncomfortable to wear.\nI suggest investing in a pair of earbuds for exercising, which usually have an IPX4 rating or higher. This rating makes them splash and sweat-resistant and more suitable for rigorous workouts.\nWhat are over-ear headphones?\nOver-ear headphones sit around the ear rather than on or in the ear. They are designed to provide a more immersive listening experience by completely enclosing the ear and blocking out external noise. Over-ear headphones also offer more isolation from external noises, as the better the seal the headphones make with your ear, the better the noise-canceling tech will perform. The ear cups on over-ear headphones are also typically large and padded, providing comfort for extended use.\nOver-ear headphones come in both wired and wireless versions. They are typically larger in size compared to other types of headphones, and they are often preferred by audiophiles, music producers, office workers, students, and gamers -- especially because some of the high-end models have active noise cancellation to further block out noise.\nWhich over-the-ear headphones are most durable?\nSony's WH-1000XM5, Bose's QuietComfort Ultra, Sonos' Ace, Soundcore's Space One, and Apple's AirPods Max all have great build quality and durability.\nHowever, Apple and Soundcore don't include a hardshell protective case in your purchase, so if you're traveling, you'll want to keep these headphones close to your person to avoid scratches and scrapes.\nWhich over-ear headphones are most comfortable?\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones are the most comfortable on this list. Their ear cups and headband are padded with soft, plushy protein leather. I wore the QuietComfort Ultra headphones for at least six hours a day for a week without discomfort.\nThat said, Apple's AirPods Max, Sony's WH-1000XM5, Sonos' Ace, and Soundcore's Space One are honorable mentions, as the ear cups sport soft, thick padding that can withstand an entire day's worth of wear.\nAre there alternative over-ear headphones worth considering?\nYes! While the headphones listed above are what we consider the best over-ear headphones, there are plenty of other headphones on the market that may be worth a second look."

      "text": "What is Liquid Glass? Here's everything we know about Apple's major UI overhaul at WWDC\nWWDC 2025 is underway, and Apple has unveiled a new year-based naming convention for its iPhone operating system: what would have been iOS 19 is now officially iOS 26, since 2026 will be the year most people are running the software. Alongside this change, Apple introduced a sweeping visual overhaul dubbed Liquid Glass (previously rumored under the internal codename \"Solarium\").\nAlso: Apple's secret sauce is exactly what AI is missing\nLiquid Glass brings a glass-inspired aesthetic not only to iOS 26 but to all of Apple's platforms. While on stage at WWDC, the company pitched it as a unified design language coming to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, Vision Pro, and Apple TV.\nWhat is Liquid Glass?\nLiquid Glass is Apple's biggest design update since iOS 7 -- which famously ditched skeuomorphic features in favor of a flat look. Apple said Liquid Glass layers semitransparent \"glass\" materials throughout iOS 26, iPadOS 26, MacOS 15, WatchOS 10, TVOS 16, and VisionOS 4. This translucent look can refract and reflect whatever's behind it and adapt its tint for both light and dark modes.\nAlso: How to install iOS 26 on your iPhone (and which models support it)\nWhat's new in Liquid Glass?\nRumors had hinted that Apple's next UI overhaul would introduce glass-like translucency. At WWDC 2025, those whispers became reality with the unveiling of Liquid Glass, a unified, cross-platform design language. Apple demonstrated how Liquid Glass adds consistent depth, translucency, and motion-responsive effects across its entire device lineup.\nAlso: Your entire iPhone screen is now searchable with new Visual Intelligence features\nFor instance, on the iPhone's Lock Screen, the time numerals can now \"nestle\" into your wallpaper and pick up its colors. Meanwhile, in MacOS 15, the Dock and menu bar can go fully transparent or take on tinted or clear looks that let your wallpaper, widgets, and icons shine. And across apps like Safari, Apple Music, News, and Podcasts, tab bars float in a frosted-glass layer -- shrinking when you scroll down to put content front and center and re-expanding when you scroll back up.\n- Glass reflections: A new translucent material refracts its surroundings, adapts its tint for light or dark modes, and reacts with specular highlights.\n- App icons: New squircle glyphs sit beneath transparent surfaces that bend wallpaper colors and animate subtly with a tap.\n- Widgets: Glass panels let your background peek through, cast gentle shadows, and animate ever so slightly.\n- Navigation bars: In iOS 26, tab bars shrink on scroll-down and re-expand on scroll-up; on iPadOS and MacOS, sidebars refract whatever's behind them to keep context.\n- Panels and menus: Control Center, Notification Center, and sidebars sport a frosted look, with sliders, buttons, and sheets floating above content.\n- Toolbars: In Safari and similar apps, toolbars turn semi-transparent and resize fluidly as you scroll.\n- Developer APIs: A new set of Liquid Glass materials and components is available to third-party developers, enabling apps easily to adopt the same translucency and motion-responsive effects.\nAlso: Apple will bring any photo on the iPhone to life with 3D spatial effects\nWhich platforms get Liquid Glass?\nApple confirmed that Liquid Glass spans its entire software lineup:\n- iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and MacOS 15: All system panels (Control Center, notifications, etc.), toolbars, sidebars, windows, app icons, and widgets now use Liquid Glass materials -- complete with translucent frosted layers, rounded corners that mirror device bezels, and floating controls that morph and recede to keep content front and center.\n- WatchOS 10: Every UI element -- from notifications to watch-face complications -- now uses Liquid Glass, improving legibility and visual harmony with rounded corners and translucent menus.\n- TVOS 16: The Apple TV Home Screen and app pages feature frosted backdrops behind app tiles, while the top-bar navigation and action overlays adopt the same translucent Liquid Glass styling for a cohesive look with Apple's other platforms.\n- VisionOS 4: Builds on its spatial-computing roots by refining its floating windows and 3D iconography to match the new Liquid Glass style, unifying headset and handheld experiences.\nRelease schedule\nAs with previous years, developer and public betas of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and the rest will roll out over the summer, with final public releases and new hardware arriving around September 2025.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

  "argos_summary": "The AirPods Max remain a top choice for Apple users thanks to seamless device switching, improved low\u2011latency audio via a 2025 iOS\u202f18.4 update, and lossless USB\u2011C support, making them viable for professional audio and gaming.
