  "description": "Will streaming's inferior quality render expensive AV equipment obsolete?",
  "content": "While the shine of streaming services seems to be dulling right now, there's no getting around the fact that in the long run plastic discs with movies and shows on them will probably stop being a thing.\n\nWhich might not bother the vast majority of people who like to watch movies and shows, but if you're a bit of an enthusiast who likes the sound of a high-end home theater, it begs the question: is there any point?\n\nThe home theater has always been the sign of enthusiasm for visual media like film and TV shows. For someone to purposefully design and build a home entertainment setup that tries to mimic the theater experience is anything but casual. This is something that happens at every point on the budget spectrum too. Whether you bought a cheap 5.1 surround system off eBay or you've remodeled a room in your home with thousands of dollars in AV equipment, the sentiment is basically the same.\n\nAt the top of this spectrum, there aren't many customers. Which makes sense. It's like saying there aren't that many supercar customers. It's a niche market, but these few well-heeled movie fans keep it going. This is the type of audience my personal holy grail Blu-ray player the Panasonic DP-UB9000P1K is aimed at.\n\nThere are several companies dedicated to making boutique home theater hardware\u2014everything from extremely expensive cables to projectors and speakers. They cater to people who want the absolute best experience, and don't mind paying for it.\n\nHome Theaters Make the Most of Physical Media\n\nWith perhaps the notable exception of VHS, home media have generally packed in more visual and audio quality than the average TV can faithfully reproduce. Certainly, with the advent of DVD, Blu-ray, and now UHD Blu-ray discs, there's a lot of information packed into the video and audio streams. Paired with the right TV and sound system, you'd have a hard time believing this was the same disc you watched on your Black Friday special TV set.\n\nBasically, physical media give high-end AV equipment a lot to work with when it comes to bitrate and the richness of the information, which even helps with enhancements like upscaling where it's very much a case of \"garbage in, garbage out.\"\n\nWhile good home theater equipment can make physical media shine, when it comes to streaming content you're basically feeding these devices empty calories. They'll be starved for bitrate, and you're probably not going to get appreciably better results than any mid-range OLED or mini-LED TV can offer. What makes it even worse is the variable nature of streaming, but you can get around this by downloading your streams before playing them. Unfortunately, this is generally only allowed on the mobile versions of streaming apps.\n\nThe thing is, a DVD, BD, or UHD BD disc is mastered to offer you the best quality possible within the storage confines of that disc. An expert human mastering engineer has spent many hours tweaking the encode for that release to get the most out of their storage budget. Well, the good releases are like this, at least.\n\nThe incentive with a streaming service is not to offer you the best quality possible for your available bandwidth. Whether you have 100Mbps or 1000Mbps of broadband, everyone gets the same 4K streaming, if that. The streams are optimized to offer the worst quality viewers will accept while saving the streaming platform as much money as possible.\n\nIf Streaming Is the Quality Ceiling, What\u2019s the Point of Home Theaters?\n\nOK, so what's the problem? Stop complaining, and just buy your movies and shows on disc. Get that quality and everyone's happy, right? Well, that's what I would do if content publishers hadn't decided to stop releasing their programs on disc. Even prestige streaming providers like Apple want nothing to do with Blu-ray. There are some exceptions, usually where Apple isn't the sole owner of the content. Which is why you can buy some of these shows on disc, but often not within the North American region.\n\nRegardless, if this aggressively bitrate-starved, highly-compressed video quality is the best that anyone can get, what's the point in having high-end AV equipment? Why bother buying that expensive OLED when going ahead streams will look the same on a mid-range model?\n\nThere Might Be Light at the End of the Tunnel\n\nAs much as it pains me to say it, I don't think physical media will be around to solve this issue in the long term. Which means the only solution is to increase the quality of streaming and digital downloads.\n\nNow, as internet bandwidth becomes faster and cheaper, we might see streaming providers increase the quality options to match what we have with the best physical media today. A 4K UHD Blu-ray usually hovers around the 100Mbps mark when it comes to bitrate, and discs top out at 144Mbps or thereabouts, so it's not as if fast modern internet connections couldn't technically handle these levels of quality. Then again, you could serve about six current 4K quality streams for that same bandwidth, so the business case is hard to make.\n\nSome companies, like Kaleidascape are trying to cater to high-end home theater owners with an all-digital solution, but I'd really like to see the likes of Netflix offer some sort of \"Ultra Premium\" tier for people who want the absolute best quality stream regardless of the cost. It still won't make me happy that physical media is on life support, but at least we could still get the same quality experience.",

  "summary": "The article discusses the potential demise of high-end home theater theaters due to the increasing popularity of streaming services. While physical media provides high-quality audio and visual quality, streaming services offer less value due to variable quality of streaming content. However, this gives valuable value to high-priced AV equipment such as Panasonic's DP-UB9000P1K. While good home theater equipment can make physical media shine, streaming content can lead to an empty calorie diet for devices starved for bitrate. The article suggests that the only solution to this issue is to increase the quality of digital digital downloads. It also suggests that as bandwidth becomes faster and cheaper, streaming providers might increase their quality options to match what we have with physical media.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Budget miniLED TVs from Hisense and TCL are delivering great image quality.\n- These TVs offer premium features like higher refresh rates and quantum dots.\n- Dropping prices mean you can now get larger TVs without breaking the bank.\nI still tend to think of miniLED technology as a high-end feature, with affordable entry-level and mainstream TVs still using backlighting, or a low number of large dimming zones. However, that's just not true anymore. There are now miniLED TVs for well under a thousand dollars\u2014and they are awesome.\nThe floor on image quality has been raised so much over the past few years that even mid-range TVs from the late 2010s look pretty awful compared to next-generation budget TVs today, and I think the base level of image quality on offer now makes it very hard to justify spending big bucks on a TV, even if you're something of a videophile.\nWhat Is a Mini-LED TV, and Why Would You Want One?\nMini-LED TVs offer more local dimming zones, which means improved contrast and deeper blacks. They're not hugely expensive, either. Here's what you need to know.\nTCL and Hisense Are Killing It With Budget miniLED TVs\nThe two companies largely making this possible are TCL and Hisense. Yes, they are both manufacturers based in China, so the ongoing tariff situation may affect any discussion of price. However, since almost all TVs sold in the USA are made in China, South Korea, Mexico, and Vietnam the relative pricing advantages should stay the same. At least, I hope they do!\nHisense U7N\n- Dimensions\n- 57 x 33 x 3.0 (without stand)\n- Display Technology\n- LCD Mini-LED\nWhile the TCL and Hisense brands weren't that well-known in the US, these are long-time established companies that are fully vertically-integrated and make their own TVs almost in their entirety. TCL has been making panels for companies like Samsung for ages. So even before you knew who TCL was, you may have purchased a TV containing its screen technology.\nBoth of these companies have developed a reputation for decent quality and reliability at significantly lower prices than more premium brands, and it's thanks to that aggressive pricing we're now seeing miniLED technology in TVs that are so affordable. These TVs are reviewing darn well.\nFor example, the Hisense U7N (which I am seriously considering for myself) got a 7.5 overall through TV experts RTings. The TCL QM7K got a score of 7.8 from the same outlet. We're talking about TVs that range from $600 to $900 for the 55-inch models, and I have seen them go on sale several times a year with prices closer to the $500 mark.\nThese TVs Punch Far Above Their Weight\nThe one major reason that these budget TVs offer such a big uplift in the image quality department is down to miniLED technology. Instead of having a backlight, or edge-lit LCD panel, you have hundreds or even thousands of tiny LEDs arranged in a grid behind the screen. Each LED can be dimmed or switched off individually, allowing for much, much better contrast and black levels.\nThis makes it possible for miniLED displays to get you (subjectively) 80% of the way to the contrast and black levels of an OLED, but at a fraction of the price and without other common OLED drawbacks like brightness issues or image retention. Don't get me wrong, if money's no object OLED is the way to go, but miniLED closes the gap by a lot. As someone who owns an LG CS OLED as my main living room TV, an edge-lit budget Samsung QLED as my bedroom TV, and several premium miniLED screens in my Apple devices, I can tell you these cheap miniLED displays knocked my socks off in the showroom.\nAnd I do absolutely recommend that you go see them for yourself, rather than just ordering one online sight-unseen. Something I'd say to anyone buying a TV. You might be more sensitive to bloom, which is one weakness of miniLED tech, for example. Though in the case of the two models I mentioned above, it's well-controlled.\nWhat Is \"Blooming\" or the \"Halo Effect\" on a Monitor or TV?\nShould you worry about \"blooming\" on your new TV?\nPremium Features Make Expensive TVs Less Sensible\nIf it was just the raw benefit of miniLED backlighting, then I would already be pretty excited for the budget and midrange TV market, but it goes beyond that. For example, these TVs usually have quantum dots. They offer native refresh rates of 120Hz and 144Hz, and support HDMI VRR, AMD Freesync, and NVIDIA G-sync. These are all premium features that could only be found in much more expensive model not too long ago. You'll find proper HDR brightness levels, and support for standards like HDR10+ and DolbyVision. For all intents and purposes these TVs are feature complete.\nSo, if I were a gamer using a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X (and I am), I'd find one of these TVs mighty attractive right now. Based on the professional evaluations I've seen of this new generation of budget miniLED, we're zoning in on the sweet spot of price and image quality.\nHave a look at this review of the Hisense U7N by TV luminary Caleb Denison, and you'll see exactly what I mean.\nYou Can Upsize for the Same Money\nOne big advantage of this drop in price for a given image quality level and feature set is that if you choose to keep your budget the same, you can probably move a step or two up in size. That means you now have the opportunity to get a 65-inch TV instead of the 55-inch you would have bought before, or a 75-inch instead of the more popular 65-inch size.\nThere Are Some Catches\nObviously, there has to be some sort of catch, and there is. However, it's not really a deal-breaker. Both of these companies have developed a decent level of quality control over the years, and often offer longer warranty periods than the likes of Samsung or LG, probably in part to help people get over their hesitance to go with a new brand that sells at lower prices.\nOn the technical side, you might not always get the fastest chips for the smart TV part of the equation, but then that was always true of budget TVs in this price range with much worse picture quality. These TVs tend to make use of Google TV as their platform, which is frankly a good thing and means decent long-term support. I'll take that over a poorly-supported proprietary operating system any day.\nHonestly, I'm looking at my entry-level 55-inch Samsung QLED that I bought four years ago and wondering why exactly I shouldn't just sell it and buy one of these miniLED TVs instead. So far I haven't come up with many good reason, so it looks like I might be getting myself a new TV for Christmas this year."

      "text": "Summary\n- Blu-ray disc quality surpasses streaming due to bitrate differences & resulting visual issues.\n- Physical media remain the optimal choice over streaming for superior quality but may become niche.\n- Kaleidascape offers high-quality video streaming, but substantial hardware investment is necessary.\nThe gulf in quality between a Blu-ray disc and even the best mainstream streaming services is vast. It's not just something video nerds notice! Which is why I always advocate buying your favorite shows and movies on disc, but for most people, convenience seems to trump all.\nHowever, what if you could get a similar level of quality downloading over the internet? Like the video version of hi-resolution audio? Well, it is possible, but it may throw the convenience factor out that streaming and digital downloads are meant to offer in the first place.\nStreaming Video Has a Bitrate Problem\nThe whole reason this is even an issue comes down to the enormous difference in bit-rate between typical streaming services and physical media. A 4K UHD Blu-ray can have a bitrate of up to 128Mbps, and a standard Blu-ray is around 40Mbps for a 1080p video. A 4K stream from a service like Netflix or Amazon might top out at 25Mbps,but is usually quite a bit less. Even with the magic of modern high-efficiency video codecs, that's still a massive difference in quality.\nThese 4K streams look OK, but if you have a higher-end TV or a very large TV, the cracks become apparent. Even on most mainstream TVs you can clearly see motion smearing, macro-blocking, color banding in scene elements such as the sky or darkness, worse color reproduction, and the list goes on. If you're someone who has never watched a Blu-ray, then I suppose ignorance is bliss, but for those of us coming from physical media to streaming, it's always been a sore point.\nThe Best Antidote Is Physical Media\nClearly, the best solution is simply to buy your favorite movies and shows on Blu-ray. Personally, I prefer this route because it's affordable, simple, and accessible to just about everyone.\nHowever, I'm also a realist and I know that physical media will likely just become more niche over the years, especially as internet coverage increases, bandwidth widens, and access to large, cheap home storage becomes common. Like many people I have a home media server, and I have the option of creating \"rips\" of my Blu-ray discs on that server to stream them locally.\nHowever, even with minimal compression that won't affect the perceived quality of the video, these rips are absolutely enormous, so it's not the most practical solution. It's no wonder services like Netflix aren't keen to offer a \"lossless\" video streaming option, since hosting and serving these files over the internet is currently unsustainable.\nIn other words, a small plastic disc dedicated to storing the best quality version of the media still looks like the best solution today, on balance.\nWhy I Bought Star Trek on Blu-ray Despite Streaming Services\nI don't have to suffer from saucer-separation anymore.\nA Reference Video Streamer Has Entered the Arena\nHowever, if you do want something as good as Blu-ray on a streaming service, you do have at least one option in the form of Kaleidascape.\nKaleidscape describes itself as \"...the only digital provider of movies with lossless audio and full reference video quality.\" and there are a few things to unpack here. First off, lossless audio is just what it says on the tin: audio that contains all the original recorded information. Basically, it doesn't get better than this in terms of source material, so it's up to your audio gear to make the most of it.\nWho Needs Gigabit Internet? I Do, And You Might Too\nI felt the need, the need for really fast internet.\nThe second part is a little more complex. \"Reference\" quality generally means that what you get is the gold-standard. It's what other formats or versions of something are compared to. So the pitch here is that the video you get is exactly as the original creators intended. Kaleidascape promises \"pixel-perfect\" videos with no compression artifacts or any blemishes that aren't intentional.\nSo, as with lossless audio, it's your actual gear that makes the difference in how good things look. The media shouldn't be the limiting factor.\nLossless vs. Hi-Res Audio: What's the Difference?\nAnd which one is more important if you're looking for the best listening experience?\nThere\u2019s a Steep Hardware Investment\nThis sounds pretty great, but sadly, as it stands, you can't just buy or rent movies from this service and start playing them on your Apple TV or Android box. You probably need to purchase one of the company's movie servers to download and store the movies in question, and also a special movie player for each room where you want to watch those movies.\nThe servers have hundreds of terabytes of storage space, and download movies, music concerts, and series in the background so that you can watch them later regardless of internet performance. Some of the players on offer have their own internal storage, which means a server isn't strictly necessary, but if you don't have blazing-fast internet, those downloads will take a while.\nKaleidascape also recommends that you have a pretty high-end home theater, and the company has a pretty comprehensive set of guides on how they want you to build your home theater. So yeah, we're not looking at a small investment here.\nAt Least Someone Is Working on It\nIf you're already set up to make the most of Blu-ray movies, then Kaleidascape's offering presents a way to get the same or similar quality over the internet, perhaps long before those discs release. In some cases, a physical version of a series or movie is never coming. In which case, we're forever stuck with the inferior compressed version for streaming or downloads, unless a high-quality file is on offer. However, according to Kaleidascape its media is about ten times the size of what services like Netflix offer, so it's not going mainstream any time soon.\nThat said, if we're going to leave physical media behind, those of us who care about the technical quality of our films and series should have some sort of digital-only option that lives up to what we still have today in the form of Blu-ray. There seems little point in studios producing such high-quality media, and then the only place you can see it in its full glory is the cinema, and then never again. So I hope more companies decide to provide this option one day."

      "text": "Summary\n- The Panasonic DP-UB9000 is a top-tier Blu-ray player praised for cinema-accurate image processing.\n- The player supports HDR formats like HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, providing the intended viewing experience.\n- The UB9000 offers high-res audio capabilities, various output options, and a durable, noise-reducing design.\nWhen my boss Dan asked me \"What would you say was your 'holy grail' Blu-ray player?\", I'd never even thought about it. My stance has always been to get the best bang-for-buck tech I can. So, I decided to think about it, and from the heavens descended the Panasonic DP-UB9000.\nThe Panasonic DP-UB9000 was launched all the way back in 2018, with a refreshed \"mk2\" model released a few years later. Both are identical save for a difference in audio chip, which Panasonic changed for supply chain reasons. Regardless of which version you get, the Panasonic DP-UB9000 is widely lauded as the videophile's player of choice, and looking at what's under that brushed aluminum shell, I can see why.\nIncredible Cinema-Accurate Image Processing\nPansonic refers to this as a \"reference\" player, and just like other \"reference\" video and audio gear, this means the DP-UB9000 is designed to accurately reproduce the video image as intended by the creators of the content.\nThe Best Projector Screens of 2024\nUpgrade your home movie nights with these fantastic projection screens!\nThis is possible thanks to a specialized, high-performance image processing chip referred to as the Panasonic Hollywood Cinema Experience (HCX) processor. This chip works to convert the image from the Blu-ray to its true and accurate representation in terms of color, contrast, clarity, and brightness.\nIt's effectively an \"upscaler,\" but for more than just resolution and detail. The chip takes into account what your display is capable of, and then does the best with what you give it. You also get bit-perfect translation of the video without resorting to chroma subsampling (excellently explained by RTINGS), though the average person would certainly be unable to tell that they are getting a slightly worse image in return for big bandwidth savings.\nNonetheless, the UB9000 promises to be a reference player, and so whether you can tell at a glance or not, it offers the most technically correct picture it can on your display.\nWide HDR Format Support\nWhile I've seen this player almost universally praised for its image reproduction, a lot of that is down to its support for the best HDR formats. This means HDR10+ and Dolby Vision.Paired with a display with the right specs and HDR support, the UB9000 will make it literally shine, and, again, give you the experience intended by the content creator. It also supports standard HDR and HLG, so you're pretty much covered for every type of HDR format you're likely to encounter.\nThe player's HDR optimizer feature is widely considered the best in the business, and you can see why in this demo video.\nThis is a big deal, since it means that any display device, including home theater projectors, will retain more detail with HDR footage, because the optimizer maps the original HDR data into a brightness range that the display can actually produce.\nHi-Res Audio With Numerous Output Options\nIf anything, the audio capabilties of the UB9000 are even more impressive than its image quality chops. Both of the versions have a high-end digital-to-analog converter and a balanced analogue audio output circuit, so you can hook it up to your fancy analogue home theater receiver. The audio subsystem has its own separate power supply, to eliminate interference.\nSadly, this player does not support audiophile disc formats like SACD or DVD-A, but it does support just about every digital format that matters: WAV/FLAC/WMA/AIFF/AAC/MP3 formats, DSD (2.8 MHz/5.6 MHz/11.2MHz) and ALAC music files.\nConnection options for the audio include the aforementioned balanced analog XLR/RCA, twin HDMI, and 7.1 channel, optical and coaxial audio connections.\nBuilt to Last (and to Be Quiet)\nThis is the sort of device that seems to be hewn from a solid slab of metal. The DP-UB9000 has a rigid aluminum body designed to stick things out for the long haul. So if you're looking for a player that will go nicely in your doomsday bunker, this seems to be it. It's anodized (what the Japanese often call \"alumite-treated\") which both looks nice and helps prevent corrosion, and weighs in at a hefty 17.2lbs! This also cuts down on vibration and noise from the drive and its moving components.\nThe fact of the matter is that the UB9000 is solidly out of my budget. My current non-4K player cost me almost $200 and that felt hard to justify at the time. However, if the Editor-in-Chief handed me the company credit card and said \"You can buy any Blu-ray player you want.\" then this would be the one I gleefully swipe for."

There's both more of it than you might think, and it tends to be at the upper end of prestige television too.\nWhich means that I would really like to collect some of these TV series and films, but it's just not possible. One exception is Severance, which did get a season 1 release on Blu-ray.\nThat being said, I prefer buying TV series box sets when the show is complete, and at this point I don't know how many of the seasons will get a physical release.\nWhy I Bought Star Trek on Blu-ray Despite Streaming Services\nI don't have to suffer from saucer-separation anymore.\nApple\u2019s Shows Are Worth Owning and Collecting\nIf Severance gets a complete release on Blu-ray eventually, I'll almost certainly snap it up, but what about all the other great shows?\nWhat about the sci-fi epic Foundation? I can buy a hardcover production art book of the show no problem, but there's no way to own the actual show itself. That's right, there's no way to own the show, not as a disc or as a digital download.\nLikewise, shows like Silo and Slow Horses are also not available as physical media. Though you're welcome to buy the books these shows are based on, with a nice Apply TV+ sticker on the front cover to remind you that you should be a subscriber. Apple's upcoming series Murderbot is based on one of my favorite books series, and I just know that there will probably never be a Blu-ray for me to collect.\nOf course, and somewhat ironically, Apple's shows are not immune to piracy and those willing to sail the seven seas of the internet have access to offline copies of these movies and episodes, even though Apple won't give its legitimate customers the option to do the same.\nApple Is Losing Money on Its Streaming Shows\nWhile there is no official confirmation of this, I think at least part of the reason Apple doesn't do physical releases might be that Apple is losing a billion dollars annually on its streaming service, as reported by Variety.\nOne of the reasons I think this is happening comes down to how bad Apple is at marketing its shows. I bet most of you reading this don't even know two-thirds of the content the service has to offer. It's understandable if you checked it out in the early days, watched everything and bounced, but if Apple simply let people know about their new programs, then more people would subscribe to watch them.\nApple TV+ Has Great Content but Weirdly Poor Marketing\nHow does a trillion dollar company end up making hidden gems?\nThere\u2019s No Downside to Releasing Physical Shows\nI can't prove it, but I think part of the reason Apple is shying away from physical releases of its media comes down to concerns that those move sales will cannibalize Apple TV+ subscriptions. If that is the case, I have to disagree for a few reasons.\nFirst, the physical releases come long after the shows have been released on the streaming platform. Anyone who wanted to just watch the show would already be subscribed for that purpose, and if they don't want to stick around, that has nothing to do with a disc release.\nSecond, the Blu-ray version would be a distinct product with its own value proposition. Blu-ray discs offer significantly better image and audio quality than even the best streaming quality Apple offers. Which means there is an additional audience for it.\nI also don't see how this will hurt the streaming service financially. In fact, as far as I can see, it will only help. There's profit in Blu-ray, and even more scope for premium collector's editions that promise fat margins to a boutique collector market.\nThat's without taking into consideration that the Blu-rays themselves are a way to funnel people back to the streaming service that birthed them. The same way Apple is happy to plug their service on the books some of their shows are based on.\nSo Apple, if you want to consider shrinking those losses just a little bit, why not give us more options to give you money? I know you like that."
