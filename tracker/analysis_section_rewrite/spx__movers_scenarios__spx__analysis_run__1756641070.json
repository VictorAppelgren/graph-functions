Ensure every driver references at least one canonical handle (spx or dxy) with a sign and range, and that the catalyst window is clearly tied to a dated event (Fed meeting 2025‑09‑16‑17, Tesla verdict late‑Sept, Marvell earnings mid‑Sept). Keep each line a single sentence, include a probability, and use only the provided IDs for citations. Remove any extraneous wording or duplicated themes; the four items above now satisfy the handle‑mapping, catalyst‑window, magnitude, and probability requirements.",
