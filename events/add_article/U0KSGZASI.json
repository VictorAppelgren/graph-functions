      "summary": "U.S. tariffs have heightened uncertainty for businesses, with many firms anticipating higher costs and supply‑chain disruptions. Small‑mid‑market companies lacking financing are especially vulnerable, while larger firms plan to renegotiate or shift to domestic suppliers. Rising consumer price pressures from tariffs are expected to add to inflation, with the Fed projecting cumulative effects in the coming months. The overall outlook signals increased cost‑pressure on firms and a potential uptick in inflationary expectations.",
