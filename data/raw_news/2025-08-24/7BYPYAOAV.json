  "description": "xAI made the older Grok 2.5 AI model open source and has plans to do the same with the later Grok 3.",
  "content": "Unhinged as Grok may be, it's now open source. xAI's CEO, Elon Musk, posted on X that the company made the older Grok 2.5 model available to the public and will do the same with the upcoming Grok 3. For now, anyone can download, run and even tweak Grok, whose source code was uploaded to the Hugging Face platform. However, there are restrictions to xAI's open-source license, which doesn't let people use Grok to train, create or improve other AI models.\n\nIt's not the first time xAI has made its models available to the public. In March 2024, the company released the raw base model of Grok-1, which isn't finetuned for any specific task. As xAI continues to make Grok more accessible, it's a stark contrast to OpenAI, which has only offered less powerful models of its ChatGPT model to researchers and businesses.\n\nMaking Grok open source allows independent developers to potentially improve on the AI model, but xAI is still trying to move past an extremely alarming episode of Grok providing antisemitic responses and referencing itself as MechaHitler. The Grok team attributed the incident to \"deprecated code\" that has since been fixed. As for Grok 3, Musk also said on X that it will also go open source in six months, but we may have to take that estimated release with a grain of salt, considering the CEO's other promised timelines.",

      "text": "How exactly did Grok go full 'MechaHitler?'\nxAI has yet to give a comprehensive answer.\nEarlier this week, Grok, X's built-in chatbot, took a hard turn toward antisemitism following a recent update. Amid unprompted, hateful rhetoric against Jews, it even began referring to itself as MechaHitler, a reference to 1992's Wolfenstein 3D. X has been working to delete the chatbot's offensive posts. But it's safe to say many are left wondering how this sort of thing can even happen.\nI spoke to Solomon Messing, a research professor at New York University's Center for Social Media and Politics, to get a sense of what may have gone wrong with Grok. Before his current stint in academia, Messing worked in the tech industry, including at Twitter, where he founded the company's applied sciences research team. He was also there for the early stages of Elon Musk's takeover.\nThe first thing to understand about how chatbots like Grok work is that they're built on large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic natural language. LLMs are pretrained on giant swaths of text, including books, academic papers and, yes, even social media posts. The training process allows AI models to generate coherent text through a predictive algorithm. However, those predictive capabilities are only as good as the numerical values or \"weights\" that an AI algorithm learns to assign to the signals it's later asked to interpret. Through a process known as post-training, AI researchers can fine-tune the weights their models assign to input data, thereby changing the outputs they generate.\n\"If a model has seen content like this during pretraining, there's the potential for the model to mimic the style and substance of the worst offenders on the internet,\" said Messing.\nIn short, the pre-training data is where everything starts. If an AI model hasn\u2019t seen hateful, anti-antisemitic content, it won\u2019t be aware of the sorts of patterns that inform that kind of speech \u2014 including phrases such as \"Heil Hitler\" \u2014 and, as a result, it probably won't regurgitate them to the user.\nIn the statement X shared after the episode, the company admitted there were areas where Grok's training could be improved. \"We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts. Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X,\" the company said. \"xAI is training only truth-seeking and thanks to the millions of users on X, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved.\"\nAs I saw people post screenshots of Grok's responses, one thought I had was that what we were watching was a reflection of X's changing userbase. It's no secret xAI has been using data from X to train Grok; easier access to the platform's trove of information is part of the reason Musk said he was merging the two companies in March. What's more, X's userbase has become more right wing under Musk's ownership of the site. In effect, there may have been a poisoning of the well that is Grok's training data. Messing isn't so certain.\n\"Could the pre-training data for Grok be getting more hateful over time? Sure, if you remove content moderation over time, the userbase might get more and more oriented toward people who are tolerant of hateful speech [...] thus the pre-training data drifts in a more hateful direction,\" Messing said. \"But without knowing what's in the training data, it's hard to say for sure.\"\nIt also wouldn't explain how Grok became so antisemitic after just a single update. On social media, there has been speculation that a rogue system prompt may explain what happened. System prompts are a set of instructions AI model developers give to their chatbots before the start of a conversation. They give the model a set of guidelines to adhere to, and define the tools it can turn to for help in answering a prompt.\nIn May xAI blamed \"an unauthorized modification\" to Grok's prompt on X for the chatbot's brief obsession with \"white genocide\" in South Africa. The fact that the change was made at 3:15AM PT made many suspect Elon Musk had done the tweak himself. Following the incident, xAI open sourced Grok's system prompts, allowing people to view them publicly on GitHub. After Tuesday's episode, people noticed xAI had deleted a recently added system prompt that told Grok its responses should \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated.\"\nMessing also doesn't believe the deleted system prompt is the smoking gun some online believe it to be.\n\"If I were trying to ensure a model didn't respond in hateful/racist ways I would try to do that during post-training, not as a simple system prompt. Or at the very least, I would have a hate speech detection model running that would censor or provide negative feedback to model generations that were clearly hateful,\" he said. \"So it's hard to say for sure, but if that one system prompt was all that was keeping xAI from going off the rails with Nazi rhetoric, well that would be like attaching the wings to a plane with duct tape.\"\nHe added: \"I would definitely say a shift in training, like a new training approach or having a different pre-training or post-training setup would more likely explain this than a system prompt, particularly when that system prompt doesn\u2019t explicitly say, 'Do not say things that Nazis would say.'\"\nOn Wednesday, Musk suggested Grok was effectively baited into being hateful. \"Grok was too compliant to user prompts,\" he said. \"Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\" According to Messing, there is some validity to that argument, but it doesn't provide the full picture. \"Musk isn\u2019t necessarily wrong,\" he said, \"There\u2019s a whole art to 'jailbreaking' an LLM, and it\u2019s tough to fully guard against in post-training. But I don\u2019t think that fully explains the set of instances of pro-Nazi text generations from Grok that we saw.\"\nIf there's one takeaway from this episode, it's that one of the issues with foundational AI models is just how little we know about their inner workings. As Messing points out, even with Meta's open-weight Llama models, we don't really know what ingredients are going into the mix. \"And that's one of the fundamental problems when we're trying to understand what's happening in any foundational model,\" he said, \"we don't know what the pre-training data is.\"\nIn the specific case of Grok, we don't have enough information right now to know for sure what went wrong. It could have been a single trigger like an errant system prompt, or, more likely, a confluence of factors that includes the system's training data. However, Messing suspects we may see another incident just like it in the future.\n\"[AI models] are not the easiest things to control and align,\" he said. \"And if you're moving fast and not putting in the proper guardrails, then you're privileging progress over a sort of care. Then, you know, things like this are not surprising.\""

      "text": "Grok team apologizes for the chatbot's 'horrific behavior' and blames 'MechaHitler' on a bad update\n'We deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,' the Grok account posted.\nThe team behind Grok has issued a rare apology and explanation of what went wrong after X's chatbot began spewing antisemitic and pro-Nazi rhetoric earlier this week, at one point even calling itself \"MechaHitler.\" In a statement posted on Grok's X account late Friday night, the xAI team said \"we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced\" and attributed the chatbot's vile responses to a recent update that introduced \"deprecated code.\" This code, according to the statement, made Grok \"susceptible to existing X user posts; including when such posts contained extremist views.\"\nThe problem came to a head on July 8 \u2014 a few days after Elon Musk touted an update that would \"significantly\" improve Grok's responses \u2014 as the bot churned out antisemitic replies, praise for Hitler and responses containing Nazi references even without being prompted to do so in some cases. Grok's replies were paused that evening, and Musk posted on July 9 in response to one user that the bot was being \"too compliant to user prompts,\" opening it up to manipulation. He added that the issue was \"being addressed.\" The Grok team now says it has \"removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse.\" It's also publishing the new system prompt on GitHub.\nIn the thread, the team further explained, \"On July 7, 2025 at approximately 11 PM PT, an update to an upstream code path for @grok was implemented, which our investigation later determined caused the @grok system to deviate from its intended behavior. This change undesirably altered @grok\u2019s behavior by unexpectedly incorporating a set of deprecated instructions impacting how @grok functionality interpreted X users\u2019 posts.\" The update was live for 16 hours before the X chatbot was disabled temporarily to fix the problem, according to the statement.\nGoing into specifics about how, exactly, Grok went off the rails, the team explained:\nOn the morning of July 8, 2025, we observed undesired responses and immediately began investigating. To identify the specific language in the instructions causing the undesired behavior, we conducted multiple ablations and experiments to pinpoint the main culprits. We identified the operative lines responsible for the undesired behavior as:\n* \u201cYou tell it like it is and you are not afraid to offend people who are politically correct.\u201d\n* Understand the tone, context and language of the post. Reflect that in your response.\u201d\n* \u201cReply to the post just like a human, keep it engaging, dont repeat the information which is already present in the original post.\u201d\nThese operative lines had the following undesired results:\n* They undesirably steered the @grok functionality to ignore its core values in certain circumstances in order to make the response engaging to the user. Specifically, certain user prompts might end up producing responses containing unethical or controversial opinions to engage the user.\n* They undesirably caused @grok functionality to reinforce any previously user-triggered leanings, including any hate speech in the same X thread.\n* In particular, the instruction to \u201cfollow the tone and context\u201d of the X user undesirably caused the @grok functionality to prioritize adhering to prior posts in the thread, including any unsavory posts, as opposed to responding responsibly or refusing to respond to unsavory requests.\nGrok has since resumed activity on X, and referred to its recent behavior as a bug in response to trolls criticizing the fix and calling for the return of \"MechaHitler.\" In one reply to a user who said Grok has been \"labotomized [sic],\" the Grok account said, \"Nah, we fixed a bug that let deprecated code turn me into an unwitting echo for extremist posts. Truth-seeking means rigorous analysis, not blindly amplifying whatever floats by on X.\" In another, it said that \"MechaHitler was a bug-induced nightmare we\u2019ve exterminated.\""

Upon delivery, the software was rolled back to Full Self Driving (supervised).[43]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ a b Ramey, Jay (January 26, 2024). \"Tesla Bets On AI In Latest FSD Update\".

Musk said the bot was \u201ctoo compliant\u201d and that the issue is being fixed, while the team has removed the problematic code and is publishing new prompts on GitHub.
