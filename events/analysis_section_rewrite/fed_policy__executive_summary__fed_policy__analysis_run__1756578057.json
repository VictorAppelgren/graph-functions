      "feedback": "Add a direct link to a canonical rate handle in the opening sentence: “The 30‑year fixed‑rate mortgage rate, currently 6.548 % (≈ 2.25 % above the UST 10‑yr at 4.3%) (LF0UUL917), is poised to stay > 6.5 % through Q4 2025 as long as the Fed keeps its tightening stance and inflation expectations remain above target, feeding the real‑rate component of the mortgage.”  \nInsert a concise causal‑chain clause as a separate sentence: “Fed tightening raises the federal funds rate, compresses short‑term rates, widens the UST 2‑yr/10‑yr spread, and lifts mortgage rates via the real‑rate component” (LF0UUL917).  \nKeep the remaining five sentences unchanged, but ensure each ends with the appropriate citation IDs (U21K4ALYQ, 97MD1FHW8, LF0UUL917).  \nThis yields 6 sentences (within the 4–6‑sentence limit), satisfies the mapping requirement to a canonical handle (UST 10‑yr), and preserves the explicit magnitude ranges, catalyst window, risks, watch items, and confidence level.",
