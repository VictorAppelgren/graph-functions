  "title": "'He's trying to piss people off': Some DC residents angry over Trump crackdown",
  "description": "Some DC residents are angry about President Trump's plans to deploy the National Guard and federalize the city's police force. Others like it.",
  "content": "Katherine Ernst was taking an evening stroll on Sunday Aug. 10 around the National Mall when she first noticed an unusual \"buzz\" of law enforcement activity.\n\nErnst, who has worked in Washington, DC for nearly a decade, said it was unsettling to see so many federal law enforcement officers milling about, but she was even more distraught to learn why: Hundreds of federal police officers were deployed around DC hotspots beginning Aug. 7, as part of President Donald Trump's public safety crackdown in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nTrump later ramped up the crackdown, announcing he will deploy 800 National Guard troops to the city and take control of its police force. The moves angered some of those who live and work in the district, but were welcomed by others, a series of USA TODAY interviews suggests.\n\n\"I saw the warnings about the National Guard, and I was like, 'that's a step too far, I don't like that,'\" said Ernst, who was among dozens of people gathered for a protest near the White House on Aug. 11 to oppose Trump's announcement.\n\nTrump has described Washington, DC as unsafe and violent, pointing to recent crimes like the assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer during an attempted carjacking on Aug. 3. While some of those who live in the city expressed similar concerns about crime, others pushed back against Trump's characterization, noting that violent crime in the district is down nearly 30% in 2025 compared to this time last year.\n\n\"It's really just meant to put fear into people, and we're not going to be cowed by him,\" Shelley Moskowitz, who has lived in DC since 1987, said at the protest of Trump's actions. \"We don't need the outside military coming in. We're a very fine and dandy city.\"\n\nOutside the White House, Donna Powell grew visibly frustrated as she was briefly questioned by Secret Service in the August heat. Powell said that in recent weeks, police have been questioning demonstrators more and she fears conflict could erupt now that Trump has mobilized the National Guard.\n\nTrump issued a stern warning to protesters in the city and beyond during the Aug. 11 press briefing in which he declared a public safety emergency in DC, saying \"they're not going to be fighting back long.\"\n\nPowell disagreed. \"He's trying to piss people off, and he's trying to instigate something to occur so that he can justify bringing the National Guard in,\" she said.\n\nPowell also expressed concern about Trump's threat to replicate his approach to DC in other cities including New York, Baltimore and Chicago. She said deploying the National Guard \"did not work\" in Los Angeles, where protesters clashed with police after Trump deployed the National Guard in June.\n\n\"I think the country needs to wake up to what's happening to the country as a whole,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked how she feels about the deployment of National Guard troops, Diane Gronewold had one response: Angry.\n\n\"There's no reason for National Guard to be here,\" said Gronewold, who attended the demonstration with Powell. \"The crime rate is down in DC. There's no trouble.\"\n\nGronewold, who lives just outside the city in Arlington, Virginia, said Mayor Muriel Bowser hasn't been doing enough to counter Trump's threats. During an Aug. 10 appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d Bowser refuted Trump\u2019s claims of rising crime in the city and expressed concern about the National Guard deployment, but said \"that\u2019s the president\u2019s call.\"\n\n\"She's in a horrible position,\" Gronewold said, acknowledging Bowser's limited autonomy. \"But I think that the people of DC would like her to do more, and they're willing to suffer more if she will lead.\"\n\nDespite the decline in violent crime, some residents welcomed the idea of an increased police presence.\n\nThe city is already home to many overlapping law enforcement agencies and local police should be able to work well with the National Guard, said Kevin Schilling, who sat on a bench outside the White House wearing a white Trump hat just after the president made his announcement. Schilling, who lives in DC, said he views crime and homelessness as major issues in the city.\n\n\"I guess it's hard to handle,\" Schilling said.\n\nSarah Kimble, who has been living in parks in the city's Northwest quadrant after being turned away from a homeless shelter, said she often fears for her safety in other parts of the city, citing recent outbursts of gun violence like the shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a museum.\n\n\"How many children have been hurt? I mean, it's crazy,\" she said. \"So, yeah, I'm glad. Something needs to be overseen at least until they get a handle on it.\"\n\nThough Kimble is still trying to secure housing for herself, she also said she doesn't blame the president for wanting to get rid of homeless encampments. Trump said on social media that the homeless in DC would \"have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\" though he did not elaborate on how or where they would go.\n\n\"It is ugly, yeah, so I can get that,\" Kimble said. \"I mean, even if I'm in it, it doesn't mean I like it and I want to stay there.\"",

      "text": "Drastic changes coming to homeless services, new Trump order promises\nTrump wants to lock up people with drug or mental health challenges. Advocates say lack of housing is the real problem.\nThe United States is taking a sharp turn in how it addresses homelessness after President Donald Trump ordered a tough new approach that rejects the longstanding \"housing first\" template.\nTrump, angered by messy encampments of homeless people near the White House and on the nation's streets and parks, declared that organizations receiving federal funding must focus first on locking up people with drug or mental health challenges. Trump has long criticized how the United States manages homelessness, and argues public streets aren't safe for either the homeless or residents.\n\"Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens,\" Trump said in his July 24 order. \"The federal government and the states have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats.\"\nLongtime social workers, medical experts and mental health service providers say the new approach will likely worsen homelessness across the country, particularly because Trump's order contains no new funding for mental health or drug treatment.\nAdditionally, they say the president appears to misunderstand the fundamental driver of homelessness: People can't afford housing.\nThe president's order calls for more \"involuntary commitment,\" which is a process in which mental health workers can forcibly detain and medicate people against their will. Studies have shown that the housing first model is significantly cheaper and more effective than involuntary detention.\n\"Nobody wants people sleeping outside. But if you are someone who doesn't want people sleeping outside, you should vigorously oppose this effort,\" said Dr. Margot Kushel, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and physician at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, who studies unhoused people. \"Americans want there to be no homelessness. And this is literally a formula to worsen homelessness.\"\n'There's tents outside the White House. You can't have that.'\nSupporters of Trump's approach, which was bolstered by a recent Supreme Court ruling, say it's about time police officers were given the go-ahead to vigorously arrest people for drug possession while reducing the risk of human waste and fire hazards posed by the encampments and \"chronic vagancy\" cited by the president.\nLast year, the annual nationwide assessment found that about 770,000 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January. That number includes people living in hotels or shelters, as well as 5,200 individuals still displaced by the 2023 Maui wildfires.\nTrump issued the order a day before flying to Scotland to visit his golf club, and appeared particularly concerned about an encampment near the White House. But it reflects his longstanding frustration with homelessness in the United States.\nDuring his first administration, Trump urged police to \"get tough\" on encampments, and his new executive order goes even further by ordering authorities to expand involuntary detentions and withdraw funding from communities that don't comply with his approach.\n\"When leaders come to see me to make a trade deal for billions and billions and even trillions of dollars and they come and there's tents outside the White House. You can't have that,\" Trump said.\nNationally, many housing and homeless service providers have moved away from routine involuntary commitments, not just because they're expensive but because the practice is widely considered dehumanizing.\n\"The intention here in New York is not to and never should be to warehouse anybody,\" said Patrick Wildes, the director of Albany Law School\u2019s Government Law Center and the former state assistant secretary for human services and mental hygiene. \"The goal is to help them to get well and, in almost every case, help them return to living among their brothers and sisters in society.\"\nLike other experts, Wildes said the housing first model being targeted by Trump, while not perfect, represents the best, most effective way to stabilize people.\n\"When it comes to supporting people who are struggling with serious mental health or substance use disorders, it's been proven time and time again that having a roof over your head gives you a substantially better chance of getting back on your feet,\u201d he said.\n'No funding or mechanisms in place to make this executive order happen.'\nJesse Rabinowitz, a spokesman and social worker for the National Homelessness Law Center, said Trump's focus on encampments reflects the president's own background as a wealthy developer who doesn't support government-supplied affordable housing.\n\"All this does is treat it like a crime to be sick and poor,\" Rabinowitz said.\nThe executive order also mandates significant new data collection about people who receive services, allowing the government to track who has gotten help and where.\nWhile Trump has criticized the amount of money spent on providing shelter for homeless people, advocates say taxpayers have never provided nearly enough to solve the problems caused by the high costs of rent, stagnant salaries for low-wage workers, and a lack of affordable counseling and drug treatment for people without jobs.\nIn Colorado, a study of people served by community-based mental health provider WellPower, the state's largest, found that getting homeless people into supportive housing saved taxpayers more than $3,700 per person annually in costs such as jail and police time. The study found that 77% of people who were given housing first remained in that housing three years later.\nHeidi Eastman, WellPower's vice president of housing and resources, said that while advocates are still trying to understand the full ramifications of Trump's order, it's not clear how fast change will come and where.\n\"There's no funding or mechanisms in place to make this executive order happen,\" said Eastman, a longtime clinical social worker. \"It's going to put a bigger strain on the providers, it's going to overload the system, and it will require more expensive services for people who may not need inpatient hospitalization.\""

      "text": "President, mayor, police chief, social worker. Trump is a man of many hats\nAlongside his Washington, D.C. takeover of local law enforcement, President Trump also vows to clear away the homeless and pave the potholes.\nDonald Trump's expansive view of his powers is no longer limited to those traditionally exercised by a president.\nWith his decision to take control of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department and deploy national guardsmen and FBI agents on the city's streets \u2212 citing a spree of lawlessness that isn't supported by federal crime data \u2212 the president took charge of tasks typically in the domain of the mayor and the police chief.\nThere was more. He also vowed to clear out the homeless from encampments (though short on details about where they would go, exactly) as well as pave the streets and fill the potholes. He is a hands-on leader, he boasted, even when it comes to White House decor and his plans to build a huge ballroom and install new marble floors.\n\"I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" he said at the beginning of a freewheeling news conference that stretched for more than an hour. \"This is Liberation Day in DC, and we're going to take our capital back.\"\nWhy now?\nThat wasn't entirely clear, especially at a time when crime in Washington is on a significant slide.\nIn January, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that violent crime in Washington in 2024 was at a 30-year low, down 35% from 2023. So far this year, DC's police department said that as of Aug. 10, violent crime has dropped another 26%.\nExcept for a spike during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 and 2023, violent crime in the District of Columbia has been steadily declining since 2012.\nTrump was clearly unconvinced, depicting a dystopian landscape outside the White House gates. \"Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,\" he said.\nHe mentioned, in particular, the beating of a former staffer from the Department of Governmental Efficiency during an attempted carjacking. He suggested the reporters in the room, many of whom live in Washington, should be grateful that he was moving to protect them.\nCan Trump do that? Yes. Should he?\nTrump declared a public safety emergency in Washington \u2212 seizing control of the police department and sending 800 national guardsmen on the streets and another 120 FBI agents on night patrols. While critics argued that it wasn't necessary or wise to take these steps, they generally didn't argue that he lacked the power to do them.\n\"He's doing this because he can,\" city councilman Charles Allen said.\nTo be clear, standing on the side of law and order doesn't usually require a profile in courage. It has been a Republican trope since Richard Nixon and before. In recent years, it has been stoked by demands by Democrats and others for social justice reforms in the wake of notorious cases of police brutality.\nTrump depicted crime as a failure of Democratic leaders and a consequence of their policies. He warned other Democratic enclaves \u2212 New York, Chicago, Los Angeles \u2212 that he just might consider taking similar steps to impose order on their streets.\nWhat particularly irked his fiercest critics was the contrast with Trump's action, or his lack of it, during what was undeniably a law-enforcement crisis in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. Thousands of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, disrupting the ceremonial count of Electoral College ballots and sending senators and representatives scrambling for safety.\nThen, Trump didn't deploy the National Guard. Afterward, more than 1,575 people were charged with crimes. At least 600 were charged with the felony of assaulting or impeding law enforcement. Trump himself was also indicted on criminal charges for trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election that he lost \u2013 a prosecution he managed to avoid facing trial on by winning the presidency again.\nOn the first day of his second term, Trump granted a blanket clemency to the Jan. 6 defendants.\nDurbin: 'Political theater' to draw attention from Jeffrey Epstein\nThis time, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin called Trump's actions \"political theater\" and \"a typical move by this president to create chaos and uncertainty, and to draw the attention from other issues like Jeffrey Epstein.\" Trump was \"trying to change the subject,\" said Durbin, one of the top Democrats who oversees the Department of Justice.\nTrump did answer questions from reporters about the traditional business of the presidency. He discussed his vision of a \"land swap\" he might negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their scheduled meeting on Aug. 15 in Alaska to end the war in Ukraine. He said he would soon decide whether to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, and he teased the ongoing trade negotiations with China.\nThen, yes, there was Epstein, the deceased financier and convicted child sex offender whose case had broken back into the headlines just before Trump walked out into the White House briefing room. A federal judge denied the Trump administration's request to release testimony in the grand jury that indicted Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former partner, who is serving her own 20-year prison sentence on sex trafficking charges.\nThe request was part of the administration's effort to tamp down a swirling controversy among Trump's MAGA base about whether there was a conspiracy to protect powerful people from disclosure.\nAs he left the briefing room, the president ignored shouted questions about the case \u2212 though like the new crackdown on crime, that topic isn't likely to go away anytime soon."

      "text": "Pentagon pulls 2,000 National Guard members from Los Angeles in immigration rollback\nWASHINGTON \u2015 The Trump administration is pulling half of the California National Guard members it deployed to Los Angeles in a major rollback of President Donald Trump's militarized response to protests in Southern California over immigration arrests and raids.\n\u201cThanks to our troops who stepped up to answer the call, the lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding,\" Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a July 15 statement. \"As such, the Secretary has ordered the release of 2,000 California National Guardsmen (79th IBCT) from the federal protection mission.\"\nTrump deployed 4,000 California National Guardsmen on June 7 to respond to protests that racked the southern part of the state after he stepped up immigration raids and arrests, targeting farms, restaurants, and hardware stores across the Los Angeles area. He also ordered 700 Marines to the city that were tasked with guarding federal property.\nThe deployment was decried by the state's Democratic lawmakers, who have called an overreach of presidential authority and accused Trump of inciting violence. Trump has claimed that the \"Los Angeles would be burning right now\" if not for the military presence.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who sued the Trump administration over the guard's deployment, called for Trump to release the remaining National Guard members from Los Angeles now that half have been pulled.\n\u201cWhile nearly 2,000 of them are starting to demobilize, the remaining guards members continue without a mission, without direction and without any hopes of returning to help their communities,\u201d Newsom said in a statement Tuesday. We call on Trump and the Department of Defense to end this theater and send everyone home now.\u201d\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass claimed victory after Trump's withdrawal of guardsmen.\n\u201cThis happened because the people of Los Angeles stood united and stood strong,\" Bass said in a statement. \"We organized peaceful protests, we came together at rallies, we took the Trump administration to court \u2012 all of this led to today\u2019s retreat.\"\nBass added: \"We will not stop making our voices heard until this ends, not just here in LA, but throughout our country.\u201d\nOne National Guard brigade is being withdrawn from Los Angeles, according to a Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly. About one brigade, with several thousand soldiers, remains.\nAn appeals court ruled in June that Trump could keep control over the National Guard troops.\nTrump, upon his return Tuesday night to the White House after traveling to Pittsburgh, did not respond to a shouted question from a reporter about his decision to pull the guardsmen from Los Angeles."

Last year, 40% of homeless people slept under bridges, on sidewalks, in parks, cars, and abandoned buildings.\nWASHINGTON \u2212 The Supreme Court ruled Friday that people without homes can be arrested and fined for sleeping in public spaces, overturning a lower court\u2019s ruling that enforcing camping bans when shelter is lacking is cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe 6-3 decision was the most significant ruling on the issue from the high court in decades.\nIt comes as record numbers of Americans lack permanent housing and as both Democratic and Republican leaders have complained a 2018 decision by a lower court has hamstrung their ability to address homeless encampments that threaten health and public safety.\n\u201cThe Court cannot say that the punishments Grants Pass imposes here qualify as cruel and unusual,\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority, referring to the small Oregon municipality at the center of the case.\n\u201cThe city imposes only limited fines for first-time offenders, an order temporarily barring an individual from camping in a public park for repeat offenders, and a maximum sentence of 30 days in jail for those who later violate an order.\u201d\nCruel and unusual punishment?\nBut Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the court's liberal minority, said the laws essentially criminalized the act of sleeping.\n\u201cSleep is a biological necessity, not a crime,\u201d Sotomayor wrote in dissent, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. \u201cFor some people, sleeping outside is their only option.\u201d\nSotomayor noted that Grants Pass jails and fines people who sleep in public, such as in a car, or for using as little as a blanket to keep warm or a rolled-up shirt as a pillow. \u201cFor people with no access to shelter, that punishes them for being homeless,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is unconscionable and unconstitutional.\u201d\nAnn Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said the decision gives \u201cfree reign to local officials who prefer pointless and expensive arrests and imprisonment, rather than real solutions.\u201d\n\u201cThis tactic has consistently failed to reduce homelessness in the past,\u201d Oliva said, \u201cand it will assuredly fail to reduce homelessness in the future.\u201d\n`Urgent relief' to communities\nTheane Evangelis, who represented Grants Pass, said the decision brought \u201curgent relief to the many communities that have struggled to address the growing problem of dangerous encampments.\u201d\n\u201cFor the past six years, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decisions have tied the hands of local governments,\u201d Evangelis said. \u201cThe Court has now restored the ability of cities on the frontlines of this crisis to develop lasting solutions that meet the needs of the most vulnerable members of their communities, while also keeping our public spaces safe and clean.\u201d\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees nine Western states, ruled in 2018 that banning camping in areas lacking sufficient shelter beds amounts to cruel and unusual punishment under the 8th Amendment.\nThe Supreme Court declined to weigh in at the time on that case from Boise, Idaho, but took up the issue this term after that precedent was used to challenge anti-camping rules in Grants Pass.\nHomeless residents of the southern Oregon city of 38,000 had faced fines starting at $250 and leading to jail time for repeat offenses.\nCriminalizing homelessness in a city without a homeless shelter\nAdvocates for homeless people said the rules amounted to criminalizing someone for having nowhere to live. The city lacks sufficient affordable housing. The one shelter for adults requires attending daily Christian services and other rules. Hundreds of residents are unhoused.\n\"We don't want to be in the parks,\" said Helen Cruz, a Grants Pass resident who lacks permanent shelter. \"We want a place to live.\"\nCity officials said without the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention, they would be forced to surrender their public spaces.\nThe Department of Justice had mostly backed the challengers while also arguing that the appeals court ruling was too broad and didn\u2019t take into account individual circumstances such as whether someone had access to a shelter and refused it.\nOn any given night in the United States, more than 600,000 people are likely to be homeless, according to the federal government. Last year, 40% of homeless individuals slept under bridges, on sidewalks, in parks, cars, abandoned buildings and other public locations.\nThe case, which is the City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, attracted an unusually large number of briefs filed by outside interests.\nAdvocates for the homeless hoped that even if the decision didn't go their way, the case would spur elected officials at all levels of government to do more to address homelessness."

Trump cited the law in an executive order declaring he was using emergency powers to seize control of the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cThe Home Rule charter requires the mayor to provide the services of MPD during special conditions of an emergency, and we will follow the law,\u201d Bowser.\n-Zac Anderson\nDOJ earlier said DC violent crime was at a 30-year low\nDespite claims of rising crime and violence in Washington by President Trump and his attorney general and FBI chief, the Justice Department itself announced in January that total violent crime for 2024 was down 35% from the year before.\nIn fact, crime in the capital \u201cis the lowest it has been in over 30 years,\u201d according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department included in a Jan. 3 statement by the Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\nThen-U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, credited the declines to a \"focus on the drivers of violence \u2212 those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed.\u201d\nDuring an August 11 press conference, DC was described as one of the most unsafe and violent cities in the world by Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Graves\u2019 recently confirmed replacement, former television personality Jeanine Pirro.\nBut the Justice Department in January said that in addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides were down 32%; robberies were down 39%; armed carjackings were down 53% and assaults with a dangerous weapon were down 27% when compared with 2023 levels. DOJ also said the District was reporting \u201cthe fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\u201d\nIn 2024, Washington, DC,had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says on police response to protesters: \u2018You spit and we hit\u2019\nPresident Trump issued a stern warning to protesters in Washington, DC, and beyond during his Aug. 11 press briefing where he announced plans to federalize the city's police force and deploy National Guard troops: \u201cYou spit and we hit.\u201d\nIn making the remark, Trump said that he was aware of a recent incident in Navy Yard, a neighborhood located in southeast DC. Police arrested a minor on Aug. 9 who discharged a firearm at a group of teens, according to ABC 7 News.\nNavy Yard has seen other incidents of violence in the past, including fights breaking out among teens and a 25-year-old arrested and charged with assault on a police officer.\n\u201cThey're not going to be fighting back long,\u201d Trump said,\nApparently recalling previous street protests were officers showed restraint against demonstrators, Trump called on officers to use force.\n\u201cThey love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform, they're standing and they're screaming at them an inch away from their face, and then they start spitting in their face.

And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm gonna see Putin. I'm going to Russia on Friday. I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capitol was with graffiti all over the walls.\u201d\nThe leaders are scheduled to meet on Aug. 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the three-year Russian war on Ukraine, in the first in-person meeting since Trump took office for his second term.\n\u2212Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\nTrump puts new DEA chief in charge of DC police\nTrump announced that Drug Enforcement Administrator Terrance Cole will take over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be designated as the interim federal commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department, okay?\u201d Trump told Cole, standing on the stage with him. \u201cAnd you run them tough, they're good.

Mike Lee: Time to take over DC\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said now is the time for Congress to take control of the city.\n\u201cWe should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,\u201d Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\nThe legislation, dubbed \u201cBringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident\u201d was introduced earlier this year, and was named after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption.\nLee cited an ongoing scandal, for example, involving a D.C. police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats in his district. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime for fear of reprisal.\n\u2212Phillip M. Bailey, Deborah Berry\nWhite House says DC\u2019s murder rate leads other national capitals\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, White House officials handed a chart to reporters in the press briefing room detailing how Washington D.C.\u2019s homicide rate is greater than those of several foreign capitals.\nWith about 27 murders per every 100,000 residents, Washington, D.C., has a higher homicide rate than Bogota, Colombia; Mexico City; Islamabad, Pakistan; Lima, Peru; and Ottawa, Canada, among others, according to the chart.\nEven so, violent crime in Washington D.C. is down 26% in 2025 compared to this time last year. In 2024, Washington, D.C., had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit, at 27.3 per 100,000 residents, a decline of 30.7% from 2023.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump's expected troop deployment recalls 2020 protest crackdown\nPresident Trump's expected announcement that he will send the military onto the streets of the nation's capital recalls his deployment of National Guard troops during his first term to suppress protests sparked by the police murder of George Floyd.\nTrump has threatened a massive crackdown on crime in Washington.\nNational Guard troops mobilized by the president in a \"federalized\" capacity are typically barred from carrying out the functions of law enforcement, but not if they're under state control. In the summer of 2020, Trump brought troops into Washington from other states under the permission of 11 governors \u2212 an unprecedented mobilization of state troops.\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nDemocrats ask: What about Jan. 6?\nAhead of Trump's press conference, Democrats criticized Trump for failing to call in the National Guard during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, while preparing to call in the military now to suppress street crime.\nMore than 1,575 people were charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection. At least 600 were charged with the felony of assaulting or impeding law enforcement, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\u201cRemember January 6, 2021: Why did Trump fail to call out to DC National Guard? Don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s lies,\u201d Donna Brazile, former acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, wrote on X.\nWashington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department.\n-Sudiksha Kochi, Josh Meyer and Zac Anderson\nNo DC crime surge, mayor says\nA spokesman for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to comment ahead of Trump\u2019s news conference.\nBut during an Aug. 10 appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d Bowser pushed back at Trump\u2019s claims of rising crime in Washington. \u201cWe are not experiencing a crime spike,\u201d the mayor said.\nBowser expressed concern about sending the National Guard into the capital, noting that Guard troops are not meant to enforce local laws.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about them not being used efficiently. And I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our guard,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the president\u2019s call about how to deploy the guard.\u201d\nBowser, who is in her third mayoral term, has refrained from responding with hostility to Trump\u2019s threats about taking over Washington.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n450 federal officers deployed on DC streets\nTrump's announcement comes as 450 officers from multiple federal agencies were deployed in high-traffic D.C. areas and other hotspots over the weekend on Aug. 9 and 10.\nThe officers are from 18 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Secret Service.\nTrump ordered an increased law enforcement presence in D.C. on Aug. 8 after complaining about crime in the city, even as violent crime trended down.\nViolent crime is down 26% in DC in 2025\nThe White House pointed to several examples of violent crime in Washington this year including the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum (The suspect is from Chicago.) as well as the recent assault on Coristine.\nYet Washington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Violent crime declined by 35% in Washington from 2023 ro 2024, including homicides from 274 to 187.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump threatens to take over DC\nTrump has long denigrated Washington, D.C, which leans heavily Democratic. Last week, Trump threatened to take over governance of the district if the crime situation isn't improved \u2012 something he floated previously in February.\n\"If D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore,\" Trump said in an Aug. 5 post on Truth Social.\nSuch action would require approval by Congress.\nThe District of Columbia is a federal enclave under jurisdiction of the U.S. government. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gave the city local governance, including an elected mayor and city council. Two congressional Republicans, Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, this month introduced legislation to repeal the Home Rule Act.\n-Joey Garrison\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

He said he plans to look at New York City next \"and if we need to, we're going to do the same thing in Chicago.\"\nIn a separate executive order, Trump invoked authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington\u2019s police department.

After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\nTrump reeled off a list of recent violent crimes in Washington, D.C. to justify his actions. Yet, volent crimes so far in 2025 are down 26% compared to last year, and homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Similarly, homicides in New York City are down in 2025 compared to the same time last year.\nMayors push back at Trump's threat\nAn FBI report released Aug. 5 found violent crime in 2024 dropped by 4.5% in the United States compared to 2023, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by nearly 15%.\nThe U.S. Conference of Mayors, which represents about 1,400 mayors, responded to Trump's actions and threats by touting a \"nationwide success story\" of plummeting crime rates.\n\"Ultimately, the best public safety outcomes are delivered by local police departments and local officials, who know the communities,\" Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, president of the mayors' conference, said in a statement. \"America\u2019s mayors never see takeovers by other levels of government as a tactic that has any track record of producing results.\"\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, in response to Trump singling out his city, said \"Baltimore is the safest it's been in over 50 years,\" adding that homicides are down about 28% in 2025.\n\"We still have real work to do to build on this progress,\" Scott said in a statement, \"but that work starts and ends here in Baltimore, with the local, state, and federal partners who have gotten us this far.\"\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman of USA TODAY\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

The report said officers immediately got out of the car when they saw the incident, and the kids ran away.\nCoristine, who worked for one of Elon Musk's companies before he joined DOGE, became an infamous government staffer because of a colorful nickname he once used online. Musk left the government in May, and many of his staffers joined other areas of the government.\nCoristine told police that he saw the suspects approach the vehicle and make a comment about taking it, according to the police report. He was with his significant other, whom he pushed into the car for her safety before turning to deal with the suspects, who started assaulting him, the police report said.\nPresident Donald Trump posted a photo on social media Tuesday afternoon of a bloodied, shirtless man, whom other news outlets have identified as Coristine, along with criticism of crime committed by kids in Washington, D.C.\n\"Crime in Washington, D.C., is totally out of control,\" Trump wrote. \"Local 'youths' and gang members, some only 14, 15, and 16-years-old, are randomly attacking, mugging, maiming, and shooting innocent Citizens.\"\nThe police report does not indicate that Coristine was shot.\n\"If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City,\" Trump wrote.\nLocal prosecutions are handled primarily by the U.S. Attorney's office for Washington, D.C.

      "text": "As LA tensions flare, anti-ICE protests crop up nationwide\nAs protests in Los Angeles over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown prepare to enter their fifth day, demonstrations have sprung up in major cities around the country.\nDemonstrations were reported by local news outlets and police departments in at least a dozen cities that included San Francisco, New York, Washington, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta in recent days. The protests assembled outside courthouses and local immigration agency offices and in a few instances led to arrests.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement is carrying out a directive from President Donald Trump to find immigrants living in the United States without legal status. Protests have sprung up against the sweeps the agency is carrying out in various neighborhoods. Most have remained peaceful, but a few escalated into clashes with police.\nThe protests in Los Angeles have also ignited a showdown between the federal government and local leaders including California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Trump activated 4,000 National Guard members and hundreds of U.S. Marines despite objections by Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\nAnti-ICE protests spread coast-to-coast\nDemonstrations across the country cropped up to oppose ICE raids, while others gathered in counties neighboring Los Angeles.\nSome of the protests were launched by union members in response to the arrest of David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union California (SEIU), in Los Angeles on June 6. Huerta was arrested and charged with felony conspiracy to impede an officer while protesting, with federal prosecutors saying he impeded agents from accessing a worksite suspected of employing undocumented immigrants by sitting in front of the only entrance.\nMore than 200 union members and supporters in Boston gathered outside City Hall on June 9, NPR affiliate WBUR reported. In Washington, D.C., hundreds gathered outside the Department of Justice and FBI buildings and marched through the city protesting both ICE raids and Huerta's arrest, according to WUSA9.\n\"I'm out here today because I'm angry about what's going on in our government,\" Eileen Duffey, a protester in Philadelphia, told the station WPVI.\nArrests were made at some of the protests. In Dallas, one person was arrested after police declared a demonstration unlawful, CBS News Texas reported. The protest started out peacefully, but later in the evening a firework exploded near police, the outlet said. In Austin, Texas, police fired less-lethal munitions and detained several people as they clashed with a crowd of several hundred protesters.\nMore than 30 were arrested in New York City on June 9 with more protests expected June 10, ABC 7 reported. Among those arrested in New York were about two dozen arrested from the lobby of Trump Tower, the outlet reported.\nProtests turn to clashes with police in Los Angeles\nProtests began on June 6 in response to the Trump administration's crackdown with immigration raids in Southern California. They have been mostly peaceful, and began after ICE sweeps in and around Los Angeles resulted in more than 40 arrests. Tensions flared between protesters and police, turning chaotic and sometimes violent.\nMost of the unrest is taking place across a few square miles in a mostly commercial area downtown. On June 9, LAPD said protesters threw objects at officers near the federal courthouse, prompting use of gas canisters and other munitions. Bass said over 100 people were arrested Monday night, blaming \"fringe groups\" for violence. More protests are expected June 10, the fifth day of demonstrations.\nA tense standoff also unfolded between the administration and California authorities, who say the use of the National Guard and U.S. Marines is an unlawful subversion of Newsom's authority. Bass called Trump's escalation of military presence a \"deliberate attempt to create disorder and chaos in our city.\"\nContributing: Thao Nguyen and John Bacon, USA TODAY; Reuters"

      "text": "'This is an emergency': 5 takeaways after Trump deploys troops in DC, takes over police\nPresident Donald Trump laid out an aggressive plan for the federal government to take over law enforcement in Washington and teased that the same force might be coming to other cities across the country.\nJoined by top administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the president announced the National Guard will be deployed in the nation's capital and that the local police will be placed under federal control.\n\"This is an emergency,\" Trump said. \"This is a tragic emergency.\"\nThe president painted a dark portrait of the city throughout an Aug. 11 press conference, describing it as overrun by homeless people, drug addicts and other \"bloodthirsty criminals\" that his administration will no longer tolerate.\nMany residents and activists have long resisted those characterizations as false and racially motivated attacks against the city, which has lobbied for statehood in recent years.\nMayor Muriel Bowser pushed back at the president's claims of rising crime over the weekend, saying residents \"are not experiencing a crime spike.\" She underscored the need for D.C. statehood during a separate press conference on Aug. 11 hours after Trump's comments.\n\"We are American citizens. Our families go to war, we pay taxes and we uphold the responsibilities of citizenship,\" Bowser said. \"And while this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised.\"\nBut Trump and his allies have been keen on spotlighting individual violent crimes against reporters, White House aides and congressional staffers that often seize headlines and startle tourists.\nDemocrats and other critics pointed out that Washington's homicide rate is down 32% year-to-date, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. They called Trump's move another abuse of his executive authority.\nHere are key takeaways from Trump's press conference.\nTrump administration taking over DC police\nTrump signed two executive orders, the first invoking the 1973 Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume control of Washington police for 48 hours if they determine \"that special conditions of an emergency nature exist...\"\nSuch a takeover can be extended with congressional approval but any request of more than 30 days must be passed into law.\nIn a separate order, Trump ordered Hegseth to deploy National Guard troops in Washington, which also authorized him to work with governors of other states to utilize their guard as well.\nKey officials within the administration are now being tasked with overseeing DC's law enforcement agencies, including Bondi, who will take command of the local Metropolitan Police Department. Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Terry Cole, who was sworn in last month, will serve as interim federal commissioner of the police department.\nWhite House spotlights DOGE staffer and other crime victims\nDuring the press conference, Trump sprinkled in many individual cases of violent crime that he argued justified his takeover, such as the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum.\nOne at the top of mind was the assault of Edward Coristine, who worked as a staffer with the Department of Government Efficiency. An Aug. 3 police report, obtained by USA TODAY, said officers observed a group of about 10 juveniles surrounding Coristine's car and assaulting him around 3 a.m.\n\"He was left dripping in blood,\" Trump said. \"He thought he was dead, with a broken nose and concussion. Can't believe that he's alive. He can't believe it.\"\nThe president also evoked Phillip Todd, a former aide to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who was stabbed in 2023. Trump described the attacker, identified by police as Glynn Neal, as a \"demented lunatic.\"\nIn an August profile by The Washington Post, Todd, a son of Christian missionaries, said that he had forgiven Neal and was rethinking his views on crime and punishment.\nChicago, other cities could see federal oversight, Trump warns\nWhile ticking off individual cases, Trump noted that his Washington takeover might be brought to cities including Chicago; Baltimore; Los Angeles and Oakland, California.\nThose Democratic-controlled cities and states, Trump said, have adopted left-leaning policies, such \"no cash bail\" rules, that he blamed for violent crime.\n\"This issue directly impacts the functioning of the federal government, and is a threat to America, really,\" he said. \"It's a threat to our country. We have other cities also that are bad, very bad.\"\nChicago was in the news earlier this summer for a historic drop in crime that Mayor Brandon Johnson, who Trump called out during the press conference, has touted.\n\"This reduction in hate crimes and of violence generally is a testament to what\u2019s possible when we invest in people and community safety in a holistic way,\" Johnson said in a July 18 statement that credited \"strategic, constitutional policing\" and \"jobs for young people, access to mental health care, and housing people can afford.\"\nSimilar trends have occurred in Baltimore, which has seen a 24% decrease in homicides and an 18% decline in nonfatal shootings, according to Mayor Brandon Scott.\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, the Democratic Mayor's Association said federal intervention isn't needed and argued the president is looking to create a \"political charade\" to distract voters.\n\"Let's be clear: Crime is down in most major cities \u2212 including Washington, DC \u2212 in spite of Donald Trump, not because of him,\" the group said. \"If Trump actually cared about reducing crime, he wouldn't have made unprecedented cuts to public safety programs that actually work.\"\nCongress' takeover of Washington could come next\nTrump's crackdown in Washington could be followed by further changes, specifically to its home rule status, which is often a favorite punching bag for congressional Republicans.\nAhead of the president's press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, declared that now is the time for lawmakers to take control of the city.\n\"We should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,\u201d Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\nThe bill, dubbed \u201cBringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident\u201d was introduced earlier this year, and was named after Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption in the city.\nLee co-sponsored the measure with Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tennessee, and cited an ongoing scandal involving a Washington police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime.\nTrump appeared to allude to the Ogles-Lee proposal to rescind home rule. \"We're going to change the statue, and I'm going to have to get the Republicans to vote, because the Democrats are weak on crime,\" he said.\nDemocrats point fingers on DC statehood while others focus on Trump\nNational Democrats took a few swings at Trump's declaration, casting it as a political ploy more than a fight to improve public safety.\n\"The most violent cities are in Republican states \u2212 and there's no takeover happening there,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, a rumored 2028 presidential contender, said in a post on X. \"This is just another attempt to distract from Trump's corruption and suppress dissent.\"\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former Democratic vice presidential nominee, described Trump's announcement in stark terms, saying on X: \"The road to authoritarianism is littered with people telling you you\u2019re overreacting.\"\nBut some Democrats said the party failed to protect Washington when it had the chance four years ago when Joe Biden was still president and they ran Congress.\n\"Trump is going to federalize D.C.,\" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-California, said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\n\"Senate Dems could have stopped this when we had power,\" he added \"In 2021, the House voted to make D.C. a state, but a few Senate Dems flinched and genuflected to the filibuster. Now, DC will be under an aspiring dictator\u2019s control.\""

      "text": "Capital Jewish Museum Shooting: Couple slain as they exited DC Jewish community event\nTwo Israeli embassy staff members in Washington were fatally shot on May 21 as they exited the Capital Jewish Museum, authorities and officials said.\nPolice received calls reporting a shooting shortly after 9 p.m. ET, Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said at a news conference. Responding officers discovered one man and one woman unconscious and not breathing at the scene.\n\"D.C. fire and EMS responded, and despite all life-saving efforts, both victims succumbed to their injuries,\" Smith said.\nA preliminary investigation indicates that the victims were exiting an event at the Capitol Jewish Museum located in Washington when the shooting occurred, according to Smith. Investigators believe one shooter was behind the attack.\nThe suspect, identified as Elias Rodriguez, 30, of Chicago, was observed pacing back and forth outside the museum before the shooting, Smith said. Rodriguez then approached a group of four people and opened fire, striking the two victims.\nRodriguez later entered the museum and was detained by event security, according to Smith. When taken into custody, Rodriguez shouted \"Free, free Palestine,\" Smith added.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser decried the shooting, noting the incident will instill fear among the community and people across the country.\n\"I want to be clear that we will not tolerate this violence or hate in our city,\" Bowser said during the news conference. \"We will not tolerate any acts of terrorism, and we're going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send a clear message that we will not tolerate antisemitism.\"\nWatch moment suspected gunman in attack on Israeli embassy staff arrested:\nIsraeli embassy spokesperson: Staff members were shot at 'close range'\nWhen asked if authorities were aware of any threats, Smith said police did not receive \"any intelligence with respect to any type of terrorist act or hate crime in our city.\"\nThe FBI field office in Washington said it was at the scene with the Metropolitan Police Department. The agency noted that there is no ongoing threat to public safety.\nTal Naim Cohen, a spokesperson for the Israeli embassy, said on X that two staff members were shot at \"close range\" while attending a Jewish event at the Capital Jewish Museum, a historical society and museum that focuses on the history of the Jewish experience in Washington D.C. and the surrounding metropolitan areas.\n\"We have full faith in law enforcement authorities on both the local and federal levels to apprehend the shooter and protect Israel\u2019s representatives and Jewish communities throughout the United States,\" Cohen said.\nYechiel Leiter, Israeli ambassador to the United States, said the two victims killed were a \"young couple about to be engaged.\"\n\"The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,\" Leiter said at the news conference. \"They were a beautiful couple who came to enjoy an evening in Washington's cultural center.\"\nTrump: 'Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA'\nPresident Donald Trump took to social media and suggested the killings were driven by antisemitism.\n\"These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW!\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen! God Bless You ALL!\"\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog said on social media that he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the scenes in Washington.\n\u201cThis is a despicable act of hatred, of antisemitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy,\u201d Herzog said. \"Our hearts are with the loved ones of those murdered and our immediate prayers are with the injured. I send my full support to the Ambassador and all the embassy staff.\u201d\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on X that federal authorities are investigating the incident.\n\"Two Israeli Embassy staff were senselessly killed tonight near the Jewish Museum in Washington DC,\" Noem. \"Please pray for the families of the victims. We will bring this depraved perpetrator to justice.\"\nDanny Danon, Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, condemned the shooting.\n\"Harming diplomats and the Jewish community is crossing a red line,\u201d Danon said on X. \u201cWe are confident that the US authorities will take strong action against those responsible for this criminal act. Israel will continue to act resolutely to protect its citizens and representatives \u2013 everywhere in the world.\u201d\nThe Jewish Federation of Greater Washington said in a statement that the organization is horrified by the shooting and \"mourn the loss of the two individuals killed in the attack.\"\n\"Our hearts are with their families and loved ones, and with all of those who are impacted by this tragic act of antisemitic violence,\" the federation said, adding that it was working with law enforcement and other Jewish organizations to \"gain a fuller picture of what transpired.\"\nShooting comes amid ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas\nThe shooting comes amid growing criticism against Israel after it announced plans to intensify its military campaign against Hamas and to control Gaza, which has been devastated by air and ground operations.\nMore than 53,000 people have been killed and nearly all residents in Gaza have been displaced since the start of the war, according to local health authorities.\nThe war has increased tensions between Israel and much of the international community. Incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia have also surged across the United States, putting law enforcement agencies on high alert.\n(This story was updated to add new information and video.)"

      "text": "Why doesn't Washington have a governor like states do?\nWashington, D.C. is a district not a state. It does have a mayor, but is still largely controlled by the federal government.\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to send National Guard troops to Washington and put the Metro Washington Police Department under direct federal control comes in part because of the city's unique status as a district, rather than a state.\nTrump made the announcement in a August 11 press conference, saying the move is intended to bring down crime in the city. According to crime statistics from the Metropolitan Police Department released August 11, show that violent crime in the city is down 26% from 2024.\nWhy doesn't Washington have a governor like states do?\nWashington is a district, not a state, so it doesn't have a governor. For most of it's history it didn't have control over its own budget or affairs. Instead, U.S. Congress and the president both play some of the roles managing the district that a governor would.\nIn 1973, Congress gave locals some authority with the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allowed citizens to elect a Mayor and Council.\nBut, Congress still reviews all legislation passed by the Council before it can become law and has authority over the District\u2019s budget. The president appoints District judges, and citizens have a delegate in the House who cannot vote rather than a representative.\nTrump cited Section 740 of the Home Rule Act in taking control of the police department.\nWho is Mayor Muriel Bowser?\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser is the district's seventh elected mayor. She was elected in 2015 after serving as an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner from 2004 to 2006 and as a Member of the D.C. Council from 2007 to 2015.\nBowser and Trump clashed during his first term, but so far have had a cordial relationship in his second term.\nOn Aug. 8 she pushed back on Trump's claims that rising crime warranted the federal government taking over law enforcement in the city, but acknowledged that he can.\n\"We are not experiencing a crime spike,\" she said on MSNBC's \"The Weekend.\" \"The President is very aware of our efforts. He established a task force, which our police department and agencies support with information and anything else they ask us for. ... It is always the President's prerogative to use federal law enforcement or the National Guard.\""
