  "description": "Key PointsFord\u2019s long history, which spans more than 120 years, has made it a symbol of American industry.",
  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Ford\u2019s long history, which spans more than 120 years, has made it a symbol of American industry.\n\u2022 None One of the biggest criticisms of Ford\u2019s operations is that demand will always be cyclical, as sales will ebb and flow with the economy.\n\u2022 None The stock is cheap, and the dividend yield is high, but investors won\u2019t achieve huge returns.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Ford Motor Company \u203a\n\nFord (NYSE: F) is a rare business because it's been around for so long. Having been founded in 1903, the automaker has been an important part of the American economy. And its ongoing relevance shows just how successful it has been in its industry.\n\nThis auto stock is having a great year thus far. As of Aug. 19, it's up 17% in 2025. But can Ford turn its investors into millionaires over the long term? Here's what you should know about the Detroit car company.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nLooking at Ford's business under the hood\n\nWith a history that spans more than 120 years, Ford has built up brand awareness simply from being around for such a long time. This brand recognition is also supported by the fact that the company's F-series pickups have been the best-selling trucks in the U.S. for 48 straight years. That's an unbelievable track record.\n\nHowever, I think a deeper look at this company will reveal that it's not a high-quality operation that investors will want to own for a long time. There are some key reasons why.\n\nFord isn't going to post strong revenue growth consistently. Unit volumes were up 14.2% in the U.S. in the second quarter (ended June 30), thanks to significant demand during Ford's employee-pricing program to boost sales amid trade and tariff uncertainties. This pace isn't sustainable. Between 2014 and 2024, Ford's top line increased at a compound annual rate of just 2.5%, a trend that seems likely to continue going forward.\n\nThe global auto industry is very mature in the sense that unit volumes won't increase in any meaningful way on a yearly basis. Ford is making a push into electric vehicles, a part of the industry with potential, but this specific segment posted a $1.3 billion operating loss in Q2.\n\nCyclicality is another reason that investors should tread with caution. Cars are huge buying decisions for consumers, as opposed to being small, repeat purchases. This makes Ford's demand highly sensitive to economic forces. If there's a mild downturn or even a severe recession, sales could face significant pressure.\n\nAs a result, Ford's low profitability, as demonstrated by its Q2 adjusted operating margin of 4.3% and adjusted return on invested capital of 10.1%, will take a hit. In fact, it wouldn't be a surprise to see the business post a net loss in an adverse economic scenario. Ford's profitability leaves much to be desired, and it's yet another reason this isn't a great company.\n\nIn the past decade, Ford shares have generated a total return of just 33% (as of Aug. 19). At the same time, the S&P 500 index produced a total return of 267%. This disappointing track record adds fuel to the argument above that Ford isn't a high-quality company. A smart rule of thumb to follow generally is that good businesses should produce returns that beat the market over the long term.\n\nThis stock won't make investors rich. The chance for investors to achieve meaningful capital appreciation is very low, in my opinion. Owning Ford provides much less upside than owning a competitively advantaged technology stock, like Alphabet, for example, that registers strong earnings growth over the long run.\n\nBut if you're someone who likes to generate income from the stocks in your portfolio, then Ford might fit the bill. The current dividend yield is a hefty 5.18%.\n\nAnd if paying a cheap valuation is something you prioritize, then Ford stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10.3 might be an attractive proposition. It's worth mentioning, though, that betting on a quick gain from the valuation multiple expanding isn't really a game that long-term investors should be playing.\n\nFord is a symbol of American industrialism, but it's not a millionaire-making stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ford Motor Company wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $649,657!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,090,993!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,057% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nNeil Patel has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

      "text": "The automotive industry is huge and very visible. Almost everyone knows automotive brands, and most people have an opinion about the best new cars and trucks on the market.\nBecause of that visibility, automotive stocks have gotten lots of interest from investors for decades. We\u2019ll look more closely at automotive stocks and the best ways to invest in them.\nTop car stocks\nTop car stocks of 2025\nSome of the best-known automotive stocks are:\n| Automotive company | About |\n|---|---|\n| Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Investors know this automaker as a longtime market leader in pickup trucks and commercial vehicles, with operations all over the world. Ford is now investing in electric and automated vehicles to help it maintain that lead. However, relatively high interest rates have held back EV growth in recent years, and Ford is focusing on reducing costs and EV capacity to try to make its EVs profitable. |\n| Ferrari NV (NYSE:RACE) | This small Italian automaker is known for its expensive sports cars and years of racing success. Ferrari\u2019s strong brand and its long waiting list give it great pricing power and luxury-level profit margins. |\n| Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) | The pioneering maker of \u201cpremium electric vehicles\u201d has grown to be the world\u2019s most profitable EV automaker, and it dominates the U.S. EV market. Investors clearly expect great things from CEO Elon Musk and his team, and that includes ongoing EV sales, robotaxis, and full self-driving (FSD) technology. |\n| Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) | Formed in 2021 by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, this automaker's brands include Jeep, Ram, Dodge, Opel, Vauxhall, and Peugeot. It also owns the Fiat, Alfa Romeo, and Maserati brands, and it has strong operations in Europe and South America, as well as the U.S. |\n| Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY) | Volkswagen is one of the best-selling automakers outside the U.S. Its portfolio of brands includes VW, Skoda, and SEAT, plus the Audi, Lamborghini, Porsche, and Bentley luxury brands. |\n| Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) | Established in 1937, the Japanese automotive giant's portfolio of brands includes Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu, and Hino. The power of its brand and its global footprint make Toyota the largest car brand in the world in terms of sales. |\n| General Motors (NYSE:GM) | Owner of the GMC, Buick, Chevrolet, and Cadillac brands, GM is the largest car company in the U.S. in terms of sales. |\nThe auto industry\nThe auto industry\nYou\u2019ll find the following types of stocks within the automotive industry group:\n- Automakers, which manufacture cars, trucks, and sport utility vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs)\n- Suppliers of auto parts, from seats and spark plugs to complex electronic systems, tires, and batteries for electric cars\n- Auto dealer groups\n- Auto parts retailers\nEvaluating an automotive stock\nHow do you evaluate an automotive stock?\nAutomotive stocks are part of the consumer durables sector. This sector includes companies that make products intended to last for more than a few years, such as washing machines, dishwashers, furniture -- and cars and trucks.\nBefore investing in automotive stocks, it\u2019s important to understand how economic cycles affect automotive companies and how these companies work to maximize profits and stay competitive during good and bad economic times.\nThe auto sales cycle\nUnderstanding the auto sales cycle\nAutomakers and their suppliers are cyclical stocks, meaning their profits rise and fall with consumer confidence. It\u2019s easy to see why: When businesses and consumers are worried about the economy, they postpone buying new vehicles.\nAuto sales\u2019 cyclicality matters to investors because:\n- Automakers have high fixed costs that include factories, tooling, logistics networks, and labor contracts. These bills have to be paid no matter how many cars are sold.\n- Automakers and suppliers also need to invest in product development to make sure they have a steady stream of competitive new products.\n- High costs and steady spending mean profit margins in the automotive industry tend to be low, even during good economic times.\n- When sales slump, as in a recession, automotive companies\u2019 profits fall sharply -- putting future product spending and future competitiveness at risk.\nOne way to avoid the cyclicality of the sector is to buy stocks exposed to the replacement market, such as auto parts retailers or auto parts manufacturers that sell primarily to the secondary market.\nCash reserves\nCash reserves\nMost automotive companies sharply cut future product spending during the 2008-09 recession. The few that didn\u2019t, like Ford and Hyundai (OTC:HYMTF), had fresh products in their showrooms when the recovery began and were able to gain market share.\nThat was an important lesson for the industry. Now most global automakers tend to keep substantial cash reserves so they can keep investing to develop new products through recessions.\nOne interesting development during the COVID-19-induced recession was that many automakers decided to forgo investment in traditional internal-combustion engines in favor of EVs.\nMany automotive companies also pay dividends to their shareholders. Some automakers plan to use their cash reserves to continue to pay dividends during a recession.\nUnderstanding financial statements\nHow do you understand car companies\u2019 financial statements?\nFor the most part, automotive companies\u2019 financial statements aren\u2019t too hard to decipher. Here are three things to know:\n- Auto investors tend to look at operating income, or EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), as well as operating or EBIT margins (calculated by dividing profits by total revenue) and cash flow, to track an automotive company\u2019s financial performance. These include the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping vehicles, as well as research and development expenses (which can be very high in the automotive industry), while excluding interest costs and taxes less directly related to the company\u2019s ongoing performance.\n- Automakers will often provide adjusted figures that exclude the impact of one-time charges and gains such as write-offs and tax windfalls, which are useful for understanding the underlying performance of the business. (Note that one-time charges and gains can be important too.)\n- Many automakers have subsidiaries that are finance companies, providing loans and leases to customers and dealers. They can make automotive financial statements confusing for investors. To help, most automakers provide debt and cash flow figures specific to their core automaking businesses, often called \u201cautomotive\u201d or \u201cindustrial\u201d numbers. You can use those to understand a car company\u2019s debt and for comparisons between automakers.\nCompetition\nCompetition in the car industry\nGenerally speaking, the automaker with the newest products will get the highest prices and the biggest profits. Automakers must constantly invest to be sure they have a steady flow of new products in the pipeline.\nVirtually all automakers and many parts suppliers are also making big investments in future technologies such as EVs, extra safety features, and autonomous driving systems. Most experts believe those technologies will be necessary for automakers if they are to stay competitive in the not-too-distant future.\nElectric vehicles\nElectric vehicles\nSome exciting opportunities in the next few years will involve manufacturers of electric and hybrid electric vehicles. These are new and different, and most analysts expect them to largely displace internal-combustion vehicles over time.\nEV companies might see high growth, which is also exciting for investors. But it\u2019s important to remember that the processes involved in developing and manufacturing EVs aren\u2019t all that different from those used by makers of traditional internal-combustion vehicles. That means EV manufacturers face high costs, just like traditional automakers.\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that all the major traditional automakers are introducing electric vehicles of their own, and the competition in this segment of the market is fierce.\nThat competition has intensified as a combination of relatively high interest rates has slowed demand growth at a time when many carmakers have released new EV and hybrid models. As such, the main focus over the last year or so has been on cutting costs and reducing capacity where necessary.\nRelated investing topics\nAre automotive stocks for you?\nAre automotive stocks for you?\nAutomotive stocks can be important contributors to your investment portfolio. And because they rise and fall with consumer confidence, they can be useful indicators that economic trouble -- or a recovery -- may be on the way.\nIn addition, buying into an automotive maker means taking a positive view on the company's long-term hybrid and electric vehicle strategy. That's become harder to judge as relatively high interest rates slowed the rate of growth of EV unit sales and negatively impacted pricing as competition intensifies.\nFAQ\nAutomotive Stock FAQ\nWhat is the best automotive stock to buy?\nInvestors are willing to pay a premium for car companies with powerful electric vehicle brands, such as Tesla, and are discounting traditional internal combustion engine manufacturers. While the car industry is low-growth in terms of unit sales, the winning stocks will ultimately be those that are relevant to the transition to hybrid and electric vehicles.\nWhich is the fastest-growing auto stock in the world?\nWhat car companies are on the stock market?\nGiants like Toyota, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis own multiple brands. Other well-known brands with U.S. listings include Tesla, Honda (NYSE:HMC), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), VinFast (NASDAQ:VFS), Nio (NYSE:NIO), Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID), and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV). Lesser-known car companies such as NWTN (NASDAQ:NWTN) and Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNYW) are also listed on the U.S. market.\nWhat car companies are on the S&P 500?\nTesla, Ford, and General Motors are all members of the S&P 500 index."

      "text": "Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a measure of the profitability of a company's investments as a percentage of its capital from debt and equity. It's a useful metric to analyze a company and put its stock valuation in perspective.\nDigging through a company's financial statements and doing a little math can help you determine whether a company's stock deserves to be trading at a premium to its peers or if it's undervalued by the stock market.\nIn this article, we'll go over how to calculate ROIC, what investors can learn from the metric and where it falls short, and give a real-world example.\nUnderstanding ROIC\nUnderstanding ROIC\nReturn on invested capital can be very informative for investors. It takes into account the entire balance sheet and uses the income statement to evaluate it. It can be used with other profitability ratios such as return on equity to dig deeper into the business. ROIC accounts for the entire capital structure of a business -- both debt and equity -- as it's used to finance operations.\nROIC can be useful on its own. A high return on invested capital is a good sign that management is investing in profitable projects. However, it's best used when compared to the cost of capital for a business.\nA weighted average cost of capital (WACC) tells investors how much it costs a business to finance its activities across both debt and equity. If the company produces a ROIC greater than its WACC, it's creating value for shareholders. However, if ROIC is less than WACC, the company is paying more to finance operations than it's generating in profits.\nROIC is much more important in some industries than others. It provides a lot more value for investors in capital-intensive businesses such as brick-and-mortar retailers, telecommunications, and energy companies. Businesses with low capital intensity like software companies won't put too much focus on ROIC. It becomes confusing to use ROIC to evaluate financial companies, where capital is a part of the business itself. That makes it practically inapplicable to the industry.\nHow to calculate ROIC\nHow to calculate ROIC\nCalculating return on invested capital requires you to dig into a company's financial statements.\nROIC is calculated with a simple formula:\nNet Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT) divided by Invested Capital. (It's expressed as a percentage.)\nCalculating NOPAT\nTo calculate NOPAT, you'll need two numbers that can be found on a company's income statement: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) and the company's marginal tax rate.\nYou may have to do a little digging to find EBIT. You can take operating income and add in any other income the company generated. Or you may find EBITDA and subtract depreciation and amortization expenses from that.\nFor most companies based in the U.S., the federal marginal tax rate is currently 21%. The state tax rate will vary depending on where a company is based and where they pay taxes. You can also use the company's effective tax rate for the period, but be sure to adjust for any one-time tax events.\nOnce you have those numbers, the formula is NOPAT = EBIT * (1-tax rate).\nFor example, if a company generated $1 billion in EBIT with a marginal tax rate of 25%, its NOPAT is $1 billion * (1-25%) = $750 million.\nCalculating invested capital\nThere are two ways to calculate invested capital: One looks at the company's assets, and another looks at its financing from debt and equity. Given the choice, it's better to calculate invested capital using the company's assets since it will give you a better view of how the company is using its capital.\nUsing the assets on the balance sheet, start calculating invested capital by determining working capital. Working capital is equal to current assets minus non-interest-bearing current liabilities such as accounts payable or accrued expenses.\nTo net working capital, you then add property, plants, and equipment, goodwill, and other operating assets to get invested capital.\nFor example, if a company had $2 billion in current assets; $1 billion in non-interest-bearing current liabilities; $2.5 billion in property, plants, and equipment; $500 million in goodwill; and $1 billion in other operating assets, it would have invested capital of $5 billion.\nYou may reduce invested capital by excess cash, which is any cash not needed for day-to-day operations. There are no hard and fast rules, however, for determining how much cash is necessary and how much is excess.\nPutting it all together\nOnce you have NOPAT and invested capital figured out, it's a simple division problem.\nFrom the example given above, ROIC = $750 million / $5 billion = 15%.\nDrawbacks of ROIC\nDrawbacks of ROIC\nThere are a few drawbacks of using ROIC.\nMany companies operate multiple segments. Some may be extremely capital-intensive; others may not. They may operate in entirely different industries from one another. Since ROIC takes into account the entire company's operations, it can be difficult to know whether the bulk of value is generated by a single segment or if the entire company is producing strong investment returns.\nThe metric also is less applicable to some industries than others. Trying to use ROIC to evaluate financial companies is going to create a mess because banks and insurance companies use capital in their products.\nSome factors might generate misleading ROIC numbers. For example, a company with a lot of goodwill on its balance sheet will generate a lower ROIC as a result of the bigger denominator. If a company writes down goodwill, you'll need to make adjustments to perform a useful historical analysis of its ROIC.\nLots of capital leases compared to competitors also may skew the results of ROIC analysis unless you make adjustments to account for leases. Excess cash on hand will deflate ROIC unless adjusted. Since cash isn't really invested capital, any excess cash on hand should be removed from net working capital.\nAdditionally, a non-recurring event generating a big gain or loss could affect profits and shouldn't be used for evaluating normal operations of the business. Be sure to account for differences in balance sheets and anomalies in the income statements when comparing ROIC across companies.\nReal-world example of ROIC\nReal-world example of ROIC\nLet's take a look at Walmart's (WMT -1.18%) return on invested capital from fiscal 2022.\nFirst, we need to calculate Walmart's NOPAT. To do that, we can take its operating income of $25.942 billion and multiply by its effective tax rate of 25.44%. While the effective tax rate isn't necessarily the same as its marginal tax rate, it presents the best approximation of the figure available. As such, we get a NOPAT of $19.342 billion.\nNext, determine Walmart's invested capital. Walmart had $244.86 billion in total assets on its balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2022. That includes capital and finance lease rights-of-use, but those are arguably necessary for its operations. It had $82.172 billion in accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and accrued taxes, leaving it with $162.688 billion in invested capital. Its cash holdings of $14.76 billion seem reasonable enough, so no adjustments are needed.\nDoing the same calculation for invested capital at the beginning of the year results in a total of $165.147 billion. So, the average invested capital over the year was about $163.918 billion.\nTherefore, Walmart's ROIC in 2022 = $19.432 / $163.918 = 11.8%.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line\nUsing return on invested capital can give you a better understanding of a business and how it uses its balance sheet to generate profits for investors. You can also analyze its financing and future investments based on ROIC and analyze its historical trends.\nROIC can be very valuable in comparing one company against its competitors. If one company has a notably higher ROIC -- after adjusting for differences in balance sheets -- it indicates that it has a competitive advantage. As such, its stock ought to trade at a premium valuation relative to its peers. If it doesn't, it may present a buying opportunity for a savvy investor.\nAt the very least, performing an ROIC analysis will require you to dig into a company's financial statements and learn more about the companies you're analyzing. The practice will make you a better investor."

      "text": "Many investors focus their attention on how a stock's price changes over time. However, when talking about dividend-paying stocks, that doesn't even begin to tell the entire story.\nFor example, let's say JPMorgan Chase (JPM 1.55%) was trading for roughly $150 per share three years ago and is currently trading at around $240 per share. It may sound like investors who bought the stock made $90 per share over the three-year period.\nHowever, if I tell you Verizon (VZ -1.44%) also paid its shareholders about $14 per share in dividends over the past three years, that changes the story a little. Instead of the $90 capital gain per share, which translates to 60%, investors actually made significantly more when accounting for dividends paid.\nTotal return considers both capital gains and dividends for a complete picture of a stock's performance over a specified time. This can be extremely useful for evaluating investment returns among dividend stocks, comparing the performance of dividend stocks to those without dividends or other distributions, and comparing investment results when stocks are held for different lengths of time.\nWhat they are\nWhat are total returns?\nSimply put, an investment's total return is its overall return from all sources, such as capital gains, dividends, and other distributions to shareholders. As a basic example, a stock that paid a 5% dividend yield relative to its purchase price and increased in value by 5% over the first year you owned it would have produced a total return of 10% over the one-year period.\nTotal returns can be calculated as a dollar amount or as a percentage. In other words, you can say a stock's total return is $8 per share over a certain one-year period or that its total return was 11%. The best way to express total return depends on the context you're using it for, as we'll see throughout the rest of this discussion.\nTotal return can also be expressed on an overall basis or over specified time intervals. If you held a stock for several years, it might be useful to know its overall total return during your holding period.\nAlternatively, knowing your total return on an annualized basis could help you compare the results of that investment with those of others you own or with the stock market as a whole. In later sections, we'll discuss the actual calculation methods and provide some examples.\nWhy they matter\nWhy are total returns important?\nTotal return allows you to see the big picture when it comes to how well (or poorly) an investment is actually doing, not just how its share price is performing. Many stock investments, in particular, are designed to produce a combination of income and capital gains. Total return combines these two types of investment returns into a single metric.\nMany investors make the mistake of focusing only on how much their stocks move up and down, often ignoring other ways their investments have generated returns in their portfolio, particularly dividends. Similarly, many income-focused investors often judge their investments primarily on the dividends paid and don't pay enough attention to share-price movements.\nTotal return can be highly useful when you're assessing the performance of your investments and comparing their performance to each other or to the overall stock market.\nImportant terms\nImportant terms investors should know\nTo truly understand total returns and how to use them effectively, there are a few other investment terms and concepts you should know. Knowing these will also help you become a more well-rounded investor. Here are just a few.\nAnnualized return\nYour annualized return is an investment return expressed on a yearly basis. For instance, if you have one investment that produced a 20% total return in three years and another that produced a 35% total return in five years, it can be difficult at first glance to determine which was the better investment.\nWe'll get into the calculation of annualized total returns later. The point is that it can be a more apples-to-apples comparison to see investment returns expressed on an annualized (i.e., yearly) basis, especially if they were held for different periods.\nSimple returns\nThere are two ways to express investment returns over time: simple and compound. A simple return (or simple interest) is a rate of return based on the principal (i.e., the original investment amount) year after year.\nThis is often used in the context of fixed-income (bond) investments. For example, if a bond costs $1,000 and yields 5%, that is a form of simple return -- in other words, 5% of the original cost, or $50, will be paid to the bondholder every year until maturity.\nCompound returns\nA compound return (or compound interest) is a return that is paid on the principal and any accumulated returns that have already been paid. Annualized total return is a form of compound return.\nAs a simplified example to illustrate compound returns, consider an investment that generates a 10% annualized total return. If you invest $1,000, you can expect to have $1,100 by the end of the first year. For the second year, however, the 10% would be added to the $1,100, not the original $1,000. So, you'd end up with $1,210 at the end of the second year.\nCompounding frequency\nThe method most often used to calculate total returns is annual compounding. That's what the formula I will discuss in the next section will do.\nHowever, other compounding intervals are possible when computing returns and interest charges in finance. For example, your bank probably compounds your interest daily or monthly on your savings account. Other intervals, like quarterly, weekly, or semiannual compounding, are also possible.\nTo give you just an idea of how this works, a $1,000 investment that generates 10% total returns compounded semiannually would be worth $1,050 after six months. After another six months, a 5% (half of the annual return) gain would be added, which would make it $1,102.50.\nDividend reinvestment/DRIP\nTo maximize the total returns of a long-term investment, dividend reinvestment is an essential step. This means that when your stocks pay you dividends, you use those dividend payments to buy additional shares of the same stock.\nWith most brokers, you can enroll your stocks in a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) that will do this automatically and without any additional trading commissions. If you're a long-term investor, enrolling in a DRIP can help you maximize your total returns, and it can make more of a difference than you might think over long periods.\nInternal rate of return (IRR)\nInternal rate of return (IRR) is similar in concept to total return. However, it involves a more complicated calculation.\nAside from its complexity, the biggest difference between IRR and total return is that IRR is a forward-looking metric that incorporates things like projected dividends or distributions, future profitability, and more. This is more commonly used when talking about real estate investments, but it can also be applied to stocks when trying to project long-term returns from different prospective investments.\nExpected total return\nExpected total return is the same calculation as total return but using future assumptions instead of actual investment results. For example, if you predict that a stock trading for $30 will rise to $33 over the next year while paying $2 in dividends, your expected total return is $5 per share or 16.7%.\nObviously, nobody has a crystal ball that can predict stock performance, and an investment's past performance doesn't guarantee its future results. That said, projections can still be a valuable tool when analyzing opportunities, so using the information you have to calculate the expected total return can help you get an idea of the future potential of certain investment opportunities.\nRisk-adjusted return\nThis uses the risk-free rate of return and investment volatility to account for an investment's risk level when calculating returns. A basic investment goal is to maximize the amount of return produced by investments relative to the total risk. In other words, a lower return from a low-risk investment can be a better risk-adjusted return than a superior return produced by a higher-risk investment.\nOne popular way to assess risk-adjusted returns is with a metric called the Sharpe ratio. This not-too-complicated metric subtracts the risk-free rate of return from an investment's actual return and then divides it by the standard deviation (volatility) of that return.\nUnrealized versus realized capital gains\nAn unrealized capital gain refers to a stock or other investment that has increased in value since you bought it but that you still own. In other words, if you paid $5,000 for a stock investment that is now worth $6,000, you can't spend that $1,000 of profit until you sell. Once you sell an appreciated investment, it is then referred to as a realized capital gain. This is an important concept in the context of total returns.\nCalculation\nHow to calculate total return for a stock investment\nNow, we'll go through the process of calculating total returns. There are a few ways to calculate total return depending on the exact form of the metric you're looking for, but the good news is that none of them are particularly complex.\nTo determine an investment's overall total return, follow these steps:\n- First, determine how much capital gains it has produced since you bought it. For instance, if you paid $50 for a stock that's now trading for $60, your capital gain is $10 per share.\n- Second, you need to add up the dividends and other distributions the investment has paid over your entire holding period. Adding this figure to your capital gains will give you the investment's total return in dollars.\n- Third, to express total return as a percentage, which is generally more useful, simply take the dollar amount of total return you calculated, divide it by the price you paid for the investment, and multiply the result by 100.\n- Finally, to annualize the total return, you'll need a bit more complicated math. Take the percentage total return you found in the previous step (written as a decimal) and add 1. Then, raise this to the power of 1 divided by the number of years you held the investment. Finally, subtract 1. In mathematical form, this looks like:\nThis formula assumes annual compounding, which keeps the calculation as uncomplicated as possible. Other methods, such as continuous or monthly compounding, are also available, but this method is generally sufficient for calculating and comparing investment returns.\nExample\nA real-world example\nThat last part may sound a bit confusing, especially when calculating annualized total returns, so let's look at a step-by-step real-world example. Let's say you bought shares of Bank of America (BAC 2.55%) stock on Jan. 2, 2020, and sold them on Jan. 2, 2025. Now, you want to determine your total return on your investment. Before we start, here's the information you need to know:\n- You bought shares for $35.50.\n- Two years later, you sold those shares for $44.50.\n- Over the five-year holding period, Bank of America paid 20 quarterly dividends, which added up to $4.04.\nLet's review the three total return calculations I discussed in the last section. First, your overall total return. Your capital gain on each share was $44.50 minus $35.50, or $9.00 per share. Adding the $4.04 in dividends you received shows a total return of $13.04 per share on your investment.\nSecond, to convert this total return to a percentage, you need to divide the $13.04 total return by the purchase price for each share, or $35.50, and then multiply by 100. This gives you a total return of 36.7% over five years.\nFinally, to calculate your annualized total return, you need to use the formula from the last section. When you do, you'll get an annualized total return of about 6.5%.\nReinvested dividends\nTotal return with reinvested dividends\nNow, it's worth mentioning that if you're reinvesting your dividends as you go -- which I absolutely recommend long-term investors do -- the calculation gets a bit more complicated. Essentially, each reinvestment becomes its own return calculation, including the capital gains generated from the newly purchased shares.\nCalculating total returns with reinvested dividends is difficult using the previously discussed method. After all, you'll buy new shares at whatever price they're trading for as of the dividend payment date, and you'll end up with more shares than you started with, and then those shares will begin to pay you dividends as well. So, what's the solution?\nThe total return calculation with reinvested dividends can be simplified by looking at the investment on an overall value (as opposed to a per-share) basis. Consider our Bank of America example from the previous section. Let's say that you invested $10,000 in the stock and that after five years of reinvesting your dividends, your investment is now worth $14,160 -- a 41.6% total return (or 0.416 in decimal form).\nUsing our formula for annualized total return, we see that your total return with reinvested dividends is about 7.2% per year, which is significantly higher. So, by reinvesting your dividends, you achieved a slightly better total return than you would have by simply collecting the dividends paid by the stock.\nHow to use\nHow to use total return calculations in your investment strategy\nThere are a few practical uses for the concept of total return. As I've mentioned, total return is a good way to compare the performance of various investments over time. For example, let's say you own five stocks in your portfolio and have invested $1,000 in each one. Some don't pay dividends at all, and those that do pay varying amounts.\nAt first glance, it can be difficult to determine which of these stocks was the best performer over any multiyear period, especially if you don't automatically reinvest your dividends and just receive the payments in cash in your brokerage account. This is where total return comes in -- it can give you a single number that sums up the performance of each investment.\nFrom a strategy perspective, evaluating expected total returns from your investments can be useful when making decisions. As a personal example, I'm a big fan of real estate investment trusts (REITs), which are specifically designed to be total-return investments with a nice combination of income and capital gain.\nBy assessing one of these stocks' track records of total returns and determining whether the company's business composition has changed, I can compare total return potential when screening prospective investments.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line on total return\nTotal return is a great metric to add to your investment knowledge. Some investments are designed to produce a great deal of capital appreciation, while others are intended to produce income. Total return combines these two types of investment performance into a single metric.\nKnowing how to calculate and apply total return can help you evaluate the overall performance of different stocks, compare different potential investments, and understand the value of dividend reinvestment, to name just a few things."

      "text": "Companies need to grow, or they risk becoming inconsequential and dying. They do this through different methods, including organic growth. Using an organic growth strategy is often an inexpensive way to continue a company's trajectory without having to be acquired or merge with the competition.\nWhat is organic growth?\nWhat is organic growth?\nOrganic growth is a process through which companies expand using their own resources rather than utilizing external resources. This type of growth can be slow, but it's also less expensive, since the company doesn't require a loan to grow and can instead work on things like optimizing internal processes and shuffling employees into more efficient roles.\nFor many small companies, organic growth is their best strategy since it doesn't rely on leveraging too many resources. It also avoids joining with other companies that might not have similar goals or visions for the industry in which they operate.\nOrganic vs. inorganic\nOrganic growth vs. inorganic growth\nOrganic growth is a type of growth that just happens as businesses mature and expand. This type of growth results from products growing in popularity and management working out more efficient ways to produce goods or provide services. Organic growth happens within the existing framework of a company, without any outside funding. It's accomplished simply through improving business processes and due to the effect of time.\nInorganic growth for businesses, on the other hand, happens due to mergers and acquisitions or by borrowing money for activities like opening new locations or new subsidiaries to expand the business. You can tell the difference because inorganic growth involves an increase in assets, operations, liabilities, and liquidity, all of which will appear on the balance sheets.\nOver time, if the expansion or merger is successful, that growth becomes organic growth since it's resulting from a fully integrated part of the business.\nStrategies\nOrganic growth strategies\nSpecific organic growth strategies depend heavily on what the business is doing and offering to the public. In general, however, you can expect organic growth to occur from changes in operations, like:\n- Changing marketing or branding strategies.\n- Reallocating company efforts and funds into higher-profit areas.\n- Developing new products or services that meet untapped customer needs.\n- Reaching customers in new places, such as online or at trade shows.\nOf course, none of this is possible without tracking key metrics that can act as performance indicators and using those metrics to develop actionable steps that grow the company's business activities. The key to organic growth is generally delivering more products or services to more customers, who are so delighted that they become brand ambassadors, helping the company to grow even more.\nRelated investing topics\nWhy it matters\nWhy organic growth matters to investors\nAlthough inorganic growth is fast and can increase a company's profitability almost instantly, it also can crash and burn spectacularly. Investing a lot of money into new branches that don't become profitable is a dangerous move for businesses and the people who invest in them.\nOn the other hand, organic growth within a business, large or small, shows that the company is still capable of growth, change, and keeping up with the demands of its customers. Organic growth is slow and takes a lot of effort, but for long-term investors, it fits perfectly with their own investment mindset.\nKnowing what your company is doing and why is vital to both understanding where their money comes from and how they'll continue to expand over time."

And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "For well over a century, Wall Street has served as a surefire moneymaker for optimists and those with a long-term mindset. But the stock market's list of winners includes more than just institutional investors and billionaire money managers.\nSince the advent and proliferation of the internet in the mid-1990s, retail investors have been playing an increasingly larger role on Wall Street. According to \"The Retail Investor Report,\" which was published in 2023 by the University of Missouri-Kansas City's School of Law, everyday investors accounted for 25% of equities trading volume in 2021, which was almost double the percentage they accounted for a decade prior.\nAs retail investors have become a foundational aspect of the stock market, online brokerages have angled their platforms to cater to these investors. This includes Robinhood Markets, whose online platform (Robinhood) has resonated with everyday investors. Offering commission-free trades on major U.S. exchanges and the ability to buy fractional shares has made Robinhood especially popular.\nBut perhaps the greatest aspect of Robinhood's investment platform is the data it's willing to share. Robinhood's \"100 Most Popular\" leaderboard lists the 100 most-held securities (stocks and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs) on the platform. Recently, electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla topped Nvidia to become the most-held stock on Robinhood.\nWhile growth stocks and diversified ETFs tend to dominate the top holdings on the 100 Most Popular leaderboard, one stock stands out as an anomaly. It's the only ultra-high-yield dividend stock -- \"ultra-high-yield\" in the sense that it's yield is four or more times greater than the average yield of the S&P 500 -- in the top 25 holdings. Say hello to retail investors' favorite supercharged income stock on Robinhood... Ford Motor Company (F 3.44%).\nRetail investors are stomping the accelerator on Ford for a variety of reasons\nAs of the closing bell on July 8, Ford was the seventh most-held security on Robinhood, trailing only aforementioned rival Tesla, along with Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, and the most-held ETF, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. The next-closest ultra-high-yield stock on the leaderboard is Pfizer, which is the 27th most-held security by retail investors.\nOne reason everyday investors can be excited about Ford is its historical consistency. Despite automakers ebbing-and-flowing with the health of the U.S. and global economy, few things have stood the test of time quite like Ford's F-Series trucks. The F-Series has been the best-selling truck in the U.S. for 48 consecutive years (through 2024), and the top-selling vehicle of any kind in the U.S. for 43 straight years.\nIn the business world, bigger isn't always better. But when it comes to selling vehicles, bigger often leads to higher vehicle margins. Ford's ability to consistently sell more trucks than its competition is fantastic news for its vehicle margin and bottom line.\nRetail investors also appreciate Ford's nimbleness with its capital expenditures. While EVs have been largely viewed as a no-brainer long-term growth opportunity, EV demand has tapered in recent years, with the infrastructure not yet in place to support a ramp up in all-electric transportation.\nDespite committing up to $50 billion in EV investments through 2026, Ford announced in October 2023 that it would delay up to $12 billion in EV spending until capacity necessitates additional investment. Even though Ford's EV segment is currently a drag on its bottom line, having the ability to pull this proverbial handbrake should buoy its cash flow and ensure EV losses don't worsen.\nAnother factor potentially responsible for making Ford a top-seven holding on Robinhood is CEO Jim Farley's efforts to improve his company's production quality. Ford has struggled with higher warranty-related costs since Farley took the reins from former CEO Jim Hackett on Oct. 1, 2020. Thankfully, J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Initial Quality Study rankings show Ford has been inching its way up the list among other brands -- it ranked 14th out of the 33 brands in the latest study. While there's still work to be done, Ford's higher warranty expenses should taper in the coming years.\nLastly, everyday investors are probably intrigued by Ford's inexpensive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio amid a historically expensive stock market. Shares of Ford can be scooped up right now for about 8 times forecast earnings in 2026. In comparison, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E Ratio is effectively at its third-highest multiple during a continuous bull market when back-tested 154 years.\nWhen a forward P/E of around 8 is coupled with a 5.14% dividend yield, you get retail investors' favorite ultra-high-yield dividend stock on Robinhood.\nFord stock is (temporarily) in the slow lane for a reason\nHowever, Ford stock is down 21% over the trailing decade, not including dividends, which represents a 220-percentage-point underperformance of the broad-based S&P 500. There are well-defined reasons for Ford to the be in the proverbial slow lane, and it may not buck these headwinds anytime soon.\nThe most obvious of these headwinds is President Donald Trump's tariff and trade policy. In late April, the president implemented tariffs on most imported automobiles, which he proclaimed won't be going away. These tariffs run the risk of reigniting inflation domestically and worsening sales of American vehicles in foreign markets. It's also worth pointing out that the Trump administration's messaging on tariffs has been consistently inconsistent... and Wall Street values predictability above all else.\nAnother concern for Ford investors is the potential for the U.S. economy to dip into a recession. Despite the probability of a U.S. recession declining in recent months, economic downturns, while short-lived, are normal, healthy, and inevitable. Auto stocks are highly cyclical and effectively tied at the hip to the U.S. economy. If consumers begin to worry about their jobs and/or near-term economic growth, it may lead to new vehicle purchases being pushed further down the road.\nIt's also not clear when the EV revolution is going to work in Ford's favor. Though it seems inevitable that Ford's Model e division (this is its all-EV operating segment) will be a long-term growth driver, there's uncertainty as to when EV infrastructure will be sufficient to drive mainstream EV adoption across the country.\nAn argument can also be made that Ford isn't as historically cheap as it's been in the past. While its forward P/E of a little over 8 is considerably lower than the average forward P/E of S&P 500 companies, it represents a 13% premium to its average forward P/E multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\nThough Ford stock makes for an intriguing investment when looking three, five, or 10 years out, it could struggle to gain traction at its current valuation in the coming quarters given these aforementioned headwinds."

  "argos_summary": "Ford Motor Company is a long\u2011standing automaker with a strong brand and a history of best\u2011selling F\u2011Series trucks, but its revenue growth has been modest and its profitability remains low, especially as the company incurs losses in its electric\u2011vehicle segment. The stock offers a high dividend yield and a relatively cheap forward P/E, attracting income\u2011focused retail investors, yet it has underperformed the S&P\u202f500 over the past decade and is unlikely to generate significant capital appreciation. Overall, Ford is best viewed as an income play rather than a growth engine, with cyclical demand and EV uncertainty limiting its long\u2011term upside.",
