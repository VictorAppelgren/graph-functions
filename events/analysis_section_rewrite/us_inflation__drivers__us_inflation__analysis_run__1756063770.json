      "feedback": "The draft has a solid tri‑regime framing and a coherent link to macro/policy/flows, but it needs a sharper, first‑principles causal chain, tighter quantification, and explicit alignment to SECTION FOCUS; to reach world‑class, restructure into a regime map with explicit cause–effect steps (Inflation/real rate impulse → policy response → capex/valuation dynamics → sectoral/stock impacts), and tether every assertion to the cited numbers (probabilities 50/30/20; tariffs at baseline 10% with escalations; oil supply/demand paths; Ford’s EV economics; ACMR base case), citing IDs after each factual claim (NL5YYTLF2, T1QE6JPIX, SGB2PAZGK, 37UZC9X8I, 22PL3Q360, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX); replace generic language with explicit mechanisms (e.g., how a 10% tariff raises input costs, compresses multiples, and redirects capex toward U.S. fabs/AI/data centers). Build a four‑part scenario structure (Base Regime A, Alternate Regime B, downside Regime C) with clearly stated catalysts and invalidation points: tariff cadence (renewal/extension timing), Fed rhetoric on the neutral rate path, oil‑market surprises ( Brent/WTI bands ), and energy demand shifts (quantified ranges for 2025–26 supply/demand and refinery runs, e.g., 85.6 mbpd gas), plus explicit triggers/thresholds for regime shifts. Quantify valuations and earnings implications under each regime (e.g., S&P 500 multiples compression/expansion ranges, Ford’s EV losses ~$1.3B and adj. EBIT ~4.3%, ROIC ~10.1% with ~2.5% revenue CAGR 2014–2024, ACMR 2025 revenue ~$900m and gross margin ~4%), then reconcile any conflicts between sources by stating assumptions and presenting sensitivity bands. Structure the write‑up to satisfy SECTION FOCUS by (1) summarizing macro/policy/flows/positioning in a single cross‑topic synthesis, (2) clarifying direction and mechanism, (3) flagging 4–6 decisive signals with time windows, and (4) presenting a concise watch‑list of signals (tariff renewal cadence, Fed communications, oil‑supply surprises, EV/capex cycle) with explicit thresholds and dates. Finally, tighten the prose to remove redundancies, ensure every claim maps to a source ID, and explicitly call out where sources diverge and how you reconcile them (cite all critical sources).",
