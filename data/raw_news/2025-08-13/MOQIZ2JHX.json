  "description": "Spending two weeks with Apple's public beta of watchOS 26 gave me a good feel for the new features like the wrist flick gestures and the Workout Buddy.",
  "content": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nAt WWDC 2025, Apple announced it was replacing the sequential numbering for OS versions and with year numbers. So instead of watchOS 12, I\u2019ve spent the past two weeks with the public beta of watchOS 26. The naming scheme shift is subtle, but helpful \u2014 which is how I\u2019d describe the upgrades the new software brings to the Apple Watch. The AI-powered Workout Buddy better contextualizes your Fitness data and an added gesture gives the watch a fun trick that\u2019s actually helpful. Other upgrades \u2014 including better smart replies and the Liquid Glass treatment \u2014 all combine to make the watch work and look a bit better than it did before. It\u2019s not a game-changing shift, like other OS 26 releases, but it manages to make a great watch a touch better.\n\nEvery Apple operating system got the Liquid Glass treatment this year, including watchOS 26. The change is less noticeable on the Apple Watch than on the iPhone or iPad, though. You\u2019ll notice the semi-transparent buttons and flowy movement when entering your password and opening the control center \u2014 the icons look like they\u2019re surrounded in little drops of water, which is quite pretty. You\u2019ll see it on the Photos watch face, too, especially if you select the \u201cglass\u201d color for the time readout.\n\nThe Smart Stack now has a liminal glow and the app icons are likewise a touch more luminous than before. The effect is subtle and nicely unifies the look of the watch and its companion iPhone. Like all design upgrades, Liquid Glass made me feel like I was using a new watch \u2014 though, like everything, the novelty wore off after a week or two.\n\nIn addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it\u2019s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select \u201cPicked for you\u201d or \u201cChoose media.\u201d The former will select music that matches the type of workout you\u2019re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it.\n\nI was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t always work correctly. Sometimes I\u2019d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I\u2019m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I\u2019m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.\n\nThe new Workout Buddy is probably the biggest AI play in watchOS 26. It uses historical and real-time data collected by your watch to give you a window into how you\u2019re performing at the beginning, end and throughout a workout. It works for walking, running, cycling and other workouts but requires headphones and a nearby Apple Intelligence-compatible iPhone. That gave me pause. I hate carrying stuff and/or sticking things in my ears when I run. But after acquiring some open earbuds and digging out my old Spibelt, I made it work.\n\nThere are three voices to choose from as of this writing, a bright feminine option, a British male-sounding one and another female-presenting version with a lower register. These were built on vocal data from Fitness+ trainers and have an authentic sound to them. At the start of a workout, you\u2019ll get a brief pep talk along with some recent milestones. My pre-game walking and running talks included references to the day of the week, my location and accumulated fitness data. For example, \u201cWay to get out there on a Wednesday morning walk in Albuquerque. So far this week, you\u2019ve done three walking workouts. Let\u2019s get in some steps!\u201d\n\nDepending on the type of exercise, you can set target ranges for cadence, heart rate, speed, distance, power (cycling), time and others. During a workout, the AI will let you know if you\u2019re at, below or above those levels. The first time I tried Workout Buddy, my run was quite lonely. I didn\u2019t realize I had to turn on the Buddy, as well as the various goal metrics within the Workout app. I did that and, on my next run, the AI delivered cadence and heart rate updates, and let me know when I hit milestones like distance and duration.\n\nAt the end of a workout, you\u2019ll see a thinking animation as the AI assembles a summary. It\u2019ll recap data like your pace, distance, average and peak heart rate, as well as progress on your Activity rings. It\u2019ll also point out comparisons or cumulative milestones you may have hit. For example, after a longer walk, it told me that I\u2019d just burned the most calories on a walk so far. Another day, it told me I\u2019d walked ten miles so far this week. It closes the update by encouraging you to take the energy into the rest of your day or something similarly positive but measured.\n\nThat\u2019s a big improvement over the first few times I used the feature. My first few pep talks were cloying, telling me something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get out there early in the morning!\u201d and \u201cYour effort is inspiring!\" After I stopped a run early to fuss with settings, it told me I did a \u201cGreat job!\u201d on a three-minute run. Thankfully, Apple appears to be tweaking the Buddy behind the scenes, calibrating the AI\u2019s \u201cpersonality.\u201d Recent pep talks have become noticeably less sycophantic and therefore more enjoyable. I imagine the Buddy will only continue to evolve even more from here.\n\nThe Workout Buddy is not a coach\n\nThe Workout Buddy is a motivational experience that provides personalized insights you can use to gauge your performance. But I just finished trying out Samsung\u2019s AI running coach on the Galaxy Watch and couldn\u2019t help comparing the two. That coach pushed me to run five kilometers for the first time in my life. The Buddy made me feel like I\u2019d accomplished something special just by taking my dog on a stroll. Both have their place, but I\u2019d say Apple\u2019s version is probably best for those who already know what their goals are and what they need to do to hit them. Samsung\u2019s version may be better for beginners who want some help shaping their fitness journey.\n\nIn addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it\u2019s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select \u201cPicked for you\u201d or \u201cChoose media.\u201d The former will select music that matches the type of workout you\u2019re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it.\n\nI was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t always work correctly. Sometimes I\u2019d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I\u2019m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I\u2019m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.\n\nI love the double tap gesture Apple introduced with the Apple Watch Series 9 \u2014 it\u2019s a pleasure to stop timers, start auto-detected workouts and answer calls without getting my other hand involved. But it took some practice before I could reliably get the watch to recognize the gesture. (The trick is raising your wrist in an exaggerated checking-the-time motion then quickly, but not too quickly, tapping your thumb and finger together twice.)\n\nLuckily, the new Wrist Flick motion introduced in watchOS 26 takes practically no effort to get right. It involves quickly turning the back of your wrist away from you and back up again. Doing that can silence a call, stop a ringing timer, dismiss notifications and return you to the watch face from any app you open. It also makes those helpful \u201cTime to stand!\u201d reminders go away. The wrist flick doesn\u2019t clear alerts, just dismisses them \u2014 so the red indicator dot disappears, but the notification remains and you can see it if you swipe down. Just note that it\u2019s only available to Apple Watch Series 9, 10 and the Ultra 2.\n\nWrist flick is a great feature \u2014 though it's important to note that Android wearables since WearOS 2 had a similar feature for a while now. And I\u2019d like to see Apple adopt more hands-free interactions like this. Apple already has many gesture-based controls as part of its existing AssistiveTouch feature. Actions like fist clenches, wrist tilts and single or double taps can control most of the navigation on the watch. Unfortunately, turning on AssistiveTouch turns off the universal double tap feature. I\u2019d be interested in seeing something that splits the difference. Perhaps four or five gestures for basic functions that can be used in conjunction with screen input.\n\nThe Apple Watch is great for reading texts, but replying is awkward. That tiny keyboard is an interface for ants \u2014 even talk-to-text input is inefficient as it\u2019s tough to correct mistakes. Smart Replies are little canned responses that appear as suggestions below the reply field. Those aren\u2019t new, but now Series 9 watches and later will use an improved on-device language model to come up with relevant bits of text you can send with a tap.\n\nIn addition to the choices that are always offered \u2014 Okay, Yes, No, Thank you and Can I call you later? \u2014 I saw things like \u201cOk, let me know\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s so sweet!\u201d both of which applied to their respective conversations. I wasn\u2019t always given Smart Reply suggestions, and some of them weren\u2019t very relevant, but again, it\u2019s a great feature that will save time when it works.\n\nAnother Messages update is a carryover from iOS 26 (and borrowed from countless other messaging apps). You can now set custom backgrounds for each of your (Apple-only) contacts. Just note that whatever you set will be seen by all participants in the conversation, once they update to iOS 26. On your watch, the photo, gradient or pattern you pick carries over to your conversations. Not only does it look nice, I find backgrounds help me to not accidentally text my mom something I meant to send to my sister.\n\nThe Notes app is now on Apple Watch. I honestly hadn\u2019t noticed the lack before this \u2014 I know there are plenty of Notes enthusiasts out there, but in my world, Alexa handles all reminder and shopping list duties. Still, I can see how the new integration could come in handy. After creating a simple shopping checklist in the iOS Notes app, I opened the list on my watch while I was shopping and found it far easier to check things off on my wrist than dragging out my phone every time I stuck something in my cart.\n\nI\u2019m curious to see whether Apple\u2019s improved prediction algorithms for the new OS will eventually add Notes to my Smart Stack suggestions after I open the Notes app a few times at the grocery store. As it stands now, the Notes widget will pop up first in the Smart Stack if that\u2019s the last app you used.\n\nThe rest of the new stuff\n\nThe iPhone Watch app has a new look and now organizes watch faces by category instead of by name. Groupings include New, Clean, Data-rich, Photos and Health and Fitness, among others. It\u2019s certainly an improvement, but one that makes you wonder why it wasn\u2019t always like this.\n\nAnother nice-but-obvious update adjusts the volume of pings and beeps to fit the environment \u2014 quieter in a noiseless office and louder at a raucous BBQ. I set a timer to go off when I was quietly working at my desk and then again with loud music playing and I couldn\u2019t really tell the difference. But that\u2019s a hard metric for the humble human ear to judge. Again, this is a feature reserved for Series 9 models and later.\n\nThe Smart Stack will now add a small prompt to your watch face when it detects certain situations. For example, if you open the camera app on your phone, a small camera icon appears at the bottom of your watch screen, as a suggestion to open the remote shutter. Apple gives other examples, such as showing the workout icon when you arrive at your usual pilates studio or the Backtrack navigation feature when you journey away from cellular connectivity.\n\nI didn\u2019t see the prompt very often, but I did notice that the Smart Stack rearranged itself according to my habits \u2014 such as putting the medication widget at the top of the stack right around the time it was time to take my prescription, or shuffling Shazam to the top when it hears music playing.\n\nComing fresh off of reviewing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, I can\u2019t help but notice a stark difference between that wearable\u2019s fully integrated, AI-powered Gemini and Apple\u2019s same-old Siri. Gemini on the Samsung watch helped me find new stuff in my city, performed convoluted tasks and answered some pretty esoteric questions. I use Siri on my watch to reliably set timers, text people and add events to my calendar. But it\u2019s not quite on the level of Gemini\u2019s contextually-aware, generative capabilities that can interact with multiple apps. Asking something like \u201cWhere should I have lunch?\u201d gave me a list of businesses with lunch in the name followed by Siri asking me: \u201cWhich one?\u201d Not sure what that meant. Gemini, on the other hand, gave me local and relevant ideas for places I\u2019d actually want to eat.\n\nEven before AI swallowed everyone\u2019s mind, I had a soft spot for digital assistants. When Alexa sings the \u201cYou\u2019re very, very, oh so very welcome\u201d song, I get a dopey smile on my face. I\u2019ve tried to love Siri, but I get frustrated by being misunderstood, misdirected, misheard and flat-out ignored. I know Apple doesn\u2019t like to release new tech until it\u2019s fully up to snuff, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what finally happens with new Siri. But for now, the disparity shows.\n\nThe changes watchOS 26 brings to the Apple Watch are perhaps not as grand as those for other Apple devices. Liquid Glass here isn\u2019t as all-encompassing as it is on the iPhone. The new watch features don\u2019t make the wearable finally realize its full potential like iPad OS 26 does for the tablet. And there isn\u2019t one major feature upgrade that transforms the watch experience, like macOS 26 does with Spotlight on Macs.\n\nBut the updates do push the experience of using the watch forward. Liquid Glass is pretty and nicely ties the wearable with its companion devices. The Workout app, which was already good at tracking fitness metrics, is even better with the Workout Buddy, providing stat summaries and automated playlists. Improved smart replies for Messages and the addition of the Notes app fix two of the watch\u2019s previous shortcomings. And the wrist flick adds another option for hands-free interaction and \u2014 I hope \u2014 is a precursor to more such utility. I\u2019m still holding out hope for an improved, personable and helpful Siri once Apple is ready, but for now, these are all welcome upgrades for what\u2019s already the industry\u2019s best overall smartwatch.",

      "text": "Apple Intelligence: What devices and features will actually be supported?\nWhat will iPhone 15 Pro owners get, and what's in iOS 18 for everyone else?\nApple Intelligence is coming, but not to every iPhone out there. In fact, you'll need to have a device with an A17 Pro processor or M-series chip to use many of the features unveiled during the Apple Intelligence portion of WWDC 2024. That means only iPhone 15 Pro owners (and those with an M-series iPad or MacBook) will get the iOS 18-related Apple Intelligence (AI?) updates like Genmoji, Image Playground, the redesigned Siri and Writing Tools. Then there are things like Math Notes and Smart Script on iPadOS 18 and the new features in Messages coming via iOS 18 that will be arriving for anyone that can upgrade to the latest platforms. It's confusing, and the best way to anticipate what you're getting is to know what processor is in your iPhone, iPad or Mac.\nWhy won't the iPhone 14 Pro get Apple Intelligence?\nIt's not evident exactly why older devices using an A16 chip (like the iPhone 14 Pro) won't work with Apple Intelligence, given its neural engine seems more than capable compared to the M1. A closer look at the specs sheets of those two processors show that the main differences appear to be in memory and GPU prowess. Specifically, the A16 Bionic can only support a maximum of 6GB of RAM onboard while the M1 starts at 8GB and goes up to 16GB. In fact, all the supported devices have at least 8GB of RAM and that could hint at why your iPhone 14 Pro will not be able to handle making Genmojis, perhaps.\nThough it might not seem quite fair that owners of a relatively recent iPhone won't get to use Apple Intelligence features, you'll still be getting a healthy amount of updates via iOS 18. Here's a quick breakdown of what is coming via iOS 18, and what's only coming if your iPhone supports Apple Intelligence.\nWhat iOS 18 features will be coming to iPhones?\nBasically everything described during the iOS portion of yesterday's WWDC 2024 keynote is coming to all iPhones (that can update to iOS 18). That includes the customizable home screen, Control Center, dedicated Passwords app, redesigned Photos app, new Tapback emoji reactions, text effects, scheduled sending and more. Messages via Satellite is only coming to iPhone 14 or newer, and you'll be able to send text messages, emojis and Tapbacks, but not images or videos.\nYou'll also be tied to the same satellite service plan that you got at the time of your purchase of an iPhone 14. If you bought your iPhone 14 in January 2024, you received a free two-year subscription to be able to use Emergency SOS via Satellite and other satellite communication features that now include texting. That means that to continue texting people via satellite after January 2026, you'll need to start paying for a plan.\nThere are a whole host of updates coming with iOS 18 that Apple didn't quite cover in its keynote either, and I'll be putting up a separate guide about that in a bit. But suffice to say that apps like Maps, Safari, Calendar and Journal are getting new functions that, together with the other changes mentioned so far, add up to a meaty OS upgrade.\nWhat Apple Intelligence features are older devices missing out on?\nIn short, all of them. If you have an iPhone 15 Pro or an iPad (or Mac) with an M-series chip, you'll get a redesigned Siri, Genmoji and Image Playground, as well as writing tools baked into the system. That means tools like proofreading, summarizing or helping you adjust your tone in apps like Mail, Notes and Keynote are limited to the AI-supported devices. If you don't have one of those, you'll get none of this.\nThe redesigned Siri, which is only coming through Apple Intelligence, will be able to understand what's on your screen to contextually answer your queries. If you've been texting with your friend about which baseball player is the best, you can ask Siri (by long pressing the power button or just saying Hey Siri) \"How many homeruns has he done?\" The assistant will know who \"he\" is in this context, and understand you're referring to the athlete, not the friend you're chatting with.\nApple Intelligence is also what brings the ability to type to Siri \u2014 and you can invoke this keyboard to talk to the assistant by double tapping the bottom of the screen.\nThis also means that new glowing edge animation that appears when Siri is triggered is limited to the Apple Intelligence-supported devices. You'll still be looking at that little orb at the bottom of your screen when you talk to the assistant on an iPhone 14 Pro or older.\nThere are loads more features coming via Apple Intelligence, which appears to be set for release later this year.\nCatch up here for all the news out of Apple's WWDC 2024.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 public beta: Everything you need to know about the new Apple updates\nExciting changes are coming to your iPhone this fall, including a new aesthetic called Liquid Glass.\nIn just over a month, we'll finally get to download the official iOS 26 on our iPhones. Available now is the iOS 26 developer beta 6 (for developers only), and the public beta which you can download and install now. CEO Tim Cook recently said it's (along with the other current beta operating systems) \"by far the most popular developer betas we\u2019ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports. You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant \u2014 first promised at WWDC 2024 \u2014 is delayed until some point \"in the coming year,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity. With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.\nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it \u2014 version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year \u2014 the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"new translucent material\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some \u2014 including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar \u2014 like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nPhotos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.\nNew lock screen options: The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nMultitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheckout our first impressions of iPadOS 26.\nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nEnhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS \u2014 iPhone XR, XS and XS Max \u2014 won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update.\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\nNot listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September.\nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 \u2014 exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

      "text": "iOS 26 beta preview: Liquid Glass is better than you think\nApple\u2019s big design shift adjusts to fit reality.\nAt WWDC 2025, Apple revealed a major visual shake-up for iOS (not to mention the rest of the company\u2019s operating systems). This is the biggest change, aesthetically, since the shift away from the stitching, textures and skeuomorphic design of the iOS 4. It also comes with significantly fewer AI and Siri updates this time around. However, it\u2019s the smaller touches that make iOS 26 seem like a notable improvement over its predecessor.\nI\u2019ve been running the iOS 26 developer beta for the last two weeks and here's how Apple\u2019s new Liquid Glass design \u2014 and iOS 26 broadly \u2014 stacks up.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy or unstable software that could cause some of your apps to not work. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your data before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nLiquid Glass changes everything\niOS 26 looks new and modern. And for once, how Apple describes it \u2014 liquid glass \u2014 makes sense: it\u2019s a lot of layers of transparent elements overlapping and, in places, the animations are quite\u2026 liquidy. Menus and buttons will respond to your touch, with some of them coalescing around your finger and sometimes separating out into new menus.\nLiquid Glass encompasses the entire design of iOS. The home and lock screens have been redesigned once again, featuring a new skyscraping clock font that stretches out from the background of your photos, with ever-so-slight transparency. There\u2019s also a new 3D effect that infuses your photos with a bit of spatial magic, offering a touch of Vision Pro for iPhone users.\nThe experience in the first few builds of the iOS 26 beta was jarring and messy, especially with transparent icons and notifications, due to those overlapping elements making things almost illegible. Updates across subsequent releases have addressed this issue by making floating elements more opaque. There is also a toggle within the Accessibility tab in Settings to reduce transparency further, but I hope Apple offers a slider so that users can choose exactly how \u201cliquid\u201d they want their \u201cglass\u201d to be. If you own other Apple products, then you\u2019ll come to appreciate the design parity across your Mac, iPad and Apple Watch.\nOne noticeable change I'd been waiting for was the iOS search bar\u2019s relocation to the bottom of the screen. I first noticed it within Settings, but it reappears in Music, Podcasts, Photos and pretty much everywhere you might need to find specific files or menu items now. If, like me, you\u2019re an iPhone Pro or Plus user, you may have struggled to reach those search bars when they were at the top of the screen. It\u2019s a welcome improvement.\nVisual Intelligence\nWith iOS 26 on iPhones powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence, the company is bringing Visual Intelligence over to your screenshots. (Previously it was limited to Camera.) Once you\u2019ve grabbed a shot by pressing the power and volume up buttons, you\u2019ll get a preview of your image, surrounded by suggested actions that Apple Intelligence deduced would be relevant based on the contents of your screenshot.\nManaging Editor Cherlynn Low did a deep dive on what Visual Intelligence is capable of. From a screenshot, you can transfer information to other apps without having to switch or select them manually. This means I can easily screenshot tickets and emails, for example, to add to my calendar. Apple Intelligence can also identify types of plants, food and cars, even. If there are multiple people or objects in your screenshot, you can highlight what you want to focus on by circling it. There aren\u2019t many third-party app options at this point, but that\u2019s often the case with a beta build. These are features that Android users have had courtesy of Gemini for a year or two, but at least now we get something similar on iPhones.\nOne quick tip: Make sure to tap the markup button (the little pencil tip icon) to see Visual Intelligence in your screenshots. I initially thought my beta build was missing the feature, but it was just hidden behind the markup menu.\nMore broadly, Apple Intelligence continues to work well, but doesn't stand out in any particular way. We\u2019re still waiting for Siri to receive its promised upgrades. Still, iOS 26 appears to have improved the performance of many features that use the iPhone\u2019s onboard machine learning models. Since the first developer build, voice memos and voice notes are not only much faster, but also more accurate, especially with accents that the system previously struggled with.\nApple Intelligence\u2019s Writing tools \u2014 which I mainly use for summarizing meetings, conference calls and even lengthy PDFs \u2014 doesn't choke with more substantial reading. On iOS 18, it would struggle with voice notes longer than 10 minutes, trying to detangle or structure the contents of a meeting. I haven\u2019t had that issue with iOS 26 so far.\nGenmoji and Image Playground both offer up different results through the update. Image Playground can now generate pictures using ChatGPT. I\u2019ll be honest, I hadn\u2019t used the app since I tested it on iOS 18, but the upgrades mean it has more utility when I might want to generate AI artwork, which can occasionally reach photorealistic levels.\nOne useful addition is ChatGPT\u2019s \u201cany style\u201d option, meaning you can try to specify the style you have in mind, which can skirt a little closer to contentious mimicry \u2014 especially if you want, say, a frivolous image of you splashing in a puddle, Studio Ghibli style.\nApple also tweaked Genmoji to add deeper customization options, but these AI-generated avatars don\u2019t look like me? I liked the original Genmoji that launched last year, which had the almost-nostalgic style of 2010 emoji, but still somehow channeled the auras of me, my friends and family. This new batch are more detailed and elaborate, sure, but they don\u2019t look right. Also, they make me look bald. And contrary to my detractors, I am not bald. Yet. This feels like a direct attack, Apple.\nYou might feel differently, however. For example, Cherlynn said that the first version of Genmoji did not resemble her, frequently presenting her as someone with much darker skin or of a different ethnicity, regardless of the source picture she submitted.\nStill, the ability to change a Genmoji\u2019s expression, as well as add and remove glasses and facial hair through the new appearance customization options, is an improvement.\nA Camera app redesign for everyone\nApple has revisited the camera app, returning to basics by stripping away most of the previously offered modes and settings \u2014 at least initially \u2014 to display only video and photo modes.\nYou can swipe up from the bottom to see additional options, like flash, the timer, exposure, styles and more. You can also tap on the new six-dot icon in the upper right of the interface for the same options, though that requires a bit more of a reach. These behave in line with the new Liquid Glass design and you\u2019ll see the Photo pill expand into the settings menu when you press either area. Long-pressing on icons lets you go deeper into shooting modes, adjusting frame rates and even recording resolutions.\nWhat I like here is that it benefits casual smartphone photographers while keeping all the settings that more advanced users demand. None of the updates here are earth-shattering, though. I hope Apple takes a good look at what Adobe\u2019s Project Indigo camera app is doing \u2014 there are a lot of good ideas there.\nOne extra improvement if you use AirPods: Pressing and holding the stem of your AirPod (if it has an H2 chip) can now start video recording.\nApple Music tries to DJ\nAlongside the Liquid Glass design touches, the big addition to Apple Music this year is AutoMix. Like a (much) more advanced version of the crossfade feature found on most music streaming apps, in iOS 26, Music tries to mix between tracks, slowing or speeding up tempos, gently fading in drums or bass loops before the next song kicks in. Twenty percent of the time, it doesn\u2019t work well \u2014 or Apple Music doesn\u2019t even try. But the new ability to pin playlists and albums is useful, especially for recommendations from other folks that you never got around to listening to.\nMessages get a little more fun\nApple is making Messages more fun. One of the ways it\u2019s doing so is by enabling custom backgrounds in chats, much like in WhatsApp. I immediately set out to find the most embarrassing photo of my colleague (and frenemy) Cherlynn Low and make it our chat background. I know she\u2019s also running iOS 26 in beta, so she will see it. [Ed. note: Way to give me a reason to ignore your messages, Mat!]\nApple\u2019s Live translation now works across Messages, voice calls and FaceTime. Setting things up can be a little complicated \u2014 you\u2019ll first need to download various language files to use the feature. There\u2019s also some inconsistency in the languages supported across the board. For instance, Mandarin and Japanese are supported in Messages, but not on FaceTime yet. In chats, if your system language is set to English or Spanish, then you\u2019ll only be able to translate into English or Spanish. For those polyglots out there, if you want to translate incoming Japanese texts into German, you\u2019ll need to set your device's language to German.\nWhile I didn\u2019t get to flex my Japanese abilities on voice calls and FaceTime, iOS 26 was more than capable of keeping up with some rudimentary German and Spanish. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d rely on it for serious business translation or holiday bookings, but I think it could be a very useful tool for basics.\nThere\u2019s also the ability to filter spam messages to their own little folder (purgatory). Spam texts remain a nightmare, so I appreciate any potential weapons in the fight. Sadly, it hasn\u2019t quite manage to deal with the TikTok marketing agencies and phone network customer services that continue to barrage my Messages. Still, hopefully Apple will continue to improve its detection algorithms.\nOne more tool in the battle against spam: You can mute notifications for Messages from unknown numbers, although time-sensitive alerts from delivery services and rideshare apps will still reach you.\nNew apps are hit-or-miss\nNot everything in the beta lands, however. I\u2019ve already touched on how Liquid Glass was initially a semi-transparent mess. The Games App, too, seems like an unnecessary addition. Because it\u2019s a blend of the Games tab of the App Store and a silo of your preinstalled games, I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s adding. It\u2019s not any easier to navigate, nor does it introduce me to games I want to buy.\nCherlynn did want to highlight that for a casual gamer like herself, it\u2019s intriguing to see if the Games app might start to recommend more mind-numbing puzzles or farming simulations. She was also intrigued by the idea of a more social gaming experience on iOS, issuing challenges to her friends. Still, because the phone she has been testing the beta on doesn\u2019t have access to all her contacts or her gaming history, the recommendations and features are fairly limited at the moment.\nGames is one of two new apps that will automatically join your home screen. (Fortunately, they can be uninstalled). The other is Preview, which should be a familiar addition to any Mac user. It offers an easy way to view sent or downloaded files, like menus, ticket QR codes and more. During the developer beta, the app pulled in a handful of my documents that previously lived in the Files app. Navigation across both those apps is identical, although Preview is limited to files you can actually open, of course.\nAirPods, upgraded\nThis is more iPhone-adjacent, but iOS 26 includes several quality-of-life improvements for some of Apple\u2019s headphones. First up: notifications when your AirPods are fully charged, finally! The Apple Watch got this kind of notification back in iOS 14, so it\u2019s great to see Apple\u2019s headphones catch up.\nApple is also promising \u201cstudio-quality sound recording\u201d from the AirPods, augmenting recordings with computational audio improvements. There\u2019s a noticable bump in audio quality. It appears that AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 will record files at a sample rate of 48 kHz, which is double the rate used in the past. The sample rate bump happened last year, but it is dependent on what the app you're using. Is it \u201cstudio quality\u201d? I don\u2019t think so, but it\u2019s an improvement. While recordings sound slightly better in quiet locations, the bigger change is in loud environments. The algorithm doesn't appear to be degrading audio quality as much while trying to reduce background noise.\niOS 26 also adds sleep detection to the buds. If the AirPods detect minimal movement, they\u2019ll switch off automatically, which could be helpful for the next time I\u2019m flying long-haul.\nWrap-up\nIn iOS 26, Apple has prioritized design changes and systemwide consistency over AI-centric software and features. While Liquid Glass is a big change to how your iPhone looks, Apple has drawn from user feedback to finesse the design into feeling less jarring and gelling better when the home screen, Control Center and Notification drop-downs overlap with each other.\nThere are numerous quality of life improvements, including Messages and Visual Intelligence, in particular. If anything, the AI elephant in the room is the lack of any substantial updates on Siri. After the company talked up advanced Siri interactions over a year ago, I\u2019m still waiting for its assistant to catch up with the likes of Google."

      "text": "Apple Watch is live with Double Tap \u2014 how to customize the gesture on watchOS 10.1\nDouble Tap gestures are available on Apple Watch now that Apple has released updates to iOS 17 and watchOS 10.\nDouble Tap is arguably the killer feature in the new Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. The gesture is Apple\u2019s answer to the problem of using a smartwatch when your opposite hand is holding a bag of groceries, dog leash, flashlight or anything else. In addition, it can be a splendid accessibility feature for people with disabilities that could limit arm or hand mobility. Although the company only offers limited customization of the feature at launch, you can tweak a couple of settings to fine-tune Double Tap to your liking.\nUpdate to watchOS 10.1\nBefore you can use Double Tap, you\u2019ll need to ensure your Apple Watch is up-to-date. It requires at least watchOS 10.1, which Apple rolled out to customers on October 25. First, you need to update your paired iPhone to at least iOS 17.1, which became available the same day. You can do that on your phone in Settings > General > Software Update.\nAfter upgrading your phone\u2019s firmware, open the Apple Watch app on your paired phone, and then go to General > Software Update. Tap \u201cInstall\u201d and wait for the update to complete. Your watch must be charged to at least 50 percent while on its charger to initiate the installation.\nHow to customize Double Tap on your Apple Watch\nAlthough Apple may offer more customization in future software updates, Double Tap currently only lets you change how it handles audio playback and the Smart Stack. The latter, new in watchOS 10, is the pile of widgets you view from your watch face by swiping up from the bottom of the screen or scrolling up with the Digital Crown.\nFirst, open the Apple Watch app on your paired iPhone to customize these categories. Select Gestures > Double Tap, and then choose from the available options:\nPlayback lets you choose between pinching your fingers to play / pause (the default) or skip to the next track while listening to music or podcasts.\nSmart Stack chooses how Double Taps navigates the pile of widgets. \u201cAdvance\u201d means each tap moves to the next widgets (default), while \u201cSelect\u201d will select the first widget with a subsequent tap.\nWhat are the Double Tap gestures for Apple Watch?\nAfter activating Double Tap, you can play around with all the things it can do. They include:\nAudio playback: Pause / resume or (after changing the setting above) skip to the next track.\nPhone calls: Answer or hang up a call.\nNotifications: Initiate the primary action from any alert. For example, reply to a message or snooze a reminder. (It works with third-party apps too.)\nSmart Stack: Scroll through widgets from any watch face.\nView messages: Read a full message when you receive a new text.\nReply to messages: Reply with voice dictation when you get to the end of the message. Another Double Tap will confirm sending after you finish speaking.\nRead longer notifications: After opening an alert that doesn\u2019t fit entirely on the screen, double-tap again to scroll through one that\u2019s too long to display on your Apple Watch\u2019s screen. You can repeat this until you\u2019re at the end.\nAlarm: Snooze an alarm.\nStopwatch: Stop or resume a stopwatch.\nTimers: When viewing a timer, pause (if it\u2019s running), resume (if paused) or end the timer.\nRemote shutter: Take a photo on your iPhone when using the Apple Watch\u2019s Camera Remote.\nWorkout: Start or stop automatic Workout reminders if it detects that you\u2019re exercising without having started a workout on your watch.\nWhen you use Double Tap, a blue hand icon appears at the top of your watch\u2019s screen. If you try double-tapping on something that isn\u2019t compatible with the feature, the icon will appear and shake back and forth like it\u2019s saying, \u201cNo.\u201d\nHow to disable Double Tap on Apple Watch\nIf you navigate back to Settings > Gestures > Double Tap on your paired iPhone, you\u2019ll see an option to disable the feature if you\u2019re in a situation where you worry about triggering it accidentally. If you do that, you can always return to the same settings screen to re-enable Double Tap.\nIf you\u2019re still on the fence about the Apple Watch models that support Double Tap, you can visit Engadget\u2019s Apple Watch Series 9 review and our impressions of the Apple Watch Ultra 2."

      "text": "macOS 26 beta preview: Spotlight's time to shine\nApple's Liquid Glass refresh looks good, but the Spotlight is the big draw.\nI've learned not to expect much from macOS updates \u2014 not through sheer cynicism, but from the obvious reality that Apple pays far more attention to iOS and iPadOS than its desktop platform. I get it. macOS is a thing of the past, while smartphones and tablets are Apple's profitable present and future. But still, I think Mac users deserve more than just widgets, or the ability to merely mirror their iPhones (a feature that's not only genuinely useful, but also cements how crucial iPhones are to Apple and its users today). Now with macOS 26, Apple is finally showing a bit more love to its laptops and desktops.\nAfter testing the macOS Tahoe 26 developer beta for a few weeks, it definitely feels like a more substantial update than the last few versions. The revamped Spotlight alone will likely delight Mac diehards, since it makes it easier to find apps and perform all manner of tasks without requiring your fingers leave the keyboard. Add in a lovely visual refresh thanks to Apple's Liquid Glass design, as well as enhanced iPhone continuity features, and you have an operating system that feels like a genuine step forward for the Mac faithful.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy or unstable software that could cause some of your apps to not work. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your data before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nSpotlight becomes more than a search engine\nI've never been a heavy Spotlight user, aside from the few times I've needed to quickly look for an app or file. But in macOS Tahoe 26, it's suddenly a lot more useful. Now Spotlight can also help you find specific files; search cloud file services and websites; run Apple shortcuts and automations; and even run basic commands, like looking up your recent screenshots when you type \"/screenshot.\" Spotlight has become more than just a search engine for your Mac, it's practically a super-powered command line. (And notably, it has no real equivalent on Windows. So once again, Mac power users will be able to gloat about the supremacy of macOS.)\nOver the course of my testing, tapping the command key and space bar to trigger Spotlight practically became second nature. I'd bring it up to find files, as usual, but I noticed that it was better at unearthing what I was looking for than before. Spotlight also replaced my usual practice of typing in search strings in Safari or Chrome's address bar. It takes just a few seconds to bring up Spotlight, type \"YouTube,\" hit tab to trigger the search box and type in the video I'm looking for. This intelligent site searching also works for Amazon and IMDB \u2014 hopefully, Apple will add more commonly used sites over time (or perhaps just the ability to map a site's internal search engine to Spotlight).\nIf you're often buried by tons of tabs in your web browser, Spotlight can also quickly search through them. That helped me avoid getting distracted by social media and Slack conversations. I could just stay in my productivity flow, since I didn't have to sift through multiple app windows and tabs. The ability to trigger actions from Spotlight was similarly useful \u2014 it's a cinch to pop it up, start typing \"Send Message\" and jot out a quick text to my wife. Spotlight also learns your most common commands over time, so now I just have to type \"se\" for the Send Message action to pop up.\nI'm sure for a certain type of Mac power user, Spotlight will give them far fewer reasons to ever touch their mouse or trackpad.\nA more refined user interface with Liquid Glass\nWhile Spotlight is the most powerful upgrade in macOS Tahoe 26, you'll notice the spiffier Liquid Glass interface first. As with iOS 26, it basically amounts to more transparencies and visual flourishes spread throughout the OS. The menu bar at the top of the screen is now fully transparent, instead of looking foggy like before. It's not much, but it does make your Mac's screen seem a little bigger (or perhaps that may have just been extra noticeable on the cramped 13-inch MacBook Air I've been testing on).\nSimilarly, widgets and the Control Center dropdown have more glass-like visual elements that make them look a bit more modern. There's no real practical advantage, but to paraphrase a classic Marge Simpson quote, I just think it's neat. Apple Silicon-equipped hardware has more than enough graphics power to spare, so these visual upgrades also don't hinder performance at all. I didn't notice any slowdown during my testing, and according to Activity Monitor, there didn't seem to be a big hit to CPU or GPU usage.\nBetter iPhone integration\nEven though you've been able to make phone calls on Macs for a while now through FaceTime, it's taken until macOS Tahoe 26 for Apple to debut a dedicated Phone app. The app itself is nothing special \u2014 it gives you a quick glance at your contacts and recent calls, all in a compact Liquid Glass window \u2014 but at least it's a more logical place for phone calls.\nEven better than the standalone app, though, is the addition of iPhone Live Activities appearing in the macOS Tahoe 26 menu bar. That makes it easier to keep track of an inbound Uber or Doordash order, without whipping out your phone. And if you need to tap into a specific activity, macOS will also automatically launch the app from your phone via iPhone mirroring. It's the sort of usability feature you'd expect from Apple, and notably it's also not easily replicable on Windows. (And sure, you can also view it as a way to keep iPhone users from straying to the dark side too.)\nOther useful upgrades\nThe more I dug into macOS Tahoe 26, the more intriguing it became. Here are a few other updates worth highlighting:\nThe Shortcuts app seems a lot more powerful now, especially with the addition of custom automations and Apple Intelligence-powered actions. You can have an automation trigger writing tools or Image Playgrounds, and there's also a new \"Use Model\" command that can tap into on-device AI models and ChatGPT. I'm still trying to wrap my head around building a complex automation, but conceivably it could let you do something like compare an audio transcript to text notes, according to Apple.\nSafari has received a Liquid Glass redesign that looks pretty polished. It's not nearly as transformative as the Safari iOS upgrade, which makes it easier to read websites on a small phone screen, but at least it looks nice.\nThe Notes app now has Apple Intelligence-powered reminders whenever you share content to it. That could help you unearth some key tasks from a large email.\nThe Photos app has also received the Liquid Glass treatment, and you can finally use Pinned Collections on Macs to keep your favorite photo groups handy.\nThe Apple Music app can now use AutoMix to intelligently blend songs together, similar to a DJ. I've been using this feature on iOS 26 a lot, and it's honestly delightful \u2014 so long as you're not a total gapless playback purist."

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2016Color: Black with Turquoise ZipperVerified PurchaseI purchased this to wear while riding my horse. My iphone is only a 5 but it lives in a clunky OtterBox. The phone fits into the pouch with ease and tons of room to spare. My main complaint is that while you can remove the phone with one hand you really need 2 to put it back into the holder. Once you're up on a horse both hands aren't always free enough for that sort of thing. Thankfully it's a great excuse to not be interrupted by calls and texts while I ride so that almost lands it in the \"pro\" list.\nWhen purchasing this item I worried that my very slender build and naturally high waist would result in some fitting issues. While this does tend to result in the SPIbelt inching up higher on me than it does the \"normal people\" models, it really doesn't actually bother me. The belt is plenty tight enough. (Which almost never happens! I was sure I was going to have to hem it shorter.) I even have room to tighten it if the belt stretches although it feels of decent enough quality that I don't expect that. Another pleasant surprise was that even after a hard work out I didn't get a gross patch of sweat just under the belt where the breeze couldn't wick it away. I'm not even sure how that's possible but it was a pleasant surprise.\nHorse people who might read this: I took this out for a brief XC school. It stayed secure, didn't bounce while we practiced bank after bank jump and fit neatly just beneath the edge of my XC vest. I personally had room to actually put it on over my vest if I wanted and it has enough stretch that I don't think I'd have to worry about it dropping down, etc. Plus you can get it in just about any color to match your outfit!\nFor sizing consideration I'm 5'8\", 121lbs and high waisted. Easy fit for me.\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2025Color: Black With Black Zipper (No Logo)Verified PurchaseThis was so helpful for my dip into distance running! Easy to attach the water bottle & gold some essentials\u2014and iPhone pro, gels, keys, airpods case, hand sanitizer. Stays snug, with minimal bounce, and super easy to put on/off with the clip.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2025Color: Reflective with Black ZipperVerified PurchaseLOVE THIS! I\u2019ve tried many other belts while running long distance and this one stays put. I love that you can adjust the size too. It fits my phone perfectly and is reflective. It is small, but I don\u2019t need much space as I don\u2019t carry a lot with me. Highly recommend guis for any runner!\n- Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025Color: Cloudy Grey with Black ZipperVerified PurchaseIt is lightweight and my phone fits perfectly, so it is just what I wanted and a great purchase for me. However I did get a bit concerned when I loosened the belt to try to find a comfortable fit. The product description claims \"belt fits waist sizes of 25\" through 47\" comfortably\". I'm a 75 year old woman. I had to totally extend the belt to its loosest setting in order for it to fit comfortably around my 38\" waist. If I clasped it around my 43\" hips the elastic had to stretch, which I'm sure would cause discomfort after a certain amount of time. Just something to be aware of!\n- Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2025Color: Reflective with Black ZipperVerified PurchaseAbsolutely perfect!

      "text": "iPadOS 26 preview: A long-awaited multi-tasking update pays off (so far)\nApple called this the biggest iPad update ever, and this time it's not hyperbole.\nI\u2019m not going to beat around the bush: iPadOS 26 and its new multitasking features are a game-changer for Apple\u2019s tablets. Pretty much ever since Steve Jobs introduced the iPad 15 years ago (!), Apple has tried to straddle two worlds. In one, the iPad is a super-simple, easy-to-use tablet with a gorgeous display and tons of good apps from the App Store for gaming, entertainment and light work. The other world is one where the iPad replaces your traditional computer, letting people do the serious work that\u2019s been typically reserved for a Mac or Windows PC. iPadOS has too often served as a hindrance to the latter goal over the years, particularly as the iPad Pro has gotten more powerful.\nThe Stage Manager multitasking experience Apple introduced with iPadOS 16 in 2022 was a major step towards making the iPad\u2019s software suitable for power users \u2014 but it was rather buggy at launch and not as flexible as iPad power users were hoping for. The calls to just put macOS on the iPad grew louder. But this year, Apple took a different approach: it brought crucial macOS features like the familiar \u201cstoplight\u201d window controls, the menu bar at the top of the screen and vastly improved window management tools to iPadOS 26. The result is an iPad experience where you can easily jump between multiple windowed apps set up just how you like and one where you go full screen to focus on your content. It\u2019s a massive refinement over the old Stage Manager experience and one that I think will finally satisfy iPad die-hards who want to push their tablets to the limit.\nBefore diving into the details, a quick word on betas and stability. As usual, Apple\u2019s public betas feel pretty stable and capable, but that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t run into weirdness here and there. App crashes, particularly with third-party apps, happened far more on this beta than with iPadOS 18. I\u2019m confident those things will be ironed out as more developers update their apps for the new OS, but you\u2019ll also run into things like UI inconsistencies and occasional stutters and jerkiness when jumping between apps. As we always say, think hard about what you\u2019re willing to put up with to try a beta, even the relatively stable public beta. After all, the final version of iPadOS 26 will be out in just a few months.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means, as Nate stated above, you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy software. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your data before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nMultitasking\nTime for the nitty-gritty. When you update to iPadOS 26, you\u2019ll be asked if you want to enable multitasking or have apps run in full screen mode only. When Apple says full screen only, they mean it. Past versions of iPadOS offered either Stage Manager or a basic, two-app split screen view with a third app available in a Slide Over window. The latter option is gone now, though you can still easily set up two or three apps side by side with iPadOS 26\u2019s window tiling features. You can use multitasking mode or full screen only, with no in between. I think that\u2019s a smart move, as plenty of people who use an iPad probably never use these multi-app features, and having a \u201cmultitasking on or off\u201d toggle keeps things simple.\nWhen you turn on multitasking mode, apps still open in full screen first \u2014 but you can grab any corner of the window to resize it or touch the top of the app and drag it around the screen. You could already do this with Stage Manager, so what really sets this new mode apart is how it interacts with other windows. Swiping up from the bottom of the display reveals the usual Home Screen view, but with your apps tucked to the side as a visual cue that you can add another app to that group. And, as before, you can move, resize and stack that app window wherever you want.\nAs I\u2019m writing this, I have nine separate app windows open on my iPad, and getting around them feels more Mac-like than ever before. I can swipe up and hold from the bottom of the Home Screen and see every open app in a smaller window, which makes finding the specific thing I want a lot easier; I can also just command-tab through them. Apps can be minimized down to the dock and when I want the app back, it\u2019ll pop open in the same size window and same placement as before. Swiping up from the bottom of the screen twice minimizes everything I have open to start fresh \u2014 but again, if I reopen those apps, they\u2019ll go back to exactly where I had them set up before.\nI realize it sounds kind of silly to make a big deal of this, but it\u2019s hard to overstate how much this improves the iPad multitasking experience. With Stage Manager, I was never quite sure where an app would open or if it would be full screen or windowed. It can be useful for setting up multiple groups of apps, but adding and removing apps from that view was not terribly intuitive. Just opening everything in one space is a lot more intuitive. And if you want to have various different spaces with specific apps, you can still turn on Stage Manager. It\u2019s a lot easier to add and remove apps from various different groups than it used to be; minimizing a window puts it into its own space that you can add more apps to (or just use it on its own).\nThere are a few other new components that make multitasking work as well as it does. These should be quite familiar to Mac users: The three-button \u201cstoplight\u201d controls and the menu bar. The stoplight buttons replace a similar three-dot window management system from older versions of iPadOS but are far more intuitive. The red one closes an app window entirely, the green one makes a window full screen and then yellow one minimizes it to the dock. These controls are crucial to making iPadOS 26 feel more flexible and fluid than ever before, particularly if you want to have more than one window of a single app open. I\u2019ve also found them to be crucial when working with multiple apps on a smaller display, like on the 11-inch iPad Pro. Stage Manager usually felt like more trouble than it was worth on anything but a 13-inch iPad, but these new multitasking features make it easy to flip through a bunch of apps and pop into full screen if I need more space.\nThe expanded window tiling controls here also make that easier. If you press and hold the stoplight buttons, you\u2019ll get more options to resize apps to take up a quarter, third or half the screen; you can also grab drag bars to further adjust how much space each app takes up. I really liked a mode where three iPhone-sized apps fill the screen, and when there was something I wanted to devote more focus to, I just hit its green button and went full screen.\nThe menu bar, meanwhile, is pretty easy to explain. If you swipe down from the top of the screen (or move your trackpad cursor up to the top) you\u2019ll see familiar menus like File, Edit, Window and so on. It\u2019s a handy way to find more advanced controls for an app, and it also keeps the various toolbars in apps from getting too overloaded with options.\nLong story short, this all adds up to a wildly improved iPad experience. It doesn\u2019t compromise the single-screen, focused mode that the iPad has always been known for, and it greatly improves working across multiple windows and apps. And unlike Stage Manager, which was limited to M-series iPads, these new multitasking features will work on any iPad that can run iPadOS 26, including the base A16 iPad and the iPad mini.\nEverything else\nIf this was the only change to iPadOS Apple made this year, it would already be a worthwhile upgrade, but there are a bunch of other improvements coming this fall. These include an improved Files app, the Preview app that has long been a core part of macOS, the new Liquid Glass design, some potentially useful Apple Intelligence features, a nice set of updates to the Messaging app and a new Phone app.\nMuch has been said about Liquid Glass, with tons of prognostication about how Apple was ruining usability and throwing its UI back to 2006 in a blatant Windows Aero ripoff. As usual, the truth is much more nuanced. No one familiar with Apple\u2019s software will be thrown off by this update \u2014 everything works as it did before, and while you\u2019ll definitely notice some refractive visual elements, it\u2019s not the wholesale change that aggrieved social media posters would have you believe. You can make things look very different if you, say, opt for the new clear glass icon look, but you can also leave the standard colorful iOS icons in place.\nOver the course of the developer betas Apple has released since WWDC, the company has responded to feedback and reduced some of the transparency effects that were present in the first version of Liquid Glass \u2014 as it turns out, submitting feedback during a beta works! (Interestingly, they bumped some of the transparency back up in the fourth developer beta, right after turning it down in beta 3. This is still a work in progress.) Probably the biggest functional change is that app controls, toolbars and sidebars float over apps in a new, distinct layer rather than being wholly separate from an app\u2019s content \u2014 but again, it\u2019s not the kind of thing that\u2019ll faze anyone who has been using an iPad or any other Apple device.\nPreview isn\u2019t exactly a thriller, but it\u2019s a much better way to work with PDFs and images than the old interface that launched them in a separate Files window. You can still find PDFs in Files easily enough, but actually dealing with the document in a separate app is better than making Files pull double duty.\nSpeaking of Files, it has even more in common with the Mac Finder than before. You can now put specific folders in the dock for faster access to whatever you\u2019re working on, and the app list view has resizable columns and collapsible folders, just like on the Mac. You can also add emoji and colors to folders for more visual differentiation (and, let\u2019s be honest, a little more fun). And for the first time, you can pick specific apps to open different file types by default \u2014 so if you\u2019d rather have PNG images open in Photomator than Preview, go nuts.\nThere are also major updates to the communication experience across the board in iPadOS 26. The FaceTime app got a nice redesign with large contact posters of your recent calls. But what\u2019s most handy here is that the FaceTime app no longer tries to do double-duty with voice calls. A dedicated Phone app handles that now. Assuming you also have an iPhone, you\u2019ll see all your recent voice calls and voicemails here and you can quickly place a new call through your contact list or using a traditional dialer. I\u2019ve always liked the idea of being able to place calls on devices I\u2019m using during the work day like my Mac or iPad, and this makes it far easier.\nMessages is getting some fun visual enhancements like backgrounds for your conversations, but the thing I\u2019m most interested in is message filtering. The app now identifies unknown senders and puts those messages in a separate folder, and there\u2019s also a new spam folder where it drops messages that Apple strongly believes are spam.\nIf a message gets filtered into unknown senders or spam, you can mark it as known even if the contact isn\u2019t in your address book and those messages will end up in your main view by default. The system also attempts to recognize when a message from an unknown sender is timely and needs to be delivered to your main inbox \u2014 something like a delivery person saying they\u2019re nearby or other urgent content like a two-factor authentication code. This feels primarily like a phone-first feature; I get messages on my iPad, but haven\u2019t seen much get filtered directly to spam or unknown callers yet. Once all my devices are running Apple\u2019s latest software, we\u2019ll see how that goes, but I\u2019m still very excited about any feature that\u2019ll help combat the deluge of spam messages that plague my inbox.\nFor more details on the updated communications experience and other new features like the Apple Intelligence-powered Live Translation, I\u2019ll point you to my colleague Mat Smith\u2019s iOS 26 overview. As is usually the case, nearly every feature coming to the iPhone this year is also coming to the iPad, meaning Live Translation will arrive on the tablet too.\nThere\u2019s a lot more here that I haven\u2019t been able to get to, like improved background tasks that let you export a video without keeping the app in focus, updates to Genmoji and Image Playground, the Journal app finally coming to iPad, Apple Intelligence-powered Shortcuts updates and much more. I\u2019ll be continuing to check out how things change between now and the final release this fall, but even based on my experience with the recent beta, I\u2019m quite pleased with where iPadOS 26 is at. The updates to multitasking are so significant that I can\u2019t imagine going back to an iPad without them."

      "text": "The only thing I want from Apple's big 2025 redesign is a\nThat\u2019s a, not \u03b1.\nThere are a lot of rumors flying around about a big iOS and macOS redesign coming this year, perhaps as a distraction to the continued issues around Apple Intelligence. And while I\u2019m game for a fresh coat of paint across the software I use every single day, I have one plea while Apple\u2019s at it: Please, for the love of god, make the Notes app render the letter \u201ca\u201d properly.\nLet me back up a bit. Apple first introduced the San Francisco typeface with the first Apple Watch in 2015; a few years later it became the default on basically every device Apple sells. The text you see in Messages, Apple Music, Maps and many other system apps are all different San Francisco fonts, and for the most part the multiple variations all feel consistent and cohesive.\nBut, at some point in the last seven or eight years I noticed something odd in the Apple Notes app. The font appears the same as the other San Francisco fonts, but something just felt \u201coff.\u201d It took forever before I put my finger on it: the lowercase \u201ca\u201d renders differently in the Notes app than it does anywhere else across the entire system.\nYou see, the Notes app uses a \u201csingle storey a,\u201d the sort of \u201ca\u201d that most people use when writing by hand. That\u2019s the only first-party app, as far as I can tell, where you\u2019ll find a single-storey a. The rest of the time, it uses the double-storey a (just as you\u2019ll see on this website and almost everywhere else a lowercase a is used these days outside of handwriting).\nTo be clear, this does not matter even a little bit. In fact, the completely inconsequential and random nature of this situation is probably why it irks me so. Part of me is glad I figured out exactly what was throwing me off, because for years Notes just looked wrong in a way that I found impossible to describe. Now at least I know what my brain was reacting to.\nOne day recently we were having a lively discussion about fonts in the Engadget Slack, which triggered me to bring up this mystery. My colleagues both agreed that this was bizarre and also thought I was a bit of a lunatic for spending this much time thinking about a single character in a single app. This, of course, drove me to download and dig through all of Apple\u2019s system fonts and their variations to find the dreaded \u201cLatin small letter Alpha,\u201d or \u03b1, that our resident Greek Cypriot Aaron Souppouris suggested I search for. Indeed, that\u2019s what pops up in Notes instead of the usual \u201ca.\u201d It\u2019s not even one of the font variants, as far as I can tell. [Ed. note: Nathan did no other work during this time.]\nEven though this is a ridiculous thing to think about, I want to know what\u2019s going on here! How did this happen? Who made this decision, and for what reason? Maybe it\u2019s because the Notes app originally used a skeuomorphic \u201cMarker Felt\u201d sort of text that emulated handwriting \u2014 using the single storey \u201ca\u201d is perhaps a nod to how most people actually handwrite the letter. Or, perhaps, it\u2019s just something that slipped through the cracks years ago and hasn\u2019t been worth changing because most people probably haven\u2019t consciously noticed the difference (you\u2019re welcome).\nWhatever the reason, I sure would love it if Apple unified things with the iOS 19 (and corresponding macOS) redesign. I generally find the default Apple font to be just fine, though people certainly have their own very strongly held opinions about typography. But if I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019d also probably miss that oddball \u03b1 \u2014 it\u2019s always fun to have an unsolved mystery to ponder over, no matter how inconsequential.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "WWDC 2025: iOS 26, new Liquid Glass design and everything else Apple announced\nApple revealed a bunch of changes coming to iOS, iPadOS and macOS later this year; here's what you need to know.\nApple's WWDC 2025 keynote gave fans a good look into what their iPhones, iPads and Mac computers will look like come this fall when the new software updates come out. Key to the changes is Apple's new Liquid Glass design language, which will bring UI tweaks to all of its operating systems later this year. The redesign focuses on streamlining things and boosting productivity while giving most elements a semi-translucent look. As to be expected Apple Intelligence features are baked into all of the forthcoming software updates, and users can expect to see updated widgets, a few overhauled apps and more. Here's everything Apple announced at WWDC 2025 this year.\nLiquid Glass design and new software names\nAs was expected, Apple revealed a new visual design language coming to all of its operating systems dubbed Liquid Glass. It called this new system its \"broadest\" design update yet, and it features semi-translucent features like redesigned widgets, notifications and more. Apple is billing it as more dynamic than the previous design language, and a way to bring even more consistency across all operating systems including iOS, iPadOS and macOS.\nIn addition to the redesign, Apple is revamping the names of all of its operating systems. Instead of iOS 19, for example, we\u2019ll have iOS 26 coming out this fall. iPadOS 26, watchOS 26 and others will follow suit, marking the first time Apple has given its software updates year identifiers instead of arbitrary generation numbers.\niOS 26\nThe changes coming to iOS 26 are subtle, but they give it a clean look and feel, with lots of overlapping elements, rounded corners and more. Apple said the design is inspired by visionOS, the operating system that powers Vision Pro headsets. App icons have a slightly different look, while toolbars and text inputs have see-through appearances. Folks will be happy to know that things are largely the same \u2014 you shouldn't have an issue identifying key apps like the Phone, Messages or FaceTime.\nPhone app\nSpeaking of the Phone app, it's getting the biggest redesign since its launch with the original iPhone all those years ago. It puts scrolling front and center, allowing you to scroll through key contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. A translucent bar at the bottom of the screen gives you quick access to additional contacts and the keypad. Hold Assist, a new feature, will mute hold music but keep you on a call until someone picks up on the other line.\nMessages\nMessages is getting a few new features as well, including the ability to change the entire message background color for group messages and polls among group chat members. New screening features includes \"unknown senders,\" which sequesters those pesky spam messages to a separate space in Messages, so you can keep your most important conversations in the forefront and ignore those that don't matter.\nApple Intelligence features are spread throughout all of the software updates, and in Messages, there are some related to Genmoji. In iOS 26, you'll be able to combine two existing emoji to create an entirely new, custom Genmoji, and you can even use ChatGPT to create Genmoji as well.\nLive translate is coming to Messages, too, automatically translating messages as you type and delivering them to the receiver in their preferred language. Similarly functioning live captions will be available in FaceTime, and Apple Music will get live translation and live pronunciation features to help listeners enjoy music in other languages. The Call Translation API will be available to third-party developers to use in their communication apps as well.\nMaps and Wallet\nApple Maps will gain the ability to learn your routine and suggest alternative routes based on traffic. It will also log your \"visited places\": cities, landmarks and business that you've been to, making it easier for you to find places you want to revisit again.\nSeparately, the Wallet app will support Digital ID, which lets you create a digital ID that's different from your driver's license and passport and can be used to verify your identity in some locations. You'll also be able to add updated boarding passes to Wallet when you're flying.\nGames app\niOS 26 will feature a dedicated Games app as well. It will feature a Library tab, where you can find all of the games you've ever downloaded for iOS, and a dedicated Apple Arcade tab for all of the titles included in that service. Challenges is a new feature will let you compete against friends in supported games, including supported single-player games that developers.\nVisual Intelligence\nVisual Intelligence is getting baked into iOS 26's interface a bit more, allowing you to visually search for anything that pops up on your iPhone screen. For example, if there's an image of a jacket you like on your social media feed, you can take a screenshot and use the new Visual Intelligence image search feature to search for similar jackets across the web and other apps. You can highlight certain areas of your screenshot to refine the search further.\nwatchOS 26\nIn addition to the Liquid-Glass visual overhaul, watchOS 26 will bring Workout Buddy to your wrist. The new feature will analyze your fitness history and identify insights in real time as you're working out. It takes shape as a sort of audio coach that can inform you of things like the distance you've run, average pacing and those compares to previous runs you've completed. New Apple Music integration can choose playlists for you as well, based on the type of workout you're doing.\nSmart Stack on Apple Watch is getting an update as well, prioritizing the information that matters most to you depending on your routine. For example, when you walk into your gym, a Smart Stack hint will appear on your watch that will quickly take you to the workout app so you can dive right into your training session.\nmacOS Tahoe\nThe next version of Apple's desktop operating system is dubbed macOS Tahoe, keeping the classic California naming scheme the company has been using for a long time. Liquid Glass design language is at the forefront here, but long-time Mac users will find most things look quite familiar, just with a semi-translucent, rounded edge now. Users will have the option to make custom backgrounds, change the color of their desktop folders and even add emoji to them.\niOS' Phone app will be available on macOS Tahoe, improving the calling capabilities of Mac computers. With it, you can more easily access your contacts and voicemail messages, and it will support all of the new features the new Phone app in iOS 26 will, including things like Hold Assist.\nIntelligent actions are coming to the Shortcuts app, which integrates Apple Intelligence into the existing Shortcuts program. This lets you access Apple Intelligence models on-device, creating your own Shortcuts with AI capabilities. In a similar vein, Spotlight will be more powerful in macOS Tahoe, allowing you to call upon and execute multi-step Shortcuts and actions directly from Spotlight search, without navigating to other apps. You can also use Spotlight to access your clipboard history in the latest software update, too.\niPadOS 26\niPadOS 26 will feature a Liquid Glass redesign along with most of the new features detailed for iOS 26, including the revamped Phone and Games apps. Unique for the iPad, though, is a new menu bar and windowing feature that makes the tablet's UI look and feel a lot more like macOS. That means it should improve multitasking, something iPad power-users have wanted for a long time. You can resize windows, snap them to different corners or swipe them away temporarily to get a glimpse of your home screen. Apple claims the window system is designed to work just as well with touch input (either via fingers or a stylus) or trackpads on compatible accessories.\nThe Files app on iPad will feature an updated list view and the same custom color options you'll find on the new macOS Tahoe. You'll also be able to choose which programs or apps you want to open certain files, so for example, you can opt to open an image in Photoshop rather than the default option. Speaking of, a new Preview app is coming to iPads in the new software update. A mainstay on macOS, this app will bring native PDF management, annotation and editing to Apple's tablets.\niPadOS 26 will bring a number of new features for podcasters and the like, including the ability to record \"studio quality\" vocals with AirPods. Users will also be able to press and hold their AirPods to start and stop the recordings they're making on their iPads. In addition, a new local capture feature will integrate with video conferencing apps to let users record their video on iPads for things like remote group podcasts.\nvisionOS 26\nThe next software update coming to Vision Pro systems will include new Apple Intelligence features, spatial experiences and more. Spatial widgets are coming to visionOS 26, allowing you to put, say, a calendar widget somewhere in your Vision Pro field of view and it will stay in that place even as you move around. Native and third-party apps can support spatial widgets, and they'll all be available in the new Widgets visionOS app.\nSpatial scenes is a new feature that uses AI to bring your photos to life in front of your eyes while using Vision Pro. Spatial scenes also extend to photos you'll see while browsing, so for example, those travel photos you see while researching your next vacation will look even more lifelike using spatial scenes.\nArguably the most exciting visionOS news is that it will allow the Vision Pro headset to be used with PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers. This will make Vision Pro more of a contender in the gaming space, since lack of compatible controllers was a big factor holding it back. In addition, the new software update will bring eye-scrolling to the Vision Pro, which will allow users to scroll documents, apps, webpages and more just by using their eyes.\ntvOS 26\nThe new Liquid Glass design language brings more cinematic film and TV art to the Apple TV app in tvOS 26. A new Profiles feature in Apple TV+ lets you customize your viewing experience with your own tastes, and each member of your household can have their own profile. Elsewhere, Apple Music on Apple TV is getting a karaoke-esque feature that lets you sing along to your favorite songs using your iPhone as the microphone."

Last week, I penned a work-in-progress version because I hadn\u2019t yet spent enough time to fully explore the new features Samsung packed into the Galaxy Watch 8. One of those features is the new AI-powered running guidance, which I followed.\nI have run more in the past week than I ever have before. In my life. Ever. But I\u2019m pretty sure my editors would still appreciate the full assessment I\u2019ve proposed, so I\u2019ve plied myself with caffeine and will do my best here.\nLuckily, most of what I experienced in my first few days with the watch still stands: I was impressed then and remain so now. Not only are there a few valuable health and fitness additions, but the redesigned hardware looks great as well. Plus, the on-watch integration with Google\u2019s Gemini has proven surprisingly seamless. (When AI interactions actually yield positive results, I\u2019m always taken aback.)\nSamsung also fixed not one but two of the complaints I had with the Galaxy Watch 7. Since the company probably didn\u2019t base its updates on my personal opinions, I imagine others had concerns over the comfort of the Watch 7 \u2014 and I know from other reviews that many people were disappointed in its battery life.\nBefore I get to Gemini, the redesign and exactly how my watch exhausted me, I want to discuss antioxidants. It\u2019s a compelling new health metric the Galaxy Watch can now measure \u2014 and despite my hard work, I scored miserably.\nThe redesigned Galaxy Watch 8 has a longer battery life and much more comfortable fit. The Gemini integration is actually helpful and the new health metrics and fitness guidance are useful.\n- Remarkably comfortable fit\n- Tiles interface is snappy\n- New antioxidant level and vascular load health metrics may help users keep an eye on their health\n- The running coach can be inspiring for beginners\n- Good Gemini integration\n- Improved battery makes the AOD more viable\n- The raised glass screen can be easily damaged\n- AI-running coach could be more personalized\n- Notifications are easy to miss\nAntioxidant tests and my persimmon intake\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 has the same processor and sensors as the previous generation, but it\u2019s using those to detect a new metric: antioxidant levels. You have to take the watch off and hold your thumb on the sensor node for five seconds to get a reading and you\u2019ll need to refer to the Health app in your phone for detailed results. The first time I tested, I got a score of 60, which falls right in the middle of the \u201clow\u201d segment of the scale. The only other results are \u201cvery low\u201d and \u201cadequate,\u201d which will surely be a disappointment to the over-achievers out there.\nThe Health app suggested I \u201ctry eating one (100g) persimmon today.\u201d When my grandmother was alive, she made persimmon cookies every Christmas and the last time she did so was also the last time I thought about that fruit. Considering South Korea is one of the world\u2019s largest persimmon producers, it might make sense that a Samsung device suggested them. The produce guy at my local grocery store said they only carry them around the holidays (no doubt because grandmas insist, plus that\u2019s when they\u2019re in season).\nTurns out persimmons are high in antioxidants such as Vitamin C and beta-carotene (Vitamin A). Cantaloupe also has those nutrients \u2014 plus it\u2019s orange like persimmons \u2014 so I bought one. In fact, I went hard on the antioxidants and did everything I could to see if I could get a better score. I ate a bunch of cherries and a little dark chocolate. For breakfast, I had half a cantaloupe instead of the very tasty-smelling breakfast hash my husband made, and I drank plain green tea instead of my usual oat matcha latte. I did yoga and went to my monthly medical massage appointment (stress is said to increase oxidant levels). I got eight hours of sleep and drank my weight in water. I felt ready.\nSo I took the test again and my antioxidant levels were\u2026 two points lower. Sigh. I wasn\u2019t expecting overnight transformation, but I\u2019d hoped for a little improvement. Next time, I\u2019m eating the hash. Taking the test on subsequent days \u2014 days that I did nothing special to improve my score \u2014 I never scored higher than 60 and dropped as low as 56. So it seems this is a metric that may take some time and effort to budge.\nFinally, a new design!\nSince its fourth generation, the Galaxy Watch has looked pretty much the same: a round glass screen set in a round metal case with large prongs popping out of the top and bottom to hold the band. While there was nothing wrong with sticking with a good design, giving a device a refreshed look lends the yearly update cycle some meaning \u2014 instead of feeling like an obligatory move to appease stockholders.\nThis time around, the Galaxy Watch 8 looks markedly different thanks to a shape borrowed from last year\u2019s Ultra model (and some high-end timepiece profiles). Samsung calls it a \u201ccushion design\u201d \u2014 a circular glass display set atop an aluminum case that looks like a roundish square (or squircle as our own Cherlynn Low calls it). The Sport band on my review model curves to meet the width of the case, creating a smooth arch that I think is more refined than the clunkier pronged configuration. In fact, the entire look is classy \u2014 much more so than the Apple Watch, which looks like a miniaturized iPhone 11 glued to a silicone strap.\nThe cushion design is great in one way, but also worrisome. Because the glass display stands proud of the case by at least two millimeters, my first thought was: \u201cI\u2019m going to trash this screen.\u201d Immediately after taking the watch out of the box, I ordered screen shields and, during the course of this review, managed to crack one. That\u2019s possibly because I was cheap and ordered off-brand screen protectors, or perhaps the protruding glass cushion is simply begging for misfortune.\nHowever, the raised glass solves one issue with the Galaxy Watch 7. One way to scroll is by running your finger along the outer edge of the screen. In fact, on-screen cues suggest that gesture when there\u2019s more content to view. On the Watch 7, my finger was always getting in the way of the text I wanted to read. Now that the display is elevated, there\u2019s room for my finger to travel further out along the outer edge and stay out of the way.\nAppearance aside, my favorite hardware update is the much more comfortable design. The Watch 7\u2019s underside had a sizable sensor node, and it took me a week to get used to the feel \u2014 I wrenched it off the first night I tried to wear it to sleep. The Watch 8, however, felt good the first time I put it on. And now that I\u2019ve spent more time with it, I can say it\u2019s the most comfortable watch I\u2019ve tested. I often forget I have it on and don\u2019t mind wearing it to bed, which is saying a lot. In fact, when I slept with it on one wrist and an Apple Watch Series 9 on the other to compare sleep data, I woke up in the middle of the night and took off the Apple Watch, but felt no compulsion to do the same with Samsung\u2019s model.\nGemini on your wrist and Wear OS 6\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 is the first smartwatch to ship with Google\u2019s Wear OS 6, though Samsung overlays it with its own One UI interface. The first time we\u2019ll get a look at the unfiltered wearable software will be on Google\u2019s upcoming Pixel Watch 4. The headline feature is Gemini integration. Now, most things you can do with the Gemini app on your phone can be done through your watch. Just note that you\u2019ll need to have your Gemini-compatible phone nearby to use it.\nGoogle\u2019s AI was pretty snappy at basic tasks like setting reminders and timers. Requests that required more \u201cthought\u201d took only marginally longer (and completed more quickly when I was using my home Wi-Fi versus relying on cell signals out in the world). I asked for the best record stores in my city and a good place to eat lunch. I was pleasantly surprised to hear of a new-to-me answer for each category. The record store turned out to be two bins of LPs inside a book shop, but still, I hadn\u2019t heard of it before. I asked why my eight-year-old talked about lava chicken all the time and was correctly informed about Jack Black and A Minecraft Movie.\nThe assistant displays answers in text form on the watch screen and also reads out every word. That can turn into a lot of talking, but tapping the screen stops the chatter if you prefer to read. Gemini can handle follow-up questions and tasks, but since it doesn\u2019t usually keep listening after it speaks, you have to tap the mic icon to make your next request.\nI reached out to Samsung to ask if I could change a setting to make Gemini keep listening, but there isn't one at this time. For now, you'll need to tap or say \"OK Google\" again for followups like, \u201cAdd that to my Google Keep\u201d or \u201cRemind me about that.\u201d If Gemini asks you a question, however, such as verifying a text it\u2019s about to send, it does keep listening for the answer. You can also combine commands at the outset, such as asking to look up an address and text it to someone.\nI requested some fairly specific tasks and didn\u2019t hit any snags. I asked it to text the address of a local restaurant to my husband and it verified which location I wanted then sent the message. I asked when the Albuquerque Isotopes were playing the Sacramento River Cats and it gave me the upcoming dates. I tapped the mic and said, \u201cAdd that to my calendar,\u201d which it did.\nIt only let me down twice. When I asked whether it was going to rain, it just read me the general weather forecast instead of answering the question. All the other assistants in my life (Alexa and Siri) can answer those questions \u2014 though technically that\u2019s a Gemini problem, not the watch's fault.\nThe other disappointment is a matter of integration. I was out on a walk and I asked for directions to a nearby grocery store. Gemini gave me the address and the distance, but told me to look at my phone for the actual directions. When I asked Siri the same thing on the same walk, directions simply showed up on my Apple Watch. (Yes, I\u2019ve been wearing two watches and carrying around two activated phones like a double agent, just much less cool.)\nIn addition to Gemini, Wear OS 6 introduces updated and larger tiles which organize and display information on your watch. By default, the tiles are separated into categories: Health, Fitness and Basic (weather, media playback, calendar) with each box displaying a bit of pertinent info \u2014 activity metrics, current temp, your next event and so on. If the limited info isn\u2019t enough, tapping a tile opens the respective app. You can categorize, rearrange, swap out and add as many pages of these cards as you want in the Wear app on your phone. I spent some time tweaking the layout to my liking, but really didn\u2019t alter the defaults too much. Already this feels like a much smarter way of interacting with a watch. Now you can glean key information from the apps that are important to you just by browsing your tiles.\nThe running coach made me mad, but it earned my respect\nThe Galaxy Watch 8\u2019s built-in, AI-fueled running guidance sounds a bit like the upcoming Workout Buddy that Apple announced for watchOS 26. I plan to test that out next and it will be interesting to compare the two. Google Pixel watches and Fitbits currently have the option of an AI-powered running coach, but it\u2019s limited to Premium subscribers. Garmin offers an adaptive training program called Run Coach as well, so this isn\u2019t an entirely novel idea.\nSamsung\u2019s running coach begins with an assessment: Run as fast as you can maintain for twelve minutes. You\u2019ll then be awarded a performance level ranging from one to ten. Each level comes with a tailored, four-week plan with four workouts per week intended to get you ready to complete a 5K, 10K, half or full marathon. My 12-minute, 22-second per-mile pace put me at a level three. My plan was geared towards getting me to run a sub-35-minute 5K at the end of four weeks.\nThe first workout was low-intensity interval running with four segments of running hard, interspersed with cool-down walks \u2014 which felt easy and attainable. Two days later I did the second routine, which had me run for thirty minutes at my assessment pace (which it referred to as a \u201cslow jog\u201d).\nFor the next session, I was told to run for 30 minutes on a hilly course. There was some walking on the inclines, but I completed it. After that, I was startled to see it wanted me to run for 3.1 miles with a target pace below 12 minutes. Yes, on workout four (of 15 total), I was supposed to run a 5K faster than my assessment pace. This felt unfair. Unhinged. Not nice. But in the name of proper gadget testing, I tried.\nDuring every run, the AI coach chimes in each minute with a pace update, letting you know whether you\u2019re going slower, faster or right around your target. You also get updates on your completion level, with a shout out at 30 percent, half way and 80 percent. Three or four times per session, the coach gives you some canned advice like telling you to focus on maintaining a consistent pace and not speed, reminding you that runs build cardiovascular health or suggesting that you cool down after a workout to avoid injury. You also get interjections like \u201cYou\u2019re doing great\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re almost done, finish strong.\u201d\nAt first, I hated the constant pace checkins. Once I hit the halfway point of the 5K, I started to lag. My watch told me over and over: \u201cYou\u2019re running slower than your target pace. Try to speed up if you can.\u201d I wheezed obscenities in response. But then, when I really just wanted to quit, I started to look forward to the next update, knowing it meant I\u2019d stayed on my feet for one more minute.\nUltimately, I ran faster and farther than I would have without a coach. I wouldn\u2019t have attempted a 5K, because that\u2019s just insane. Of course, I\u2019m a pretty easy win for Samsung\u2019s running coach. I\u2019m an optimistic person and I\u2019ve never been coached before, so anything that says it \"believes in me\u201d and pushes me to try something I don\u2019t think I can do is pretty likely to get some results. Samsung calls this an AI-powered regimen \u2014 and sure, it knew my pace, distance and heart rate and adjusted its encouragement accordingly \u2014 but I didn\u2019t hear anything uniquely personalized to me and my journey. But I still have three weeks to go.\nVascular load and bedtime reminders\nTwo new features require overnight data gathering. Vascular load takes readings while you sleep to evaluate the health of your circulatory system, then tells you when your load is higher or lower than normal and offers recommendations. It requires three nights of data to set a baseline. After that, you\u2019ll be able to check whether your load is higher, lower or steady.\nMy range has been lower or steady over the past few days. The internet tells me that a high vascular load can lead to bad things like hypertension and heart attacks. And the Health app offers suggestions to improve your vascular load, too \u2014 things like getting better sleep, being active, limiting stress and maintaining a healthy weight. Personally, this isn\u2019t an area I\u2019m concerned about, but considering the prevalence of heart disease, it\u2019s a good metric to keep an eye on..\nThree nights of sleep also triggers the Bedtime Guidance feature, but I didn't see any notifications. I asked Samsung why, and was told to turn it on in the Health app (Health > Sleep > tap three dots icon > Bedtime guidance). I still didn\u2019t get any guidance, which I realized was due to the fact that I have my bedtime set for 10PM, but I turn on the watch\u2019s sleep mode by 9PM most nights. What can I say, I like sleeping.\nA bigger battery makes the AOD A-OK\nOne of the prior model\u2019s shortcomings was battery life. The always-on display (AOD) tanked the charge, so I kept it off. The Galaxy Watch 8 has a bigger 325mAh battery, compared to the 300mAh one on the Watch 7. Twenty-five milliamp hours isn\u2019t a huge jump, but in batteries, bigger is always better. And that\u2019s true here.\nI charged the watch to full at 12:30PM, turned the AOD on and after two auto-detected bike rides, one walk, some Gemini requests, checking notifications and using a few timers, it was still at 75 percent at 8:45PM. I enabled sleep mode shortly after and slept until 6:15AM. Then I did an AI-coached three-mile run and it still had 27 percent at 9AM. At 2:30PM it hit seven percent and I put it on the charger. Samsung promises up to 30 hours of use on a charge with the AOD on. This was slightly less than that, but it was an activity-filled day and I was fine with the lifespan.\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is super swank\nThe spinning-bezel version of the latest watch is obviously aimed at the luxury watch-hound crowd. The knurled spinning bezel, inset diving bezel replica and the default chronograph watch face gives off serious Rolex Daytona/Omega Speedmaster wannabe vibes. It ships with a stitched leather-look band and the steel case has the heft and stature of an automatic mechanical timepiece. The always-on display and chunky buttons only add to the effect.\nFor me, the main advantage it has over the standard Galaxy Watch 8 is the protection the spinning bezel offers the raised display. The glass is shielded at the edges and it\u2019s even inset slightly, which should ward off scratches. At first I thought it would be too chunky, but it\u2019s surprisingly comfortable for its size and I really like how it looks. It\u2019s an extremely attractive watch. I mostly tested out the standard version of the Watch 8, because I think most people will opt for that model, but if I got one for myself, I think I\u2019d go with this beaut\nPricing and the competition\nSamsung added $50 to the price tag on the 40mm Galaxy Watch 8, bringing it to $350. The larger 44mm model is now $380 (versus $330 last year) and the Classic variant is $500 for the single 46mm size. For reference, there was no Galaxy Watch 7 Classic and the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic sold for $400 for the 43mm size and $430 for the 47mm.\nAt $350, the base model Galaxy Watch 8 costs the same as Google\u2019s Pixel Watch 3 (though the Pixel Watch 4 is almost certainly on the way and could be more expensive.) The Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399, but it went as low as $279 during Prime Day. And, of course, a new Apple wearable is likely coming this September with a potential price bump as well. So Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch 8 could end up being the most affordable of the major smartwatch releases once the dust settles from 2025\u2019s launches. And if you\u2019re a Samsung smartphone user, it\u2019s easily your best bet.\nAll the small things\nThe core functions of the Galaxy Watch 8 haven\u2019t changed all that much. We went in-depth on the fitness and health features for our review of the Galaxy Watch 6 and covered the notable perks of Samsung\u2019s wearable in our Galaxy Watch 7 review and our Galaxy Watch 5 review. So I\u2019ll just point out that the workout tracking is still accurate \u2014 and it\u2019s faster to suss out when I\u2019m on a walk than my Apple Watch. The companion Health app, where you view all the data your watch gathers, is helpful and a delight to use with its common-sense suggestions and friendly animations. And the daily Energy Score is a useful indicator of how I\u2019m doing with my sleep and movement goals.\nThe Watch 8 is an industrious accessory for a Galaxy phone. My only lingering gripe is that the notifications aren\u2019t as intrusive as my distracted brain needs them to be. They\u2019re easy for me to miss. The double tap feature is great \u2014 a pinch gesture that dismisses or triggers actions without you having to touch the screen. I use it often and the watch almost always registers the motion. The screen has only become more responsive and navigation is plenty zippy. And finally, I love how customizable the watch faces are.\nWrap-up: The best smartwatch Samsung has made in years\nThe substantially refreshed look was the first indicator that Samsung was (finally) doing something different with the Galaxy Watch. I was pleasantly surprised by how well and how quickly Gemini was able handle functions on the wearable itself, as well as answer my questions. The tiles make hunting down info on the watch much easier and the new health metrics like antioxidant levels and vascular load could come in handy for many folks. Also the Classic variant this year is a truly stunning timepiece, finally bringing a true grown-up style to smartwatches.\nThe AI running coach got more out of me than I thought possible (and ensured that I will be fast asleep before any Bedtime Guidance suggestions kick in). But the changes that pleased me the most were the improved battery and markedly increased comfort. Those were two factors that prevented the just-good Galaxy Watch 7 from being a great smartwatch. Of course, if you don\u2019t have a Samsung phone, there\u2019s no point in considering any Galaxy Watch (and if that\u2019s you, you probably haven\u2019t read this far down anyway). But if you\u2019re a Galaxy fan, this watch may very well delight you and help you get the most out of your phone."

      "text": "iOS 26 beta preview: Liquid Glass is better than you think\nApple\u2019s big design shift adjusts to fit reality.\nAt WWDC 2025, Apple revealed a major visual shake-up for iOS (not to mention the rest of the company\u2019s operating systems). This is the biggest change, aesthetically, since the shift away from the stitching, textures and skeuomorphic design of the iOS 4. It also comes with significantly fewer AI and Siri updates this time around. However, it\u2019s the smaller touches that make iOS 26 seem like a notable improvement over its predecessor.\nI\u2019ve been running the iOS 26 developer beta for the last two weeks and here's how Apple\u2019s new Liquid Glass design \u2014 and iOS 26 broadly \u2014 stacks up.\n(Ed. note: Apple just released the public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and watchOS 26. This means you can run the preview for yourself, if you are willing to risk potentially buggy or unstable software that could cause some of your apps to not work. As usual, we highly recommend backing up all your data before running any beta, and you can follow our guide on how to install Apple's public betas to do so.)\nLiquid Glass changes everything\niOS 26 looks new and modern. And for once, how Apple describes it \u2014 liquid glass \u2014 makes sense: it\u2019s a lot of layers of transparent elements overlapping and, in places, the animations are quite\u2026 liquidy. Menus and buttons will respond to your touch, with some of them coalescing around your finger and sometimes separating out into new menus.\nLiquid Glass encompasses the entire design of iOS. The home and lock screens have been redesigned once again, featuring a new skyscraping clock font that stretches out from the background of your photos, with ever-so-slight transparency. There\u2019s also a new 3D effect that infuses your photos with a bit of spatial magic, offering a touch of Vision Pro for iPhone users.\nThe experience in the first few builds of the iOS 26 beta was jarring and messy, especially with transparent icons and notifications, due to those overlapping elements making things almost illegible. Updates across subsequent releases have addressed this issue by making floating elements more opaque. There is also a toggle within the Accessibility tab in Settings to reduce transparency further, but I hope Apple offers a slider so that users can choose exactly how \u201cliquid\u201d they want their \u201cglass\u201d to be. If you own other Apple products, then you\u2019ll come to appreciate the design parity across your Mac, iPad and Apple Watch.\nOne noticeable change I'd been waiting for was the iOS search bar\u2019s relocation to the bottom of the screen. I first noticed it within Settings, but it reappears in Music, Podcasts, Photos and pretty much everywhere you might need to find specific files or menu items now. If, like me, you\u2019re an iPhone Pro or Plus user, you may have struggled to reach those search bars when they were at the top of the screen. It\u2019s a welcome improvement.\nVisual Intelligence\nWith iOS 26 on iPhones powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence, the company is bringing Visual Intelligence over to your screenshots. (Previously it was limited to Camera.) Once you\u2019ve grabbed a shot by pressing the power and volume up buttons, you\u2019ll get a preview of your image, surrounded by suggested actions that Apple Intelligence deduced would be relevant based on the contents of your screenshot.\nManaging Editor Cherlynn Low did a deep dive on what Visual Intelligence is capable of. From a screenshot, you can transfer information to other apps without having to switch or select them manually. This means I can easily screenshot tickets and emails, for example, to add to my calendar. Apple Intelligence can also identify types of plants, food and cars, even. If there are multiple people or objects in your screenshot, you can highlight what you want to focus on by circling it. There aren\u2019t many third-party app options at this point, but that\u2019s often the case with a beta build. These are features that Android users have had courtesy of Gemini for a year or two, but at least now we get something similar on iPhones.\nOne quick tip: Make sure to tap the markup button (the little pencil tip icon) to see Visual Intelligence in your screenshots. I initially thought my beta build was missing the feature, but it was just hidden behind the markup menu.\nMore broadly, Apple Intelligence continues to work well, but doesn't stand out in any particular way. We\u2019re still waiting for Siri to receive its promised upgrades. Still, iOS 26 appears to have improved the performance of many features that use the iPhone\u2019s onboard machine learning models. Since the first developer build, voice memos and voice notes are not only much faster, but also more accurate, especially with accents that the system previously struggled with.\nApple Intelligence\u2019s Writing tools \u2014 which I mainly use for summarizing meetings, conference calls and even lengthy PDFs \u2014 doesn't choke with more substantial reading. On iOS 18, it would struggle with voice notes longer than 10 minutes, trying to detangle or structure the contents of a meeting. I haven\u2019t had that issue with iOS 26 so far.\nGenmoji and Image Playground both offer up different results through the update. Image Playground can now generate pictures using ChatGPT. I\u2019ll be honest, I hadn\u2019t used the app since I tested it on iOS 18, but the upgrades mean it has more utility when I might want to generate AI artwork, which can occasionally reach photorealistic levels.\nOne useful addition is ChatGPT\u2019s \u201cany style\u201d option, meaning you can try to specify the style you have in mind, which can skirt a little closer to contentious mimicry \u2014 especially if you want, say, a frivolous image of you splashing in a puddle, Studio Ghibli style.\nApple also tweaked Genmoji to add deeper customization options, but these AI-generated avatars don\u2019t look like me? I liked the original Genmoji that launched last year, which had the almost-nostalgic style of 2010 emoji, but still somehow channeled the auras of me, my friends and family. This new batch are more detailed and elaborate, sure, but they don\u2019t look right. Also, they make me look bald. And contrary to my detractors, I am not bald. Yet. This feels like a direct attack, Apple.\nYou might feel differently, however. For example, Cherlynn said that the first version of Genmoji did not resemble her, frequently presenting her as someone with much darker skin or of a different ethnicity, regardless of the source picture she submitted.\nStill, the ability to change a Genmoji\u2019s expression, as well as add and remove glasses and facial hair through the new appearance customization options, is an improvement.\nA Camera app redesign for everyone\nApple has revisited the camera app, returning to basics by stripping away most of the previously offered modes and settings \u2014 at least initially \u2014 to display only video and photo modes.\nYou can swipe up from the bottom to see additional options, like flash, the timer, exposure, styles and more. You can also tap on the new six-dot icon in the upper right of the interface for the same options, though that requires a bit more of a reach. These behave in line with the new Liquid Glass design and you\u2019ll see the Photo pill expand into the settings menu when you press either area. Long-pressing on icons lets you go deeper into shooting modes, adjusting frame rates and even recording resolutions.\nWhat I like here is that it benefits casual smartphone photographers while keeping all the settings that more advanced users demand. None of the updates here are earth-shattering, though. I hope Apple takes a good look at what Adobe\u2019s Project Indigo camera app is doing \u2014 there are a lot of good ideas there.\nOne extra improvement if you use AirPods: Pressing and holding the stem of your AirPod (if it has an H2 chip) can now start video recording.\nApple Music tries to DJ\nAlongside the Liquid Glass design touches, the big addition to Apple Music this year is AutoMix. Like a (much) more advanced version of the crossfade feature found on most music streaming apps, in iOS 26, Music tries to mix between tracks, slowing or speeding up tempos, gently fading in drums or bass loops before the next song kicks in. Twenty percent of the time, it doesn\u2019t work well \u2014 or Apple Music doesn\u2019t even try. But the new ability to pin playlists and albums is useful, especially for recommendations from other folks that you never got around to listening to.\nMessages get a little more fun\nApple is making Messages more fun. One of the ways it\u2019s doing so is by enabling custom backgrounds in chats, much like in WhatsApp. I immediately set out to find the most embarrassing photo of my colleague (and frenemy) Cherlynn Low and make it our chat background. I know she\u2019s also running iOS 26 in beta, so she will see it. [Ed. note: Way to give me a reason to ignore your messages, Mat!]\nApple\u2019s Live translation now works across Messages, voice calls and FaceTime. Setting things up can be a little complicated \u2014 you\u2019ll first need to download various language files to use the feature. There\u2019s also some inconsistency in the languages supported across the board. For instance, Mandarin and Japanese are supported in Messages, but not on FaceTime yet. In chats, if your system language is set to English or Spanish, then you\u2019ll only be able to translate into English or Spanish. For those polyglots out there, if you want to translate incoming Japanese texts into German, you\u2019ll need to set your device's language to German.\nWhile I didn\u2019t get to flex my Japanese abilities on voice calls and FaceTime, iOS 26 was more than capable of keeping up with some rudimentary German and Spanish. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d rely on it for serious business translation or holiday bookings, but I think it could be a very useful tool for basics.\nThere\u2019s also the ability to filter spam messages to their own little folder (purgatory). Spam texts remain a nightmare, so I appreciate any potential weapons in the fight. Sadly, it hasn\u2019t quite manage to deal with the TikTok marketing agencies and phone network customer services that continue to barrage my Messages. Still, hopefully Apple will continue to improve its detection algorithms.\nOne more tool in the battle against spam: You can mute notifications for Messages from unknown numbers, although time-sensitive alerts from delivery services and rideshare apps will still reach you.\nNew apps are hit-or-miss\nNot everything in the beta lands, however. I\u2019ve already touched on how Liquid Glass was initially a semi-transparent mess. The Games App, too, seems like an unnecessary addition. Because it\u2019s a blend of the Games tab of the App Store and a silo of your preinstalled games, I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s adding. It\u2019s not any easier to navigate, nor does it introduce me to games I want to buy.\nCherlynn did want to highlight that for a casual gamer like herself, it\u2019s intriguing to see if the Games app might start to recommend more mind-numbing puzzles or farming simulations. She was also intrigued by the idea of a more social gaming experience on iOS, issuing challenges to her friends. Still, because the phone she has been testing the beta on doesn\u2019t have access to all her contacts or her gaming history, the recommendations and features are fairly limited at the moment.\nGames is one of two new apps that will automatically join your home screen. (Fortunately, they can be uninstalled). The other is Preview, which should be a familiar addition to any Mac user. It offers an easy way to view sent or downloaded files, like menus, ticket QR codes and more. During the developer beta, the app pulled in a handful of my documents that previously lived in the Files app. Navigation across both those apps is identical, although Preview is limited to files you can actually open, of course.\nAirPods, upgraded\nThis is more iPhone-adjacent, but iOS 26 includes several quality-of-life improvements for some of Apple\u2019s headphones. First up: notifications when your AirPods are fully charged, finally! The Apple Watch got this kind of notification back in iOS 14, so it\u2019s great to see Apple\u2019s headphones catch up.\nApple is also promising \u201cstudio-quality sound recording\u201d from the AirPods, augmenting recordings with computational audio improvements. There\u2019s a noticable bump in audio quality. It appears that AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 will record files at a sample rate of 48 kHz, which is double the rate used in the past. The sample rate bump happened last year, but it is dependent on what the app you're using. Is it \u201cstudio quality\u201d? I don\u2019t think so, but it\u2019s an improvement. While recordings sound slightly better in quiet locations, the bigger change is in loud environments. The algorithm doesn't appear to be degrading audio quality as much while trying to reduce background noise.\niOS 26 also adds sleep detection to the buds. If the AirPods detect minimal movement, they\u2019ll switch off automatically, which could be helpful for the next time I\u2019m flying long-haul.\nWrap-up\nIn iOS 26, Apple has prioritized design changes and systemwide consistency over AI-centric software and features. While Liquid Glass is a big change to how your iPhone looks, Apple has drawn from user feedback to finesse the design into feeling less jarring and gelling better when the home screen, Control Center and Notification drop-downs overlap with each other.\nThere are numerous quality of life improvements, including Messages and Visual Intelligence, in particular. If anything, the AI elephant in the room is the lack of any substantial updates on Siri. After the company talked up advanced Siri interactions over a year ago, I\u2019m still waiting for its assistant to catch up with the likes of Google."
