  "content": "Grinning for the camera holding a sign supporting her beloved American football team, the woman hardly looks like an assassin, let alone one operating in the UK.\n\nYet Aimee Betro, 45, was found guilty on Tuesday of travelling 4,000 miles from her Wisconsin home to carry out a \u2018hit\u2019 on a man in Birmingham.\n\nExtraordinarily, the na\u00efve American received no payment for the shooting despite apparently struggling for money.\n\nHer motive? She was prepared to kill for love after becoming infatuated with a British petty criminal she met via a dating app.\n\nBetro wore a niqab to disguise her appearance before pointing the gun at her victim\u2019s head and pulling the trigger.\n\nThe pistol jammed and target Sikander Ali, 33, managed to flee but Betro wasn\u2019t finished: she returned hours later to fire three shots through the windows of Mr Ali\u2019s home. Police said it was only by chance no one was killed.\n\nIn the aftermath of the botched hit in September 2019, Betro returned home to the US before fleeing to Armenia where she remained on the run until the Daily Mail tracked her down in June last year and tipped off police about her whereabouts, leading to her arrest and return to the UK for trial.\n\nShe denied all charges, telling her trial it was a \u2018terrible coincidence\u2019 she was around the corner six minutes after the shooting and it must have been another \u2018fat American woman\u2019 who brought the Mercedes used in the shooting.\n\nIndeed, wearing a summer dress and flip-flops, Betro looked more like a relaxed tourist heading for the beach than a determined assassin in CCTV from after the shooting.\n\nBut jurors at Birmingham Crown Court on Tuesday found her guilty of conspiracy to murder, meaning the full astonishing story of how she became caught up in a feud between two rival Asian families in the Midlands can now be told in full for the first time.\n\nBetro, who wore her mousy brown hair in two \u2018space\u2019 buns on top of her head throughout her two-week trial, showed no emotion as the verdicts were delivered.\n\nFriends, however, could not explain how she became caught up in the bizarre murder plot.\n\nOne told the Daily Mail she was the \u2018last person\u2019 they\u2019d pick to kill someone, although another friend, who knew her from the electronic music scene, hinted at motivation when he said: \u2018She\u2019s either got brainwashed in some romance thing or she\u2019s been framed... it would be completely out of character.\u2019Betro was born in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, and her mother Jeanne Johnson, 64, and father Steven Betro, a convicted methamphetamine dealer, separated when she was young. She attended Stevens Point Area Senior High School, graduating in 1996, and played competitive disc golf, also known as frisbee golf.\n\nShe went on to study early childhood education at Mid-State Technical College in Wisconsin, graduating in 2005. A series of low paid jobs followed. She then worked as an administrator for her beloved Milwaukee Brewers Major League Baseball team, selling tickets.\n\nA relatively normal existence, then, until September 2018, when she met a man on a dating app who went by the name of \u2018Dr Ice\u2019. That man was Nabil Mohammed Nazir, now 31, from Derby.\n\nBetro was apparently smitten and soon began planning a solo two-week trip to the UK. She arrived in London on Christmas Day 2018, staying in an Airbnb in King\u2019s Cross, and other hotels across the capital - although it is unclear how she funded the visit.\n\nQuizzed by her barrister Paul Lewis KC, she described how she did typical \u2018tourist stuff\u2019 - but also met Nazir, 13 years her junior, for the first time when he visited her at the Airbnb, where they spent the night together.\n\nIt was the only time they ever slept together but it seems this encounter was all it took for Betro to turn would-be hitwoman a year later.\n\nFor Nazir, a petty drug dealer and \u2018businessman\u2019 was also a \u2018cunning and calculated criminal\u2019 who was involved in a bitter feud with another Asian family, sparked by a row in a Birmingham bridal boutique.\n\nThe fight in July 2018, over the price of a suit Nazir and his family believed was in the sale, left his father taxi driver Mohammed Aslam, 57, seriously injured.\n\nNazir was \u2018hell bent\u2019 on revenge for the injuries his father sustained in the bloody brawl at the Seher wedding shop, owned by Mahumad Aslat, and set about plotting to kill him or members of his family.\n\nHe somehow convinced Betro to take part - and so in August 2019 she flew to the UK again, arriving at Manchester airport from Atlanta before taking a train to Birmingham Airport, where she hired a car - apparently at Nazir\u2019s request - and set off to see him in Derby.\n\nWhen she arrived, he took over driving the car and within minutes was in a collision with two vehicles - one being driven by his father and another by a woman he knew, both of whom later received insurance payouts.\n\nThe court heard that far from being an unfortunate coincidence it was part of an insurance scam orchestrated by Nazir and involving Betro. The court heard Nazir fled the scene while Betro was on the phone to the AA, telling them she was the driver.\n\nIt is not known if the other two were aware of the scam but prosecutor Tom Walkling said Betro was well aware and the plot was evidence she was in love with Nazir and \u2018happy to break the law if that is what he wanted\u2019.\n\nQuestioning Betro, Mr Walkling said: \u2018Do you think with hindsight that Nazir was taking advantage of you?\u2019 She replied simply: \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019After the crash, she checked into a hotel in Derby hoping to spend the following day - her birthday - with Nazir, but he said he was too busy and so she spent the day wandering the Midlands city alone.\n\nMr Walkling said: \u2018Are we right in thinking you had gone to Derby for your birthday just to see Mr Nazir because you loved him?\u2019 She replied: \u2018Yes\u2019.\n\nMr Walkling went on: \u2018Were you still in love with Mr Nazir given how he had treated you [after the crash]?\u2019 Betro answered: \u2018I still cared for him, yes.\u2019Just days later, she checked into the Rotunda hotel in Birmingham using a fake name and tried to lure shop owner Mr Aslat out on the pretence of buying a car he was selling.\n\nWhen that failed, she bought a second-hand Mercedes and travelled to Measham Grove, in the Yardley area of Birmingham, where Mr Aslat lived with his family, including his son Sikander Ali.\n\nCCTV footage captured the moment Betro pulled up outside the home, where moments later Mr Ali arrived in a black SUV. Betro got out of the car and approached him gun drawn. She fired but the weapon jammed and Mr Ali jumped back into his car and reversed away at speed.\n\nMr Walkling KC, prosecuting said the \u2018would-be assassin\u2019 tried to disguise her appearance by wearing a niqab - a long garment worn by some Muslim women that covers the face - or \u2018what looked like a burka\u2019 - a similar garment that covers the body and face but has a mesh covering the eyes as well.\n\nHe told jurors she was \u2018not deterred\u2019 and \u2018returned to the same address on the same cul-de-sac a few hours later, using the now working gun to shoot three bullets through the bedroom windows of the victim\u2019s home\u2019.\n\nBetro flew back to the US the following day from Manchester Airport. Nazir flew out to join her three days later.\n\nWhile in the US they travelled around visiting various places including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle as well as a theme park and the notorious US military base at Area 51 in Nevada.\n\nBetro told jurors she did not even know there had been a shooting in Measham Grove and Nazir had not mentioned it during his time in the States, which ended in mid-October when he flew with Norwegian Air back to Gatwick and was arrested.\n\nHe and his father were jailed last year. Nazir was sentenced to 32 years for conspiracy to murder while Mohammed Aslam, 57, was told he would serve 10 years.\n\nBut Betro managed to evade authorities for five years - despite an international warrant for her arrest - until she was tracked down to a bolthole in Armenia thanks to investigations by the Daily Mail.\n\nThe Mail told West Midlands Police about her location and agreed to a news blackout until she was arrested to avoid her fleeing again before she could be extradited back to the UK for trial.\n\nGiving evidence in her defence during the trial, she had claimed it was \u2018another American woman\u2019 who booked taxis in the aftermath of the shooting and she was not involved.\n\nBut jurors were told her DNA was found on a black glove in the Mercedes used in the shooting, while a description of a \u2018short fat American woman\u2019 given by the man selling the vehicle \u2018could not have been anyone else\u2019.\n\nThe gun used in the shooting was a rare American Hi-Point C-9 pistol - which has not been seen by experts in this country either before or after the attempted murder. Police still do not know how she got the gun - it was never recovered and was only identified by experts in ballistics.\n\nThe prosecution raised the possibility the gun was somehow smuggled in from the US, but did not know how. Betro was known to have posted gun parts through the post on a separate occasion.\n\nBecause she was extradited under a \u2018red notice\u2019 - a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and arrest a person - she was immediately charged and remanded in custody, rather than being first arrested and interviewed, so she was never questioned by police.\n\nMeanwhile Nazir gave only \u2018no comment\u2019 answers during his police interview.\n\nThe pair also communicated largely by Snapchat - where messages disappear after sending - which means what they discussed may never be known.\n\nBut the court heard Nazir and his father\u2019s bank records were examined and there was no record of any payments to Betro. In fact she even paid for his return ticket to the US after the botched hit.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Alastair Orencas, from West Midlands Police\u2019s major crime unit, said her motivation was that she was \u2018in love or infatuated with him\u2019. He said it was only through luck or incompetence that Mr Ali was not dead.\n\n\u2018It would have been a point-blank discharge of a self-loading pistol,\u2019 he said. \u2018I have no doubt whatsoever that if that gun had discharged at that point he would have died. It strikes me that it was a well-planned, persistent murderous attempt to take someone\u2019s life.\u2019\n\nBut he said Betro\u2019s use of a niqab to hide her face \u2018didn\u2019t work very well\u2019 as \u2018the footwear didn\u2019t change, phones didn\u2019t change\u2019 and various CCTV cameras caught her in the area of the shooting.\n\nAnd such was her infatuation, Betro continued to help Nazir even after the failed murder plot, posting ammunition and gun parts to another of his rivals, former business partner, company director Faris Quayum, in a bid to frame him.\n\nShe was also found guilty of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, and a charge related to posting the gun parts and the ammunition into the UK from a US post office.\n\nHis Honour Judge Simon Drew KC told Betro she would be sentenced next Thursday, adding: \u2018I suspect Miss Betro would like to know the outcome of this case and there is nothing worse than sitting waiting.\u2019\n\nDuring her trial, she had to endure a four-hour round trip from women-only HMP New Hall near Wakefield in West Yorkshire, the closest facility to Birmingham that caters for \u2018Category A\u2019 women such as her and where Rose West is locked up.\n\nHer mother, who had urged Betro to hand herself in when on the run, said simply that \u2018I\u2019m not interested\u2019 when contacted this week.\n\nShe too must be left wondering how her sport-loving daughter, who was \u2018no trouble as a child\u2019, has found herself behind bars with some of the country\u2019s most dangerous criminals.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not the happy love story ending Betro must have hoped for.",

      "text": "'Hitwoman' disguised in burka accused of attempting to gun down store owner\nAn American hitwoman dressed in a niqab and a burka tried to shoot dead a businessman outside his home in Birmingham, UK, as part of a 'deadly' feud involving two families, a court heard.\nVideo footage shown to jurors allegedly shows Aimee Betro, 45, pointing a firearm at her intended victim as he arrives home in a car but her gun jams and he manages to speed away.\nHours later Betro returned to the victim's home and fired three shots through the window, Birmingham Crown Court was told.\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\nBrilliant disguise: American woman Aimee Betro was allegedly hired to kill a businessman in the UK as part of a violent family feud; pictured wearing a burka before the attempted murder\nBetro, originally from Wisconsin, appeared in the dock Monday.\nShe denies three charges of conspiracy to murder, possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, and a charge related to the alleged importation of ammunition into the UK.\nOpening the case, Tom Walkling KC, prosecuting told jurors that Betro had been involved in a conspiracy with two other men as part of their vendetta against businessman Aslat Mahumad.\nWalkling said 'revenge was the motive' after Mohammed Nazir, 30, and Mohammed Aslam, 56, were injured during a clash at Muhamad's clothing store in July 2018.\n'On the seventh of September 2019 in a suburban cul-de-sac in South Yardley a would-be assassin tried to shoot a man called Sikander Ali at close range outside his house.\n'The assassin was a woman who tried to disguise her appearance by wearing a niqab - a face covering - and what looked like a burka.'\nHe told jurors the gun jammed but she was 'not deterred' and 'returned to the same address on the same street a few hours later and used the now-working gun to shoot three bullets through the bedroom windows of the victim's home.'\nAttempted hit: Footage shows the burka-clad woman pointing a gun at the driver of a black car\nThe court was told her two co-onspirators Nazir and his father Aslam, from Derby, had already been tried and convicted over the plot.\nBoth have been convicted of conspiracy to murder while Nazir was also convicted of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.\nWalkling said Betro was in contact with Nazir before she flew to Manchester Airport in August 2019.\nHe said Betro had two phones - a normal 'day to day' cell which she used regularly - and a 'dirty phone' - bought before the shooting.\nWalkling said the motive for the murder was 'revenge'.\nCasual garb: Betro arrived at a Birmingham hotel wearing a dress, hoodie and flip flops\nCharges: She denies conspiracy to murder, possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, and a charge related to the alleged importation of ammunition into the UK\nHe said Nazir and Aslam were involved in a 'vendetta' with a family in Birmingham, specifically clothes shop owner called Mahumad, whose son was Sikander Ali.\nBoth men lived at an address in Measham Grove, South Yardley where Betro allegedly tried to murder Ali and where she fired bullets through the window.\nThe court heard that in July 2018 there was a disorder at Mahumad's shop which resulted in damage to the premises and Nazir, Aslam, and Aslat Mahumad all getting injured.\nJurors were told that in August Betro went to Birmingham and hired a Mercedes C Class car from Enterprise at Birmingham Airport.\nShe then stayed at a hotel in Derby for two nights before traveling to London and Brighton before returning to Birmingham and then back to Derby.\nTrial run? A video clip found on Nazir's phone shows a gun being 'tested' and also jamming - like the one Betro allegedly used later\nThe court was played a video clip - from Nazir's phone - showing a gun being fired into the ground three days before the attempted shooting in Birmingham which prosecutors said was a bid to 'test' the weapon.\nWalkling said: 'It's a firearm that fires the same caliber of ammunition that police recovered from outside the victim's home a few days after this video was made.'\nThe 'metadata' for the clip shows it was created on September 4, 2019, the day Betro was in Derby and three minutes before Nazir added Betro's snapchat details into his phone.\nWalkling said to jurors: 'You have to ask yourself was Betro there with Nazir testing this gun?\nJailed: Mohammed Aslam has been found guilty of hiring a female assassin to carry out a gun attack on a rival family\nAccomplice son: Mohammed Nabil Nazir has also been jailed for hiring a hitwoman\nOther surveillance footage from Rotunda hotel in Birmingham shows Betro in a summer dress, hoodie, rucksack and flip flops.\nWhile at the hotel on September 6 she phoned Mahumad, claiming she wanted to buy the car he was selling online.\nWalkling said: 'Mr Mahumad recalls being called by a woman with an American accent... He was confused, as he hadn't listed his number online.\n'The woman said she wanted to buy the car today, but Mr Mahumad said she could see it tomorrow.\n'As I'm sure you have guessed, ladies and gentlemen, we say the woman with the American accent was this defendant, Aimee Betro, and that she was calling Mr Mahumad as a pretext to set up a chance to kill him. And who else could it be? she had the phone she bought it only hours before.'\nBurner cell: Betro at a Tesco store where she bought a mobile phone and SIM card\nLater that night she met up with Nazir, who went with her to her hotel room where they ordered food before he traveled back to Derby with his father in their transit van.\nThe following day she tried to kill Aslat Mahumad's son, jurors were told.\nThe court heard she left the hotel and bought another cheap mobile phone and SIM card - all caught on CCTV.\nAfter buying a Mercedes using a false name, she called Mahumad once again on the pretext of looking at a car. Mahumad said he couldn't meet, and that she could meet someone else with the car the next day.\nLater that day she met with Nazir and Aslam with phone data showing her dirty phone connected to Nazir's wireless network.\nThe Mercedes was later seen at the entrance to Measham Grove. Mr Walking said the driver 'appears to be wearing a face-covering, a niqab'.\nHe said at 7.22pm hours, Betro drove onto Measham Grove and waited for her target.\nAt 9.10pm Sikander Ali pulled onto Measham Grove in his black SUV which was all caught on camera.\nIn video footage played to the court, a woman which the prosecution said was Betro, can be seen approaching the SUV and firing but the gun jams.\nShe later dumped the Mercedes. Police found a black glove with Betro's DNA inside.\n'Further proof if any was needed ... that she was the gunwoman in the burka',' Mr Walkling said.\nSix minutes later she was again caught on CCTV shown to the jury from close to where the car was dumped wearing a summer dress, hoodie and flip flops and carrying two bags.\nCandid selfie: Betro flew back to the U.S. one day after the chilling attempted murder\nBetro then sent text messages to her intended target, the court was told. Screenshots of the texts were shown to the jury.\nShe said to him: 'Where are you hiding? followed by 'Stop playing hide and seek you are lucky it jammed'.\nBetro then called another taxi to take her back to Measham Grove.\nJurors were show CCTV of a figure matching Betro's description firing three shots in to the family home.\n'Ladies and gentlemen the gun didn't jam that time did it?' Mr Walkling said.\n'Did you note, the hoodie, and the handbag worn across her body, just as Betro was dressed earlier.\n'Three shots were fired. Three bullets went through the windows of Aslat Muhamad's family home. Three bullet casings were found in the street outside.'\nWalkling said Betro then got back into the taxi and during the journey she sent a text message to Mahumad which said: 'You wanna rip me off you wanna be a drug king go look at your house watch your back i'll be shedding blood'.\nShe flew back to the U.S. the following day from Manchester Airport.\nNazir flew out to join her three days later.
