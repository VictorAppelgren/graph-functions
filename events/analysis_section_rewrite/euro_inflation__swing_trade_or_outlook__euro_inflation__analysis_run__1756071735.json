      "feedback": "Strong regime-based framing and credible anchor points, but the draft undercuts world-class quality on format discipline, explicit traded-asset detail, and tightly scoped trigger/invalidation logic. Immediate edits: (1) Convert the four Swing Trade lines into the strict 9-field schema required (Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100) and keep horizons plausible for swing timing (prefer 6–12 weeks for the AI/regime A line and 3–6 months for the oil line; 0–3 weeks for the German/PMI lines). Do not mix 12–24 month horizons into Swing Trade lines unless you explicitly treat them as longer-term bets; or split into a near-term swing and a separate longer Outlook. (2) Ground probabilities to the material’s evidence (e.g., A ≈ 50%, B ≈ 30%, C ≈ 20% from NL5YYTLF2) and attach the relevant IDs next to the numbers; fix any mismatched numbers (e.g., 52% in the Outlook) to a consistent basis. (3) Tie each line to a concrete tradable vehicle: for AI/regime A, cite an ETF or index proxy (e.g., AI-related equity exposure) and for oil, cite Brent/WTI ranges from NL5YYTLF2/T1QE6JPIX; for the German PMIs, cite 52EQBV548; ensure all numerical anchors have a source tag. (4) Sharpen the causal chain: explicitly map how regime drivers transmit to asset prices (e.g., AI adoption lifts expected cash flows in tech/AI-cap equities; policy-driven discount-rate changes affect all risk assets; labor/agrifood shocks lift input costs and press margins in consumer/industrial names). (5) Remove or segregate nonessential material (the Bose/Headphones block) to avoid dilution of focus; if unrelated topics appear, move them to a separate section or omit. (6) For the Outlook line, format as 1 line and preserve the required fields, but ensure it remains clearly distinct from Swing Trade content and uses the same disciplined probability basis (e.g., 50–60% base tilt to Regime A, with explicit invalidation triggers). (7) Reconcile conflicts by presenting a concise cross-regime verdict: state which regimes would price which assets under which triggers, and show how oil vs. AI pacing could diverge, with a single, explicit invalidation rule (e.g., PMI under 50 consistently or AI deployment fails for 3–5 quarters). (8) Tighten phrasing for world-class clarity: replace vague terms with precise metrics (e.g., “Brent mid-60s; WTI low-60s” with exact bands, e.g., Brent 60–66, WTI 58–63, only when supported by the cited sources). (9) Ensure coverage of all critical sources: align references so that the four lines reflect the core anchors (R3WNA7L7A, URA82RR2I, NL5YYTLF2, 52EQBV548, T1QE6JPIX, J99EM2TPZ) and avoid introducing new IDs unless asserted in the MATERIAL. (10) Finally, deliver the Swing Trade content in two lines maximum if you need two pivots; ensure each line is self-contained with a crisp trigger and a quantifiable risk/reward. Implementing these edits will raise the piece to world-class standards: precise, citation-backed, and clearly actionable across 2 Up and 2 Down swing lines plus a succinct Outlook.",
