  "title": "The newbie's guide to getting the most out of AI",
  "description": "AI is everywhere and it's easy to feel like you're left behind. If you\u2019re still a novice, there are a few things you can do to get started.",
  "content": "At the University of Texas, where I\u2019m senior vice provost of academic affairs, our credo (coined by the head of our Office of Academic Technology, Julie Schell) is to be AI Forward and AI Responsible. In service of this, over the past few years, we launched a homegrown AI tutoring platform (UT Sage), launched a second platform to enable faculty, staff, and students to engage with building AI tools (UT Spark), provided a license for Copilot for everyone at UT, and engaged a working group called Good Systems focused on the ethical implications of AI models.\n\nAlthough all of the conversation about AI makes it seem like it\u2019s taken over the world, it hasn\u2019t. Although it appears to be growing in popularity, there\u2019s no shame in having waited to see how the tech matures and the hype shakes out. But if you\u2019re ready to dip your toe into the AI waters, here\u2019s my advice. In this piece you\u2019ll learn:\n\u2022 The first thing you should ask AI to do for you\n\u2022 How to get AI to perfect your tone when communicating with clients\n\u2022 Why you actually need to read the terms of service before you start\n\nThe early-rate deadline for Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies Awards is Friday, September 5, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply today.",
