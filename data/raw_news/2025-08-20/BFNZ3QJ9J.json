      "text": "US inflation held steady as mild tariff hit offset by cheaper gas, food\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. inflation was unchanged in July as rising prices for some imported goods were balanced by falling gas and grocery prices, leaving overall prices modestly higher than a year ago.\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday, the same as the previous month and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June. Both figures are above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.\nThe new numbers suggest that slowing rent increases and cheaper gas are offsetting some impacts of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. Many businesses are also likely still absorbing much of the cost of the duties. Tuesday\u2019s figures probably reflect some impact from the 10% universal tariff Trump imposed in April, as well as higher duties on countries such as China and Canada.\nBrian Bethune, an economist at Boston College, said that overall U.S. tariffs \u2014 calculated as the amount of duties paid by U.S. companies divided by overall imports \u2014 has reached 10%, the highest in decades, and will likely keep rising for months.\n\u201cThose cost increases will be passed on to the consumer in some way, shape, or form,\u201d Bethune said. Some companies could return to \u201cshrinkflation,\u201d he added, in which they reduce the package size of a good while keeping the price the same.\nAnd companies that are absorbing tariff costs, which would cut into their profit margins, are less likely to hire new employees, he said.\nThe Federal Reserve may now be in a difficult spot.\nHiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced tariffs in April. The stalling out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank at its next meeting in September, and some Fed officials have raised concerns about the health of the job market. A rate cut by the Fed often, but not always, lowers borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business loans.\nEconomists are divided over how Fed officials will read the data in the coming months. Some argued that the worsening jobs picture will outweigh lingering inflation concerns and lead the Fed to cut at its next meeting in September. Yet some say that with core inflation notably above 2% and rising, the Fed will postpone that decision.\nChair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines \u2014 a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs.\nOn Tuesday, Trump attacked Powell again for not cutting rates and suggested he would allow a lawsuit against the Fed to proceed because of the rising costs of its extensive building renovation. It wasn\u2019t clear what lawsuit he was referring to.\nOn a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices ticked up 0.3%, a bit faster than the 0.2% in June.\nGas prices fell 2.2% from June to July and have plunged 9.5% from a year earlier, the government\u2019s report said. Grocery prices slipped 0.1% last month, though they are still 2.2% higher than a year ago.\nTariffs appeared to raise the cost of some imported items: Shoe prices jumped 1.4% from June to July, though they are still just 0.9% more expensive than a year ago. The cost of furniture leapt 0.9% in July and is 3.2% higher than a year earlier.\nCoffee costs nearly 15% more than a year earlier, mostly because of troubled harvests overseas, though steep duties on imports from Brazil could push those prices higher in the coming months. Nearly all U.S. coffee is imported.\nTuesday\u2019s data arrives at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported.\nThe president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer.\nAdding to the turmoil at BLS is a government hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did earlier this year. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable.\nSmaller companies are trying to avoid raising prices and some have turned to novel ways of raising funds.\nClothing maker Princess Awesome, which designs matching clothes for children and adults, has seen its costs jump 15% to 20% because of the tariffs. The company has joined a lawsuit seeking to block the duties. Rebecca Melsky, CEO and co-founder of the firm, says it is prohibitively expensive to make the cotton blend fabrics it uses in the United States.\nFor now, the company has instituted a \u201ctip jar\u201d on its website where it asks customers to help defray the cost of goods.\n\u201cWe have not across the board raised prices because of the tariffs -- yet,\u201d she said.\nTrump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven\u2019t fallen much since the levies were put in place.\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Yet the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear two-thirds of the burden, while foreign exporters pay a quarter and U.S. companies handle less than a tenth.\nMany large corporations are raising prices, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker. Most of those increases weren\u2019t in place for Tuesday\u2019s inflation report.\nConsumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices in August on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages. Walmart has also raised prices.\nAnd cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history.\n____\nAssociated Press Retail Writer Anne D\u2019Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report."

      "text": "Why Trump\u2019s call for the Fed to cut interest rates may not help consumers\nWhy Trump\u2019s call for the Fed to cut interest rates may not help consumers\nPresident Donald Trump is badgering the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but even if the Fed gave in to the pressure, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily lead to lower borrowing costs for consumers.\nIn fact, economists say, Trump\u2019s ongoing attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his tariff policies could keep the longer-term interest rates that matter for consumers and businesses higher than they otherwise would be. A less-independent Fed can lead, over time, to higher borrowing costs, as investors worry that inflation may spike in the future. As a result they demand higher yields to own Treasury securities.\nTrump has repeatedly urged Powell to cut the short-term interest rate that the central bank controls. The Fed typically reduces its rate during an economic downturn to encourage more borrowing and spending, and raises it to cool the economy and fight inflation when prices rise.\nBut long-term rates on things like mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards are largely set by market forces. And in recent weeks, fears that Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs could raise inflation, along with the administration\u2019s threats to the Fed\u2019s independence, have led markets to push those longer term rates higher. It\u2019s not clear that the Fed can fully reverse those trends by itself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not automatically true that even if the Fed were to cut rates, that you would see a measured decline in long-term interest rates,\u201d Francesco Bianchi, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said. \u201cThis kind of pressure on the Fed might backfire...if markets don\u2019t believe the Fed has inflation under control.\u201d\nTrump renewed calls on Wednesday and Thursday for Powell to reduce the Fed\u2019s short-term rate, telling reporters that the chair is \u201cmaking a mistake\u201d by not doing so.\nAnd last week, Trump suggested he could fire Powell, while a top aide said that the White House was \u201cstudying\u201d whether it could do so.\nStock markets plunged in response, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose, and the dollar fell, an unusual combination that suggested investors were selling most American assets. Markets recovered those losses after Trump said on Tuesday that he had \u201cno intention\u201d of firing the Fed chair.\nStill, the threats to the Fed\u2019s independence unnerved Wall Street investors, because they see a Fed free from political pressure as critical to keeping inflation in check. An independent Fed can take unpopular steps, such as raising rates, to fight inflation.\n\u201cThreatening the Fed doesn\u2019t soothe markets \u2014 it spooks them,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, chief market strategist at New York Life Investments. \u201cAnd the result is often the opposite of what any administration wants to see: higher rates, weaker confidence, and more market turmoil.\u201d\nSince Trump began imposing tariffs in early March, when he slapped duties on Canada and Mexico, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen from 4.15% to about 4.3%. The yield is a benchmark for mortgage rates and other borrowing. Mortgage rates, in turn, have increased during that time, from 6.6% to 6.8%.\nWhile Trump says he is negotiating over tariffs with many countries, most economists expect some level of duties to remain in place for at least this year, including his 10% duties on nearly all imports.\nThe 10-year yield did fall Thursday when two Federal Reserve officials said that rate cuts are possible as soon as this summer, should the economy falter and unemployment rise.\nYet last fall, longer-term interest rates also fell in anticipation of rate cuts, but then rose once the Fed cut in September and then continued to rise as the central bank reduced its rate again in November \u2014 two days after the election \u2014 and in December. Mortgage rates are now higher than they were when the Fed cut.\nA range of factors can affect longer-term Treasury rates, including expectations for future growth and inflation, as well as the supply and demand for government bonds. Bianchi worries that stubbornly high government budget deficits \u2014 which are financed by trillions of dollars of Treasurys \u2014 could also lift long-term rates.\nShould the Fed cut rates now, llonger-term borrowing costs \u201cwould move in the opposite direction, absolutely,\u201d Goodwin said, \u201cbecause the threat of inflation is so palpable -- that move would call their credibility into question.\u201d\nTrump said in a social media post this week that there is \u201cvirtually No Inflation\u201d and as a result, the Fed should lower its key rate, from its current level of about 4.3%. Many economists expect the central bank will do so this year. But Powell has underscored that the central bank wants to evaluate the impact of Trump\u2019s policies before making any moves.\nInflation has fallen in recent months, dropping to 2.4% in March, the lowest level since last September. Yet excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core inflation was 2.8%. Core prices often provide a better signal of where inflation is headed.\nA key issue for the Fed is that the economy is very different now than it was during Trump\u2019s first term. Back then inflation was actually below the Fed\u2019s target. At that time, it was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to cut rates, Bianchi said, if there was a threat of a recession, because inflation wasn\u2019t an issue.\nBut now, tariffs will almost certainly lift prices in the coming months, at least temporarily. That raises the bar much higher for a Fed rate cut, Bianchi said.\nStill, once there are clear signs the economy is deteriorating, such as a rising unemployment rate, the Fed will cut rates, regardless of what Trump does, economists said.\nTrump on Monday accused Powell of often being \u201ctoo late\u201d with his rate decisions, but ironically the Fed may move more slowly this time because of the threat of higher prices from tariffs. Without clear evidence of a downturn, Fed officials would worry about being seen as giving in to political pressure from Trump if they cut.\n\u201cPowell knows the irreparable damage that would occur if it was perceived that he cut because he was forced to by Trump,\u201d said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income.\nThe Fed now \u201cwill be even more delayed because I think you\u2019re going get more of an inflation lift initially, before you get the more pronounced slowing in growth,\u201d Porcelli said.\nEither way it may take more than a Fed cut or two to bring down longer-term borrowing costs, Bianchi said.\n\u201cTo really lower long-term rates you need to provide a stable macroeconomic environment, and right now we are not there yet,\u201d he added."

But Powell also signaled that it could take months for the Fed to determine whether Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs will push up inflation temporarily or lead to a more persistent bout of higher prices. His comments suggest that a rate cut in September, which had been expected by some economists and investors, is now less likely.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that the process will probably be slower than expected,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe think we have a long way to go to really understand exactly how\u201d the tariffs will affect inflation and the economy.\nThere were some signs of splits in the Fed\u2019s ranks: Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voted to reduce borrowing costs, while nine officials, including Powell, favored standing pat. It is the first time in more than three decades that two of the seven Washington-based governors have dissented. One official, Governor Adriana Kugler, was absent and didn\u2019t vote.\nThe choice to hold off on a rate cut will almost certainly result in further conflict between the Fed and White House, as Trump has repeatedly demanded that the central bank reduce borrowing costs as part of his effort to assert control over one of the few remaining independent federal agencies.\nPowell has in the past signaled during a news conference that a rate move might be on the table for an upcoming meeting, but he gave no such hints this time. The odds of a rate cut in September, according to futures pricing, fell from nearly 60% before the meeting to just 45% after the press conference, the equivalent of a coin flip, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\u201cWe have made no decisions about September,\u201d Powell said. The chair acknowledged that if the Fed cut its rate too soon, inflation could move higher, and if it cut too late, then the job market could suffer.\nMajor U.S. stock indexes, which had been trading slightly higher Wednesday, went negative after Powell\u2019s comments.\n\u201cThe markets seem to think that Powell pushed back on a September rate cut,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, chief market strategist at New York Life Investments.\nPowell also underscored that the vast majority of the committee agreed with a basic framework: Inflation is still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%, while the job market is still mostly healthy, so the Fed should keep rates elevated. On Thursday, the government will release the latest reading of the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, and it is expected to show that core prices, excluding energy and food, rose 2.7% from a year earlier.\nGus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial, says he expects the tariffs will only temporarily raise inflation, but that it will take most of the rest of this year for that to become apparent. He doesn\u2019t expect the Fed to cut until December.\nTrump argues that because the U.S. economy is doing well, rates should be lowered. But unlike a blue-chip company that usually pays lower rates than a troubled startup, it\u2019s different for an entire economy. The Fed adjusts rates to either slow or speed growth, and would be more likely to keep them high if the economy is strong to prevent an inflationary outbreak.\nEarlier Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a healthy 3% annual rate in the second quarter, though that figure followed a negative reading for the first three months of the year, when the economy shrank 0.5% at an annual rate. Most economists averaged the two figures to get a growth rate of about 1.2% for the first half of this year.\nThe dissents from Waller and Bowman likely reflect jockeying to replace Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. Waller in particular has been mentioned as a potential future Fed chair.\nMichael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in a note to clients this week if the pair were to dissent, \u201cit would say more about auditioning for the Fed chair appointment than about economic conditions.\u201d\nBowman, meanwhile, last dissented in September 2024, when the Fed cut its key rate by a half-point. She said she preferred a quarter point cut instead, and cited the fact that inflation was still above 2.5% as a reason for caution.\nWaller said earlier this month that he favored cutting rates, but for very different reasons than Trump has cited: Waller thinks that growth and hiring are slowing, and that the Fed should reduce borrowing costs to forestall a rise in unemployment.\nThere are other camps on the Fed\u2019s 19-member rate-setting committee \u2014 only 12 of the 19 actually vote on rate decisions. In June, seven members signaled that they supported leaving rates unchanged through the end of this year, while two suggested they preferred a single rate cut. The other half supported more reductions, with eight officials backing two cuts, and two \u2014 widely thought to be Waller and Bowman \u2014 supporting three reductions.\nThe dissents could be a preview of what might happen after Powell steps down, if Trump appoints a replacement who pushes for the much lower interest rates the White House desires. Other Fed officials could push back if a future chair sought to cut rates by more than economic conditions would otherwise support.\nOverall, the committee\u2019s quarterly forecasts in June suggested the Fed would cut twice this year. There are only three more Fed policy meetings \u2014 in September, October, and December.\nWhen the Fed cuts its rate, it often \u2014 but not always \u2014 results in lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.\nSome economists agree with Waller\u2019s concerns about the job market. Excluding government hiring, the economy added just 74,000 jobs in June, with most of those gains occurring in health care.\n\u201cWe are in a much slower job hiring backdrop than most people appreciate,\u201d said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at PGIM Fixed Income."
