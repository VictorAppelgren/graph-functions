  "content": "In a nutshell: Millions of people are using smartwatches and other wearable devices every day to keep their stress levels in check. Almost all of them are wrong, researchers say, because there appears to be no correlation between how the body feels and digitally recorded data.\n\nA recently published study says there is \"basically zero\" correlation between data coming from wearable sensors and self-reported stress levels. However, smartwatches and wearable gadgets aren't entirely useless if the user is well aware of the device's limitations.\n\nThe Dutch study tracked stress, fatigue, and sleep data for three months on 800 young adults, using Garmin Vivosmart 4 activity trackers. The researchers asked the study's participants to report how stressed, fatigued, or sleepy they felt four times per day.\n\nAfter cross-referencing the data, the researchers discovered that little correlation existed between the data and the participants' personal experience. None of the 800 subjects got a \"stress score\" on their tracker that matched the level of stress they were feeling. Furthermore, a quarter of the participants were feeling stressed or relaxed while their smartwatches were measuring exactly the opposite.\n\nCo-author Eiko Fried noted that the study's results aren't surprising. The Garmin watch they used measures heart rate, and this particular indicator has nothing to do with the actual emotions felt by a person. For example, heart rate usually goes up just as much during sexual arousal as when someone is angry.\n\n\"The findings raise important questions about what wearable data can or can't tell us about mental states,\" said Fried, warning, \"[You should] be careful and don't live by your smartwatch \u2013 these are consumer devices, not medical devices.\"\n\nThe study also looked at the reliability of Garmin's \"body battery\" feature, which should measure physical fatigue. The relationship between that data and actual personal experience was stronger than mental stress, but still too weak to be relevant. Garmin doesn't explain how the body battery score works, but the researchers suspect it's a combination of pulse measurements and physical activity levels.\n\nWhile smartwatches are mostly useless as stress meters, they could work better for sleep measurements. The tested devices helped measure sleep duration, even though they could tell very little about how rested a person would feel once out of bed.\n\nThis kind of sleep-related data could help developers create a \"warning system\" for depression states, the researchers posited. The watch could alert users when it predicts an episode is about to begin, so they could act beforehand or get the most appropriate treatment.\n\n\"Wearable data can offer valuable insights into people's emotions and experiences,\" said University of Manchester researcher Margarita Panayiotou. \"But it's crucial to understand its potential and limitations.\"",

      "text": "They are supposed to monitor you throughout the working day and help make sure that life is not getting on top of you.\nBut a study has concluded that smartwatches cannot accurately measure your stress levels \u2013 and may think you are overworked when really you are just excited.\nResearchers found almost no relationship between the stress levels reported by the smartwatch and the levels that participants said they experienced. However, recorded fatigue levels had a very slight association with the smartwatch data, while sleep had a stronger correlation.\nEiko Fried, an author of the study, said the correlation between the smartwatch and self-reported stress scores was \u201cbasically zero\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cThis is no surprise to us given that the watch measures heart rate and heart rate doesn\u2019t have that much to do with the emotion you\u2019re experiencing \u2013 it also goes up for sexual arousal or joyful experiences.\u201d\nHe noted that his Garmin had previously told him he was stressed when he was working out in the gym and when excitedly talking to a friend he had not seen for a while at a wedding.\n\u201cThe findings raise important questions about what wearable data can or can\u2019t tell us about mental states,\u201d said Fried. \u201cBe careful and don\u2019t live by your smartwatch \u2013 these are consumer devices, not medical devices.\u201d\nFried said although there was a lot of academic work looking for physiological signals that can act as proxies for emotional states, most were not precise enough. This is because there is an overlap between positive and negative feelings \u2013 for example, hair standing on end can signal anxiety as well as excitement.\nFried, an associate professor in the department of clinical psychology at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and his team tracked stress, fatigue and sleep for three months on 800 young adults wearing Garmin vivosmart 4 watches. They asked them to report four times a day on how stressed, fatigued or sleepy users were feeling before cross-referencing the data.\nAnd the results, published in the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, found that none of the participants saw the stress scores on their watches meet the baseline for significant change when they recorded feeling stressed. And for a quarter of participants, their smartwatch told them they were stressed or unstressed when they self-reported feeling the opposite.\nThe relationship with physical fatigue, described by Garmin as \u201cbody battery\u201d, was \u201cquite a bit stronger than for stress but overall quite weak\u201d said Fried. Garmin does not disclose the calculations it uses to work out the body battery score, though he suspected it was a combination of a pulse measurement and activity levels.\nThe relationship with sleep was stronger again, though Fried noted it measured sleep duration and told us little about how well rested someone was, other than the fact there tended to be a relationship between how long you slept and how well rested you felt.\nThere was a significant association between the Garmin and self-reported data for two-thirds of the sample for sleep. The researchers noted that in nearly all cases, if participants went from one day of self-reporting bad sleep quality, to another day with a good score, they could predict an increase in sleep duration on the Garmin of around two hours. \u201cThis is a really noticeable effect,\u201d they said.\nThe research is intended to feed into an early warning system for depression, in which wearable tech users receive data that will help them receive preventive treatments before an episode begins.\nSo far, there are promising signs that lower activity levels could be a predictor, though Fried has been unable to identify whether this is because of exercise\u2019s protective effect against depression or because people feel less energetic as their mental state deteriorates.\n\u201cWearable data can offer valuable insights into people\u2019s emotions and experiences, but it\u2019s crucial to understand its potential and limitations,\u201d said Margarita Panayiotou, a researcher at the University of Manchester, after reading the study.\n\u201cThis research helps clarify what such data can reliably reveal and makes an important contribution to ongoing discussions about the role of technology in understanding wellbeing. It\u2019s important to remember that wearable data does not necessarily represent objective truth and should be interpreted alongside broader context, including individuals\u2019 perceptions and lived experiences.\u201d\nGarmin has been approached for comment."
