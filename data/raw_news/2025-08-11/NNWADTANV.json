  "description": "Rapper T-Hood, who was reportedly dating the daughter of known Atlanta hip-hop artist Rasheeda Frost, died in a shooting, cops say.",
  "content": "Gwinnett County Police on Monday identified Hood as the 33-year-old man killed in the shooting, which occurred around 7 p.m. Friday at a home. A 911 caller told dispatch that a dispute had taken place and that a man had been shot, police said.\n\nFirst responders took Hood to a local hospital, where he died of his injuries, police said. An unnamed person was detained on scene, but police did not release any possible charges in the case. Officers are investigating the shooting as a homicide, police said.\n\nHood, of \"Perculator\" fame, was reportedly dating the daughter of Atlanta's own Kirk and Rasheeda Frost. The Frosts, entrepreneurs and \"Love and Hip-Hop: Atlanta\" cast members, were first known as part of Atlanta's rap scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their daughter, Kelsie Frost, was Hood's girlfriend and was the focal point of rumors surrounding his death, the Shade Room reported.\n\n\"Just come get me baby please\u2026..\ud83d\ude4f I can\u2019t even type this. I love you papa. I can\u2019t wait to hold you again,\" read one of her Instagram posts on Monday, which included photos and video clips of she and Hood. Per Shade Room on Sunday, Kelsie Frost expressed not wanting to hurt Hood in an Instagram post, which appears to no longer be shared.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit back and let this narrative being created go on. The love of my life is GONE. I am sick to my stomach. I don\u2019t wish this on anyone. I don\u2019t even have time to grieve or say my respects in the right manner because I am defending myself, being attacked by the people who are creating weird and sick rumors. ... Y\u2019all hear pick and choose what you want but I didn\u2019t want this, ask for it, call for it, set up ask for anything I WOULD NEVER!!!!!!! Stop playing on my name real ones know, he wouldn\u2019t approve!!!!!\u201d A motive in the deadly shooting is unknown. ALSO SEE: Get The Latest Local News (For Free!) With One Quick Tap",
