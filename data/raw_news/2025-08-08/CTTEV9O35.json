  "description": "U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee lashed out at British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over his response to Israel's plan to take control over Gaza City, suggesting Friday that the United Kingdom would have lost World War II had Starmer had been in charge.",
  "content": "U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee lashed out at British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over his response to Israel's plan to take control over Gaza City, suggesting Friday that the United Kingdom would have lost World War II had Starmer had been in charge.\n\nStarmer posted a statement early Friday on X in which he said, \"The Israeli Government's decision to further escalate its offensive in Gaza is wrong, and we urge it to reconsider immediately. Every day, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens and hostages taken by Hamas are being held in appalling and inhuman conditions. We need a ceasefire now.\"\n\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vehemently denied reports that Israel has created a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. He has vowed to continue the military operation that began after Iranian-backed Hamas' terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, until Hamas is destroyed and the reamining 50 hostages, about 20 of whom are presumed to be alive, are returned. Hamas has resisted several attempts at a ceasefire deal.\n\nThe U.K., France, and other countries are working on a long-term plan to secure peace in the region through a two-state solution, with France already recognizing a Palestinian state. Starmer threatened to do the same in September if Israel doesn't take substantive steps to allow more aid to enter Gaza, make clear there will be no annexation of the West Bank, and commit to a long-term peace process that delivers a Palestinian state coexisting in peace alongside Israel.\n\n\"So, Israel is expected to surrender to Hamas & feed them even though Israeli hostages are being starved?\" Huckabee responded Friday morning in a post on X. \"Did UK surrender to Nazis and drop food to them? Ever heard of Dresden, PM Starmer? That wasn't food you dropped. If you had been PM then, UK would be speaking German!\"\n\nMore than 3,400 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices were dropped on Dresden, Germany, in World War II by more than 800 American and British aircraft over two days in February 1945, according to history.com. The firestorm created by the bombings set the city ablaze for many more days. Between 22,700 and 25,000 were believed to have been killed.\n\n\"How much food has Starmer, and the UK sent to Gaza?\" Huckabee wrote in another post on X. \"@IsraeliPM has already sent 2 MILLION TONS into Gaza & none of it even getting to hostages. Maybe UK PM ought to sit this one out & follow Arab League who said Hamas should disarm & release ALL hostages immediately.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Starmer declined to comment to the BBC.",

If you had been PM then UK would be speaking German!\" he said.\nHis comments come after Starmer condemned Israel's plans to take over Gaza City as \"wrong\" and urged its government to immediately reconsider its decision \"to further escalate its offensive\".\nA spokesperson for No 10 said they had nothing to add to Starmer's comments.\nIn his post on X on Friday, in which he reposted a statement by Starmer, Huckabee said: \"Ever heard of Dresden, PM Starmer?\n\"That wasn't food you dropped. If you had been PM then UK would be speaking German!\"\nDuring World War Two, British and American forces dropped 4,000 tons of bombs on the eastern German city over two days, killing tens of thousands of civilians.\nStarmer's earlier statement said: \"The Israeli Government's decision to further escalate its offensive in Gaza is wrong, and we urge it to reconsider immediately.\n\"This action will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the release of the hostages. It will only bring more bloodshed,\" he added.\nIn the early hours of Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet approved plans to take over Gaza's capital, in a controversial escalation of its war in the territory.\nNetanyahu has previously said he wants to take control of the whole of the Gaza Strip but the approved plan focuses specifically on Gaza City in the territory's north, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians live.\nIsrael's move has been staunchly opposed, including from within Israel, such as by members of the country's army leadership and the families of hostages being held in Gaza.\nThe plan has also been heavily criticised internationally. The United Nations' human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk warned further escalation of the war would cause \"more massive forced displacement, more killing, more unbearable suffering\".\nFollowing the announcement of Israel's plan, Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the country would suspend the export of arms to Israel, which could be used in Gaza, saying it was \"increasingly difficult to understand\" how Israel's military plan would achieve legitimate aims.\nHowever, the US has not condemned the move. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said it was \"pretty much up to Israel\" whether to fully occupy Gaza.\nDuring a meeting with the UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy in Kent on Friday, US Vice-President JD Vance refused to disclose whether the US government knew about Israel's plans to take over Gaza City.\nHe added that Trump would address the issue, saying their aim is to stop Hamas \"attacking innocent people\" and to solve humanitarian problems in Gaza.\nNetanyahu and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have outlined five \"principles\" for ending the war.\nThese include the disarmament of Hamas, the return of all Israeli hostages, the demilitarisation of the Gaza Strip, Israeli security control over the Gaza Strip and the establishment of an alternative civilian administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.\nMore than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the IDF began its military operation, in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nFifty hostages are still being held by Hamas - 20 of whom are believed to still be alive."

The tragic irony of the raid on Dresden, a medieval city renowned for its rich artistic and architectural treasures, is that during the war it had never been a site of war-production or major industry.\nBoth Allies and Germans alike have argued over the real purpose of the firebombing; the ostensible \u201cofficial\u201d rationale was that Dresden was a major communications center and bombing it would hamper the German ability to convey messages to its army, which was battling Soviet forces at the time. But the extent of the destruction was, for many, disproportionate to the stated strategic goal\u2014many believe that the attack was simply an attempt to punish the Germans and weaken their morale.\nMore than 3,400 tons of explosives were dropped on the city by 800 American and British aircraft. The firestorm created by the two days of bombing set the city burning for many more days, littering the streets with charred corpses, including many children. Eight square miles of the city was ruined, and the total body count was between 22,700 and 25,000 dead, according to a report published by the city of Dresden in 2010. The hospitals that were left standing could not handle the numbers of injured and burned, and mass burials became necessary.\nAmong the American POWs who were in Dresden during the raid was novelist Kurt Vonnegut, who conveyed his experience in his classic antiwar novel Slaughterhouse Five.\nTimeline\nDiscover more of the major events, famous births, notable deaths and everything else history-making that happened on February 13th\nRelated Articles\nThey were a crucial Soviet asset to winning World War II.\nExplore five defining events that led to the conclusion of World War II on September 2, 1945.\nMany Allied bombings released the equivalent energy of 300 lightning strikes and temporarily weakened the ionosphere, say researchers.\nHitler's 1942 decision to attack the city named after the Soviet leader proved devastating and fateful.\nAbout the author\nHISTORY.com works with a wide range of writers and editors to create accurate and informative content.
