  "title": "Sony WF-1000XM6: everything you need to know",
  "description": "The expected release date, price and design for Sony's next-gen flagship earbuds, due this year.",
  "content": "The Sony WF-1000XM6 are expected to be the hottest wireless earbuds release of 2025, not least if the AirPods Pro 3 don\u2019t show up until early 2026. The highly anticipated successors to Sony\u2019s benchmark-setting WF-1000XM5, which top our best wireless earbuds buying guide, could well arrive within weeks, according to rumors and the model\u2019s launch cycle history.\n\nNaturally, they will have big shoes to fill, but if Sony\u2019s flagship WF-1000XM earbuds line has nailed anything over the years, it\u2019s consistency. Indeed, expectations are high.\n\nSo what do we know so far about Sony\u2019s next-gen flagships, when will they arrive, what will they cost, and what improvements do I want to see over the class-leading XM5?\n\u2022 Sony WF-1000XM6 price is expected to be between $300 and $330\n\u2022 The XM6 earbuds should adopt a very similar shape and size to the current-gen WF-1000XM5\n\nWhen will the Sony WF-1000XM6 launch?\n\nWhile Sony hasn\u2019t yet confirmed the WF-1000XM6\u2019s existence, the XM6\u2019s release date is likely to be sometime this year, based on leaks and my own educated guess.\n\nFirstly, I can see that an import filing for a pair of Sony earbuds, spotted by The Walkman Blog (via Notebook Check), was listed in May (and posted online more recently). The filing refers to them as \u2018HDX-2985\u2019, which TWB states refers to the WF-1000XM6.\n\nA previous filing in March, also presumed to be Sony\u2019s next-gen flagship earbuds, referenced the code \u2018YY2985\u2019. Internally used codenames are often used for such listings, with the XM5 listed as \u2018YY2963\u2019 prior to their release.\n\nThis suggests that the XM6\u2019s arrival is nigh, as does the launch cycle of the flagship line. After all, the current WF-1000XM5 arrived in July 2023, while the previous XM4 appeared in June 2021, and the XM3 before them debuted in August 2019.\n\nThere is a clear biennial release for this reference model, strongly suggesting that the XM6 will arrive in summer 2025 \u2013 likely in August or perhaps even September, given that June and July have already passed without them showing up.\n\nHow much will the Sony WF-1000XM6 cost?\n\nI can also make a good educated guess at the WF-1000XM6\u2019s launch price based on the RRP of the previous iterations. The XM5 were priced at $300, the XM4 at $280.\n\nThis puts them dead-center in the premium end of the market alongside their closest rivals, namely the Apple AirPods Pro 2 ($249), Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen ($299) and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 ($299.95).\n\nDespite a handful of pricier wireless earbuds having emerged in recent years, such as the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 ($399) and Master & Dynamic MW09 ($399), I can\u2019t see Sony raising the price of its flagship line by much (perhaps a 10% increase to $330), if anything at all.\n\nSony recently introduced its flagship over-ear wireless headphones, the exceptional WH-1000XM6, for $449 \u2013 $50 more than the WH-1000XM5 debuted for in 2022 \u2013 so it isn\u2019t shy of a price rise. But it will want the XM6\u2019s price to compete with that of the rumored AirPods Pro 3, which are expected to keep the Pro 2\u2019s $249 RRP.\n\nWithin Sony\u2019s range of wireless earbuds, this $300-330 price tag would compare to the $160 launch price of the mid-range LinkBuds S, the $120 debut price of the mid-range WF-C710N, and the $60 RRP of the budget WF-C510.\n\nAside from a probable 2025 release date, we are mostly in the dark when it comes to leaked information about the Sony WF-1000XM6.\n\nThat aforementioned filing from May (via The Walkman Blog) shows the size of the various molds used to produce parts of the XM6\u2019s packaging, and from this we can deduce that Sony hasn\u2019t made any crazy departures from the XM5\u2019s size and shape. The XM6\u2019s box is roughly 15mm shorter while being slightly wider and deeper, but the insert for the charging case remains similar.\n\nKeeping the XM5\u2019s general form is, in my mind, a good idea. The current earbuds are welcomely smaller, lighter and more streamlined than the previous-gen XM4, with our WF-1000XM5 review praising their \u201csmall, smooth, and elegant\u201d earbud form as well as their \u201cmore rounded, lozenge-like shape\u2026 pocket-friendly\u201d charging case.\n\nAside from the size and shape of the XM6, then, leaks are thin on the ground. But that doesn\u2019t stop us from curating our own wish list for the WF-1000XM6 based on the improvements we would like to see over the XM5\u2026\n\nSony WF-1000XM6: what we want to see\n\nIt\u2019s only natural to expect a jump in audio and noise-canceling performance from one generation of earbuds to the next, and indeed Sony has never been one to rest on its laurels in either department. But there are four changes to the design and features that, to my eyes and ears, would also help to make these the perfect premium wireless earbuds.\n\nOur expert found that when testing the WF-1000XM5 against other Sony earbuds, they did not \u201csit as securely as the XM4 or LinkBuds S\u2026 limit[ing] the appeal of the XM5 for running or gym use\u201d. While the import filing suggests Sony is probably largely sticking to the same size and shape for its next-gen earbuds, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t have made design tweaks \u2013 either to the earbud structure or the supplied eartips, or both \u2013 to improve fit. Fingers crossed.\n\nWhen the XM5 launched, their battery life of eight hours in the earbuds (with ANC on) and 16 hours in the charging case, for a total 24-hour battery life, was highly competitive. It can still be considered very decent today, but some rivals have now surpassed those numbers. The juicepack of our favorite budget wireless earbuds, the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, offers a 40-hour total, for example. With the XM6, I would like to see Sony hit at least a 30-hour total.\n\nLike the Bose QC Ultra 2nd Gen and AirPods Pro 2, the current XM5 support head-tracked spatial audio, allowing owners to enjoy an immersive \u20183D\u2019 soundfield that adapts according to the position of their head. However, our reviewer found that its application was limited to certain apps and devices. He also noted that it is \u201cnot as smooth or convincing as Apple\u2019s version of head-tracked spatial on the AirPods Pro Gen 2\u201d. Needless to say, this is one area that I hope Sony focuses on for the XM6.\n\nChanging the XM5\u2019s volume on-bud means tapping one of the buds four times \u2013 the right earbud raises the volume, the left lowers it. Our expert reviewer found this gesture \u201cexcessive and kind of awkward\u201d and didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that it couldn\u2019t be changed in the accompanying Sony Headphones app. Fewer taps or some sort of sliding motion gesture would be much more preferable.",

      "text": "\u201cThe Master & Dynamic MW09 justify every penny with a design and materials that are second to none.\u201d\n- Beautiful design and materials\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Capable noise-canceling\n- Huge amounts of battery life\n- Bluetooth Multipoint\n- Wireless charging\n- A bit heavy for workouts\n- Long delay between ANC modes\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nPerhaps more than any other personal audio brand, New York City\u2019s Master & Dynamic (M&D) pays as much attention to how its products look and feel as it does to how they sound. Look no further than the company\u2019s latest wireless earbuds, the MW09, for a perfect example.\nDo you need earbuds that are constructed from aluminum and glass? Of course not. But since when do we just focus on what we need?\nFortunately, the MW09\u2019s desirability is more than skin deep. To help justify their $349 starting price, M&D has covered the gamut by adding hi-res audio, wireless charging, Bluetooth Multipoint, a new AI-driven active noise canceling system \u2014 and to top it off, an absolutely gigantic amount of battery life. The question is whether the MW09\u2019s combo of beauty and brains seal the deal, or if you should look elsewhere.\nI spent the better part of a week with one of the first production MW09 to find out. The earbuds will be available for preorder at masterdynamic.com starting November 14.\nM&D MW09: design\nI can\u2019t ditch the feeling that if Steve Jobs had been able to design a set of wireless earbuds to accompany the launch of the iPhone 4 in 2010, they would have looked a lot like the MW09. At the time, the iPhone 4\u2019s use of stainless steel-framed glass panels made it by far the sleekest smartphone that had ever been designed, and the MW09\u2019s combination of sapphire crystal and aluminum create the same effect. I think they\u2019re stunning.\nThe raised, circular section of the earbuds, which bears the M&D logo, looks like it\u2019s a touch control. The sapphire crystal disk fits seamlessly and invisibly into the ringed frame. It\u2019s so smooth that when you run your finger over it, it could provide the perfect surface for taps, swipes, and other gestures. But M&D has always favored physical buttons for its earbuds and headphones, and the MW09 use the same top-mounted controls as the company\u2019s previous models.\nWhen you buy the MW09, you can pick from two kinds of charging case: aluminum or Kevlar. There\u2019s no difference between their battery capacities or their IPX4 water protection, and both support wireless charging (the MW08\u2019s steel case option did not). But the Kevlar case weighs a little less \u2014 1.7 ounces versus 2.2 ounces for the aluminum case \u2014 and it might prove more durable. I\u2019m not sure these distinctions are worth paying the extra $50 unless you also really dig the Kevlar\u2019s carbon-fiber-esque look.\nThe Kevlar model comes in green, blue, and gunmetal, while the aluminum version comes in black, white and silver, and gold \u2014 each with a color-matched case.\nRegardless of which one you choose, the build quality is superb. Everything about the MW09 communicates luxury and precision, like an expensive Swiss watch or a German sports car.\nM&D MW09: comfort and controls\nThere\u2019s no getting around the fact that aluminum and glass weigh more than plastic. The MW09 earbuds tip the scales at 8.1 grams (0.28 ounces) each, which doesn\u2019t sound like a lot until you realize that the Apple AirPods Pro are just 0.19 ounces and the Sony WF-1000XM5 are 0.2 ounces.\nAdding almost 50% more mass could prove troublesome, but the MW09 have proven very comfortable for me \u2014 even for several hours at a time. Not only is their shape very ergonomic, but they also ship with a generous number of eartips: five sizes of silicone and two sizes of foam, which should help most people find a good fit. To help, the M&D Connect app now has a simple fit test that can check for a good seal.\nYou may notice the extra weight when jogging or working out. The main mass of the earbud sits outside the ear\u2019s concha, so the pounding of high-impact activities can be felt as gravity tugs on the MW09. It\u2019s not a deal breaker, and with an IP54 rating, the earbuds won\u2019t come to any harm if you use them at the gym, as long as you clean them after use. But there are certainly better choices if workouts are a top priority.\nAs with previous M&D earbuds, the MW09\u2019s controls are easy to use. Between the large multifunction button on the right earbud and the two-way rocker button on the left, all functions are covered, including playback, volume, call management, ANC/transparency modes, and activating your phone\u2019s voice assistant. There\u2019s no way to modify what the buttons control. But it\u2019s such an intuitive setup that I doubt you\u2019ll want to.\nEach button provides excellent tactile response, but using them requires a kind of pinching movement in which you grip the earbud between your thumb and forefinger. It\u2019s a cinch with bare hands, but doing it with gloves on could be tricky, especially when trying to locate the front versus the rear rocker. On the plus side, it\u2019s nearly impossible to trigger a command accidentally when inserting or removing them from your ears.\nRounding out the controls are a set of wear sensors. These can be used to pause your tunes when you remove the earbuds, and they can power down the buds if they sense they\u2019ve been out of your ears for longer than 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 3 hours.\nM&D MW09: connections and codecs\nHi-res and lossless audio get a lot of buzz these days, so it\u2019s not surprising that M&D wanted the MW09 to be as leading edge as possible in terms of format support. In addition to the bog-standard SBC and AAC lossy Bluetooth codecs, the earbuds are also Snapdragon Sound compatible, which adds aptX Adaptive for lossy hi-res at up to 24-bit/96kHz, as well as lossless CD quality at up to 16-bit/48kHz \u2014 but that last option requires an equally capable Snapdragon Sound phone. There are still precious few of those to be had. And, of course, we\u2019re talking Android.\nMore relevant for iPhone owners \u2014 no Apple devices are compatible with hi-res or lossless audio over Bluetooth. I\u2019ll discuss how all of this affects sound quality in a moment.\nWhat\u2019s universally useful is the MW09\u2019s Bluetooth Multipoint capability. It lets you connect the earbuds to two devices simultaneously, and the M&D Connect app allows you you manage which two of these devices should be in play at any given time. Switching between active devices is seamless.\nWith Bluetooth 5.4 compatibility, M&D has prepped the MW09 for the coming wave of Bluetooth LE Audio devices and applications, including Bluetooth Auracast. It\u2019s unlikely your current phone can support these yet, but it\u2019s nice to know that you won\u2019t need to upgrade your earbuds when you upgrade (or simply update) your phone.\nM&D MW09: sound quality\nWhen it comes to sound quality, M&D is its own competition. I still consider the company\u2019s MW08 and MW08 Sport some of the best-sounding wireless earbuds you can buy, so my first question was how the MW09 compare.\nAs expected, they sound fantastic. The MW09 preserve everything I love about the MW08 \u2014 the full and rich sound, commanding yet musical bass, detailed midranges, and crystal clear highs \u2014 and then they go just a bit further. There\u2019s a slight improvement in detail, with better separation between frequencies. The soundstage also has benefited. It\u2019s wider and yet more precise, giving a greater sense of immersion and realism.\nIn the app, there\u2019s now a small set of EQ presets, plus a manual five-band equalizer, something M&D has avoided in the past. I said I was OK with this absence on the MW08 given how good they sound right out of the box, but I\u2019m not going to lie, I like that you can tweak the MW09\u2019s sound signature \u2014 I just wish there were a way to save manual EQ settings.\nAnd what about the rest of the competition? The MW09 find themselves up against the $280 Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3, $298 Sony WF-1000XM5, $300 Technics EAH-AZ80, and $399 Bowers & Wilkins (B&W) Pi7 S2.\nIt\u2019s not much of a competition. Sadly for Sennheiser, B&W, and Technics, Sony is the only one of the four that can give M&D buyers a real alternative to the MW09 in terms of sound quality. The MW09 and WF-1000XM5 are well-matched in terms of tone and clarity, but each has its strengths. The MW09 excels at high-frequency clarity like vocals, while the XM5 provides more power to the lower end of the scale. The best one for you will likely come down to personal preference \u2014 I think they\u2019re both best in class.\nAs for the MW09\u2019s hi-res and lossless chops via Snapdragon Sound, I was able to hear a perceptible difference while using a Snapdragon-equipped Motorola ThinkPhone versus lossy audio on the iPhone 14. The ThinkPhone provided more detail, better separation of instruments, and much-improved bass musicality. The usual caveat for hi-res audio remains: You\u2019ll need a compatible phone, a source of hi-res music, and a very quiet space in order to appreciate its benefits.\nM&D MW09: noise cancellation and transparency\nIf you want the best active noise cancellation (ANC) in a set of wireless earbuds, you\u2019re still looking at the AirPods Pro, WF-1000XM5, and Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. These three are in a class by themselves. The same thing is true of their transparency modes.\nHowever, outside of that holy trinity of silence, the MW09 more than hold their own, providing noise cancellation that I found to be all I needed when riding transit or simply walking busy streets. M&D says that the MW09 improve the ability to cancel low-frequency sounds when compared to the MW08. I wasn\u2019t able to hear that. But with the foam eartips installed, they both performed very well. Transparency (or ambient as M&D calls it) is similarly capable, letting you hear conversations and important announcements, or just giving you better situational awareness. Your voice is the one thing that won\u2019t sound quite as clear as everything else, but again, only Apple, Sony, and Bose do a better job.\nThe one thing I\u2019d like to see M&D improve is the time it takes to switch between ANC modes. From the moment you press and hold on the rocker buttons, it takes 4 to 5 seconds to go from ANC off to ANC on, or from ANC off to ambient on. I realize it can\u2019t be instant (yet), but since many other companies have managed faster times (typically 2 to 2.5 seconds or less), I think M&D should be able to shorten its time, too.\nM&D MW09: call quality\nM&D has made some big strides in call quality on the MW09, which provide noticeably clearer voice transmission than the MW08. The gain on the mics has also been amped up a hair, so your callers won\u2019t have to bump up their volume as much to hear you.\nThe MW09 still trail the Apple AirPods Pro and Sony WF-1000XM5 when it comes to keeping background sounds from breaking through \u2014 if you happen to be in an especially noisy environment, your voice will suffer from a lot of compression \u2014 but we\u2019re talking worst-case situations like having a garbage truck roll past you. The rest of the time, they sound great, and it can verge on studio quality when indoors.\nNew to the MW09 is a sidetone option. Sidetone lets you hear your own voice more clearly when on calls, which not only sounds more natural, but it also reduces fatigue. It does a good job when in ANC mode, but for the most natural sound, you\u2019ll want to have Ambient and sidetone modes enabled.\nM&D MW09: battery life\nThere\u2019s only one way to say this: The M&D MW09 have more battery life than you\u2019re ever likely to need. At a claimed 12 hours per charge with ANC on and a huge 16 hours with it off, I never came close to exhausting their capacity during testing. Even if I wanted to, I don\u2019t think I could stand to wear any earbuds for 12 hours without pause. When you take into account the case\u2019s capacity (another 32 hours) and a fast-charge system that adds three hours of playtime for just 10 minutes of charging, the MW09 are never going to let you down when you need them.\nThough they\u2019re at the pricier end of the wireless earbuds market, the Master & Dynamic MW09 justify every penny with a design and materials that are second to none, sound quality that is arguably the best in their class, and more battery life than most people will ever need.\nThey may not rank in the top three for ANC, transparency, or call quality, but neither will they disappoint. And with a future-proofed Snapdragon Sound chipset, along with full LE Audio support, there\u2019s a good chance that these earbuds will still be useful and usable long after others have ceased to be.\nIf you\u2019re a happy MW08 owner \u2014 especially if you have the MW08 Sport \u2014 I don\u2019t think you need to rush out and buy the MW09. But if you\u2019ve been thinking of giving M&D a try, there\u2019s never been a better time."

      "text": "- Thoughtful design\n- Great sound\n- Impressive noise-canceling\n- Very good call quality\n- Superb battery life\n- Bluetooth Multipoint\n- Mediocre transparency mode\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nWhat can you expect from a $100 set of wireless earbuds? If they\u2019re the new Buy at Amazon , the answer is a whole heck of a lot. Go ahead and consult your list of must-have features \u2014 I can virtually guarantee the Liberty 4 NC check all of those boxes, and then some. And unlike some other value-oriented brands, Soundcore is making real strides in its designs. The Liberty 4 NC aren\u2019t just decent earbuds, they\u2019re also a joy to use.\nFirst, let\u2019s address Soundcore\u2019s somewhat-confusing naming strategy for its earbuds. The Liberty 4 NC might be newer than the 2022 Soundcore Liberty 4 ($150), but they\u2019re actually Soundcore\u2019s step-down model.\nSoundcore gives plenty of reasons to spend the extra $50 on the Liberty 4, like better drivers, head-tracked spatial audio, and even built-in heart-rate sensors. But if you just want to focus on getting the best earbuds for the lowest price, the Liberty 4 NC won\u2019t leave you wishing you\u2019d spent more. At the same time, if you like stem-based earbuds, I think the NC represent a very worthy step up from the $80 Soundcore Life P3 \u2014 I\u2019ll explain why as we go.\nSoundcore Liberty 4 NC: design\nThe strides in design I mentioned earlier aren\u2019t limited to the Liberty 4 NC themselves. Anker also has given them a fully recyclable cardboard- and paper-based package. No plastic of any kind. That\u2019s a huge shift for a company that used to use oversized boxes, layers of plastic, embedded magnets, and glossy-coated surfaces, so I\u2019m giving it big props.\nThe design improvements can also be seen in the Liberty 4 NC\u2019s charging case. It\u2019s not quite as slender as Apple\u2019s AirPods cases, but it\u2019s still reasonably pocketable. It charges wirelessly or via the included USB-C cable. What I like most is that it flips open one-handed with a press of the front button. The Liberty 4 weren\u2019t hard to get to either, but the NC are better. There\u2019s more space between the buds for your fingers, and there\u2019s more of the upper portion of each earbud to grip. Extracting the earbuds is easy, but putting them back is almost easier \u2014 just get an earbud in the general vicinity of its charging socket and the magnets do the rest.\nThat lid-release button does triple duty: it\u2019s also an LED indicator to show the charging status of the case, and if you press it down further, it triggers the earbuds\u2019 Bluetooth pairing mode. If you like color choice, you\u2019ll probably love that the NC come in white, light blue, navy blue (pictured here), pink, and black.\nSoundcore Liberty 4 NC: comfort and fit\nSoundcore has kept the IPX4 water-resistance rating from its other wireless earbuds, so the same guidance applies here too: Don\u2019t fear getting rain or sweat on them, but keep them from being submerged, and always wipe them clean and dry before putting them away.\nIf you want to use them for runs or workouts, they should be fine unless you need something super secure. I found them incredibly comfortable, but they did move around a little bit. Consider the Soundcore Space A40 if you need a sportier fit.\nSoundcore Liberty 4 NC: controls\nAnother improvement is the controls. Soundcore moved to a set of stem-based pinch controls for the Liberty 4 \u2014 which work very similarly to the controls on the Apple AirPods 3rd Gen/AirPods Pro \u2014 but the NC model sticks with touch controls. I still prefer the pinch controls, but the NC\u2019s touch controls are excellent. They\u2019re more responsive and easier to use than the Life P3, and they have a reassuring feedback tone when you tap correctly. As with previous Soundcore models, the app provides an impressive array of customizations, with four gestures per earbud and each can be assigned its own function.\nThanks to the new addition of wear sensors, not only can the Liberty 4 NC auto-pause and resume your tunes when you remove/replace an earbud, but you can also prevent the touch controls from responding when you\u2019re not wearing the earbuds. It\u2019s kind of like when a car prevents you from shifting out of park unless your foot\u2019s on the brake.\nSoundcore Liberty 4 NC: noise-canceling and transparency\nWhen Anker announced these earbuds, it made a pretty audacious claim for the active noise cancellation feature: They reduce ambient sound by up to 98.5%. Given that Soundcore\u2019s ANC has always been perfectly fine, but nowhere near as good as the best noise-canceling earbuds like the Apple AirPods Pro 2, I was skeptical. I still doubt that the Liberty 4 NC cancel almost all sounds, but I\u2019ll tell you this: You probably won\u2019t care. They\u2019re that good. In comparing them to the AirPods Pro 2, I found that the Soundcores let in a little more high-frequency sound. But unless you were to do a series of A/B comparisons between the two, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d notice.\nAnker throws in a lot of bells and whistles for its ANC mode. You can choose to use adaptive noise canceling \u2014 with or without an additional environment detection option \u2014 or use one of four transportation modes (planes, trains, buses, and cars), or you can go full manual by adjusting the amount of ANC with a slider. I only spent a bit of time playing with these, but in the end I found I was content to leave adaptive ANC on with environment detection \u2014 it seemed to produce the best results.\nBut here\u2019s a tip \u2014 about tips. The free Soundcore companion app (iOS, Android) has an eartip fit test, which is handy for figuring out which of the four included sizes you should use. For me, it rated the default medium tips as an acceptable fit for my ears. However, I didn\u2019t think ANC was especially good, so I went up a size. What a difference! In other words, regardless of what the app says, try all of the eartips until you get the best sound and noise cancellation. If there\u2019s one thing I wish the Liberty 4 NC had, it\u2019s a few more eartip sizes to choose from.\nTransparency mode is arguably harder to do well than ANC. Getting things to sound like you aren\u2019t actually wearing earbuds is something that only Apple has been able to achieve with consistently great results. Still, the Liberty 4 NC\u2019s transparency is perfectly serviceable and lets in plenty of sounds so you can be aware of your surroundings, even if your own voice may not sound completely natural.\nSwitching between these modes is easy \u2014 a long press on the left earbud \u2014 but for some reason this control doesn\u2019t work while on a call. If you want to do that, you need to use the app\u2019s mode switch toggle, or end your call and start again in your preferred mode.\nSoundcore Liberty 4 NC: call quality\nSpeaking of calls, the Liberty 4 NC are very good for call quality. If loud sounds happen nearby, your voice will get heavily compressed. But that\u2019s about the only indication that your callers will have. I had a garbage truck roll slowly past me while I was doing my test recording and there was no audible trace of it at all. Indoors, you\u2019ll sound almost as good on these earbuds as you would on your phone\u2019s built-in mic. You definitely don\u2019t need to upgrade to the Liberty 4 \u2014 they perform identically.\nSoundcore Liberty 4 NC: sound quality\nThe Liberty 4 NC might be the formal successor to the Life P3, but their sound quality is actually much closer to the Liberty 4. Overall, I was really impressed.\nThey deliver a more robust and better-balanced sound signature, especially in the midbass and bass that the Life P3 lacked. From an EQ perspective, the Liberty 4 NC and Liberty 4 are nearly identical. Both offer excellent bass response and very clear and articulate mids and highs.\nThe Liberty 4 NC are mostly free of distortion at volume levels that can be enjoyed safely and pain-free. But those who are sensitive to sibilance may want to consider the similarly-priced Jabra Elite 4, or the step-up Liberty 4.\nSpecific tuning preferences can be achieved within the Soundcore app \u2014 it has tons of EQ options. There\u2019s a huge range of presets, a manual eight-band equalizer for custom settings, a fun 3D surround sound mode that presents a wider soundstage, plus the HearID Sound system which attempts to develop a personalized EQ for you based on your ability to perceive various frequencies. If you don\u2019t mind spending some time in there, you can significantly alter the way the Liberty 4 NC sound.\nOn a set of earbuds like the Liberty 4 NC, the use of a hi-res Bluetooth codec like LDAC probably is overkill. I was hard-pressed to notice a big difference when swapping between an iPhone (AAC-only) and a Pixel 7 Pro (LDAC). On the other hand, because you can\u2019t have Bluetooth Multipoint and LDAC enabled simultaneously, it wasn\u2019t exactly easy to hear these two modes in quick succession. My advice is to pick Bluetooth Multipoint over LDAC \u2014 the convenience of having two connected devices far outweighs any benefits the higher-quality codec can offer on a day-to-day basis.\nSoundcore Liberty 4 NC: battery life\nBattery life on the Liberty 4 NC is yet another area where Soundcore seems to keep finding ways to make small but meaningful improvements, especially in total playtime. The company claims you\u2019ll get eight hours of playtime per charge with ANC turned on, with a total of 40 hours when you include the charging case. That\u2019s considerably better than the AirPods Pro (5.5/24 hours), and even slightly better than the Soundcore Liberty 4 (7/24).\nWant even longer life? Disabling ANC ups these numbers to 10/50, which is a huge amount of time before needing to find a cable. Even the quick-charge time is notable: 10 minutes in the case will extend the earbuds\u2019 non-ANC time by four hours.\nKeep in mind that these numbers are all based on listening at 50% volume. Louder levels will diminish battery life as will the use of LDAC. When both LDAC and ANC are enabled, Anker says you can expect 5/25 hours of use, which is almost exactly what I got when I was testing them.\nWith the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, Anker has once again pushed our expectations for wireless earbuds that cost $100. With great battery life, noise cancellation that is way better than anything else at this price \u2014 and arguably better than what you get at double the price \u2014 plus tons of convenience features like wireless charging, Bluetooth Multipoint, wear sensors, and plenty of EQ options. I didn\u2019t even touch on other extras like the earbuds locator, safe volume control, or gaming mode.\nYou may not notice much of a difference, but if you like knowing you\u2019re getting the very best sound possible (and you\u2019re an Android user), the addition of LDAC support is a nice touch. With their comfortable fit, accurate touch controls, and strong call quality, the Liberty 4 NC are one of the easiest wireless earbuds recommendations I can make."

      "text": "\u201cThe B&W Pi8 earbuds are a great upgrade from their predecessors, boasting a refined design, improved comfort, and exceptional sound quality.\u201d\n- Full-body sound\n- Relaxing fit\n- Good touch controls\n- Bluetooth Multipoint\n- Retransmission feature\n- Pricey\n- Lower than average battery life\n- Some sound crackling during calls\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nThe Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 are among the best sets of earbuds I\u2019ve worn.\nFounded in 1966, B&W has released many successful audio products, including speakers, headphones, and, more recently, earbuds. The company\u2019s new Pi8 earbuds go beyond their predecessors \u2014 the Pi7 S2 \u2014 in terms of looks and features. They are strikingly similar in other areas, which isn\u2019t necessarily bad.The PI7 and Pi7 S2 were B&W\u2019s previous top-tier true wireless earbuds. The earlier models were sleek and beautifully designed, with metallic top plates.\nBowers & Wilkins has taken a \u201cless is more\u201d approach with its design for the Pi8, resulting in a sophisticated aesthetic that exudes understated elegance. Gone are the flashy tops, replaced by a refined combination of high-quality matte plastic and subtle metallic accents. This design shift gives them a more timeless appeal.\nThe Pi8\u2019s available color options \u2014 Anthracite Black, Dove White, Jade Green, and Midnight Blue \u2014 further emphasize this refined aesthetic. These muted tones, complemented by delicate accents, perfectly capture the essence of premium simplicity.\nThe redesign extends beyond a new look \u2014 these earbuds are plenty functional, too. Like the Pi7 S2 before it, the Pi8 earbuds incorporate a touch-sensitive multifunction area on the top face of each earbud. However, B&W repositioned the microphones and sensors, tucking them away in a subtle indentation around each earpiece.\nAs someone who finds the standard AirPods uncomfortable and can only tolerate the fit of the AirPods Pro, I wanted to see how they compare to the Pi8. I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional comfort of the Pi8. After hours of rigorous testing in various scenarios \u2014 walking, working, even exercising \u2014 I can confidently say that the Pi8 ranks among the most comfortable earbuds I\u2019ve ever worn.\nThe earbud\u2019s silicone eartips account for a lot of that comfort. Along with those that ship already on the earbuds, the Pi8 comes with three additional sizes of tips, making it more likely that you will find one that gives you a secure fit.\nThe specs\n| Price | $399 |\n| Weight | 0.25 ounces each (charging case 1.62 ounces) |\n| Form factor | Closed earbuds |\n| Noise cancellation | ANC with transparency |\n| Battery life | 6.5 hours with ANC, 20 hours total with charging case |\n| Charging | USB-C, wireless |\n| Voice assistant | Native smartphone access |\n| Multipoint | Yes |\n| Water/dust resistance | IP54 (for earbuds) |\n| Hi-res audio | Yes |\n| Fast pairing | No |\n| Bluetooth/codecs | BT 5.4 with aptX Lossless/Adaptive/Classic, AAC, SBC |\n| Auracast | No |\nBattery life\nEach Pi8 bud offers 6.5 hours of listening time with ANC on a single charge. The wireless charging case can fully recharge the earbuds slightly more than twice, providing a total of 20 hours of playtime. This surpasses the battery life of the Pi7 S2, which offered five hours per charge and 21 hours of total time, but those numbers assumed ANC wasn\u2019t in use.\nThe case isn\u2019t just for charging. It also has an audio retransmission feature, letting you connect the case via a cable to audio sources that lack Bluetooth, effectively transforming wired devices into wireless ones.\nImagine experiencing hi-fi from in-flight entertainment systems, gym equipment, or even newer iPhones without dealing with wires. This feature is so seamless that testing it almost feels unnecessary \u2014 it just works. Connect the two included cables, and the case will handle the rest, effortlessly streaming audio to your Pi8 earbuds.\nThe feature isn\u2019t new \u2014 the PI7 and Pi7 S2 could do this, too. But B&W upped its game with the Pi8 by providing a USB-C cable for digital sources, in addition to the previous 3.5mm cable for analog sources. Plus, the case now transmits using the aptX Adaptive codec, which brings a big bump in quality compared to the PI7\u2019s aptX Low Latency codec.\nFunctionality\nThe capacitive buttons let you control playback and track skipping, plus call accept/reject. However, the B&W Music app for iOS and Android lets you customize the tap-and-hold gesture with your choice of volume up/down or a combo of ANC and access to your phone\u2019s voice assistant.\nUnfortunately, you have to pick. There\u2019s no way to get volume and ANC control at the same time, like you can on other earbuds, such as the AirPods Pro, which can perform all of these tasks without having to customize one of the gestures.\nStill, the Pi8 are an improvement over the previous model. With the Pi7 S2 earbuds, volume control wasn\u2019t an option at all.\nDespite the limitations, the touch controls on the Pi8 earbuds worked very well. I was able to move back and forth between settings with ease. I was especially impressed that even during a run, the earbuds responded precisely as I wanted with a single tap.\nThe B&W Music app lets you turn ANC off entirely (to save a bit of battery life), adjust the EQ (see below), install firmware updates, and more.\nThe Pi8\u2019s best features its sound quality, as it should be. One reason for this is B&W\u2019s Carbon Cone driver, which is debuting on a pair of the company\u2019s earbuds for the first time. This technology is also featured in the company\u2019s Px8 headphones and 700 Series speakers.\nCarbon fiber composite is significantly stiffer and lighter than traditional materials like paper or plastic. The carbon fiber cones are designed to reduce sound distortion and produce more accurate audio reproduction.\nYou will love the way the audio unfolds on these earbuds. I could detect subtle nuances on my favorite tracks and a clear separation between instruments.\nThe Pi8 truly excels in the midrange. The vocals are warm and intimate, capturing the emotion and texture of the notes. Depending on your preference, the bass is deep, but certainly not overpowering.\nCodecs\nThe Pi8 earbuds support high-quality Bluetooth codecs to provide audio. Leading the pack is aptX Adaptive, which many consider the most advanced codec currently available. It adjusts the bit rate on the fly, adapting to your connection quality to deliver audio fidelity and balance.\nYou need a supported device to utilize aptX Adaptive. Unfortunately, neither of my new phones, the iPhone 16 Pro Max or Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, supports aptX Adaptive. Neither do Samsung phones. However, select phones from Motorola, ASUS, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Nothing do.\nTo test aptX Adaptive, I used the case\u2019s retransmission feature and then compared the sound to the same music when listened to through Bluetooth on my iPhone in AAC format.\nIndeed, the sound using aptX Adaptive was slightly more robust than through AAC. It also seemed to have a slightly lower latency, which I noticed the most when playing a game on my MacBook Air.\nOverall, however, I can honestly say the sound I got when using the earbuds were crystal clear, no matter the codec. Others might hear a huge difference, but I did not.\nBesides AAC and aptX Adaptive, the Pi8 earbuds support aptX Lossless, aptX Classic, and SBC.\nThe B&W Music app has a five-band equalizer. This allows minor adjustments across the frequency spectrum, letting you to tailor the sound signature to your preferences or specific music genres.\nYou can customize the tone of your earbuds using the app\u2019s advanced EQ option, which allows you to use sliders to make subtle tweaks. Alternatively, you can set your Pi8 earbuds to \u201cTrue Sound\u201d mode, which delivers the audio as the artist and B&W intended without any tonal customization. I didn\u2019t notice significant changes as I adjusted these settings in various ways. Instead, I used the default \u201cTrue Sound\u201d setting, which B&W offers so everyday audio listeners can enjoy balanced sounds.\nIt should also be noted that the Pi8 do not support spatial audio like other true wireless earbuds, such as the AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4.\nWith the Pi8, there are three available Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) modes: ANC on, Pass-Through, or ANC Off. The ANC on the Pi8 is truly impressive. During my tests, it effectively silenced most environmental noise, creating a peaceful sonic bubble even when I was walking near a somewhat crowded city street. While some low-frequency sounds like truck engines were faintly audible, the Pi8 did an exceptional job of neutralizing the distracting hum of passing cars and other everyday noises.\nB&W\u2019s implementation of Pass-Through, its version of transparency mode, is equally remarkable. Unlike some earbuds that introduce an unnatural \u201csucking\u201d sound when transitioning to transparency, the Pi8 maintains a smooth and natural audio profile. The ambient sound is seamlessly blended with the music, providing just the right awareness of what\u2019s happening around you without compromising audio quality.\nIn use\nFor testing, I tried the Pi8 with various songs to see how well they performed in different scenarios.\nAt the front of the queue was Queen\u2019s Bohemian Rhapsody. This incredible piece of music, with its changing dynamics and rich harmonies, challenged the Pi8s to demonstrate their capabilities. But the earphones managed to navigate the intricacies of the song with elegance. They produced an excellent sound field where Freddie Mercury\u2019s voice stood out amid the detailed musical arrangement. Every guitar melody, piano note, and opera-like climax came through distinctly. I was genuinely amazed by the performance.\nI then headed over to Hotel California with the Eagles. I listened to this rock song to test how well the Pi8s could handle powerful guitar solos, harmonies, and a robust rhythm section. The sound quality was good overall. However, I noticed that the bass didn\u2019t have as much depth as I thought it would.\nDigging deeper into the frequency range, I played Teardrop by Massive Attack. Its captivating bassline and detailed sound arrangement make it a standout in the trip hop genre. The earphones accurately portrayed the song\u2019s layered bass without overpowering or drowning out the other music components. This experience demonstrated the earbuds\u2019 attention to detail and commitment to faithfully reproducing music.\nI decided to switch things up and listen to Miles Davis\u2019 album Kind of Blue next. This iconic jazz piece is known for its dynamics and beautiful harmony among the instruments. Thanks to how well the earphones captured the intimate essence of it all, I could immerse myself in the intricate interplay between the trumpet, saxophone, and piano.\nI turned up the volume one last time with White Stripes\u2018 Seven Nation Army. The catchy bassline and lively vibe of this rock classic put the Pi8 earbuds to the test when it came to handling frequencies. I was impressed by how these earbuds produced a bass performance that was clear and powerful enough to drive the song without making the overall sound muddy or distorted.\nI didn\u2019t have the opportunity to compare the sounds between the Pi8 and Pi7 S2. However, I did compare how well B&W\u2019s earbuds performed against the AirPods Pro 2.\nDuring my brief test, I listened to the same song (Miles Davis\u2019 Freddie Freeloader) on Qobuz via Bluetooth with both earbuds and ANC turned on. The Pi8 earbuds sounded fuller and more punchy than the AirPods, providing a more immersive experience. This surprised me, so I tested again with Billie Eilish\u2019s bad guy, which has a prominent bass line. Once again, there was no comparison. The Pi8 earbuds sounded more robust, hands down.\nI used the voice memo app on my iPhone to test how well the Pi8 earbuds performed when making calls. Doing this, as opposed to making an actual call, gives you a better idea of how good the earbuds are by removing factors like cell connection quality from the equation.\nUnfortunately, I heard some occasional crackling noises, especially when I was outside. Those noises occurred whether I was using ANC or transparency and when neither option was active.\nAlthough the earbuds and the charging case didn\u2019t require it, I charged them to 100% to see if that would improve the call quality. It did, actually, so take that for what it\u2019s worth. During further testing, I didn\u2019t hear anything significant, so go figure.\nBy the way, when making actual calls, my teenage daughter said the sound was nearly perfect with barely any background noise.\nYou can pair your Pi8 earbuds with up to eight devices via Bluetooth, including phones, tablets, smart home devices, computers, smart televisions, and more. The easiest way to do this is through the B&W Music app, which keeps track of all those devices so you don\u2019t have to. Depending on the device, you can also pair the earbuds using your device\u2019s Bluetooth settings.\nWith Bluetooth Multipoint, you can connect to two of these devices simultaneously. This convenient feature automatically switches between devices in certain scenarios. For example, I use multipoint when I\u2019m listening to music on my Mac with my phone nearby. When I receive a call, the earbuds automatically switch to the phone so I can take the call. At that time, the music on the computer automatically pauses. Once the call is completed, the music resumes playing on the computer. It works really well.\nThe bottom line\nThe B&W Pi8 earbuds boast a refined design, great comfort, and exceptional sound quality. Thanks to the innovative Carbon Cone drivers and high-quality Bluetooth codec support, they deliver a truly immersive listening experience, regardless of the type of music you enjoy. While the price is higher than that of many alternatives, the Pi8\u2019s combination of audio excellence, sophisticated aesthetics, and smart features like retransmission and Multipoint make them a compelling choice for those who love music.\nIf I had a magic wand, I would want the Pi8 earbuds to have a longer battery life, more customization options for its capacitive buttons, and to be available in a range of brighter colors.\nHowever, the B&W Pi8 are still among the best wireless earbuds on the market."

      "text": "Apple\u2019s AirPods have well and truly embedded themselves into popular culture in the nine years they\u2019ve been blessing the ears of Apple fans. You\u2019ll spy the iconic wireless earbuds nuzzled into lugholes pretty much everywhere \u2013 on trains and planes, on your TV screen and the silver one. It\u2019s hardly surprising that they are the world\u2019s most popular earbuds.\nThe flagship AirPods model remains the AirPods Pro 2 launched three years ago, and while Apple did lightly update them in 2023 with a USB-C port, IP55 rating and lossless audio support with the Vision Pro, the ripe old age of their design elsewhere does beg the question: where are the AirPods Pro 3?\nIndeed, in recent months rumors of new AirPods Pros arriving have been circling the internet with the fervor of sharks circling their next meal, and, excitingly for AirPods enthusiasts (including us!), the signs are pointing to a launch later this year or early next \u2013 and potentially as soon as September.\nSo what can we expect from the next-gen AirPods Pro and what features make our wishlist? We\u2019ve rounded up all the latest AirPods Pro 3 leaks and rumors below\u2026\nLatest AirPods Pro 3 news\n- The AirPods Pro 3 could feature\u2026 cameras? A new feature in iOS 26, spotted by 9to5Mac, suggests there will be some camera smarts built into upcoming AirPods, likely to facilitate real-time hand gesture tracking.\n- Real-time translation could come to the new AirPods Apple is late to the live translation game, but according to Bloomberg it could arrive as part of the anticipated iOS19 update, allowing iPhone and AirPods users to overcome language barriers and easily hold conversations.\nWhen is the AirPods Pro 3\u2019s expected release date?\nThe early running from some tipsters suggested that the new AirPods could launch during June\u2019s WWDC 2025, potentially alongside an upgraded AirTag, but nothing materialized. Boo. If that had happened, then Apple might have been using the occasion to launch a software interface to allow third parties to offer new functionality for the headphones.\nHowever, Apple has historically kept all of the AirPods Pro\u2019s functionality tightly controlled and only managed via settings within its own software. Assuming this trend continues, a September announcement alongside that of iPhone 17 seems more likely.\nThis would align with the typical cycle of AirPods, which tend to get refreshed every two to three years. For example, the AirPods 4 were announced in September 2024, three years after the previous-gen AirPods 3 were released. As the gap between the first and second generation of the AirPods Pro was three years (first in 2019, then in 2022), a 2025 arrival would be fit. That said, two respected analysts and Apple watchers, Ming Chi-Kuo and Jeff Pu, recently suggested that the AirPods Pro 3 may not show up until 2026.\nHowever, not all is lost for a 2025 AirPods Pro 3 release date. References to the AirPods Pro 3 found in the iPhone\u2019s iOS 26 operating system source code suggests Apple\u2019s new earbuds could make their way into our ears this year. It\u2019s feasible that 2026 is still a possibility, as this is the software that will be used into early 2026, but that seems a little unlikely.\nAssuming that Apple does indeed announce the AirPods Pro 3 in the fall along with the next iPhone, history tells us that we can expect them to be available for pre-order within hours of the announcement. They\u2019ll likely start shipping 10-14 days after that.\nHow much will the AirPods Pro 3 cost?\nApple has announced all three previous AirPods Pro versions (the originals, second-gen, and USB-C update) at a regular price of $249.\nThere are, of course, no guarantees in the tech world \u2013 especially in the current economic climate of tit-for-tat tariffs \u2013 but it\u2019s a reasonable guess that the company will maintain this price for the AirPods Pro 3.\nA $249 RRP would keep them firmly at the top of the AirPods line, above the often-discounted-to-$169 AirPods Pro 2 (which will most likely be discontinued in the wake of the Pro 3\u2019s arrival), the $179 AirPods 4 with ANC and the $129 AirPods 4.\nAirPods Pro 3: What the rumors say\nSpeculation among aforementioned Apple-watching analysts, plus notable journalist Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, has centered around one key AirPods Pro 3 area: sensors.\nThe prevailing belief is that Apple will incorporate a new sensor suite capable of tracking temperature and heart rate at a minimum. Apple filed a patent for this in 2017 and, given that the Apple-owned Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 have heart rate sensors, it seems like a fairly safe bet. Speaking of health functions, it\u2019s also highly likely that the Pro 3 will continue the Pro 2\u2019s innovative double-up as an over-the-counter hearing aid, with the hearing test also embedded.\nHowever, one of the wilder rumors suggests that the AirPods Pro 3 could also get some kind of embedded camera. Not so much for taking photos and video (though that would be intriguing) but instead for real-time hand-gesture tracking, perhaps as an alternative to using the earbuds\u2019 onboard controls, or as an alternative to using Siri for controlling functions on an iPhone. This rumor feels less likely \u2013 at least for the third-gen AirPods Pro. After all, making a camera so tiny that it can fit into an earbud brings issues with it \u2013 power consumption, heat dissipation, miniscule and costly components, not to mention privacy.\nOther rumors point to an Apple patent that detailed a design for a charging case with a built-in touchscreen as a sign of what\u2019s to come on the AirPods Pro 3.\nCould Apple do it? Certainly. JBL has already added this feature to several wireless earbuds models, including the Tour Pro 3.\nWill Apple do it? It\u2019s hard to see why, given it\u2019s not done something like that before and would come at a cost to battery life \u2013 which it should really improve in the next generation of the Pro earbuds.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 deliver a six-hour earbud and 30-hour total battery life, but plenty of the best wireless earbuds in the premium market offer better earbud battery lives of eight hours or more, including the Sony WF-1000XM5.\nAlso, the AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 with ANC boasted one of the smallest charging cases on the market, and small cases and touchscreens are somewhat mutually exclusive. If Apple wants to shrink the AirPods Pro 3 case too, then, an integrated display is a lot less likely.\nIt\u2019s also unclear if people actually find JBL\u2019s touchscreen useful, despite the many functions it lets you access \u2013 Apple\u2019s unlikely to play with gimmicks here. The biggest reason for a touchscreen charging case is to reduce the need to use your phone. Since there are only a few scenarios where people use earbuds without their phones, Apple may not see the benefit.\nSpeaking of the charging case, it\u2019s almost a given that the AirPods Pro 3 will ditch the physical Bluetooth pairing button in favor of the capacitive touch version used on the AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 with ANC. It\u2019s also highly probable it will support wireless charging, and there has been some speculation over whether Apple would ditch wired charging via the USB-C port altogether, but it\u2019s probably unlikely for this next generation.\nFinally, most observers agree that we can expect better sound quality and further improvements to Apple\u2019s already superb active noise canceling and transparency technologies, with \u201cpreviously-accurate\u201d (according to MacRumors) leaker Kosutami claiming on X that their Digital ANC will be \u201cmuch better\u201d than that of the AirPods Pro 2.\nConsidering how excellent the AirPods Pro 2 remain in both of these fields, we could be in for a real best-in-class treat here from Apple. Watch out, Bose and Sony!\nWhat we\u2019re hoping for on the AirPods Pro 3\nAdditional sensors on the AirPods Pro 3 make sense. Apple is already all-in on health and fitness via the Apple Watch, and having additional health data via the AirPods will make that tracking more accurate and useful.\nAs mentioned previously, battery life is also high on my wishlist. Sure, the current six hours in the Pro 2 earbuds is adequate, but we know from other companies that it can be much longer \u2013 and who ever said \u201cno thanks\u201d to longer battery life?\nHowever, I\u2019m also looking for improvements to the AirPods Pro\u2019s original wireless music mission.\nI want to see Apple adopt true Bluetooth Multipoint. At the moment, you can switch quite easily between your Apple products thanks to iCloud, but if you happen to use a Windows laptop for work, there is no way to keep the AirPods Pro connected to your iPhone and your computer simultaneously. It\u2019s high time Apple joined the Multipoint world along with pretty much every other recent, notable wireless earbuds release \u2013 at this point, the AirPods family is one of few product lines that doesn\u2019t support this handy technology.\nIn a similar vein, I want Apple to futureproof the AirPods Pro 3 with access to Bluetooth Auracast broadcasts. This would allow the Pro 3 to tune into publicly shared audio channels (such as audio from multiple TV screens at an airport) when the feature finally takes off. It could choose to do this within iOS and/or on the earbuds themselves.\nApple teased us when it said the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C could do wireless lossless audio. It wasn\u2019t a lie, but it came with a monster caveat: it only works with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro AR headset. I want Apple to move forward with this feature so that (at least) it works with iPhones. If there\u2019s a sound quality benefit to lossless audio (which many music fans would agree with), it shouldn\u2019t be reserved for the Vision Pro \u2013 not least when Apple Music has, for years now, delivered hi-res audio streaming.\nIn similar vein, improved sound quality feels like a must. The Pro 2 still hold their own amongst the current competition, but given that the class-leading Sony WF-1000XM5 (which sit pretty at the top of our best wireless earbuds buying guide) are due a refresh soon, the Pro 3 could find themselves lagging behind if they fail to move the Pro 2\u2019s audio chops along.\nIt feels almost certain that Apple will launch the AirPods Pro 3 with an all-new chipset \u2013 likely called the H3, given the first AirPods debuted the H1, and the Pro 2 launched the H2. This upgraded chip would give Apple the chance to improve audio quality and ANC, power enhanced health tracking features, and extend battery life.\nFinally, Apple could also give us the option of plugging the AirPods Pro 3 charging case into a 3.5mm-toting, Bluetooth-less analog audio source like a plane in-flight entertainment system, and use the charging case as a wireless transmitter to send audio to the earbuds.\nThis wouldn\u2019t be an innovation. Bowers & Wilkins, LG, JBL and Jabra all provide this feature on current and previous wireless earbuds.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 charging case already contains an ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless transmitter for the Find My feature, and UWB would make an excellent choice for wireless transmission to the AirPods."

      "text": "Sony WF-1000XM6 rears its head in new leak with launch seemingly on track for late 2025\nThe Walkman Blog has discovered new references to the WF-1000XM6, just over two weeks after it previously posted about Sony's next pair of high-end wireless earbuds. Incidentally, the new disclosure arrives in the wake of a mysterious new pair of Sony over-ear wireless headphones surfacing, as well as major new updates for the existing WH-1000XM6 and WF-1000XM5 (curr. $149.99 - refurbished on Amazon).\nNow, the website has revealed new import filings that shed more light on the WF-1000XM6. According to The Walkman Blog, their previous leak originated in mid-March or about two months before the date of the latest import filing it has now posted. Given that the WH-1000XM6 experienced similar leaks a few months before its eventual launch, it seems that the WF-1000XM6 is on track for an official release before the end of the year.\nThe latest batch of leaks indicate that Sony had started shipping Engineering Validation Test (EVT) prototypes for further testing by May. In other words, we are likely only a few months away from seeing more substantive leaks courtesy of Design Validation Test (DVT) prototypes that Sony will submit to regulatory bodies like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US.\nIt is worth stressing that Sony will then move to Production Validation Test (PVT) units before mass producing initial WF-1000XM6 batches. Nonetheless, current leaks suggest that Sony intends to offer the WF-1000XM6 in smaller packaging than its predecessor. While this packaging is set to measure 84 x 70 x 55 mm, this does not necessarily mean that Sony will shrink the size of its WF-1000X earbuds between generations."

      "text": "- Excellent comfort and fit\n- Great sound quality\n- Much improved noise cancellation\n- Bluetooth Multipoint\n- No side-tone for calls\n- Limited phone support for aptX Lossless\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nSennheiser has long been a favorite of the audiophile community and is a brand most associated with outstanding headphone audio quality. So perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that the latest generation of the company\u2019s wireless earbuds \u2014 the Momentum True Wireless 4 \u2014 have casually sidestepped the whole head-tracking spatial audio trend. While spatial audio might have a growing audience (in no small part due to Apple\u2019s fiery promotional efforts), audio purists remain more interested in good ol\u2019 stereo and how they can get higher-quality sound over a Bluetooth connection.\nKnowing that, Sennheiser\u2019s formula for the $300 Momentum True Wireless 4 is simple: improve everything and get ready for what\u2019s next.\nAfter an all-too-brief chance to try these earbuds, I think it\u2019s a winning formula, indeed.\nWhat\u2019s changed?\nFor brevity, I\u2019ll refer to the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 (and their predecessors, the Momentum True Wireless 3) as the MTW4 and MTW3, respectively. Here\u2019s what Sennheiser has added \u2014 and perhaps why the new model costs $20 more.\n- Battery life is now 7.5 hours per charge with 30 hours total versus 7/28, and a new battery management system promises a longer overall operating life\n- Bluetooth Multipoint is now supported out of the box. (It was added to the MTW3 with a firmware update)\n- Class 1 Bluetooth 5.4 with LE Audio and Auracast support coming via a firmware update\n- Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Sound platform, along with its signature feature, lossless audio over Bluetooth, is available for Android phones that also support Snapdragon Sound\n- Active noise cancellation (ANC) and transparency modes have been improved\n- A new AI voice processing algorithm should help with call quality\n- Sennheiser\u2019s app has a new sound personalization feature\n- A new IP54 rating adds dust resistance to the existing water resistance of the earbuds\nWhat hasn\u2019t changed?\nAll the improvements listed above are largely software and chipset-led changes. The earbud drivers \u2014 arguably one of the biggest factors in sound quality \u2014 remain the same 7mm TrueResponse dynamic units Sennheiser has been using for several years.\nOn the outside, the MTW4 are identical to their predecessors, save for three color choices. The white and silver models now have metallic-look endcaps, and a slick new copper-black option replaces the graphite variant.\nThe earbuds\u2019 shape has been preserved. So, if the MTW3 provided you with a good fit, you can expect the same from the MTW4. For me, it\u2019s an excellent match for my ears. The MTW3 changed my opinion of Sennheiser\u2019s earbuds from a comfort and fit point of view, so I\u2019m delighted to see nothing\u2019s been altered on that front.\nThe same goes for the charging case. It\u2019s still wrapped in a soft but durable fabric, has excellent lid and hinge operation, and still supports wireless and USB-C wired charging. The only negative is that it\u2019s still bulky, boxy, and nearly twice as thick as the Apple AirPods Pro.\nSennheiser once again includes a charging cable, four sizes of silicone eartips, and three sizes of earfin stability bands. A fit test in the Sennheiser Smart Control app helps ensure the best seal possible.\nTouch controls done right\nI maintain that physical controls are preferable to touch controls. They have a tactile quality that can\u2019t be beaten, and you can usually use them with gloved hands. Still, Sennheiser\u2019s touch controls are some of the best in the business.\nThe entire outer shell of the earbuds is touch-sensitive, and you get an audible confirmation for each successfully recognized tap. They\u2019re also extremely customizable within the Smart Control app. So, if you don\u2019t like the default gestures and functions, they can be changed.\nAugmenting the usual play/pause function are wear sensors on the earbuds that can auto-pause and resume your music when you remove one or both earbuds. Auto-pause takes a second to kick in, while the resume function happens instantly.\nBetter Bluetooth\nBluetooth Multipoint is a must these days as most of us spend ever-increasing amounts of time on multiple devices, and the MTW4 do it well. You can connect to any two devices simultaneously, and switching between them is seamless. The Smart Control app lets you see all of the devices you\u2019ve previously paired with, which makes picking those two connections dead simple.\nFor the MTW4, Sennheiser has upped the Bluetooth version to 5.4 and says it will add support for LE Audio and Auracast via a firmware update. Both features are worth having, but both are very much forward-looking. LE Audio \u2014 via the new LC3 codec \u2014 promises lower latency, lower energy, and higher-quality audio compared to both the AAC and SBC codecs. Not many phones support it yet, but you\u2019ll be ready when they do.\nAuracast, in my opinion, is more interesting. It lets folks share their Bluetooth audio with an unlimited number of other listeners, and it creates the first standard for Bluetooth broadcasting in public spaces like airports or conferences. Auracast went from theory to practice at CES 2024, but it may still be a year or two before you start to see it proliferate. Still, you\u2019ll be ready when it does.\nMy one note on the MTW4\u2019s Bluetooth performance is that it seems to have a shorter wireless range than other earbuds in its class. As I moved between the floors of my house, I couldn\u2019t get very far without the connection from my iPhone breaking up. The Apple AirPods Pro, by contrast, can roam anywhere without issue. At one point, when I was at the gym, the MTW4 lost their connection to the phone for almost 40 seconds before reconnecting. I can see this being a firmware issue. Increasingly, I\u2019ve been receiving review devices that are still being actively improved. I\u2019ll update this review if things change.\nGo lossless \u2014 if you can\nThere are still precious few Android phones that support aptX Lossless through Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Sound platform. In fact, I had to borrow a Motorola ThinkPhone because it\u2019s one of the few handsets that do. But if you own one of the phones or plan to buy one, the Sennheiser MTW4 can deliver bit-perfect, CD-quality audio. Or, at least, that\u2019s the claim.\nI have no way to verify it, and I suspect nothing less than root-level access to the earbuds\u2019 onboard digital-to-analog converter (DAC) would let you do so. For me, purely based on my ability to discern differences in quality, the jury\u2019s still out on whether aptX Lossless is better than aptX Adaptive, a lossy yet hi-res audio codec that is supported on a much wider range of phones.\nOne thing\u2019s for certain: both are markedly better than AAC (the default codec on iPhones) or SBC (the default codec for all Bluetooth audio).\nWhy should you even care about lossless? Honestly, if you\u2019re a Spotify listener, it doesn\u2019t matter much since that service doesn\u2019t (yet) let you stream lossless audio.\nBut if you\u2019ve chosen a streaming music service like Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, or Qobuz because you want lossless, CD-quality audio (at a minimum), aptX Lossless is your best bet for preserving that extra sound quality.\nCodec control\nWhat\u2019s unusual about Sennheiser\u2019s approach to these codecs is that it gives you some say over which one you want to use. Usually, when a set of earbuds connects to a phone, the two devices swap info regarding which codecs they have in common and then default to the one with the highest quality.\nUsing the Smart Control app, however, you can choose between four audio resolution settings: standard, low latency, high-resolution, and lossless \u2014 each with its own specific flavor of aptX.\nOn an iPhone, these settings are essentially ignored. Regardless of which one you pick, you\u2019ll always use the AAC codec because that\u2019s all Apple supports.\nBut even on Android phones, these options represent a desired state \u2014 not a guaranteed state.\nFor instance, if your phone supports aptX Lossless and you choose the lossless setting, the MTW4 will attempt to connect using aptX Lossless. If your phone supports aptX Adaptive but not aptX Lossless, you\u2019ll get Adaptive at the highest sampling rate your device can manage. Finally, if your phone only works with the aptX codecs that ship with Android (aptX/aptX HD), you\u2019ll get aptX.\nThe caveat with any Bluetooth codec is that it\u2019s all dependent on the quality of your Bluetooth link. A poor Bluetooth connection will force a scaling back of audio quality, irrespective of which setting you select in the app.\nSounds like Sennheiser\nPopping the MTW4 straight out of the box into your ears provides the kind of clear and balanced sound signature that Sennheiser is known for. Bass response is punchy without being overwhelming, and the mids have plenty of detail.\nHowever, as soon as I swapped them for the Sony WF-1000XM5, the MTW4 felt pale and somewhat two-dimensional by comparison. That\u2019s when I tried the new My Sound personalization feature in the Smart Control app. What a difference.\nThe My Sound process steps you through two balancing exercises, where you\u2019re asked to find the mix of strings and bass that sounds right to you. The third step introduces drums to the mix, and in the last step, you\u2019re given a square grid-like space and a moveable blue disc to fine-tune the EQ.\nOnce I\u2019d found my preferred setting, the MTW4 came alive.\nDefinitely take time to customize the sound.\nAs I get older, I find I\u2019m not as sensitive to higher frequencies. Normally I\u2019d spend time messing around with the included five-band equalizer to get the 6kHz boost that helps with this, but the My Sound personalization accomplished the same thing and it was fun using its fine-tune step.\nThe result was still less immersive than the XM5 and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, both of which have wider soundstages. That\u2019s less of a criticism than it sounds \u2014 not everyone likes the way Sony and Bose process audio. Some folks find those earbuds to be boosted in all the wrong ways. Sennheiser\u2019s more conservative approach will be appreciated by these listeners.\nSennheiser\u2019s best noise cancellation and transparency\nBose, Sony, and Apple are locked in a three-way battle for the supremacy of silence, with each new generation of wireless products upping the ante yet again. The reason they\u2019re the companies to beat is that each has developed proprietary ANC technology.\nThis puts Sennheiser at a disadvantage, and yet the MTW4 are nonetheless a significant improvement over the third-gen earbuds in both ANC and transparency. And unless you demand nothing less than the best, I think they provide more than enough ability to quiet annoying background noise.\nPerhaps more impressive is the speed with which they can switch from ANC to transparency \u2014 a single tap on the left earbud (by default), and you\u2019re in a whole new world.\nAnd I\u2019m very appreciative of the option that lets you pause music when you switch to transparency. It should be available on every ANC-capable product.\nMy only note on the MTW4 is that the ANC mode introduces a slight but noticeable hiss. It gets erased the moment you start listening to music, but if you\u2019re hoping to use the feature on its own, you may find it distracting.\nGreat calls for your contacts\nAnother area that sees a meaningful improvement over the MTW3 is call quality. I wasn\u2019t especially impressed by the third-gen\u2019s ability to manage background noise. It tended to produce bad bouts of wobble and compression. The MTW4 are far more deft at extracting your voice from these other sounds. While not perfect, they\u2019re never going to leave your callers constantly demanding that you repeat yourself.\nHowever, I\u2019m not happy that Sennheiser continues to treat side-tone (hearing your voice on calls) as unnecessary. For me, the thing that can make video and voice calls exhausting is my inability to hear my voice naturally. It\u2019s why I much prefer using open-ear earbuds for these tasks.\nIt\u2019s hard to find another set of wireless earbuds that do not offer side-tone, and yet it remains absent on the MTW4. Sennheiser, if you\u2019re listening, please fix this.\nA better battery\nSennheiser says you\u2019ll now get up to 7.5 hours per charge with 30 hours total when you include the charging case. That\u2019s assuming 50% volume. Using ANC only knocks these numbers down to seven and 28, respectively. You can get an extra hour of playtime with just eight minutes of charging. That\u2019s probably more than enough for most uses.\nI\u2019ll be honest: three days of testing isn\u2019t enough time to get a sense of whether Sennheiser\u2019s claims for the MTW4\u2019s battery life are accurate. However, the time I did log with these earbuds reduced their battery percentage readouts in the Sennheiser app proportionally to those claims, so consider this a provisional pass.\nThe Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 may lack some of the bells and whistles found on other high-end earbuds, especially when it comes to spatial audio. But when it comes to the core features that matter most on a set of $300 earbuds \u2014 comfort, sound quality, noise cancellation, transparency, call quality, and battery life \u2014 they can more than hold their own."

Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nSony\u2019s $180 LinkBuds amazed and perplexed me. Their original premise \u2014 that it should be possible to enjoy high-quality sound while also maintaining a barrier-free connection to the outside world \u2014 was intriguing. Same for their donut-shaped speakers. And despite a few drawbacks, they largely worked.\nBut the LinkBuds certainly aren\u2019t for everyone. Now, Sony has introduced the $200 LinkBuds S, with a totally different wireless earbud design from the Buy at Amazon . The company says its target audience is the same as the original LinkBuds \u2014 those who like to spend their days connected to their digital and real worlds, moving seamlessly between them. \u201cAlways on, never off,\u201d is the LinkBuds\u2019 family catchphrase.\nWithout the open design of the first LinkBuds, it\u2019s hard to see how that works. But with a light and small shape, features like speak-to-chat, the as-yet-unreleased \u201cAuto Play,\u201d and wireless hi-res audio, Sony definitely feels the LinkBuds S offer something new, that no other earbuds can match at any price. But is it something that you\u2019ll want? Let\u2019s take a look.\nAbout that box\nInside the box, you\u2019ll find the LinkBuds S already in their charging case, four sets of silicone eartips in total (mediums are installed by default), and a very short, 7.8-inch USB-A-to-USB-C charging cable. But it\u2019s the box itself that deserves special praise: It\u2019s made of partially recycled (and fully recyclable) cardboard and paper, without a hint of plastic anywhere.\nIt\u2019s easily the most eco-friendly packaging in the industry, and we hope the other players take note \u2014 I\u2019m sure this is one innovation Sony won\u2019t mind if its competitors imitate.\nDesign\nTaking cues from its siblings, the $99 Sony WF-C500 and $280 WF-1000XM4, the LinkBuds S are smaller than both of those models, with an understated, matte-textured finish in black (technically a two-tone black/gray), white, or a Best Buy-exclusive sandy color called ecru. That texture, which adorns the charging case too, makes the buds easy to grip, but it isn\u2019t so rough that it\u2019s uncomfortable.\nThey\u2019re so small, they\u2019re one of the few models of wireless earbuds that I can wear under a motorcycle helmet because they barely protrude from my ears. Like the XM4, the entire outer surfaces act as touch controls, while a small, circular windscreen conceals the LinkBuds S mics.\nThe charging case also is very compact, and while I didn\u2019t intentionally try to damage it, I suspect that the textured finish will hold up well in the inevitable collision with keys and other objects in your pocket or purse. The lid and hinge work smoothly, with none of the floppiness that cheaper units sometimes suffer from, and the magnetic closure has just the right amount of pull.\nThese are easily the most comfortable Sony buds I\u2019ve worn so far.\nA slender LED strip along the front lets you know its charging state. The only thing missing here is wireless charging \u2014 a surprise given that most charging cases at this price now have this feature.\nAs with all of Sony\u2019s current generation of wireless earbuds, the LinkBuds S have an IPX4 rating for water and sweat resistance, so they should have no trouble with a run or gym workout as long as you clean them afterward.\nComfort, controls, and connections\nThe LinkBuds S are both small and very light. And compared to the WF-1000XM4 they\u2019re downright puny. That sounds like an obvious recipe for great comfort, and it is. These are easily the most comfortable Sony buds I\u2019ve worn so far. But that feeling of comfort didn\u2019t survive the fit test that Sony includes in its Headphones mobile app.\nAfter trying a variety of ear tip sizes, something the test encourages and makes very easy, I found the only way I could get the test to give me a passing grade on the left side was to wedge the LinkBuds S further into my ears than was comfortable. There\u2019s a reason Sony offers the fit test: Getting a good seal is absolutely essential for maximum sound quality, noise canceling, and transparency features. But not at the expense of an uncomfortable fit. Bottom line, try all of the ear tips, but don\u2019t go crazy if the test doesn\u2019t pass you \u2014 as I\u2019ll discuss later, it didn\u2019t seem to compromise my experience at all.\nSony\u2019s touch controls are very good and provide a helpful tone to let you know when you\u2019ve tapped successfully. Doing so is relatively easy, but the upper half of the outer surface was much more sensitive to taps. Touching the bottom portion seldom worked.\nThe LinkBuds S give you single-, double-, and triple-tap gestures to work with as well as tap-and-holds. Between the two earbuds, that\u2019s a total of eight possible actions, but Sony continues to use a control customization scheme that prevents you from selecting the specific functions you want. Instead, you must choose from one of four control \u201cgroups\u201d and you can assign only one group to each earbud. Your choices are: Ambient sound control/quick access, playback control, volume control, or no action.\nConnecting the LinkBuds S is fast and easy, and the link proved very reliable.\nThis creates an unfortunate situation where you must choose what matters most. Want to control volume and playback? Sure thing, but you won\u2019t be able to control ANC, transparency, or get access to features like Spotify Tap. Want playback and ANC? No problem, but you\u2019ll have to control the volume with your phone.\nSony\u2019s not the only company that does this. Others, like JBL, use the same scheme and it drives me just as crazy. And it\u2019s not like there\u2019s some unwritten rule that says this is how earbuds must work. Jabra, for instance, lets you assign virtually any action to any gesture, on either earbud. Sennheiser is also much more flexible with its controls.\nYou can remove an earbud at any time and the wear sensors will automatically pause your tunes. It works very quickly, but you can disable it in the app if you like.\nThanks to support for Google Fast Pair and Microsoft Swift Pair, connecting the LinkBuds S is fast and easy, and the link proved very reliable the entire time I was testing them, even with the LDAC codec enabled \u2014 something that can affect connection stability. Getting them set up on iOS, while not quite as convenient, was also effortless.\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that, like Sony\u2019s other wireless earbuds, the LinkBuds S do not support Bluetooth Multipoint for simultaneous device connections, even when LDAC isn\u2019t in use. Given Sony\u2019s philosophy for the LinkBuds of \u201calways on/never off\u201d this is an especially odd omission. Another limitation: You can use the right earbud on its own for music or calls, but if you choose to use advanced features like Spotify Tap, the left earbud won\u2019t be able to operate independently.\nSound quality\nSony has found a very pleasing sound formula for the LinkBuds S. Without going anywhere near the included EQ adjustments in the Headphones app, the factory tuning is very close to neutral, with a nice balance of frequencies, and a midrange that is more detailed than I was expecting. And it has managed to do this using dynamic drivers that are just 5mm \u2014 half the size of what you\u2019ll find in similar products.\nI noticed the same thing when reviewing Sony\u2019s newest top-of-the-line noise-canceling headphones, the WH-1000XM5: The company has dialed back the boost, especially in the low-end bass. Which is not to say these buds can\u2019t thump \u2014 they can. But you may need to reach into the settings and max out the Clear Bass option in the EQ control panel if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. Clarity across the spectrum is good, but the highs don\u2019t ring quite as crystal clear as you\u2019ll find on the Jabra Elite 7 Pro, or the 1More Evo. Here, too, judicious tweaking of the EQ can help the vocals soar just a bit more.\nThe soundstage, while not especially wide or deep, is precise, and there\u2019s good separation of instruments.\nIt\u2019s the best ANC you\u2019ll find for this price in a set of wireless earbuds.\nMy only disappointment is with the LDAC codec \u2014 that special ingredient that lets Sony claim wireless hi-res audio compatibility for the LinkBuds S. In doing A/B comparisons between the same 24-bit lossless versions of tracks on Amazon Music on both an iPhone 11 using AAC, with DSEE Extreme turned on, and on a Xiaomi 12 Pro using LDAC, the difference was so minute, I\u2019m not sure I can even claim to have heard it.\nPerhaps that\u2019s simply a testament as to how good Sony\u2019s DSEE upscaling technology works, but I feel like other LDAC-enabled earbuds, like the Technics EAH-AZ60 and 1More Evo offered a greater improvement when using this codec.\nNoise cancellation and transparency\nActive noise cancellation (ANC) is one of Sony\u2019s core strengths in the personal audio world, and the LinkBuds S do a very good job of showcasing that competence. Sitting in my home office, which is unfortunately located right beside a bathroom, I\u2019m perpetually jumping up from my chair to shut off the noisy extractor fan. With the LinkBuds S, there\u2019s no need. In fact, I can\u2019t even tell that the fan is running.\nThat same performance will keep noisy traffic sounds at bay, and you\u2019ll even be able to walk past heavy machinery without reaching for your volume settings. Wind noise didn\u2019t even register as I was out one blustery morning. And under my motorcycle helmet, it reduced the very loud wind and engine noise down to a low rumble. It\u2019s the best ANC you\u2019ll find for this price in a set of wireless earbuds.\nTransparency also is excellent. Not quite the \u201cinvisible\u201d level of transparency you\u2019ll get from the AirPods Pro, but I think it\u2019s just as good as the WF-1000XM4. But what makes transparency mode on the LinkBuds S is the incredible level of control you get, thanks to additional settings in the Headphones app.\nSpeak-to-chat, which Sony has cloned from the WF-1000XM4, uses sensors to detect when you\u2019re speaking and automatically engages transparency mode while simultaneously muting your audio. It\u2019s a great convenience \u2014 especially when your hands are full \u2014 and it works really well, though on a few occasions it mistook gear changes on my bike for speech. Sony says some vibrations will cause this kind of false positive.\nYou can also use the quick-attention function by tapping and holding whichever earbud you\u2019ve assigned to ANC functions. Sony adapted this from its wireless headphones, but it doesn\u2019t react quite as quickly on the LinkBuds S.\nCall quality\nThe LinkBuds S perform well under relatively quiet conditions, but like most wireless earbuds, they can become a bit uneven when background noises increase. Not that your callers will hear much of that disturbance. To them, the only sign that you\u2019re in a loud location will be the wobble and compression that happens to your voice.\nCuriously, the original LinkBuds have slightly clearer call quality, possibly because their processors and mics don\u2019t have to do the double-duty of providing ANC and ENC (the noise cancellation performed when on a call) at the same time.\nBattery life\nStrangely, for a set of earbuds that purport to be an all-day, always-on, never-off companion, the LinkBuds S only have average battery life, if that. Sony claims you\u2019ll get six hours per charge with ANC turned on, and nine hours when both ANC and transparency are off. With ANC on, you\u2019ll get 20 hours total when you include the charging case. That\u2019s certainly enough for an entire day (unless you only sleep four hours per night), but not much more.\nBut be warned: Those numbers can drop precipitously when you use some of the extra features. For instance, I found that I only got about 3.5 hours of use with ANC, speak-to-chat, and Alexa with voice activation enabled. But that was with an iPhone using AAC and DSEE Extreme. If I had been using LDAC on top of those other features, I expect it would have been closer to 2.5 hours or less.\nA five-minute quick charge will give you an extra hour of play time if you need it.\nExtras\nSony has packed the LinkBuds S with a huge set of features, some of which I didn\u2019t have time to test, and others that simply weren\u2019t ready to use because they were still under development. Here\u2019s what you can expect:\n- Spotify Tap: If you have the Spotify app installed and open on your phone you can choose to use a double- or triple-tap gesture to resume a previously started playlist, or repeat the gesture to get a new song recommendation.\n- Endel Quick Access: Like Spotify Tap, if you have the Endel meditation app, you can start a personalized soundscape for relaxation, sleep, or increased focus.\n- Wake word access to assistants: You can trigger Alexa or Google Assistant (Android) just by saying \u201cHey Google,\u201d or \u201cAlexa,\u201d \u2014 on iOS, you can only choose Alexa.\n- Spatial audio for AR: Sony intends for people to use the LinkBuds S with AR games like Niantic\u2019s Ingress. When playing, you\u2019ll be able to experience sound cues that are tied to physical locations, so even as you move your head, those sounds will always appear to be coming from the same place.\n- Auto Play: You can install yet another app called Auto Play that will let you assign your favorite playlists from Spotify and other streaming music services to specific actions, like ending a call, or putting the earbuds in your ears. The app will also let audio notifications be read aloud over your music, without pausing.\n- Bluetooth LE Audio: Sony says that the LinkBuds S will be compatible with the new Bluetooth LE Audio standard, which, among other things, promises to reduce latency dramatically, which gamers \u2014 perhaps those playing Ingress \u2014 will appreciate.\nOur take\nThe LinkBuds S are small, light, and get a lot of things right, like sound quality and ANC. But their greatest strength is an ability to intelligently let you go about your day without reaching for the controls, through voice-activated assistants and transparency mode. But with hi-res audio that doesn\u2019t sound noticeably different from regular wireless connections, battery life that\u2019s on the short side, and no wireless charging or Bluetooth Multipoint, it\u2019s not clear whether their strengths are enough to warrant buying them over the many other great earbuds at or near this price.\nAre there better alternatives?\nMost people who are looking for noise-canceling wireless earbuds will be happier overall with the $200 Buy at Amazon . Their sound quality is nearly identical, despite lacking LDAC, and they\u2019re champs for voice calls. Sony\u2019s ANC is better, but the Elite 7 Pro are no slouches in this department either. The Jabras have better battery life, better protection from dust and water, and their charging case supports wireless charging. They have Bluetooth Multipoint, too, which is a huge convenience when using two devices like a phone and a computer.\nIf sound quality and noise cancellation are your two main priorities, it\u2019s worth spending another $30 on the excellent Buy at Walmart.com , which excel in both categories.\nHow long will they last?\nSony\u2019s products are very well built, and that includes the LinkBuds S. With IPX4 protection, they should survive most workouts, and Sony backs them with a standard one-year warranty.\nShould you buy them?\nYes, but only if you think the LinkBuds S\u2019 specific features answer a need(s) you have, that other products simply can\u2019t match. But otherwise, I think there are better choices."

      "text": "For many of us, wireless earbuds have become an essential part of our daily lives, allowing us to listen to music and podcasts and take voice calls cable-free, for hours on end, with something that can connect to our smartphones in seconds and fit discretely into our ears (and, when not in use, easily into our pockets). It's little wonder these compact in-ear headphones are immensely popular.\nNaturally, since Apple's AirPods showed up almost a decade ago and paved the way for wireless earbuds as we know them today, the category has become one of the most competitive in consumer technology. They now offer increasingly high-quality sound, active noise cancellation (ANC) technology, day-long battery lives, dust- and water-resistant designs, and the ability to simultaneously connect to multiple devices for work and play - and they can be picked up for less than $50, or 10 times that.\nSo if you want to bag a new pair, where on earth should you start? We're here to help. This buying guide features only the very best wireless earbuds, ranging from affordable to premium picks, and also highlighting models that are particularly great for Apple users, sport and exercise, sleeping, and those who prioritise noise-canceling performance. Each has been thoroughly tried and tested by our expert reviews team and ticks all the boxes when it comes to performance, features and comfort.\nCurrently, it\u2019s hard to find a better all-round pair of wireless earbuds than Sony's latest flagship model, the WF-1000XM5. Sony has consistently excelled in this top-line series, which has topped our list for years, and it could go one better before long with the highly rumored and anticipated Sony WF-1000XM6. Could that expected next-gen pair sit pretty at the top of this list soon, or will the also rumored AirPods Pro 3 be a match for them?\nOur best budget choice, meanwhile, is the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, which offer excellent value at an affordable price point. Check them - and other class-leading pairs - out below...\nBest overall wireless earbuds\nSony WF-1000XM5\n- Small and comfortable\n- Top-notch sound\n- Excellent noise canceling\n- Superb call quality\n- Bluetooth multipoint with LDAC\n- Fit isn't super secure\n| Specification: | |\n| Weight | 5.9 grams per earbud, 39 grams for case |\n| Type | Closed |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | Adaptive ANC, ANC, and transparency |\n| Battery life | 8 hours with ANC (12 without), 36 additional hours with case |\n| Hi-res Audio Support | Y |\nSony's industry-leading flagship wireless earbuds have delivered consistently great sound, are super comfortable, have fantastic battery life, and deliver some of the world's best ANC. The latest model, the XM5, are smaller and 20% lighter than the previous gen (XM4), and Sony has addressed some of the key concerns users had with the predecessor right out of the gate.\nThe XM5s are also more streamlined and elegant, making it less intrusive and sleeker. Fit-wise, the XM5s have redesigned foam eartips and come with a new extra small size, bringing the total to four options to fit ears of even more shapes and sizes.\nNew accelerometers in the XM5s open the door for some neat head-movement gestures (nod to accept a call, shake your head to decline), and Sony has switched to a dual processor system that, combined with resigned microphones and drivers, allow for a dedicated chip to specifically handle noise cancellation. Active noise cancelation is slightly better on the XM5s than their predecessor, and the model has a decent voice-targeting mode that helps you better hear conversations. But if ANC is a high priority for you, they still don't match the Apple AirPods Pro 2 for that.\nWith redesigned drivers that are 40% bigger than on the XM4s, it's no surprise that the XM5s sound better. Bass response is great, vocals are clear and defined, the soundstage is wide for a set of earbuds, and there's even new head-tracked spatial audio support that works well, as long as the phone you're using supports it. Indeed, as our experts note in our Sony XM5 review, \"Sony has never disappointed us when it comes to sound quality, and the XM5 are superb\".\nThe XM5s also feature Bluetooth Multipoint connectivity, allowing you to connect to two devices at once.\nAll-important battery life is unchanged in the XM5s, giving you up to eight hours of playtime with ANC on and 12 when it's off, along with two full charges from the case, for a total of up to 35 hours. A quick three-minute charge nets a whopping hour of playtime.\nSimply put, you can't get better all-round wireless earbuds at this premium price, although do be aware that the XM5's highly anticipated successors, the Sony WF-1000XM6, are rumored to arrive in the near future.\nBest budget wireless earbuds\nAnker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC\n- Thoughtful design\n- Great sound\n- Impressive noise-canceling\n- Very good call quality\n- Superb battery life\n- Bluetooth Multipoint\n- Mediocre transparency mode\n| Specification: | |\n| Weight | 5.4 grams per earbud, about 56 grams for case |\n| Type | Closed |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | Adaptive ANC, Transparency mode |\n| Battery life | Up to 10 hours with ANC, up to 50 hours total with the charging case. |\n| Hi-res Audio Support | Yes |\nEvery so often, a pair of budget earbuds comes along that are so good for the price and have so many features that they leave us impressed and scratching our heads. Anker's latest Soundcore Liberty 4 NC are only $100, and yet they perform better than most pairs twice that price.\nThe Liberty 4 NC are comfortable, fit well and snugly, and have an IPX4 rating that workout folks will appreciate as they can stand up to sweat and can be rinsed off. They sound robust and balanced, have excellent bass response, and keep things free of distortion at reasonable volumes. There's also an app (HearID) that gives you some good personalization options for your perfect sound. For the audio nerds out there, the Liberty 4 NCs also support the hi-res LDAC audio codec (Android only, sorry), which is rare for a budget pair of earbuds.\nThe Liberty 4 NCs shine when it comes to ANC and transparency mode, though, with our expert reviewer gushing that the ANC stood up to even the $250 AirPods Pro 2. And the features! For your hundred clams, the Liberty 4 NCs feature excellent adaptive noise canceling, presets for things like planes and busses, and a manual slider for you to pick yourself. Transparency mode, our reviewer found, sounds natural, like you're not wearing earbuds, and does a good job of letting in just the right amount of outside noise. Call quality on the Liberty 4 NCs is good too, with solid compression of environmental noise. And that all-important sound quality also impresses, with our Soundcore Liberty 4 NC review stating that they \"deliver a more robust and better-balanced sound signature, especially in the midbass and bass\" compared to their Life P3 predecessor.\nBut how's the all-important battery? The Liberty 4 NC will last up to eight hours on a charge with ANC turned on, and a total of 40 hours when you include the charging case. They best the AirPods Pro (5.5/24 hours) as well as their next-step-up sibling, the $150 Soundcore Liberty 4 (7/24). Just buy them already.\nBest premium noise-canceling wireless earbuds\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds\n- Very comfortable\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Top-notch noise canceling\n- Hi-res and lossless audio\n- Excellent spatial audio\n- No wireless charging\n- Outdoor call quality could be better\n| Specification: | |\n| Weight | 6.24 grams per earbud, 59.8 grams for case |\n| Type | Closed |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | Adaptive ANC, ANC, and transparency |\n| Battery life | 6 hours with ANC, 24 hours with the case |\n| Hi-res Audio Support | Yes |\nIf you know anything about Bose, you know that noise cancellation is kind of the company's calling card. Bose was the first to debut the technology in a set of headphones and has been refining the science of silence ever since.\nIt was somewhat of a surprise when the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds arrived, as the previous-gen QuietComfort Earbuds II (QCE II) had only been out about a year, and indeed Bose has already replaced these Ultra with a second-gen model. Still, the Ultra are still available - and at a reasonable discount too - and remain some of the best ANC earbuds on the planet.\nDesign-wise, they fit comfortably, and in the sound department they are highly competitive - clear, rich and extra sparkly in the mids and upper high frequencies.\nThe QC Ultra Earbuds still have a modern specification too, with higher-quality wireless transmission through Qualcomm's Snapdragon Sound platform, which incudes the aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless Bluetooth codecs. You also get Immersive Audio, Bose's own take at spatial audio with head tracking, which our QC Ultra Earbuds review calls \"the best you can get\".\nBattery life is, sadly, one area that remains on the lower end: six hours per charge, with an additional 18 hours in the charging case. With immersive audio on, though, you only get 4/16, and you can quick-charge the earbuds, which earns an extra two hours after 20 minutes.\nUnfortunately, there's still no wireless charging, which is a bit of a bummer.\nThese caveats aside, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are easily some of the best wireless earbuds for noise-canceling you can buy, and a must-have for those who crave quiet. Now discounted in light of their successor's arrival, they are arguably more attractive buys than they've ever been.\nBest high-end wireless earbuds\nMaster & Dynamic MW09\n- Beautiful design and materials\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Capable noise-canceling\n- Huge amounts of battery life\n- Bluetooth Multipoint\n- Wireless charging\n- A bit heavy for workouts\n- Long delay between ANC modes\n| Specification: | |\n| Weight | 9 grams per earbud, up to 62.5 grams for case |\n| Type | Closed |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | ANC and two ambient sound modes |\n| Battery life | 12 hours with ANC (16 without ANC), 32 additional hours with the case |\n| Hi-res Audio Support | Yes |\nMaster & Dynamic, a New York-based brand known for producing high-quality wireless earbuds, has taken things a step further with the MW09. An upgrade to its predecessor, the MW08, it comes packed with features like hi-res audio, Bluetooth Multipoint connectivity, and wireless charging. This set of earbuds is a great option for those looking for a premium audio experience.\nM&W has kept its unique and stylish aesthetic with the MW09s, as well as their easy-to-use physical controls on each earpiece. They're also very comfortable and come with both silicone and foam eartips to you can get the perfect fit. The M&D app also has a fit test and the earbuds themselves feature an IP54 rating making them tolerable to sweat and rain, although our reviewer suggested that there are likely better earbuds for working out due to the MW09's extra bulk.\nThe MW08s were, by our estimation, some of the best sounding earbuds you could buy, and we're glad to report that the same is true for the MW09s. Full, beautiful bass is complimented by their insane level of definition and clarity in the mids and highs. EQ presets and five-band EQing is also available through the app, too, but they sound great out of the box.\nHowever, new surprises on the sound front come with the addition Snapdragon Sound, which brings aptX Adaptive on board for the ability to enjoy lossy hi-res at up to 24-bit/96kHz, and lossless CD quality at up to 16-bit/48kHz. Sadly though, these advanced audio codecs will only be available to those with Android devices and those with support for Snapdragon Sound. Apple devices need not apply.\nWhile the MW09's ANC and transparency modes don't compete on the same level as the AirPods Pro, Sony WF-1000QM5, or Bose QC Ultra Earbuds, they're still pretty good at blocking out all of life's everyday noises and letting you hear conversations and the outside sounds you want to hear. Call quality also holds its own, too.\nYou get to choose from two charging cases, one made of kevlar, and one made of aluminum, and they both offer wireless charging, IPX4 water resistance, and 32 hours of charging capacity. The MW09 earbuds themselves deliver an impressive 12 hours per charge with ANC on and 16 hours with it off, which is more than you'll ever really need.\nBest wireless earbuds for Apple users\nApple AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C\n- Excellent noise canceling\n- Best conversation mode we've tested\n- Solid audio quality\n- Capable of wireless lossless audio\n- Yes, USB-C\n- Best features only for Apple products\n- Still no biofeedback\n| Specification: | |\n| Weight | 5.3 grams per earbud, 50.8 grams for case |\n| Type | Closed |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | Adaptive ANC, ANC, and transparency |\n| Battery life | 6 hours with ANC, 30 hours for case |\n| Hi-res Audio Support | No, not technically |\nWith the original AirPods Pro proving to have been one of the most successful wireless earbuds of all time, Apple needed to show it could do it again with the second-gen model. First, it did, adding to their great design, comfortable fit, and improvements to ANC and battery life. But then they did it again is September of 2023 by ditching Lightning for USB-C, and adding dust resistance for a new IP54 designation.\nAll that said, the new AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C still feature shockingly good active noise cancellation. They are the only buds to give the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II some real competition. Transparency - always a high point for the AirPods Pro - has a feature called Adaptive Transparency. Just like Bose's ActiveSense, it keeps loud sounds from causing you discomfort and it works like a champ.\nThe Apple H2 chip in each earbud also delivers better call quality that handily kills off any background sounds that might interfere with your voice being heard.\nSound quality is excellent, too, with beautiful detail and depth, and excellent bass response and compatibility with Apple's immersive Spatial Audio. There's still no EQ adjustments, but if you love music, you'll love the way the AirPods Pro 2 sound.\nBattery life in the latest USB-C version still stands at six hours per charge, with 30 hours total when you include the charging case \u2013 which still has a built-in speaker, lanyard loop, and Apple U1 chip for ultra-precise location reporting via Find My. It also gets the same IP54 protection upgrade, and you can now charge the AirPods Pro 2 with your iPhone 15 or Mac using a USB-C-to-USB-C cable, which is super handy if you don't have access to power or a portable charging bank.\nThese are easily the best wireless earbuds for iPhone and Apple users, although do note that AirPods Pro 3 leaks suggest the next-gen pair could arrive in the coming months.\nBest budget wireless earbuds for Apple users\nApple AirPods (4th gen) with ANC\n- Surprisingly effective ANC\n- Improved fit/comfort\n- Solid sound quality\n- Excellent voice/call quality\n- Best for Apple device users\n| Specification: | |\n| Weight | 4.3 grams per earbud, 34.7 grams for case |\n| Type | Closed |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | Adaptive ANC, ANC, and transparency |\n| Battery life | 4 hours for ANC (5 with ANC off), up to 30 hours with case |\n| Hi-res Audio Support | No, not technically |\nThe AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), also known as the AirPods 4th Generation, are a solid choice for those seeking Apple's signature ease of use and seamless integration with other Apple devices, but who maybe don't want to spend the whole lot on the AirPods Pro 2. These earbuds feature an upgraded design that offers improved sound quality over their predecessors, boasting full-bodied bass and clear highs that provide a more immersive listening experience.\nAt the heart of the AirPods 4 is the H2 chip, which enables personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking. This feature ensures that sound feels like it is coming from all around you, making for an engaging audio experience, particularly for music and movies. The effective active noise cancellation significantly reduces background noise, allowing users to focus solely on their audio content. Additionally, the Adaptive Audio feature intelligently adjusts between ANC and Transparency mode based on your surroundings, providing optimal listening conditions whether you're in a busy caf\u00e9 or enjoying some quiet time.\nDespite these advantages, it's worth noting that the open-ear design may not fit securely for everyone, which can lead to inconsistent noise cancellation in noisy environments. The battery life is average for truly wireless earbuds, especially with ANC activated; users can expect around five to six hours of listening time, with the charging case providing additional power on the go. Some users may also find the lack of a user-adjustable equalizer limiting, which could disadvantage those who enjoy customizing their audio experience.\nOverall, while the AirPods 4 with ANC are an excellent option for Apple users who value convenience and sound quality, those seeking top-tier noise cancellation, more robust bass response, or longer battery life might want to explore alternative options.\nBest wireless earbuds for sports and athletics\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\n- Solid, satisfying sound\n- Extremely secure, comfortable fit\n- Physical buttons\n- Heart rate monitoring\n- Works well with iOS and Android OS\n- Case is still bulky\n- ANC is not quite as good as competitors\n| Specification: | |\n| Weight | 8.7 grams per bud, 69 grams for case |\n| Type | Closed |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | ANC and transparency |\n| Battery life | 8 hours with ANC (10 without ANC), 45 total with the case |\n| Hi-res Audio Support | No, not technically |\n| Weight | 8.7 grams per bud, 69 grams for case |\nBeats has always done a great job at making earbuds for active people who need quality products that can take a beating, whether that's during workouts or, say, you find yourself getting in a lot of water balloon fights.\nThe Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds are a perfect match for this kind of punishment. Not only do they have the sturdy, lightweight and versatile build that make them perfect for wearing during exercise, but they also sport (excuse the pun) more advanced features than many fitness-focused rivals, such as effective noise-canceling and transparency, personalized spatial audio, handy wireless charging and accurate heart rate monitoring.\nOur expert reviewer tested the accuracy of their heart rate sensor against a Garmin Epix 2 and an Apple Watch Series 10 , and reported that they displayed basically the same numbers as those other devices, with \"occasional differences of only a few BPM (beats per minute)\".\nWhen used with an Apple device, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have easy one-touch pairing setup, audio sharing with other compatible Apple and Beats headphones and earbuds, Find My, head tracking with spatial audio, hands-free \u201cHey Siri\u201d activation, and iCloud pairing. But they are also nicely integrated into the Android ecosystem too, making them just as suitable for fans of either camp.\nCall quality is impressive, and as our Powerbeats Pro 2 review notes, \"bass is clean and punchy\", \"the upper mids and highs have nice clarity and airiness\" and \"spatial audio performance is solid\".\nAll in all, Beats' latest sport buds are an easy choice for workouts.\nBest wireless earbuds for comfort\nTechnics EAH-AZ100\n- Superb audio quality\n- Light, comfy design\n- Top-notch noise cancellation\n- Improved call quality\n- Tons of customization\n- Best-in-class Multipoint\n- No Auracast support for iPhones\n| Specification: | |\n| Weight | 5.9 grams per earbud, 42 grams for case |\n| Type | Closed |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | ANC and transparency |\n| Battery life | 7.5 hours with ANC, 25 total with the case |\n| Hi-res Audio Support | Yes |\nAs their price demands, the Technics EAH-AZ100 are mightily wireless earbuds that excel in several areas, making them a top choice for audio enthusiasts. One of their standout features is the extraordinary audio quality, which is well-balanced and detailed and a notch above the others in this list. Whether you lean towards the crisp highs of classical music, the lively midrange of rock, or the deep, resonant bass found in hip-hop, these earbuds deliver an immersive listening experience that caters to various music genres. The clarity and definition of sound allow listeners to appreciate the subtleties of their favorite tracks.\nIn addition to its sonic prowess, the EAH-AZ100 offer effective noise cancellation. The technology is adept at drowning out most ambient sounds, whether the hum of a busy street, chatter in a caf\u00e9, or the noise of an airplane engine.\nAnother highlight of the EAH-AZ100 is their comfort. These earbuds are lightweight and designed for a snug fit, which is particularly beneficial for extended listening sessions. Multiple eartip sizes ensure that users can find the right fit for their ears, further enhancing comfort and noise isolation. And their battery life is decent too, at between seven and 12 hours on a single charge, with the charging case providing an additional 29 hours.\nHowever, there is a drawback to consider. While providing a sleek and modern interface, the touch controls can sometimes be finicky and may require multiple attempts to register commands like play, pause, or skip tracks. This can be frustrating, especially when quick interaction is needed.\nOverall, the Technics EAH-AZ100 are solid choices for those searching for a premium pair of true wireless earbuds. With their excellent sound quality, effective noise cancellation and comfortable design, they cater well to avid listeners who prioritize audio above all else.\nBest wireless earbuds for Android or Google Pixel users\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2\n- Incredibly light and comfy\n- Stellar noise canceling\n- Great sound quality\n- Fun Google Gemini integration\n- No hi-res codecs\n- Limited spatial audio\n| Specification: | |\n| Weight | 6 grams per earbud, 65 grams for case |\n| Type | Closed |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | ANC and transparency |\n| Battery life | 7 hours for ANC (11 with ANC off), up to 31 hours with case |\n| Hi-res Audio Support | No, not technically |\nThe Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 are solid all-rounders for those in the market for Android and Google Pixel users looking for wireless earbuds. Their design prioritizes comfort, providing a snug fit for extended listening sessions without discomfort. The sound quality is well-balanced, emphasizing clarity across various genres, whether listening to podcasts or your favorite playlists. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is respectable, effectively reducing background noise in most everyday scenarios, such as commuting or working in a caf\u00e9.\nOne of the standout features for Android and Google Pixel users is the seamless integration with the ecosystem. Hands-free access to Google Assistant means users can easily manage their tasks, control music playback, and get information without needing to touch their devices. Another practical advantage is switching between multiple devices with multipoint connectivity. This allows users to connect their Pixel Buds Pro 2 to their phone, tablet, or computer simultaneously and switch fluidly between them without hassle.\nHowever, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 do have some caveats. Although the noise cancellation works well for general use, it may fall short in more challenging environments or when dealing with specific high-frequency sounds, which can leak through. Additionally, they do not support higher-quality Bluetooth codecs like aptX or LDAC, which can be a let-down for audiophiles who prioritize sound fidelity and detail.\nBest budget open-ear wireless earbuds\nSoundcore AeroFit 2\n- Comfortable and secure\n- Very good sound quality\n- Excellent for calls\n- Wireless charging\n- Bluetooth Multipoint\n- No LE Audio or Auracast\n- Mics will pick up wind noise\n| Specification: | |\n| Weight | 10 grams per bud, 65 grams for case |\n| Type | Open-ear |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | No |\n| Battery life | 10 hours per bud, 42 hours with case |\n| Hi-res Audio Support | No |\nSoundcore has a strong reputation for making audio devices that deliver 90% of the performance you\u2019ll get from big brands like Sony, Bose, and Apple, for around half the price - and its AeroFit 2 are great examples of that. The open-ear wireless buds, which by their design's nature allow you to listen to music while being somewhat aware of your surroundings, cost just $100 and offer much more than that very reasonable RRP requires.\nOpen earbuds don't tend to sound as good as traditional closed alternatives, but the AeroFit 2 are surprisingly capable. They go loud enough for all but the noisiest of places, and as we mentioned in our Soundcore AeroFit 2 review, they \"manage to deliver solid, enjoyable sound in most conditions. In quiet, indoor locations, you\u2019ll even get a surprising amount of bass - the Achilles heel of open-ear earbuds.\"\nWhere open earbuds excel is in their comfort, and the AeroFit 2 throw up very few complaints in this department. Our reviewer had no problem wearing them all day, even with glasses on, and they stayed put during a gym workout, including when he was lying on his back. With an IP55 rating, they will handle sweat and splashes without issue, too.\nThey also offer a better battery life than many of their rivals, with 10 hours in the buds accompanied by an extra 32 hours in the charging case. And great call quality (so long as you are out of the wind) and Bluetooth Multipoint support seal the deal, too.\nYou don't get noise-canceling here, nor next-gen Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast support, but that isn't surprising at this affordable price point. What is are the performance, feature and comfort basics, and Soundcore has nailed this once again.\nBest premium open-ear wireless earbuds\nSony LinkBuds Open\n- Comfortable fit\n- Much better balanced sound\n- Surprising passive isolation\n- Plenty of custom options\n- LE Audio for Android\n- Superb battery life\n- Spatial sound is terrible\n- Awkward voice controls\n- Phone calls can be tough with background noise\n| Specification: | |\n| Type | Open-ear |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | Always-on ambient |\n| Battery life | 5.5 hours, up to 17.5 hours with charging case |\n| Hi-res Audio Support | No |\n| Weight | 4 grams per earbud, 35 grams for case |\nWith an open-ring design as opposed to a more traditional eartip one that fills your ear canal, the Sony LinkBuds Open are innovative wireless earbuds that provide a distinct listening experience while enhancing environmental awareness - ideal for users prioritizing safety, such as road cyclists.\nThey are lightweight and comfortable for prolonged use, offering a secure fit without the discomfort often associated with in-ear buds, making them suitable for workouts and commutes.\nDespite their open-ear design, they deliver good sound quality with clear vocals and detailed highs, though bass response may be lacking for bass-heavy music genres. Users can engage in conversations naturally without removing the earbuds, which is useful in social or busy environments.\nHowever, the absence of active noise cancellation (ANC) means background noise can intrude, potentially affecting sound quality in loud settings. Additionally, the open design may cause sound leakage, which can disrupt others nearby if you're listening to music particularly loudly.\nOverall, the LinkBuds Open are perfect for casual listeners, commuters, and active individuals who value comfort and situational awareness, though those seeking strong noise cancellation or deep bass might find better options elsewhere.\nGot more cash to splash? We would recommend you consider the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds ($299), which justify their premium price tag with better sound and battery life, plus spatial audio support.\nBest wireless sleepbuds\nOzlo Sleepbuds\n- Supremely comfortable to wear\n- Battery lasts for multiple nights\n- High-quality Sleep Sounds\n- Bluetooth audio streaming\n- Uncluttered app\n- Sleep Monitoring feature still missing\n- Slow initial connection process\n- Abrupt alarm\n| Specification: | |\n| Type | Sleepbuds |\n| Ambient Sound Modes | None |\n| Battery life | 10 hours on a single charge |\nThe Ozlo Sleepbuds are meticulously designed to enhance sleep quality. These innovative earbuds are incredibly comfortable to wear and highly effective at reducing ambient noise, thanks to their thoughtful combination of passive isolation and a variety of soothing sounds. Users can choose from an array of pre-loaded ambient noises, such as gentle rain, ocean waves, or white noise, which can help create a peaceful sleeping environment.\nAdditionally, you can also play your personal audio, like music and podcasts, from your phone via its Bluetooth connection. Our reviewer, Andy Boxall, praised its variety of Bluetooth settings in his review: \"One disables streaming entirely, one enables both streaming and sleep sounds, and the final option enables streaming for 10 minutes to help conserve battery. You can also tell the app to switch from streaming to a Sleep Sound after a set amount of time,\" he writes.\nOne standout feature is their impressive battery life, which allows them to last throughout an entire night's sleep \u2014 averaging up to 10 hours on a single charge. This makes them particularly handy for those who struggle with sleep disturbances due to external noises.\nHowever, the Ozlo Sleepbuds are relatively expensive, which might deter some potential users. They also lack some features commonly found in other sleep earbuds. For example, they do not offer active noise cancellation, which can provide an additional layer of sound blocking.\nAnother area that could be improved is the built-in alarm feature. Many users have reported finding it quite jarring, disrupting the relaxation the earbuds aim to promote. Additionally, a sleep monitoring feature was promised but is still notably missing from the overall functionality, which could have provided valuable insights into sleep patterns and improvements.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nYes, as long as the PC has Bluetooth. Some have Bluetooth by default, but if yours doesn't, you can add it with an a. Many increasingly feature Bluetooth Multipoint connectivity giving you the ability to connect the earbuds to more than one source, like a smartphone and a computer, at the same time.\nYes. You can enable most devices' Bluetooth radio while in airplane mode.\nWired earbuds will tend to have the better performance-value ratio, although the gap is closing thanks to the introduction of higher-quality Bluetooth audio codecs such as aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive, as well as the Bluetooth LE Audio standard. Wireless earbuds are better for convenience, especially now that many phone makers have stopped including a 3.5mm headphone jack.\nNot always, but the vast majority do come with a charging case and some come with wireless charging cases. If they don\u2019t come with a case, we strongly recommend you don\u2019t buy them.\nYes, they are awesome for workouts, as long as they have waterproofing or an IP rating and fit snugly in your ears. Our best wireless earbuds for sport above are particularly good for their fitness-friendly design and fit."

      "text": "- Awesome sound and call quality\n- Fantastic battery life\n- Great noise canceling\n- Compelling app-based features\n- Comfortable fit\n- No water resistance\n- A bit bulky\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nEditor\u2019s note: Sony still sells these fantastic earbuds (now at a lower price) but it has also launched the newer WF-1000XM4, which add several new features while improving on noise cancellation and transparency.\nFor years, we\u2019ve considered Sony one of our favorite headphone makers in the game, with its noise-canceling WH-1000XM4 (and their three predecessors) perennially topping our list of the best headphones and earning Digital Trends\u2019 Editor\u2019s Choice honors.\nSo when Sony released its true wireless earbud version, the WF-1000XM3, in 2019, we weren\u2019t surprised at all when they wowed us by offering substantial noise-canceling, great fidelity, and the same great app-based features we have enjoyed from the company for years.\nBut in the time since their debut, some strong contenders have emerged. Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro made their own splashy launch, as did the Google Pixel Buds 2 and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2. We still think very highly of the WF-1000XM3, but these competitors have proven that Sony\u2019s accomplishments are no longer unique.\nFit and finish\nThe WF-1000XM3\u2019s name confusingly bears an \u201cM3,\u201d or Mark 3, to match the uber-popular over-ear WH-1000XM3 (which have since been superseded by the even better WH-1000XM4), even though these are only Sony\u2019s second edition in this specific line of true wireless earbuds. The new buds come in a slick black-and-copper charging case with a flat top embossed with the Sony logo.\nThat USB-C-powered case is substantial in size, but can still fit in most pockets, and the flat top allows you to easily lay it topside-down on surfaces when you\u2019ve got the buds in. The cap flips up to reveal the two earbuds inside, and a big red LED on the front of the case lets you see if they\u2019re charging.\nAesthetically, these buds aren\u2019t much to write home about. That\u2019s likely a purposeful choice by the Sony team \u2014 given that many buyers of noise-canceling headphones are commuters and businesspeople, it makes sense the company would stick to a tried-and-true design, with simple, pill-shaped housings and a black-and-gray color scheme with small copper accents. They\u2019re bulkier than the AirPods Pro, yet also understated compared to Apple\u2019s iconic white golf tees.\nIf you\u2019ve been in the working world for some time, the look will be familiar: The earbuds resemble miniature versions of the Bluetooth headset you might have worn around town in 2006, with the oval-shaped shell joining an ergonomic inner section with rounded acoustic chambers that culminate in soft silicone eartips. Sony includes two different tip thicknesses in three sizes (small, medium, and large), all but guaranteeing you\u2019ll find a pair that\u2019s right for you.\nFeatures and controls\nThere are very few wireless earbuds that compete with the Sony WF-1000XM3 in terms of features. For starters, the headphones boast a solid eight hours of battery life per charge with noise-canceling off, and a still AirPods Pro-besting six hours with it on. The case also has plenty of juice, offering three full charges for 18 hours of backup battery if you\u2019re using the headphones with noise-canceling on, and 24 hours with it off.\nThere\u2019s also a quick-charge feature that will get you 90 minutes of playback in just 10 minutes \u2013 great for those who are forgetful about recharging before commutes or short flights. A newer pair of Sony earbuds, the WF-SP800N, does have the XM3 beat in the battery department. The SP800N boasts nine hours of playback with ANC on and a massive 13 hours with it off.\nA glossy touchpad on each bud\u2019s exterior allows you to play and pause music, access your voice assistant, and change songs. Sony has also packed in some other nifty extras, including the ability to long-touch the left earbud to temporarily pipe in sound from the outside world, so you won\u2019t have to remove a headphone while you\u2019re trying to hear announcements or make a drink order on a plane.\nSpeaking of removing your earbuds, like the AirPods Pro, the WF-1000XM3 have sensors that pause music and eventually go to sleep when you remove them. Pop them back in and they\u2019ll resume playback or turn on and reconnect, depending on how long you\u2019ve left them unused.\nThese headphones have a staggering amount of noise reduction for their size.\nIn terms of their marquee feature, noise-canceling, Sony has packed the tiny buds with its QN1e noise-canceling chip (the same one inside its popular over-ear noise cancelers) and placed two microphones on each earbud to help block out the outside world. That processing works like an absolute charm, easily drowning out keyboard clicks, public transit noise, and loud in-office conversations.\nYou won\u2019t get the same insane reduction you\u2019ll hear on the bigger WH-1000xM3 over-ears, but these headphones have a staggering amount of reduction for their size. Coupled with the fact that they offer excellent passive noise isolation on their own, we\u2019re very impressed with their performance in loud spaces.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro deliver ANC performance that is the equal of \u2014 and possibly even better than \u2014 the 1000XM3.\nEach earbud can also be used separately on calls or for music, and the microphones and noise canceling worked wonders for call clarity, with sound quality that is akin to many dedicated Bluetooth headsets.\nUnlike many headphones, where apps seem mostly designed to aid pairing, the Sony Connect app offers some great features, including the ability to adjust equalization, set your desired level of noise canceling, and assign the button for Google Assistant \u2014 the primary voice assistant on these headphones.\nSince Sony seems to be agnostic when it comes to voice assistants, you can choose to talk to Siri or even Amazon\u2019s Alexa instead.\nThey don\u2019t have an IP rating for water resistance, so gym use is an at-your-own-risk situation.\nFor some, the WF-1000XM3\u2019s biggest shortcoming is that they don\u2019t have any water resistance, so gym use is an at-your-own-risk situation. When they launched \u2014 and when we first reviewed them \u2014 they also wouldn\u2019t let you control the volume without having to reach for your phone or pull up your voice assistant. Sony has since fixed that issue with a new option in its app that lets you choose between volume control and ANC on/off.\nNormally, we\u2019d criticize a manufacturer of $230 in-ear headphones for a lack of water resistance, given that one of the best uses for true wireless earbuds is at the gym, where sweat can be a serious factor. However, we don\u2019t think the absence is a big deal here for two reasons.\nFirst, the headphones seem designed more for office and business trips than the iron palace, and second, Sony claims it hasn\u2019t gotten any complaints about the previous-generation earbuds breaking at the gym. Sony seems confident you can use the WF-1000XM3 for workouts, provided you\u2019re not sweating buckets.\nStill, Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro manage to offer IPX4, with most of the same bells and whistles. Sony\u2019s own WF-SP800N offer an IP55 water-resistance rating, which suggests that Sony thinks you should look at that model if you\u2019re really concerned about water.\nSound quality\nSony equipped its newest earbuds with its proprietary DSEE HX engine, which is designed to upscale lo-fi sound for better overall clarity. It works wonders on the WF-1000XM3, combining with noise canceling to provide some of the best fidelity you\u2019ll find in wireless earbuds.\nWe\u2019ve listened to everything from the lush pop of Gen Z icon Billie Eilish to indie rockers Golden Daze, finding ourselves consistently impressed by everything we\u2019ve heard.\nTreble is clear and crisp, and there is a hefty low end that never becomes a mud pit. Instead, songs feel like they have a weight and depth that we often miss on other pairs of true wireless earbuds, which tend to feel a bit exaggerated in terms of their sonic profiles.\nPlus \u2014 and this is a big plus \u2014 the sound is customizable. If the sound signature isn\u2019t quite to your liking, you can adjust it via the EQ settings in the app, so you\u2019ll never be annoyed with the way the headphones treat certain genres. Want a bit more sheen and cymbal shimmer in your jazz recordings? Just boost the treble a touch. Problem solved.\nWhile it is fun to mess around with the EQ settings, we spent the vast majority of our listening time with the headphones in the standard, flat EQ position. That\u2019s because they already feel very well-tuned straight from the factory. Everything we listened to through the WF-1000XM3 sounded amazing right out of the box, and that\u2019s really all we can ask from any pair of headphones, especially true wireless in-ears.\nOur take\nWhile no longer the only great true wireless earbuds to offer noise canceling, the WF-1000XM3 are still the best when you consider their sound quality, battery life, and copious additional features and customization. If you can get them on sale, you should, but even at their regular price of $230, these earbuds are worth every penny.\nIs there a better alternative?\nSince the Sony WF-1000XM3 debuted, Apple\u2019s $249 AirPods Pro emerged, and they\u2019re a wonder, proving themselves the WF-1000XM3\u2019s equal in terms of noise cancellation and coming very close on sound quality. Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 2 make for an apt comparison, too, though they\u2019re more expensive at $300.\nThe real competitor here might be in-house, however, with the Sony WF-SP800N exceeding the XM3 in important categories like battery life and waterproofing. They don\u2019t sound as great or have the noise=canceling abilities of the 1000XM3, but the SP800N still sound solid for $30 less. Not sure which one to buy? Check out our WF-1000XM3 vs. WF-SP800N comparison.\nHow long will they last?\nSony has made excellent headphones for decades, and we have no reason to believe the build quality of the WF-1000xM3 is any different. It is worth noting that the life span of all true wireless headphones is limited by battery longevity, but we expect you\u2019ll get at least a few years before the batteries start to show severe wear.\nShould you buy them?\nYes \u2014 especially if you\u2019re an Android user. If you want a feature-packed pair of true wireless headphones, and you like the sound of silence, the Sony WF-1000XM3 are still one of the best you\u2019ll find."

Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nIn some ways, Sony didn\u2019t need to update its flagship wireless headphones. Even as of May 14, 2025, one day before the official launch of the WH-1000XM6, you\u2019d have been hard pressed to find a list of the best wireless headphones (including here at Digital Trends) that didn\u2019t put Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM5 in first place. This, despite the fact that the XM5 are now three years old, and virtually all of their competitors have been update during that time. That\u2019s how good they still are.\nBut we all have a tendency to gravitate towards the newest, shiniest object, and besides, for all of its merits, the XM5 did have one or two areas that needed improvement. So here we are.\nLet me cut right to the chase. The WH-1000XM6 are amazing. Stellar. The best. And if I\u2019m being honest, you should just buy the WH-1000XM5 while they\u2019re still available. Here\u2019s why.\nDesign\nIf you\u2019re looking for an excuse reason to buy the $450 WH-1000XM6, look no further than their updated design. Sony may claim otherwise, but this is where you\u2019ll find the biggest difference between them and their predecessors.\nI\u2019ve always liked the look of the XM5, but now that I\u2019ve laid my eyes on the XM6, I can\u2019t unsee the areas where the XM5 feel a little cheap. For the XM6, Sony has found a plastic formulation that doesn\u2019t look or feel like plastic at all. It\u2019s more like synthetic stone, and it gives these cans an upscale vibe that the XM5 were aiming for, but never quite hit.\nThe earcups are now seamless, solid shells, their matte surfaces interrupted only by the eight microphone openings. But even these are beautifully crafted, with flush-mounted metal grilles instead of gaping holes. The earcushions are now much easier to remove.\nThe hinges are also remarkable. When you look at the AirPods Max, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, or the WH-1000XM5, you realize that when you connect a headband to a set of earcups via a single point of contact (instead of the usual yoke approach), you tend to sacrifice the ability to fold up and fold flat, leaving a less compact shape.\nSony\u2019s new hinges bring back that missing second axis of movement without resorting to the older, yoke-style architecture \u2014 which Bose opted for on its QuietComfort Ultra Headphones.\nThe other significant change is the headband. It\u2019s now wider, better padded, and asymmetrical. The first two are all about enhanced comfort, but Sony hopes the asymmetrical shape will help folks figure out the headphones\u2019 orientation a little faster. Sonos did the same thing on the Ace headphones, but in both cases, I find it easier to just look at the earcups (if the two control buttons are in my left hand, I know they\u2019re the right way \u2018round).\nOh, and let\u2019s give Sony some serious props for giving the XM6\u2019s travel case a quick-release magnetic closure. So much better than a zipper!\nSony WH-1000XM6 specs\n| Price | $450 |\n| Weight | 8.96 ounces |\n| Form factor | Closed-back, over-ear |\n| Noise cancellation | Yes |\n| Battery life | 40 hours per charge (ANC off), 30 hours (ANC on) |\n| Charging | USB-C |\n| Voice assistant | Native smartphone access Hands-free Google Assistant (Android only) |\n| Multipoint | Yes |\n| Spatial audio | Yes (with head tracking, Android only) |\n| Hi-res audio | Yes (wired/wireless) |\n| Fast pairing | Google Fast Pair |\n| Bluetooth/codecs | BT 5.3 with AAC, SBC, LC3, LDAC |\n| Auracast | Yes (Android only) |\nComfort, controls, and connections\nThe headband isn\u2019t the only change for comfort\u2019s sake; the earcushions are also more generously padded. Sony has upped the clamping force, too, and the result is a more secure fit that remains very comfortable, even for several hours in a row. I don\u2019t really get the whole full-size over-ear headphones thing at the gym or while running, but I know there are many who do. If that\u2019s your thing, the XM6 are a better choice than the XM5. Just remember, they have no official IP rating for water or sweat resistance.\nI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t point out that the XM6\u2019s clever new hinge design relies partly on a spring-loaded mechanism, similar to the one Apple uses on the AirPods Max. This puts the pivot point where the hinge meets the earcup, as opposed to the XM5\u2019s mechanism, which puts it at the midpoint of the earcup.\nFor me, it creates a small but perceptible gap between the bottom of the earcup and my head, unless I extend the headband sliders more than feels normal. It\u2019s not a deal-breaker by any means, it\u2019s just something to be aware of.\nThe XM6\u2019s controls are almost identical to the XM5. The right earcup gives you physical buttons for ANC mode selection and power/pairing, while the left is touch sensitive for playback and volume gestures. The one difference is that you can now enable a microphone mute function via the ANC button while on a call.\nIt\u2019s a very intuitive setup and works brilliantly. The only drawback is that XM6\u2019s controls aren\u2019t cold-weather friendly unless you have capacitive-compatible gloves.\nStill, unlike the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones and Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless Headphones (which also use touch-based gestures for some or all controls), Sony gives you an alternative: hands-free voice commands. If you enable them in the Sound Connect app, you can say, \u201cHey, Headphones,\u201d followed by \u201cplay song,\u201d \u201cpause song,\u201d \u201craise the volume,\u201d etc. Basically, everything you can do with a gesture or button, you can do with your voice, and it\u2019s seamless. The one caveat is that you must choose between Sony\u2019s voice commands or button-based access to your phone\u2019s voice assistant (or hands-free Google Assistant on Android).\nSony\u2019s Bluetooth connections are always rock solid, and the WH-1000XM6 are no exception. When using an Android phone, Google Fast Pair makes pairing very easy (plus it adds the XM6 to Find My).\nMultipoint lets you keep the cans connected to two devices simultaneously, and the Sony Sound Connect app makes managing those devices a breeze.\nSound quality\nOne of the biggest reasons Sony\u2019s 1000X series has dominated lists of the best headphones over the years is their sound. These cans have always provided powerful, precise, full-frequency sound, with plenty of detail. The XM6 are no exception.\nWhat these new cans bring to the table are subtle improvements in clarity, especially through the midrange \u2014 traditionally the hardest part of the frequency spectrum to achieve additional detail.\nYou can think of it as peeling back another layer of onion skin.\nWhen Sony introduced the XM5, it shifted slightly away from the XM4\u2019s bass-forward balance to a more neutral tuning. Curiously, even though the XM6 is a twin to the XM5 when it comes to sound signature, that added level of detail and nuance helps low-end bass feel tighter. It\u2019s not more prominent \u2014 again, the balance is almost identical \u2014 but you can hear the improvement in separation from the lower mids.\nSony offers a variety of EQ presets and customization options in the Sound Connect app as well as its \u201cFind My EQ\u201d personalization test, but I ignored them all \u2014 the company\u2019s factory tuning is that good.\nAll of this to say, if you like the XM5, I think you\u2019ll like the XM6 even more when listening critically, particularly if you have an Android phone and take advantage of Sony\u2019s LDAC Bluetooth codec.\nAnd if you\u2019ve never tried any of Sony\u2019s flagship headphones, prepare yourself to be wowed. They\u2019ve always been a top-notch choice, and the XM6 are the best so far.\nThe one thing I wish Sony had included is USB Audio. In this price range, it\u2019s nearly ubiquitous \u2014 even Apple added it to the AirPods Max, and that company has a track record of being slow to adopt new tech. USB Audio would give the XM6 a truly lossless connection with support for hi-res audio up to whatever Sony\u2019s built-in DAC can handle (likely 24-bit/96kHz or better). For such a great-sounding set of cans, this feels like a real oversight.\nSpatial audio\nNew for the XM6 is the ability to spatialize any stereo sound using the Sound Connect app\u2019s listening mode settings. Sony calls it 360 Reality Audio Upmixing and has decided that it should be all about making video content more immersive. It even calls the spatial audio mode \u201cCinema.\u201d\nDespite the name, it works on any audio \u2014 not just movies or TV \u2014 and in typical Sony fashion, it\u2019s masterfully executed. The soundstage opens up, getting wider, deeper, and even a little taller, and there\u2019s a greater sense of spatial separation between audio elements like vocals and instruments. Most importantly, Sony\u2019s processing mostly avoids the unpleasant level changes that lesser spatial systems often produce. In the worst versions, bass can become smeared, and vocals lose much of their presence. Sony\u2019s Cinema keeps things focused. Stereo purists aren\u2019t going to love it \u2014 there\u2019s no avoiding the sensation that you\u2019re listening to processed sound \u2014 but if you dig that more immersive sound, Sony\u2019s version is a lot of fun.\nSadly, iPhone users will have to satisfy themselves with a \u201cstatic\u201d spatial presentation. The XM6\u2019s head tracking is only enabled via Android 13 or higher. For music, I don\u2019t think it matters. For Sony\u2019s cinematic ambitions, however, head tracking is the key that unlocks the sensation of sitting in a home theater. It keeps the relative position of each virtual 5.1 speaker locked in space \u2014 turning your head makes it feel like you\u2019ve turned away from the central source of dialogue right in front of you.\nIt\u2019s not as effective as Apple\u2019s version using the combo of an iPhone or Apple TV 4K with a set of AirPods Max or AirPods Pro, and it\u2019s currently limited to just a few services like Netflix and YouTube.\nNoise cancellation and transparency\nActive noise cancelling (ANC) on the XM5 is already excellent. In fact, the only headphones that can beat them are Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. For the XM6, Sony went all out to change that ranking, giving the new cans more microphones (12 vs 8) and seven times faster ANC processing.\nThese changes give the XM6 an edge over their predecessors, and I\u2019d even go so far as to say that in certain circumstances, where external noises tend to be highly variable, they do a slightly better job than the QuietComfort Ultra. But for pure, brute-force destruction of constant droning sounds like in an airplane cabin or on public transit, the QuietComfort Ultra still reign supreme.\nHowever, if you\u2019re very sensitive to ANC side effects (some people report an unpleasant, sucking sensation), you may be better off with the WH-1000XM6. Sony\u2019s ANC system may not cancel quite as much noise as Bose\u2019s, but it\u2019s also gentler on your ears.\nTransparency mode is also excellent, giving you a nearly perfect reproduction of the outside world. Are the WH-1000XM6 better than the AirPods Max and QuietComfort Ultra? No, but you may still prefer Sony\u2019s version, which slightly boosts the higher frequencies associated with speech, instead of going for a completely natural passthrough.\nI think what I like most about Sony\u2019s ANC and transparency is how quickly you can shift between them \u2014 it\u2019s nearly instant.\nYou can also turn on Sony\u2019s Speak-to-Chat feature, which switches to transparency mode automatically when it detects you speaking. It\u2019s very clever but your mileage may vary: I couldn\u2019t find a setting that reliably detected my voice without being triggered by false positives like clearing my throat.\nCall quality\nAt the risk of sounding repetitive, calling on the WH-1000XM6 is also a subtle improvement over the XM5, which were already pretty darn great. I\u2019d say the biggest difference is that the XM6 preserve more of your voice\u2019s natural sound. There\u2019s better tonality and less sibilance on all of those ess-sounds.\nThe XM6\u2019s ability to cancel background noise remains top-notch. Your callers will likely never know you\u2019re walking past a construction site.\nFor the first time, Sony has added a mic muting option, which is very handy. Just keep in mind that your phone app probably won\u2019t reflect these mode changes (the iPhone doesn\u2019t), so you\u2019ll have to remember which mode you\u2019re in.\nYou can switch to transparency mode at any time to hear your own voice more clearly and Sony includes a specific voice boost option in the app to help with that if you need it.\nThe only wireless headphones that are better for calls are JBL\u2019s Tour One M3.\nBattery life\nThis might be the one area where Sony has made no improvements at all. Playtime with ANC on is rated at 30 hours and 40 when it\u2019s off. One minute of charging buys you an extra hour of operation, but a full charge still takes about 3.5 hours.\nDoes it matter? I doubt it. When it comes to battery life, more is always better, but I think most folks can get through 99% of their lives on 40 hours or less.\nThe one big improvement is that you can now charge and use the XM6 simultaneously, something no previous 1000X series can do.\nExtras\nThe XM6 are the first of their kind to support Auracast, which is great. Unfortunately, it requires manually shifting to LE Audio within the Sound Connect app, then switching to the Android Bluetooth menu to find and connect to a local Auracast broadcast, which is a pain in the butt. Also, iPhone users are out of luck.\nThis is disappointing to me. Much like Sony\u2019s spatial audio feature, it feels like a half-measure. Moreover, we know that better is possible \u2014 JBL\u2019s Tour One M3 suffers from none of these limitations.\nSony has given its Adaptive Sound Control feature (which turns ANC on/off based on activity) a boost with its new scenes feature. You select from different scenes like running or going to the gym, and then choose the time and place associated with these activities and what you\u2019d like to listen to (on an iPhone, your choices are Apple Music, Spotify, or Endel). I appreciate that Sony wants to build some intelligence into the listening experience, but I don\u2019t find these features especially useful.\nConclusion\nSony\u2019s WH-1000XM6 are a meaningful upgrade from the company\u2019s WH-1000XM5, and take their place as the best overall wireless headphones I\u2019ve ever tested. They\u2019re not perfect \u2014 no USB audio, a bizarrely awkward Auracast setup, and spatial audio that can only be used to its fullest on Android, are drawbacks that must be considered, especially given that Sony has increased the price of its flagship cans to $450.\nI acknowledge that none of these issues stopped me or anyone I know from enjoying the XM5, and in all of the other areas that matter (sound, ANC, design, and comfort), the XM6 are a stellar choice.\nBose is still better overall for noise canceling, but the XM6\u2019s real competition comes from its own predecessor. Now that Sony has discounted the XM5, and will likely keep prices low until it runs out of stock, you\u2019d be well advised to consider that model before buying."

Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nThe new AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C and MagSafe charging are just the same AirPods Pro we had before, but with a different charging port, right?\nNo. That is not the correct take.\nIt\u2019s not just about the new USB-C charging port and what comes with that. This latest version of the AirPods Pro 2 has as yet untapped potential that points to a pretty exciting future. I also want to use this review as an opportunity to talk about new features that are unlocked with iOS 17 and, as it happens, are also available on the AirPods Pro 2 with Lightning case that you may already own.\nUltimately, we\u2019ll try to help you decide if you should run out and buy the new USB-C version, or if you are good sticking with the AirPods Pro you already own.\nVideo review\nOut of the box\nWhen you pop open the box and unwrap the new USB-C AirPods Pro, you will, of course, notice the USB-C port. But I was also pleased to see that not only is a USB-C to USB-C cable included, but it is braided at that. No more cheap rubber. I am really into cloth-covered cables these days, and I was legitimately delighted when I made this discovery. My 14-year-old daughter noticed, too, and she dug it as well, so I know I\u2019m not the only one who thinks this is neat. I\u2019m bringing my daughter into this because she made some astute observations that I want to share here \u2014 more on that in a moment.\nMuch ado about charging\nI\u2019ve heard plenty of haters clowning on this USB-C development, be it on the AirPods Pro, or the new iPhone 15, or back when the new iPads started featuring it. Yeah, it would have been nice to have this years ago \u2014 one can even argue that it would have been the environmentally responsible thing to do, and that Apple has only transitioned due to pressure from the EU. But if you\u2019re trying to absolutely rake in the dough \u2014 as Apple has for some time \u2014 you make strategic decisions like requiring your customers to use a proprietary cable. I\u2019m not saying I love it, but let\u2019s not act like it was a stupid move.\nBut those days are in the rearview mirror now. Apple is now all-in on USB-C. And in the case of the new AirPods Pro 2 \u2014 literally, in the case \u2014 this means you can move toward tossing your Lightning cables into that drawer or bin with all the other cables you can\u2019t bring yourself to throw out.\nYou can now charge your AirPods with your iPhone 15 or Mac using your USB-C-to-USB-C cable, which might come in especially handy when you\u2019re about to take a flight and your AirPods are dead. Just charge them off your phone, and then you can handle charging your phone using the seatback charger on your flight.\nI was curious if you could also charge the AirPods Pro 2 with Lightning case using an iPhone 15, so I tried it, and I can confirm that the AirPods Pro 2 Lightning will charge that way using a USB-C to Lightning cable that you may already have.\nSo that\u2019s USB-C. What else is new? IP54 protection, which means dust resistance has been added. Let\u2019s not dwell on that too much. It\u2019s a nice step forward, but these things aren\u2019t waterproof yet. I look forward to the day I can safely shower with my wireless earbuds. Don\u2019t judge me.\niOS 17 improvements\nSo is that it? Is that all that\u2019s new? No, there\u2019s more, but first, let\u2019s look at some of the new features that were released alongside the new USB-C AirPods Pro, but are not limited to the new AirPods Pro \u2014 these are available if you have the Lightning version as well, so long as you are running iOS 17 and your AirPods Pro have the latest firmware.\nI\u2019m talking about Personalized Volume, Conversation Awareness, and Adaptive Noise Control. Here\u2019s what these three features are supposed to do.\nPersonalized Volume\nPersonalized Volume is meant to adjust the volume of your music or podcast \u2014 or whatever media it is you are listening to or watching \u2014 based on the noise level of your surroundings. It also learns your volume preferences over time and starts automatically delivering your media at what it learns is your preferred volume, so you don\u2019t have to go reaching for the volume control nearly as often. Eventually, I think you won\u2019t even know this is turned on. But if you were to turn it off after getting used to it, I would bet you would miss it.\nConversation Awareness\nConversation Awareness is Apple\u2019s take on a feature we\u2019ve seen attempted by other headphone makers. Conversation Awareness will allow your AirPods to lower the volume of your media when you start talking. It won\u2019t engage just because someone talks to you. But once you start speaking, not only will it lower the volume of whatever you\u2019re listening to, it will focus on the voices in front of you and tune into those, kind of like an automated transparency mode, but a little more focused for conversations. Now, if this feature actually works, I\u2019ll be thrilled.\nWhile I appreciate attempts at this feature by, say, Sony, for example, on its XM5 headphones and earbuds, what I have found is that any sufficiently loud noise will trigger it, turning off noise canceling and piping surrounding audio in. This is not good if what sets off the feature is something like a lawn mower or leaf blower, or some other loud piece of gear. I very much do not want that noise piped in as if I\u2019m having a conversation with it. So, if Apple has this truly dialed into voices and nothing else sets it off? That would be transformative.\nAdaptive Noise Control\nFinally, there\u2019s Adaptive Noise Control. This feature, which also uses machine learning and AI, blends noise canceling with transparency mode. The idea is to cancel out the noise you don\u2019t want, but let in the sounds you do want to hear. So, let\u2019s say you\u2019re on a flight. You want the whir of the engines to be canceled out, but you do want to hear any announcements made by the crew. Adaptive Noise Control makes that possible.\nI\u2019m really curious to see if and how this works and whether it\u2019s something I\u2019ll use all the time, or just in certain scenarios.\nReal-world use\nI took the AirPods Pro 2 out on a run for coffee to get some real-world experience with them. Let\u2019s start with Personalized Volume. I could tell it was starting to learn. Shortly after starting to watch a video, the volume, which was set lower than I usually have it, started to increase automatically. It matched the volume level at which I had been listening to music earlier. I tend to listen to videos at a slightly lower volume, so I\u2019m interested to see if the system can detect the media source and type and alter it accordingly. But I think I\u2019ll need to use this for more than a couple of days before I\u2019ll know. I\u2019ll update this review when I\u2019ve had a chance for more long-term use.\nThis works far better than any other version of this feature that I\u2019ve experienced before.\nAs for Conversation Awareness? Well, I haven\u2019t gotten to my leaf blower yet, but I did use a very loud AirHood vent fan and put my face right up next to it, and Conversation Awareness did not kick in. It also didn\u2019t kick in when someone really close to me started talking. And it didn\u2019t kick in when a bus rolled by outside, so this works far better than any other version of this feature that I\u2019ve experienced before, and I\u2019m loving it. The moment I speak, transparency kicks in and I can hear myself, so I\u2019m not speaking unnecessarily loudly, and I can clearly hear who I\u2019m talking to. This is legitimately real-life helpful.\nThe Adaptive Noise Control doesn\u2019t work exactly as I had imagined it. But, to be honest, how I had imagined it might work would probably be extremely annoying. Of course, I can only say that having experienced how Apple has envisioned it, I think Apple got this one right.\nIt really is a hybrid of noise-canceling and transparency mode. The noise-canceling is pretty light just walking around. If I don\u2019t have music playing, I can hear cars going by and other street noises. But as soon as there was a droning sound, that got knocked down significantly. The AirHood fan and a microwave were both knocked down in volume by what I judged to be about 50%, as opposed to the 90% or so that you would get from full-on noise canceling. But as the AirPods Pro 2 were quieting down the fan, I was still able to hear someone speaking to me.\nThe noise cancellation doesn\u2019t act as quickly in Adaptive Noise Control mode as it does in full noise-canceling mode. It takes a couple of seconds for it to calm this fan noise down. It\u2019s not snail\u2019s pace slow, but it does sound like someone is just turning the volume down on the fan noise generator.\nAgain, I\u2019m curious to see how this feature evolves over time and how I like implementing it into my daily use of the AirPods Pro 2. I do think that adaptive noise control is really best for folks who wear their AirPods Pro all the time and don\u2019t really want to ever take them out. That\u2019s not me. But I can still see myself using it selectively. And overall, I think this was a smart development from Apple.\nOne thing is certain: I can\u2019t think of another brand of earbuds or full-sized headphones that can do what the AirPods Pro 2 can do with these new iOS17-enabled features. Other brands have transparency or passthrough modes, they have dialogue detection, and some of them have adjustable levels of noise cancellation. Sony has all three of those. But none of them are executed nearly as well as Apple is executing them here. So, I\u2019ve got to give all three a pretty enthusiastic thumbs-up. I\u2019m going to enjoy using them, and not just for fun, but because it\u2019s practical. It\u2019s a small thing, but I can see how this is going to keep AirPods Pro in people\u2019s ears for longer. And if that was Apple\u2019s goal, then I think we will see in short order that it has succeeded.\nAgain, as a reminder, those three features work with your existing AirPods Pro and the new AirPods Pro with USB-C. But, I did say there was more that\u2019s new about the AirPods Pro with USB-C that I\u2019d talk about later. So, let\u2019s do that.\nRedesigned \u2018audio architecture\u2019\nSome of this is shrouded in mystery, some of it is just flying under the radar. So, Apple has said that it has redesigned the \u201cacoustic architecture\u201d inside these new AirPods Pro. The H2 chip is still in there. Apple won\u2019t get super specific about it, but it seems like the redesign is a combination of hardware, software, and programming changes all put together.\nBut what does it mean for you?\nWell, it doesn\u2019t mean dramatically different sound quality for day-to-day use \u2014 yet. As I listen to Apple Music, using Spatial Audio and standard stereo, I don\u2019t perceive any super notable differences in fidelity, whether I\u2019ve got ANC on full bore, turned off, or while using Adaptive Noise Control.\nHowever, we do know that the new AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C can do uncompressed lossless audio wirelessly \u2014 but only with the forthcoming Apple Vision Pro headset. Now, I\u2019ve learned a little more about this, but some things remain a secret.\nWhat I can tell you is that it is not Bluetooth. And there is no wireless audio codec involved. It\u2019s not FLAC, or AptX, or anything like that. It is raw, uncompressed, lossless audio at up to 20 bits.\nWhat\u2019s the technology allowing that? Well, we can only guess. I would say it is something akin to Ultra Wideband, which is the wireless tech that lets AirTags do their thing so well. But Apple would not say that, because Apple made this end-to-end, so it is not what we know as Ultra Wideband. We also know that the new case is not involved here. This is a communication protocol, again, for now, between the new AirPods Pro H2 chip and the H2 chip in the new Apple Vision Pro.\nWe also do not know what that wireless lossless range might be. But usually when you go up to higher bit rates, the range drops, so I would imagine it would be shorter than Bluetooth.\nNow, 20-bit may sound like an odd number. We\u2019re used to hearing about 16-bit or 24-bit. But in Apple\u2019s world, 24-bit merges into High-Res uncompressed lossless audio, and this isn\u2019t quite that. But it can be higher than CD-quality, which is 16-bit. I know, it\u2019s weird to bring CDs into the conversation because it\u2019s so far away, technologically. But that\u2019s a common 16-bit reference point.\nWhy any of this matters\nBefore you go poo-pooing uncompressed lossless wireless audio as something only true audio nerds care about, this is a big deal, in my opinion.\nRemember, I mentioned my daughter earlier. I brought her up because not only did she have a good time checking out these new Apple products before anyone else she knows \u2014 and yes, I made her sign a strict embargo \u2014 but she and I ended up having a conversation about how much she hates Spotify because even at its best settings, it sounds flat to her compared to Apple Music lossless. That\u2019s my girl. I\u2019m so proud. But, yeah, it is possible to hear a difference. I think it is pretty obvious. For others, it may be more subtle. But it is 100% there. And, frankly, I\u2019ve ditched Spotify almost entirely in favor of Apple Music for audio fidelity reasons alone.\nPerhaps this uncompressed lossless audio is relegated to the pairing of these new AirPods Pro USB-C and an Apple Vision Pro for now, but it won\u2019t be like that forever. The next natural progression of this wireless audio technology is for it to move beyond the confines of the Vision Pro, and into the Mac, the iPhone, and the iPad. It can be done. Apple could do it right now. But knowing Apple, I think it\u2019s going to wait a bit. It\u2019s going to see how things go with Vision Pro, which provides a small test bed of enthusiasts, and it is going to work on how to make it the best possible experience for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users. So, it could be a while. But this is real technology, and it is around right now.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s most exciting to me about these new AirPods Pro USB-C. They can do a lot now, but it looks like they will be able to do even more in the near future. And, I\u2019m here for it. This could be big.\nWorth the upgrade?\nHopefully, at this point you have a feel for whether you really need the new AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C now \u2014 call them the AirPods Pro 2.5, if you must \u2014 or if you\u2019ll be good with your AirPods Pro 2 Lightning for a while.\nIt\u2019s nice to have a choice, for now. Before you know it, only the USB-C version is going to be around. I\u2019d say if you want the latest and greatest, that IP54 and that USB-C, well, here they are!\nBut if all you wanted to do was be able to charge your AirPods with your iPhone 15 and enjoy some of the new audio-processing features? Well, you can do that with what you\u2019ve got, and maybe shouldn\u2019t feel so pressed to spend on the upgrade."

      "text": "When Apple introduced \u201cspatial audio\u201d to Apple Music and the AirPods family, it quickly became a bigger buzzword in audio discussions. In just a few years, it has become ubiquitous.\nThis popularity has led to misconceptions about spatial audio \u2014 what it is, how it works, and why experiencing it is essential. Many ask, \u201cIf Apple created spatial audio, why do other companies claim they have it too?\u201d The truth is that Apple didn\u2019t invent it, and you don\u2019t need to own Apple products to enjoy spatial audio.\nSo, what exactly is spatial audio? How does it compare to familiar terms like surround sound and Dolby Atmos?\nThere\u2019s a lot of ground to cover, and some of it is a bit technical. But we\u2019re going to break it all down in easy-to-understand terms. You\u2019ll be a spatial audio expert in minutes and know exactly how to access this growing trend that is reshaping our experience of music and movies.\nWhat exactly is spatial audio?\nDespite what Apple\u2019s intensive marketing efforts would have you believe, it did not invent spatial audio. It\u2019s a generic term that refers to any audio that has been engineered to have an immersive, 3D quality, with the ability to present sounds in a 360-degree hemisphere around the listener.\nJust like the move from mono to stereo sound required a new format \u2014 one with two channels of sound instead of a single channel \u2014 spatial audio has given rise to new formats. You\u2019ve probably heard of the most popular spatial audio format, Dolby Atmos, but there are others, too, like DTS:X and Sony 360 Reality Audio.\nWith new formats comes new technology. To hear these spatial audio formats, you need access to music or video content created using spatial audio and possibly some new gear built to play spatial audio.\nSources of spatial audio content\nMovies were the first type of content to use spatial audio, and they\u2019re still the most popular. Dolby Atmos movies and TV shows are now widely available on streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Apple TV+, and many more. In some cases, you may need to pay more than the price of a basic subscription to access Dolby Atmos versions of these titles.\nDTS:X has yet to gain widespread use on streaming platforms, but Blu-ray discs often use this spatial audio format, as well as Dolby Atmos.\nMusic is the most recent type of content to adopt spatial audio. It\u2019s been Apple, more than any other company, that has cast itself as head cheerleader for spatial audio in music, which is why you\u2019re probably hearing more about spatial audio now.\nTo access music in spatial audio, you\u2019ll need a subscription to one of the three music services that currently stream in spatial audio formats. Apple Music provides spatial audio in Dolby Atmos Music, while Amazon Music and Tidal support both Dolby Atmos Music and Sony 360 Reality Audio.\nYou can also get Dolby Atmos Music on Blu-ray disc. With its lossless compression, it\u2019s the highest quality version of spatial audio for music. Unfortunately, transferring this content to your phone or other portable devices is difficult and, in many cases, impossible, so Blu-ray disc spatial audio music will remain a home-listening experience for the foreseeable future.\nHow to listen to spatial audio\nYou can listen to spatial audio for both movies and music using speakers or headphones, but there are considerable differences in terms of the gear you need.\nUsing speakers\nSpeaker-based spatial audio requires one of the sources of content we listed above, a device that can decode the spatial audio format you want to listen to, amplification to power the speakers, and the speakers themselves.\nThe good news is that in some cases, you can get all of that in one product. It all depends on how critical you are about sound quality (and how much money you\u2019re willing to spend).\nSpatial audio for movies presents the biggest technical hurdle. For streaming, in addition to a relevant video streaming service subscription, you\u2019ll need a device that is compatible with the service\u2019s app, Dolby Atmos, and critically, Dolby Atmos from your chosen service (yes, sadly there are instances where this isn\u2019t the case.)\nSome of the newest smart TVs meet all of these requirements \u2014 if you\u2019re in this camp, congrats \u2014 that\u2019s one less device you\u2019ll need to buy. For others, a streaming device like an Apple TV 4K is a necessity. Again, Atmos support on the device as well as within your chosen app are the keys to making things work.\nFor disc-based media, you\u2019ll need a Blu-ray player that\u2019s compatible with either Dolby Atmos or DTS:X (preferably both).\nThe next step in the chain is your audio system. Dolby Atmos-capable TVs will theoretically let you hear spatial audio, but the experience tends to be lackluster. Most folks will want something better.\nYour choices are a full home theater system with wired speakers powered by a Dolby Atmos AV receiver or, for a simpler setup, a Dolby Atmos soundbar.\nWhichever way you go, you\u2019ll be able to hear spatial audio for movies and TV shows. You can also listen to spatial audio music with the same caveats: your chosen gear needs to support your streaming service or disc-based media.\nIf you just want to listen to spatial audio music, many powered wireless speakers now work with Dolby Atmos. These include the Apple HomePod, Sonos Era 300, JBL Authentics 500, and Amazon\u2019s Echo Studio.\nBefore you buy, make sure your chosen speaker works with your preferred streaming service \u2014 some models have limited service support.\nUsing headphones or earbuds\nAccessing spatial audio through headphones or earbuds is a very simple process, with some very clever science behind it.\nIf you have an iPhone or an Android smartphone and one of the three spatial audio streaming apps (Apple Music, Tidal, or Amazon Music), you\u2019ll be able to hear spatial audio with any set of stereo headphones or earbuds that work with your device. They can be wired or wireless.\nThe secret to hearing the equivalent of a full 7.1.4 home theater system through a regular set of headphones is a technique known as binaural rendering.\nIf we are blindfolded and someone stands 10 feet away from us and stars clapping, it would barely take us a split second to correctly identify the direction of the sound. We could probably also say with a high degree of accuracy how far away that sound was.\nThat\u2019s because our brains are sensitive to things like volume, pitch, and the slightest variations in the timing of sounds that reach our ears.\nThese audio cues can be faked, thanks to the science of psychoacoustics. With nothing fancier than a set of normal stereo headphones, audio can be generated for each ear that recreates the way our brains perceive real-world sounds.\nUsing the principles of psychoacoustics, binaural rendering takes a spatial audio format like Dolby Atmos and simulates what it would sound like if you were in a studio or home theater equipped with surround sound speakers, including overhead height channel speakers.\nThe Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music apps each include binaural rendering engines, so there\u2019s no need for any additional hardware or software.\nOur heads and our ears play a big part in how we perceive sound. Even the specific shape of our ears can have an effect, which is why Apple and Sony invite you to upload photos of your ears into their apps. With this extra data, binaural rendering can make spatial audio sound more realistic.\nApple calls this \u201cpersonalized spatial audio,\u201d and for now, it\u2019s exclusively supported on AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, AirPods (3rd generation), Beats Fit Pro, or Beats Studio Pro \u2014 plus your iPhone\u2019s front-facing camera needs to support TrueDepth, to get an accurate scan of your ears (iPhone X or newer, not including SE models).\nDo you need access to a spatial audio format like Dolby Atmos to experience spatial audio?\nSome audio products are capable of \u201cupmixing\u201d stereo or other non-spatial audio formats into something that sounds a lot like a true spatial audio format like Dolby Atmos.\nThe feature is less common on smart TVs, but virtually all Dolby Atmos-capable AV receivers and soundbars can use Dolby upmixing any sound source to near-spatial audio quality, using all of your system\u2019s available speakers.\nSome non-Dolby Atmos soundbars have a version of this technology known as DTS Virtual:X, which can do something similar, while some brands combine Dolby\u2019s tech with their own upmixing tech, like Sony\u2019s Immersive AE and Sennheiser\u2019s Ambeo.\nYou\u2019ll also find this capability on select wireless headphones and wireless earbuds. Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and third-gen AirPods have this feature, as does Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, and Ultra Open Earbuds. You\u2019ll also find it on products from Soundcore, Jabra, and 1More, just to name a few.\nWhat about head tracking?\nHead tracking, which was introduced by Apple, embeds a series of motion sensors inside wireless headphones or wireless earbuds to provide you with a heightened sense of spatial audio realism.\nWe noted that headphones-based spatial audio can simulate what it\u2019s like to sit in a 7.1.4-channel home theater. Without head tracking, when you move your head, that entire home theater setup moves with you \u2014 whichever direction you\u2019re currently facing, that\u2019s where the \u201cfront\u201d of the room is.\nWith head tracking, the room (and its \u201cspeakers\u201d) stays anchored in place. Turning your head feels just like it would if you were really in the room. Sounds coming from in front of you (like actors speaking or a lead singer singing) stay fixed in space. Turn to the left, and the sound shifts to your right. Turn right, and the sound moves to the left.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether spatial audio with head tracking improves the music listening experience \u2014 in fact, unless you\u2019re sitting still, it can be very distracting or even disorienting. But the movie-watching experience can be sublime.\nHead tracking works best with a binaurally rendered spatial audio format like Dolby Atmos, but it can be used with upmixed audio content too.\nSpatial audio buying advice: beware the hype\nSpatial audio has become such a big buzzword that companies have started to label their products with the term, especially in the headphone world. This is where some good old-fashioned buyer-beware behavior will save you some frustration.\nThe first thing to remember is that all stereo headphones work with spatial audio music. Your headphones don\u2019t have to say \u201cspatial audio,\u201d \u201cDolby Audio,\u201d or \u201cDolby Atmos.\u201d As long as you have access to spatial audio content through a streaming app on your phone, you don\u2019t need anything else.\nSimilarly, just because a product says it supports spatial audio doesn\u2019t mean it will perform advanced functions like spatial audio upmixing or head tracking. If these features are important to you, read the full specifications and make sure that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting.\nFor instance, Beats says its Beats Studio Buds+ and Beats Fit Pro wireless earbuds support spatial audio. But if you read the full descriptions, they promise very different experiences. The Beats Studio+ \u201csupport spatial audio for immersive music \u2014 delivering a surround sound experience \u2014 that you can take anywhere. It\u2019s like being surrounded by 64 speakers at once.\u201d\nThe Beats Fit Pro \u201csupport Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking for immersive music, movies, and games. Dynamic head tracking uses gyroscopes and accelerometers to adjust the sound as you turn your head, for a multi-dimensional experience that makes you feel like you\u2019re inside of it.\u201d\nSecondly, as fun as spatial audio can be, it\u2019s not for everyone. Especially with headphones or earbuds, I recommend you try out a feature like head tracking before spending more on a product just to get it.\nWhen it comes to soundbars, keep in mind that there can be huge differences in spatial audio performance. A $200, 2.1-channel soundbar may be Dolby Atmos compatible, but it won\u2019t deliver anywhere near the immersive experience you\u2019ll get from a $1,000, 7.1.2-channel soundbar.\nRecent developments in spatial audio\nSpatial audio technology has been advancing rapidly this year, with notable innovations in sound layering and directional audio techniques. These developments create more immersive 3D auditory environments, particularly beneficial for gaming and virtual reality experiences.\nInteractive and adaptive audio systems have reached new heights, with technologies that respond to user actions in real-time and adjust soundscapes based on environmental changes or gameplay situations. For example, systems can now create different acoustic experiences for footsteps depending on the virtual environment (like caves versus forests).\nAMBEO 2-Channel Spatial Audio has become more widely adopted on leading streaming platforms, advancing beyond conventional stereo to deliver immersive spatial experiences even on standard stereo speakers. Some AAA productions have made this the default audio stream for all two-channel uses."

      "text": "Apple AirPods are nestled in ears everywhere you turn, all around the world, and with good reason: they\u2019re the best wireless headphones for iPhone users.\nThanks to their competitive sound quality, seamless usability and genuinely useful Apple-only features, AirPods have snowballed in popularity since their arrival in late 2016 to become the Cupertino giant\u2019s best-selling accessory. Indeed, over 550 million AirPods have been sold in their nine years on this earth, as reported by Digital Music News.\nPicture AirPods and you\u2019re likely envisioning the white, toothbrush-head-shaped earbuds that have become iconic in popular culture, and were fittingly likened to Apple\u2019s wired EarPods\u2026 just with the cables chopped off. Perhaps they are even in your lugholes or within sight while you read this.\nOf them are three current models \u2013 the AirPods 4, AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation, and AirPods Pro 2. But since 2020 the AirPods line has also encompassed an over-ear model, the AirPods Max.\nSo how do the four AirPods models compare in terms of design, features, performance and price, and which \u2013 if any \u2013 is best for you? Here is everything you need to know about the AirPods family\u2026\nWhat are AirPods?\nAirPods is the name for Apple\u2019s four-strong family of wireless earbuds and headphones.\nThey connect wirelessly to phones, tablets and other music source devices over Bluetooth, and while they have features that are exclusive to Apple products (and are therefore recommended to be used with them), they are compatible with Android and other non-Apple devices too.\nWhat are the newest AirPods?\nWhile the first generation of AirPods were announced alongside the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 in September 2016, Apple is now on to its fourth generation of AirPods, and has expanded the line into several earbud models and an over-ear pair.\nThe current iterations are the AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 With ANC, which released in September 2024 (alongside the latest iPhone 16) and saw the discontinuation of the AirPods 2nd Generation and AirPods 3rd Generation.\nYou then have the AirPods Pro 2 \u2013 the latest generation of Apple\u2019s more advanced, flagship AirPods model \u2013 and finally the over-ear AirPods Max, which originally launched in 2020 and were softly updated in 2024.\nOur latest AirPods reviews\nAt Digital Trends, we have reviewed every current AirPods model, awarding each a highly favourable score of 7/10 or over.\nThere are better options out there for Android users in the highly competitive wireless headphones market, but they are ideal for Apple loyals, hence why they feature in both our best wireless headphones and best wireless earbuds expert buying guides.\nOur expert reviews team heralded the AirPods 4 With ANC for offering \u201cthe best ANC on the market for folks who hate eartips\u201d, for example, while we deemed the AirPods Max \u201cdarn-near perfect, with best-in-class noise canceling\u201d.\nYou can read our comprehensive AirPods reviews below:\nThe next AirPods?\nIn nine years, the \u2018standard\u2019 AirPods have had four iterations. Since 2019, the Pro model has had only two. And in nearly five years the Max has had only one (their very light update in 2024 was hardly a \u2018next-gen\u2019 refresh).\nConsidering the latest AirPods 4 models launched only late last year, we aren\u2019t expecting an AirPods 5 model anytime soon, with the typical AirPods release cycle suggesting they could arrive in 2027.\nThe next Pros, however, are likely due a refresh much sooner \u2013 the AirPods Pro 3 rumor mill has been churning for months now, and they could appear as soon as next month (September 2025), alongside the anticipated iPhone 17.\nIf that\u2019s the case, the 2022-released AirPods Pro 2 (which did move from a Lightning to a USB-C port in 2023) will probably be discontinued by the end of this year.\nHopes were high that Apple would launch a second-gen Max last year with some of our AirPods Max 2 wishlist updates, but somewhat disappointingly Apple chose to simply bless them with only a USB-C port and sprinkle of new colourways.\nEvery AirPods model explained\nWhile there are three earbuds in the current AirPods lineup (two of which share very similar names!), they are all, as you might expect, pretty different to one another when it comes to features, price and sound performance. Let\u2019s break them down\u2026\nAirPods 4\nSure, you can still pick up refurbished pairs of the previous-gen AirPods 3 and AirPods 2, but the AirPods 4 are the cheapest of the current models. They cost $129 (although are sometimes discounted under $100) and are now the only AirPods without active noise cancellation technology.\nStill, they boast many of the attractive design elements and features we\u2019ve come to expect from AirPods. That iconic, white, semi-open-ear (read: eartip-less) design with intuitive and tactile pinch controls is very familiar, simply with slightly thicker stems and a slightly thinner in-ear profile compared to those of their predecessors.\nA slightly smaller charging case with a USB-C port this time round can recharge the earbuds\u2019 five-hour battery life five times before requiring a charge itself. And spatial audio returns to offer a more three-dimensional soundstage for those who like its somewhat hit-and-miss effect.\nThe AirPods 4 sound great too, even if that semi-open-ear design lets external sounds creep in in noisy environments, and call quality is solid.\nOur AirPods 4 review concluded that they are \u201ca no-brainer purchase\u2026 they\u2019ll work seamlessly with all of your Apple devices, they\u2019re comfortable, and if you must have a set of semi-open earbuds, they provide very good sound and call quality.\u201d\nAirPods 4 with ANC\nThe AirPods 4 with ANC are essentially very similar to the AirPods 4, but they have active noise cancellation technology, a case that supports wireless charging, and naturally a higher price ($179).\nThey look, sound and pretty much do the same as the AirPods 4 in most respects, but that ANC functionality is a huge benefit and marks the first time Apple has put ANC into a non-Pro model.\nAs our AirPods 4 with ANC review states, the ANC effect is very impressive \u2013 not least when you consider the very limited passive isolation provided by the absence of an eartip. \u201cI was walking down the street in a small business district listening to music at a pretty healthy volume, and I didn\u2019t hear much of anything but the music, save for the nasal sound of some of the louder voices around me,\u201d noted our review expert.\nThat the ANC automatically adjusts to your surroundings and that the Transparency Mode (which purposely lets sound in so you can hear, say, a train announcement) works well are also notable bonuses.\nJust note that it has an effect on the battery life, bringing the earbud and total figures down to four and 20 hours respectively.\nAirPods Pro 2\nThe Pro 2 aren\u2019t the only AirPods with ANC anymore, then. So what stands them apart from the AirPods 4 with ANC? A fair bit actually.\nAs detailed in our AirPods Pro 2 vs AirPods 4 With ANC comparison, the flagship model has an ever-so-slightly bigger and heavier design with eartips, more effective ANC thanks to the added isolation those eartips provide, a slightly better earbud battery life (six hours), an on-bud volume touch control slider, a MagSafe wireless charging case, and the addition of an AirPods hearing test and aid features.\nThey also sound superior to the AirPods 4 models, and in our AirPods Pro 2 review we also praised the accuracy of the skin-sensing wear sensors, which ensure features like automatic music pausing work as they should.\nThe Pro 2\u2019s RRP is higher because of all those extras ($249), although because the model is older it can often be picked up for a similar price as the new AirPods 4 With ANC.\nAirPods Max\nNaturally, the biggest difference between the AirPods Max and their siblings is their over-ear design. They are also by far the most expensive AirPods model, with an RRP of $549.\nThese are premium-priced wireless headphones with suitably premium (\u201cunmatched\u201d, we said in our AirPods Max review) build quality and some of the best all-round ANC and sound performance this lofty end of the market offers.\nThat said, the Max share many of their earbud family members\u2019 features, including noise-canceling, spatial audio and a USB-C connection.\nAnd their USPs within the AirPods line include support of lossless audio (via USB\u2011C cable), a smart case that puts the headphones into a low-power mode to conserve battery, a tactile digital crown control that we called \u201cextremely accurate and granular\u201d, and a range of fresh finishes that bring a splash of colour to the AirPods line. If only the Max had a battery life better than their measly 20 hours\u2026\nWhich AirPods should I buy?\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious that if you want the more immersive over-ear design and have the cash to splash, the Max are the AirPods you should chuck in your basket.\nThey may be expensive, but they justify their price in the over-ear headphones market for Apple device owners with their best-in-class noise-canceling, competitive sound quality and luxury build.\nIf you\u2019re after in-ear earbuds, however, your choice isn\u2019t quite as straightforward. Price might dictate that you buy the \u2018standard\u2019 AirPods 4, and indeed they will serve most Apple users absolutely fine so long as they can get on with their semi-open-ear design.\nIf noise-cancelation is a must-have feature, though, we would recommend buying the AirPods Pro 2, which offer plenty of advantages over the AirPods 4 with ANC while, nowadays, not costing much (if anything) more."

      "text": "- Small and comfortable\n- Top-notch sound\n- Excellent noise canceling\n- Superb call quality\n- Bluetooth multipoint with LDAC\n- Fit isn't super secure\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nSony\u2019s latest flagship wireless earbuds, the WF-1000XM5, are 25% smaller than their predecessors. Why am I throwing that out there? Because it\u2019s really hard to find any faults with the XM5 predecessor \u2014 the WF-1000XM4 \u2014 except their size and shape. For a lot of folks, the XM4 were just too big for a comfortable fit.\nSo right off the bat, the new XM5 have accomplished what might be their most important mission (assuming that their smaller size actually translates into better comfort).\nSony also claims the XM5 have incremental improvements to sound, noise cancellation, and call quality. Oh, and there\u2019s also one more incremental change: At $300, the Buy at Amazon are Sony\u2019s most expensive wireless earbuds to date.\nAre the WF-1000XM5 as good in real life as they look on paper? I spent a week with them to find out.\nEditor\u2019s note:\nOur original review of the XM5, which we published on July 24, 2023, wasn\u2019t a reflection of the earbuds that you\u2019ll get if you buy them from Sony or one of its retail partners. That\u2019s because we were sent prototypes to try, not full production units. Those prototypes suffered from several weaknesses, specifically in areas like noise cancellation, call quality, and Bluetooth connections. Sony has since provided us with final factory editions and this review now reflects our opinion of the product that Sony is shipping to customers.\nVideo review\nSony WF-1000XM5: smaller, sleeker\nThe WF-1000XM5 aren\u2019t just smaller than the XM4, they\u2019re 20% lighter and way more streamlined. That goes for the earbuds as well as the wirelessly-charging case, which has also been given a more rounded, lozenge-like shape which is a lot more pocket-friendly.\nLooks are a subjective thing, but I don\u2019t think anyone was especially taken with the XM4\u2019s bulky, bulbous shape and gold-tone microphone ports, except to say they were a bit better looking than the XM3 model that came before them.\nThe XM5, on the other hand, are small, smooth, and elegant. The microphone port is still there, and it\u2019s still gold-toned, but it now sits flush with the earbud body where it looks more like an inlaid gold accent than a functional part of the device. You could wear these things to a black-tie event and not look out of place.\nPart of the appeal is the glossy piano black (or the beigy color that Sony insists on calling \u201csilver\u201d) finish of the main body, which blends seamlessly \u2014 there are literally no visible seams \u2014 into the matte finish of the touch surface.\nHowever, as good as it looks, that glossy finish is so slippery that it\u2019s easy to lose your grip while handling them. Chris Welch at The Verge found them hard to remove from their case, but there is a trick to make it easier: use your thumbs to push them to the sides and they\u2019ll pop right out.\nSony WF-1000XM5: comfort and fit\nAre they more comfortable than the XM4? For me, the answer is yes. The combination of smooth plastic and smaller size makes for a less fatiguing fit. Sony has also redesigned the foam eartips to be more forgiving and there are four sizes to choose from instead of three \u2014 an extra small size has been added.\nBut the XM5 do not sit as securely as the XM4 or Sony\u2019s LinkBuds S, which could limit the appeal of the XM5 for running or gym use, even though they have an IPX4 rating for water and sweat resistance. The glossy finish provides a lot less grip on the skin of your ear and the horn (the part that\u2019s covered in the foam eartip) doesn\u2019t stick out from the earbud body as far as it does on the XM4. This limits how deeply you can insert the earbuds and thus limits the amount of contact the foam sleeve has with your ear canal.\nLet me caveat this by saying I have deeply set ear canals, and the XM5 aren\u2019t the first earbuds I\u2019ve worn that feel like I can\u2019t get them into my ears as far as I\u2019d like. If you\u2019re in the opposite camp, and routinely have trouble getting earbuds to sit fully in your ears, this could be very good news.\nIt hasn\u2019t been a deal-breaker for me. While I have had to nudge them in more than I\u2019d like \u2014 even with the largest tips installed \u2014 overall I prefer the comfort of the XM5 over the secure fit of the XM4.\nNew for the XM5 are built-in accelerometers, which enable the same kind of head-tracked spatial audio that Apple has added to select AirPods models. (More on that in a moment). Sony has taken advantage of the accelerometers to incorporate head movement control gestures. They\u2019re rudimentary but work like a charm: you can nod your head to accept an incoming call or decline it by shaking your head. In theory, Sony could give you more gestures and more actions \u2014 Klipsch\u2019s T5 II ANC uses dedicated software from Bragi to do this \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath on that.\nSony WF-1000XM5: ANC and transparency\nFor the XM5, Sony has moved from a single processor (its V1 which was used on the XM4) to a dual processor platform made up of its new V2 Integrated Processor plus its latest dedicated chip for noise cancellation \u2014 the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN2e. Sony says that by running these devices in tandem, along with the XM5\u2019s six onboard microphones, and the XM5\u2019s redesigned drivers, it can achieve better ANC performance across all but the highest frequencies when compared to the XM4.\nI found that to be true \u2014 the XM4 was no slouch in the ANC department, but the XM5 is better. Not radically better, however. If I had to put a number on it, I\u2019d say 10% to 15% better, though you may find there are certain times and places when it\u2019s more noticeable, especially if you\u2019re battling with very low frequencies. Another area of strength is the XM5\u2019s ability to deal with wind noise while in ANC mode. Wind can often undermine ANC performance \u2014 my recent experience with the Beats Studio Pro was a reminder of that. The XM5 seem utterly unaffected by wind.\nFor day-to-day situations, I found them to be just as capable as Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro 2 ($249) and the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II ($299). But the XM5 are more persnickety. To get the same level of ANC performance, you\u2019ll have to use the set of included eartips that provide the very best seal and even then, you\u2019ll need to ensure they are twisted into your ear as deeply as is comfortably possible.\nOnly once I had done that was I able to get the XM5 to match the Bose and Apple earbuds in my totally unscientific bathroom fan test \u2014 where I stand outside my bathroom and listen to how earbuds cancel the fan noise. The Headphones app provides a fit test \u2014 it can help you find the best-fitting ear tips, but think of the results as a suggestion, not the gospel, on which tips will work best for you.\nSimilar things can be said of the XM5\u2019s transparency mode. It offers a more natural sound when piping in the outside world than the XM4, but even with its optional voice-targeting mode, it can\u2019t quite meet the exceptionally high bar set by the AirPods Pro 2. Sony has improved the transition time between ANC and transparency modes, although curiously, it\u2019s faster at switching from transparency to ANC than vice versa.\nAs with the XM4, the XM5\u2019s speak-to-chat option can detect when you start speaking and shift automatically from ANC to transparency, while simultaneously pausing your music \u2014 a handy feature. It takes a second to kick in, but it seemed to be very consistent in detecting my voice. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not very aware of the XM5\u2019s status \u2014 if you\u2019re already in transparency mode with your music paused, speak-to-chat still emits an audible ping when you talk to let you know that it has registered you\u2019re speaking, with a follow-up chime after a predetermined interval once you\u2019ve stopped speaking, which is pretty annoying given that is hasn\u2019t actually done anything.\nI wish Sony had taken a page from Apple\u2019s transparency playbook. The AirPods Pro 2 have a feature called Adaptive Transparency, which constantly monitors your environment for loud noises when you\u2019re in Transparency mode. If a sound is judged to be dangerously loud, it kicks you into ANC mode instantly to protect your hearing. Given the additional processing power Sony has given the XM5, I\u2019d like to think they could manage this trick, too.\nSony WF-1000XM5: call and voice quality\nSony claims its new dual processor platform also gives the XM5 a leg up when it comes to call quality. Beyond the six mics, there\u2019s also a bone conduction sensor in each bud that feeds your voice vibrations into an AI algorithm, which Sony says has been trained on 500 million voice samples \u2014 with the goal of separating your voice from background sounds.\nThat\u2019s a lot of tech to throw at call quality, but it seems to have paid off. Digital Trends\u2019 Editor-at-large Caleb Denison (who also received a set of XM5) and I conducted a series of phone calls using both the XM5 and the AirPods Pro Gen 2, which we both consider to be super for calls.\nWhat we discovered impressed us. The WF-1000XM5 are incredibly good at masking all of the background sounds that would normally steal the focus away from your voice. Traffic, construction, and even very blustery wind were all erased to the point where there was no audible trace on the other end of the call.\nAt times, your voice does take a bit of a hit \u2014 when a background sound is really loud, it can greatly reduce the volume of your voice too. There\u2019s also a bit of compression that can smear some of the finer details. But overall, the XM5 deliver your voice with greater dynamic range than the AirPods Pro. That\u2019s good for outdoor calls and great for indoor calls, where the built-in mics really shine.\nSony WF-1000XM5: sound quality\nThe XM5\u2019s drivers have been significantly redesigned from the XM4 \u2014 they\u2019re 40% bigger at 8.4mm (vs 6mm) and they sport a new shape. Sony calls it Dynamic Driver X \u2014 a dome-edge separation structure that combines different materials (though Sony hasn\u2019t indicated what those materials are). It\u2019s designed to reduce distortion while improving both vocal clarity and low-frequency response.\nSony has never disappointed us when it comes to sound quality, and the XM5 are superb, with a sound signature that can best be described as a small but still noticeable enhancement of the XM4\u2019s performance. Bass response, which has always been a Sony strength, is deeply resonant and musical but now feels better balanced with the rest of the frequencies.\nThrough a variety of genres from hard rock to jazz, these earbuds kept individual elements distinct from each other. Even on a track like Zeal by Bill Laurance, where the many layers of synth, strings, and percussion, proved too complex for the Buy at Amazon , the XM5 managed to keep things organized and intelligible. When using Sony\u2019s LDAC Bluetooth codec (Android only), detail and dynamic range \u2014 especially with lossless hi-res audio sources \u2014 were further improved.\nVocals are crystal clear, but despite the presence of those new drivers, I\u2019m not sure the XM5 deliver a better high-end than the XM4. On some tracks, like Camila Cabello\u2019s Bam Bam, I actually preferred the XM4\u2019s treatment, which sounded a little less processed. But I\u2019m really splitting hairs here \u2014 they both sound great.\nThe soundstage has excellent detail and precision, but as we\u2019ve noticed with both Sony headphones and earbuds, it\u2019s a stage that doesn\u2019t expand very far outside your head \u2014 most of the sound is concentrated within a small circle. That\u2019s when listening to normal stereo. 3D formats, like Sony 360 Reality Audio (360RA) and Dolby Atmos offer a much wider performance, with 360RA benefitting the most.\nSony has also thrown in a beta version of its sound personalization system called Find Your Equalizer. You pick a song to listen to and the feature walks you through a series of three EQ modifications. With each step, you pick your favorite mod from among a few numbered options, and each of those choices leads to further refinements. In the end, the system saves your EQ settings as a custom preset within the Headphones app\u2019s equalizer section, where you can modify it or turn it on and off. I wasn\u2019t wild about the sound signature it created, which seemed to significantly de-emphasize the highest frequencies, but it\u2019s a fun tool to mess around with if you\u2019re not keen on moving individual EQ sliders around.\nSony WF-1000XM5: spatial audio\nYes, the XM5 support head-tracked spatial audio, but for now it\u2019s limited to just a few situations. I couldn\u2019t get it working with any Dolby Atmos Music sources like Amazon Music or Apple Music, but it did work when watching Netflix on a Google Pixel 7 Pro. The key is that the phone itself has to support head-tracking, which ruled out my other two test phones, an iPhone 14 and a Xiaomi 12 Pro. Sony tells me that it will also work with immersive games like Niantic\u2019s Ingress when the feature is added later this year.\nWhile watching The Batman, I was able to move my head and some parts of the soundtrack remained anchored to the location of the phone. However, it\u2019s not as smooth or convincing as Apple\u2019s version of head-tracked spatial on the AirPods Pro Gen 2.\nSony WF-1000XM5: Bluetooth Multipoint\nBluetooth 5.3, connections on the WF-1000XM5 were solid, with about average range for wireless earbuds \u2014 you\u2019ll get approximately 25 feet indoors, and up to 45 feet outside with no obstructions.\nI quickly and easily paired two devices at once, including a MacBook Air and a Google Pixel 7 Pro. I really like that Sony gives you two ways to put the XM5 into pairing mode: if you remove the earbuds and place them in their case, you can use the small button on the back of the charging case, or, you can use the Headphones app, which will initiate pairing while you\u2019re wearing the earbuds. Either way, pairing is fast and easy, especially if you have an Android device \u2014 Google Fast Pair works like a charm.\nUnlike the Technics EAH-AZ80 and some other earbuds that support LDAC, you don\u2019t need to choose between Bluetooth Multipoint and LDAC use \u2014 they can be used simultaneously. Better yet, switching between connected devices was seamless for me.\nSony tells me the XM5 will support LE Audio, including Auracast and music sharing, but I wasn\u2019t able to test these features.\nSony WF-1000XM5: controls\nThe WF-1000XM5, like many earbuds, use touch controls instead of physical buttons. They\u2019re very accurate and easy to use, and Sony\u2019s use of a short tone when you successfully tap gets rid of any doubt \u2014 if you don\u2019t hear the tone, tap again. Sony has also made an effort to improve the availability of functions. On the XM4, you were forced to choose between different control groups, which meant that if you wanted to be able to adjust the volume (for example) you might have to live without voice assistant access.\nSony\u2019s solution has been to add volume control access as an always-on feature. That makes a lot of sense. What doesn\u2019t make much sense (to me, at least) is that volume changes are now accomplished by tapping each earbud four times \u2014 the right earbud raises the volume and the left lowers it. Four taps for a high-use feature like volume is excessive and kind of awkward.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no way to change any of the gestures. The only customization available within the Sony Headphones app is whether you want to assign ANC functions to the left or right earbud (or you can decide to ignore ANC entirely and use both earbuds for playback control). To be fair, neither Apple nor Bose offers much customization either, but I prefer the way those earbuds manage volume changes.\nAn extension of these controls is Sony\u2019s auto-pause feature, which is enabled by the XM5\u2019s wear sensors. Pop an earbud out to pause your tunes; pop it back in to resume. It works really well, but you also can disable it in the app if it bugs you. In the same vein is the auto-off feature, which will power down the earbuds if you\u2019re not wearing them but forget to put them back in the case (this can also be disabled).\nSony WF-1000XM5: battery life\nBattery life is unchanged from WF-1000XM4: Sony claims you\u2019ll get eight hours of playtime per charge when ANC is turned on, and up to 12 hours when it\u2019s off. With two full charges in the case, that means that if you keep volume no higher than 50%, you may be able to get up to 36 hours of total time before you need to charge up. But Sony has managed to improve the XM5\u2019s quick-charge feature once again. You now only need to stick the earbuds in their case for three minutes to grab an extra hour of playtime \u2014 that\u2019s one of the fastest quick-charge times we\u2019ve seen so far.\nOne thing that Sony has changed from the WF-1000XM4 is the amount of voice guidance you get. Popping the XM4 into your ears triggers two pieces of feedback: the first message tells you the remaining battery life and the second lets you know that the earbuds have successfully connected to one device (or two, if using Multipoint). I could do without the second message, but I really liked hearing \u201cbattery fully charged\u201d (or whatever the level is at). Unfortunately, these messages have been removed \u2014 now you get a tone for connection (followed by a double-tone if a second device connects), but that\u2019s it.\nIt\u2019s evident from the time I\u2019ve spent with the WF-1000XM5 that Sony has developed a fantastic set of wireless earbuds. When it comes to sound quality and noise cancellation, I can safely say you won\u2019t find better, even if you spend more. Their call quality is among the best, they\u2019re absolutely loaded with the latest features, and the only area where Apple remains on top is transparency.\nThey\u2019re also much more comfortable than the XM4. For anyone who wanted to buy the XM4, but couldn\u2019t because they were just too big, the XM5 are absolutely worth a try \u2014 even with the extra $20 tacked onto the price.\nIf you\u2019re content with the XM4\u2019s fit, I don\u2019t think you need to rush out and upgrade to the XM5. There\u2019s no doubt that Sony has found plenty of ways to improve, but for the most part, they\u2019re small improvements. In fact, now that the XM4 is no longer the newest kid on the block, you can expect some pretty decent discounts, which will make the XM4 even more attractive."

Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nIt\u2019s been nearly three years since Sony launched its current flagship noise-canceling wireless headphones, the WH-1000XM5. In that time, the landscape has changed considerably, with new versions from top competitors like Bose, Apple, JBL, and Sennheiser, plus several new wireless cans aimed at the highly discerning audiophile segment, from brands like Focal, Dali, and Bowers & Wilkins. Even Sonos has now joined the fray, with the launch of the Sonos Ace.\nWe\u2019ve also seen a huge uptick in trends such as spatial audio and lossless audio, largely thanks to Apple\u2019s marketing muscle and its Apple Music streaming service.\nSo does that mean the WH-1000XM5 are now has-beens? Far from it. They may be missing a few modern bells and whistles, but the XM5 remain the best overall headphones you can buy. Here\u2019s why I think so.\nVideo review\nThe best box\nBefore we get right into it, first a quick shout out to the folks responsible for Sony\u2019s packaging. The XM5 come in the same ultra-recyclable plain cardboard containers that the company pioneered with the WF-1000XM4 wireless earbuds. You won\u2019t find a trace of plastic anywhere, and while buying consumer electronics might not be the best thing for the planet, at least you won\u2019t be adding to your local landfill when you unbox your new cans.\nAs for what\u2019s in that enviro-friendly box: You get the headphones, packed in a zippered carry case. The case has a magnetically closed compartment, where you\u2019ll find the analog cable and, once again, a comically short USB A-to-USB-C charging cable. Wondering about an airplane adapter? Sony has apparently decided that if you still really need one, there are plenty on Amazon you can buy.\nWhere have we seen this design before?\nThe XM5 took its design inspiration from Bose\u2019s $399 Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, and Apple\u2019s $549 AirPods Max. Those cans fold flat, but they don\u2019t fold up. What they lose in portability, they gain in elegance \u2014 single points of contact from the headband to the earcups makes for a sleek, sophisticated look.\nSony\u2019s interpretation of this style uses one-piece tubular sliders that terminate in pivots hidden within the earcup housings. The XM5 keep their predecessor\u2019s slightly rubberized, matte-finish in a choice of black or what Sony calls \u201csilver\u201d (it\u2019s actually more a sand color), but use a sightly narrower headband.\nIronically, not long after Sony adopted the fold-flat approach for the XM5, Bose abandoned it when it debuted the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in 2023, returning to the older fold-flat/fold-up architecture of its previous models.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why. The one downside to Sony\u2019s move into modernity is that they take up more room in a backpack or purse. The included travel case is much larger than the one you get with the WH-1000XM4. When sitting around your neck, the earcups face \u201cup\u201d with the hard plastic of the outer shells resting against your collarbones instead of the ear cushions.\nAs it turns out, that sleek, single point of contact between the headband and the earcups is something of an Achilles\u2019 Heel. Reddit and other online forums contain plenty of stories of broken XM5 hinges. My review sample is still in one piece after 35 months, but it\u2019s spent most of its life indoors.\nComfort, controls, and connections\nMost of its life, but not all. I have taken the XM5 on nearly every flight, from short hops between Toronto and New York City to punishingly long hauls like Toronto to Tokyo. Despite the lack of a fold-up hinge, I can slide them in front of my laptop, where their low-profile manages to take up very little room.\nThey\u2019re also impressively comfortable. The XM5 are a teensiest bit lighter than the XM4, clocking in at 8.81 ounces vs. the XM4\u2019s 8.95 ounces. That doesn\u2019t sound like much \u2014 and it isn\u2019t \u2014 but, amazingly enough, you can feel it. I\u2019ll be darned if Sony hasn\u2019t managed to make the XM5 even more comfortable than the already excellent XM4, despite the narrower headband. Part of the reason is balance \u2014 the XM5 feel like they distribute their weight better. Another factor is the new ear cushion design, which is at once lower profile (which helps to keep the mass of the earcups closer to your head) and yet just as cushy.\nThese are all good things. But you may find \u2014 especially if your noggin is as small as mine \u2014 that the XM5\u2019s clamping force isn\u2019t as strong as the XM4. It\u2019s not a problem for casual use, but if you like to be active in your headphones (something Sony specifically discourages on the attached warning label that features a big \u201cno\u201d sign over an image of a man sweating), you\u2019ll notice that the XM5 move around a bit more.\nMy only note on comfort is that the headband will, over time, cause some pressure on the top of your head.\nThe XM5\u2019s controls are identical to the XM4: Two dedicated power/Bluetooth and ANC/multifunction buttons on the left earcup, and a touch-sensitive panel on the outer surface of the right earcup. They\u2019re easy, accurate, and intuitive to use, and Sony has kept the awesome quick-attention feature which instantly replaces ANC with transparency mode when you cover the right earcup with your hand. The built-in wear sensor gives you fast and responsive auto-pause and resume for music, and it can be disabled in the app if you don\u2019t need it.\nAs for music genres, take your pick. There aren\u2019t any that won\u2019t be an absolute joy to listen to.\nI still find the long-press on the power button an unintuitive way to turn the cans on, but it\u2019s hard to deny that buttons are likely to last longer than mechanical switches over the long term. Sony has replaced some of the XM4\u2019s spoken voice prompts with short audible tones. It allows for fast transitions (especially between ANC modes) but I still find the tones harder to decipher than voice prompts.\nThe XM5 are equipped with Bluetooth 5.2, and as you\u2019d expect, the wireless connection is rock-solid all the way up to its theoretical 32-foot range. With Google Fast Pair, they set up on Android devices in a flash, and even on an iPhone it\u2019s pretty easy. You get Bluetooth multipoint for simultaneous connections to a phone and a computer (or any other two Bluetooth devices), but it\u2019s worth noting that if you want that phone connection to use Sony\u2019s LDAC codec \u2014 the highest quality wireless link you can get \u2014 you\u2019ll need to forego the second device. Apparently LDAC and multipoint are mutually exclusive.\nSound quality\nIt\u2019s unusual for a premium set of headphones to boast smaller drivers than its predecessor, but that\u2019s what Sony decided to do. The XM5 are equipped with carbon-fiber-based 30mm dynamic transducers which are 25% smaller than the ones used in the XM4. The change allows for the lower weight of the XM5, but Sony claims they sound better, too. And I agree. Mostly.\nNo beating around the bush: The WH-1000XM5 are the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy right now.\nIt all depends on how you define \u201cbetter.\u201d There\u2019s no question in my mind that the XM5 exhibit greater subtlety and finer details, and the frequencies are beautifully balanced. At the same time, bass response is expertly managed, with a low end that does what low ends should do: Provide the thump, groove, and resonance that completes the musical picture, without dominating the other frequencies. The soundstage is open and airy and has the kind of precision that lets you build a map of the players and their instruments in your mind\u2019s eye.\nAs for music genres, take your pick. I can\u2019t think of any that won\u2019t be an absolute joy to listen to. In short, they sound fantastic, especially when you engage the LDAC codec (Android only, sorry Apple users) and feed these cans high-quality content from Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, or your own ripped music.\nBut (you knew there was a \u201cbut \u2026\u201d coming), in delivering such a detailed and nuanced performance, Sony has taken a bit of a step back from the WH-1000XM4\u2019s power and bass-forward signature. Like the drivers inside them, these two great headphones deliver two different sonic experiences. The XM5 will appeal most to those who seek a more neutral sound and who may have found Sony\u2019s previous efforts too bombastic, while the XM4 continue to be the right choice for folks who like their tunes with a little extra punch.\nAs always, the Sony Headphones app gives you full manual EQ control should you wish to alter the factory tuning, and Sony provides several useful presets along with an independent bass boost adjustment. I like the default settings so much, I left these tweaks alone.\nOn the connectivity side of the listening experience, it\u2019s worth noting that you can\u2019t use the headphones on a dead battery, even if you\u2019re connected via the analog cable. You should also know that the XM5 don\u2019t support USB Audio, so if you want a way to listen to truly lossless digital music, you\u2019ll need to use an external DAC/amp with the analog cable.\nNoise canceling and transparency\nWhen they debuted, the WH-1000XM5 were the best noise-canceling headphones you could buy. They\u2019re still superb, but now they\u2019re in second place. Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Ultra Headphones enjoy a small but noticeable lead in that department.\nPractically speaking, the eight-mic arrangement and dual-chip processing \u2014 which enables real-time adaptive changes \u2014 does everything you need it to do. The XM5 doesn\u2019t just reduce some external noises \u2014 it erases them.\nThe degree to which the on-board processors are able to separate your voice from background noise is remarkable.\nSony says it\u2019s especially helpful for dealing with voices, like the din in a coffee shop or restaurant, but I found it worked in almost every scenario I tried. The roar of a turboprop airplane engine was reduced to a whisper; Manhattan\u2019s signature mix of traffic, construction, loud voices, and perpetual car horns were diminished to the point where my nerves weren\u2019t frayed (my hometown of Toronto isn\u2019t exactly quiet, but c\u2019mon, nothing else is NYC). And these were the benefits when I wasn\u2019t playing any music at all. Add some tunes \u2014 even at moderate volumes \u2014 and you might just convince yourself those external sounds aren\u2019t there at all.\nSony has automated the process of optimizing ANC on the XM5, so if you change the way you wear the headphones (adding or removing eyeglasses; changing hairstyles) or there\u2019s an alteration in atmospheric pressure, there\u2019s nothing you need to do. I\u2019ve read some criticisms of Sony\u2019s adaptive ANC algorithm, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever had a bad experience.\nI\u2019m much less enthusiastic about the optional activity and location tracking in the Sony Connect app, which tries to make changes to ANC and transparency as you switch up your day from sitting to walking to running, etc. It never seems to get this mix right.\nTransparency mode is also excellent, though if there\u2019s one area where Apple maintains a slight edge, this is it. You\u2019ll have an easy time hearing everything that matters, and the optional voice-enhancement mode does exactly what it purports to do. But somehow, the AirPods Max manage to convince you you\u2019re not wearing headphones \u2014 something the XM5 fall just shy of achieving.\nSwitching between the two modes is fast and easy, whether you use the dedicated button for longer periods or the quick-attention gesture for short interactions.\nCall quality\nThis is another area where the XM5 handily outshines its predecessor and almost every other competitor. The degree to which the on-board processors are able to separate your voice from background noise \u2014 even when it\u2019s very loud \u2014 is remarkable. They pull this off without the compression and muddiness that often accompanies this kind of algorithmic magic, and there\u2019s only the slightest hint of harshness when the system is pushed to its limits.\nFormer Digital Trends Editor-at-large, Caleb Denison and I both recorded voice samples in busy urban locations and we both experienced the same thing: Sounds that were super intrusive on our end, were seemingly non-existent when we listened to the recordings. Meanwhile, our voices sounded natural, with a pleasant, warm, tone.\nThere\u2019s only one other set of headphones that are better for calls: the JBL Tour One M3.\nBattery life\nSony claims 30 hours of continuous playback with ANC on, and 40 hours when it\u2019s off. From what I can tell, those numbers seem bang-on accurate. Sony doesn\u2019t indicate how much of a hit these numbers will take when using LDAC, but based on my experience, you can expect it to eat up to 40%.\nEither way, these stats are more than adequate for even the longest of flights. However, if you happen to own a USB Power Delivery (PD) charger, you\u2019ll be able to quick-charge the XM5 with an extra three hours of playtime in a ludicrously fast three minutes. Yes, one minute equals one hour.\nConclusion\nAt $400, Sony\u2019s best noise-canceling headphones cost the same or less than newer models from Bose, Apple, Sonos, and JBL. Their advanced age means they lack a few features we\u2019ve started to get used to, like spatial audio, USB Audio, and support for Auracast, and they\u2019re all things we\u2019d like to see in the WH-1000XM6.\nBut despite these omissions, the WH-1000XM5 remain the best all-around noise canceling cans for most people. Because when it comes to sound quality, comfort, call quality, ANC, and battery life \u2014 the essential ingredients we want from these devices \u2014 the XM5 are still outstanding.\nYou can now find wireless cans with better sound quality: Mark Levinson\u2019s No 5909, Dali\u2019s IO-12, Master & Dynamic\u2019s MW75, and Focal\u2019s Bathys are all good examples. However, you\u2019ll pay a lot more for these headphones, while sacrificing Sony\u2019s lightweight comfort, ANC, and call quality.\nThe one weakness that has become apparent over time is Sony\u2019s choice of materials for the rotating hinge that connects the XM5\u2019s headband to the earcups. It just isn\u2019t robust enough to withstand heavy use. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a reason to avoid them, but it\u2019s definitely a reason to handle them with a little extra care."

      "text": "\u201cThe Sony WF-C510 earbuds pump out great sound at a wallet-friendly price.\u201d\n- Good for smaller ears\n- Great value in terms of sound quality\n- Effective passive isolation\n- Good app support\n- More pocket-friendly case\n- More affordable price\n- No noise cancellation\n- No wireless charging\n- Limited options for onboard controls\n- Phone calls are tough in louder settings\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nSony knows how to make good earbuds, as evidenced by its flagship WF-1000XM5 that is top of the class in just about every respect. It can also deliver value for less money to stand out as an alternative in terms of both comfort and performance. The $60 WF-C510 attempt to do just that, relying on Sony\u2019s audio pedigree and the customizability in the Sound Connect app in a smaller package than ever.\nThe WF-C510 is the successor to the WF-C500, a pair of earbuds that followed the company\u2019s Road to Zero initiative to achieve a zero environmental footprint. To get there, Sony had to cut plenty out. Now that there\u2019s a sequel, did it manage to take a little more off the top without sacrificing functionality and performance? Let\u2019s see.\nWith the case that\u2019s about a third smaller (still without wireless charging, unfortunately) and earbuds that have shaved off some girth, the WF-C510 look more refined out of the box. Sony doesn\u2019t quantify exact figures on how much smaller they are, but the difference was obvious when I put them side by side.\nSony says it used \u201cextensive ear shape data\u201d to ensure comfort for most people through a rounded design and matte finish. I would say they succeeded in improving on the WF-C500 in that regard for a couple reasons. First, the newer WF-C510 have elongated necks due to the reduced size of the earbud module. This makes them easier to not only place in your ear and rest on the concha, but also to maintain a tighter seal. Second, the weight distribution just feels different. The WF-C500 feel like they take up more space, with most of the weight falling onto the part that sticks out most. That hasn\u2019t been the case for me wearing the C510s.\nI\u2019m confident those with smaller ears will appreciate how Sony slimmed things down here. It\u2019s part of a broader trend for its earbuds, most of which used to look bulky, but are becoming more svelte and contoured these days.\nThe specs\n| Price | $60 |\n| Weight | 0.16 ounce each, charging case: 1.09 oz |\n| Form factor | Closed earbuds |\n| Noise cancellation | No |\n| Battery life | 11 hours, 22 hours total with charging case |\n| Charging | USB-C |\n| Voice assistant | Native smaratphone access |\n| Multipoint | Yes |\n| Water/dust resistance | IPX4 (earbuds only) |\n| Hi-res audio | No |\n| Fast pairing | Google Fast Pair, Swift Pair |\n| Bluetooth/codecs | BT 5.3 with AAC and SBC |\n| Auracast | No |\nGetting the sizing right is all the more important for earbuds that don\u2019t have any active noise cancellation (ANC). A stable and effective passive seal can do a good job ensuring you don\u2019t have to blast your tunes to hear them, though the lack of noise cancellation can be tough when you find yourself dealing with all sorts of loud background noise.\nSony still includes Ambient Sound Control via the Sony Connect app on iOS or Android. It\u2019s a mode with a sliding scale from 1 to 20 to allow the onboard mics to filter in ambient sounds around you. A \u201cvoice passthrough\u201d toggle works to amplify outside voices while \u201csuppressing noise\u201d to make them more audible. The catch is it\u2019s only as effective as the amount of ambience you let in. If you\u2019re struggling to hear what someone\u2019s saying, you either have to crank it to 20 or just pause playback altogether.\nThe mode acts much like ambient modes do on any other pair of earbuds. What Sony doesn\u2019t mention is that playback volume is a factor in how well the mode can possibly work. If you\u2019re listening at a louder volume while walking outside and you go to talk to someone, the audio often drowns out the material effect of the voice passthrough. Where it\u2019s most valuable is in hearing what someone\u2019s saying after you\u2019ve already paused your tunes.\nDespite that, Sony tries to be generous with the rest of the feature set in the app. Pairing the earbuds is easy enough, as Google Fast Pair works for Android devices. Heck, it even threw in Swift Pair for quick pairing with Windows PCs. No such luck with Apple\u2019s devices (naturally), though these earbuds are definitely AirPods competitors once you use them with an iPhone or iPad.\nMultipoint allows them to stay paired with two devices at the same time. Switching between them feels pretty straightforward, like getting a phone call from your work phone while listening to music from your personal one, as an example. I didn\u2019t run into any issues.\nThe Sound Connect app gives you the same five-band equalizer you get to use with Sony\u2019s more expensive earbuds, and I suggest doing so. You may like how the WF-C510 sound out of the box, but I would recommend tinkering with the EQ to breathe some life into them. You have the option to also go through the app\u2019s \u201cFind Your Equalizer\u201d test to personalize output, except I did better by tweaking things myself. These are budget earbuds, after all, but they don\u2019t always sound like that, which is a testament to Sony\u2019s ability to deliver improved sonic performance in a smaller design.\nCrowd-pleasing audio\nYou\u2019ll likely need to give the bass a boost off the bat, but the mids aren\u2019t muddy and the highs don\u2019t feel flat, either. We\u2019re talking about crowd-pleasing audio here, and I can see the results satisfying most everyone, apart from bass lovers who want a deeper sound. While the AirPods 4 now have ANC variants, the WF-C510 simply sound better in a passive-versus-passive situation, even if you\u2019re better off tweaking Sony\u2019s buds first.\nSony includes its DSEE proprietary technology to enhance the quality of compressed codecs like MP3 and AAC \u2014 which is as good as it gets when there are no hi-res codecs on board. It works on its own once you toggle it on in the app, impacting the mids more than any other part of the spectrum. Regardless of whether you understand what it\u2019s doing or not, you can hear the \u201cboost\u201d it provides to whatever music you\u2019re listening to.\nSony offers 360 Reality Audio for a semblance of spatial audio (without head tracking), only you can\u2019t really do much with it. You have to go through Peertracks, Artist Connection, nugs.net, or 360 Reality Live to set it up.\nThe only other integration I can speak to is Spotify Tap, should you choose to enable it. If you\u2019re a Premium subscriber, you can set it up through Sonic Connect so that double-pressing the left or right earbud\u2019s button starts a recommended Spotify playlist. I\u2019m not particularly fond of the feature myself, but can confirm that it works fine with the WF-C510.\nButton control grouping can be limiting\nSpeaking of buttons, the physical ones here are reliable no matter which function package you pick. You\u2019ll need them since there are no wear sensors to automatically play/pause music when removing either earbud. Moreover, for some baffling reason, Sony forces you to choose among a slate of controls rather than pick and choose what you\u2019d like to have. For example, under the Ambient Sound group, a single press on either earbud turns Ambient Sound on or off, whereas it plays/pauses under the Playback Control group.\nIf you\u2019re sticking to the latter, a double-press skips a track, a triple-press repeats one, and a long press activates your phone\u2019s voice assistant. Repeatedly tap on the right to raise volume and on the left to lower it. A potential downside with the controls is inadvertently skipping or repeating a track if you\u2019re not precise in pressing either side four times. Another problem is that Sony\u2019s rigid control-grouping approach imposes difficult choices you shouldn\u2019t have to make. If you like Spotify Tap and Ambient Sound, you shouldn\u2019t have to shuffle through control schemes to simply make them accessible directly from the earbuds.\nPhone calls operate at what I would typically expect from earbuds in this range. The good passive isolation made it easier for me to hear callers, but I could do little to offset what they might hear around me unless I moved to a quieter space. These aren\u2019t ideal for longer conversations while venturing outside.\nWith battery life, there are other caveats to consider. Sony says the WF-C510 can go up to 11 hours, except that\u2019s only if you turn off Ambient Sound, DSEE, and Find Your Equalizer. Any combination of those knocks the number down closer to six or seven hours basedon how loud you go. That\u2019s still very acceptable for cheaper earbuds, and while the case only provides one additional charge, you know where you stand on battery through the app. There is no \u201cFind My\u201d functionality here, like you see with other earbuds, including the AirPods, so if you lose these, you have no way to track them.\nApple users might look at the Beats Solo Buds as a better alternative, much like Android users could look at the Samsung Galaxy Buds FE as an option. Having listened to all three, Sony makes a good bang-for-the-buck case, with the WF-C510 by undercutting both on price. The tougher competition comes from the budget earbuds that include ANC, like the Earfun Air Pro 4 and Soundcore Space A40, both of which cost more, but expand features and customization further.\nStill, for $60, these earbuds are hard to pass up for any bargain hunter. You should pass if you want rumbling bass, but if your expectations are more modest, you\u2019re likely to come away liking what you hear for both your ears and your wallet."

      "text": "Sony WF-1000XM6 (YY2985) Import Filing (Update)\nBack in May. the internal code for the WF-1000XM6 was revealed by none other than Sony in their Sound Connect app. Since that post, not only has Sony removed any mention of the WF-1000XM6 in the app, they also removed all of the YY codes.\nApart from the information from Sony's app, we had no direct evidence of the WF-1000XM6, until today. An import filing has appeared which shows the WF-1000XM6 (YY2985).\nUpdate - July 7\nI had another import filing from mid March but it did not provide enough context. But now with a second import filing from early May, it makes more sense. We do not have all of the data in the first photo, but the second photo from another import site does. This filing only recently went up online.\n| Sony WF-1000XM6 retail box dimensions |\nNext up, we have this early May import, also using the HDX-2985 code.\nThe WF-1000XM5 itself has the same parts, the top and bottom boxes, the inner frame to hold the charging case, and underneath, the accessory tray. We are missing the instruction manual tray present in the WF-1000XM5, so perhaps Sony has removed this from the new model. We can use the dimensions from the import filing to compare it to the WF-1000XM5. Unfortunately I do not own a pair of calipers, so the WF-1000XM5 measurements are from my own headset using a ruler, so not 100% accurate.\n| WF-1000XM6 | WF-1000XM5 | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Box (top) | 84 x 70 x 27.5 mm | 99 x 66.5 x 26.5 mm |\n| Box (bottom) | 84 x 70 x 27.5 mm | 99 x 66.5 x 26.5 mm |\n| Inner Frame | 81.7 x 67.7 x 26.2 mm | 96 x 60.5 x 25 mm |\n| Acc. tray | 80.8 x 66.8 x 13.1 mm | 95 x 60 x 13 mm |\nThe actual boxes will have rounded corners, which is not possible in the online comparison tool. But what good are case dimensions? Well for one, they reveal that Sony has not decided to go for a different design, ie square case like the LinkBuds Fit. And second, the size of the charging case and earbuds should be similar to the current model. It is definitely possible to make the box smaller. but maintain the similar size of charging case.\nWe know Sony reduced the battery capacity 12.5% on the WH-1000XM6 compared to the WH-1000XM5, so it is possible we will see a similar decrease on the WF-1000XM6. Personally, I would rather Sony keep the same batteries, considering newer more efficient components would help increase the battery life.\nBtw, if anyone wishes to 3D model some more accurate comparisons, here are the full dimensions for both models.\n- WF-1000XM5 - 99mm x 66.4mm x 53mm\n- WF-1000XM6 - 84mm x 70mm x 55mm\nEnd of update.\nIf you wish to support my work here on the blog, you can do so through Buy me a coffee, Click the banner for more details. Thank you.\nNice to see new rumblings. If you had to make a prediction on price at this stage, what are you thinking?\nReplyDelete410$\nDeleteSony raised the price of the wh-1000xm6, so I would expect higher price on the new wf xm6\nDeleteWF, WH, and WI - Interesting! What is Sony's naming scheme really? Wireless Frameless, Headphones, and Interconnected - or what? Anyone knows?\nReplyDeleteDidn't we always know that the earbuds were coming? The real question has always been when.\nReplyDeleteIs it pretty much certain it won't be here by August since there is still no FCC filings or does this count?\nReplyDeletethis teasing is crazy, come on Sony where's the cert\nReplyDeleteThere's a review at Kollox dot Com. Is it fake, just trying to get traffic to their site, or has someone maybe tested them? SOMEBODIES gotta test the things before release. Maybe someone with better knowledge and access can check?\nReplyDeleteYes just traffic to their site. It is fake. They also have a fake review for iPhone 17 air.\nDelete"

      "text": "- Great sound quality\n- Good battery life\n- Excellent noise cancellation\n- Wireless charging\n- May not fit small ears\n- Slightly lacking in high-end detail\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nSony\u2019s eagerly anticipated follow-up to its very highly rated WF-1000XM3 noise-canceling true wireless earbuds is finally here. The WF-1000XM4 cost $280, and they address even our very few critiques of the XM3 with a laundry list of improvements \u2014 some big, some small.\nHas Sony once again established a new benchmark for the true wireless world, or does it still have some work to do? Let\u2019s get into it.\nEditor\u2019s note: Sony updated the WF-1000XM4 in March 2023 with new firmware that enables Bluetooth Multipoint. It hasn\u2019t changed our score, but we\u2019ve updated this review to reflect the enhancement.\nVideo Review\nWhat\u2019s in the box\nFirst of all, big props to Sony for creating packaging that should be adopted as an industry standard. The XM4 come in a tiny box that eschews all the flashy labeling and glossy prints you\u2019ll see on boxes from companies like JBL and Soundcore. As a result, every piece can be recycled or composted.\nThe only hint of plastic is in the thin exterior wrapping band that holds the two halves of the box together. Once opened, there\u2019s no way to close it again, but I\u2019m willing to bet most people discard their earbuds packages anyway, which is really the whole point.\nInside you\u2019ll find the WF-1000XM4 already tucked into their charging case, a short USB-C charging cable, two extra sizes of foam eartips (the mediums are pre-installed), and some printed instructions.\nDesign\nAs much as we heap praise on the WF-1000XM3, they\u2019ve always had one big caveat: They are among the bulkiest buds you can buy that aren\u2019t specifically designed for aggressive workouts. That goes for the earbuds and their copper-topped charging case.\nThe WF-1000XM4 earbuds are 10% smaller than the XM3, which is good but not earth-shattering. The charging case, on the other hand, is 40% smaller, and it now has wireless charging as an option. That\u2019s a big deal. The case still isn\u2019t AirPods Pro small, but it\u2019s no longer the odd man out when looking at the rest of the true wireless options. I\u2019m now comfortable calling it a pocketable case \u2014 which I couldn\u2019t say of the XM3.\nThe touch-sensitive control surfaces are now way easier to accurately tap.\nThe case lid opens easily and stays open on its own until you close it, which it does with a satisfying snap. But getting the earbuds takes a surprising amount of effort compared with the XM3 due to incredibly strong magnets and the tight shape of the charging socket. On the plus side, those magnets also grab the earbuds the moment they come close to the sockets, instantly and securely reseating them.\nThe other big change is the shape of the earbuds themselves. For years, Sony used the same capsule shape for its true wireless earbuds, with the bulk of the body protruding significantly from your ear. For the XM4, Sony\u2019s designers tried something completely different, creating a more compact, rounded housing that sits much closer. It looks much better in my opinion, though there may be some disagreement over the look of the prominent copper-capped microphone enclosures. And it\u2019s not just for looks: The touch-sensitive control surface now occupies almost 100% of the exposed portion of the earbud, making it significantly easier to accurately tap. With the XM3, you had to make sure your fingers connected with a small touch-sensitive circle.\nI\u2019m not generally a fan of touch controls, but the XM4 could make me a convert.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Sony has addressed one of our other small gripes with the XM3: The lack of waterproofing. With an IPX4 rating, the XM4 are officially sweatproof for the gym or wherever else you need to take them.\nComfort, controls, and connections\nI find the WF-1000XM4 quite comfortable to wear, but I\u2019m not convinced everyone will agree. The new shape is designed to fit within your concha \u2014 the cavity that leads to the ear canal. But the XM4 are quite large. If you happen to have small ears, you might not be able to insert them all the way. The XM3, by comparison, have a much smaller in-concha \u201cfootprint,\u201d to use an awkward metaphor.\nThe XM4 feel bigger in my ears than most of the top contenders, including the Jabra Elite 85t, Apple AirPods Pro, Master & Dynamic MW08, and JBL Tour Pro+.\nThe foam eartips conform to your ear shape better than silicone: You won\u2019t have to struggle to find a set that fits.\nIf your ears can accommodate the XM4\u2019s larger shape, you\u2019ll be rewarded with a very secure fit. There\u2019s a ton of surface contact, and once inserted, they won\u2019t be going anywhere. They inspire much more confidence than their predecessors.\nWhile the XM3 were available with silicone eartips, the XM4 exclusively come with memory foam. They conform to your ear shape better than silicone, which means you probably won\u2019t have to struggle as much to find a set that fits. But they also create a stronger sense of having an object lodged in your ear canal, and they break down faster than silicone.\nI\u2019m not generally a fan of touch controls, but the XM4 could make me a convert. The generous size of the touch pads makes taps easy, accurate, and quick.\nI\u2019m less enthusiastic about Sony\u2019s control customization scheme, which it has kept from the XM3. The Headphones app groups controls by function: Ambient, playback, volume, and none. Because each earbud can be assigned to only one control group, you have to pick your favorite two. Want to control playback and volume? You won\u2019t be able to switch ANC modes. Like ANC control and also playback? Volume is no longer available. JBL does the same thing, so it\u2019s not like this situation is unique to Sony, but I\u2019d prefer more a-la-carte flexibility.\nThere is a workaround, at least for Android users. The XM4 enable wake-word access to both Google Assistant and Alexa when using a phone with Android 6 or higher. Either of these voice assistants can control volume for you, so if you pick playback and ambient for your physical controls, you could always say, \u201cAlexa, turn up the volume.\u201d\nWear sensors let you auto-pause and resume playback when you remove or reinsert the earbuds, and they work really well, rapidly responding to changes. If it bugs you, you can disable it in the Headphones app.\nThe frequency response is strong from end to end, and there\u2019s an incredible depth to the bass.\nThe excellent Bluetooth connection on the XM4 works very smoothly and allowed me to put 40 or 50 feet between the earbuds and my phone before the connection started to wobble. Unlike the XM3, which would occasionally give me tiny, half-second dropouts, the XM4 never missed a beat. Now that the XM4 have been updated with Bluetooth multipoint, which lets you connect the earbuds to two devices simultaneously, they\u2019re even more useful.\nSound quality\nThe WF-1000XM4 sound terrific. The frequency response is strong from end to end, and there\u2019s an incredible depth to the bass. I guarantee that anyone who pops them in will enjoy their rich and full sound signature.\nBut as I jumped back and forth between the XM4 and the XM3, something became apparent: The XM3 exhibit clearer upper midranges and high frequencies that give vocals just a bit more presence. It also adds a level of energy that the XM4 seem to lack.\nThese observations are based on factory settings, with no EQ adjustments within the Sony Headphones app. Switching the XM4 to \u201cBright\u201d or \u201cTreble Boost\u201d helps a little, but even then, I think the XM3 are better overall for clarity.\nWill you notice this if you just listen to the XM4? I doubt it. It\u2019s really only when you put the two side by side, listening to track after track, that it becomes apparent.\nThe XM4 are Sony\u2019s first true wireless earbuds to support the company\u2019s high-quality LDAC Bluetooth codec. In theory, at least, this should let them reproduce far more nuance than the XM3, which only work with the much lower-bandwidth SBC and AAC codecs. Moreover, the XM4 have DSEE Extreme, Sony\u2019s latest version of its excellent digital signal processing technology, which can upscale lossy digital music like MP3s to a far higher quality.\nTo be clear, the difference between these two siblings is really a matter of taste. The XM4 do a better job of low-end detail, which you can really hear when songs layer bass guitar, drums, and low-end synthesizers on top of each other. All too often, those elements get smeared together, but the XM4 let you hear them distinctly, which is a real joy. So consider the XM4 an alternative interpretation of Sony\u2019s excellent sound quality, but one that is geared toward those who want to hear extra detail in the low end.\nNoise cancellation and transparency\nSony\u2019s noise cancellation tech has always been excellent, and the WF-1000XM4 manage to improve on it. Sony claims the Integrated Processor V1 chip inside the XM4 improves on the XM3\u2019s ANC performance across the board, diminishing external sounds throughout the audible spectrum. I\u2019m inclined to agree.\nThe XM4 aren\u2019t just better at masking sound; they\u2019re better at doing it invisibly.\nOne of my benchmark tests for ANC is to run my loud bathroom vent fan, which produces both low and high-frequency sounds. I then turn ANC on and off to listen to the differences and repeat the process at different distances. The XM4 ace this test, killing off close to 90% of the fan\u2019s noise at a distance of 3 feet and 100% when I sit just outside the bathroom.\nBut the XM4 aren\u2019t just better at masking sound; they\u2019re better at doing it invisibly. Some ANC systems kill external sounds but introduce new ones, like a low-grade hiss that is audible when there\u2019s no music playing. The XM4\u2019s ANC system is very quiet, which is what you want when you need to concentrate in a noisy environment and don\u2019t want to drown out those sounds with music.\nApple\u2019s AirPods Pro established a firm lead over the WF-1000XM3 in this arena, but the XM4 have once again leveled the playing field. But the XM4, even with Sony\u2019s optional wind-noise reduction system, are still not as effective at canceling wind sound as the AirPods Pro.\nTransparency mode is also more convenient to use thanks to the new speak-to-chat feature. It uses sensors to figure out when you\u2019re speaking and automatically engages transparency mode while pausing your music. I found it worked really well. The Headphones app lets you toggle it on and off, adjust its sensitivity, and decide how long transparency should remain turned on after it detects your voice.\nBattery life\nWhen fully charged, Sony claims eight hours of play time with ANC turned on and an impressive 12 hours when it\u2019s turned off \u2014 a big boost over the XM3\u2019s capacity of six and eight hours, respectively. Several features, like wake-word access to voice assistants and wind-noise reduction, will reduce these numbers, but on the whole, I found they were accurate.\nThe XM4 also get a faster quick-charge option: A five-minute quick charge adds another hour of playback time, while the XM3 took 10 minutes to gain 90 minutes of playback. The charging case contains enough juice for two full charges, which gives a total listening time of at least 24 hours before you need to go in search of an outlet or wireless charging mat.\nVoice assistant compatibility\nSony has always taken an agnostic approach to voice assistants on its headphones: You can choose to use your phone\u2019s built-in assistant, or you can switch to Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.\nAndroid users even get something that has been a rarity on wireless earbuds: The ability to trigger Alexa or Google Assistant by simply speaking their wake words. I tried it with both assistants, and it works as well as the Google Pixel Buds Pro or the Amazon Echo Buds, with each assistant responding quickly and accurately to my voice commands.\nCall quality\nCalling on the WF-1000XM4 is good. Most competing sounds, like traffic, are effectively neutralized, and so is wind noise, which was a weakness of the WF-1000XM3. It\u2019s not perfect: As the earbuds attempt to correct for these external noises \u2014 especially wind \u2014 it can sound like you\u2019re speaking through several layers of fabric. But since that\u2019s preferable to listening to the annoying whistle of the wind, I think it\u2019s an improvement.\nWhen on a call, the earbuds automatically disengage ANC, but you can still decide to turn it back on or switch to transparency mode, something that not all earbuds let you do mid-call.\nOur take\nSony has taken the already superb WF-1000XM3 and made meaningful improvements across the board with its new WF-1000XM4. Though the new shape may create fit problems for some, they\u2019re among the best true wireless earbuds you can buy.\nIs there a better alternative?\nFeature for feature, it\u2019s hard to find a set of wireless earbuds that can truly compete with the WF-1000XM4, but there are better options for specific functions.\nThe AirPods Pro and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are better for ANC and transparency, with the Bose shining especially brightly for call quality.\nThe Master & Dynamic MW08 deliver a more nuanced sound quality, with better clarity.\nAnd now that Sony is still selling the WF-1000XM3 for a reduced price of $180, they\u2019re still very much worth your consideration if you\u2019re ok with some missing features like wireless charging and water resistance.\nHow long will they last?\nSony backs the WF-1000XM4 with a one-year warranty, but I expect they\u2019ll last for many years. The build quality and materials are both excellent. The foam eartips will probably need to be replaced every six months with consistent daily wear, but that\u2019s not unusual.\nShould you buy them?\nAbsolutely. If you\u2019re looking for wireless earbuds packed with awesome features, excellent ANC, and fantastic sound quality, you can\u2019t go wrong with the WF-1000XM4."
