APPN\n1 https://register-conf.media-server.com/register/BI1e1e5237257b42d09d37bb52ee5552aa\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, Appian provides investors with certain non-GAAP financial performance measures. Appian uses these non-GAAP financial performance measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Appian's management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Appian's performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. Appian believes both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Appian's performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to historical performance as well as comparisons to competitors' operating results. Appian believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by Appian's institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of Appian's business.\nThe non-GAAP financial performance measures include the following: non-GAAP subscriptions cost of revenue, non-GAAP professional services cost of revenue, non-GAAP total cost of revenue, non-GAAP total operating expense, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP income tax expense (benefit), non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted. These non-GAAP financial performance measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, unrealized foreign exchange rate gains and losses, certain non-ordinary litigation-related expenses consisting of legal and other professional fees associated with the Pegasystems cases (net of insurance reimbursements), or Litigation Expense, amortization of the judgment preservation insurance policy, or JPI Amortization, severance costs related to an involuntary reduction in our workforce, or Severance Costs, and lease impairment and lease-related charges associated with actions taken to reduce the footprint of our leased office spaces, or Lease Impairment and Lease-Related Charges. While some of these items may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods as these items can vary significantly from period to period depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may occur. Therefore, while we may incur or recognize these types of expenses in the future, we believe removing these items for purposes of calculating our non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a more focused presentation of our ongoing operating performance.\nAppian also discusses adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance measure it believes offers a useful view of the overall operation of its businesses. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (1) other (income) expense, net, (2) interest expense, (3) income tax expense (benefit), (4) depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets, (5) stock-based compensation expense, (6) Litigation Expense, (7) JPI Amortization, (8) Severance Costs, and (9) Lease Impairment and Lease-Related Charges. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA is net loss. Users should consider the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net loss as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and Appian's non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, see the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures at the end of this press release.\nAppian provides guidance ranges for non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA; however, we are not able to reconcile these amounts to their comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a GAAP basis is unavailable, subject to high variability, dependent on future events outside of our control, and cannot be predicted. In addition, Appian believes such reconciliations could imply a degree of precision that might be confusing or misleading to investors. The actual effect of the reconciling items that Appian may exclude from these non-GAAP expense numbers, when determined, may be significant to the calculation of the comparable GAAP measures.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements contained in this press release other than statements of historical facts, including statements regarding Appian's future financial and business performance for the third quarter and full year 2025, future investment by Appian in its go-to-market initiatives, increased demand for the Appian Platform, market opportunity and plans and objectives for future operations, including Appian's ability to drive continued subscriptions revenue and total revenue growth, are forward-looking statements. The words \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"plan,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Appian has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that Appian believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties associated with Appian's ability to grow its business and manage its growth, Appian's ability to sustain its revenue growth rate, continued market acceptance of Appian's Platform and adoption of low-code solutions to drive digital transformation, the fluctuation of Appian's operating results due to the length and variability of its sales cycle, competition in the markets in which Appian operates, AI being a disruptive set of technologies that may affect the markets for Appian's software dramatically and in unpredictable ways, risks and uncertainties associated with the composition and concentration of Appian's customer base and their demand for its platform and satisfaction with the services provided by Appian, Appian's ability to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Appian's strategic relationships with third parties, and additional risks and uncertainties set forth in the \"Risk Factors\" section of Appian's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, Appian operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for Appian's management to predict all risks, nor can Appian assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements Appian may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, Appian cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. Appian is under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this press release to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law.\nInvestor Contact\nJack Andrews\nVice President, Investor Relations\ninvestors@appian.com\nMedia Contact\nValerie Miller\nSenior Manager, Media Relations North America\npr@appian.com\n| APPIAN

      "text": "Supercharge Your Trading With Benzinga Tools\nRecent Earning News\nEarnings rank as one of the most important fundamental elements that determine a company\u2019s stock price. The earnings of a company refers to its after-tax net income, which can give you a good indication of the company\u2019s future profitability.\nA company\u2019s earnings numbers depict its profitability over a certain period of time, typically a year or a quarterly 3-month period. Most analysts use quarterly earnings as a benchmark to assess a company\u2019s performance.\nThe deviation of earnings from the analyst consensus, also known as the \u201cearnings call\u201d or \u201cconference call\u201d, can have a notable impact on a company\u2019s stock price. The release of better-than-expected earnings numbers should prompt a rally in a stock\u2019s price but the price can sometimes decline as market participants take profits. Remember, too, that an earnings report is paired with other figures and news items to help investors make wise decisions.\nWhat is an Earnings Calendar?\nAn earnings calendar shows the date and time of upcoming financial results of public companies. Analysts, traders and investors keep track of earnings releases by using an earnings calendar. Earnings calendars help traders and investors track the financial performance of the companies and make investment decisions.\nEvery earnings announcement will have different implications for the stock market, and taking note of all the earnings dates for your assets helps you remain abreast of changes in your portfolio. For example, if you have invested in Tesla and the firm plans to increase vehicle production, you need to know. If the share price is lagging and the firm plans a buyback, you need to know that.\nIf an asset in which you invest is correlated with the price of crude oil, you need to hear what the executive team thinks about the oil market.\nThe earnings calendar typically also gives market consensus estimates. Analysts, traders and investors can use this data to make or compare their own projections. It also helps market participants plan their strategies for the earnings release date in advance.\nHow Are Earnings Calculated?\nNet earnings refer to the earnings of a company relevant to its stock price. Net earnings consist of the amount of income earned after mandatory deductions and withholding like federal income tax and money withheld from employees through the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA).\nNet earnings equal the sales or revenue of the company minus the cost of sales, expenses, deductions and taxes and get computed over a specific period of time, such as a quarter or year.\nAn example: Consider a company with gross sales of $1,000,000 over a 1-year period. Subtract from that number the cost of goods sold: $600,000, the company\u2019s operating expenses: $160,000, and its tax payments: $40,000 \u2014 a total of $800,000 for that same period.\nThis leaves the company with a net income, profit or earnings amount of $200,000 for the year.\nEarnings reflect the overall financial performance of the company and factor into computing the key earnings per share (EPS) metric that provides an indicator of a company\u2019s profitability. Earnings per share means the company\u2019s profit/loss attributes to each shareholder of the company.\n- General accepted account principles (GAAP) EPS: Calculated by dividing the net income by the number of shares outstanding.\n- Adjusted EPS: Calculated by excluding nonrecurring items from net income and dividing by the number of shares outstanding.\nTwo other types of earnings that are generally reported on a company\u2019s financial statement:\n- Accumulated earnings: Net profits made by a corporation not disbursed to shareholders as dividends but retained and reinvested in the company instead.\n- Retained earnings: Listed as ownership or equity in the company. Retained earnings consist of the total net income of the company over the company\u2019s life that has not been distributed to shareholders. Shareholders can get these funds via a dividend.\nWhy Are Earnings Important?\nEarnings are one of the most important metrics for the valuation of a company\u2019s stock. They can strongly impact a publicly traded company\u2019s stock price because investors base their investment decisions on the company\u2019s recent earnings and their expectations for its future earnings.\nEarnings are often a key factor in investment decisions like whether to hold, buy or sell shares in the company. They also help investors estimate the short and long term performance of the company and identify whether a company is suitable for the portfolio based on investment objectives.\nNew companies and those that report negative earnings may appear at first glance to be high-risk investments. Keep in mind, however, that some highly successful companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) started out with years of negative earnings before turning profitable.\nCompanies that have recently gone public (and have a new and engaging product or service) also typically go through a period of negative earnings before they become profitable. Insightful investors often buy up these promising stocks despite the fact that the associated companies show negative earnings. If a company eventually begins to make money, the associated rise in share price will generally justify their initial investment with increased capital gains on their stock.\nOther important metrics:\n- Earnings per share (EPS): A metric that provides a key indicator of a company\u2019s profitability. Earnings per share means the company\u2019s profit/loss attributable to each shareholder of the company.\n- Total revenue: Total revenue reveals the amount of money the company takes in from its sales of either goods or services. Depending on the company\u2019s expenses and other outlays, a rise in total revenue can lead to increased earnings.\n- EBIT: Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is one of the most important metrics stock analysts consider because it takes into account the company\u2019s net income before deducted interest and taxes. Many analysts consider the EBIT growth as more important than total revenue growth since it provides a broader picture of the company\u2019s profitability.\n- Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio or PER): This important metric gives you an idea of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued in relation to its earnings. A high P/E ratio could mean that a company\u2019s stock is currently overvalued or that expectations of higher earnings are already included in the stock\u2019s current price. A low PER could indicate either that the stock is undervalued or that the company\u2019s business model cannot sustain higher earnings, so its share price has fallen although earnings have not been affected yet.\nDepending on the type of stock, the PER could be extremely high but is considered justified by the market due to the company\u2019s future prospects and/or high rate of growth. For example, tech and biotech stocks typically carry a high PER due to investor expectations of substantial future profitability.\nIs it Better to Buy Stocks Before or After Earnings?\nDeciding whether to buy stock before or after an earnings release depends on your investment objectives. For example, if you are a short term trader and want to make a quick profit, then you might buy before the earnings release to speculate on significant stock movement occurring on earnings day.\nOn the other hand, if you are a long-term investor, then you might wait for the earnings to include the latest earnings into your investment model so that you can better estimate the company\u2019s long-term performance.\nMany stocks go through a period of low activity ahead of announcing earnings. This makes sense since institutional investors typically prefer to wait for a positive earnings release before committing more capital.\nAs a rule of thumb, many investors avoid buying shares ahead of an earnings release because of the uncertainty and extra risk involved. An exception could involve using an option strategy to establish a limited risk position in a stock that could also benefit from increased market volatility.\nCompanies generally release earnings before or after the market closes. If released before the opening, the earnings result typically increases the volatility of the stock during the day of its release. If earnings are released after the market closes, the stock price may show increased volatility in the after market, but this usually normalizes by the time the market opens the next day.\nWhen a Company Beats Expected Earnings\nAccording to general market theory, a favorable earnings release that beats the analyst consensus should have a positive impact on the company\u2019s stock price, while an unfavorable release should have a negative impact.\nFor example, if a company announces better quarterly earnings than the analyst consensus expected, then the company\u2019s stock price generally increases. Conversely, if the company announces earnings that fall short of analyst expectations, then the company\u2019s stock comes under selling pressure.\nWhile this makes perfect sense to most people, this generality does not always occur for a number of reasons. Sometimes the price can go down even though a company beats the expected earnings.\n- For example, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) might beat analysts\u2019 EPS estimation but miss their number of iPhone sales estimation. In another instance, Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) might beat the market\u2019s consensus EPS estimation but miss its subscriber growth expectation. In both cases, the stock price might decline despite an unexpected rise in earnings.\n- Another reason for a diverging stock price from a positive or negative earnings release are the rumors spread among savvy market participants ahead of the release. Such rumors can prompt traders and investors to take positions in advance of the official earnings announcement.\n- For example, a company\u2019s stock might rally significantly before a better than expected earnings release but subsequently sells off after the release. You can attribute this to the market having responded to the favorable news spread as a rumor by already discounting it by the time the earnings actually become known to the general public. This is the reasoning behind the old Wall Street adage of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the fact.\u201d\nFurthermore, the hype generated by public expectations leading up to the day of the better than expected earnings release can also spark technical buying in the stock ahead of the release. Once the earnings have been made public, shareholders take profits by selling the stock they had previously purchased ahead of the earnings release date, thereby causing the stock price to perhaps surprisingly decline on the good news.\nThis common scenario can also arise when a company releases lower than expected earnings. In the case of a lower-than-expected earnings call, the stock can subsequently rally as short sellers take profits and investors interpret the negative news as a buying opportunity.\nHow to Make Money Trading the Earnings Calendar\nThe earnings calendar shows when each company is due to release their quarterly earnings press releases. The stock price ideally goes up when a company beats earnings estimates and goes down when it misses estimates, although exceptions do exist.\n- As the earnings date approaches, traders and investors can focus on how closely the analyst consensus for the reported earnings matches the actual number by looking at the earnings beat or miss on the earnings day.\n- Many stock operators also examine a company\u2019s history of earnings releases. If the company has consistently beaten analyst estimates over several quarters and the stock has rallied on each of the earnings releases and a positive release is expected, then the trader or investor can feel confident in a decision to buy the stock before the earnings release.\n- Other ways to profit from an earnings release with limited risk is to purchase options. A straddle or strangle involving the purchase of both a put and a call could be profitable if the volatility increases as the earnings date approaches.\nThe upside of this type of bidirectional option strategy is that the buyer of the straddle stands to make money regardless of the direction the stock may take after the earnings are released, as long as the move is significant and implied volatility does not collapse before they can trade out of the position.\nWhen is Earnings Season?\nEarnings season means the time when many large publicly traded companies report their financial results. Federal securities laws require companies to disclose information and file financial statements within 45 days of the end of a financial quarter or year.\nThe time period that corresponds to earnings season therefore comes around every quarter. It typically begins 1 or 2 weeks after the end of the last month of each quarter in March, June, September and December."

Register Now \u2192\nRivian Automotive RIVN shares declined on Wednesday after the electric vehicle manufacturer posted mixed second-quarter results and issued a downbeat outlook, prompting a round of price target cuts from Wall Street analysts.\nThe company reported second-quarter revenue of $1.303 billion, a 5.1% year-over-year increase that slightly surpassed the Street consensus estimate of $1.29 billion, according to Benzinga Pro.\nHowever, the adjusted loss of 97 cents per share came in wider than the expected 76 cents per share loss, underscoring continued profitability challenges.\nAlso Read: Rivian Gains On Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi Hype, But Challenges Loom\nIn response to the earnings, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained Rivian with an Outperform rating and lowered the price forecast from $18 to $16.\nWhile revenues modestly exceeded expectations, driven by higher average selling prices and growth in the software and services segment, profitability deteriorated.\nSoftware and services revenue rose to $376 million, up from $318 million in the prior quarter, with approximately $182 million stemming from Rivian\u2019s joint venture with Volkswagen VWAGY.\nHowever, adjusted gross margin fell steeply to 4.9%, down from 26.5% in the previous quarter, primarily due to lower production volumes and roughly $137 million in fixed cost impacts. Tariffs had only a minor impact during the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA came in at a loss of $667 million, significantly wider than the Street\u2019s anticipated $492.7 million loss, as the company ramped up investment in its R2 product line and service infrastructure.\nRivian reaffirmed its full-year delivery guidance of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles but downgraded its profitability outlook. The company now expects gross profit to be roughly breakeven, down from a prior forecast of $300 million.\nThis change is primarily due to recent regulatory changes that have created a net negative impact of a couple thousand dollars per unit.\nA major part of this loss comes from the elimination of a high-margin revenue stream: $160.0 million in regulatory credits that the company was previously expecting to earn. Adjusted EBITDA guidance was revised to a range of negative $2.25 billion to $2.0 billion, well below the consensus estimate of negative $1.88 billion.\nDespite short-term challenges, Ives maintained an Outperform rating, while lowering the price forecast, citing regulatory uncertainty, tariffs, and macro headwinds as near-term hurdles in Rivian\u2019s broader transformation.\nJP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman took a more pessimistic view, reaffirming an Underweight rating and cutting his price forecast from $10 to $9. Brinkman lowered his estimates and price forecast on Rivian following a wider-than-expected second-quarter EBITDA loss and a deeper full-year guide-down.\nWhile revenue of $1.303 billion beat JPMorgan\u2019s $1.211 billion estimate and the Street\u2019s $1.283 billion, nearly all other metrics disappointed. Regulatory credit revenue came in at just $3 million, well below Brinkman\u2019s $107 million forecast, due to legislative changes that reduced demand for EPA and CAFE credits.\nCore automotive gross margin excluding credits fell sharply to -36%, compared to JPMorgan\u2019s -11% estimate, leading to a combined gross profit loss of $335 million versus the firm\u2019s projected $90 million loss.\nSoftware and services showed relative strength, posting a gross profit of $129 million versus the expected $75 million, while operating expenses were lower than anticipated at $908 million.\nDespite these positives, the second-quarter EBITDA loss of $667 million fell far short of JPMorgan\u2019s forecast of $535 million and consensus of $493 million.\nBrinkman sees Rivian\u2019s updated full-year outlook, now forecasting an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.125 billion at the midpoint (down from $1.8 billion prior) and regulatory credit revenue of $160 million (cut from $300 million), as indicative of both a more challenging regulatory environment and weaker internal execution.\nHe projects a $2.8 billion free cash outflow for 2025, up from $2.5 billion, equating to over 50% of estimated revenue and 20% of Rivian\u2019s market cap.\nWhile liquidity remains sufficient with $7.5 billion in cash and expected inflows from Volkswagen and DOE loans, Brinkman reaffirmed an Underweight rating and cut his price forecast.\nPrice Action: Rivian shares are trading lower by 3.16% at $11.79 at last check on Wednesday.\nRead Next:\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "- Rosenblatt\u2019s Abernethy raises Pegasystems price target to $61 after Q2 beat, driven by 24% cloud revenue growth\n- Analyst sees strong ACV momentum, 27% FCF margin, and reduced legal risk as tailwinds for long-term Pega growth\n- The market\u2019s back, and these 3 income stocks are thriving. See them here\u2192\nPegasystems Inc. PEGA exceeded expectations in its fiscal second-quarter 2025 results, demonstrating strong momentum driven by its cloud strategy.\nThe enterprise software company reported robust increases in both overall revenue and a significant surge in cloud revenue, along with key growth metrics like Annual Contract Value (ACV).\nThis solid performance reinforced confidence in Pegasystems\u2019 ongoing shift to cloud-based solutions and its embrace of AI-powered automation.\nAlso Read: Pegasystems Analysts Boost Their Forecasts After Upbeat Q2 Earnings\nFollowing these impressive results, Wall Street is taking note of Pegasystems\u2019 trajectory. Among the analysts providing updated commentary, Rosenblatt analyst Blair Abernethy maintained Pegasystems with a Buy and raised the price forecast from $59 to $61 on Wednesday.\nAbernethy maintained a bullish outlook on Pegasystems following its strong fiscal second-quarter 2025 results, which beat estimates and reinforced confidence in its cloud-driven growth strategy.\nPegasystems reported total revenue of $384.5 million, rising 9% year-over-year and exceeding the analyst\u2019s estimate of $367.1 million and the consensus of $361.8 million.\nThe upside was primarily fueled by a 24% year-over-year increase in cloud revenue, which reached $166.7 million and accounts for 43% of total revenue.\nAbernethy emphasized that Annual Contract Value (ACV), a key growth metric, rose 16% year-over-year (14% in constant currency) to $1.514 billion, surpassing the estimated $1.476 billion.\nPega Cloud ACV jumped 28% year-over-year, reaching $761.1 million, indicating a continued shift from on-premise to cloud-based deployments. The analyst attributed these gains to strong customer renewals and growing traction for Pega Blueprint, which helps enterprises modernize and expand workflows using AI-powered automation.\nAbernethy noted that recurring maintenance revenue came in at $79.3 million, slightly ahead of the $76.5 million projection, while term license revenue, though down 6% year-over-year, beat estimates at $74.6 million. Operating margins reached 14.2%, supported by ongoing expense control and economies of scale in the cloud business. Free cash flow (FCF) hit $84.1 million, and operating cash flow reached $86.3 million in the quarter.\nThe company reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 guidance, including 12% ACV growth, $1.7 billion total revenue (up 7% year-over-year), $440 million free cash flow, and $455 million operating cash flow.\nAccording to the analyst, the court reversal of the previous $2 billion Appian APPN judgment has significantly reduced legal risk, and customer sentiment around the case appears to be improving.\nAbernethy expects Pega to generate $452.2 million in FCF in fiscal 2025, translating to a 27% FCF margin, with continued expansion into fiscal 2026-27 as the subscription model fully scales.\nFollowing second-quarter results, Abernethy slightly adjusted fiscal 2025\u201326 and estimates, introduced fiscal 2027 forecasts, based on a blended average of discounted cash flow (DCF) and EV/Sales valuation models.\nThe analyst concluded that Pega remains well-positioned for long-term growth, citing strong momentum in its cloud business, improving FCF profile, expanding automation opportunities, and reduced legal overhang.\nPrice Action: PEGA stock is trading lower by 0.90% to $57.45 at last check Thursday.\nRead Next:\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
