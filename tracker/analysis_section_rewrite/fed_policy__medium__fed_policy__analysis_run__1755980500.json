      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first pass but still feels like a high‑level summary rather than a world‑class scenario analysis. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking each macro driver to ACMR’s revenue mix (e.g., how a Fed rate cut lowers the discount rate for a 2025‑2028 revenue CAGR of ~25 % and boosts the price‑to‑earnings multiple from 18× to 22×). Replace vague statements (“potential Fed rate cuts”) with concrete timelines and triggers: cite the Treasury Secretary’s 150 bp call [C22MKA9VY] and the Fed’s 4.25‑4.5 % target range to set a September‑October cut window. Quantify the upside: current price $30.53 vs consensus $34.76 [SK994CBWR], 36 % Q1‑Q2 rally, and a projected $34.5 price by Q2‑2026 if the base case holds. Build a clear scenario matrix: (1) Base – Fed cuts + small‑cap rally → price $34.5; (2) Alt 1 – No rate cut but product ramp drives revenue to $950 m → price $33.0; (3) Alt 2 – Rate cut but export controls curtail China sales → price $31.5. Add specific catalysts (Q3 earnings beat, N2 tech adoption rate, Russell 2000 performance vs S&P 500) and invalidations (rate‑cut delay, persistent negative‑earning % in RUT, tightening export controls). Include watch‑list signals and a confidence rating (moderate‑high). Finally, embed citations inline using the source IDs (e.g., [SK994CBWR], [Q7VVGNSQE], [C22MKA9VY]) and avoid generic platitudes. This will elevate depth, clarity, and first‑principles rigor while meeting the 3–6‑month horizon and format constraints.",
