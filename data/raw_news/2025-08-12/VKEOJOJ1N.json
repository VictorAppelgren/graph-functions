  "content": "The Israeli military said Tuesday that it recently struck a group of militants in the Gaza Strip who were disguised as aid workers and using a car with the logo of World Central Kitchen, an international charity founded by celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s.\n\nThe army said it carried out an airstrike on the men after confirming with the charity that they were not affiliated with it and that the car did not belong to it.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen confirmed that the men and the vehicle were not affiliated with it. \u201cWe strongly condemn anyone posing as World Central Kitchen or other humanitarians, as this endangers civilians and aid workers,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nThe military shared video footage showing several men in yellow vests standing around a vehicle with the charity\u2019s logo on its roof. The military said five of the men were armed.\n\nThe relief group, founded in 2010, has worked from Haiti to Ukraine, dispatching teams that can quickly provide meals on a mass scale in conflict zones and after natural disasters. The group prides itself on providing food that fits with local tastes.\n\nIn April, an Israeli strike killed seven World Central Kitchen workers in Gaza. Israel quickly admitted it had mistakenly killed the aid workers and launched an investigation.\n\nIn November, an Israeli strike killed five people, including a World Central Kitchen worker who Israel said was part of the Hamas attack that sparked the war. WCK said at the time that it was unaware the employee had any connection to the attack.\n\nHamas-led militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals but 50 remain inside Gaza. Israel believes around 20 are still alive.\n\nIsrael\u2019s air and ground offensive has since displaced most of the population, destroyed vast areas and pushed the territory toward famine. It has killed more than 61,400 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.\n\nBesides those killed, 121 adults and 101 children have died of malnutrition-related causes, the ministry has said.\n\nThe ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",

      "text": "U.N. body says Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 aid-seekers in Gaza since May, as hunger worsens\n- Share via\nDEIR AL BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since May while trying to get food in the Gaza Strip, mostly near aid sites run by an American contractor, the U.N. human rights office said Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, Israeli strikes killed 25 people across Gaza, according to local health officials.\nDesperation is mounting in the Palestinian territory of more than 2 million, which experts say is at risk of famine because of Israel\u2019s blockade and nearly two-year offensive. A breakdown of law and order has led to widespread looting and contributed to chaos and violence around aid deliveries.\nIsrael accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid \u2014 without providing evidence of widespread diversion \u2014 and blames U.N. agencies for failing to deliver food it has allowed in. The military says it has only fired warning shots near aid sites. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed American contractor, rejected what it said were \u201cfalse and exaggerated statistics\u201d from the United Nations.\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, said Tuesday that 101 people, including 80 children, have died in recent days from starvation. During hunger crises, people often die from a combination of malnutrition, illness and deprivation.\nIsrael eased a two-and-a-half-month blockade in May, allowing a trickle of aid in through the longstanding U.N.-run system and the newly created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Aid groups say it\u2019s not nearly enough.\n\u2018I do it for my children\u2019\nDozens of Palestinians lined up Tuesday outside a charity kitchen in Gaza City, hoping for a bowl of watery tomato soup. The lucky ones got small chunks of eggplant. As supplies ran out, people holding pots pushed to get to the front.\nNadia Mdoukh, a pregnant woman who was displaced from her home and lives in a tent with her husband and three children, said she worries about being shoved or trampled on, and about heat stroke as daytime temperatures hover above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\u201cI do it for my children,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is famine \u2014 there is no bread or flour.\u201d\nThe U.N. World Food Program says Gaza\u2019s hunger crisis has reached \u201cnew and astonishing levels of desperation.\u201d Ross Smith, the agency\u2019s director for emergencies, told reporters Monday that nearly 100,000 women and children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition, and a third of Gaza\u2019s population is going without food for multiple days in a row.\nMedGlobal, a charity working in Gaza, said five children as young as 3 months had died from starvation in the past three days.\n\u201cThis is a deliberate and human-made disaster,\u201d said Joseph Belliveau, its executive director. \u201cThose children died because there is not enough food in Gaza and not enough medicines, including IV fluids and therapeutic formula, to revive them.\u201d\nThe charity said food is in such short supply that its own staff members suffer dizziness and headaches.\nAid delivery model criticized\nOf the 1,054 people killed while trying to get food since late May, 766 were killed while heading to sites run by the Israeli- and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, according to the U.N. human rights office. The others were killed when gunfire erupted around U.N. convoys or aid sites.\nThameen al-Kheetan, a spokesperson for the U.N. rights office, says its figures come from \u201cmultiple reliable sources on the ground,\u201d including medics, humanitarian and human rights organizations. He said the numbers were still being verified according to the office\u2019s strict methodology.\nPalestinian witnesses and health officials say Israeli forces regularly fire toward crowds of thousands of people heading to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation sites. The military says it has only fired warning shots, and the foundation says its armed contractors have only fired into the air on a few occasions to try to prevent stampedes.\nA joint statement from 28 Western-aligned countries on Monday condemned the \u201cthe drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians.\u201d\n\u201cThe Israeli government\u2019s aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity,\u201d read the statement, which was signed by the United Kingdom, France and other countries friendly to Israel. \u201cThe Israeli government\u2019s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable.\u201d\nIsrael and the United States rejected the statement, blaming Hamas for prolonging the war by not accepting Israeli terms for a ceasefire and the release of hostages abducted in the militant-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the fighting.\nHamas has said it will release the remaining hostages only in return for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Israel says it will keep fighting until Hamas has been defeated or disarmed.\nStrikes on tents sheltering the displaced\nIsraeli strikes killed at least 25 people Tuesday across Gaza, according to local health officials.\nOne strike hit tents sheltering displaced people in the built-up seaside Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, killing at least 12 people, according to Shifa Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said that it wasn\u2019t aware of such a strike by its forces.\nThe dead included three women and three children, the hospital director, Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiya, told the Associated Press. Thirty-eight other Palestinians were wounded, he said.\nAn overnight strike that hit crowds of Palestinians waiting for aid trucks in Gaza City killed eight, hospitals said. At least 118 were wounded, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\u201cA bag of flour covered in blood and death,\u201d said Mohammed Issam, who was in the crowd and said some people were run over by trucks in the chaos. \u201cHow long will this humiliation continue?\u201d\nThe Israeli military had no immediate comment on that strike. Israel blames the deaths of Palestinian civilians on Hamas, because the militants operate in densely populated areas.\nIsrael renewed its offensive in March with a surprise bombardment after ending an earlier ceasefire. Talks on another truce have dragged on for weeks.\nHamas-led militants abducted 251 people in the Oct. 7 attack, and killed around 1,200 people. Fewer than half of the 50 hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive.\nMore than 59,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. Its count doesn\u2019t distinguish between militants and civilians, but the ministry says that more than half of the dead are women and children. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties.\nShurafa, Magdy and Goldenberg write for the Associated Press. Magdy reported from Cairo and Goldenberg from Jerusalem. The AP\u2019s Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report."

      "text": "Dozens killed seeking aid in Gaza as Israel weighs further military action\n- Share via\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 At least 38 Palestinians were killed overnight and into Wednesday in the Gaza Strip while seeking aid from United Nations convoys and sites run by an Israeli-backed American contractor, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said it had fired warning shots when crowds approached its forces.\nAnother 25 people, including several women and children, were killed in Israeli airstrikes, according to local hospitals in Gaza. The military said it only targets Hamas militants.\nThe latest deaths came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected to announce further military action \u2014 and possibly plans for Israel to fully reoccupy Gaza. Experts say Israel\u2019s ongoing military offensive and blockade are already pushing the territory of some 2 million Palestinians into famine. A new U.N. report said only 1.5% of Gaza\u2019s cropland is accessible and undamaged.\nAnother escalation of the nearly 22-month war could put the lives of countless Palestinians and around 20 living Israeli hostages at risk, and would draw fierce opposition both internationally and within Israel. Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition allies have long called for the war to be expanded, and for Israel to eventually take over Gaza, relocate much of its population and rebuild Jewish settlements there.\nPresident Trump, asked by a reporter Tuesday whether he supported the reoccupation of Gaza, said he wasn\u2019t aware of the \u201csuggestion\u201d but that \u201cit\u2019s going to be pretty much up to Israel.\u201d\nMore Palestinians killed in scramble for food\nOf the 38 Palestinians killed while seeking aid, at least 28 died in the Morag Corridor, an Israeli military zone in southern Gaza where U.N. convoys have been repeatedly overwhelmed by looters and desperate crowds in recent days, and where witnesses say Israeli forces have repeatedly opened fire.\nThe Israeli military said troops fired warning shots as Palestinians advanced toward them, and that it was not aware of any casualties.\nNasser Hospital, which received the bodies, said another four people were killed in the Teina area, on a route leading to a site in southern Gaza run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an American contractor. The Al-Awda Hospital said it received the bodies of six people killed near a GHF site in central Gaza. GHF said there were no violent incidents at or near its sites.\nTwo of the Israeli airstrikes hit Gaza City, in the north of the territory, killing 13 people there, including six children and five women, according to the Al-Ahli Hospital, which received the bodies.\nThe Israeli military says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its militants are entrenched in heavily populated areas.\nU.N. experts say Israeli-backed aid group should be dismantled\nIsrael facilitated the establishment of four GHF sites in May after blocking the entry of all food, medicine and other goods for 2 1/2 months. Israeli and U.S. officials said a new system was needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off humanitarian aid.\nThe United Nations, which has delivered aid to hundreds of distribution points across Gaza throughout the war when conditions allow, has rejected the new system, saying it forces Palestinians to travel long distances and risk their lives for food, and that it allows Israel to control who gets aid, potentially using it to advance plans for further mass displacement.\nThe U.N. human rights office said last week that some 1,400 Palestinians have been killed seeking aid since May, mostly near GHF sites but also along U.N. convoy routes where trucks have been overwhelmed by crowds. It says nearly all were killed by Israeli fire.\nThis week, a group of U.N. special rapporteurs and independent human rights experts called for the GHF to be disbanded, saying it is \u201can utterly disturbing example of how humanitarian relief can be exploited for covert military and geopolitical agendas in serious breach of international law.\u201d\nThe experts work with the U.N. but do not represent the world body.\nThe GHF did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots when crowds threatened its forces, and GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray and fired into the air on some occasions to prevent deadly crowding at its sites.\nGaza\u2019s farmland has been destroyed, contributing to hunger crisis\nIsrael\u2019s air and ground war has destroyed nearly all of Gaza\u2019s food production capabilities, leaving its people reliant on international aid.\nA new report by the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization and the U.N. satellite center found that just 8.6% of Gaza\u2019s cropland is still accessible following sweeping Israeli evacuation orders in recent months. Just 1.5% is accessible and undamaged, it said.\nThe military offensive and a breakdown in security have made it nearly impossible for anyone to safely deliver aid, and aid groups say recent Israeli measures to facilitate more assistance are far from sufficient.\nHospitals recorded four more malnutrition-related deaths over the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 193 people, including 96 children, since the war began in October 2023, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\nJordan says aid convoy attacked by Israeli settlers\nJordan said Israeli settlers blocked roads and hurled stones at a convoy of four trucks carrying aid bound for Gaza after they drove across the border into the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israeli far-right activists have repeatedly sought to halt aid from entering Gaza.\nJordanian government spokesperson Mohammed al-Momani condemned the attack, which he said had shattered the windshields of the trucks, according to the Jordanian state-run Petra News Agency.\nThe Israeli military said security forces went to the scene to disperse the gathering and accompanied the trucks to their destination.\nHamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and abducted another 251. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals. Of the 50 still held in Gaza, around 20 are believed to be alive.\nIsrael\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children. It is part of the now largely defunct Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source for the number of war casualties.\nShurafa, Khaled and Melzer write for the Associated Press.

      "text": "Netanyahu denounces report that Israeli soldiers have orders to shoot at Palestinians seeking aid\n- Share via\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz emphatically rejected a report in the left-leaning Israeli daily Haaretz on Friday, which claimed Israeli soldiers were ordered to shoot at Palestinians approaching aid sites inside Gaza. They called the report\u2019s findings \u201cmalicious falsehoods designed to defame\u201d the military.\nMore than 500 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded while seeking food since the newly formed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began distributing aid in the territory about a month ago, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.\nPalestinian witnesses say Israeli troops have opened fire at crowds on the roads heading toward the sites. Reacting to the Haaretz piece, Israel\u2019s military confirmed that it was investigating incidents in which civilians had been harmed while approaching the sites. It rejected the article\u2019s allegations \u201cof deliberate fire toward civilians.\u201d\nThe foundation, which is backed by an American private contractor, has been distributing food boxes at four locations, mainly in the far south of Gaza, for the past month.\n\u201cGHF is not aware of any of these incidents but these allegations are too grave to ignore and we therefore call on Israel to investigate them and transparently publish the results in a timely manner,\u201d the group said in a social media post.\nPalestinians trying to find food have frequently encountered chaos and violence on their way to and on arrival at the aid sites. Tens of thousands are desperate for food after Israel imposed a 2 1/2 month siege on Gaza, blocking all food, water and medicine from entering the territory pending the setup of the GHF sites.\nThe bodies of eight people who died Friday had come to Shifa Hospital from a GHF site in Netzarim, although it was not immediately clear how they died, Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmyiha, the hospital\u2019s director, told the Associated Press. A GHF spokesperson challenged the report, saying they did not know of any incidents at or near their sites Friday.\nTwenty other bodies his hospital received Friday came from airstrikes across north Gaza, he said.\nThousands of Palestinians walk for hours to reach the hubs, moving through Israeli military zones where witnesses say Israeli troops regularly open fire with heavy barrages to control the crowds. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots.\nMohammad Fawzi, a displaced man from Rafah, told the AP that he was only able to get empty boxes, not food, from the aid site in the Shakoush area in Rafah when he trekked there early Thursday morning.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been shot at since 6 a.m. up until 10 a.m. just to get aid and only some people were able to receive it. There are martyrs and injured people. The situation is difficult,\u201d he said.\nThe group Doctors Without Borders on Friday condemned the distribution system as \u201ca slaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid\u201d and called for it to be immediately shut down.\nMore than 6,000 people have been killed and more than 20,000 injured in Gaza since the ceasefire collapsed on March 18. Since the war began, more than 56,000 people have been killed and 132,000 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\nThe Gaza Health Ministry doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants, but has said that women and children make up more than half the 56,000 dead. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing the militants of hiding among civilians, because they operate in populated areas.\nThe Israel-Hamas war started following the Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage. About 50 of them still remain in captivity in Gaza.\nThe latest deaths include six people killed and 10 wounded in Israeli strikes on a group of citizens near the Martyrs Roundabout in the Bureij Camp in central Gaza Strip, officials at Awda Hospital in Nuseirat said Friday.\nThe United Nations chief meanwhile urged leaders to show \u201cpolitical courage\u201d and agree to a ceasefire like the one forged between Israel and Iran.\nSecretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres also urged a return to the U.N.\u2019s long-tested distribution system for aid in Gaza, where he said Israeli military operations have created \u201ca humanitarian crisis of horrific proportions.\u201d\n\u201cThe search for food must never be a death sentence,\u201d Guterres stressed to U.N. reporters Friday.\nFrankel, Khaled and Shurafa write for the Associated Press.
