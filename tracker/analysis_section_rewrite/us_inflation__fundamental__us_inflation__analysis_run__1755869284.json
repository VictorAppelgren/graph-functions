      "feedback": "The analysis draft demonstrates a solid understanding of the macroeconomic landscape, but it could benefit from enhanced clarity and depth in several areas. First, strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking how tariff impacts translate into inflationary pressures and subsequently influence Fed policy decisions. Incorporate specific numerical data to quantify the inflation rates and job growth figures, enhancing the analysis's specificity. Additionally, ensure that the discussion aligns with the multi-year horizon focus by considering long-term implications of current trends, such as potential shifts in consumer behavior and structural changes in the labor market. Address the need for a more robust scenario structure by outlining alternative scenarios based on varying inflation and employment outcomes. Finally, increase citation density by referencing more sources to support claims, particularly regarding the Fed's historical responses to similar economic conditions. Overall, aim for a more nuanced conclusion that articulates base case expectations, key risks, and specific catalysts to monitor moving forward.",
