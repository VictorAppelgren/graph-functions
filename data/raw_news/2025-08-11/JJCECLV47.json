  "title": "On the front lines in eastern Ukraine, peace feels far away",
  "description": "Ukrainian soldiers on the front line doubt that peace talks can end the war with Russia",
  "content": "In a plastic-lined dugout where nearby blasts send dirt raining from the ceiling, Ukrainian soldiers say peace talks feel distant and unlikely to end the war. Explosions from Russian weapons \u2014 from glide bombs to artillery shells \u2014 thunder overhead, keeping the soldiers underground except when they fire the M777 howitzer buried near their trench.\n\nNothing on the Eastern Front suggests the fighting could end soon.\n\nSoldiers\u2019 skepticism over diplomatic peace efforts is rooted in months of what they see as broken U.S. promises to end the war quickly.\n\nRecent suggestions by President Trump that there will be some \u201c swapping of territories\u201d \u2014 and media reports that it would involve Ukrainian troops leaving the Donetsk region where they have fought for years defending every inch of land \u2014 have stirred confusion and rejection among the soldiers.\n\nMore likely than an end to the war, they say, is a brief pause in hostilities before Russia resumes the assault with greater force.\n\n\u201cAt minimum, the result would be to stop active fighting \u2014 that would be the first sign of some kind of settlement,\u201d said soldier Dmytro Loviniukov of the 148th brigade. \u201cRight now, that\u2019s not happening. And while these talks are taking place, they (the Russians) are only strengthening their positions on the front line.\u201d\n\nOn one artillery position, talk often turns to home. Many Ukrainian soldiers joined the army in the first days of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, leaving behind civilian jobs. Some thought they would serve only briefly. Others didn\u2019t think about the future \u2014 because at that moment, it didn\u2019t exist.\n\nIn the years since, many have been killed. Those who survived are in their fourth year of a grueling war, far removed from the civilian lives they once knew. With the war dragging on far longer than expected, there is no one to replace them as the Ukrainian army struggles with recruiting new people.\n\nThe army also cannot demobilize those who serve without risking the collapse of the front.\n\nThat is why soldiers watch for even the possibility of a pause in hostilities. When direct talks between Russia and Ukraine were held in Istanbul in May, the soldiers from the 148th brigade read the news with cautious hope, said a soldier with the call sign Bronson, who once worked as a tattoo artist.\n\nMonths later, hope has been replaced with dark humor. On the eve of a deadline that President Trump reportedly gave Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 one that has since vanished from the agenda amid talk of Friday\u2019s meeting in Alaska \u2014 Russian fire roared every minute for hours. Soldiers joked that the shelling was because the deadline was \u201crunning out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are on our land. We have no way back,\u201d said Loviniukov, the commander of the artillery group. \u201cWe stand here because there is no choice. No one else will come here to defend us.\u201d\n\nDozens of kilometers from the Zaporizhzhia region, north to the Donetsk area, heavy fighting grinds on toward Pokrovsk \u2014 now the epicenter of fighting.\n\nOnce home to about 60,000 people, the city has been under sustained Russian assault for months. The Russians have formed a pocket around Pokrovsk, though Ukrainian troops still hold the city and street fighting has yet to begin. Reports of Russian saboteurs entering the city started to appear almost daily, but the military says those groups have been neutralized.\n\nUkrainian soldiers of the Spartan brigade push through drills with full intensity, honing their skills for the battlefield in the Pokrovsk area.\n\nEverything at the training range, dozens of kilometers from the front, is designed to mirror real combat conditions \u2014 even the terrain. A thin strip of forest breaks up the vast fields of blooming sunflowers stretching into the distance until the next tree line appears.\n\nOne of the soldiers training there is a 35-year-old with the call sign Komrad, who joined the military recently. He says he has no illusions that the war will end soon.\n\n\u201cMy motivation is that there is simply no way back,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are in the military, you have to fight. If we\u2019re here, we need to cover our brothers in arms.\u201d\n\nFor Serhii Filimonov, commander of the \u201cDa Vinci Wolves\u201d battalion of the 59th brigade, the war\u2019s end is nowhere in sight, and current news doesn\u2019t influence the struggle to find enough resources to equip the unit that is fighting around Pokrovsk.\n\n\u201cWe are preparing for a long war. We have no illusions that Russia will stop,\u201d he said, speaking at his field command post. \u201cThere may be a ceasefire, but there will be no peace.\u201d\n\nFilimonov dismissed recent talk of exchanging territory or signing agreements as temporary fixes at best.\n\n\u201cRussia will not abandon its goal of capturing all of Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will attack again. The big question is what security guarantees we get \u2014 and how we hit pause.\u201d\n\nA soldier with the call sign Mirche from the 68th brigade said that whenever there is a new round of talks, the hostilities intensify around Pokrovsk \u2014 Russia\u2019s key priority during this summer\u2019s campaign.\n\nWhenever peace talks begin, \u201cthings on the front get terrifying,\u201d he said.\n\nArhirova writes for the Associated Press.

      "text": "Trump promised to end the Ukraine war, but neither side is ready\n- Share via\nEarlier this month, a full moon blocked Mars from view. Historically, some have taken that as a sign for peace as Mars has been the \u201cplanet of war and conflict in many cultures, from ancient China to ancient Rome,\u201d according to science writer Rebecca Boyle.\nAt least then there may be celestial hope for President Trump\u2019s nearly two-year-old promise to end the war in Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019ll have that done in 24 hours,\u201d he told a CNN town hall in May 2023. He doubled down during a presidential debate in September 2024: \u201cI will get it settled before I even become president.\u201d But then the bravado behind those boastful campaign pledges lost steam this month. Trump\u2019s nominee as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, pushed the goalpost for peace back \u201c100 days\u201d in an interview, from Inauguration Day\u2019s Jan. 20 to early May.\nThe president-elect\u2019s vow to stop the war may lead to concessions to Putin, including divisions of territory, which have a bloody history.\nWhatever deadline you set, ending the war in Ukraine is the first test of the Trump administration. Unfortunately the new president is learning that there\u2019s no such thing as a drive-by peace deal. Whatever hope the solar system may offer, all real wars come down to hard ground truths.\nThe hard ground truth in Ukraine is that, as Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower once put it, \u201csometimes it just gets down to the dirty job of killing until one side or the other cracks.\u201d Right now the Russians are far closer to cracking than the Ukrainians are. While the Russians can absorb more pain, they do not want to take more; the Ukrainians have more limited resources, yet are willing to take more pain because they\u2019re fighting for their country.\nIf the incoming administration abandons Kyiv, Russia\u2019s ambitions will explode and nuclear weapons will proliferate.\nRussia currently holds 18% of Ukraine\u2019s sovereign territory (terrain the size of Ohio). Ukraine has retaken 54% of what the Russians held at one point. The fighting over three years has cost Ukraine more than 400,000 dead and injured. Russia\u2019s toll is more than 700,000 dead and injured.\nThis cost is high yet sustainable on both sides. The Ukrainians have absorbed approximately 11,000 total casualties per month. The Russians, roughly 20,000 total casualties a month. The strategist Edward Luttwak has estimated, \u201cthe number of male Ukrainians that annually reach military age is at least 235,000 or 20,000 per month\u201d; but \u201cevery month more than 100,000 Russian males reach military age.\u201d So this war is grinding up more than half of Ukraine\u2019s young men, and one-fifth of Russia\u2019s (setting aside women\u2019s considerable contribution to the war effort, particularly for Ukraine).\nKyiv\u2019s push north is precisely the kind of action that stands the best chance of discouraging Vladimir Putin and eventually bringing this war to an end.\nBut that\u2019s what war does. It trades lives for objectives. It is painful and it is awful and it is crude, but this is also the grim arithmetic by which big wars are won.\nSuch math is taught to every Ukrainian basic trainee, that everyone \u201con frontline duty must take the life of at least one Russian soldier, preferably more, before dying himself,\u201d as recently reported. While that remarkable rate doesn\u2019t guarantee victory, over time it can have a devastating impact. That\u2019s why most wars are won by outlasting the other side, as the historian Cathal Nolan has pointed out.\nThe Russians have admitted they\u2019re being outlasted. Last fall, they recruited North Korean troops into their ranks, alongside the convicts, mercenaries and poor kids from Siberia who make up the rest of its remaining army. Death payments alone cost the Russian government $30 billion over a recent one-year period. About 40% of Russia\u2019s national budget now goes to the military.\nMorale is with Ukraine. Their units wear patches that read \u201cUkraine or Death.\u201d Their generals pronounce: \u201cWe\u2019ll fight the Russians to the death, until the last Ukrainian.\u201d Their soldiers, unarmed and about to be executed, smoke cigarettes and shout: \u201cGlory to Ukraine.\u201d And they know they\u2019re fighting for their children against an adversary that has stolen well over 19,000 Ukrainian kids since the war began.\nSo how could the U.S. persuade Ukraine to end the war now? Why would Kyiv make a deal? This is the first problem for Trump and Kellogg. While the Russians may be closer to caving, it\u2019s not clear that either side\u2019s pain has become intolerable. That means bringing parties to the table motivated by desire, not necessity, which makes meaningful concessions near impossible.\nIf the U.S. could get the two nations to agree, what would the ideal peace deal look like? Twin American interests are at stake that sit in tension with one another, like a massive foreign policy seesaw. Maximizing Ukrainian independence to stand for international borders on one end, versus maximizing d\u00e9tente with Russia to hedge against the growing threat from China.\nA durable balance is key. Giving Ukraine all it wants would provoke Russia and throw it further over to the Chinese. Giving Russia too much would embolden it to go again, this time after Moldova, Georgia, maybe at NATO\u2019s edge. The only real deal, then, is a balanced peace that neither emboldens or provokes. That\u2019s probably something that freezes terrain in place with some creative, NATO-by-another-name security guarantee that ensures Ukraine\u2019s survival and current sovereignty \u2014 perhaps stationing troops of major European nations in Ukraine to create a \u201chuman tripwire,\u201d as America has done in South Korea for many decades.\nPeace is tough because war is tough. Wars don\u2019t end on schedule, for Inauguration Day, or when you say so. Thinking that would be like hoping to bring peace by howling at the moon.\nML Cavanaugh is a co-founder of the Modern War Institute at West Point and author of the forthcoming book \u201cBest Scar Wins: How You Can Be More Than You Were Before.\u201d @MLCavanaugh"

      "text": "In the war\u2019s aftermath, Ukraine will face a new kind of instability\n- Share via\nThe Russian war in Ukraine, the most devastating military engagement in Europe since 1945, has persisted for three years, and the prospect of its resolution \u2014 with the Trump administration opening talks with Russia \u2014 has not generated widespread optimism.\nIn a recent interview with the Financial Times, Polish President Andrzej Duda warned that the war\u2019s conclusion, if and when it comes, could unleash a wave of organized crime flooding into Poland and then spreading across Europe and even into the U.S. His concerns echo a sentiment long whispered in Western political circles. He compared the situation to the 1990s in Russia, when the return of veterans from the Soviet-Afghanistan war fueled violence across the former USSR.\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry pushed back, calling his remarks unfair: \u201cUkrainian soldiers and veterans are not a threat but a factor of security for Ukraine, Poland and all of Europe.\u201d\nAs Trump grants Putin his main wish to end war in Ukraine, Kyiv and Europe voice anger at not being included in proposed talks.\nDuda\u2019s comparison, however, may understate the dangers ahead. The Soviet war in Afghanistan lasted a decade but didn\u2019t produce the level of social upheaval that Russia\u2019s invasion has inflicted on Ukraine. The country\u2019s military now numbers 980,000, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky, and hundreds of thousands of battle-hardened and battle-scarred soldiers will return to civilian life \u2014 many with missing limbs, many more with deep psychological wounds \u2014 and all to a country in ruins. Where will they go? What will they do?\nUkraine has already experienced the downstream effects of post-war mental health problems. In April 2018, when Russia\u2019s aggression wasn\u2019t called a war but a \u201cterrorist\u201d action in the Donbas, data revealed that more than 1,000 Ukraine veterans of those less-intense battles had committed suicide.\nNow the Ukrainian Health Ministry estimates that nearly 15 million people \u2014 in a population of less than 40 million \u2014 will require psychological support due to the war.\nUkraine\u2019s recent losses come amid uncertainty over whether the United States will keep providing vital military aid against Russia\u2019s invasion.\nYet the nation\u2019s shattered economy \u2014 its public debt reached $166.1 billion in December \u2014 raises serious doubts about its ability to fund essential services, including mental health programs. Last year, amid much fanfare, Ukraine legalized medical cannabis in part to help troops and civilians suffering from PTSD and other war-related mental illnesses. But medical marijuana is little more than a Band-Aid on a bullet wound for a military in which, according to one study, there is just one psychologist for every 400-500 service members.\nBefore the war, there were an estimated 4 million firearms in Ukraine, most of them unregistered, and an untold number circulating on the black market. After the invasion, gun ownership laws were liberalized and Zelensky promised that the government would give a weapon to anyone who wanted to defend the country. In the Kyiv area alone, 18,000 rifles were distributed to civilians, and homefront militias were encouraged. When thousands of active duty troops are demobilized, military-grade weapons may add to the increase in armed civilians and the risks of higher crime rates.\nVice President JD Vance tells European officials, \u2018In Washington, there is a new sheriff in town,\u2019 lectures them on free speech and illegal migration.\nDespite the powderkeg potential, the Ukrainian government seems more focused on political maneuvering \u2014 both in domestic power struggles and international diplomacy \u2014 than on preparing for the war\u2019s aftermath. Officials frequently make statements about global politics and security alliances, yet meaningful efforts to address veterans\u2019 reintegration and welfare remain conspicuously lacking.\nA peace agreement perceived as a capitulation could further erode national morale that is already at a low point, with falling troop levels and Russia\u2019s recent front-line gains in the fighting. History shows that in such moments often public disillusionment grows, weakening confidence in leadership. During these periods, extreme factions may emerge, stoking unrest and upending a fragile order.\nWhen Russia launched its full-on invasion in February 2022, Ukrainians united under symbols that had previously divided them. The slogan Slava Ukraini! (Glory to Ukraine), once associated with ultra-right-wing nationalist movements during World War II, was embraced nationwide, even in regions where nationalism had been controversial.\nAs Eisenhower once said of how conflicts end, \u2018sometimes it just gets down to the dirty job of killing until one side or the other cracks.\u2019\nBut in 2025, extreme nationalist fervor has waned. This could be a temporary lull before another eruption of unrest, provoked by post-war trauma, hardship and disillusionment. That, combined with an armed population and a generation of young men forged in war could threaten Ukraine as much as Russian aggression has.\nIt seems certain that once the war ends, Ukraine will face a new battle \u2014 internal strife. Vladimir Putin is undoubtedly factoring this into any peace deal. What he failed to achieve through his \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d he may attempt to achieve from within.\nUkraine will need significant Western support to navigate these challenges. Financial aid, infrastructure development and comprehensive mental health services will be crucial to reintegrate veterans and maintain stability.\nYet support for Ukraine \u201cuntil it wins\u201d has been waning in Western Europe and in America. A recent Guardian poll highlights a sharp decline in enthusiasm, coinciding with increasing doubts about U.S. foreign and military aid. Whether allies will step up to prevent a post-war collapse in Ukraine \u2014 or let it unravel from within \u2014 remains an open question.\nPeace may come, but there is a real concern that the war\u2019s aftermath could be almost as destabilizing for Ukraine as its beginning.\nSergey Maidukov, author of \u201cLife on the Run: One Family\u2019s Search for Peace in War-torn Ukraine\u201d among other books, is based in Kyiv.\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

      "text": "Western aid isn\u2019t prolonging the war in Ukraine. This is\n- Share via\nKyiv, Ukraine \u2014 We hear this refrain a lot these days: \u201cAmerica is only prolonging the war by helping Ukraine. We need diplomacy.\u201d\nTo Ukrainian ears, however, \u201cdiplomacy\u201d sounds like a euphemism for \u201cUkraine surrendering and ceasing to exist.\u201d\nAdmittedly, an honest question underlies the refrain: Why can\u2019t Ukraine seek peace with Russia?\nBut here\u2019s how the question could be rephrased: Why not give away huge swaths of sovereign territory to a brutal and corrupt regime? Why not stay away from NATO, allow the Russian sanctions to be lifted, create a demilitarized zone (sacrificing more territory, of course) and aspire to mutual trust?\nThe attack unfolded a day before Western leaders who have backed Ukraine were scheduled to begin a three-day NATO summit in Washington.\nThe answers are obvious, given the reality on the ground and in the fevered mind of Vladimir Putin, especially this week, after Russia bombed the children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv in a massive daytime missile attack that killed at least 39 across Ukraine.\nFor a decade, Russia\u2019s President Putin has played the West\u2019s fear of a European war like a master. The West initially gave in to his threats and persistently kept Ukraine out of NATO (God forbid we trigger a war!) and thus made the invasion of 2014, and the ongoing full-scale war, starting in 2022, inevitable. Ukraine was barred from the world\u2019s most successful defense alliance and was vulnerable to major aggression, which is exactly what the Kremlin wanted.\nSince then, exercises in \u201cescalation management\u201d and major restrictions on defense aid to Ukraine have not brought Putin to reason as he carries out the largest European war of aggression since Adolf Hitler. Instead, those limits have cost Ukraine a chance to disable Russia, and instead enabled a long war of attrition.\nUkraine\u2019s army retreats from positions as Russia gets closer to seizing strategically important town\nUkraine\u2019s military says it retreated from a neighborhood on the outskirts of a strategically key town in the Donetsk region Russia has reduced to rubble.\nHalf-measures of support have helped Putin to recover from his military\u2019s early failure in northern Ukraine, as well as helping him to adapt to sanctions, to make the war profitable for his elites, to find allies and new markets, and to prepare Russia for perpetual war.\nUntil very recently, Ukraine was strictly banned from using the West\u2019s weapons to attack military targets inside Russian territory, a red line that effectively tied Ukraine\u2019s hands. Did the Kremlin appreciate the gesture? It did \u2014 the Russian military used its safe haven status to prepare new offensives and devastating bombing campaigns unchallenged.\nStarting last fall, the chorus demanding a \u201cdiplomatic solution\u201d grew louder on the know-nothing right in America, and defense aid foundered for six critical months in Congress, creating a gargantuan shortage of munitions in the Ukrainian military.\nPresident Biden publicly apologized to Ukraine\u2019s president for a congressional holdup of military aid that let Russia make battlefield gains.\nThe lack of U.S. help did nothing to precipitate a halt in hostilities or bring about the \u201ccompromise\u201d that Putin hypocritically chatters about in his periodic surrender ultimatums to Ukraine.\nInstead, it expedited Ukraine\u2019s tragic loss of the city of Avdiivka to the Russians in early 2024, as well as Moscow\u2019s overconfident spring offensive in Kharkiv. Ukraine\u2019s front line did not fall, as many predicted, thanks to the valor and inventiveness of the Ukrainian military.\nRussia responded to the delay of aid from the U.S. by tripling its missile attacks on Ukraine\u2019s electricity and heating infrastructure, exploiting Ukraine\u2019s under-resourced air defense. Now the lion\u2019s share of Ukraine\u2019s energy production and distribution system is destroyed. Ukrainians go most of the day without electricity, and only heaven knows what nightmare awaits us in the winter to come.\nAmid worsening Ukraine war outlook, an infusion of American military aid is seen as crucial in the fight against Russian invaders. Will it be enough?\nDecision-makers in Washington keep following the same dangerous script over and over. Ukraine asks for weapons and the response comes back: providing X ammunition or Y missile system would cross a red line and cause an escalation. Months-long deliberations follow; the situation in Ukraine worsens. Belated permission is granted and the weapons \u2014 artillery, armored vehicles, rocket systems, missiles, air defense, fighter jets \u2014 arrive late. Then the whole scenario is repeated, as Ukraine plays catch-up and suffers.\nWhen Ukrainian troops finally got HIMARS rocket launchers in the summer of 2022, they were able to stunningly derail Russia\u2019s logistics, undermine Russia\u2019s immense artillery power, halt a Russian offensive and help precipitate the liberation of Kherson later that year.\nThe U.S.-made PATRIOT air defense system was an absolute no-go until late 2022, when it could finally be used against Russia\u2019s air force. The long-belated arrival of ATACMS missiles, declared off limits for more than two years, eventually did devastating damage to Russia\u2019s airfields and air defense systems in occupied Crimea. All without \u201cescalating\u201d blowback.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson does the right thing allowing vote on separate Ukraine aid bill despite threats from hard-liners in his conference.\nAfter tallying up the red lines crossed and the consequences, the Kremlin\u2019s nuclear saber-rattling begins to sound a bit tinny, doesn\u2019t it? As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has noted, Putin may be crazy, but his instinct for self-preservation is alive and well. We need to be brave enough to call his bluff.\nPlacating Putin is not the way to peace; it\u2019s an open invitation to eliminate Ukraine as a nation, absorb its territory and its resources, and install Russian aggressors directly on Europe\u2019s borders.\nPutin will stop only when he is made to, with a proper and powerful response that defeats his ability to fight on. Ukrainians held off Russia\u2019s attempted decapitating blitz on Kyiv in February and March 2022 with just that kind of all-out effort.\nThe International Criminal Court says it has issued arrest warrants for Russia\u2019s former defense minister and its military chief of staff.\nCommentators, politicians and decision-makers in Congress and elsewhere in the West need to stop ignoring the reality of what is needed to end the Russian war in Ukraine. Either that, or openly admit that they are working to aid the Russian aggressor\u2019s victory.\nProviding Ukraine with the support and weapons it needs is not about prolonging the war. It is about stopping Putin by speaking the only language he understands.\nIllia Ponomarenko is a former defense and security reporter at the Kyiv Post and subsequently a co-founder of the Kyiv Independent.

  "argos_summary": "Ukrainian soldiers express deep skepticism about the prospects for peace talks to end the ongoing war with Russia, citing a history of broken promises and the likelihood of intensified hostilities rather than a genuine resolution. As the conflict drags on, soldiers reflect on their sacrifices and the grim reality of a prolonged struggle, with many fearing that any ceasefire would merely serve as a pause before renewed attacks. The situation is compounded by concerns over the aftermath of the war, including the potential for internal instability as demobilized soldiers return to a devastated economy, raising fears of crime and social unrest.",
