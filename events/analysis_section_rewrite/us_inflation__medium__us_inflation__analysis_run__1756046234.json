      "feedback": "Strong start linking the Trump‑aligned policy slate, RNC leadership, and debt dynamics to a 3–6 month risk/reward window, and you correctly pull forward cross‑asset signals (Pacaso/Range in private markets, HeartSciences AI‑ECG in healthcare, UAS sector data) to anchor a scenario map. To upgrade to world‑class, tighten the causal chain, normalize the framing around a formal scenario map with explicit timing, and ground every claim in the IDs you list; also prune tangential items (e.g., tires) that don’t drive the core macro narrative. Specifically: (1) build a crisp scenario map with Base Case, and 2–3 Alternatives, each with (i) triggers and windows (e.g., Week 0–2: RNC messaging consolidation; Month 1–2: legislative/SCOTUS or CBO scoring signals on the Big Beautiful Bill; Month 3–6: debt trajectory and inflation prints), (ii) invalidations, and (iii) asset/sector reactions (rates, equities, private markets). Tie triggers to precise props from the sources: Gruters’ RNC chairmanship and “ride the president” messaging and election‑integrity priorities (EPJYXB7DX); the 4.4 trillion in tax relief and $4 trillion debt impulse from OBBA framing (EPJYXB7DX); the 3.4 trillion package and its Medicaid/food‑stamps tradeoffs (EPJYXB7DX, plus Fox Business Medicaid note in Source 8); private markets signals such as Pacaso’s 21% YoY growth in gross real estate volume, 40% of Americans wanting a vacation home, and expansion to 10 destinations with a $1.8T vacation‑home opportunity (UPV3X2MQ6); HeartSciences’ Medicare/FDA cadence (FDA submission 2026, Medicare reimbursement starting Jan 2025) (ILYC1M41F); and the UAS data—97% nationwide growth in UAS jobs to 1,400 in 2025 with $105k+ average pay (FOM34PUWA). (2) Quantify and normalize numbers across the piece: present a single, source‑backed set of base numbers (e.g., 1,400 UAS jobs; $105,912 avg salary; Pacaso 21% YoY growth; 40% patent‑driven demand; 4–4.4T tax/debt increments; 3.4T legislative package; 11.8M uninsured explosion as a policy risk if cited from the private‑market pieces—note the source) and avoid mixing non‑core items (Douglas Tires, Gameflip, etc.) into the main causal chain unless you explicitly frame them as inflation/consumption proxies. (3) Strengthen first‑principles grounding: explicitly model the debt channel (deficits raised by the 3.4T package, potential 4T debt trajectory) versus a productivity impulse (Range/AI, 1–1.5% productivity uplift plausible per your cite; translate to GDP, inflation, and rate paths) and then show how that balance would alter discount rates and equity risk premia in the 3–6 month horizon. (4) Resolve conflicts and cite correctly: acknowledge AUVSI’s numbers are defunct and rely on the Grand Forks/ND data (1,400 jobs, $105k) for a consistent baseline (FOM34PUWA); keep Pacaso’s $1.8T vacation‑home market claim and 10‑destination expansion (UPV3X2MQ6); anchor HeartSciences’ FDA/Medicare timing (ILYC1M41F); and ground policy claims to EPJYXB7DX. (5) Improve structure and readability within the constraint: present one base case, two alts, clearly labeled risk factors, watch‑list signals, and a confidence assessment at the end, with every claim tethered to the IDs above. The result will be a tighter, defensible, numbers‑driven 3–6 month view that cleanly separates macro policy, sector signals, and private‑market catalysts, and yields a reproducible path from trigger to invalidation. Citations to preserve: EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, FOM34PUWA, ILYC1M41F, V8TEZOR8R.",
