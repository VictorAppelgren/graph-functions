      "summary": "The speaker discusses the current state of the investment‑grade credit market, noting robust demand across rating levels and a cycle‑type spread environment after a late‑summer supply issue. They highlight that while valuations are tight, idiosyncratic risks are rising, especially in cyclical and tariff‑exposed sectors that haven’t fully benefited from recent recoveries. The speaker advises caution in avoiding weaker sectors while still remaining optimistic about spread expansion, citing firm technicals and solid fundamentals at the peak of the credit cycle.",
