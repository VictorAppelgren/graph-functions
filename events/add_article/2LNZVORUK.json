      "summary": "Salesforce forecasts third‑quarter revenue below estimates as clients cut cloud spending amid macro uncertainty, prompting a 4% after‑hours decline in its shares. The company boosts its buyback program by $20 billion to $50 billion, while cutting 4,000 support jobs as AI tools take a larger role. Revenue is projected at $10.24‑$10.29 billion, slightly below analysts’ $10.29 billion average, but EPS guidance remains in line. The outlook reflects broader IT budget restraint and geopolitical pressures.",
