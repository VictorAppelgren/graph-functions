  "content": "Prince William and Prince Harry are reportedly preparing to cross paths at their cousin\u2019s upcoming wedding and are putting plans in place to avoid any interactions.\n\nPeter Phillips, the son of Princess Anne, announced to Hello that he is engaged to partner Harriet Sperling. While wedding plans were not revealed, sources are already speculating about what this could mean for estranged members of the Royal Family, namely Prince Harry and Prince William.\n\u2022 None Experts Reveal What Prince Archie's Latest Endeavor Says About His Budding Personality\n\nA source from the palace exclusively told Rob Shuter\u2019s #ShuterScoop that Harry and William\u2019s camps have already laid out some demands.\n\n\u201cThe feud is still active and raw,\u201d the insider said. \u201cThey made it clear: no photos, no interactions, and absolutely no sitting next to one another.\u201d\n\nAccording to sources, William\u2019s team is pushing for the future king to receive a top-tier place at the ceremony. \u201cThey insisted his seat reflect his future role as king,\u201d one source explained. \u201cAnd that means Harry\u2019s position must be visibly beneath his. They don\u2019t even try to hide the hierarchy anymore.\u201d\n\nIn return, Harry\u2019s team is requesting separate arrival times, private security, and insists that he won\u2019t appear in any official portraits with his estranged older brother. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be part of some fake PR reunion,\u201d claims a source close to Harry. \u201cHe\u2019s not interested in pretending things are fine when they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be in the same room\u2014but not in the same frame,\u201d a family source said. \u201cNo speeches, no toasts, no warm moments. Just frost.\u201d\n\nThe brothers both have a close relationship with their older cousin, who has been somewhat of an older brother figure to them. Long before their feud, Harry and William attended his 2008 wedding to Autumn Kelly, from whom he split in 2019.\n\nHowever, amid their ongoing feud, Harry and William have gone to great lengths to avoid one another. In August 2024, they both attended the funeral of their uncle, Lord Robert Fellowes, but did not interact.\n\nRecently, royal insiders have speculated whether King Charles and Harry\u2019s teams being in contact with one another could bring a feud between the brothers to an end. \u201cI think that Harry\u2019s relationship with his brother is a different beast than his relationship with his father,\u201d royal expert Kristen Meinzer told Us Weekly. \u201cBut perhaps if Charles warms more to Harry, William will feel compelled to follow his lead.\u201d\n\nBefore you go, click here to see the best photos of Princess Diana playing with William and Harry.\n\u2022 None A Look Back at Martha Stewart's Incredible Life, From Her Early Modeling Career to Her Media Empire at 84\n\u2022 None Join These 10 Celebrity Book Clubs & Read Along with Your Favorite Stars\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.

Separate seating. Separate lives.\nThe royal family\u2019s ongoing cold war is about to steal the spotlight at what should have been a joyful event.\n#ShuterScoop has exclusively learned that Prince William and Prince Harry will both attend cousin Peter Phillips\u2019 upcoming wedding\u2014but have each issued strict demands to ensure they remain as far apart as possible.\n\u201cThe feud is still active and raw,\u201d says a senior palace insider. \u201cThey made it clear: no photos, no interactions, and absolutely no sitting next to one another.\u201d\nAccording to sources, William\u2019s team pushed for top-tier placement at the ceremony. \u201cThey insisted his seat reflect his future role as king,\u201d one source explains. \u201cAnd that means Harry\u2019s position must be visibly beneath his.

It\u2019s a royal standoff in formalwear.\nEXCLUSIVE: JUSTIN BIEBER BLASTED FOR USING BABY SON TO SAVE HIS FLOP ALBUM\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fatherhood. It\u2019s a marketing stunt.\u201d\nJustin Bieber is facing a wave of backlash after placing his newborn son front and center in the music video for his underperforming single \u201cYukon.\u201d\nThe track, from his troubled comeback album Swag, has failed to chart meaningfully\u2014and now sources say Justin\u2019s team is \u201cin meltdown mode,\u201d using baby Jack in a last-ditch effort to stir sympathy and clicks.\n\u201cThe video isn\u2019t a tribute to fatherhood. It\u2019s damage control,\u201d says a source close to production. \u201cThe baby\u2019s inclusion was strategic. They\u2019re trying to save a flop.\u201d\nIn the video, Bieber\u2014shirtless and emotional\u2014sings on a yacht while his son floats on a tiny raft and is cradled in several carefully lit scenes. Fans and industry insiders alike are calling it out.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about love. It\u2019s about optics,\u201d says one critic. \u201cHe promised to protect that child\u2019s privacy. Now the kid\u2019s being used to sell downloads.\u201d\nThe controversy comes as Swag continues to sink, with fewer than 300,000 total streams and no tour or physical release date. \u201cThey\u2019re out of tricks,\u201d the source adds. \u201cThis was the Hail Mary\u2014and they used a baby to throw it.\u201d\nEXCLUSIVE: LINDSAY LOHAN\u2019S CAREER HANGS IN THE BALANCE \u2014 \u2018FREAKIER FRIDAY\u2019 IS HER LAST SHOT\nIf this bombs, she\u2019s headed straight back to made-for-TV Christmas hell.\nLindsay Lohan\u2019s big comeback is riding on a single movie\u2014and insiders say the pressure has never been higher.\nDisney\u2019s Freakier Friday sees Lohan reuniting with Jamie Lee Curtis in a sequel nearly two decades in the making. But this time, she\u2019s playing the mom\u2014and the stakes are very real.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just another role,\u201d says a source close to the production. \u201cThis is the last shot at a Hollywood return. If it doesn\u2019t hit, she\u2019s done.\u201d\nLohan has gone all in\u2014taking acting classes, hiring media coaches, even overhauling her image. Critics who\u2019ve seen early cuts say she gives a strong performance, but the film itself has a nostalgia problem.\n\u201cIt leans too heavily on the original,\u201d one reviewer says. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, but thin. She\u2019s the best thing in it\u2014but that may not be enough.\u201d\nBox office numbers will tell the real story. \u201cThere\u2019s no next opportunity lined up,\u201d says an insider. \u201cIf audiences don\u2019t show up, she\u2019ll be back making holiday movies on Hallmark channel.\u201d\nEXCLUSIVE: JENNIFER ANISTON\u2019S NEW MAN HAS A DISABILITY \u2014 AND SHE DOESN\u2019T CARE WHAT YOU THINK\nHe walks with a limp. She walks beside him. That\u2019s all that matters.\nJim Curtis, Jennifer Aniston\u2019s new boyfriend, isn\u2019t the Hollywood prototype. He walks with a noticeable limp due to a serious spinal condition. And now that paparazzi photos have made that detail public, the world is watching with judgment instead of understanding.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting how quickly people go from curious to cruel,\u201d says a source close to the actress. \u201cJennifer doesn\u2019t care about the limp. She cares about the man.\u201d\nCurtis, a former Wall Street star turned motivational speaker, has built a second act based on resilience and integrity. Friends describe him as \u201cbrilliant, grounded, and incredibly kind.\u201d\nStill, online speculation has been rampant. Some claim Jennifer is dating \u201cbeneath her level.\u201d Others question if Curtis can \u201ckeep up.\u201d\n\u201cPeople still treat disability like a punchline,\u201d the source says. \u201cBut Jennifer\u2019s not here for anyone\u2019s ignorance.\u201d\nThe message is clear: Curtis walks differently\u2014but with strength. And Jennifer Aniston is proud to walk beside him.\n#ShuterScoop"

      "text": "When Prince Harry turned 36 in 2020, it was an equally celebratory and reflective moment for the newly independent royal. At age 36, his beloved mother Princess Diana died in a tragic car accident involving paparazzi, taking her from young sons Prince William and Harry far too soon. A doting mother, Diana was often seen bonding with young William and Harry, her two beloved boys with Prince Charles, and while Diana\u2019s time as a royal may have been complicated, marked by media scandals and her ultimate divorce from Charles in 1996, her legacy as a mother is not. On this day, we\u2019re honoring Diana\u2019s best moments as a mom, as Harry will always remember her: from ski trips to water slides, first days of school, and more photos of Diana and the boys that we\u2019ll never forget.\nFrom his decision to step back from the royal family with Meghan Markle to his dedication to carrying on her charity work in Lesotho and beyond, it\u2019s clear how much Harry has been influenced by Diana\u2019s own path as a royal. And as he and William have taken on fatherhood, they\u2019ve only been more reminded of aspects of their childhood with Diana that they\u2019d like to carry on.\nFor William, that\u2019s meant raising George, Charlotte, and Louis in Kensington Palace, where he and young Harry grew up with Diana, while for Harry, that\u2019s meant raising Archie out of the public eye and giving him as much normalcy as possible, another goal of Diana\u2019s throughout. Looking back on these photos of the three of them, we know Diana would be so proud of both her boys \u2014 and hope that, no matter what their differences, they\u2019ll always find their way back to this close bond as brothers.\nHarry and William have have, in many ways, devoted their legacies to ensuring Diana\u2019s effect on the royal family would not be forgotten.

      "text": "Prince Harry\u2019s Feud With Prince William Is a \u2018Different Beast\u2019 Than With His Father, Royal Expert Says\nPrince Harry\u2019s ongoing feud with his brother, Prince William, is a far different animal than his rift with his father, King Charles.\n\u201cI think that Harry\u2019s relationship with his brother is a different beast than his relationship with his father,\u201d royal expert Kristen Meinzer exclusively tells Us Weekly. \u201cBut perhaps if Charles warms more to Harry, William will feel compelled to follow his lead.\u201d\nThe Duke of Sussex\u2019s fallout with his brother and father hit a fever pitch in 2020, when Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped away from their duties as senior members of the royal family. After the pair relocated across the pond in Montecito, California, Prince Harry published a tell-all memoir, Spare, reportedly further angering members of his family.\nAfter losing his U.K. security protection, Prince Harry has been vocal about his rift with his father, particularly after the King of England\u2019s cancer diagnosis.\n\u201cThere have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family,\u201d Harry told the BBC in a tell-all interview shortly after he lost a legal battle to regain his U.K. security, adding that \u201cit would be nice to reconcile\u201d but that his father \u201cwon\u2019t speak to me.\u201d\nThe Duke of Sussex later claimed that his father could reinstate his security protection if he chose to do so.\n\u201cThere is a lot of control and ability in my father\u2019s hands,\u201d Harry alleged. \u201cUltimately, this whole thing could be resolved through him. Not necessarily by intervening, but by stepping aside, allowing the experts [to] do what is necessary.\u201d\nKing Charles, however, has remained tight-lipped regarding his fractured relationship with his son.\n\u201cIt really does look like Charles is taking the \u2018Keep Calm and Carry On\u2019 axiom to a whole other level, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Christopher Anderson, author of numerous books about the royal family, told Us in May. \u201cThe King is only hewing to a long-standing royal practice of not dignifying something by commenting on it. The Palace does not want to give oxygen to Harry\u2019s remarks. King Charles has a lot on his plate as it is \u2014 there is no upside to his getting into a public quarrel with his son.\u201d\nAs for his relationship with his brother, a source told Us that Prince William is \u201cdone\u201d with his younger brother.\n\u201cWilliam doesn\u2019t talk about Harry anymore,\u201d the insider exclusively revealed. \u201cEveryone knows it\u2019s a subject that they shouldn\u2019t bring up, so he hasn\u2019t brought up the interview and won\u2019t.\u201d\nThe source added, \u201cWilliam is done with Harry. When he becomes King, everybody thinks the divide will become even wider.\u201d\nPrince William and Prince Harry\u2019s Royal Rift: \u2018There\u2019s No Turning Back\u2019\nDr. Gail Saltz, a mental health professional, told Us that same month that the rift within the royal family is \u201ca tragedy,\u201d especially because \u201cpublic perception\u201d has taken \u201cprecedence over the private relationship.\u201d\n\u201cHarry and William are the only brothers they\u2019ll ever have,\" Saltz said. \"Charles is the only father Harry will ever have. These are essential human relationships.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cThere are two different relationship lines here. There\u2019s the public one because they are a working family, a royal family with a historical and tabloid place. And then there\u2019s the private family relationship.\u201d\nIn an apparent effort to mend his fractured relationships with members of the monarchy, Prince Harry recently shared his schedule with his father \u2014 an attempt to ensure none of his high-profile visits overshadow the royal family.\n\u201cI think any communication is good,\u201d Meinzer exclusively tells Us. \u201cIt shows that things have not completely broken down between father and son, and that Harry, in particular, wants to mend fences.\u201d"

      "text": "Peter Phillips and Harriet Sperling have confirmed their engagement after a year of dating. The couple shared their news on Friday exclusively with HELLO! and released two photos which showed off Harriet's stunning engagement ring.\nA statement issued for the couple by Gerard Franklin, read: \"Mr Peter Phillips, the son of HRH The Princess Royal and Captain Mark Phillips and Ms Harriet Sperling, daughter of the late Mr Rupert Sanders and Mrs Mary Sanders of Gloucestershire, have today confirmed their official engagement.\n\"Both families were informed jointly of the announcement and were delighted with the wonderful news of their engagement. Their Majesties The King and Queen, The Prince and Princess of Wales have been informed of the announcement. No date has been officially set for the wedding.\"\nHarriet looked gorgeous in the photo, wearing a frilly white top and skirt, while her diamond ring sparkled as she proudly showed it off. She gazed lovingly at her husband-to-be, who wore a plaid top for the occasion.\nHELLO's royal editor, Emily Nash, said: \"This is wonderful news for Peter and Harriet, but also the wider royal family. Peter is close to the King and to his cousins and Harriet seems to have been warmly welcomed into the fold.\"\nMeanwhile, royal photographer James Whatling, who has photographed Peter and Harriet several times, tells HELLO!: \"We were waiting for this news. You can't watch this couple for too long without noticing how close they are, they\u2019re so tactile and they're clearly so in love. It was only a matter of time.\"\nDating history\nPeter, who is the eldest child of Princess Anne, is believed to have started dating Harriet in 2024. The couple reportedly met at a sporting event.\nThe pair made their debut at the Badminton Horse Trials in May 2024, and they were seen walking hand-in-hand as they supported Peter's sister, Zara Tindall. At the time, a friend of Peter's said the royal has met someone \"recently\" and they are \"spending time together\", but it's too early to be anything more at this stage.\nAt Royal Ascot the following month, she met Peter's uncle, King Charles. Harriet, who is an NHS paediatrician and freelance writer, was seen drinking champagne with the monarch and Queen Camilla, clearly making a good impression on Peter's relatives.\nHarriet continued making appearances with her beau, including at separate sporting events and a soiree thrown by Camilla's son, Tom Parker Bowles.\nPrevious relationships\nBefore meeting Harriet, Peter was married to Autumn Kelly, and the former couple share two daughters, Savannah and Isla. After marrying in 2008, Peter and Autumn confirmed their separation in February 2020, with their divorce settled in June 2021. It's understood that Autumn remained living in Gloucestershire, so that she and Peter can co-parent their daughters.\nHarriet is also a mother to daughter Georgia, and she previously addressed the issues of being a single mother. \"In the earlier years of my journey as a single mother to my daughter, resources were scarce, and the future was uncertain,\" she told Woman Alive.\n\"Yet, in the absence of material security, I discovered the strength and life that comes from true selfless love. A love that is able to be solely devoted to your child.\"\nHarriet's style file\nSince making her public debut with Peter, Harriet has proven she fits right in with the royal ladies. Often flying the flag for British labels such as Beulah London, ME+EM and Penelope Chilvers, all eyes will be on the bride-to-be in the run up to her nuptials.\nHELLO!'s Royal Correspondent Danielle Stacey says: \"Harriet's style is effortless but chic, from A-line summer frocks to printed tea dresses, she hasn't missed the mark and always dresses appropriately for the occasion.\n\"Some fashion watchers have even predicted that we're already starting to see the 'Harriet-effect,' with pieces she's coveted selling out fast.\n\"Thinking ahead to her wedding day, I'm certain she will choose a quintessentially British designer, perhaps someone up-and-coming and local to Gloucestershire.\""
