  "content": "SCARLET: WELCOME TO \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" A QUIET TRADE THIS AFTERNOON, THE S & P 500 STILL NEAR RECORD HIGHS, MARGINALLY LOWER OF CLOSURE -- OF COURSE, BUT JAY POWELL WILL BE SPEAKING FROM JACKSON HOLE AND THERE IS A WAIT UNTIL WE GET TO THAT POINT. INVESTORS ARE CURRENTLY WAITING FOR A MEETING BETWEEN TRUMP AND EUROPEAN AND U.K. LEADERS. YOU ARE SEEING A SLIGHT LIFT TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHERE CRUDE OIL HAS BEEN BOUNCING BETWEEN GAINS AND LOSSES AT $63 PER BARREL. WE HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS SET TO DISCUSS TAKING A 10% STAKE IN THE CHIPMAKER, IT -- INTEL. YOU CAN SEE A MOVE IN THOSE SHARES AFTER THEY GOT A BIT OF A LEG UP AND THEN PROMPTLY DROPPED AND I -- IS DOWN AGAIN, 2.5 PERCENT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONSIDERING CONVERTING SOME OR ALL OF INTEL'S GRANTS INTO EQUITY ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER. BLOOMBERG LEARNING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING BEING DISCUSSED. WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED IF THERE ARE FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS ON THIS FRONT. IN THE MEANTIME, A COUPLE OF OTHER INDIVIDUAL EQUITY MOVERS, LET'S BRING IN NORAH MULINDA. > > SHARES OF NOVO NORDISK ARE CHARGING HIGHER AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF GOOD RX. THE BEST NEWS HERE FOR A LOT OF INVESTORS IS THE FACT THAT THEY WILL BE CUTTING THE PRICES OF THEIR SIGNATURE OZEMPIC WEIGHT LOSS DRUG AND HALF, $499. THEY SAY IT'S UNRELATED TO THE GOVERNMENT PRESSURES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO A LOT OF THESE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AS WE SEE THIS PARTNERSHIP ARE SHARES HIGHER. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT TARO WOLF IN THE GREEN THIS MORNING, THE ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEAN BITCOIN MINING FACILITY OPERATOR SAID GOOGLE AGREED TO BOOST THEIR STAKE IN THE COMPANY TO 14% FROM THEIR 8% STAKE THAT THEY HAD AN SHARES ARE UP OVER 70% YEAR TO DATE. IT'S A DEFINITELY WELCOME ADDITION. LASTLY, TAKING A LOOK AT BRAVO, AND FOCUS TODAY BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS IN TALKS TO ACQUIRE DAY FOREST. THE DEAL COULD BE ANNOUNCED AS SOON AS THE COMING WEEKS, THEY WOULD BE TAKING A COMPANY PRIVATE. SHARES ARE DOWN ABOUT 7% YEAR TO DATE. MUCH TO KEEP AN EYE ON. SCARLET: KEEPING AN EYE ON WASHINGTON WHERE VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY IS KEEPING -- IS TAKING A MEETING TODAY WITH THE PRESIDENT. LAST YEAR URSULA VON DER LEYEN SPOKE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS. > > AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS BRUTAL INVASION, EUROPE HAS BEEN AT THE SIDE OF UKRAINE, UNITED, AND WE WILL SUPPORT YOU FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES. FOR A JUST AND LASTING PEACE. THIS PIECE MUST BE ACHIEVED THROUGH STRENGTH. SCARLET: JOINING US NOW FOR MORE IS ERIC MARTIN, WHO COVERS NATIONAL SECURITY ON THE NORTH LAWN. GOOD TO SPEAK WITH YOU, ERIC. GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA. WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN TRUMP AND PUT IN ON FRIDAY. -- TWITCH IN ON FRIDAY -- PUTIN ON FRIDAY. IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR. ERIC: POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEETINGS BETWEEN A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND LEADERS OF EUROPE SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR. WE ARE LOOKING AT AND ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT WILL BE THE SECURITY GUARANTEES, FOR ONE THING, MENTIONED BY STEVE WITKOFF YESTERDAY ON SOME OF THOSE SUNDAY SHOWS. SECURITY GUARANTEES FOR UKRAINE IF THERE IS A RESOLUTION AND AN AGREEMENT TO END THE WAR. IT WAS MENTIONED BY MR. WITKOFF, THE IDEA OF ARTICLE FIVE-LIKE GUARANTEES. IN THE NATO CONTEXT THAT CONSIDERS AN ATTACK ON ONE AS AN ATTACK ON ALL. VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID IT'S UNACCEPTABLE, OF COURSE, FOR UKRAINE TO BE A FULL MEMBER OF NATO. WE HAVE SEEN U.S. OFFICIALS SAY UKRAINE WILL NOT BE A MEMBER OF NATO. BUT THE IDEA THAT ORIGINALLY CAME FROM THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER ABOUT HAVING A NATO LIKE PROTECTION AND SECURITY GUARANTEE FOR UKRAINE WITHOUT FULL MEMBERSHIP AND WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE, THE U.S. INVOLVEMENT AS WELL. YESTERDAY SECRETARY RUBIO TALK ABOUT LOOKING AT MORE DETAILS BEING DISCUSSED DURING THE MEETINGS TODAY. THAT LANGUAGE LEAVES A LOT OF ROOM. BEYOND SOMETHING QUICK, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT TRUMP PRIORITIZES IN ANY KIND OF COMPROMISE? ONE OMINOUS THING WAS HIS REFERENCE LAST NIGHT TO THIS IDEA THAT UKRAINE WILL NOT BE TAKING BACK CRIMEA, WHICH I THINK A LOT OF ANALYSTS HAVE UNDERSTOOD, BUT PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS ABOUT HOW HE VIEWS THE IDEA OF LAND TRANSFER AND THE IDEA THAT UKRAINE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE SOME OF THE LANDS OCCUPIED BEFORE THE INVASION AND BEFORE THE 2014 INVASION OF THE DIFFERENT REGIONS. AND THIS IDEA THAT RUSSIA MIGHT BE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE ITS WAY TO PERMANENTLY CONTROLLING MORE LAND THAT THEY DON'T CONTROL FULLY, SOMETHING ZELINSKI HAS SAID IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, THAT THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE COULDN'T ACCEPT. YESTERDAY RUBIO TALK ABOUT THE IDEA THAT TO REACH A FINAL RESOLUTION HERE, YOU NEED EACH SIGNED TO GIVE SOMETHING AND EACH SIDE TO GET SOMETHING. LOOKING AHEAD AT WHAT THE DETAILS ARE OF THOSE POTENTIAL TRADE-OFFS. APPRECIATE IT, ERIC. THANK YOU FOR WALKING US THROUGH THOSE --APPRECIATE IT, ERIC -- APPRECIATE IT, ERIC. WE WANT TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION NOW WITH A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMICS. SHE JOINS US FROM NOT. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO SPEAK WITH US. YOU HEARD ERIC GIVE US THE CONTOURS OF WHAT IS LIKELY TO BE AMONG THE DISCUSSION POINTS TODAY BETWEEN EUROPEAN LEADERS, ZELINSKI, AND TRUMP. TRUMP AND THE WHITE HOUSE, KEEPING EXPECTATIONS LOW. MARCO RUBIO TOOK PART IN THAT SUMMIT WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AND SAID WE ARE STILL A LONG WAYS OFF FROM ANYTHING. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT SETS US UP FOR DISCUSSION TODAY? > > IT SETS US UP FOR KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. POSSIBLY A POSITIVE OUTCOME FROM THIS MEETING. EUROPEAN LEADERS AND ZELINSKI WANT TO AVOID THE SAME SITUATION, THE SAME FIREWORKS THAT WE SAW EARLIER THIS YEAR DURING THE FIRST MEETINGS. WE WANT TO GO QUIETLY, PEACEFUL WITH NEGOTIATIONS, FIRST AND FOREMOST. SECOND, UKRAINE AND MOST EUROPEAN LEADERS WANT TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT RUSSIAN DEMANDS. I'M SURE THAT WITH THESE DEMANDS ON THE TABLE, SANCTIONS RELIEF, FINANCIAL SANCTIONS AND PERHAPS RENEWAL BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES OF FLIGHTS, WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE ON THAT AS WELL. KATIE: WE WILL LOOK FOR THAT, BUT YOU DON'T SEE AN ANNOUNCEMENT OR A DECISION ON THAT IMMEDIATELY. I GUESS MY QUESTION HERE IS -- ARE THERE SPECIFIC REDLINES WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF? WHAT ARE THE REDLINES FOR UKRAINE OR FOR EUROPEAN LEADERS? > > THE FIRST ONE FOR UKRAINE IS THE SO-CALLED TERRITORY EXCHANGE , WHICH IS NOT REALLY AN EXCHANGE. UKRAINE GIVES UP TERRITORY IN EXCHANGE FOR NOT BEING ATTACKED. THAT'S A DIFFICULT ISSUE FOR UKRAINE. ANY AGREEMENT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH PARLIAMENT AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE REPRESENTING THOSE TERRITORIES AND PARLIAMENT. IT WILL BE A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE. OF COURSE THERE ARE POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE CONSTITUTION. TERRITORIAL ISSUES WILL BE A REDLINE FOR UKRAINIAN AUTHORITIES. FOR RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES, IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE REDLINES ARE. THEY SEEM TO BE SETTING THEIR OBJECTIVES SO FAR OUT, IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE THEY ARE NOT VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THE NEGOTIATIONS. SCARLET: A GOOD POINT. IT GIVES THEM PLENTY OF ROOM TO MANEUVER IF THEY NEED IT. MARCO RUBIO SAID THAT TODAY WOULD FOCUS ON SECURITY GUARANTEES FOR UKRAINE, INCLUDING WHAT THE U.S. WOULD CONTRIBUTE. WHAT'S THE MOST THE U.S. IS LIKELY TO OFFER AND WHAT'S THE LEASE THAT UKRAINE AND EUROPEANS WOULD BE LIKELY TO ACCEPT? > > THE GOLDEN MIDDLE WOULD BE EUROPEAN LET -- LEADERS NOT STANDING IN DEFENSE OF UKRAINE. THE TRANSFER WEAPONS ABILITY FOR THEM TO PURCHASE THE CRITICAL WEAPONS THE U.S. PRODUCES AND BEING ABLE TO SHIP THEM TO UKRAINE IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. THAT'S NECESSARY AND A REDLINE I'M SURE OF UKRAINE AND EUROPE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY CAN. ALSO, INTELLIGENCE SHARING. THAT'S AN INNOVATION THAT THE U.S. HAS TO CONTINUE. ON WHAT ELSE CAN BE PROVIDED, CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE MILITARY, THE WEAPONS, MORE AGGRESSIVE WEAPONS, I'M NOT HOLDING MY BREATH. I THINK THAT THIS MIDDLEGROUND OF WHERE WE ARE AND CONTINUING WITH IT, THAT WILL BE THE POSITIVE OUTCOME OF THE MEETING. SCARLET: WE ARE TAKING A LOOK AT THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ARRIVING AT THE WHITE HOUSE NOW, SHAKING HANDS WITH GIORGIA MELONI, I THINK. HARD TO SAY. EUROPEAN LEADERS CONTINUE TO ARRIVE FOR THE SUMMIT WITH TRUMP AND ZELINSKI. LET ME COME BACK TO YOU, ERIC MARTIN WAS TALKING TO US ABOUT THIS ARTICLE FIVE LANGUAGE THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP. WE KNOW THAT THE SPECIAL ENVOY SAID THAT THE TALKS GOT TO AN AGREEMENT THAT THE U.S. AND OTHER NATIONS COULD EFFECTIVELY OFFER ARTICLE FIVE TYPE LANGUAGE TO UKRAINE. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT KIND OF OFFER WITHOUT THE FORMAL ARCHITECTURE OF NATO MEMBERSHIP? > > I THINK THAT THIS OFFER IS MORE CONFUSING THAN SIGNIFICANT, PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ARCHITECTURE OR EXPLICIT DETAILS. IT'S EASY TO MAKE THIS KIND OF OFFER BUT IT ISN'T CLEAR HOW IT WILL BE EXECUTED. TROOPS ON THE GROUND? SOME SORT OF RESPONSE TO RUSSIAN AGGRESSION? MORE WEAPONS? WHAT KIND OF WEAPONS? AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THAT BE ACCEPTABLE FOR THE RUSSIAN SIDE? THEY'VE BEEN VERY FORCEFUL SAYING THAT THIS WAS MADE TO PROVOKE RUSSIAN AGGRESSION ON UKRAINE. SCARLET: GOOD STUFF. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND GIVING US A LOT TO THINK ABOUT AS THESE MEETINGS GET UNDERWAY. COMING TO US FROM THE PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMICS AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS SAID TO BE DISCUSSING TAKING A 10% STAKE IN INTEL. WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THAT, WHEN WE RETURN. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. SCARLET: WE HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS THAT WE TOLD YOU ABOUT AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR, THE WHITE HOUSE IS IN DISCUSSIONS TO TAKE A 10% STAKE IN THE CHIPMAKER, INTEL. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONSIDERING CONVERTING SOME OR ALL OF THOSE GRANTS FROM THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT INTO EQUITY ACCORDING TO THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER. RYAN GOULD ORIGINALLY REPORTED ON THE STORY. WHY WOULD THE WHITE HOUSE WANT TO TAKE A 10% STAKE? > > I THINK IT'S AS MUCH ABOUT ENSURING THE INTEL LONGEVITY IS ANYTHING ELSE. IT'S AN EVOLVING SITUATION AND WE SHOULD CAUTION THAT THESE PLANS ARE IN FLUX AND FLUID. INTEL HAS NOT COMMENTED ON THEM. WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERING TAKING A 10% STAKE IN INTEL. THEIR MARKET CAP SHARES ARE MOVING LOWER ON THESE HEADLINES AND YOU ARE LOOKING AT AROUND A 10.5, 10 BILLION DOLLARS STAKE, MAKING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THEIR SINGLE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER, KIND OF A REPLICATION THAT WE SAW -- OR SOMETHING FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO ON A RARE EARTHS COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT WOULD BE GETTING AN INVESTMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. SCARLET: THAT'S A PART OF A BIGGER PICTURE STRATEGY CONTEXT, PERHAPS. TALKING ABOUT THE SHARE PRICE, YOU MENTIONED THAT THE STOCK IS LOWER. WHEN THE HEADLINE CROSSED THERE WAS A BUMP UPWARDS IN HEADLINE SHARES. THEY HAVE GIVEN UP THAT AND ARE DEEP INTO LOSSES. I KNOW WE DON'T KNOW THE REASON THAT THE SHARES ARE DOWN, BUT WHAT COULD BE AN INTERPRETATION FOR WHY SHAREHOLDERS DON'T LIKE THE > > NEWS? > > IF YOU ARE A SHAREHOLDER YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES FACING INTEL. WHAT IT DOES ON THE ONE HAND IS GIVE CONFIDENCE TO INTEL AND SHAREHOLDERS IN TERMS OF HAVING THE MOST CREDIT WORTHY INSTITUTION IN THE WORLD BACKING YOU, BUT ON THE FACE OF IT WHAT IT DOESN'T DO IS SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT INTEL HAS WITH ITS PRODUCT. INTEL HAS BEEN TRYING TO MANUFACTURE CHIPS AT SCALE FOR YEARS. THEIR OHIO PLANT, LONG DELAYED, HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION FOR MANY YEARS. PAT GELSON SAW IT AS KEY TO PUTTING INTEL BACK ON THE MAP WHEN IT CAME TO MANUFACTURING SEMICONDUCTORS. IT'S BEEN DELAYED FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS. INTEL DOES NOT YET MAKE SEMI CONDUCTORS FOR ANYONE ELSE BUT THEMSELVES. YOU ARE NOT REALLY IN THE HOLE. YOU ARE STILL IN THE HOLE IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE AND THIS PLANT IS HEAVILY LOSSMAKING. SCARLET: GOOD STUFF, RYAN. THANK YOU. WE HAVE ALMOST ALL THE EUROPEAN LEADERS PRESENT AS THEY GET READY TO MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT. WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE FINNISH PRESIDENT TO JOIN THE DELEGATION. LET'S MOVE ON TO ANOTHER STOCK WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON OUT OF EUROPE, NOVO NORDISK, RISING ADRS TODAY AFTER THE DRUGMAKER CUT THE CASH PRICE OF OZEMPIC BY HALF IN THE U.S., THEY ARE WORKING WITH GOOD RX TO MAKE THE PRICE WIDELY AVAILABLE AS COMPETITION INTENSIFIES AND SCRUTINY OF U.S. PRICING MOUNTS. EARLIER TODAY WENDI BARNES SPOKE WITH US ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP. TAKE A LISTEN. > > WE DON'T FULFILL OR DISPENSE PRESCRIPTIONS. WE PARTNER WITH PHARMACIES SUCH THAT THE CONSUMER CAN REALLY CHOOSE WHATEVER PHARMACY IT IS THEY PREFER TO WORK WITH. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PROGRAM TO THEIR OWN DIRECT PROGRAM THAT WE ALSO SUPPORT IN THE MARKETPLACE. SCARLET: FOR MORE, LET'S BRING OUR HEALTH REPORTER. MADISON, TALKING ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TAKING A 10% STAKE IN INTEL. TO WHAT EXTENT IS THIS ADJUSTMENT COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE THE DRUGMAKERS HAVE BEEN BEING PUSHED TO LOWER PRICES IN THE U.S.? MADISON: GOOD QUESTION. THIS TIMING IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY LOWERED THE PRICE OF THEIR OBESITY DRUG IN MARCH TO THE $500 PER MONTH PRICE AND HAVE CONTINUED OFFERING VARIOUS DISCOUNTS WITH PARTNERS. NOW, AS WE ARE SEEING PRESSURE MOUNT FROM TRUMP ON THESE DRUG COMPANIES AND THE FACT THAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT DIRECT TO CONSUMER AS A POSSIBLE AVENUE, IT IS INTERESTING THAT OZEMPIC, PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR AND WELL-KNOWN NAME OF ANY DRUG RIGHT NOW, WOULD GET A PRICE CUT LIKE THIS AT THIS TIME. THEY'VE SAID THIS PRICE CUT IS SEPARATE, DIFFERENT, INDEPENDENT FROM THEIR DISCUSSIONS WITH CMS AND IRA, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE TIMING OF THIS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THIS IS SO TOP OF MIND FOR MANY COMPANIES. SCARLET: YOU CAN'T HELP BUT MADE THE LINK. OZEMPIC IT, IT'S ACTUALLY A DIABETES SHOT, BUT SO MANY KNOW IT AS WEIGHT LOSS. IT IS WIDELY COVERED BY INSURANCE. HOW DOES THAT PLAY INTO THIS PRICING DECISION? MADISON: THERE'S A VERY LARGE CASH MARKET FOR THE WEIGHT LOSS BECAUSE IT ISN'T SUPER WIDELY COVERED BY INSURANCE. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO DIABETES, USUALLY PEOPLE WILL HAVE COVERAGE FOR IT. THERE IS LESS OF AN INCENTIVE OR REASON FOR THEM TO BRING A CASH PRICE TO MARKET, WHICH IS WHY IT SPEAKS TO POTENTIALLY THIS COMING FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THE FORM OF PRESSURE. THEY ARE ALSO CONTENDING WITH THE RISE OF COPYCAT WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS, INTENSIFYING COMPETITION WITH ELI LILLY. THIS COULD BE A MOVE TO JUST SORT OF MAKE THEIR DRUGS MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE WHO WANTS THEM AS THIS PRESSURE INTENSIFIES AND AS THEY NEED TO CLAWBACK MARKET SHARE. SCARLET: MADISON: SCARLET: KENT -- FANTASTIC CONTEXT THERE, THANK YOU. COMING UP, 10,000 AIR CANADA FLIGHT ATTENDANTS WALKED OFF THE JOB ON SATURDAY, GROUNDING THE AIRLINE AND DISRUPTING TRAVEL FOR 130,000 PASSENGERS PER DAY. WHAT'S NEXT? WE BRING THAT TO YOU. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a SCARLET: AIR CANADA PULLED HER FINANCIAL GUIDANCE AFTER 10,000 FLIGHT ATTENDANTS WALKED OFF THE JOB SEEKING HIGHER PAY AND COMPENSATION. LET'S BRING IN OUR VANCOUVER BUREAU CHIEF, WHO HAS BEEN HELPING TO COVER THE STORY. AIR CANADA'S UNION SAYS THEY REMAIN COMMITTED TO FINDING SOME KIND OF DEAL. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION SAID THEY ARE WILLING TO GO TO JAIL FOR THE AIR CANADA STRIKE. THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT IS RESOLVED THIS WEEK ANY TIME SOON, DOES IT? > > IT'S COMPLICATED, THE LEGAL ACTION IS MOVING VERY FAST. AS YOU SAY, THE UNION IS DIGGING HIS HEELS. THEY ARE STILL STRIKING DESPITE IT BEING ORDERED UNLAWFUL BY THE LABOR BOARD. THAT MEANS IT BECOMES A TEST OF HOW THE LABOR BOARD, THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE AIRLINE POSSIBLY ENFORCE IT. IT COULD RESULT IN FINES AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW BUT JAIL TIME FOR LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY THE PROFESSORS WE HAVE INTERVIEWED FOR ENCOURAGING THE STRIKE. SO, YES, THE PLANES AREN'T MOVING. THE CURRENT SCHEDULE IS THAT THEY SHOULD RESUME SLEPT -- FLIGHTS THIS EVENING BUT IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT IT GETS PUSHED ANOTHER DAY. A ROLLING UPDATE RATHER THAN A FIXED UPDATE. SCARLET: I LIKE HOW YOU PUT THAT AS WE ROLLED THROUGH THE HEADLINES. WHAT'S THE ROLE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PLAYING AS THEY MONITOR THESE CONVERSATIONS OR LACK THEREOF. > > IT COMES DOWN TO THE POWER THEY USED IN THE LABOR CODE. IT HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES BUT WAS BASICALLY NEVER USED UNTIL VERY RECENTLY. IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS IS HAS BEEN USED HALF A DOZEN TIMES TO PREVENT OR SHUTDOWN STRIKES QUICKLY. IT DIRECTS THE INDEPENDENT LABOR BOARD TO SECURE AN INDUSTRIAL PEACE AND ORDER WORKERS BACK TO WORK. SINCE IT HAS BEEN USED RECENTLY IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN COURT AND IT IS WORKING ITS WAY UP THE COURT. IT CAN BE A SLOW PROCESS TO FIND OUT THE ULTIMATE ANSWER BUT THE UNION SAYS IT'S A TRAP DOOR WHERE COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH, THEY JUST HAVE TO LET THINGS SPIRAL AND OPERATIONS STOP WHEN THE GOVERNMENT FLINCHES AND OBVIOUSLY BUSINESSES NEED STABILITY. SO DO INVESTMENTS AS WELL. SOMEONE USED IT VERY QUICKLY, 12 HOURS WITHIN THE TIME OF STRIKING. > > THOMAS, THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH WITH THE LATEST ON THAT AIR CANADA STRIKE. SHARES ARE DOWN 1.4% FOR THE STEEPEST DECLINE SO FAR THIS MONTH. I'M SCARLET FU, THAT DOES IT FOR BLOOMBERG MARKETS. THE NASDAQ 100 IS LOSING ONE QUARTER OF 1%. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.",
