      "feedback": "The draft is a micro‑company earnings recap that does **not** satisfy the Argos criteria:\n\n- **No canonical handle**: The only handle is the CRWD share price, which is not among the approved indices, rates, FX, commodities, or credit/vol handles.  \n- **No macro catalyst**: The narrative focuses on product launches and earnings guidance, lacking a clear, dated macro catalyst that drives a transmission path to a liquid handle.  \n- **Outside the mandated pillar**: The analysis is about a single U.S. tech firm, not a macro pillar (growth, inflation, rates, FX, commodities, credit, etc.).  \n\n**Actionable edit**:  \n1. **Reject** the current topic.  \n2. Replace it with a macro‑focused theme that maps to at least one canonical handle (e.g., “US tech sector earnings cycle → spx”, “cybersecurity spending → spx/ndx”, or “Fed policy impact on tech valuations → ust10y → spx”).  \n3. Ensure the new topic includes a dated catalyst window (e.g., Fed policy meeting, Q2 earnings season) and a clear causal chain to the chosen handle.",
