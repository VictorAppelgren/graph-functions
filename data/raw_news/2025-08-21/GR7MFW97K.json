  "content": "When floodwaters rushed through a girl\u2019s summer camp nestled in the Texas Hill Country, Michael McCown\u2019s 8-year-old daughter was among 27 campers and counselors swept to their deaths.\n\nOn Wednesday, McCown joined other Camp Mystic parents, some wearing buttons memorializing \u201cHeaven\u2019s 27,\u201d in demanding that Texas lawmakers pass a bill that would boost camp safety, including generally keeping cabins out of flood plains, instituting new requirements for emergency plans and mandating weather radios.\n\n\u201cIt will hurt my family forever that, for reasons I still do not know, these protections were not in place nor thought out thoroughly for my daughter and the rest of the girls here,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease pass this bill, protect our kids and do not let their deaths be in vain.\u201d\n\nMcCown\u2019s middle child, Linnie, was sandwiched between two brothers. She was sometimes a pest to her 11-year-old brother. But to the youngest, just 3, she was mother figure, making him cereal on weekends so her parents could catch a few minutes of sleep.\n\n\u201cTo everyone else she was a joy,\u201d her father told lawmakers. \u201cShe hugged her teachers, was a friend to everybody and spread an infectious giggle everywhere she went.\u201d\n\nThen came the floods.\n\nPHOTOS: Parents of kids swept away in Texas floods beg lawmakers to protect future campers\n\nJust before daybreak on the Fourth of July, destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe River, washing away homes and vehicles. All told, at least 136 people died, raising questions about how things went so terribly wrong.\n\nCounty leaders were asleep or out of town. The head of Camp Mystic had been tracking the weather beforehand, but it\u2019s now unclear whether he saw an urgent warning from the National Weather Service that had triggered an emergency alert to phones in the area, a spokesperson for camp\u2019s operators said in the immediate aftermath.\n\nSome of the camp\u2019s buildings - which flooded - were in what the Federal Emergency Management Agency considered a 100-year flood plain. But in response to an appeal, FEMA in 2013 amended the county\u2019s flood map to remove 15 of the camp\u2019s buildings from the hazard area.\n\nUpon learning of the flooding, McCown rushed to the town of Kerrville to pick up Linnie, receiving an email en route that if parents hadn\u2019t been personally contacted, then their daughters are accounted for.\n\n\u201cI felt a wave of relief, which was quickly shattered about 30 minutes later when my wife called incredibly distraught to say that Linnie is missing,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHe joined the search downstream from the camp and found the body of a deceased girl. He also made two trips to a funeral home to identify bodies. One was not Linnie; the other, he believed, was. He later provided authorities with a DNA swab.\n\n\u201cHow,\u201d he asked, \u201ccould these girls vanish into the night without anyone having eyes on them while cabins literally just 20 yards away had no casualties? So what went wrong?\u201d\n\nCici Williams Steward said assurances that her daughter, Cile Steward, would be safe were betrayed and protocols that should have been in place were ignored. Today, the body of the 8-year-old \u201cremains somewhere in the devastation of the Guadalupe River,\u201d the only Camp Mystic camper still missing.\n\n\u201cWe are suspended in endless anguish, unable to move forward, unable to find peace,\u201d a tearful Steward said. \u201cWe ask you, please pass SB1 so no parent sends their child to camp believing they are safe only to face this nightmare. And just as urgently, please do not stop the search for Cile Steward. Please do not give up on our girl.\u201d\n\nTexas State Sen. Charles Perry described the proposed legislation as a \u201clegacy to the loss\u201d and an answer to what has been learned during hours of public testimony. He said it\u2019s dubbed the \u201cHeaven\u2019s 27 Camp Safety Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only appropriate,\u201d Perry said, \u201cto memorialize the 27 little girls that lost their lives at Camp Mystic in this way.\u201d",
