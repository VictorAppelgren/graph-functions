  "title": "Here's What It Means When You See A Biker Point Their Thumb At Their Helmet",
  "description": "When a biker points their thumb at their helmet, it typically signals a request for a rest stop, part of common motorcycle group riding hand signals.",
  "content": "Motorcycle riders on the open highway often face limitations in traditional communication methods. Other motorists may not be able to see their faces under their helmets, and if many riders are riding in a group without some means of audible communication like radios, it's too loud to just talk. This, among other reasons, is why biker culture comes with an entire dictionary of hand signs and signals to communicate intent with other bikers on the road, such as pointing up two fingers or sticking their leg out. Whether you're a burgeoning road warrior yourself or are just curious about what all the wild gesticulating means, knowing the meaning behind common motorcycle hand signals can teach you a lot about biker culture.\n\nTo cite a specific example, if you've ever seen a group of bikers out on the road, you may have noticed one of them, probably the leader of the pack, pointing their thumb up at their helmet. This is likely followed by the group pulling off at a highway exit. While you may expect that little interaction to simply mean \"let's get off the highway,\" that signal is meant to communicate a specific goal. That goal is the need for a rest stop, whether to get a snack, use the facilities, or just for everyone to rest their arms and legs.",

      "text": "What Does It Mean When A Biker Sticks Their Leg Out?\nThe biker community is full of non-vocal communication, like pointing at their mouth with their thumb to indicate they want a refreshment stop and pointing two fingers down signifies a hello. These signals are universally understood by bikers and used to say important things to one another while on the road, keeping them organized and safe. But not all biker signals are done with hands. You may have noticed some motorcycle riders putting their leg out to the side. This is yet another way that bikers talk to one another without needing to hear a single word.\nThere are a few possible meanings behind a biker putting their foot out depending on where you are in the world, but the overall consensus is that it's a quick way to positively acknowledge other drivers. Bikers in Europe and Australia have expressed that it's usually a way to thank someone in a car for letting them pass. One Australian biker noted on a biker forum that it's rare for a car to let a biker pass in some countries so they will stick their foot out to say \"thanks\" when a car gives them space to pass. In response, American bikers said they wave with their hands instead. This is different from MotoGP riders, who stick out their leg while taking corners for more wind resistance.\nWhat is the proper etiquette for letting a biker pass?\nCar drivers and motorcycle riders can sometimes seem like they're in completely different worlds even if they're on the same highway. It can be tough to know how to communicate between the two especially when trying to pass in a car or let a biker pass. There are some universal etiquette and safety rules, however, for these situations.\nIf you are in a car and want to let a motorcycle rider pass, it's recommended that you make room for the biker on either side of the lane, slow down, and make a motion out of the window to indicate you're letting them pass. In states where lane splitting is legal, it can be illegal to block a motorcyclist that wants to pass. If you are in a car and want to pass a motorcyclist \u2014 or group of bikers \u2014 it's polite to make a motion that you want to pass and then wait for the bikers to move out of the way when they feel they're in a spot that's safe to do so."

      "text": "Common Motorcycle Hand Signals Every Rider Should Know\nCommon hand signals and how to legally use them are among the most important tips every motorcycle rider should know. State driving laws contain provisions for hand signals that apply not only to motorcycle riders, but other drivers as well. It's important for everyone on the road to understand proper hand signals used by drivers without tail lights or turn signals. Section 42-4-609 of Colorado's State Statue, for example, makes provisions for three basic hand signals: left turn, right turn, and slowing or stopping. The law requires hand signals to extend from the left side of the vehicle and makes violation a punishable offense.\nTo properly execute a hand signal indicating an impending left turn, simply extend your left arm and hand horizontally. The hand signal for making a right turn calls for the left hand and arm to extend upward, typically with the arm bent 90-degrees at the elbow. The timing of these signals is much the same as any other turn signal, except having both hands on the bars are preferred for executing the turn, so there's no way to signal while turning.\nThe hand signal for slowing or stopping is similar to a right turn, except the hand and forearm are extended downward. Emergency stops are tricky, as using one hand to signal and one on the bars limits the amount of control the rider has over the motorcycle. This is one of many reasons taking a motorcycle safety course is a good idea.\nBesides basic hand signals, what other hand signals should motorcycle riders know?\nMotorcycle rider-focused organizations like Harley-Davidson Insurance and The Twisted Road Blog add nuances to basic hand signals and recommend more signals that allow riders to relay important information. For example, both groups add facing the palm of the left hand down to the basic left turn signal, making a fist for right turns, and the palm facing rearward for stopping.\nGroups of motorcyclists also use several hand signals to communicate with one another. If you're new to a group or have someone new join your group for the first time, it's a good idea to review advanced hand signals as a group beforehand. The leader of the group will often raise the left arm with palm facing forward, telling the group to follow them. If a group leader pulls alongside you, points to your bike and swings their arm forward, you should follow them or take the position of group leader.\nRoad hazards are indicated by pointing with the left hand or right leg depending on which side of the road it's on. Group leaders may indicate the need for single or double-file formation by extending one or two fingers from a raised left hand, riders in the group should relay the signal to those behind them. If you see fellow riders tapping the tops of their heads, use caution as there could be an accident or law enforcement ahead."

      "text": "What Does It Mean When A Biker Points Two Fingers Up?\nBike riding is one of the best modes of transportation on the road. The sleek design of a bike gives you an advantage in high-traffic areas, as you can easily maneuver between cars and weave through traffic. However, things can go wrong quickly if you don't use proper signals and gestures while riding a motorcycle.\nWhether you have a budget-friendly motorcycle or an expensive bike like the Suzuki Hayabusa, you'll find only three built-in signals\u2014right, left, and hazard. You'll primarily use the turn signals when making a turn and the hazard lights when you've pulled over due to a problem with your bike.\nIn addition to these standard indicators, bikers \u2014 especially those riding in groups \u2014 often use hand signals on the road. For example, you may see a rider extending their left hand straight out with the palm facing down. This gesture signals fellow riders to slow down, possibly because the road ahead is unclear or in poor condition.\nSimilarly, bikers use many other hand gestures while riding, one of which is pointing two fingers up. No, it's definitely not a victory gesture. Instead, it's called \"double file\" in biker terms, and riders use it to signal fellow bikers to change their formation on the road.\nWhy do bikers point two fingers up?\nUsing hand gestures is one of the best ways for bikers to stay in touch with their riding group and ensure that everyone follows the same formation. There are two main hand gestures that bikers use (with index and middle fingers) while riding.\nThe first is the \"double file\" gesture, where a rider raises two fingers up. This signal is typically given by the lead rider in a group to instruct others to ride side by side in a double file formation. For example, if a group of four riders is on the road, once the double file gesture is shown, two riders will ride side by side, with the other two riding side by side behind them. The lead biker usually gives this signal when the road ahead is wide enough to accommodate the formation without blocking traffic for other vehicles.\nAnother common gesture is bikers pointing two fingers down \u2013 a simple gesture of acknowledgment and solidarity. Riders use this signal to recognize and greet fellow motorcyclists on the road.\nSimilar to the double file gesture, there is also a \"single file\" gesture, where the lead rider raises only their index finger. This gesture signals the group to switch to a single-line formation. The lead biker typically uses this signal when the road ahead is too narrow for a double file formation, making it difficult for vehicles to overtake."
