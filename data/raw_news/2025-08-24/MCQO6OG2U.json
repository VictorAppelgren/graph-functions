  "description": "Wilson wound up curating a mountain of evidence against himself, including sick photographs and videos of himself committing sex acts on his female students, often as young as 6 or 7 years old.",
  "content": "A disgraced California elementary school teacher was sentenced to more than two centuries in prison last Friday after authorities unravelled the decades-long sexual abuse he committed against many of his own students.\n\nKim Kenneth Wilson, 64, served as the head of the audio-visual club at Del Paso Heights Elementary School for 23 years before he was axed when the stomach-turning abuse was revealed.\n\nWilson wound up curating a mountain of evidence against himself, including sick photographs and videos he captured of himself committing sex acts on his female students, often as young as 6 or 7 years old.\n\nThanks to his position as AV club head, he was flush with resources \u2014 including a soundproof broadcasting room where he would assault his victims, according to the Sacramento County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nAuthorities also learned that the teacher abused more children at his home during private events. It\u2019s unclear if these additional victims were related to the school.\n\nWhile searching Wilson\u2019s home in 2023, detectives with the Sacramento Police Department uncovered heaps of child-sized sex toys alongside VHS and DVDs with videos of the vile teacher sexually assaulting the children, according to the DA\u2019s office.\n\nThe collection spanned over multiple years with a variety of different victims, all listed between the ages of 6 and 12 years old.\n\nThe creep pleaded guilty in February to several counts of child sexual abuse in connection with the videos.\n\nHe originally faced a staggering 36 counts in connection with lewd and lascivious acts on children under 14. Some charges, though, were dismissed in order to spare the victims from having to testify in court.\n\nStill, Wilson was slapped with the doomsday sentence that, in nearly any other state, would likely guarantee his demise behind bars.\n\nBut because of Wilson\u2019s advanced age, he will be eligible for release depending on the outcome of an Elder Parole hearing once he has served 20 years of his sentence. By that point, Wilson will be in his mid-80s.\n\nFor now, he\u2019s being held at the Rio Consumnes Correctional Center in Elk Grove, a medium-security facility where he\u2019ll remain until transfer to a state prison.\n\nMany of Wilson\u2019s victims are still fighting for justice.\n\nThe Twin Rivers Unified School District only just reached a $6 million lawsuit settlement in a civil case alleging that it failed to properly supervise Wilson and permitted his gross misconduct to go unchecked for more than two decades, The Sacramento Bee reported.\n\nAnother family is still seeking damages from Wilson and the district through a separate civil case filed more than two years ago that is still proceeding in court.",

      "text": "Cracker Barrel board member under fire for DEI background after restaurant ditches traditional logo: \u2018What qualified him?\u2019\nOne member of Cracker Barrel\u2019s board of directors is catching heat over his DEI-heavy background following negative reaction to the company\u2019s new logo and redesigned interior and revelations about its embrace of far-Left values.\nGilbert Davila, 61, joined the restaurant chain\u2019s board in July 2020 and is also among its top individual shareholders. Conservative activist Robby Starbuck called out Davila in a video criticizing the company\u2019s leadership, calling the recent changes the culmination of a years-long campaign to cater to the far Left and abandon the values of its middle-America customer base.\n\u201cWhat qualified him for this board seat?\u201d Starbuck asks in the video. \u201cWell, you see, he\u2019s owned a DEI consulting and strategy firm for 15 years that focuses on pushing DEI and DEI advertising.\u201d\nStarbuck was referring to DMI Consulting, a firm where Davila has served as president and CEO since 2010. Davila\u2019s biography page on Cracker Barrel\u2019s website describes the firm as \u201ca leading multicultural marketing, diversity & inclusion and strategy firm in the United States.\u201d\nFOX Business reached out to Cracker Barrel and Davila\u2019s company for comment but did not hear back at the time of publication.\nConsumers have criticized Cracker Barrel after it unveiled a new logo that replaced the image of a man leaning on a barrel with just the restaurant\u2019s name in black text over a yellow barrel-shaped backdrop. The chain also redesigned the interior of its restaurants, ditching the kitschy American aesthetic and replacing it with a slick modernist motif.\nBut Starbuck said those cosmetic changes are just part of a lurch away from American values. In his 15-minute video, he notes the company has been active in LGBTQ pride events, and aggressively employed diversity, equity and inclusion policies in hiring.\nDavila\u2019s LinkedIn page states that he \u201cis widely recognized\u2026 for his multicultural market knowledge and his proven track record on how to best embed a multicultural perspective into a corporation\u2019s entire operation.\u201d\n\u201cPeople like him are behind the woke advertising push that we\u2019ve seen in recent years,\u201d Starbuck said of Davila in the video. \u201cAnd he was also one of the people responsible for DEI at Disney.\u201d\nPrior to his work at DMI, Davila worked at The Walt Disney Company, where he served as the vice president of global diversity and multicultural market development from 2003 to 2010.\nDavila earlier held the role of vice president of multicultural management for Sears & Roebuck Company and was a marketing director for Coca-Cola USA.\nDavila\u2019s biography page also notes that he is a member of the Association of National Advertisers, co-founding and serving as a director of the group\u2019s Alliance for Inclusive and Multicultural Marketing.\nStarbuck said he believes the controversy around Cracker Barrel\u2019s logo change is about more than the removal of a man in his chair leaning on a barrel.\n\u201cThe American people are sick of having our culture and heritage stripped from us,\u201d Starbuck told Fox News Digital last week."

      "text": "DATE: August 22, 2025\nCASE: Kim Kenneth Wilson (Case #23FE000906)\nPROSECUTOR: Deputy District Attorney Brandon Jack, Special Assault & Child Abuse Unit\nThe Honorable Satnam Rattu sentenced Kim Kenneth Wilson to 215 years to life in prison. On February 25, 2025, Wilson pled to nine counts of committing lewd acts upon a child. Wilson also admitted to multiple allegations of multiple victims as well as substantial sexual conduct and aggravating factors of vulnerable victim and position of trust.\nKim Wilson was a longtime teacher at Del Paso Heights Elementary School. He also established a media/broadcasting club for students, which had its own designated room assigned to the club. Throughout his tenure, Wilson took female students to the private broadcasting room alone. While in the room, he committed sex acts on the students, often photographing or recording the sex acts. While most of the sexual assaults occurred in the school broadcasting room, some of the victims were also assaulted at Wilson\u2019s home during events he hosted. Upon learning about the sexual assaults, Sacramento police detectives searched Wilson\u2019s home. Officers located a number of child sized sex toys, including child sized artificial genitalia and a child sized torso with artificial genitalia. Additionally, detectives located a substantial amount of VHS tapes, DVDs and other digital storage devices containing videos depicting Wilson sexually assaulting his students. The videos depicted conduct spanning multiple years with numerous students. The recorded content also showed Wilson forcing students to look into the camera while saying and depicting sexual acts.\nUnder current California law, Wilson (age 64) will become eligible for release at an Elder Parole hearing once he only serves 20 years of his 215 years to life sentence. With his in-custody credits, that will be in approximately 17 years.\nAdditional material on Elder Parole can be found here:\nElderly Parole Fact Sheet .docx (ca.gov)\nView Document \u2013 California Code of Regulations (westlaw.com)\nSection 3055 \u2013 Elderly Parole Program, Cal.

      "text": "My small-town beer buddy vented about his creepy teaching assistant all semester \u2014 it turned out to be Bryan Kohberger\nJohn Snyder is a kindly older man who lives in my small town. He\u2019s what you\u2019d consider a normal person \u2014 a married homeowner who teaches at the local university.\nHe\u2019d been a public defender for almost 30 years when he took the opportunity to teach students about the legal system instead of defend them in it, feeling he was nearing burnout in a demanding profession.\nI\u2019ve come to know John pretty well over the years, not just because we live in the same town \u2014 my wife, Alexis, is his favorite bartender, and he likes going out for dinner with his wife or having a beer after work as much as the next guy.\nBut there was a marked theme to John\u2019s happy-hour conversation in fall 2022: His teaching assistant in Washington State University\u2019s Criminal Justice and Criminology Department was \u201can a\u2013hole\u201d who was driving him crazy.\nNormal after-work grumbling, one might think, even if in a high quantity. Then bucolic life in our peaceful region was interrupted in November 2022 when four University of Idaho students were brutally murdered just 20 minutes away.\nAfter the new year, John came into the bar carrying a newspaper and looking bad enough that my wife said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You look like shit.\u201d\nJohn held up the paper and confirmed what we suspected after the arrest: His teaching assistant was Bryan Kohberger.\nJohn Snyder has avoided the media since Kohberger\u2019s arrest, but due to our friendship he agreed to meet me at the Palouse Caboose Bar & Grill, where my wife is a bartender, for some pitchers of beer and his first, and probably only, in-depth interview about supervising Bryan Kohberger.\nJohn graduated from the University of Idaho Law School in 1988 and began working as a public defender, his specialization throughout his legal career, saying, \u201cCriminals are more honest and easier to work with than people going through a divorce.\u201d\nHe was also attracted to the field by his sense of justice and desire to see people who may have disadvantages within society treated fairly by the legal system.\nAnd something of a troublemaker himself \u2014 his skill at pool paid his bar tabs all through law school \u2014 he could imagine being caught making some of the same mistakes as his clients.\nHe occasionally dealt with homicides or other serious crimes, but in a college town it\u2019s mostly young people screwing up.\nJohn doesn\u2019t feel this career has given him any greater ability to sense evil than the average person.\nAs a professor, John had a high volume of students and couldn\u2019t get to know many of them well. Teaching assistants are different, and in normal circumstances one works with them extensively.\nIt used to be that professors chose preferred potential TAs from a list, but for reasons he never discovered, the school abandoned this system and randomized the process, which is how he was assigned Kohberger.\nWhen the graduate student came to introduce himself early in summer 2022, John didn\u2019t think much of him: \u201cHe was a little odd, but a lot of people in academia are odd.\u201d\nDespite the TA-assignment system being designed to prevent this exact problem, Kohberger had a scheduling conflict and thus limited attendance in class, though he also often didn\u2019t show up when available.\nThe infrequency of his class appearances didn\u2019t stop one female student from emailing a friend near the semester\u2019s start, \u201cMy class\u2019s TA looks like a murderer.\u201d\nJohn says he tries to look at TAs\u2019 individual attributes and put them to work where they will be the most useful while training them on their weaker points.\nIn this instance, however, \u201cBryan quickly disabused me of the idea that I would get a sufficient amount of work out of him, and I quickly figured out he was a bit of a douche. And within a few weeks I realized this was going to be an exceptionally long semester.\u201d\nDespite Kohberger missing class, the prof saw him plenty.\nHere\u2019s the latest coverage on Bryan Kohberger:\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s classmates made 13 formal complaints about the killer for \u2018being a d\u2013k,\u2019 making offensive comments: report\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s creepy remark on night of Idaho murders revealed by surviving roommate\n- Eerie leaked videos of Bryan Kohberger with red hands inside cell being probed by Idaho prison\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s phone records unveil similarities to Norman Bates: \u2018Just super eerie\u2019\n\u201cHe rapidly developed the habit of coming in at the end of the day, when I clearly wanted to go home,\u201d he says. \u201cHe would start talking about inane, stupid and immature things. . . . I quickly realized this was a technique where he felt like he was in control as long as he was wasting my time.\u201d\nKohberger once tried to tell John how he was going to get out of a parking ticket, even managing to get him to examine the \u201cscene.\u201d It turned out the TA had parked next to a yellow curb in a lot where he didn\u2019t have a permit anyway.\nAdmonitions that in his experience as a defense attorney, people who believe they know the law better than the courts are always wrong fell on deaf ears.\nJohn says over time Kohberger \u201cwould follow me down the hall yapping, and I started calling it his \u2018terrier routine.\u2019\u201d\nWhen John\u2019s wife was waiting for him in the car once, she saw Kohberger following him and recoiled nearly to the other side, a reaction he\u2019d never seen from her in many years of marriage.\nSnyder had grown to hate Kohberger over the course of the semester but never thought he was dangerous \u2014 he actually considered him a wimp.\nHe learned of Kohberger\u2019s arrest along with everyone else. He was in his office Dec. 30 in a nearly empty building when the custodian told him the police had the basement sealed off.\nThey ended up walking to a picture board of department members, and the custodian started pointing at photos speculating whose office the police might be searching.\nWhen the custodian got to Kohberger, it hit him: His teaching assistant was the murderer.\nThen his phone rang; his brother-in-law told him Kohberger had been arrested. That call was interrupted by his son calling, which was interrupted by the Moscow, Idaho, police calling to set up an immediate interview; he drove to Moscow instead of waiting around for them to show up.\nFrom the police he learned Kohberger had a list of women\u2019s names of unknown purpose \u2014 though surely not anything good \u2014 and one of them was a woman he knew from the department. But overall he wasn\u2019t able to greatly help them besides describing Kohberger\u2019s character.\nHaving worked with a mass murderer was a system shock for John, even if he always disliked the guy.\nThe university\u2019s standard trauma-assistance programs proved unhelpful; the support \u201chotline\u201d he called listed every imaginable identity group besides his own \u2014 old white men \u2014 and then said it could set an appointment in two weeks.\nBut he says the stream of graduate students and undergrads coming into his office to offer support \u201cwas one of the coolest things I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d\nThe department chair also transferred his own excellent teaching assistant to John for the next semester to ease his workload \u2014 and so there would be no more surprises.\nJohn says the reality of the crime isn\u2019t what bothers him \u2014 it is instead someone studying criminology to become a better criminal instead of to pursue justice.\n\u201cIt was the assault on why I do what I do: promote justice and fairness, to find honor where there isn\u2019t any, to teach people to be decent human beings, and to realize that life goes on, and to let people who had not experienced respect from the system know that the power to move past their troubles is inside them.\u201d\nMost of the people he worked with throughout his career were in bad circumstances and needed help out of the abyss, while Kohberger chose to dive into it.\nThough this may be over for the public, for those affected it will never go away, and a feeling of safety is slow to return when you learn you have been in close contact with a monster.\nThis coming year is likely to be Snyder\u2019s last spent teaching, not just because of Kohberger \u2014 he has been working to make a more just society since 1988 and is tired.\nLet\u2019s hope some of the students he\u2019s taught over the last 10 years can pick up the torch and none of them turns out to be the next Bryan Kohberger.\nAs for his former TA, it is John\u2019s belief that being both extremely irritating and physically weak he won\u2019t survive to the end of his natural life in prison.\nBrad Pearce writes The Wayward Rabbler on Substack."
