  "description": "the personalities of young people are changing - and not in a good way. The implications for work and career are bad: distracted, unmotivated, asocial and anxious staff?",
  "content": "It is commonplace to observe that there is something deeply wrong with young people today. Socrates bemoaned the trend of the young to write things down. He feared it would weaken the mind and mean they \u201cseem to know many things\u201d without truly knowing them.\n\nThe introduction of the telephone set off a moral panic that it would hasten life beyond human endurance and the new \u201cinstant contact \u201c would encourage gossip, trivial chatter, and moral decline.\n\nNow we read that a psychological earthquake is taking place amongst younger Americans (and presumably the rest of the rich west). Between roughly 2014 and 2022, people aged 16\u201339 experienced really big declines in conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion, while neuroticism climbed.\n\nJohn Burn\u2011Murdoch at the Financial Times graphically illustrated how dramatic this shift is. Trait scores like discipline, cooperation, and social engagement have fallen off a cliff, while emotional volatility is on the rise.\n\nIn the working world, conscientiousness is gold dust. It\u2019s the trait most closely linked to getting things done \u2014 showing up on time, following through on promises, and staying the course when challenges mount. If the trait is truly eroding among younger workers, organisations may find themselves managing teams less able to focus, deliver, and take ownership \u2014 a problem magnified by the constant digital interruptions of modern life.\n\nThe social fabric of work is no less vulnerable. Agreeableness and extraversion are the invisible threads that help teams gel, foster trust, and draw people into productive collaboration. When they decline, relationships become transactional and the easy camaraderie that makes work enjoyable and connected starts to fray.\n\nHigher neuroticism means greater sensitivity to stress and negative emotion, which can tip into anxiety, depression, or burnout. People like this make poor team mates and just aren\u2019t fun to be around. The risks multiply with low conscientiousness: poorer self-care, inconsistent health habits, and a greater likelihood of chronic illness.\n\nThese data fit the common narrative about rising anxiety and depression, the fall in the numbers of friends young people have and the rise of loneliness, and the dearth of romantic opportunities.\n\nWhat changed? Jonathan Haidt calls it \u201cthe great rewiring.\u201d Beginning in the late 2000s, adolescents became the first generation to journey tethered to smart phones, those engines of attention which drive attention, isolation and social comparison.\n\nOn top of this, the pandemic was a multiplier. So was the enormous rise in economic inequality and diminishing job prospects for the young. Here comes AI. Would you really want to be young again in these times?\n\nHowever, we survived writing, the printing press, telephones, radio and tv. Instant contact didn\u2019t ruin a generation. Before we settle on a story of irreversible decline, it\u2019s worth asking: Is this a modern moral panic? What else might explain these shifts? After all, personality is much more malleable than we once thought, so could the data represent not a collapse of character, but an adaptation to a changing world?\n\nEminent psychologist Prof Fred Oswald suggested to me that these are average differences across groups. This hides how much variation there is at the individual level, nor the variability inherent in the measures themselves. Without person-to-person measurement over time we can\u2019t tell whether the pattern is a broad, population-wide shift or the average of many people moving in different directions.\n\nLower conscientiousness in young adults may partly reflect adaptation to an economy valuing flexibility, multitasking, and rapid information processing over long, sustained tasks. Things look different if we measure agility, digital collaboration, or networked problem-solving as core traits.\n\nPersonality traits, especially conscientiousness and agreeableness, typically rise with age. The pandemic may have delayed the traditional \u201csocial investment\u201d milestones (stable jobs, marriage, home ownership) that drive maturation, shifting the curve rather than changing the endpoint. The authors of these studies suggest the drop might be more of a pandemic aftershock than a generational inevitability. If so, these traits might rebound as social structures stabilise.\n\nSurveys capture self-perception, which can be influenced by cultural narratives. In an era that normalises talking about anxiety and mental health, people may report higher neuroticism without there being a true trait increase.\n\nWhat to Do?\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I believe the data are on to something. I know first-hand about Gen Z\u2019s struggles with mental health and anxiety, and I think Jonathon Haidt is dead-on in his analysis of attention economies, screen-saturated routines, and diminishing real-world play on building character. It\u2019s possible a generation has shifted in the way it shows up, but hold your fire for now.\n\nIn any event, we also know what helps: unstructured play in the physical world, meaningful offline connection, and institutional norms that prioritize psychological maturity over digital distraction. If conscientiousness can erode under the right conditions, perhaps it can be nurtured back through intentional everyday practices: exercise rituals, accountability, focused work, and rhythms that restore presence. (I really hope that doesn\u2019t sound too much like Jordan Peterson, but hey).",

      "text": "November 9, 2023\nGeneration Z and the Transformation of American Adolescence: How Gen Z\u2019s Formative Experiences Shape Its Politics, Priorities, and Future\nAcknowledgment\nThe American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Survey Center on American Life is grateful to the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation for its generous support of this research.\nIntroduction\nGenerational categories, such as baby boomers, Generation X, millennials, and Generation Z, are ubiquitous in American culture, featuring prominently in news stories, marketing materials, and published research. Despite their prevalence, there is not a universally accepted definition of generational boundaries, and even the labels themselves are points of contention. The media\u2019s cavalier usage of generational labels has contributed to public confusion and received justifiable criticism, but generational cohorts remain important analytical categories for many reasons.\nIn the United States, generational cohorts have distinctive demographic profiles. For instance, about half of Generation Z is non-Hispanic white, compared to more than seven in 10 baby boomers (71 percent). The religious composition differs significantly as well. More than one in three Gen Z adults identifies as religiously unaffiliated, roughly twice as many as baby boomers. Further, Gen Z adults are about five times more likely than baby boomers to identify as LGBTQ.\nBeing a member of a more diverse generation increases the probability of regular social interactions with people who do not share your racial or religious background, sexual identity, or sexual orientation. Diversity exposes people to a wider array of backgrounds and encourages commitment to pluralism. It\u2019s not a coincidence that Gen Z adults are more likely than older generations to believe that America\u2019s diversity is a source of strength for the country.\nGenerational differences extend beyond demographics. In Generations, Jean Twenge argues that the widespread adoption of new technologies that transformed American society also created unique generational experiences. Twenge suggests that \u201ctechnological change isn\u2019t just about stuff; it\u2019s about how we live, which influences how we think, feel, and behave.\u201d[i] For instance, equipping teenagers with smartphones that offer instant virtual access to their friends has reduced the incentives to spend time with friends in person. As a result, we find that Gen Z adults spent far less time during their teenage years simply hanging out with friends face-to-face than did any previous generation.\nLastly, generations are distinct to the extent that their members hold in common certain formative experiences that shape their view of the world and sense of their place in it. The earliest work on generations focused on major events that catalyzed a distinctive orientation. But these events are not the only formative experiences that matter. Rather, routine patterns of behavior, norms, and beliefs established in childhood exert considerable influence over our adult lives.\nCompared to previous generations, Generation Z is more likely to have been raised in smaller families by older parents who are spending more time outside the home. Census data show that in two-parent households, young adults today are far more likely to have both parents working full-time, a shift from previous generations. Personal choices and professional demands altered the structure of family life in ways that profoundly reshaped young adults\u2019 formative experiences. In a past study, we found that only 38 percent of Generation Z adults reported having meals with their family on a daily basis when they were growing up.[ii] In contrast, more than three-quarters of baby boomers (76 percent) said having regular family meals was part of their childhood experience.\nIf generational cohorts are meaningfully different, then it is worth identifying and measuring them in surveys. In cross-sectional studies like this one, reliably comparing generations is challenging because these categories are confounded by age. Baby boomers are substantially older than millennials and Gen Z, and therefore their financial circumstances, personal and professional responsibilities, and relationship dynamics are going to reflect that fact. As we age, our social context evolves in important ways as well. How we spend our time and who we spend it with changes a lot between our early 20s and late 50s. Accounting for life-stage differences is crucial if we want to understand the unique way that generation shapes people\u2019s lives and experiences.\nOne solution to this problem is to use longitudinal data to compare identical age groups at different periods of time. This is the approach taken by the Pew Research Center. In a recent post, Kim Parker writes that the center will only undertake \u201cgenerational analysis when we have historical data that allows us to compare generations at similar stages of life.\u201d This method allows researchers to control for age differences. As Parker notes:\nWhen doing this kind of research, the question isn\u2019t whether young adults today are different from middle-aged or older adults today. The question is whether young adults today are different from young adults at some specific point in the past.[iii]\nPew has gone so far as to update certain generational comparisons[iv] to illustrate this transition to age-period-cohort analysis.\nIn the current survey, one approach we adopt is to measure differences in adolescent experiences as a way of holding age differences constant. This is achieved through a series of questions about a variety of activities and experiences, such as participating in youth athletics, dating, working a part-time job, and talking to a therapist. Because we ask respondents to recall past behaviors and events\u2014sometimes experiences that occurred a long time ago\u2014we focus less on precise measurements of frequency and attempt to identify whether certain activities represent a significant part of their teenage experience.\nDespite this measurement approach, memory bias\u2014the tendency to remember past events or experiences in ways that accord with the current emotional state\u2014is a potential problem. This issue is especially problematic when asking respondents to reflect on past emotional experiences, such as feelings of loneliness. However, it is possible to validate cross-sectional survey results by comparing them to longitudinal data. In the current study, our findings that document the relative high rates of reported teenage loneliness among Generation Z are consistent with longitudinal research that shows young people today experiencing much higher rates of social disconnection than young adults did in previous eras.[iv]\nStill, a word of caution is warranted. Regardless of the definition, generations include individuals born over a number of years, and as a result, there is considerable diversity among generational cohorts. The cultural touchstones and technological experiences of the oldest and youngest members of a particular generation are sure to be different. What\u2019s more, the growing diversity in racial and ethnic identity, religious affiliation, and sexual identity and orientation means that experiences of younger generational cohorts are likely more varied than those of previous generations that are more demographically homogenous.\nThese facts complicate generational comparisons, but they do not make these categories irrelevant. Recognizing the limitations of generational analyses will allow us to better appreciate how these categories can elucidate changes in American life.\nGenerational Changes in Teen Experiences and Activities\nIf generational categories are meaningful, then we ought to observe measurable differences in formative experiences across different cohorts. In a number of ways, the teen experiences of younger generations diverge sharply from those of older generations, whether that is in alcohol and drug use, the pursuit of romantic relationships, religious participation, or the amount of time spent with friends.\nDelayed Adulthood: Work and Relationships\nMost Americans have their first romantic experiences and develop their first relationships during their teen years. However, American teenagers are increasingly less likely to have a romantic partner\u2014a boyfriend or girlfriend\u2014than they once were. Fifty-six percent of Gen Z adults report having had a boyfriend or girlfriend as a teenager, while 41 percent say they did not have this experience. Nearly seven in 10 (69 percent) millennials and more than three-quarters of Generation Xers (76 percent) and baby boomers (78 percent) say they had a boyfriend or girlfriend for at least some part of their teen years.\nThere are not sizable gender differences in dating experiences, but men are somewhat less likely than women to have had a consistent romantic partner throughout their teen years. The generational gap in teenage dating experiences among men is stark. Gen Z men are more than twice as likely as baby boomer men to report that they did not have a significant other as a teenager (44 percent vs. 20 percent).\nWorking a part-time or summer job was once a ubiquitous experience for cash-strapped teenagers, but today\u2019s teens are less likely to take on these responsibilities. Fifty-eight percent of Gen Z adults say they had a part-time job at some point during their teen years. Close to four in 10 (38 percent) Gen Z adults say they did not have a part-time job as a teenager. For previous generations, part-time work was much more prevalent. Seven in 10 (70 percent) millennials, nearly eight in 10 (79 percent) Generation Xers, and 82 percent of baby boomers worked in a part-time position as a teenager.\nNew Patterns: Religion, Drugs, and Alcohol\nFor a time, religious involvement and drug use were inversely related: The more time teens spent at church, the less likely they were to be involved with drugs or alcohol. For young people today, that relationship has been completely decoupled. Gen Z adults report low levels of religious participation and drug and alcohol use.\nNo generation reports lower levels of religious involvement as teens than Generation Z. Only about half (52 percent) of Gen Z adults say they attended religious services regularly during their teen years. Forty-five percent report that they did not participate at all in religious services as teenagers. A majority (58 percent) of millennials and nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of Generation X say they attended services regularly during at least part of their teen years. More than seven in 10 (71 percent) baby boomers say they were regularly involved in a church or congregation at some point during their teen years.\nAlcohol and drug use is less prevalent among young adults today than it was for previous generations. Less than one-third (32 percent) of Gen Z adults report occasionally drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes or marijuana for at least part of their teen years. Forty-three percent of millennials and more than half of Generation X (52 percent) and baby boomers (54 percent) report that they occasionally smoked or drank as teenagers. Close to two-thirds (65 percent) of Gen Z adults say that smoking pot or cigarettes or drinking alcohol was not a regular part of their teen experience.\nFor millennials, Generation Xers, and baby boomers, lower involvement in religion as a teenager is associated with a higher likelihood of alcohol and drug use. However, this relationship is weak for Gen Z. Among Gen Z adults who report having regularly attended religious services during their teen years, 34 percent say they also drank, smoked, or used drugs during at least some of this time. The rates of reported alcohol and drug use among Gen Z adults who never participated in religious services is remarkably similar. Less than one-third (32 percent) say they engaged in drug use or alcohol consumption as teenagers.\nYouth Athletics and Outdoor Activities: A Shrinking Gender Divide\nTeen involvement in athletics and outdoor activities, such as scouting and hunting, is on the decline. However, in both cases, men are responsible for most if not all of the falloff.\nHalf of Americans report having participated in competitive team sports during all of (23 percent) or at some point in (27 percent) their teen years. Forty-eight percent report not having participated in competitive sports during this time.\nParticipation in youth athletics is higher today than it was in an earlier era, but the trend masks a crucial gender divide. Young women participate at much higher rates today than did older women, while young men are less involved in competitive sports as teenagers than were previous generations of men.\nFor men, youth athletics are a less central part of adolescent experience than they once were. Fifty-two percent of Gen Z men say they played a competitive sport for at least some time as a teenager. In contrast, older men report much higher rates of involvement in youth sports: 63 percent of Generation X and 64 percent of baby boomer men say they played during at least part of their teen years. Close to half (45 percent) of Gen Z men never participated in competitive sports as a teenager.\nThe generational pattern among women is partially reversed. Young women today are much more likely than previous generations to have participated in competitive sports during their teen years. Nearly half (46 percent) of Gen Z and millennial (47 percent) women report having played competitive sports as a teenager, an experience far less common among baby boomer women. Fewer than three in 10 (29 percent) baby boomer women say they played competitive sports at any time during their teenage years.\nA similar pattern emerges in participation in outdoor activities. Men consistently report greater participation than women in scouting and outdoor activities, but the gender gap is shrinking due to men\u2019s waning involvement. Two-thirds (67 percent) of baby boomer men and a majority (58 percent) of Generation X men report being involved in hunting or scouting at some point during their teenage years. In contrast, less than half of millennial men (45 percent) and Gen Z adult men (42 percent) engaged in these types of activities as teens.\nTeen Loneliness and Friendship Experiences\nHanging out with friends in person was once a defining part of the teenage experience, but it has become increasingly uncommon. More than half of Americans (53 percent) report that they regularly socialized with their friends during most or all of their teen years. Thirty-three percent said they did this during some of their teen years, while only 13 percent say they did not regularly hang out with friends as a teenager.\nYoung Americans today are less likely than previous generations to have spent a lot of time socializing with their friends. Seventy-eight percent of Generation Z adults report that they spent at least some of their teen years regularly hanging out with friends. More than eight in 10 millennials (84 percent), Generation Xers (89 percent), and baby boomers (88 percent) say they spent time with friends during a good part of their teen years.\nThe generational gap is even more pronounced when comparing the extent to which in-person socializing occurred throughout teenage years. No group of Americans spent more time with friends during all of their teen years than did Generation X. Sixty percent of Generation Xers say they spent most or all of their teen years hanging out in person with friends. More than half of baby boomers (52 percent) and millennials (54 percent) say they spent a lot of time with friends as teenagers, but only 40 percent of Generation Z adults report that this was their experience. Nearly one in five (19 percent) Gen Z adults say they did not spend any of their teen years regularly socializing with friends.\nSince teenage socializing occurs less often than it once did, it is not surprising that feelings of loneliness and social isolation are more prevalent than they once were. More than six in 10 (61 percent) Gen Z adults say they felt lonely or isolated during at least some of their teen years. Fifty-seven percent of millennials say the same. Fewer Generation Xers (44 percent) and baby boomers (36 percent) say they felt lonely often during some part or most of their teen years.\nAn Increase in Teen Therapy\nAmerican teens are heading to therapy at growing rates. More than one in four (27 percent) Generation Z adults\u2014including nearly one-third (31 percent) of Gen Z women\u2014report that they spent at least some of their teen years talking to a therapist. Twenty percent of millennials also report that they talked to a therapist at some point during their teen years.\nFor Generation X and baby boomers, therapy was a fairly rare experience. Only 10 percent of Generation X Americans and 4 percent of baby boomers spent any time in therapy as teenagers.\nBullying\nBeing bullied is an unfortunate experience for many teens, and the frequency of bullying experiences has changed little over the years. Thirty-eight percent of Gen Z adults and close to half (45 percent) of millennials report being bullied as a teenager. Thirty-nine percent of Generation Xers and about one-third (32 percent) of baby boomers also report that they were bullied as teenagers.\nFor teenagers, being overweight is associated with a much greater likelihood of being bullied. Roughly one in four (26 percent) Americans report that they were overweight during some or all of their teen years. Half (50 percent) Americans who say they were overweight as a teenager report that they were bullied. In contrast, only about one in three (34 percent) Americans who were not overweight as a teenager report being bullied at some point during their teen years.\nTeen athletes report less frequent experiences of bullying than those who did not participate in youth sports, but only for men. Men who report participating in sports throughout their teenage years are significantly less likely to report being bullied than are those who did not participate at all (29 percent vs. 42 percent).\nGay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans report much higher rates of teen bullying than do Americans who identify as straight. A majority (56 percent) of gay and lesbian Americans and 62 percent of those who identify as bisexual say they were bullied during their teen years, compared to 35 percent of Americans who are straight or heterosexual.\nLonely teenagers report much more frequent bullying experiences. Seventy percent of Americans who report feeling lonely throughout their teenage years say they were bullied. Only 22 percent of Americans who say they did not feel lonely as a teenager say they were ever bullied, a nearly 50-point gap. Lonely teenagers might serve as easier targets for bullies, but it\u2019s also possible that bullied teenagers are left feeling more isolated from the experience. Americans who report being bullied as teenagers report feeling lonely much more often than those who were not.\nAmericans raised by a single parent are more likely to report being bullied as a teenager than those who were raised in two-parent households, but the difference is only evident among those with college-educated parents. A majority (52 percent) of Americans raised by a college-educated single parent say they were bullied as a teenager, compared to 35 percent of those from two-parent households in which both parents are degree-holders. Among Americans raised by parents without college degrees, there is no significant difference in bullying experiences between those raised in single- versus two-parent households.\nPrivate Art and Music Lessons\nThere are only modest generational differences in the likelihood of having taken private art or music classes. Thirty percent of Gen Z adults say they took private art or music lessons at some point during their teen years, compared to about one in four millennials (26 percent) and baby boomers (24 percent) and one in five (22 percent) Generation Xers.\nGen Z women report much higher levels of participation in art and music classes as teenagers than do Gen Z men. More than one in three (35 percent) Gen Z women say they were enrolled in private art or music classes during at least some of their teenage years. Fewer than one in four (24 percent) Gen Z men report that they took art or music lessons as teenagers.\nThe Class Divide in Teen Experience\nAmericans raised in two-parent married households where both parents had a college degree have remarkably different experiences as teenagers than those raised in households where neither parent was college-educated. Participation in youth athletics is much more common among Americans raised in households with two college-educated parents. Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of Americans raised by parents with at least a four-year degree say they were involved in competitive sports during their teen years. In contrast, among those raised in households where neither parent had a degree, less than half (46 percent) report participating in sports.\nPrivate music and art lessons are also much more common for Americans raised in more-educated households. Americans who were raised by college-educated parents are nearly three times more likely to have been enrolled in private art or music lessons as a teenager than those raised by a single parent without a college education (44 percent vs. 16 percent, respectively).\nFamily Structure, Parental Education, and Teen Religious Participation\nFor Americans over age 50, their parents\u2019 educational background is not closely connected to their religious participation. Among Americans raised by parents with four-year degrees, 70 percent said they participated regularly in religious services during some if not all of their teen years. Those raised by parents without a degree report similar levels of religious activity: 64 percent participated regularly during some part of their teen years.\nFor Americans under age 50, their parents\u2019 educational background seems to make a difference. Among Americans under age 50 who were raised by college-educated parents, 69 percent said they went to church regularly for some or all of their teen years, compared to 56 percent of those without college-educated parents.\nIf parental education has become more strongly associated with childhood religious involvement, family structure appears to have consistently affected Americans\u2019 formative religious experiences. Across generations, Americans raised by married parents report more regular religious participation in adolescence than those raised by single parents or those who had other family arrangements. Americans raised by a single parent are far less likely to have participated in religious services as teenagers than those who grew up in two-parent households. More than two-thirds (68 percent) of Americans raised in two-parent married households say they participated in religious services for at least some time during their teen years. In contrast, slightly more than half (53 percent) of those raised by a single parent report regularly participating in religious services during some or all of their teen years.\nThe Varying Influence of Parental Politics\nA robust academic literature[vi] has shown that parents\u2019 political preferences have a considerable influence on their children\u2019s views. Consistent with these findings, the survey reveals a strong connection between parental voting behavior and the subsequent political affiliation of children. Overall, 62 percent of Americans raised by parents who always or nearly always voted for Democratic candidates identify as Democrat. Similarly, 57 percent of Americans whose parents always or nearly always voted Republican now identify with the Republican Party.\nHowever, the transmission of political values across generations is not consistent. For baby boomers, their parents\u2019 political behavior exercised a similar influence regardless of whether their parents were Democrats or Republicans. Sixty percent of baby boomers raised by parents who consistently voted for Democratic candidates report being a Democrat today. Conversely, a nearly identical 59 percent of Americans raised by parents who uniformly supported Republican candidates are Republican.\nFor younger generations, the influence of parental political preferences is uneven: Democratic parents appear to more effectively inculcate a particular political orientation in their children than do Republican parents. More than three-quarters (76 percent) of Gen Z adults raised in a Democratic household identify as a Democrat. However, among Gen Z adults raised in a Republican household, only 60 percent say they are a Republican. The pattern among millennials is remarkably similar. Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of millennials with Democratic-voting parents say they are a Democrat, but less than half (47 percent) of millennials raised by Republican parents identify as Republican today.\nGeneration Z: Transition into Adulthood\nThe oldest Generation Z adults are in their mid-20s. The youngest are preteens. These years represent a time of considerable instability and uncertainty, as young adults develop academic interests and intellectual pursuits, establish important relationships, and decide on the type of life they want to lead. Their personal concerns, feelings of loneliness, and search for meaning reflect a generation in transition, rather than a permanent state of being. Gen Z experiences are the experiences of young adults.\nHowever, formative experiences are not irrelevant. Many of the acute feelings of loneliness that characterize Gen Z adolescence will influence their decision-making as adults. Gen Z\u2019s unique approach to sexual identity and orientation and their eschewing of traditional labels may change their understanding of themselves, who they are, and where they fit in.\nA Generational Moment: The COVID-19 Pandemic\nHalf of the American public said the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally altered the course of their life. Fifteen percent of Americans report their lives were affected a \u201cgreat deal,\u201d and 35 percent said the pandemic influenced their lives a fair amount. Thirty-seven percent of Americans report that the pandemic\u2019s influence over the course of their life was marginal, while 12 percent report that their lives were not changed at all.\nThe lives of younger Americans were uniquely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty percent of Gen Z adults and 59 percent of millennials report that the pandemic influenced the trajectory of their lives either a great deal or a fair amount. Less than half (47 percent) of Generation X and 43 percent of baby boomers report that the pandemic altered their lives in a meaningful way.\nGiven the myriad ways the pandemic upended ordinary Americans\u2019 lives, the survey included a follow-up question asking those who reported that their life was affected by the pandemic to elaborate in their own words. Overall, Americans whose lives were affected by the pandemic report that effect as negative, rather than neutral or positive.[vii]\nMore than six in 10 (62 percent) Americans whose lives were substantially affected by the pandemic and who detailed that impact in an open-ended response report the effect was negative. Roughly one in five (19 percent) report that their pandemic experience ultimately influenced their life in a positive direction, and 15 percent report a neutral effect, neither positive or negative.\nLife Trajectory: Not Going as Planned\nIn thinking about their life experiences, Americans are generally more likely to say that their life has gone in an unexpected direction than they are to say things generally turned out how they thought they would. More than four in 10 (44 percent) Americans say their life has turned out differently than they expected. One-third (33 percent) say things have turned out the way they thought they would, and more than one in five (22 percent) say they never gave much thought to how things in their life would go.\nThere are few differences in views across generations. However, women are more likely than men to report that their life has gone in an unexpected direction. A majority (54 percent) of millennial women, compared to less than half (46 percent) of millennial men, say their life has taken an unexpected turn. Gen Z women are also more likely than Gen Z men to say things have turned out differently than they expected (48 percent vs. 39 percent). The pattern is just as stark between baby boomer women and men (45 percent vs. 34 percent).\nAcross generations, Americans raised in two-parent households by college-educated parents are more likely to report that their life has turned out as they expected it would. Forty-two percent of Americans raised by college-educated parents report that their life has gone how they thought, compared to 30 percent of those raised in a single-parent household and 32 percent of those raised by two parents without college degrees.\nPersonal Optimism\nEven as pessimism in politics has become ubiquitous, young people remain optimistic about the direction of their own lives. Seventy percent of Gen Z adults say their best days are ahead of them. Fifty-eight percent of millennials, less than half (46 percent) of Generation Xers, and only one in three (33 percent) baby boomers say their best days are ahead of them.\nFeelings of Loneliness\nFeelings of loneliness and social isolation are associated with age: Younger Americans consistently report these feelings more often than older Americans do. Nearly one in four (24 percent) Gen Z adults say that over the past 12 months, they have always or often felt lonely. Eighteen percent of millennials, 12 percent of Generation Xers, and 7 percent of baby boomers report feeling lonely this frequently.\nHowever, the pronounced feelings of social disconnection and isolation among young adults today may not entirely be an artifact of age. There is a strong connection between teen loneliness and feelings of social isolation in adulthood. This pattern is evident across generations, even for Americans who were teenagers a long time ago. Twenty percent of baby boomers who report that they were lonely most or all of the time as teenagers say they often felt lonely over the past 12 months. In contrast, only 4 percent of baby boomers who were not lonely as teenagers report having felt this way often in the past year. The gap is even larger among younger generations. Forty-two percent of Generation Xers who felt lonely for most or all of their teenage years say they often felt lonely in the past year, compared to 7 percent of Xers who were not lonely as teenagers. The gap is similar among millennials and largest among Gen Z adults (56 percent vs. six percent).\nCreating a Meaningful Life\nMost Americans feel that their life is meaningful at least sometimes, but fewer often feel this way. Less than half (49 percent) of Americans say in the past 12 months they have felt their life is meaningful either always or often. Fifty percent of the public says they have felt this way only sometimes (28 percent), rarely (13 percent), or never (9 percent).\nWhile generational differences between Gen Z, millennials, and Generation X are not significant, the oldest generations stand out in believing their lives are meaningful. Less than half (45 percent) of Gen Z adults, millennials (44 percent), and Generation Xers (46 percent) say they have felt their life was meaningful always or often over the past 12 months. A majority (56 percent) of baby boomers say they always or often have felt their lives were meaningful.\nAmericans who have never married, are not religious, and have lower levels of formal education feel their lives have meaning less often than other Americans do. Only about four in 10 (43 percent) Americans with a high school degree or less say they always or often have felt that their life is meaningful during the past 12 months. Roughly half (52 percent) of Americans with a four-year college degree and 57 percent of Americans with a postgraduate education report these same feelings.\nMarried Americans also report feeling that their lives are meaningful more frequently than those who have never married. More than half (53 percent) of married Americans say over the past 12 months they have always or often felt their life had meaning, compared to 41 percent of those who have never married.\nOverall, religious Americans tend to believe their life is meaningful more often than do those who are not religious. These feelings are especially pronounced among white evangelical Protestants and Latter-day Saints (Mormons). More than six in 10 (62 percent) Latter-day Saints and a majority (56 percent) of white evangelical Christians say in the past 12 months they always or often have felt their life has meaning. In contrast, only 42 percent of religiously unaffiliated Americans say the same.\nAn Uncertain Sense of Self\nFor many Americans, adolescence and early adulthood are periods of self-discovery and self-doubt. Younger Americans are far more likely than older Americans to report they have felt uncertain about who they are supposed to be. More than half (53 percent) of Gen Z adults and nearly half (47 percent) of millennials say they have felt unsure about who they are supposed to be at least once in a while over the previous 12 months. In contrast, only 28 percent of Generation Xers and 16 percent of baby boomers say they have wondered about who they are supposed to be in the past 12 months.\nYoung women more than young men report feeling greater uncertainty about their sense of who they are. Sixty percent of Gen Z women and 46 percent of Gen Z men say that over the past year they have occasionally felt \u201cuncertain about who they were supposed to be.\u201d\nPart of the gender divide may be attributable to the larger share of women who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Americans who identify as bisexual, gay, or lesbian report more frequent feelings of uncertainty about who they are than do most other Americans. Two-thirds (67 percent) of Americans who identify as bisexual say in the past 12 months they have sometimes felt unsure about who they were supposed to be. Close to half of gay and lesbian adults (48 percent) report feeling this way as often. Americans who identify as straight or heterosexual are far less likely to feel unsure about who they are; 29 percent report this feeling within the past year.\nConcerns About Career, Finances, and Friendship\nFor Generation Z adults, concerns about relationships, career, and finances likely reflect their current situation rather than a permanent condition. Personal priorities change substantially over the life course in response to changing roles, such as becoming a parent and taking on new financial responsibilities.\nHaving Enough Friends\nYounger adults are generally more preoccupied with friendship dynamics than are older Americans. This might be because young adults spend more time with friends and rely more on their friends for social support than do older adults. Nearly half (48 percent) of Gen Z adults say they worry at least once in a while about having enough friends, compared to 39 percent of millennials, 29 percent of Generation Xers, and 25 percent of baby boomers.\nGen Z women report that they worry about their friendship circles far more often than do Gen Z men. Nearly six in 10 (57 percent) Gen Z women say they worry at least sometimes over whether they have enough friends, compared to 41 percent of Gen Z men. A narrower but still significant gap also exists among baby boomer women and men (28 percent vs. 22 percent). Notably, there is no gender gap among millennials or Generation X.\nFinding a Meaningful Job or Career\nYounger Americans also report greater concern about finding a meaningful job or career. Seventy percent of Gen Z adults say they at least occasionally worry about finding a job or career that is meaningful. A majority (60 percent) of millennials also report that they are concerned about finding a meaningful career at least sometimes. Far fewer Generation Xers (43 percent) and baby boomers (17 percent) report having these concerns, perhaps reflecting either different professional priorities or being at different stages of their respective careers.\nA gender gap is evident among Gen Z adults, with women reporting greater concern about finding a meaningful career than men. Three-quarters (75 percent) of Gen Z women and about two-thirds (66 percent) of Gen Z men say they worry at least once in a while about whether they will be able to attain a meaningful job or career.\nFinancial Security\nConcerns about financial security cut across generations, with a notable exception. More than half of Gen Z adults (60 percent), millennials (56 percent), and Generation Xers (52 percent) say they worry at least sometimes about having enough money to pay their bills. Baby boomers feel significantly more secure in their finances; only 38 percent say they worry at least once in a while about being able to pay their bills. A majority (61 percent) of baby boomers say this is something they rarely or never worry about.\nGen Z Politics: A Growing Gender Divide and Formative Distrust\nThe politics of Generation Z lean liberal, but not necessarily Democratic. Fewer than one in three (32 percent) Gen Z adults identify as Democrat, compared to about one in five (21 percent) who are Republican. Twenty-nine percent of Gen Z adults are politically independent. Notably, 16 percent say their politics fall into another category; they identify as \u201csomething else,\u201d meaning that close to half of Gen Z adults do not identify with either major political party.\nDespite being less attached to either political party, Gen Z adults are much more liberal than conservative in their political leanings. Nearly four in 10 (39 percent) identify as liberal, 32 percent identify as moderate, and roughly one in four (26 percent) are conservative.\nPrevious research identified a growing gap in ideological orientation between young men and women. The gender gap in liberal identity is notable among members of Generation Z, but it\u2019s relatively modest. Forty-three percent of Gen Z women identify as liberal, compared to 35 percent of Gen Z men. However, the gender divide among white non-Hispanic Gen Z adults is considerable. Close to half (46 percent) of white Gen Z women are liberal, a far greater share than white Gen Z men, among whom only 28 percent identify as liberal. Among Gen Z adults, white men are significantly more likely than white women to identify as politically conservative (36 percent vs. 26 percent). The ideological differences between men and women in other age cohorts are comparably modest.\nPublic trust in government has been falling for years. Polling shows that few Americans have much confidence that the federal government acts in the best interests of the citizenry or believe that political leaders can be trusted to act honestly and ethically. However, formative political experiences vary considerably across generations, with older Americans reporting greater confidence in political leaders during their childhood years. Only about one-third of Gen Z adults (34 percent) and millennials (34 percent) agree with the statement \u201cWhen I was growing up America\u2019s political leaders could generally be trusted.\u201d More than six in 10 Gen Z adults (62 percent) and millennials (63 percent) say that during their formative years, political leaders were generally not to be trusted. Views of older Americans are starkly different. A majority of Generation X (54 percent), two-thirds of baby boomers (66 percent), and eight in 10 Americans of the Silent Generation (80 percent) agree that political leaders when they were growing up could basically be trusted to do the right thing.\nSocial Media and Social Connection\nGen Z adults are prolific users of social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok. Seven in 10 (70 percent) Gen Z adults use social media daily, including 55 percent who report spending time on social media sites multiple times a day. Millennials\u2019 social media usage is nearly as high. Two-thirds (67 percent) of millennials report using social media every day, including nearly half (49 percent) who are on social media multiple times a day. Nearly six in 10 (59 percent) Generation Xers and just over half (51 percent) of baby boomers are visiting social media sites daily, though they are far less likely to be on these sites multiple times (39 percent and 29 percent, respectively).\nWomen use social media more often than men, a pattern that is consistent across generations. Three-quarters (75 percent) of Gen Z women are on social media daily, with 61 percent logging onto these sites multiple times a day. Less than two-thirds (65 percent) of Gen Z men use social media at least once a day, with less than half (49 percent) reporting multiple visits a day.\nNot only do Gen Z adults use social media more often than other generations, they also use social media somewhat differently. Gen Z adults who use social media report spending more time connecting with friends by posting or sending messages. This is especially true of those who spend the most time on social media platforms. Nearly half (48 percent) of Gen Z adults who check in multiple times a day report that they are \u201coften\u201d or \u201cnearly always or always\u201d interacting with friends while on social media. In contrast, millennials (35 percent), Generation Xers (31 percent), and baby boomers (42 percent) report interacting with friends on social media somewhat less often.\nSocial media was conceived of as a way of connecting people, but it can also make users feel like they are missing out. On balance, Americans who use social media are more likely to say it makes them feel connected than that it leaves them with fears of missing out. Roughly three-quarters (72 percent) of Americans who use social media report that it makes them feel more connected to other people. One in four (25 percent) say it makes them feel like they are missing out.\nMillennials are most likely to report feelings of being left out when they use social media. More than one in three (35 percent) millennials report that after using social media, they are more likely to feel left out than connected to others. Twenty-nine percent of Gen Z adults feel the same. Generation Xers (23 percent) and baby boomers (16 percent) who use social media are far less likely to report that they feel like they\u2019re missing out.\nAmericans who spend more time on social media are less likely to feel like they are missing out than those who infrequently use these platforms. One-third (33 percent) of Americans who report using social media a few times a month say spending time on social media platforms makes them feel like they are missing out, greater than the share of daily users (24 percent).\u2019\nVideo Games and Online Gaming\nPlaying video games has become a much more common activity for Americans of all ages. Thirty-four percent of Americans report having played video games within the past week, including nearly one-quarter (24 percent) who report playing in the past 24 hours. However, video-game usage continues to be much heavier among young adults.\nGeneration Z has the largest proportion of regular gamers. A majority (56 percent) of Gen Z adults reported that they have played video games in the past week. Fewer millennials (41 percent), Generation Xers (29 percent), and baby boomers (25 percent) report playing video games in the past week.\nVideo-game usage skews male across the board, especially among Gen Z adults. Four in 10 (40 percent) American men report having played video games in the past week, compared to 28 percent of women. The gender divide in gaming is starkest among Gen Zers, with more than seven in 10 (71 percent) Gen Z men reporting that they have played video games within the past week. Only about four in 10 (41 percent) Gen Z women play this often. There is also a considerable gap among millennials. More than half (52 percent) of millennial men and fewer than one in three (30 percent) millennial women report having played in the past week. The gender gap shrinks considerably among Generation X and disappears completely among baby boomers.\nFor most Americans, video gaming is a solitary activity. Among Americans who report having played video games in the past month, 69 percent say they typically play by themselves. Thirty percent say they usually play with someone else, either online or in person.\nPlaying games with others is much more common among younger Americans, especially among younger men. Gen Z men are not only most likely to play video games; they are also most likely to play with their friends. When asked if they usually play alone or with someone else (either in person or online), Gen Z men are as likely to report that they typically play with a friend (49 percent) as to say they generally play by themselves (49 percent). In contrast, almost seven in 10 (68 percent) millennial men, three-fourths (74 percent) of Generation X men, and over four in five (84 percent) baby boomer men say that they typically game alone.\nSocial Media, Gaming, and Sociability\nResearch tracking various types of activities[viii] generally finds that young people spend more time with friends than do older people. Interestingly, the current survey reveals only modest generational divisions in the time Americans spend with friends in person, challenging existing analyses that suggest time spent with friends drops rapidly as we age.\nGen Z adults spend time with friends in person at a slightly lower rate than do older Americans. Sixty-one percent of Gen Z adults report having spent time with their friends in the past seven days (including 36 percent reporting that they have spent time with friends in the past 24 hours), while 59 percent of millennials, 64 percent of Generation Xers, and 69 percent of baby boomers report the same.\nSocial media use and video games are often identified as factors responsible for increased feelings of loneliness and social isolation, but the current survey reveals no association between these activities and sociability. Americans who spend more time on social media or playing video games do not report spending less time with friends than do more-frequent users. Among Gen Z adults and millennials, the most frequent social media users are actually more likely to spend time with friends in person than are those who report that they never use these platforms (63 percent vs. 54 percent).[ix]\nLGBTQ Identity and Sexual Attraction\nRecent surveys have revealed a growing generational gap in LGBTQ identity.[x] Young adults today are much more likely than young people in previous generations to identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.\nNearly nine in 10 Americans (88 percent) identify as straight or heterosexual. Five percent identify as bisexual, 3 percent as gay or lesbian, and 2 percent as something else.\nIn the US, sexual orientation and identity vary considerably by age; however, generational patterns are not completely linear. Almost one in four (23 percent) Gen Z adults and 17 percent of millennials identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or something else. In contrast, nearly equal numbers of Generation X (6 percent) and baby boomers (5 percent) identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or something else.\nGenerational differences are primarily driven by the increase in bisexual identity among younger age cohorts. Thirteen percent of American Gen Z adults identify as bisexual, more than six times greater than the corresponding share of baby boomers.\nOverall, there are only modest gender differences in sexual identity and orientation, but these differences are entirely driven by the large divisions among Gen Z adults. Nearly one in three (31 percent) Gen Z women identify as lesbian, bisexual, or something else. Fewer than one in five (16 percent) Gen Z men identify as gay, bisexual, or something else. The gender gap is nonexistent among Generation X and baby boomers and modest among millennials.\nSexual identity is strongly associated with political ideology, especially among younger Americans. Young liberals are far more likely than political moderates or conservatives to identify as something other than heterosexual. Nearly half (48 percent) of liberal Gen Z women and 29 percent of liberal Gen Z men identify as gay or lesbian, bisexual, or something else. Just over half (51 percent) of liberal Gen Z women identify as heterosexual or straight, compared to 69 percent of liberal Gen Z men.\nSexual Attraction\nOverall, the vast majority of Americans report being attracted exclusively to the opposite sex. Women are somewhat more likely than men to report fluidity in their feelings of sexual attraction. Eighty-seven percent of men and 81 percent of women say they are attracted to only people of the opposite sex. Notably, gender differences mostly disappear among older Americans.\nThe gender gap is most pronounced among Gen Z adults. Only about six in 10 (61 percent) Gen Z women report that they are physically attracted to exclusively men, while roughly three-quarters (76 percent) of Gen Z men say they are attracted to only women. Three in 10 (30 percent) Gen Z women report that they are attracted to both men and women.\nHow Stable Is Sexual Attraction?\nFor most Americans, feelings of sexual attraction have been fixed throughout their lives. Ninety-one percent of Americans report that their own feelings of sexual orientation have not changed at all. Nine percent say that their sexual preferences have changed over time. A gender difference emerges, with women slightly more likely than men to report their sexual preferences have changed (10 percent vs. 7 percent).\nGenerational differences are modest. Close to one in five (17 percent) Gen Z adults report that their feelings of physical attraction have changed at some point. Fewer millennials (11 percent), Generation Xers (6 percent), and baby boomers (5 percent) say their sexual orientation has evolved throughout their life.\nSexual Orientation: Nature or Nurture?\nAmerica is divided on whether being gay or lesbian is innate or the result of upbringing and environment. Fifty percent of Americans say sexuality is innate. Thirty-two percent say one\u2019s upbringing or environment is the larger driver of sexual identity. Six percent of Americans cite a combination of both factors, while 8 percent say some other reason entirely.\nDespite the greater diversity in their sexual orientation and identity, Gen Z adults tend to be more closely divided over the factors associated with sexual orientation. Less than half (46 percent) of Gen Z adults believe that being gay or lesbian is an innate quality. Forty-three percent say it is due to factors such as upbringing or someone\u2019s environment (36 percent) or is the result of both (7 percent). Six percent of Gen Z adults say sexual orientation is the result of some other factor.\nCan Sexuality Change Over Time?\nThere is a massive gender divide in views about sexual orientation. Only 38 percent of Gen Z men believe being gay or lesbian is the result of genetic factors, while roughly as many (40 percent) say it is due to a person\u2019s upbringing. In contrast, a majority (54 percent) of Gen Z women believe that sexual orientation is an innate characteristic.\nIdeological differences also loom large in views about sexual orientation. Seventy-six percent of liberals say sexual orientation is innate. In contrast, half (51 percent) of moderates and only 27 percent of conservatives agree. Instead, 51 percent of conservatives cite environmental factors, along with just 30 percent of moderates and 12 percent of liberals.\nGen Z\u2019s Declining Support for Same-Sex Marriage\nAt one time, the issue of same-sex marriage sharply divided Americans by age, with younger adults expressing the most intense support and older Americans far more opposed. There is some indication that this generational gap is contracting, with Gen Z adults expressing lower support for same-sex marriage than they once did.\nToday, two-thirds of Americans strongly (46 percent) or somewhat (20 percent) support allowing gay and lesbian people to marry. Less than one-third somewhat (13 percent) or strongly (18 percent) oppose same-sex marriage.\nAlthough younger Americans continue to express stronger support for same-sex marriage than do older adults, the age gap has shrunk. Today, Gen Z adults are not much more supportive of same-sex marriage than are baby boomers. Sixty-nine percent of Gen Z adults favor allowing gay and lesbian people to marry, compared to 73 percent of millennials, 65 percent of Generation Xers, and 61 percent of baby boomers. As recently as 2021, eight in 10 (80 percent) Gen Z adults reported supporting same-sex marriage.[xi] There is no evidence of a similar drop among any other generation.\nFeminism, Gender Discrimination, and Equality\nWhen it comes to views on gender-related issues, there is a clear gender gap among Gen Z adults that is more pronounced than among older generational cohorts. These different perspectives between young men and women coincide with a series of events that were uniquely salient for young women. The #MeToo movement was a defining cultural moment for many young women, informing their views about the treatment of women in society. Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016 was another formative event for many young women, who remained uniquely opposed to him throughout his presidency. Finally, the overturn of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that established a right to abortion, was a uniquely salient issue for young women, who identified it as their most crucial concern in the months following.\nGender Discrimination and Mistreatment of Women\nRoughly three in 10 (32 percent) Americans report that they have personally experienced discrimination based on their gender, including 5 percent who say this is a regular occurrence. More than two-thirds (68 percent) of Americans report never having personally experienced gender discrimination.\nWomen are far more likely than men to report experiencing gender-based discrimination. Nearly half (45 percent) of women report this has happened at least occasionally. Only 17 percent of men say they have faced discrimination because of their gender.\nReported experiences of gender-based discrimination and mistreatment are more common among young women than older women. Half (50 percent) of Gen Z women and a majority (55 percent) of millennial women say that they have been mistreated or discriminated against because of their gender at some point in their lives. Generation X and baby boomer women are somewhat less likely to report having these experiences; 42 percent and 39 percent say they have faced gender discrimination, respectively.\nNotably, Gen Z men are much more likely than older men to report facing gender-based discrimination. Nearly one in four (23 percent) Gen Z men report this experience, compared to 20 percent of Generation X men, 14 percent of baby boomer men, and 6 percent of Silent Generation men.\nGenerational differences in reported experiences pale in comparison to ideological differences. Liberal women are considerably more likely than conservative women to report having ever experienced gender discrimination or mistreatment (66 percent vs. 30 percent). In fact, liberal women stand out on this item regardless of age. Sixty-six percent of Gen Z liberal women report having experienced gender discrimination, compared to 34 percent of Gen Z conservative women.\nFeeling Respected by the Opposite Gender\nMen and women report vastly different experiences when it comes to feeling respected by people of the opposite sex. Women are twice as likely to report that they have been treated disrespectfully by men at least once in a while over the previous 12 months (34 percent vs. 17 percent, respectively). A majority (54 percent) of men report never having felt this way over the previous 12 months.\nThe gender gap is much larger among young people. Half (50 percent) of Gen Z women say they have felt that men don\u2019t respect them at least occasionally over the previous 12 months. Only 18 percent of Gen Z men report having felt disrespected by women.\nAre Women and Men Treated Equally in Church?\nMost Americans do not believe that churches and religious congregations treat men and women equally. Forty-two percent of the public says that most churches and congregations treat men and women the same; a majority (57 percent) of the public disagrees.\nPublic perceptions vary only modesty by generation. More than half of Generation Z (56 percent), millennials (63 percent), Generation X (52 percent), and baby boomers (56 percent) say that religious institutions do not generally treat men and women equally.\nWomen generally are less likely to agree that churches treat men and women equally, but the pattern varies considerably across generations. The most pronounced gender gap is found among Gen Z adults. Nearly half (49 percent) of Gen Z men believe that churches and religious congregations treat men and women equally, compared to only 30 percent of Gen Z women. Millennial men (35 percent) and women (32 percent) report remarkably similar views about how men and women are treated by religious institutions.\nBiological Differences Between Men and Women\nOverwhelmingly, Americans affirm the statement: \u201cThere are important biological differences between men and women.\u201d Ninety percent of the public agrees with this statement while just 10 percent of Americans reject it.\nSimilar numbers of men and women believe there are important biological differences between men and women. Ninety-one percent of men and 87 percent of women believe this is the case.\nGenerational differences on this item are somewhat muted, but the strength of agreement varies widely. Eighty percent of Gen Z adults, 85 percent of millennials, 92 percent of Generation Xers, and 94 percent of baby boomers agree that there are important biological differences between the two genders. However, the confidence with which Gen Z adults affirm this fact differs from older generations. Less than half (48 percent) of Gen Z adults completely agree that important biological differences exist between men and women, compared to 73 percent of baby boomers.\nThe Gen Z Gender Gap on Feminism\nAmericans are divided over whether they would consider themselves a feminist. About half (48 percent) of the public says they think of themselves as a feminist, while, statistically, the same share (49 percent) disagrees.\nWomen are more likely than men to identify as a feminist, but differences are not substantial. Fifty-three percent of women identify as a feminist, compared to 43 percent of men.\nGender differences are markedly different across generations. Millennial (52 percent vs. 54 percent) and Generation X (43 percent vs. 49 percent) men and women are equally likely to identify as a feminist. Baby boomer men are less likely than women to claim the feminist label. The gender gap in feminist identity is only significant among baby boomers and Generation Z. Thirty-eight percent of baby boomer men and 50 percent of baby boomer women claim the label. However, it is among Generation Z that feminist identity is most polarized. Sixty-one percent of Gen Z women identify as feminist, compared to 43 percent of Gen Z men\u2014an 18 percentage point gap.\nEven if most Americans do not identify as a feminist, a majority believe that feminism has made America a better place. Nearly six in 10 (59 percent) Americans agree that feminism has improved American society. Thirty-nine percent disagree.\nThe gender divide in views about feminism\u2019s benefits mirrors that in feminist identity. Women are 10 percentage points more likely than men to say that feminism has benefited the United States (63 percent vs. 53 percent).\nGenerational patterns are also similar. The largest gender gap in views about feminism is found among Generation Z adults. Nearly seven in 10 (69 percent) Gen Z women and 52 percent of Gen Z men agree that feminism has made America a better place. The gender gap is still significant, but notably smaller, among millennials, Generation Xers, and baby boomers.\nConclusion\nComparing generational cohorts provides a unique way of illuminating political and social divisions in the United States and offers us the opportunity to glimpse at where society is headed.\nChanges in technology, culture, and family life have led Generation Z to have distinct formative experiences. Compared to previous generations, Gen Z adults participated in outdoor activities less often, had fewer romantic experiences, and were much less likely to hold down a part-time job. They have less experience participating in religious communities than any previous generation. Whether social media or video games, technology has played a much more significant role in their adolescence than for any previous generation. As technological and societal changes accelerate, the differences between generations will grow, making them more relevant.\nAt this early stage, it\u2019s difficult to know in exactly what ways the COVID-19 pandemic has altered American society. What is already apparent is that young adults were uniquely affected by the economic turmoil, social disconnection, and political acrimony created by the pandemic. No generation was more influenced by the pandemic than Generation Z, and most Gen Z adults felt that during their childhood, political leaders were not acting in good faith\u2014a notable difference from the adolescent experiences of Generation Xers and baby boomers. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may take years to fully play out, and it may do so in ways that are not immediately detectable in surveys.\nIn the near term, many of these experiences may result in greater hardship, a more pervasive sense of dislocation, and more acute feelings of insecurity. If we take a longer view, we may find Generation Z develops a deeper appreciation of the importance of family relationships, civic connection, and social solidarity.\nAbout the Authors\nDaniel A.

Interviews were conducted among a random sample of 5,055 adults (age 18 and up) living in the United States, including all 50 states and the District of Columbia. All interviews were conducted among participants of the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the US general population, not just the online population. Interviews were conducted in Spanish and English between August 11 and August 20, 2023.\nInitially, participants were chosen scientifically by a random selection of telephone numbers and residential addresses. Persons in selected households were then invited by telephone or mail to participate in the Ipsos KnowledgePanel. For those who agreed to participate but did not already have internet access, Ipsos provided a laptop and internet service provider connection for free. People who already had computers and internet service were permitted to participate using their own equipment. Panelists then received unique log-in information for accessing surveys online and were sent emails throughout each month inviting them to participate in research.\nThe data were weighted to adjust for gender, race and ethnicity, education, census region, household income, race by gender, race by age, and race by education. The sample weighting was accomplished using an iterative proportional fitting process that simultaneously balances the distributions of all variables.\nThe use of survey weights in statistical analyses ensures that the demographic characteristics of the sample closely approximate the demographic characteristics of the target population. The margin of sampling error for the qualified survey sample is +/\u2013 1.4 percentage points at the 95 percent level of confidence. The design effect for the survey is 1.08.\nNotes\n[i] Jean M.

The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented opportunity to examine whether personality changed during a stressful global event. Surprisingly, two previous studies found that neuroticism decreased early in the pandemic, whereas there was less evidence for change in the other four traits during this period. The present research used longitudinal assessments of personality from the Understanding America Study (N = 7,109; 18,623 assessments) to examine personality changes relatively earlier (2020) and later (2021\u20132022) in the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels. Replicating the two previous studies, neuroticism declined very slightly in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic levels; there were no changes in the other four traits. When personality was measured in 2021\u20132022, however, there was no significant change in neuroticism compared to pre-pandemic levels, but there were significant small declines in extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The changes were about one-tenth of a standard deviation, which is equivalent to about one decade of normative personality change. These changes were moderated by age and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, but not race or education. Strikingly, younger adults showed disrupted maturity in that they increased in neuroticism and declined in agreeableness and conscientiousness. Current evidence suggests the slight decrease in neuroticism early in the pandemic was short-lived and detrimental changes in the other traits emerged over time. If these changes are enduring, this evidence suggests population-wide stressful events can slightly bend the trajectory of personality, especially in younger adults.\nCitation: Sutin AR, Stephan Y, Luchetti M, Aschwanden D, Lee JH, Sesker AA, et al.

This published work has focused understandably on factors related to mental health. Many studies, for example, examined how symptoms of depression and anxiety [2], loneliness [3, 4], and social support [5] changed compared to before the pandemic. In addition to aspects of mental and social well-being, the pandemic may have had an impact on more general ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving (i.e., personality). The five-factor model (FFM) [6] of personality operationalizes trait psychological function along five broad dimensions: neuroticism (the tendency to experience negative emotions and vulnerability to stress), extraversion (the tendency to be talkative and outgoing), openness (the tendency to be creative and unconventional), agreeableness (the tendency to be trusting and straightforward), and conscientiousness (the tendency to be organized, disciplined, and responsible). These traits are relatively stable over time [7] but are theoretically thought to be responsive to environmental pressures [8], including stressful events. The coronavirus pandemic has offered the unique opportunity to examine how a global stressful event experienced by the whole population may change personality.\nPrevious research suggests that personal, but not collective, stressful events may be associated with personality change. Neuroticism, for example, has been found to increase after personal stressful [9, 10] or traumatic [11] events. In contrast, collective stressful events, such as natural disasters, seem to be unrelated to personality change [12, 13]. A study that examined personality change from before to after the 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, for example, found no change in any of the five traits from before to after the disaster (there was a slight increase in neuroticism among participants directly affected by the quake; [12]). In addition, in a sample measured twice after exposure to Hurricane Harvey, there was no evidence of mean-level change in any of the five traits, even among participants with the most exposure [13]. This literature thus suggests that personality traits are not responsive to natural disasters.\nIn contrast to natural disasters, which tend to be limited in geographic area, the coronavirus pandemic has affected the entire globe and nearly every aspect of life. There is a developing literature on how the pandemic might be shaping personality change. Early in the pandemic, during the acute phase, we examined personality change in a sample of adults from across the United States (ages 18\u201390). We hypothesized that neuroticism would increase because of pandemic-related stressors and the accompanying fear and uncertainty would lead to more feelings of emotional instability [14]. Surprisingly, however, neuroticism declined slightly between January/February 2020 and March 2020. Although surprising, it is consistent with anecdotal evidence that anxiety (one core aspect of neuroticism) declined early in the pandemic among individuals who typically suffer from anxiety [15]. Further, a small sample from Germany found that neuroticism was slightly lower among university students during the first coronavirus lockdown compared to their neuroticism measured before the pandemic [16]. Although modest, this current evidence suggests that, at least early in the pandemic, during the acute phase, there was a decline in neuroticism.\nThere is less evidence for change in the other traits from pre- to during the pandemic. Although extraversion was hypothesized to decline because pandemic restrictions (e.g., lockdowns, social distancing, event cancellations) reduced the ability to be sociable, the evidence is mixed: Extraversion decreased slightly in a sample of university students in Germany [16], whereas it did not change in a nationwide sample of adults in the United States accounting for sociodemographic characteristics [14]. No change was found for Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness in the American sample [14], and these traits were not measured in the German sample [16].\nThese two studies provided important insights into the early effect of the pandemic on personality. The present research builds on these initial findings in four critical ways. First, we seek to replicate the finding that neuroticism declined early in the pandemic in a larger national sample of adults in the United States. Second, we address whether the other traits changed in this larger and more diverse sample than the previous samples. Third, with assessments of personality in both 2020 and in 2021\u20132022, we evaluate differential patterns of personality change across the acute (2020) and adaptation (2021\u20132022) phases of the pandemic. Finally, with a relatively diverse sample, we test whether personality change was moderated by age, gender, race, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, or education.\nTo put any potential change in personality in context, previous research has found that personality changes, on average, about one-tenth of a standard deviation per decade of adulthood [17]. Regarding direction, neuroticism, extraversion, and openness tend to decline from younger to older adulthood, and agreeableness and conscientiousness tend to increase, although neuroticism and conscientiousness may change direction and increase and decrease, respectively, in older adulthood [17]. Although personality traits may change more in younger and older adulthood, compared to middle adulthood, we do not make specific predictions about age differences in personality change during the pandemic because the virus and the response to it has been unprecedented and its effects significant but different across age groups. Older adults, for example, faced a greater threat of severe disease and death, whereas younger adults faced more restriction on age-normative activities. If any differences are found, it would suggest a fruitful future direction to pursue to identify theoretical and empirical reasons for differential personality change by age. If changes are similar across age, it would suggest that personality is reactive to a global stressful event regardless of specific age-related stressors.\nThe purpose of this research is to examine personality change during the coronavirus pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels using longitudinal assessments of personality from the Understanding America Study (UAS) [18]. We construe these analyses as exploratory because this study will be the first study of change in personality measured relatively earlier (acute phase) and relatively later (adaptation phase) in the pandemic (pandemic assessments in 2020 and 2021\u20132022), and because previous findings were not consistent with theoretical expectations. We do expect, however, that neuroticism declined early in the pandemic because of the two previous studies. If this decline is apparent in the UAS sample, it will provide robust evidence that neuroticism was reactive to the pandemic. We do not expect change in the other four traits early in the pandemic based on our previous findings [14]. We do not make predictions about change in personality later in the pandemic or how change may differ by sociodemographic characteristics.\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants and procedure\nUAS is an internet panel study of participants across the United States administered by the University of Southern California [18]. Participants completed surveys through the device of their choice (desktop, laptop, mobile, etc.) and, when necessary, were provided with a device and internet access to participate. To date, the UAS has administered the same personality measure three times (UAS1, UAS121, UAS237). Personality in UAS1 was collected between May 2014-March 2018, personality in UAS121 was collected between January 2018-April 2020, and personality in UAS237 was collected between April 2020-February 2022 (see COVID section below for how assessments were categorized for analysis). All participants had personality measured at least once prior to the pandemic. Because of the sampling structure of UAS, participants reported on their personality again in either 2020 or 2021\u20132022, but did not report on their personality in both years. As such, for all participants there is one assessment of personality during the pandemic; all available personality data was used in the analyses. Documentation for each wave can be found at the UAS website: https://uasdata.usc.edu/index.php under \u201cSurveys\u201d and UAS1, UAS121, and UAS237. Participants were included in the analytic sample if they had personality data reported during the pandemic and at least one personality assessment prior to the pandemic. Participants also needed to have sociodemographic information available. A total of 7,109 participants met these criteria, for a total of 18,623 assessments (Mean = 2.62 assessments/participant, SD = .48; range = 2\u20133; n = 4,495 at UAS1, n = 7,019 at UAS121, n = 7,109 at UAS 237). The current analyses were based on publicly-available, de-identified data and thus did not require approval from the local IRB. The primary data collection was overseen by the IRB at the University of Southern California and written informed consent was obtained from participants. Detailed information about the original data collection, ethical oversight, and consent process can be found in Laith and colleagues [18].\nThe analyses in this paper were not preregistered and are exploratory. The data used in the current analyses can be downloaded from: https://uasdata.usc.edu/index.php?r=eNpLtDKyqi62MrFSKkhMT1WyLrYyNAeyS5NyMpP1UhJLEvUSU1Ly80ASQDWJKZkpIKaxlZKlhYmSdS1cMG0-Euo. Note that data are available but users must first register for a free account with UAS before the link will direct them to the dataset for download. The analytic scripts are in supplementary material.\nMeasures\nPersonality traits.\nPersonality was measured with the 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI) [19] at each personality assessment. Participants rated items that measured neuroticism (e.g., can be moody; eight items), extraversion (e.g., is talkative; eight items), openness (e.g., has an active imagination; ten items), agreeableness (e.g., is generally trusting; nine items), and conscientiousness (e.g., is a reliable worker; nine items). Items were rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), reverse scored when necessary, and the sum taken in the direction of the domain label (e.g., higher scores on neuroticism indicated greater neuroticism). Although sum scores can sometimes be problematic for missing data, at each personality assessment, more than 99% of participants who completed the assessment had personality scores, which indicated that missing data were not a problem in this study. Scores on neuroticism and extraversion could range from 8 to 40, scores on openness could range from 10 to 50, and scores on agreeableness and conscientiousness could range from 9 to 45. The test-retest correlation between the first and last personality assessment was .72 for neuroticism, .78 for extraversion, .73 for openness, .65 for agreeableness, and .69 for conscientiousness, indicating relatively high rank-order stability, which is similar to test-retest correlations reported during non-pandemic times: .71 for neuroticism, .79 for extraversion, .79 for openness, .70 for agreeableness, and .70 for conscientiousness (Hampson & Goldberg, 2006) [20]. There were some differences between participants who reported on their personality in 2021\u201322 versus 2020. Specifically, participants who reported on their personality in 2021\u20132022 were younger at baseline (d = .28, p < .01), had more years of education (d = .12, p < .01), were less likely to be men (\u03c72 = 10.51, p < .01) or Hispanic ethnicity (\u03c72 = 307.99, p < .01), and more likely to be Asian (\u03c72 = 111.25, p < .01) than participants who reported on their personality in 2020. After accounting for sociodemographic differences, participants who reported on their personality in 2021\u20132022 were lower on baseline neuroticism (d = .08, p < .01) and baseline conscientiousness (d = .10, p < .01) compared to participants who reported on their personality in 2020.\nSociodemographic covariates.\nSociodemographic factors were age in years at the first personality assessment, gender (0 = women, 1 = men), race (three dummy-coded variables that compared Black = 1, Asian = 1, and Otherwise-identified = 1 to white = 0), Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (1 = Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, 0 = not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) and education, reported on a scale from 1 (less than first grade) to 16 (doctorate degree). These covariates were selected because of potential age, gender, and education differences in personality and the differential effect of the pandemic across sociodemographic groups.\nCOVID.\nA variable was created that indicated whether each personality assessment occurred before or during the coronavirus pandemic. We set March 1, 2020 as the start of the pandemic for this sample because widescale closures and cancellations started to occur in the United States in early March 2020. Because patterns of personality change might be different depending on phase of the pandemic, we categorized the COVID personality assessments into two time periods: personality assessments during 2020 (March 1, 2020-December 31, 2020; the acute phase) and personality assessments after 2020 (January 1, 2021-February 16, 2022; the adaptation phase).\nStatistical approach\nThe trajectory of each personality trait was modeled on time. Time in years was calculated from the first personality assessment to each subsequent assessment. Multilevel modeling (MLM) was used to estimate the trajectory of personality over time (which represents normative developmental/age-related change over time), with random effects for intercept and slope. Level 1 was repeated assessments of personality nested within-person. Socio-demographic variables were entered at level 2 to control for age, gender, race, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and education. Following previous studies on pandemic-induced change in subjective age [21] and well-being [22] compared to pre-pandemic levels, we specified a change component that was a time-varying dummy variable that compared all personality assessments prior to the pandemic (May 2014-February 2020; pre-pandemic personality) to the personality assessments during the pandemic (March 2020-February 2022; which reflect normative history-related change during the pandemic). Two dummy-coded variables were created. The first coded personality measured between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 during the acute phase of the pandemic as 1 and others as 0. The second coded personality measured between January 1, 2021 and February 16, 2022 as 1 and others as 0. All participants in the analytic sample had one or two personality assessments prior to the pandemic and one personality assessment in either 2020 or 2021\u20132022 (because of the structure of UAS, personality assessments were not from the same participants in both 2020 and 2021\u20132022). The dummy-coded variable indicated whether personality measured during the pandemic increased or decreased during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nWe also tested whether personality change was moderated by sociodemographic factors (age, gender, race, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, education) by including an interaction term between each dummy-coded COVID variable and the sociodemographic factor in separate regressions for each interaction. For age, we also ran the same MLM analysis separately for three age groups: younger adults (<30 years old), middle-aged adults (30\u201364 years old), and older adults (\u226565 years old) because each age group had different challenges at different points in the pandemic. Due to the large number of tests and difficulty replicating interaction effects, the p-value was set to < .01 for the moderation analysis.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics for study variables are in Table 1. Table 2 reports results of the multilevel models that show personality change during the pandemic, accounting for the effect of time over the three assessments. Consistent with the previous studies on change in neuroticism early in the pandemic [14, 16], neuroticism was lower (approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation) in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic levels. This decline, however, was not apparent in the next phase of the pandemic; neuroticism measured in 2021\u20132022 was not statistically different than neuroticism measured prior to the pandemic. Note that the time trend for neuroticism was positive, which indicated that neuroticism increased over time. The negative coefficient for COVID indicated a decrease in neuroticism during the pandemic, despite the time trend of increases over time. A different pattern emerged for the other four traits. For these traits, there was no difference in 2020 compared to their pre-pandemic levels. Extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, however, declined in 2021\u20132022 compared to their level pre-pandemic.\nA different pattern of personality change was apparent when the sample was split into three age groups (Table 3). The divergence by age was largest for neuroticism (Fig 1). When was measured in 2020, older adults had the greatest decline in neuroticism. Middle-aged adults also declined in neuroticism, with an effect size about half that of older adults. Younger adults showed this initial decline, but it was not statistically significant. The bigger discrepancy across age groups occurred for personality measured in 2021\u20132022. In this case, middle-aged adults continued to decline in neuroticism at this later stage of the pandemic, as did older adults, albeit the decline was not statistically significant. In contrast, younger adults had a significant increase in neuroticism in 2021\u20132022 compared to prior to the pandemic. The pattern that emerged for the remaining traits was similar across the four traits, with declines for both younger and middle-aged adults in 2021\u20132022. There were two patterns particularly worth noting. First, the coefficients for agreeableness and conscientiousness were at least twice as large among younger than middle-aged adults, which indicated larger declines in this age group. Second, there was no significant change in these traits among older adults in either 2020 or 2021\u20132022: Extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness during the pandemic for participants over 65 were similar to pre-pandemic levels. The continuous interactions with age supported the overall pattern of age differences in personality change during the pandemic (S1 Table). Specifically, there was a negative interaction between COVID year and age on neuroticism for both 2020 and 2021\u20132022, which indicated the decline in neuroticism was larger at older ages in 2020 and the increase was larger at younger ages in 2021\u20132022, respectively. Likewise, the age interactions for agreeableness and conscientiousness indicated the decline in these two traits in 2021\u20132022 was stronger among relatively younger than relatively older participants. The interaction with age for 2020 for agreeableness was also significant.\nAge differences in the effect of the pandemic on personality change in 2020 and in 2021\u20132022 for neuroticism (Panel A), extraversion (Panel B), openness (Panel C), agreeableness (Panel D), and conscientiousness (Panel E). Asterisks indicate significant personality changes from pre-pandemic levels.\nPersonality change during COVID was also moderated by Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (S1 Table). Hispanic/Latino participants did not experience the decline in neuroticism apparent among non-Hispanic/Latino participants. Hispanic/Latino participants also decreased more in agreeableness earlier in the pandemic than non-Hispanic/Latino participants. Both Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino participants declined in extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness in 2021\u20132022, but this decline was larger for Hispanic/Latino participants. There was less evidence for differences by the other sociodemographic groups (S1 Table).\nDiscussion\nReplicating previous work on personality change in the acute phase [14, 16], the present research found a significant decrease in neuroticism in 2020 compared to neuroticism prior to the pandemic. There was no significant change in the other traits in 2020. There was, however, a different pattern of change when personality was measured in 2021\u20132022: The beneficial effect of the pandemic on neuroticism dissipated, whereas there was significant decline in the other four traits compared to before the pandemic. Importantly, significant age differences also emerged that indicated that the decline in neuroticism in 2020 was largest for older adults, whereas the decline in the other four traits in 2021 was apparent in middle-aged and particularly younger adults. The present research thus suggests differential acute and longer-term time of measurement effects of the pandemic on personality change.\nAt the sample level, change in personality from before to during the pandemic was approximately one-tenth of a standard deviation. Although modest in absolute terms, it can be put in the perspective of developmental changes that occur over adulthood. Normative personality change has been estimated to be approximately one-tenth a standard deviation per decade in adulthood [17]. Given our analyses accounted for these normative age-related changes, the change observed during the short time of the pandemic approximated the degree of change usually observed over a decade. In addition, the changes were much larger for some demographic groups, including the decline in neuroticism for older adults, the decline in conscientiousness for younger adults, and the decline in extraversion for Hispanic/Latino participants, which were about one-fifth of a standard deviation.\nThe present research adds to the replicated evidence that neuroticism declined early in the pandemic [14, 16]. This decline is particularly surprising against the backdrop of other longitudinal research on mental health that found symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress increased during the first year of the pandemic [1, 2, 23]. These findings appear contradictory, particularly because symptoms of depression and anxiety are expressions of neuroticism [24]. Both changes, however, may occur simultaneously. It may be that, prior to the pandemic, individuals higher in neuroticism ascribed feelings of distress to this dispositional aspect of themselves. The fear and uncertainty caused by the pandemic, however, may have provided a reason for such feelings, leading to declines in perceptions of dispositional neuroticism. Further, prior to the pandemic, there were no behavioral suggestions to express or cope with neuroticism, but pandemic guidance (washing hands, social distancing, masking) gave people a preventive behavior to engage in against the external stressor. The messaging around taking care of one\u2019s mental health may also have contributed to decreases in neuroticism, especially for older adults since so much of the messaging was around taking care of this age group. It is also possible that the greater social cohesion early in the pandemic brought a sense of belonging that lessened a general disposition toward distress and/or observing the distress in the world had individuals re-evaluate their own tendency towards fear and anxiety. Further, there may be social comparison processes that shape how individuals perceive themselves. That is, ratings of personality are based, in part, on comparisons to other people. Early in the pandemic, when there was a lot of reporting on fear and anxiety about the virus in the media and on social media, individuals may have viewed themselves as less fearful and anxious than those around them: Individuals may have viewed themselves as less neurotic because the social norms around neuroticism shifted. Three studies now document this decline in neuroticism early in the pandemic.\nA completely different pattern of change emerged during the adaptation phase of the pandemic. Neuroticism did not continue to decline, but rather was not statistically different from prior to the pandemic, which suggests the beneficial decline in neuroticism due to the pandemic was temporary. In addition, the other four traits, which did not change in the acute phase, all declined significantly in 2021\u20132022 compared to before the pandemic. This pattern suggests that for extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, there was either a delayed effect that took longer to become apparent and/or different stressors and strains later in the pandemic contributed to these changes rather than the stressors and strains earlier in the pandemic. One possibility is that the social cohesion apparent early in the pandemic helped support stability of these traits. That is, in the acute phase, despite fear and uncertainty, the increase in social support [3] and sense of community [25] may have helped maintain personality. The decline in social support [26] and increase in social conflict on pandemic-related protective measures [27], may explain at least part of change observed in 2021\u20132022.\nIn our first paper on personality change very early in pandemic, we hypothesized a decrease in extraversion and conscientiousness because of restrictions on social gatherings and the loss of daily routines that often give structure to one\u2019s life, respectively. We did not, however, find any support for these declines [14]. The present analyses suggest a delayed or longer-term effect on these traits. Early in the pandemic, there were anecdotal stories of long-lost connections being reestablished as old friends and acquaintances reached out to one another [28, 29]. Such connections may have helped support extraversion in the acute phase of the pandemic. Over a year of restrictions on social gatherings\u2013either mandated or self-imposed over safety concerns\u2013may have culminated in feeling less temperamentally outgoing than prior to the pandemic. Likewise, it might have taken more time for the lack of structure and fewer immediate responsibilities to consolidate into declines in conscientiousness. It may also be the case that, prior to the pandemic, external structures that supported schedules and routines were perceived as the individual\u2019s own level of conscientiousness. Without this stability and structure, it may be harder to be organized and follow through on responsibilities. The changes observed in 2021\u20132022 may be the accumulation of changes in daily life that took more time to culminate in trait decline.\nThere were also significant declines in openness and agreeableness. These declines may have been, in part, a response to the social upheaval in response to the pandemic that was sharper in 2021\u20132022. The continued uncertainty around the pandemic, particularly as it dragged into a second year [30], as well as the decline in mobility [31], may have led individuals to narrow their activities and worldviews. Likewise, there may have been a decrease in interest in art and artistic experiences because of less ability to engage in art due to closures of concert venues, museums, theaters, etc. The move to online communication and entertainment and reliance on social media may have decreased exposure to new ideas. Such changes may have contributed to declines in openness. There has been a decline in trust apparent for decades [17, 32]. Although there was an increase in confidence in science and the medical community early in the pandemic, this increase was short-lived and the decline precipitous during the second year of the pandemic [33]. The decline in agreeableness observed later in the pandemic is consistent with this trend. It is notable that this decline is apparent controlling for the general time trend of declines in agreeableness. This decline might have been partly fueled by amplification of mis/disinformation that undermines trust and may also highlight benefits to not being straightforward.\nTwo sociodemographic factors were significant moderators of personality change during the pandemic: age and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Compared to middle-aged and older adults, the personality of younger adults seemed particularly sensitive to change. Personality tends to develop most and consolidate during young adulthood [34], with the pattern of development toward greater maturity in the form of declines in neuroticism and increases in agreeableness and conscientiousness [35]. Over a year into the pandemic, however, young adults show the opposite of this developmental trend. The personality of older adults, in contrast, is thought to be more impervious to change (at least until very old age or cognitive impairment [36\u201338]); and, indeed, four of the five traits were relatively impervious to change among older adults. There may also be other reasons for the age differences in personality change. We cannot, for example, distinguish between age and cohort because they are confounded in the current sample; it is possible that the differences are due to cohort rather than age. It is also possible that different age groups faced different challenges in the second year of the pandemic, such as instability in the job market and school-related stressors (e.g., continued school closures, quarantining of the self or one\u2019s children after exposure). Such stressors may be more impactful for younger and middle-aged adults than older adults, who also may both be less likely to experience and have more resources to handle pandemic-related stressors that did occur.\nPersonality change during the pandemic was also moderated by Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. In 2020, Hispanic/Latino participants did not decrease in neuroticism but did decrease in agreeableness earlier than non-Hispanic/Latino participants. This pattern could be due, in part, to the strain of the pandemic not equally distributed across the population. The financial cost of the pandemic was larger for Hispanic/Latino adults compared to their counterparts [39], and, at the same time, this population had higher rates of hospitalization and death due to COVID than non-Hispanic white adults [40]. Further, the decline in extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness in 2021\u20132022 was stronger for Hispanic/Latino participants than non-Hispanic/Latino participants. Perhaps these declines were because of processes that may have been apparent across the population were amplified by ongoing stressors of high-risk work situations and risk of COVID for themselves and their families. Surprisingly, although Black adults faced similar stressors, in this sample, Black participants did not show a similar pattern of personality change (i.e., the moderation analysis indicated no difference in change between Black and white participants).\nThe present research focused on personality change during the coronavirus pandemic. It is important to note other significant collective events in the United States during this time. The death of George Floyd, the subsequent social justice protests, the backlash to the protests, and the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol are significant events that occurred during this time that may also have shaped the observed changes. More research needs to tease apart whether/how different events may have shaped personality change.\nImplications for models of personality\nThere are several theoretical accounts to explain personality development across the lifespan. Biologically-oriented models indicate personality in adulthood is relatively impervious to environmental pressures and changes that are not biologically-based should rebound [34]. Environmental models, in contrast, highlight life events in the trajectory of adult personality, although evidence on specific life events tends to be mixed and sometimes conflicting [8]. The neuroticism finding represents a significant time of measurement effect that replicated across three studies. We are not aware of similar population-wide effects that have replicated across independent studies. The findings suggest that a large scale, global event had an impact on personality at the population level. It appears that this decline was transitory; it is too early to determine whether the changes observed in 2021\u20132022 will endure or dissipate with time. It is also possible personal experiences and perceptions of collective events may be more impactful on personality than the event itself [41].\nPersonality traits go through most development in adolescence and early adulthood and tend to reach stability about age 30 [34]. At the other end of adulthood, personality tends to remain stable until cognitive impairment reduces stability [36]. It is notable, but perhaps not surprising, that most significant personality change during the pandemic occurred in younger adulthood, with most traits showing no change among older adults. It is further of note that middle-aged adults were more similar to younger adults than older adults (except for neuroticism). It is unclear whether this pattern is due to greater malleability of traits earlier than later in adulthood or whether the stressors and strains of the pandemic, which differed across age groups, led to more personality change.\nThese findings may have implications for long-term outcomes associated with personality. Individuals higher in conscientiousness, for example, tend to achieve more education [42] and income [43], develop fewer chronic diseases [44], are at lower risk of dementia [45], and ultimately live longer [46]. The decline in conscientiousness, particularly for younger adults, may have consequences for these outcomes, especially if the decline is not transitory. Higher neuroticism is associated with engagement in health-risk behaviors [47, 48] and is a risk factor for poor mental health outcomes [24]. This increase may make some individuals more vulnerable to poor outcomes. It is especially worrying that the largest changes in these two traits were among younger adults, as the implications of these changes may ripple throughout their adult lives.\nAlthough there should be some confidence in the decline in neuroticism, given that it has replicated, the other findings need to be interpreted with caution until replicated. It is of note that the lack of personality change in 2020 replicated our previous study on personality change in the acute phase of the pandemic (but Krautter and colleagues [16] found a decrease in extraversion during this time in a sample from Germany). Most importantly, the changes that occurred in 2021\u20132022 need to be replicated and put in the context of the sample. The sample was large and used a well-established measure of personality. The sample, however, was from the United States. No part of the world escaped the pandemic, but the course and response to the virus varied considerably across countries, and even within the same country. More research is needed to evaluate personality change during the pandemic in other cultural contexts and populations. In addition, although our sample was fairly diverse, the percentage of people of color was relatively low. The sample may have been underpowered to detect different patterns of personality change for people of color (the sample of Hispanic/Latino participants was larger and thus more powered to detect differences). This research documents personality traits over the first two years of the pandemic but the changes cannot be attributed solely to the pandemic. As discussed above, political and social upheaval co-experienced with the pandemic may have also contributed to the observed changes. We identified a time of measurement effect on change but were unable to distinguish the specific reasons for the changes. Pandemic-related policies and restrictions may be an additional contextual factor that is important for personality change. In the present research, participants were from around the United States who experienced very different state government responses to the pandemic (e.g., California versus Florida). Future research could address whether specific policy differences across states or countries have different impacts on change. Also, with few assessments of personality per participant, it was not possible to test for nonlinear changes over time. Future research would benefit from more assessments of personality to be able to test for such change. Further, there may be personality change related to infection with SARS-CoV-2, particularly for individuals with severe cases and/or long COVID. Recent evidence indicates significant changes in brain structure and cognitive function associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Douaud et al., 2022) [49]. Personality change could be one outcome of such alterations in neurological structure. The present research could not address this possibility. Finally, it would be worthwhile to take a \u201cnuance\u201d approach [50] and analyze change in specific items of the BFI to determine whether changes were driven by specific components of each trait.\nDespite these limitations, the present research offers new evidence for longitudinal change in personality across the pandemic. This research highlights the need to continue to assess longitudinal changes, as the pandemic may have cumulative effects that were not apparent in the first few months. This research also highlights the differential impact on personality change across demographic groups (e.g., young adults, Hispanic/Latino). Future research needs to continue to track trends in personality change to evaluate potential longer-term outcomes associated with this change, particularly for groups impacted the most.\nSupporting information\nS1 Table.

      "text": "Background\nCommon mental disorders (CMDs), including anxiety, depression, and non-specific stress, are highly prevalent mental health conditions, contributing to substantial psychological distress and reduced social functioning. In a given year, nearly 20% of individuals meet the criteria for CMD and 25% during their lifetime (Steel et al., Reference Steel, Marnane, Iranpour, Chey, Jackson, Patel and Silove2014). CMD accounted for 12.5% of sickness absences in the United Kingdom in 2018 (Office for National Statistics, 2018) and remained a leading cause of absences through 2020 (11.6%) despite the emergence of COVID-19-related sickness (14.0%) (Office for National Statistics, 2020). Globally, CMD contributes to a substantial proportion of disability-adjusted life years lost, with depressive disorders accounting for 1.5% and anxiety disorders accounting for 1.1% (Vos et al., Reference Vos, Lim, Abbafati, Abbas, Abbasi, Abbasifard and Murray2020).\nThe CMD burden varies across population groups, with higher rates among females, lower socioeconomic groups, residents of deprived neighbourhoods, and individuals with chronic conditions (Doherty & Gaughran, Reference Doherty and Gaughran2014; Fone et al., Reference Fone, Greene, Farewell, White, Kelly and Dunstan2013; Muntaner, Eaton, Miech, & O'Campo, Reference Muntaner, Eaton, Miech and O'Campo2004; Steel et al., Reference Steel, Marnane, Iranpour, Chey, Jackson, Patel and Silove2014). Age, ethnicity, and region also influence CMD patterns, with historically marginalised groups experiencing a disproportionate burden of CMD (Cooper et al., Reference Cooper, Bebbington, McManus, Meltzer, Stewart, Farrell and Livingston2010, Reference Cooper, Spiers, Livingston, Jenkins, Meltzer, Brugha and Bebbington2013; Lewis & Booth, Reference Lewis and Booth1992). Socioeconomic conditions play a critical role, as economic downturns, job loss, and reduced income have all been associated with worsened mental health outcomes (Brignone et al., Reference Brignone, George, Sinoway, Katz, Sauder, Murray and Kraschnewski2020; Muntaner et al., Reference Muntaner, Eaton, Miech and O'Campo2004). The effects of economic crises may particularly impact historically marginalised groups, exacerbating mental health inequalities.\nFollowing the 2007\u201308 global financial crisis, many countries, including the United Kingdom, implemented austerity measures ostensibly to curb public debt and stimulate the economy. These measures, initiated in 2010, included cuts to health and social services, effectively eroding social support and welfare systems and resulting in growing poverty and income inequality across the United Kingdom (Innes & Tetlow, Reference Innes and Tetlow2015). These entrenched inequalities resulting from a decade of austerity measures were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The confluence of these wide macrosocial and economic changes in the last 20 years has the potential to dramatically change rates of CMD across the population. Despite the importance of examining long-term trends of CMD, there is little research in this area.\nOur study aimed to investigate the temporal trends in the annual incidence of CMDs in the UK adults using primary care data from 2000 to 2020. We used a broad case definition of CMDs, including anxiety, depression, and stress-related symptoms, disorders, and pharmaceutical treatment. Further, we estimated stratum-specific estimates across key sociodemographic variables. Our hypothesis was that recorded CMD incidence would rise in the decade following the financial crisis of 2007\u201308, and that these increases would be more pronounced in more deprived areas. As a secondary aim, we explored CMD incidence separately by type to assess if the temporal trends could be attributed to changes in diagnosis and symptom recording or pharmaceutical treatment.\nMethods\nStudy design and data source\nWe created a longitudinal cohort of over 29 million UK adults aged \u226516 years registered to a general practice using de-identified individual electronic health records (EHRs) from the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum and Gold databases (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, 2021a, 2021b). As practices can change databases, we de-duplicated the data where patients were present in both Aurum and Gold. CPRD includes individual consultation records from general practitioners (GPs) and contains patient demographic information, symptoms, diagnoses, prescriptions, referrals to secondary care, and death date. CPRD is broadly representative of the UK population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity, and region (Herrett et al., Reference Herrett, Gallagher, Bhaskaran, Forbes, Mathur, Van Staa and Smeeth2015).\nCohort entry occurred when participants were at least 16 years of age and registered at their general practice for at least 12 months between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2020. Cohort exit occurred when patients left the practice, died, or developed CMD, whichever was earliest. CPRD data were linked to Office for National Statistics (ONS) death registration data, as death dates are more accurately recorded in ONS compared to CPRD. When only the year of death was available, we used the median calendar date in that year (2 July) as the death date. This study was approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee for CPRD research (Protocol 21_000354). This protocol was agreed by co-authors and pre-registered on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/ka7uw/).\nOutcomes\nThe outcomes of this study were a record of CMD within primary care. CMD codes included (i) symptoms or diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, or a depressive disorder, or a mixed depressive and anxiety disorder, or stress, or (ii) pharmaceutical treatment for an anxiety or depressive disorder, including prescriptions for antidepressants and anxiolytics. Clinical procedures, assessments, diagnoses, symptoms, and prescriptions are recorded in patient records using Read and SNOMED codes (online Supplementary Appendix 1 for code list).\nCMDs are commonly recurrent, episodic disorders over lifetimes. We used the clinical expertise of GPs (KW & SG) and a psychiatrist (DO) on our research team to define an incident episode of CMD. The first record of CMD diagnoses, symptoms, or pharmaceutical treatment in primary care records was considered an incident episode. Further, an individual was classified as having an incident episode of CMD when a new CMD episode was recorded in their primary care records where there had been no such code in the prior year, allowing us to capture the recurrent episodic nature of CMD across the life course (Kaster et al., Reference Kaster, Vigod, Gomes, Wijeysundera, Blumberger and Sutradhar2021; Wang et al., Reference Wang, Manuel, Williams, Schmitz, Gilmour, Patten and Birney2013). We reviewed data from 1 January 1999 to exclude prevalent cases at the start of follow-up (1 January 2000). For similar reasons, we excluded the first year of registration at a practice to avoid misclassifying prevalent cases who had transferred from another practice or were receiving treatment for CMD elsewhere.\nCovariates\nWe included sex (female, male), age (10-year age groups), ethnicity, nation (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales), and physical comorbidity as covariates. We included region and area-level deprivation for those registered to English practices.\nWe categorised patients into five ethnic groups: Asian, Black, mixed, other, White, or unknown, based on recorded values in their patient records. Patients with multiple ethnicity codes were categorised in the following way. When all recorded ethnicity codes were concordant, the patient was assigned that ethnicity. However, if a patient had received two or more discordant ethnicity codes, we selected the modal ethnicity as recorded in their CPRD records. Where there was no modal code, the participant was flagged as having mixed ethnicity. Finally, patients who had no record of ethnicity codes were categorised as \u2018unknown.\u2019\nFor those registered to English practices, we included 10 sub-national geographic regions: North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, London, South West, and South East. We included area-level socioeconomic deprivation using quintiles of the index of multiple deprivation: quintile 1 (low deprivation) to quintile 5 (high deprivation), measured at the practice level.\nWe used the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) to assess physical comorbidities present before the diagnosis of CMD. The CCI is calculated based on the number of physical comorbid conditions assigned an integer weight from one to six, with six representing the most severe morbidity burden (Charlson, Pompei, Ales, & MacKenzie, Reference Charlson, Pompei, Ales and MacKenzie1987). The total CCI score was calculated as the sum of these points, which we categorised into three levels: 0, 1, and 2 or more. Comorbidities were considered to be cumulative over the follow-up period. For example, a patient experiencing a myocardial infarction in 2004 (1 point) would be assigned a CCI score of 1 for the rest of the study period, which would be increased if there was a record of any further comorbidities. If this patient went on to develop localised cancer in 2007 (2 points), their CCI score would be 3 from 2007. If there was no record of physical comorbidities in the patient record, we assumed there were no comorbidities present.\nStatistical analysis\nParticipants were entered into the cohort at the start of follow-up (1 January 2000), their 16th birthday, or registration at an eligible GP practice, if later than the start of follow-up. We split the records using the Lexis expansion to calculate the annual incidence rates (IRs), and time-varying covariates were calculated after the expansion. As patients were re-entered into the cohort following 365 days without receiving a code for CMD, we assumed multiple ordered failure events with discontinuous risk intervals. We calculated the annual incidence of recorded CMDs (per 1000 person-years at risk) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Annual IRs per 1000 person-years at risk were stratified for all covariates. Analysis was conducted using Stata v.17.\nSensitivity analysis\nWe conducted a sensitivity analysis to explore incidence by type: recorded diagnosis/symptom of CMD or pharmaceutical treatment of CMD with antidepressants or anxiolytics. When comparing outcomes ascertained via diagnosis/symptom v. prescription, the two outcomes were considered independently, so individuals could contribute to incidence counts of both outcomes if they had received both diagnoses and prescription in that calendar year.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nThe analytic sample included 29 480 164 participants from 2248 general practices across the United Kingdom, accounting for 237 123 186 person-years, with a mean follow-up time of 12.5 years [standard deviation (s.d.): 6.4 years]. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics of the study sample in 2000, 2010, and 2020.\nThere were similar proportions of females and males at all time points (e.g. females comprising 50.5% of the sample in 2000, 50.8% in 2010, and 50.5% in 2020). The mean age increased over the study period, from 46.8 (s.d. 18.7) to 51.8 (s.d. 17.9). In 2000, 68.5% of the sample did not have a recording of ethnicity, which decreased to 42.4% in 2010 and 31.6% in 2020. Of those with recorded ethnicity, the largest ethnic group was White ethnicity (2000\u201328.5%, 2010\u201348.2%, and 2020\u201354.3%) followed by Asian ethnicity (1.6, 4.9, and 7.4%, respectively). The proportion of the sample from each of the devolved nations remained relatively stable over time, between 83.3% and 84.7% from England, 8.0\u20139.0% from Northern Ireland, 5.2\u20135.8% from Wales, and 1.8\u20132.0% from Scotland.\nWithin England, the South East was the most common region of residence in 2000 and 2010, accounting for 17.3% and 17.8% of the English population, respectively. In 2020, London was the largest region (18.5%) with the South East retaining a large proportion of participants (17.6%). In 2000, the level of deprivation was higher than expected with 23.0% and 24.6% in the highest two quintiles of deprivation with lower proportions (16.1% and 17.4%) in the least deprived quintiles. This persisted through the follow-up time, with 23.6% and 22.8% in the most deprived quintiles in 2020.\nThere were large changes in proportions with physical comorbid conditions over the study period. In 2000, 3.1% had one comorbid condition and 1.7% had two or more. By 2020, this increased to 11.2% with one comorbidity and 13.6% with multiple comorbid conditions.\nIncidence rates\nThe overall IR for any newly recorded episode of CMD was 55.9 per 1000 person-years in 2000 (95% CI 55.8\u201356.1), and it increased over time until 2019 (IR 79.6, 95% CI 79.5\u201379.8), followed by a slight decline in 2020 (IR 76.9, 95% CI 76.8\u201377.1) (Fig. 1; online Supplementary Appendix 2). We noted an increase between 2005 and 2006, with overall incidence increasing from 63.6 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 63.5\u201363.8) to 72.5 (95% CI 72.4\u201372.7).\nIRs were substantially higher among females than males across the study period, with broadly parallel trends over time in females and males (Fig. 2).\nWe observed large differences in the IR of recorded episodes of CMDs over time by age. We found evidence for increasing incidence in all age groups in the first decade of follow-up (2000\u20132010), but differing patterns from 2011 onwards, with incidence continuing to increase in the youngest age groups, but stable in those aged 35\u201354 years, and decreasing rates in those aged \u226555 years. There was a steep increase in the annual incidence of CMD among those aged 16\u201324 years, more than doubling from 40.2 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 39.8\u201340.5) in 2000 to 107.8 (95% CI 107.0\u2013108.6) in 2019. The IR also increased in those aged 25\u201334 years over the same period, but the increase was not as pronounced (2000: 57.0, 95% CI 56.7\u201357.4; 2019: 90.7, 95% CI 90.2\u201391.2). In contrast, the IR in those aged 34\u201344 years remained stable between 78.5 and 81.4 per 1000 person-years from 2010 to 2020. The incidence decreased in all age groups 55 or older after 2010. Those aged \u226575 years, for example, had an IR of 88.1 per 1000 person-years (87.5\u201388.6) in 2011 and 74.3 per 1000 (95% CI 73.9\u201374.8) in 2019 (Fig. 3).\nWe found distinct patterns of incident episodes of recorded CMD by ethnic group. IRs in Asian groups were stable for much of the study period, but we found a large increase in 2016 (IR 62.5, 95% CI 61.9\u201363.1) to 2018 (74.3, 95% CI 73.7\u201375.0). For the Black ethnic group, we observed that the recorded incidence of CMD increased over the study period, from 52.9 per 1000 (95% CI 51.4\u201354.3) in 2000 to 83.0 per 1000 (95% CI 82.1\u201384.0) in 2019, with much of this increase occurring between 2016 and 2019. In the mixed ethnicity group, we observed an increase in recorded incidence from 2000 (65.6 per 1000, 95% CI 63.0\u201368.2) to 2003 (82.0 per 1000, 95% CI 79.5\u201384.5), but remained stable through the later study period. There was an increase in recorded CMD for the White ethnic group between 2005 and 2006, followed by stable rates through 2012 and declining rates after 2013 (Fig. 4).\nFor all nations, there was evidence of increasing IRs from the beginning of the study (2000\u20132004), including increased recorded incidence between 2005 and 2006 (Fig. 5). In Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, there was relative stability between 2007 and 2012, with decreasing rates after 2013. In contrast, the incidence increased in England over the same time. All nations saw a decrease in recorded incidence in 2020 compared to 2019.\nWithin England, the level of incidence of CMD varied across sub-national regions, with London showing consistently lower incidence (from 47.0, 95% CI 46.7\u201374.4 in 2000 to 73.2, 95% CI 72.8\u201373.6 in 2019) than all other regions. In contrast, the North East had elevated rates across the study period, ranging from 62.5 per 1000 (95% CI 61.6\u201363.4) in 2000 to 92.3 (95% CI 91.1\u201393.5) in 2019. Despite these differences, the temporal pattern was similar across the regions: increasing incidence from 2000 to 2004, a notable increase between 2005 and 2006, followed by a decrease in 2008, and a further decrease in 2020 (Fig. 6).\nWhen exploring patterns by deprivation (England only), we found evidence of a dose\u2013response relationship between the recorded incidence of CMD and deprivation quintile, with lower rates of CMD in areas with lower levels of deprivation and higher rates of incidence of CMD in higher quintiles of deprivation (Fig. 7). There appeared to be a divergence in the IRs between deprivation quintile over time, with steeper increases in the most deprived quintiles when compared to less deprived areas. In 2000, the incidence in the lowest quintile was 55.4 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 55.1\u201355.8), which increased to 71.7 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 72.3\u201373.1) in 2010 and 74.8 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 74.4\u201375.2) in 2019. The recorded IR in the most deprived quintile was 57.8 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 57.9\u201358.1) in 2000 increasing to 85.4 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 83.1\u201383.8) in 2010 and 85.9 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 85.6\u201386.3) in 2019.\nThere were marked differences in IR of CMD episodes by comorbidity score (CCI), including much higher rates of CMD in those with higher CCI scores. In 2000, those without comorbidities had an incidence of 54.0 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 53.9\u201354.1), those with a CCI score of 1 had an IR of 78.9 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 78.0\u201379.9), and those with a score of 2 or more had an IR of 123.2 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 121.6\u2013124.8; Fig. 8). Visual inspection suggested that these rates were converging over time due to increased incidence in the group without comorbidities and decreased incidence in the group with the highest comorbidity burden, although we did not test for a statistical interaction with comorbidity score and time.\nIn our sensitivity analysis, we divided the incidence of CMD by type to compare IRs of those who had new episodes of CMD due to recorded symptoms or diagnosis included in their records, compared to those who were considered incidence cases due to receipt of prescriptions to treat CMD (e.g. antidepressants or anxiolytics). At the start of the study, nearly twice the number of incidence cases were due to prescriptions than recorded symptoms/diagnosis (49.6 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 49.4\u201349.7; 25.5 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 25.5\u201325.6; respectively). Over time, the IR of recorded CMD episodes due to prescribing increased from 2000 (49.6 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 49.4\u201349.7) until 2014 (63.5, 95% CI 63.3\u201363.6), and with a slight decrease until 2019 (58.5 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 58.3\u201358.6). There was a larger increase in incidence cases due to recorded diagnoses or symptoms, more than doubling from 25.5 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 25.5\u201325.6) in 2000 to 68.5 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 68.3\u201368.7) in 2019. The pattern was markedly different by type between 2019 and 2020. In 2020, compared to rates in 2019, the IR in 2020 increased for prescriptions (61.2 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 61.0\u201361.3) and decreased for recorded symptoms or diagnoses (62.0 per 1000 person-year, 95% CI 61.8\u201362.2; Fig. 9).\nDiscussion\nWe observed an increasing incidence of recorded CMDs in the United Kingdom over the past 20 years, with important differences by population group. Much of this increase was observed before 2005, with stable rates from 2006 to 2019 and a decrease in 2020. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find clear evidence linking the temporal trends of recorded CMD incidence to the 2007\u201308 financial crisis and subsequent austerity measures.\nPossible explanations for the observed increase in recorded CMD incidence include (1) a genuine rise in anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms; (2) changes in help-seeking behaviours, including increased rates of consulting with GPs for mental health concerns; or (3) changes in diagnosing, prescribing, and recording mental health symptoms and diagnoses in general practice. Firstly, the increased incidence of recorded CMD may reflect a true increase in CMD symptoms. Recent research has noted increasing levels of psychological distress, supporting this explanation (Daly, Reference Daly2022; Daly & Macchia, Reference Daly and Macchia2023). Secondly, the increased incidence of CMD recorded in primary care may reflect changing public attitudes towards discussing mental health problems and a growing willingness to seek help. Anti-stigma programmes and mental health awareness campaigns may have contributed to higher mental health literacy, and lower levels of stigma, which may reduce barriers to seeking care (Bonabi et al., Reference Bonabi, M\u00fcller, Ajdacic-Gross, Eisele, Rodgers, Seifritz and R\u00fcsch2016; Clement et al., Reference Clement, Schauman, Graham, Maggioni, Evans-Lacko, Bezborodovs and Thornicroft2015; Sampogna et al., Reference Sampogna, Bakolis, Evans-Lacko, Robinson, Thornicroft and Henderson2017; Schnyder, Panczak, Groth, & Schultze-Lutter, Reference Schnyder, Panczak, Groth and Schultze-Lutter2017). The different patterns we observed by age may be linked to generational shifts in mental health stigma, including lower levels of stigma observed in younger age groups and more recent birth cohorts (Evans-Lacko, Corker, Williams, Henderson, & Thornicroft, Reference Evans-Lacko, Corker, Williams, Henderson and Thornicroft2014). Thirdly, changing diagnostic practices within primary care could have contributed to the observed trends. The introduction of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) in 2006, which provided financial incentives for physicians to deliver and document evidence-based care, may have increased the recording of CMD symptoms and diagnoses during that period (McLintock et al., Reference McLintock, Russell, Alderson, West, House, Westerman and Foy2014). The decline in recorded CMD incidence from 2019 to 2020 provides further support to the second and third explanations. While it is unlikely that the observed decrease reflected an actual reduction of CMD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in patient help-seeking behaviour, including the inability or reluctance to access mental health care during the wider public health crisis, could partially account for the decrease. This is consistent with previous research, which shows a considerable reduction in primary care-recorded CMDs during the first 6 months of the pandemic, a period of high demand on the healthcare system (Carr et al., Reference Carr, Steeg, Webb, Kapur, Chew-Graham, Abel and Ashcroft2021). In addition, many GPs radically changed their working patterns during the pandemic, including shifting to remote patient consultations while navigating high levels of pressure on the healthcare system, which may have resulted in fewer recorded symptoms and increased use of pharmacological treatment (Murphy et al., Reference Murphy, Scott, Salisbury, Turner, Scott, Denholm and Horwood2021). While all three explanations may contribute to the overall trend, our study was not able to elucidate the underlying mechanism for these changes.\nComparison to previous research\nOur study adds to the existing CMD literature by producing annual estimates over a 20-year period and providing detailed estimates stratified by key sociodemographic factors, which have not been explored in previous research. Our IRs were higher than previous estimates using UK primary care data. This discrepancy can be attributed, in part, to our inclusive case definition of CMD, which included anxiety, depression, and stress-related diagnoses, symptoms, and pharmaceutical treatment. A study on recorded diagnoses and symptoms of anxiety and depression in Wales found a lower IR (20.3 per 1000 person-years in 2000) with evidence of increasing IRs from 2000 to 2006 (John et al., Reference John, McGregor, Fone, Dunstan, Cornish, Lyons and Lloyd2016). Our estimates of recorded incidence for symptoms and diagnosis only revealed similar estimates (25.5 per 1000 person-years in 2000) with an increasing trend in the first decade of follow-up. Other studies examined anxiety and depressive disorders separately. One study estimated that in 2000 the incidence of diagnosed depression was 18.1 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 17.8\u201318.3) and the incidence of depressive symptoms was 8.72 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 8.6\u20138.9) (Rait et al., Reference Rait, Walters, Griffin, Buszewicz, Petersen and Nazareth2009). Another study estimated that the incidence of anxiety diagnoses and symptoms was 7.2 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 7.0\u20137.3) in 2000 (Walters, Rait, Griffin, Buszewicz, & Nazareth, Reference Walters, Rait, Griffin, Buszewicz and Nazareth2012). While the magnitude of incidence estimates was lower than our study, these studies also found similar patterns across sex and deprivation.\nThese overall trends obfuscated differences between population groups, particularly the notable differences by age. Individuals aged 16\u201324 years had the lowest IR in 2000 but experienced a more than twofold increase by 2019. A smaller increase was also observed among those aged 20\u201334 years. Conversely, older age groups had higher IRs in 2000, followed by stable or decreasing rates after 2011. This rising incidence among young people aligns with previous research, which found an increase in anxiety from 2003 to 2018 (Archer, Turner, Kessler, Mars, & Wiles, Reference Archer, Turner, Kessler, Mars and Wiles2022; Cybulski et al., Reference Cybulski, Ashcroft, Carr, Garg, Chew-Graham, Kapur and Webb2021). These divergent trends across age groups may reflect changes in help-seeking behaviours, with younger people being more willing to discuss mental health problems than older individuals. While there may be temporal changes in diagnostic practices, we do not expect that these changes would be more pronounced for older or younger ages, suggesting that they are unlikely to fully explain the observed trends.\nDifferences in CMD incidence were observed by ethnic group. In 2000, the overall rate of recorded CMD incidence was highest among individuals from White, mixed, and other ethnic groups. The rate remained elevated in White and mixed ethnic groups throughout the study period, with a decrease observed in the White ethnic group from 2011 to 2020. Conversely, an increasing CMD incidence was found in Black and Asian ethnic groups between 2016 and 2019. It is important to note that these results are based on recorded diagnosis and treatment of CMD, and the broader picture is nuanced. Lower rates of recorded CMD do not mean that there are lower rates of clinically relevant CMD symptoms in Black and Asian ethnic groups but may be more indicative of the well-documented barriers to mental health care for minoritised groups (Bansal et al., Reference Bansal, Karlsen, Sashidharan, Cohen, Chew-Graham and Malpass2022; Cooper et al., Reference Cooper, Spiers, Livingston, Jenkins, Meltzer, Brugha and Bebbington2013; Le Cook, Trinh, Li, Hou, & Progovac, Reference Le Cook, Trinh, Li, Hou and Progovac2017; Memon et al., Reference Memon, Taylor, Mohebati, Sundin, Cooper, Scanlon and De Visser2016; Nwokoroku, Neil, Dlamini, & Osuchukwu, Reference Nwokoroku, Neil, Dlamini and Osuchukwu2022). However, caution is needed when interpreting these results due to changes in the accuracy and completeness of ethnicity recorded in primary care (Mathur et al., Reference Mathur, Bhaskaran, Chaturvedi, Leon, Vanstaa, Grundy and Smeeth2013; Shiekh et al., Reference Shiekh, Harley, Ghosh, Ashworth, Myles, Booth and Axson2023). Ethnicity was not stated or not known for a substantial proportion of the sample in 2000 (68.5%). While recording improved by 2020, ethnicity was still missing for 31.6% of our sample. Further, while the number of missing data has decreased, the proportion of patient records marked as \u2018not known\u2019 or \u2018not stated\u2019 has increased, which may introduce bias if minoritised ethnic groups are systematically excluded from health statistics.\nThe overall increase in incidence over time was driven by the rates in England, as 85% of the sample was from England. In the other three nations, IRs were stable between 2007 and 2012, followed by a decrease. Variations in healthcare policies and priorities between the devolved nations may explain these differences over time. In England, the North East and North West consistently had higher CMD rates than other regions, while London had the lowest incidence. Incidence of CMD showed a dose\u2013response relationship with deprivation quintile, where areas with low deprivation had lower CMD levels, and vice versa. The disparity between the highest and lowest fifths of deprivation appeared to be widening over time, but no statistical test was conducted to confirm this trend.\nThere was also a dose\u2013response relationship between comorbidity and CMD, with high IRs in those with high comorbidity scores. These differences were more pronounced at the start of the study, suggesting a convergence over time, with decreasing rates in those with high comorbidity scores and increasing rates in those with low comorbidity scores. This convergence might be linked to the growing proportion of people who have longstanding illnesses, which corresponded to a 10-fold increase in the proportion of people with chronic illnesses in their primary care records in the past 20 years. Further investigation is needed to explore if these increased comorbidity rates are due to improved linkages among primary, secondary, and tertiary care records or a changing burden of chronic disease across the aging population of the United Kingdom.\nFrom 2000 to 2017, psychotropic prescribing accounted for more incident CMD episodes than recorded symptoms or diagnoses, underscoring the importance of including prescribing information in an inclusive case definition of CMD. The overall increase in CMD incidence was driven by increasing rates of physician-recorded symptoms and diagnoses over the study period, while prescribing rates remained stable. This contradicts evidence of increased psychotropic prescribing in recent decades (Bogowicz et al., Reference Bogowicz, Curtis, Walker, Cowen, Geddes and Goldacre2021; Lockhart & Guthrie, Reference Lockhart and Guthrie2011). Yet, these findings are supported by research which shows that higher antidepressant prescribing rates may be the result of more long-term use of these medications, rather than incident prescriptions (Lockhart & Guthrie, Reference Lockhart and Guthrie2011; Mars et al., Reference Mars, Heron, Kessler, Davies, Martin, Thomas and Gunnell2017; Moore et al., Reference Moore, Yuen, Dunn, Mullee, Maskell and Kendrick2009).\nLimitations\nIt is important to reflect on the limitations associated with using EHR data for this analysis. First, we do not have a true population denominator for these estimates, as this cohort includes only those registered to a GP who access care, excluding individuals who are not registered with a GP (e.g. institutionalised individuals). While most UK residents are registered with a GP, accurately establishing the population denominator continues to pose a challenge as there are individuals who infrequently access healthcare (Cocoros, Ochoa, Eberhardt, Zambarano, & Klompas, Reference Cocoros, Ochoa, Eberhardt, Zambarano and Klompas2019). The analysis assumes that individuals without a GP record did not require mental health care during that year, which overlooks the well-documented barriers that vulnerable and marginalised groups encounter, leading to potential underestimation of population rates of CMD. Further, EHR data are collected for clinical, not research, purposes. While there were quality checks for data accuracy, regular audits of coding practices are not conducted, potentially affecting the accuracy of recorded symptoms, diagnoses, and prescriptions. Changing coding practices over the 20-year study period, especially with the introduction of QOF incentives, could have partially explained the observed results. Symptoms and diagnoses may be coded in the free text sections of the patient record, which would underestimate the true rates of CMD, as the free text was not analysed.\nThese results should be interpreted within the broader landscape of mental health care provisions in the United Kingdom over time. Notably, the introduction of the \u2018Improving Access to Psychological Therapies\u2019 (IAPT) initiative in England in 2007 has implications. As IAPT data were not linked to CPRD, we would miss any individuals who received CMD care through IAPT if they had not also discussed their symptoms with their GP. While IAPT has not been adopted by the other devolved nations, they have other mental health initiatives which may provide mental health support outside of general practice. Analytically, this study provided a descriptive look into temporal trends of CMD, but we generated unconditional IRs or rates conditioned on a single variable. Further research could explore these patterns in a multivariate framework.\nStrengths\nThis study benefits from a 20-year follow-up, an inclusive case definition, and stratum-specific estimates, providing a detailed exploration of temporal trends in recorded CMD incidence. This study includes more than 29 million participants, broadly representative of the UK population as more than 98% of the population is registered with a GP. Despite the limitations of EHR data, they provide an accurate and useful estimate of clinical demand and service provision. Our study employed a broad case definition for CMD, encompassing the shared psychopathology, high comorbidity, and diagnostic overlap between anxiety and depressive disorders (Kessler et al., Reference Kessler, Gruber, Hettema, Hwang, Sampson and Yonkers2008; Zbozinek et al., Reference Zbozinek, Rose, Wolitzky-Taylor, Sherbourne, Sullivan, Stein and Craske2012). This definition accommodates pragmatic behaviours in primary care, such as coding symptoms of mental health issues that do not use diagnostic thresholds or using non-specific codes (e.g. stress-related problems) instead of specific diagnostic categories to capture the broad range of patients presenting to primary care for CMD.\nConclusions\nThe incidence of CMDs recorded in primary care in the United Kingdom increased over the last two decades. While the overall incidence increased over the study period, much of the increase was observed between 2000 and 2006, with relatively stable overall rates after that point. These overall findings obfuscated important differences across demographic characteristics, which may have implications for the identification, assessment, and treatment of CMD across the population. Specifically, the notable rise in CMD incidence among adolescents and young adults over the last 20 years demands further investigation and public health action.\nSupplementary material\nThe supplementary material for this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291723002349\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors were supported by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) School for Public Health Research (SPHR) (PD-SPH-2015).

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses the concerning decline in personality traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion among younger Americans, particularly those aged 16-39, from 2014 to 2022, while neuroticism has increased. This shift is attributed to factors like the pervasive influence of smartphones, the pandemic, and rising economic inequality. The author suggests that these changes may not represent a permanent decline in character but rather an adaptation to a rapidly changing world, emphasizing the need for nurturing positive traits through intentional practices.",
