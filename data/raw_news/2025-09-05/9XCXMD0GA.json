  "content": "is a senior reporter who\u2019s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nAvailable now for $349 in navy blue and sandy gold color options, the earbuds are a more affordable alternative to the company\u2019s $449 over-the-ear W4 Pro released earlier this year that looked like the clunky Bluetooth headsets that were popular a few decades ago. Timekettle says its new W4 AI are instead \u201coptimized for casual use\u201d with a design that looks more like modern wireless earbuds, but with a much larger stem.\n\nThe reason the W4 AI aren\u2019t as compact as other wireless earbuds like Apple\u2019s AirPods is because they contain additional electronics to run Timekettle\u2019s Babel OS 2.0 real-time translation software that\u2019s powered by AI LLM models. The company says the system \u201cinstantly converts speech between 42 languages and 95 accents\u201d with up to 98 percent accuracy thanks to its ability to understand and anticipate the context of what you\u2019re saying so it can differentiate between similar sounding words. As with the W4 Pro, you can also create your own custom lexicon for the new W4 AI so it doesn\u2019t get confused when talking to someone about skibidi toilets.\n\nTo further improve its translation accuracy the W4 AI includes a new feature not seen on Timekettle\u2019s other products. The earbuds use a combination of a standard microphone and a sensor that detects voice vibrations through the bones in your head to more accurately recognize what you\u2019re saying, even in loud environments. The bone conduction sensor also improves sensitivity so you can talk quieter, potentially allowing for more discreet conversations when talking in public.\n\nBattery life is rated at up to four hours of continuous translation or up to 10 hours when paired with the W4 AI\u2019s charging case that splits in two with an earbud on either side. They can also be used as standard wireless earbuds when you just want to listen to music which boosts battery life to up to eight hours, or 18 with a top-off in their charging case.\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",

      "text": "Okay, Gen Z. Sit down, babes. It\u2019s time to talk.\nHey Gen Z, I promise you aren\u2019t aging like milk\nLet\u2019s talk about your quarter-life crisis.\nLet\u2019s talk about your quarter-life crisis.\nI have seen multiple reports that you are worried about whether you are \u201caging like milk.\u201d (I guess this is a thing on TikTok, an app I am too old to care about.) Like, yes, I think it is extremely funny to tease you, but also, generally, I like you guys and am kind of worried about how neurotic you are making yourselves. It is \u2014 to borrow a phrase \u2014 time to stop, drop, and roll yourself back to sanity.\nDo you know how many times since my 40th birthday I have uttered the magic words: \u201cI am 40. I don\u2019t have to care about this\u201d?\nI am not interested in the question of whether you are aging faster than millennials. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re scared of looking old. I think you\u2019re scared of being old. Here\u2019s a little secret: it fucking rules.\nI know advertisers won\u2019t tell you that. They want you buying fountain-of-youth serums and panicking like a dang 10-year-old. And you can do that, if you want, sure. It\u2019s expensive and will keep you from spending money on other things. (The heart wants what it wants, I get it! But money is, for most of us, finite.)\nWhich is why I am trying to tell you that aging is great.\nListen, I know the Skibidi Toilet thing upset a bunch of you. Take a deep breath, my loves. You do not have to understand what the children are doing! Children have fundamentally different priorities than you, and you can simply be bemused by whatever they are up to. Maybe you can think a little bit about what you were doing at that age and chuckle to yourself. Me? I thought protesting the Iraq War would matter and that crop tops were a good idea.\nPart of what you\u2019re up to now is the discovery process\nDo you know how many times since my 40th birthday I have uttered the magic words: \u201cI am 40. I don\u2019t have to care about this\u201d? It is so freeing. Being cool and trendy, which can seem all-consuming in your teens and 20s, is exhausting. It steals your energy away from the things that actually matter, and one of the best parts of aging is that you know what actually matters. I always hated it when someone older than me told me I\u2019d understand when I was older \u2014 I found it condescending \u2014 but sadly, that\u2019s just how some things are. You\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re older.\nI\u2019m not saying that to make you feel bad. Part of what you\u2019re up to now is the discovery process. You don\u2019t know what matters yet, everything is kind of fresh and overwhelming, and also, you can still do stuff like pull all-nighters. (You\u2019ll hit a wall with all-nighters around the age of 27.) Your hangovers haven\u2019t gotten bad yet. You can drive all day and your back won\u2019t hurt! Enjoy that stuff, kiddos. It\u2019s gonna change.\nOne of the things I have observed about you is that you are internet-addled in a profoundly different way than I am. I grew up on the text-based internet; when I first got online, images were rare because they took so long to load. Streaming video wasn\u2019t a widespread thing until I was in college. Social media in its current form didn\u2019t exist until then, either. I say all this because it means I have almost certainly spent a lot less time staring at my own face than you have; I have also spent less time judging others on their appearance and being judged by my appearance. I\u2019m a writer. I get to look like whatever I fucking want as long as the sentences are good.\nTurn off the self-view on video conferencing apps. I promise it will help.\nThere was one other way that era of the internet shaped me: most people who were also online were older than me. (It was hard to get a decent internet connection in the \u201990s unless you had access to a college campus, as I did.) Youth culture took place mostly offline \u2014 a lot of millennial shit is lost to the sands of time because the coolest of us had not yet logged on.\nSo here\u2019s my first tip about surviving the aging process: Turn off the self-view on video conferencing apps. I promise it will help.\nHere\u2019s my second tip: make older friends. You\u2019ll probably have to put your phone down for that \u2014 which will help with the havoc TikTok is wreaking on your psyche. Just go somewhere a lot: a coffee shop, a yoga studio, a climbing gym. Volunteer at a food kitchen or an animal shelter. It can be anything, really; pick a third place. If you go to a physical place often enough and just start talking to strangers, you will eventually make friends. The secret trick is just to treat people like they\u2019re already your friend, and then, often, they will actually want to be your friend.\nOlder friends show you what your future looks like, but they also show you what aging looks like. You start to see stuff you can\u2019t see on Instagram \u2014 like that your friend\u2019s crow\u2019s feet come from the way their eyes crinkle when they laugh. That those lines are often evidence of joy, of a life well-lived. After a while, you take the fondness you feel for others and start to apply it to your own gray hairs. Because you know what\u2019s made out of aged milk? Cheese.\nI don\u2019t think I have to tell you that cheese is delicious.\nIf you are intimidated by making older friends in the real world, you can start by seeking us out online\nYou can find olds online, too, although we\u2019re not necessarily congregating in the same places you are. Bluesky, for instance, is possibly the most 30- or 40-year-old place on the internet. So if you are intimidated by making older friends in the real world, you can start there. Because we\u2019re all still online! It\u2019s just that what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t going to panic anyone\u2019s parents, and so internet culture reporters ignore us. (Also, advertisers care about us less because our spending habits are less malleable.) Sure, children are the future, but adults are also the future because the future is unevenly distributed, hello.\nAnd though there are a lot of memes about generational warfare or whatever, that\u2019s not really how things work offline. TikTok is not at all representative! And if you guys are any guide, Gen Alpha\u2019s bravado is cover for being insecure and terrified. So be nice to them \u2014 it\u2019s bad form to pick on the children when what they really need is a little patience.\nI can personally report, for instance, that it\u2019s been tremendously funny to watch you all adopt the fashions of my late teens and early 20s and call it \u201cindie sleaze\u201d because I guess you don\u2019t know what hipsters are? By the way, the reason we were all wearing American Apparel was that we were broke, and they did not prosecute shoplifters. There\u2019s a whole book about it. Our eyeliner was like that because there were no readily available YouTube makeup tutorials, so we just bought some cheap Wet n Wild liner, used our lighters to heat up the pencil, and then smeared it around our eyes before it cooled down and set. (We had lighters because a lot more of us smoked.)\nThe other thing I\u2019ll tell you, which you may already know, is that aging is a privilege. I\u2019ve lost a lot of people I loved over the years. They never got the chance to worry about wrinkles. The luckiest among us are going to be old for a very long time.\nAnyway, if you\u2019ve made it this far and are still scared about looking old, I do have some final advice: that center part is absolutely aging you. Faces lengthen as we age, and gravity pulls your skin downward. (You can, if you like, choose to associate that with sophistication or elegance; I do, anyway.) A straight center part, particularly without layers, is going to make your face look longer. You might consider a side part or bangs. I think those are the only two things we millennials have got on you.\nMost Popular\n- The Browser Company, maker of Arc and Dia, is being acquired\n- Microsoft is about to shake up its Copilot pricing for businesses\n- Philips Hue lights get bigger, brighter, and cheaper with a major product refresh\n- How Wikipedia survives while the rest of the internet breaks\n- Inside Philips Hue\u2019s plans to make all your lights motion sensors"
