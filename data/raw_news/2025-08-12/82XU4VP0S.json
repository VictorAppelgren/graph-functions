Especially because welcoming a new human into the world also includes purchasing endless outfits, diapers, securing the right playpen and understanding what food is right for your child \u2014 among many other things.\n- Best Double Stroller: UPPAbaby G-LINK 2 Double Stroller\n- Best Collapsable Wagon Stroller: Veer Wagon Cruiser\n- Best Jogging Stroller: BOB Gear Revolution Flex 3.0 Jogging Stroller\n- Best Stroller for Newborns and Toddlers: Peg Perego Ypsi Travel System\n- Best Stroller For All Terrains: Thule Urban Glide 2 All-Terrain & Jogging Stroller\nTo aid in your stroller shopping journey, we reached out to three parenting experts \u2014 top mommy influencers Katie Stauffer and Ssonia Ong, as well as the founder of Mothership NYC, Miranda Padilla. The shopping team has also tested some top strollers firsthand and included some of our picks below.\nWhat are the different types of strollers?\nThere is a wide variety of strollers for every lifestyle. One of the most popular builds is the classic, canopy stroller which offers a shield to protect little ones from sun or rain. Newer models offer both front-facing and backward-facing strollers, as well as strollers that can convert into car seats and recline into bassinets \u2014 ideal for frequent travelers. Larger families should consider stackable or double strollers. Joggers may want to splurge on a lightweight, running stroller.\nHeading to a baby shower? Don\u2019t forget to check out our best baby gifts roundup.\nShop this article by category: Best Strollers of 2025\n- Stauffer\u2019s Stroller Picks | Padilla\u2019s Stroller Picks | Ong\u2019s Stroller Picks | New York Post Stroller Picks\nStauffer\u2019s Stroller Picks\nBest Double Stroller: UPPAbaby G-LINK 2 Double Stroller\nPros:\n- An affordable option for a two-seater\n- Multi-paneled canopies with extendable UPF 50+ sunshades\n- Seats recline\nCons:\n- A bit wider than the stackable option\n- Some reviewers say maneuvering in narrow places is a bit difficult\n\u201cI loved the G-Link 2 when the girls were younger,\u201d said Stauffer. \u201cIt folds up so easily [and] it\u2019s great for travel.\u201d\nWith two independent reclining seats and adjustable sunshades, this is one of the best double strollers on the market. Further features include a lightweight aluminum frame, multi-paneled canopies, four sets of wheels, quick folding, carry handles, an easy-access basket and more. Suitable for babies three months and up.\nSpecs: 27.5 X 28.5 X 42 inches | Weight: 22.3 pounds | Weight capacity: 55 pounds per seat | Tire type: n/a\nBest Collapsable Wagon Stroller: Veer Wagon Cruiser\nPros:\n- Great for the outdoors\n- Can seat multiple kids (cargo capacity is 300 pounds)\n- Passenger harnesses for safety\nCons:\n- Better for toddlers and bigger kids\n- On the heavier side\n\u201cWe loved, loved, loved the Veer,\u201d Stauffer shared with The Post. \u201cIt was great because they had a lot of freedom and they sat facing each other.\u201d\nFeaturing adjustable handle height, an expanding footwell, passenger harnesses, a one-touch foot break and more, this wagon is loved by many. The best part about it? This wagon is completely collapsable, so it can be stored easily and won\u2019t take up your precious space.\nDimensions: 37 X 20 X 23 Inches | Weight: 32 pounds | Weight capacity: 110 Pounds | Tire type: Rubber airless tread\nBest Jogging Stroller: BOB Gear Revolution Flex 3.0 Jogging Stroller\nPros:\n- Great for running \u2014 turns easily\n- Six storage pockets\n- Compatible with most major brand car seats\nCons:\n- More expensive\n- On the heavier side\nBack in Stauffer\u2019s running days, this was her go-to stroller. \u201cI think everyone agrees this is the best jogging stroller,\u201d she said.\nWe can see why, as the stroller provides a smooth ride over any terrain, the adjustable handlebar creates the perfect height for all parents and the ultra-padded compression seat keeps your kiddo comfortable all day.\nDimensions: 46 X 25 X 45 inches | Weight: 28.5 pounds | Weight capacity: 75 pounds | Tire type: Pneumatic | Special features: Adjustable handlebars\nBest Stroller for Newborns and Toddlers: Peg Perego Ypsi Travel System\nPros:\n- Travel system \u2014 functions as both stroller and car seat\n- Companion seats are sold separately\n- Lightweight\nCons:\n- More expensive\n\u201cThis was the OG nice stroller back in the day and they\u2019ve come out with a lot of really great strollers recently,\u201d Stauffer told us. \u201cIt was a brand I always trusted, and I loved that everything was designed in Italy.\u201d\nWe are on the same page, especially with the Peg Perego Ypsi Travel System. The system includes the Ypsi Stroller and the Primo Viaggio 4-35 Nido Infant car seat. Best of all, it seamlessly converts to a double stroller when needed and desired.\nDimensions 9.25 X 40.75 X 40.24 inches | Weight: 22.6 pounds | Weight capacity: 35 pounds | Tire type: Rubber\nBest Stroller for Runners: Thule Urban Glide 2 All-Terrain & Jogging Stroller\nPros:\n- Affordable\n- Great for outdoors\n- Single and double versions are available\n- Different color options\nCons:\n- Only suitable for 6 months and up\n- Some reviewers say it is difficult to lock the wheels\nStauffer claims that the Thule is \u201canother great stroller for outdoor activities,\u201d and we fully support her suggestion.\nWhile Stauffer had a various Thule stroller model, we love the Thule Urban Glide 2. It\u2019s a lightweight stroller that lets you seamlessly do life with your kiddo. So go ahead. Go an explore with your little one.\nDimensions: 41.1 X 27.2 X 40 inches | Weight: 25.3 pounds | Weight capacity: 75 pounds | Tire type: EVA | Special features: Award-winning\nBest Travel Stroller: Cybex Beezy Stroller\nPros:\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight and foldable\n- Sun canopy with UPF 50+ protection\n- Many color options\nCons:\n- Some reviewers say straps are difficult to adjust\nWhile Stauffer has never used the Cybex herself, she says it looks \u201creally pretty\u201d and we agree.\nBest of all, it includes an and extra large sun canopy with UPF 50+ rating, a peek-a-boo window and a rain cover to create the ultimate stroller umbrella.\nDimensions: 31 X 17 X 40 inches | Weight: 18 pounds | Weight capacity: 55 pounds | Tire type: n/a |\nPadilla\u2019s Stroller Picks\nBest Stoller for Newborns: Doona Infant Car Seat & Latch Base\nPros:\n- Car seat fabric is removable and washable\n- Best for traveling\n- Lightweight and very compact\n- Many color options\nCons:\n- Some reviewers say it works best on smooth pavement \u2014 not ideal for outdoor terrain\nMiranda Padilla created The Mothership NYC, a doula agency in Harlem, to support mothers during pregnancy and the newborn phase. If there is anyone to look to for stroller advice in those early days, it\u2019s her. She loves the Doona because of the convenience. With the touch of a button, the wheels drop down, making the Doona easy to use for those who take Ubers and public transportation often. At just 16.5 pounds, this is a great lightweight option for those always on the go.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great choice for bringing a baby home from the hospital, where car seats are required upon discharge. It is easy for use after a cesarean. It\u2019s convenient for travel, as it transforms from a car seat to a stroller in seconds,\u201d shared Padilla.\nDimensions: 28 X 18 X 20 inches | Weight: 17 pounds | Weight capacity: 35 pounds | Tire type: n/a | Special features: Anti-rebound protection\nBest Lightweight Running Stroller: Joovy Zoom360 Ultralight Jogging Stroller\nPros:\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight and very compact\n- Air pump is included so you can adjust tire pressure on the go\nCons:\n- Some reviewers say storage space is difficult to get to\nThis is the \u201cnumber one jogging stroller,\u201d in Padilla\u2019s opinion. \u201cBabies can sit in it as soon as they are able to hold their heads steady. It is suitable for serious running or everyday use. It is lighter than most other joggers, reclines far enough for a nap, and has a huge storage basket. It weighs 25 pounds.\u201d\nPushing a stroller all day can be exhausting, especially for new parents. Finding a lightweight option like the Joovy will make those outdoor adventures much more pleasurable. At under $300, this is a great deal on an everyday stroller.\nDimensions: 54 X 25 X 46 inches | Weight: 25 pounds | Weight capacity: 75 pounds | Tire type: All-terrain | Special features: Includes tire pump\nBest Forward and Backward Facing Stroller: Mockingbird Single-to-Double Stroller\nPros:\n- Good for larger families\n- Different colors and prints\n- UPF 50+ all-weather canopy\n- The stroller can be folded with one hand\n- Can easily switch between forward-facing and parent-facing modes\nCons:\n- Some reviewers said there was not much shock-absorption (not ideal for difficult terrain)\n\u201cParents can switch the baby seat between forward and backward facing. The Mockingbird can be closed with one hand. It weighs 26.5 pounds,\u201d said Padilla.\nPadilla explained this stroller is especially great for those with a growing family because you can expand the stroller as your family gets bigger. The Mockingbird has over 19 arrangements including add-one\u2019s like an extra seat or riding board for an older child. Kiddos can face each other for entertainment or be turned away for some peace and quiet.\nDimensions: 25.5 X 40 X 33 inches | Weight: 26.5 pounds | Weight capacity: 50 pounds | Tire type: All suspension, shock-absorbing | Special features: Can be adjusted 22 different ways\nBest City Stroller: Uppababy G-Luxe Stroller\nPros:\n- Affordable\n- Very lightweight and narrow\n- Pop-out UPF 50+ sunshade\n- Removable cup holder\nCons:\n- The storage basket underneath is a little snug, per reviews\n\u201cIt weighs 15 pounds and has a carry strap, making it suitable for walk-up apartment dwellers. It easily clicks into a locked, stand-up position when closed, making it a good choice for restaurants, public transportation, or small apartments,\u201d shared Padilla.\nLiving in the city with a new baby is challenging enough, which is why picking out the right stroller is so important. Padilla believes the G-Luxe maneuvers city streets well, has three recline positions, and an extended sun canopy with an SPF visor. That checks of all the bases in our books.\nDimensions: 28.75 X 18.75 X 43 inches | Weight: 15 pounds | Weight capacity: 55 pounds | Tire type: Rubber | Special features: UPF 50+ Sunshade, Storage in the back\nOng\u2019s Stroller Picks\nBest Stroller Wagon with Storage: Wonderfold W4 Multi-Function Quad Stroller\nPros:\n- Holds up to four passengers in removable seats\n- Lots of storage pockets\n- The roof provides shade and cover from rain\nCons:\n- More expensive\n- On the heavier side\n\u201cPerfect for family adventures,\u201d said Ong, who is a children\u2019s mental health counselor and mom to five children. \u201cI love that it is so roomy and can accommodate my kids comfortably, plus all the stuff we need for our outings.\u201d\nWe agree with Ong, as the Wonderfold includes all the space you could ever need. Take it to the beach, an amusement park or just around town. The sun shade allows for comfort while the collapsible push handle is user-friendly. Besides, what\u2019s more adorable than a wagon full of kids?\nDimensions: 33 X 21 X 19 inches | Weight: 50 pounds | Weight capacity: 300 pounds | Tire type: All-weather rubber\nBest Compact Stroller: Bugaboo Butterfly Stoller\nPros:\n- Multiple color options\n- Ultra-compact and foldable\n- Four-panel sun canopy\n- Smart white indicators on the side of the base show when the unfold is done safely and ready to stroll\nCons:\n- Designed to be used from the time your child can sit up (around 6 months)\n- Some reviewers say storage space is tricky to get to\n\u201cI love that this fits in the overhead bins on an airplane! So great for travel! Slim but functional. Really easy to drive and tons of storage underneath\u201d shared Ong.\nOne hand, one second, one movement, that\u2019s all. That is the promise Bugaboo lives by, and that is likely why it\u2019s become such a popular choice. The stroller can fold in a blink with only one hand. You could be holding the baby in the other. The ultimate convenience for busy parents.\nDimensions: 40.31 X 17.72 X 36.42 inches | Weight: 16.1 pounds | Weight capacity: 48.5 pounds | Tire type: flat-free EVA foam\nNew York Post Stroller Picks\nBest Stroller with Carseat: Chicco Bravo Trio Travel System\nPros:\n- Ample storage beneath the stroller for toys, a diaper bag and other necessities\n- Car seat easily locks into place within the stroller \u2014 very intuitive design\n- Double cup holders for your child\u2019s sippy cups\nCons:\n- Not the easiest to drive with one hand, according to our tester\nThe Chicco Bravo Quick-Fold Stroller includes the Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat for a baby-approved combo. The stroller has a compact design and features large wheels with all-wheel suspension for uneven terrain. The overhead canopy is extra large to shield baby from the sun, while the car seat easily snaps into place when needed. Commerce Partnerships Manager, Ryan Murphy, uses this for his son and highly recommends it to other parents.\nNew York Post Review: \u201cThe Chico Bravo Travel System has been fantastic for the last year and a half,\u201d he shared. \u201cWe tested out a few strollers when we were expecting and this one ticked all the boxes. It is extremely versatile, has the base for the back seat of a car, the car seat fits into the stroller base, and when the time comes, the main stroller insert is extremely easy to add in.\u201d\nMurphy praises the compact design of the stroller car seat combo and says its \u201cfairly light.\u201d \u201cMy son loves leaning on the front rack to point to trucks, ducks, really anything that moved! It has two cupholders, a large amount of storage underneath, and a smaller sealed pocket at the handles.\u201d\nDimensions: 35.2\u2033L x 22.8\u2033W x 42.7\u2033H | Weight: 24.9 pounds | Weight capacity: 50 pounds | Tire type: Flat-free, EVA\nBest Stroller for City Living: UPPAbaby Minu V2 Travel Stroller\nPros:\n- Adjustable recline and headrest\n- Lightweight\n- Front and rear spring-action suspension for smoother movement\n- Folds with one hand\nCons:\n- Seat material is on the thinner side, according to one customer review\nIf you live in the big city like the majority of us on the Post Wanted team, you\u2019ll want a stroller that is durable and able to smoothly move over uneven sidewalks and grassy knolls. For Frank Massaro, our other commerce partnerships manager, that stroller is the UPPAbaby Minu V2 Travel Stroller.\nNew York Post Review: \u201cAs a first-time parent, overanalyzing every decision when it comes to your child feels like a part of the playbook and comes with the territory. Thankfully, my wife and I were able to harness the power of our overthinking and turn it into a well-informed purchasing decision in the UPPAbaby Minu 2 stroller,\u201d he shared.\nWhen deciding which stroller to go with, Massaro examined ease of use and tried to determine which models might have a \u201cnegative ROI\u201d within a year of use. After looking at various models, the Minu 2 was his top pick.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an easy product to use,\u201d he said. \u201cJust by taking the stroller out of the box, and spending all but 5 minutes with it, I felt like a pro when it came to switching between the store-away mode and active stroller mode. I was even doing this one handed! With a slide of a button and some momentum, the transitions were incredibly smooth. Everything just felt by design quite easy and I would say UPPAbaby definitely checked the boxes with the Minu 2.\u201d\nIn terms of how the stroller handles in the city, he was also impressed. \u201cStrollers are meant to navigate all types of terrain and so far I have been cruising through it all with no noticeable scratches, dents or loose ends. One of the reasons why my Wife and I ultimately landed on the UPPAbaby ecosystem is because of the flexibility of it all. With a stroller, you will likely wait at least a month or two before putting your child in safely. We were able to buy a Bassinet that easily clips in with an attachment, thus granting us ultimate flexibility and use right out of the gate! As our little one grows, I am sure this will be a great product that will provide more value for the dollars spent.\u201d\nDimensions: 35.5\u2033L x 20.3\u2033W x 41\u2033H| Weight: 16.9 pounds | Weight capacity: 50 pounds | Tire type: n/a | Special features: Can be paired with other accessories, including a bassinet (also available by UPPAbaby)\nHow We Tested\nWhen looking at the best strollers, we considered several things.\n- Ease of set-up: When examining strollers, we gave bonus points to those with a quick, intuitive setup. If we found ourselves having to watch videos or spend more than 30 minutes on the owner\u2019s manual, we knew it didn\u2019t belong on this list.\n- Maneuverability: Our moms and staff took these strollers everywhere \u2014 busy streets, parks, doctor\u2019s visits. They shared their honest thoughts about how strollers moved, what environment they worked best in, and how steering changed when the stroller had their child and belongings inside.\n- Safety features: Because strollers carry the most precious cargo, we had to make sure each stronger had special features to protect little ones. Strollers that had durable frames, harnesses, and wheel locks got our stamps of approval, while those without made us say, Pass.\nWhy Trust Post Wanted by the New York Post\nFor over 200 years, the New York Post has been America\u2019s go-to source for bold news, engaging stories, in-depth reporting, and now, insightful shopping guidance. We\u2019re not just thorough reporters \u2013 we sift through mountains of information, test and compare products, and consult experts on any topics we aren\u2019t already schooled specialists in to deliver useful, realistic product recommendations based on our extensive and hands-on analysis.

      "text": "They say that big things come in small packages.\nApple has proven that thousands of times over, as listeners switch from bulky headphones to the pocket-sized package of a pair of Apple AirPods, and are treated to hours of listening time, noise cancellation, personalized spatial audio, Siri connectivity, and much, much more.\nApple\u2019s never far from our minds, but last month they cropped up again, with the announcement iPhone 16, the brand\u2019s new operating system, iOS 18, and AirPods upgrades, including the brand new Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds, and improvements to Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) that allow for hearing aid functionality.\nBy now, AirPods seem to be a part of the basic fabric of life, as essential to people\u2019s uniforms as their pants, and Apple has taken notice, and the prices keep dropping. That\u2019s great, too, because everyone loves them.\nRELATED: The best over-ear headphones for working out, noise-canceling and more\nWe\u2019ve rounded up the best deals on Apple AirPods that we could find on everything from Apple\u2019s in-ear AirPods to the brand\u2019s newest creation, the over-ear Apple AirPods Max.\nSo read on, take a peek at these great deals, and get listening.\nApple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) Wireless Earbuds\nApple\u2019s newest model of in-ear headphones, the 2nd Generation AirPods Pro with wireless charging case, have all the same features and capabilities as the previous generation, plus many more. With richer audio experience, next-level noise cancellation, and more intuitive controls, Apple truly stepped up its game with its 2nd Generation.\nApple AirPods (3rd Generation)\nThe 3rd Generation Apple AirPods offer Spatial Audio that tracks where your head is about your phone, plus a water and sweat-resistant charging case, and 6 hours of listening time.\nApple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds\nThe Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds feature enhanced sound quality, adaptive noise cancellation, and improved battery life. With seamless connectivity to Apple devices, they offer a comfortable fit and intuitive touch controls. The earbuds support spatial audio for immersive listening and come with a sleek charging case for on-the-go convenience.\nApple AirPods Max\nThe Apple AirPods Max, which came out in Dec. 2020, are the brand\u2019s first over-ear headphones. These headphones feature spatial sound, giving you a three-dimensional listening experience from music, TV shows, movies, podcasts and more \u2014 immersing you in sounds from every direction. The idea is to give the user a theater-like experience so you can feel like you\u2019re in your very own concert hall.\nYou can also enjoy active noise canceling, transparency mode and adaptive EQ, which means the headphones will effectively tailor the sound coming out of them based on the shape of your ear.\nThe AirPods Max give up to 20 hours of listening time on a single charge (it only takes 5 minutes of charging to get around 1.5 hours of audio!), and they\u2019re available in five different colors.\nRELATED: Try an Amazon Prime free trial\nWhy Trust Post Wanted by the New York Post\nThis article was written by P.J.

      "text": "When choosing the best fire pit for your needs, there\u2019s a surprising number of hot topics to consider, pun intended.\nFirst, you want to make sure it\u2019s durable and built to last. Second, you want to make sure the look of it suits your outdoor space. And third, you want to make sure it\u2019s well within your budget \u2014 while still capable of cooking incredible s\u2019mores.\nBelieve us, once you spend a summer with a fire pit in your backyard, you\u2019ll wonder how you could\u2019ve possibly gone so long without one.\nTo that tend, we curated a fiery edit of the best outdoor fire pits to add some heat to your space. And you don\u2019t just have to take our word for it. For expert tips on top selections from Amazon, Lowe\u2019s and more, we spoke to Ashley Murphy, The Home Depot\u2019s resident fire merchant.\n\u201cFirepits are a great addition to any backyard and a must-have for summer,\u201d Murphy told the New York Post. \u201cWhen purchasing fire pits, there a few types that can fit perfectly, no matter which style you\u2019re looking to add to your backyard. Whether you\u2019re looking to entertain, or just something simple to warm up with during a chilly evening, a fire pit has you covered!\u201d\nWhen shopping for fire pits, Murphy said, \u201ckeep in mind that [they] can be a long-lasting addition to your backyard, so choose carefully. If you want a less-permanent option, there are plenty of portable models available for smaller spaces or occasional use.\u201d\n\u201cThe best fire pit for the backyard can also be a prominent part of your d\u00e9cor,\u201d Murphy added. \u201cLook for those that complement your outdoor space or furniture.\u201d\nBelow, we\u2019ve rounded up 24 of our favorite outdoor fire pits on the Internet. No matter the outdoor space that you\u2019re thinking of, we can guarantee there\u2019s a fire pit for you included.\nClick to jump to a specific type of fire pit:\nBest Smokeless Fire Pits\nSinglyFire 22\u2033 Fire Pit\n\u201cA round fire pit is the most common shape,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cLike a campfire, this shape emits heat evenly around the perimeter to help ensure a warm seat for every guest.\u201d\nKeep everyone warm with the SinglyFire 22\u2033 Fire Pit, an incredible budget option that\u2019s stainless steel-painted and can be used as a fire pit, bonfire pit or BBQ grill. Plus its easy assembly and spark screen for safety are both convenient and practical for your backyard.\nSolo Stove Ranger Stainless Steel Smokeless Fire Pit\nMeet the titan of all fire pits. The Solo Stove not only comes in many size varieties, but it\u2019s also one of the most well-adored brands for giving that smokeless and chic delivery.\nThe polished stainless steel finish is bound to match any outdoor space, too. Because of its portable nature, you can also enjoy the flames as a camping fire pit. Most notably, its double-wall design maximizes airflow and the burning process which, in turn, gives you more flames and a more efficient burn.\nBreeo X Series Smokeless Fire Pit\nIf the look of Breeo\u2019s X Series Smokeless Fire Pit isn\u2019t enough to sell you, then its patented X Airflow system will. This results in a \u201ccampfire experience that doesn\u2019t require moving your chair every five minutes,\u201d per the brand.\nNot to mention, the corten steel makeup \u2014 also known as weathering steel \u2014 is designed to develop an iron oxide surface over time, called patina. This reddish-brown coating will wonderfully protect your fire pit from the elements, so it\u2019s built to last.\nVevor 22\u2033 Smokeless Fire Pit with Stand\nThis heavy-duty stainless steel smokeless fire pit from Vevor caught our attention for being durable and coming with a stand (a huge bonus). It\u2019s portable, easy to use and designed by a company known for its high-quality nature.\nThough it\u2019s not 100% smokeless, its double-wall design ensures that smoke will be reduced to a maximum extent, as oxygen is added to the combustion through its vent holes.\nOutland Living Portable Smokeless Fire Pit\nAn Amazon\u2019s Choice product, Outland Living\u2019s Portable Smokeless Fire Pit is an alloy and stainless steel hybrid that\u2019s less than $100 and has an easy-to-transport round design.It even comes with a complete fire pit kit, clad with a pre-attached 10. ft. hose, a fully adjustable regulator with a chrome valve knob for varying flame height and a natural lava rock set for aesthetics and to enhance the flickering effect.\nBioLite FirePit+ Outdoor Smokeless Fire Pit and Grill\nAdored for its rectangular, BBQ-like design, BioLite\u2019s FirePit+ creates a wonderful gather-round-the-campfire experience, many thanks to its X-ray mesh body for 360-degree views.\nInterestingly, you can control the size and intensity of your flames \u2014 either manually or remotely \u2014 with the free Bluetooth paired app.\nTiki Stainless Steel Low Smoke Fire Pit\nNot only do we love the beach house bonfire look of Tiki\u2019s Fire Pit, but its powder-coated stainless steel is durable and will last for years. Plus, this model includes a wood pack (for fun evenings of using it to the max) and a cloth cover to protect it when it\u2019s not in use.\nBest Propane Gas Fire Pits\nBond Manufacturing Portable Propane Gas Fire Pit\nThis top-rated Amazon fire pit is made of metal and stainless steel with a rubbed bronze finish to make a material trifecta that\u2019s built to last. It uses a 20 lb. propane tank that\u2019s not included and is also safe for wood decks.\nHampton Bay Crossridge 50,000 BTU Antique Bronze Gas Fire Pit\n\u201cThis Hampton Bay Crossridge 50,000 BTU Antique Bronze Gas Fire Pit provides up to 50,000 BTU per hour and ensures long-lasting use,\u201d said Murphy. Pick one up for yourself today for less than $350 at the Home Depot.\nVicluke 44\u2033 Aluminum Propane Fire Pit Table with Faux Ledgestone\n\u201cA pair of outdoor lounge chairs and a gas fire pit with a ledge wide enough to rest a glass creates the perfect spot to enjoy a light evening meal or post-dinner nightcap,\u201d Murphy said. This Vicluke\u2019s Aluminum Propane Fire Pit Table fits the bill. Its faux ledgestone exterior evokes the feel of a custom built-in for your outdoor deck and decor. Plus, we love its hibachi-style flames that are housed in the center of the pit.\nAllen + Roth Stacked Stone Propane Gas Fire Pit Table\nIf you want something of a darker tone, round and a bit more modern, look no further than Allen + Roth\u2019s Stacked Stone Propane Gas Fire Pit Table. It\u2019s great for sitting around, too, given its round nature, and is a bit taller than some others we\u2019ve seen.\nLatitude Run Astrath 27\u2033 Concrete Propane Fire Pit\nIf the Latitude Run Astrath Concrete Propane Fire Pit doesn\u2019t give you Hamptons mansion vibes, we don\u2019t know what will. This 40% off beaut has a modern stature and is weather-resistant to enjoy in any season.\nCostway Portable Propane Fire Pit\nMake your outdoor fire pit feel like your favorite camping grounds with this portable model that\u2019s compact and great for entertaining. It\u2019s less than $115 right now, too, and brings a timeless yet modern touch to your backyard \u2014 lava rocks included.\nTeamson Brown Concrete Propane Fire Pit\nAs a relatively affordable fire pit that still consists of a concrete design and propane makeup, Teamson\u2019s model is timeless, easy to use and won\u2019t take up much real estate in your backyard. Not to mention, it\u2019ll definitely be a conversation piece.\nCosmoLiving by Cosmopolitan Astra 23\u2033 Fire Pit\n\u201cIf you love the smell of smoke but prefer indoor living, place a wood fire pit on the patio,\u201d writes Ashley. And then are few better options than this 23-inch Astra model. If you\u2019re looking to toast your favorite outdoor foods for less than $200 (think: s\u2019mores and anything coal-fired), then this sleek white one is for you.\nSunjoy Atticus Outdoor Patio Wood-Burning Fire Place\nHello, outdoor beauty. For less than $2,050, this lifetime-lasting essential is absolutely stunning and has stone-built ins to store faux plants, logs and other entertaining essentials. If you\u2019re renovating your backyard, this piece is our most recommended.\nBali Outdoors Wood-Burning Fire Pit\n\u201cCauldron-style fire pits burn wood slowly, so make sure there\u2019s plenty of comfortable seating for a long evening of relaxing,\u201d Murphy said.\nAs far as wood-burning fire pits go, Bali Outdoors\u2019 model is one of the most affordable without compromising quality. Its cast-iron, hourglass-framed fire pit gives an antique-y feel and has a round-wire mesh screen for safety (so bonus points for being extra kid-friendly).\nAshley Hearth Pedestal Wood-Burning Stove\nForget fire pits \u2014 how about a fire stove? Ideal for roasting marshmallows, making pizza or simply heating up your backyard on a brisker evening, Ashley Hearth\u2019s pedestal design is both breathtaking and practical, clad with beautiful brushed nickel accents, plus it\u2019s at its lowest price in 30 days this week on Amazon.\nBig Horn Black Steel Wood-Burning Fire Pit\nFor a smaller outdoor fire pit, consider Big Horn\u2019s model. For just $269, its swivel grill-height adjustment is worthy of adding to your cart. Not to mention, its oversize fire bowl and heavy-duty gauge legs render it even more stellar for the price.\nStyle Selections Black Steel Wood-Burning Fire Pit\nFor the budget-minded, you can\u2019t beat Style Selections\u2019 model as an easy-to-use, no-frills option. Impressively, its dome-shaped screen minimizes ashes released in the air, so you\u2019re getting an effective burn for less than $175.\nChristopher Knight Home Crestline Outdoor Natural Stone Fire Pit\nThis lovely mixed-tone cobblestone fire pit by Christopher Knight Home (a brand developed by Peter Brady of \u201cThe Brady Bunch,\u201d FYI) is unbeatable for your backyard. Its beautifully accented, contemporary feel is also practical, featuring a protective iron shield that\u2019s great for entertaining guests.\nHampton Bay Quadripod 26 -inch Round Fire Pit\nFor low prices without sacrificing high quality, turn to Hampton Bay. \u201cThis Quadripod 26-inch Round Fire Pit is the perfect size for camping or hanging out in your backyard,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe deep bowl gives you more space for loading more wood, as well as offers a log grate, mesh cover and fire poker.\u201d\nF2C Hex-Shaped Wood-Burning Bonfire Fire Pit\nEqually as great and with a bit more design is F2C\u2019s Hex-Shaped Wood-Burning Bonfire Fire Pit. It\u2019s less than $75 and its domed nature helps control the flames even more (though its open-hexed design allows you to see all the action, too).\nHampton Bay 19-inch Outdoor Stainless Steel Wood Burning Black Matte Low Smoke Fire Pit\n\u201cAnother great wood-burning fire pit is the Hampton Bay 19 in. Outdoor Stainless Steel Wood Burning Black Matte Low Smoke Fire Pit,\u201d Murphy said, and we couldn\u2019t agree more. \u201cWith a higher burn-rate, this pit leaves fewer ashes and reduces smoke.\u201d Plus, it\u2019s under $200 today at Home Depot.\nCheck out the New York Post Shopping section for more content."

      "text": "We\u2019re your buying beacon through the shopping chaos:\nFor over 200 years, the New York Post has been America\u2019s go-to source for bold news, engaging stories, in-depth reporting, and now, insightful shopping guidance.\nFounded in 1801 by the legendary Alexander Hamilton, The Post has witnessed history\u2019s grandest chapters. It only makes sense that in recent years, we\u2019ve turned our keen eye toward the ever-evolving world of online shopping to provide expert product guides.\nEnter, Post Wanted.\nPost Wanted was established to help take the guesswork out of finding what you want online. But before you dive into our curated picks, let\u2019s address the elephant in the room: Why buy from Post Wanted by the New York Post? Why count on us as your trusted online shopping destination for your hard-earned cash?\nWe review with honesty, irreverence, and a dash of wit:\nForget artificially \u201cintelligent\u201d robotic reviews and soulless stories about steals and deals.\nNews devotees trust our fearless reporting and opinions, zodiac zealots trust our best-in-class cosmic coverage, religious real estate readers rely on us for the latest luxury listings, and sports fanatics come to us first for up-to-the-minute score reporting and colorful columnist commentary.\nTherefore, it should be no surprise that savvy shoppers come to Post Wanted for the most wanted sales, shopping guides, and product reviews. We prioritize honesty and integrity above all else because we, just like you, are tired of the convoluted chaos online shopping has become, where trust can be harder to find than the perfect gift for your wife.\nAt Post Wanted, we\u2019re real-life humans, just like you. Our team of seasoned journalists and product enthusiasts spends their days sifting through mountains of information, testing products until our brains go numb, and writing content and reviews so engaging you\u2019ll forget you\u2019re only reading about meal kits (even if that meal kit is life-changing).\nWe go beyond the buzzwords:\nSure, we could bombard you with buzzy brands and technical jargon, but what good does that do? You\u2019re smarter than that. We believe in cutting through the noise and delivering clear, concise information that actually helps you make informed purchasing decisions.\nOur shopping guides are chock-full of real-world insights, pros and cons laid bare, and honest evaluations that leave no stone unturned. We don\u2019t just tell you the 411 on the latest and greatest; we tell you what\u2019s worth your hard-earned dollars, no matter your budget or lifestyle.\nWe\u2019re a community, not just a catalog:\nPost Wanted isn\u2019t just another shopping site for cord-cutters or those good at housekeeping (you know what we\u2019re talking about); it\u2019s a vibrant community of curious minds and discerning shoppers.\nOur content fosters a sense of shared discovery and informed choice. If we haven\u2019t tried it, that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t. Until then, we will continuously update our content to meet industry standards by living in the weeds of customer reviews to separate fact from fluff, researching and testing new competitive product choices, and interviewing leading experts in related fields.\nJust like you, we\u2019re constantly evolving and learning through trial and error, and we always welcome your feedback. After all, a community thrives on dialogue, and we\u2019re all eyes and ears when it comes to your thoughts and experiences.\nWe know transparency is the name of the game:\nWe live in a pay-for-play world of sponsored content and affiliate marketing, and we get it. At best, it can be crowded, but at worst, it can be downright criminal.\nHowever, brutal honesty is kind of our thing. The New York Post built an entire reputation around honest headlines that make headlines. So, at Post Wanted, we clearly label partnership content and disclaim if we receive anything from our affiliate links, so you always know where we stand. By shopping with us, you continue to support our hard work in finding only the best products for you.\nWe aim to empower you with knowledge, not insult you with marketing mumbo jumbo. Our team loves what we do, and you deserve to know what drives our recommendations. We wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\nPost Wanted is where shopping and storytelling meet:\nWhen reading Post Wanted, you won\u2019t lose the New York Post\u2019s legacy of powerful storytelling. We weave our witty real-life experiences into every one of our guides, hopefully making the process of finding the perfect product exciting, not exhausting.\nWe believe informed shopping should be fun \u2013 even addictive \u2013 and we\u2019re here to prove it. So, ditch the endless scrolling and by-the-book reviews and join us on a journey of discovery where knowledge meets wit, and trust is always above the fold.\nWho\u2019s helping you shop:\nJackie Goldstein, Vice President, Commerce\nBarret Wertz, Editorial Director, Commerce\nCamryn La Sala, Editor, Commerce\nHolly J. Coley, Editor, Commerce Updates\nKendall Cornish, Writer/Editor, Commerce\nVictoria Giardina, Journalist & Content Strategist, Commerce\nSophie Cannon, Associate Manager, Commerce Strategy and Development\nP.J.

Let us make your life easier, better, and just maybe a little more fun.\nWe know building trust takes time, but if it still isn\u2019t clear after more than 200 years, we\u2019re here to earn yours \u2013 one product, one gift, one witty review at a time."

      "text": "Along with shopping for patio furniture, best-selling outdoor fire pits, and the full catalog of Amazon home items available, refreshing your space also calls for one of the best vacuums.\nTruthfully, I\u2019m a sucker \u2014 pun totally intended \u2014 for any device, gadget or gizmo that will clean my homes like a charm. I reviewed the best Dyson vacuums, tried my hand at a variety of mops and experimented with all kinds of house cleaning products. Needless to say, I\u2019m a self-proclaimed professional cleaner at this point, and it *sparks joy* for me to try new products, from cordless vacuums to all-purpose cleaners.\n- Best Overall: Shark Cordless PowerDetect Clean & Empty System\n- Best Cordless: Dyson Gen5detect Cordless Vacuum\n- Best Robot: Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop\n- Best for Pet Hair: Roborock Qrevo S Robot Vacuum and Mop\n- Best Stick: Dyson V11 Cordless Stick Vacuum\n- Best Upright: Dyson Ball Animal 2 Upright Vacuum\n- Best for Cars: Craftsman 2.5-Gallon Wet/Dry Shop Vac\n- Best Vacuum-Mop Combo: Roborock S8 Max Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop\n- Best Wet-Dry: Tineco iFloor 3 Breeze Complete Wet-Dry Vacuum\n- Best for Small Spaces: Dyson Omni-Glide Cordless Vacuum\n- Most Lightweight: Dyson V12 Detect Slim+ Cordless Vacuum\nSo, it\u2019s only fitting to curate a major edit of the best vacuums I reviewed. Over the years, myself, along with the Post Wanted team, have tested 15+ vacuums in all shapes and sizes. From cordless to robot models, there\u2019s something on this list for every space and every need.\nClick to jump to a specific section: Best Vacuums We Reviewed | FAQ Section | How We Tested\nBest Vacuums We Reviewed\nBest Overall: Shark Cordless PowerDetect Clean & Empty System\nPros:\n- Multidirectional cleaning\n- Flexible under-furniture reach\n- Smart suction adjustment\n- Hassle-free auto-emptying\n- Long 70-minute runtime\n- Effective on various floor types\n- Powerful pet hair pickup\nCons:\n- Initial learning curve\nThe Shark Cordless PowerDetect Clean & Empty System is an exceptional vacuum. Because of its powerful suction and advanced technology, it ensures a thorough cleaning across multiple surfaces.\nOne of its standout features is the PowerDetect technology, which automatically adjusts the suction power based on the surface it\u2019s cleaning. Whether you\u2019re transitioning from hardwood floors to thick carpets, the vacuum adapts and boasts optimal performance, picking up even the finest dust and debris with ease. This dynamic feature makes it perfect for households with varying floor types, which eliminates the need for manual adjustments.\n\u201cAs soon as it hits a particularly messy spot, you can literally hear the motor kick into high gear,\u201d Barret Wertz, commerce editorial director, shared after testing the model.\nAnother major advantage of the Shark Cordless PowerDetect Clean & Empty System is its user-friendly design, including the Clean & Empty feature that makes maintenance a breeze. Unlike many other vacuums, which require you to wrestle with dirt canisters or messy filter cleaning, this model boasts an easy-to-empty bin with one-touch release. This simplifies disposal, keeping hands clean and minimizing the hassle of vacuum maintenance.\n\u201cThe auto-emptying feature is a huge plus, especially for those with allergies \u2014 no more dust clouds when you\u2019re trying to clean the canister,\u201d Wertz added. \u201cElevate your cleaning game with Shark\u2019s cutting-edge technology.\u201d\nAdditionally, its lightweight and cordless design allows for greater maneuverability, whether you\u2019re cleaning floors, upholstery or even high-up areas like ceiling corners or vents. This portability makes it a great choice for those who want powerful suction without the burden of a bulky machine.\nWith its sleek design, versatile attachments, and auto-empty dock, this Shark vacuum combines power and convenience.\nType: Cordless | Weight: 7.96 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.74 quarts | Runtime: 60 minutes | Charge time: 3 to 4 hours | Warranty: 5-year limited warranty\nBest Cordless Stick Vacuum: Dyson Gen5detect Cordless Vacuum\nPros:\n- Boasts powerful suction and a lightweight design\n- Comes with a built-in crevice tool that makes it simple to switch between a cordless and handheld cleaner\n- Built-in HEPA filter makes it great for those with allergies\nCons:\n- The price point is more expensive than most other Dyson vacuums\nThe Dyson Gen5detect Cordless Vacuum is, by far, the most impressive Dyson vacuum we\u2019ve reviewed in the past four years. Namely, the impressiveness of this cordless model \u2014 from its incredible suction power to its ease of deep cleaning \u2014 makes it worth its high-ticket price tag.\nWhen it comes down to it, you don\u2019t want to keep repurchasing vacuum after vacuum because you didn\u2019t invest in one originally. This all-in-one cordless option boasts up to 70 minutes of runtime and a 4.5-hour charge, making deep cleaning my home a snap.\n\u201cAs a new homeowner, I knew I wanted to unbox the best vacuum so I could actually look forward to deep cleaning days,\u201d Victoria Giardina, commerce journalist and content strategist, shared after testing it for at least two years. \u201cThe Gen5detect Cordless Vacuum didn\u2019t disappoint; it\u2019s simple for me to maneuver from my kitchen to my dining area to my living room, and then upstairs to suck up all of the dust and debris from my plush carpet. It tackles a variety of floors, from engineered laminate to tile and it\u2019s so satisfying to see all the dust enter the dustbin, especially when I use the crevice tool to really capture everything.\u201d\nIt comes with an easy-to-use Fluffy Optic Cleaner Head, along with the more traditional Digital Motorbar Cleaner Head characteristic of several other Dyson cordless models. \u201cThe Built-In Crevice Tool is ultra-convenient because I never have to think about finding a separate attachment,\u201d Giardina added. \u201cWith the touch of a button, I can instantly transform my cordless vacuum into a handheld to tackle dust buildup on my second-floor vaulted ceilings.\u201d\nType: Cordless | Weight: 7.6 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.8 quarts | Runtime: 70 minutes | Charge time: 4.5 hours | Warranty: 2-year limited warranty\nBest Robot Vacuum: Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop\nPros:\n- Leaves floors spotless as it scrubs up to 100 times per minute\n- Easy to follow, with limited to no learning curve\n- Easy to swap out the dustbin\nCons:\n- Must regularly clean and maintain the base station, which may be a downside for some\n\u201cI\u2019m always buried in tasks and struggling to find time for cleaning, yet I can\u2019t stand a messy home,\u201d Emma Sutton-Williams, commerce writer/reporter, shared. \u201cMeet Winston \u2014 my affectionate nickname for the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Self-Empty Robot Vacuum and Mop. It\u2019s become my go-to helper.\u201d\nNot only does it clean Sutton-Williams\u2019 floors, but it also sends her updates in whatever language she chooses (note: she went with UK English). \u201cThanks to the easy-to-follow app and quick setup videos, getting Winston up and running was a breeze,\u201d she added.\nWhat she loves most is that the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop cleans on command, letting her get back to her articles and product testing without interruption. It can also be scheduled and programmed to focus on specific areas for spot cleaning.\n\u201cUsing advanced home mapping technology, the vacuum avoids my designated no-go zones and always knows where to dock after finishing its cleaning route,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also equipped with smart sensors that can detect obstacles (including my dog) from nearly 5 inches away.\u201d\nIts singular side brush and powerful suction really impressed her, especially when it came to tackling corners and hard-to-reach spots. \u201cThe vacuum clears out the area under my floorboard heaters, which other vacuums can\u2019t reach, blasting air to dislodge dirt, hairballs, and other debris,\u201d she noted.\nWhen it\u2019s time to mop, swapping out the dustbin is simple, and the mopping capabilities don\u2019t disappoint. \u201cIt scrubs up to 100 times per minute, leaving my sealed and stained floors looking spotless,\u201d she highlighted. \u201cAlthough it doesn\u2019t have a drying function, I found any residual moisture evaporates quickly, so I don\u2019t have to worry about slipping on wet floors.\u201d\nOne of the best features is its self-emptying canister, which holds up to 60 days\u2019 worth of dirt before needing to be emptied manually. Plus, there\u2019s no need for bags, and the HEPA filtration system traps 99.97% of dust and allergens, making it great for anyone with sensitivities.\nType: Robot | Weight: 9.5 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.42 quarts | Runtime: 120 minutes | Charge time: 3 to 4 hours | Warranty: 1-year limited warranty\nBest Vacuum for Pet Hair: Roborock Qrevo S Robot Vacuum and Mop\nPros:\n- Precise cleaning with the anti-tangle brush roll and powerful vacuum-mop cleaning combination\n- Available in both white and black finishes to best suit your aesthetic\n- Compatible with an app for convenience\nCons:\n- Longer time to charge than most vacuum models on this list, though not a dealbreaker given its run time\nThe Roborock Qrevo S Robot Vacuum and Mop is a game-changer, especially if you\u2019re dealing with any amount of pet hair. \u201cWith two pups, Gloria and Mingo (and R.I.P. to our third, Margot), I needed something that could keep up, and the QRevo delivered,\u201d Wertz said after reviewing the model.\nThis vacuum is a mid-level model, but don\u2019t let that fool you, it\u2019s packed with features that make it a serious contender for the best robot vacuum for pet hair. It features an anti-tangle brush roll that helps prevent fur from wrapping around the brush, giving a consistent performance even in homes with shedding pets. You\u2019ll appreciate the model\u2019s high suction power that picks up even the most stubborn strands from both carpets and hard floors, while the mopping function lifts and traps remaining residue for spotless, fresh floors.\nThe Roborock Qrevo S Robot Vacuum and Mop is worth buying because it combines powerful suction with advanced mopping functionality, allowing it to effectively clean both carpets and hard floors in one pass. Its intelligent navigation system ensures thorough coverage of your home, efficiently mapping rooms and avoiding obstacles while cleaning.\nWhat\u2019s more, its long-lasting battery and easy-to-use app control make it a convenient and reliable choice for anyone seeking a hands-off, high-performance cleaning solution.\n\u201cThe QRevo is a vacuum and mop combo, which is already a big win in my book,\u201d Wertz added. \u201cIt has a powerful 7,000 Pa suction system that easily pulls in dirt, dust, and pet hair. But what really sets it apart is the dual spinning mops that lift up when the vacuum detects carpet; this means you can have your hard floors mopped and your carpets vacuumed in one go without worrying about getting your rugs wet.\u201d\nHe noted that the mopping system is quite impressive as well, with pads that spin at 200 revolutions per minute.\nWertz named its multifunctional dock the \u201cstar of the show\u201d as it empties the vacuum\u2019s dustbin, washes and dries the mop pads and refills the water tank. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a robot vacuum dock do so much all by itself. It\u2019s like having a little cleaning crew on standby, ready to spring into action whenever needed,\u201d he said. \u201cFor someone like me, who doesn\u2019t have time to fuss with cleaning supplies every other day, this level of automation is a dream.\u201d\nWhile it can occasionally bump into things or struggle with very cluttered spaces, it\u2019s a small trade-off for the price.\nType: Robot | Weight: 9.9 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.52 quarts | Runtime: 180 minutes | Charge time: 4 to 5 hours | Warranty: 1-year limited warranty\nBest Handheld Vacuum: BISSELL Pet Hair Eraser Lithium Ion Cordless Hand Vacuum\nPros:\n- Most comparable to full-sized vacuums in terms of suction power and efficiency\n- Comes with a motorized brush tool\n- Features a spacious, easy-to-empty dirt tank\nCons:\n- Larger than most other models tested, which may be a dealbreaker for some\n- Shorter runtime\nThe BISSELL Pet Hair Eraser Lithium Ion Cordless Hand Vacuum is a compact, powerful tool \u2014 but pet owners aren\u2019t the only ones to reap its benefits. It features a high-performance lithium-ion battery that offers consistent power throughout its runtime, making it ideal for spot cleaning upholstery, stairs, car interiors, and even tight corners. The vacuum\u2019s sleek, lightweight design makes it easy to handle and maneuver, so you can tackle those harder-to-reach areas without strain.\n\u201cFrom the moment it first powered on, the BISSELL Pet Hair Eraser Lithium Ion Cordless Hand Vacuum impressed me,\u201d Giardina shared. \u201cIt\u2019s the ideal size for a handheld vacuum (though larger than most) but it has essentially the same power and efficiency as my cordless vacuums that cost upwards of $800. I know, total shock factor.\u201c\nThis model is also low priced at less than $100 and ideal for any user \u2014 whether you\u2019re in college, live in a studio apartment or own a five-bedroom home and want some convenience. It boasts nearly 32,000 applauding reviews on Amazon alone! The reason? It\u2019s a pet vacuum, first and foremost, so its ability to pick up pet hair crosses over to the usual bathroom floor hair, under-bed dust and more.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a pet at home, and the fact that this handheld vacuum has ranked above the pack [of other handheld vacuums] is telling,\u201d Giardina added. \u201cUpon purchase, you\u2019ll also receive a motorized brush tool and \u2014 one of the best parts \u2014 a large, easy-to-empty dirt tank.\u201d\nThe BISSELL Pet Hair Eraser also offers user-friendly features like an easy-to-empty dirt bin, which reduces the hassle of disposal, and a washable filter that helps maintain suction power. The lithium-ion battery provides up to 17 minutes of runtime on a full charge, which is perfect for smaller, quick cleaning sessions.\nWhile the vacuum\u2019s bin capacity is relatively small, it\u2019s well-suited for short cleaning tasks, especially in areas where hair accumulates the most. Its affordable price and effective performance make it a must-have for any user, truly.\nType: Handheld | Weight: 3 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.72 quarts | Runtime: 17 minutes | Charge time: 4 hours | Warranty: 2-year limited warranty\nBest Upright Vacuum Cleaner: Dyson Ball Animal 2 Upright Vacuum\nPros:\n- Wonderful for deep-cleaning, especially on textured rugs, due to its generous bin capacity that\u2019s greater than other models on this list\n- An upright design that prevents the vacuum from falling over when placed down for a few minutes\n- Boasts more of a traditional design, making it easy to navigate, especially for older users\nCons:\n- Isn\u2019t cordless\n- Quite heavy, making it difficult to vacuum a multi-floor home in one session\nThe tried-and-true Dyson Ball Animal 2 Vacuum is the perfect cleaner for thick carpets. And when we say thick, we mean thick. Powered by Dyson\u2019s patented Radial Root Cyclone technology, it delivers incredible suction that captures even the smallest dust particles, dirt, and pet hair. Whether you\u2019re cleaning carpets, hard floors, or upholstery, the Dyson Ball Animal 2 excels at picking up debris.\nIts self-adjusting cleaner head automatically adjusts to different floor types, ensuring optimal suction on both high-pile carpets and smooth hard surfaces, making it perfect for households with a mix of flooring.\nIt\u2019s impressive that this model isn\u2019t cordless but still comes with accessories to transform the power vac into a precise cleaning machine. And there\u2019s even a mattress tool, which is ideal. Let\u2019s face it \u2014 when\u2019s the last time you gave your everyday mattress a spin clean?\n\u201cThe textured rugs in my parents\u2019 home aren\u2019t fine; they have a crazy shag, deep-rooted Berber and macrame boho area rugs that I personally don\u2019t know how to give a true deep cleaning to,\u201d Giardina noted. \u201cHowever, the Ball Animal 2 is an effective solution.\u201d\nOne of the standout features of the Dyson Ball Animal 2 is its ball technology, which allows for easy steering and maneuverability around furniture and obstacles. The vacuum\u2019s ball design pivots smoothly, making it much easier to navigate tight spaces compared to traditional upright vacuums.\nThe vacuum also comes with a range of attachments, including a tangle-free turbine tool that effectively removes pet hair from upholstery, stairs, and other surfaces without the hassle of hair wrapping around the brush bar.\nType: Corded | Weight: 17.42 pounds | Bin capacity: 1.9 quarts | Runtime: N/A, due to its corded design | Charge time: N/A | Warranty: 5-year limited warranty\nBest Car Vacuum: Craftsman 2.5-Gallon Wet/Dry Shop Vac\nPros:\n- Extremely generous bin capacity, allowing you to clean multiple times before emptying\n- Lightweight and simple to maneuver around your vehicle\n- Easy to store in your garage or shed\nCons:\n- Can be quite noisy, though not a dealbreaker given its performance\nThe Craftsman 2.5-Gallon Wet/Dry Shop Vac is a compact and powerful vacuum designed for tackling both wet and dry messes in the workshop, garage or home. With a 2.5-gallon capacity, this shop vac strikes a balance between portability and functionality, making it ideal for smaller clean-up tasks without taking up too much storage space.\nIts lightweight design (weighing only about 7 pounds) and built-in handle make it easy to carry around, whether you\u2019re cleaning up dust, debris or liquid spills. Despite its compact size, the vacuum is equipped with a robust motor that delivers strong suction.\n\u201cMy parents own this shop vac, and I\u2019m constantly pulling my SUV into the driveway to deep clean my vehicle whenever I visit,\u201d said Giardina. It\u2019s by far the best deep-cleaning device for automobiles, particularly because of its easy-to-maneuver hose and ability to suck all of the dirt and debris from my seat floors, console area, and trunk rim.\u201d\nOne of the standout features of the Craftsman 2.5-Gallon Wet/Dry Shop Vac is its versatility in handling both wet and dry messes. The vacuum comes with a 2.5 horsepower motor, offering strong suction power that can handle everything from dirt and sawdust to spilled liquids. The included accessories, such as the 1-1/4-inch hose, crevice tool, and utility nozzle.\nWhat\u2019s more, its 6-foot power cord gives ample reach, allowing her to clean larger areas without having to constantly switch outlets. \u201cI never had to worry about cleaning my car straight from the garage,\u201d Giardina added. \u201cI always placed my shop vac on the driveway, moving the hose as I need to. It\u2019s super convenient and surely a homeowner\u2019s staple.\u201d\nType: Shop Vac, Corded | Weight: 6.7 pounds | Bin capacity: 10.1 quarts | Runtime: N/A, due to its corded design | Charge time: N/A | Warranty: 1-year limited warranty\nBest Vacuum-Mop Combo: Roborock S8 Max Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop\nPros:\n- Boasts AI-powered obstacle avoidance\n- Incredible suction power at 10,000 Pa\n- Makes your floors gleam after each use\nCons:\n- Expensive price point\n- Longer time to charge than most vacuum models on this list, though not a dealbreaker given its run time\nThe Roborock S8 Max Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop is a top-of-the-line cleaning robot that seamlessly combines powerful suction with advanced mopping capabilities. Featuring an upgraded 5500 Pa suction power, it easily picks up dirt, dust, pet hair and even larger debris from carpets, hardwood floors, and tiles.\nThis vacuum powerhouse is equipped with an auto-lifting mop, which raises the mop attachment when it detects carpet; this allows it to efficiently vacuum and mop in one go without getting the carpet wet. On that note, it\u2019s perfect for homes with both hard floors and carpeted areas, offering a thorough cleaning without the need for manual intervention.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for the ultimate cleaning machine, this is it. The Roborock S8 Max Ultra is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of robot vacuums,\u201d Wertz said. \u201cThis beast has it all: 10,000 Pa of suction power, advanced mopping power, and a RockDock Ultra that takes care of everything from emptying to hot drying.\u201d\nThe S8 Max Ultra is not just a vacuum; it\u2019s a full-fledged cleaning system designed to make your life easier. Whether it\u2019s spills in the kitchen, crumbs under the couch or dust bunnies under the bed, this vacuum picks up everything.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got hard floors, the advanced VibraRise 2.0 mopping system will leave them gleaming,\u201d he said. \u201cThis system uses sonic vibrations to scrub floors at 4,000 vibrations per minute, which means even the most stubborn dirt doesn\u2019t stand a chance. And let\u2019s not forget the self-cleaning feature that keeps the dock itself spotless. It\u2019s like having a personal cleaning assistant on call 24/7.\u201d\nThe Roborock S8 Max Ultra excels in intelligent navigation, utilizing LiDAR and advanced mapping technologies to efficiently clean your home. It creates precise maps of your home\u2019s layout, allowing it to navigate with precision and avoid obstacles. This model supports multi-level mapping, too, so it can remember different floors and areas of your home, providing consistent cleaning across levels.\nWhat\u2019s more, the vacuum\u2019s AI-powered obstacle avoidance helps it detect and navigate around objects like furniture, cords and pet toys, reducing the risk of getting stuck or damaging items during cleaning. It can also automatically adjust suction power based on the type of flooring it encounters, maximizing cleaning efficiency while conserving energy.\n\u201cOne of my favorite features of the S8 Max Ultra is the built-in video camera,\u201d Wertz added. \u201cAs a dog dad who\u2019s outright obsessed with my pups, I love being able to check in on them while the vacuum does its thing. The camera allows me to see what\u2019s happening at home, which is especially reassuring when I\u2019m out and about.\u201d\nOf course, all this luxury comes at a price. \u201cThe S8 Max Ultra is definitely an investment, but if you value convenience and want the best of the best, it\u2019s worth every penny,\u201d Wertz concluded.\nType: Robot | Weight: 12.1 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.48 quarts | Runtime: 180 minutes | Charge time: 4 to 5 hours | Warranty: 1-year limited warranty\nBest Wet-Dry: Tineco iFloor 3 Breeze Complete Wet-Dry Vacuum\nPros:\n- Lightweight to maneuver while featuring unbelievable suction power\n- Quick-drying when used on hardwood floors\n- Chic, modern buttons and features\n- Also one of the best vacuums for hardwood floors\nCons:\n- Short runtime, compared to other vacuums we tested\n- Brand-specific cleaning solution sold separately\n- Bins could slide into the body of the vacuum more easily\nAs made viral on Amazon, the Tineco iFloor 3 Breeze Complete Wet-Dry Vacuum is a versatile and innovative cleaning tool designed to make both wet and dry cleaning more efficient and convenient. it combines the functions of a vacuum and a mop into one device and is equipped to clean hard floors like tile, wood and laminate with ease.\nIts powerful suction picks up dirt, debris and liquid spills simultaneously, making it perfect for just about anyone looking to clean up a mess. The built-in smart sensors automatically adjust the suction power and water flow based on the floor type, ensuring optimal performance across different surfaces while preserving energy and water usage.\n\u201cWhen I first began using the Tineco model, I was floored at how modern and cutting-edge its technology was,\u201d Giardina noted. I\u2019m partial to my Dyson vacuums, but I do feel like this one has a more durable frame \u2014 and is *way* less expensive than most Dyson models. I visibly see it sucking up dust from a further distance away than some other vacuums I tried, too, a nod to its impressive suction power.\u201d\nWith more than 10,000 shoppers purchasing the Tineco wet-dry vacuum each month, it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s worth the cost. One of the standout features is its self-cleaning function, which keeps the vacuum and mop rollers free from dirt and debris after each use. With the push of a button, the device automatically cleans the roller and flushes the dirty water tank, making it easy to maintain.\nThe vacuum also includes a washable water tank, allowing you to refill and clean it when you need to. While it could move into the body of the vacuum more easily, it\u2019s not a dealbreaker. Giardina usually lays the vacuum on the floor to pop into the water tank.\nThe vacuum also includes its compatible solution which not only smells amazing but is key for deep cleaning your floors. The con to this is that you\u2019ll have to repurchase the solution, though it\u2019s worth the routine pick-me-up. Its lightweight design is also wonderful, especially for your weekend deep cleanings.\nType: Wet-Dry, Cordless | Weight: 9.26 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.63 quarts | Runtime: 25 minutes | Charge time: 4 hours | Warranty: 2-year limited warranty\nBest for Small Spaces: Dyson Omni-Glide Cordless Vacuum\nPros:\n- The most compact Dyson vacuum tested, making it great for small spaces\n- Glides into corners exceptionally well\n- Easy to maintain and store\nCons:\n- Low bin capacity, so not great for large spaces\nWhen Giardina first unboxed Dyson\u2019s Omni-Glide, she was shocked at how small it was. Sure, stick and cordless vacuums are the new wave, but this was only a few inches taller than her 4-year-old niece.\nThat said, the saying \u201csmall, but mighty\u201d was certainly in mind when Dyson designed the Omni-Glide. In fact, it\u2019s Dyson\u2019s slimmest and most maneuverable vacuum for hard floors, featuring the brand\u2019s first omnidirectional soft roller cleaner head that literally glides into hard-to-reach places.\n\u201cI vacuumed my living room, then walked upstairs to vacuum my bedroom, and then went outside to vacuum a small rug \u2014 and the whole cleaning process took me less than 10 minutes. Why? The vacuum is so lightweight!\u201d she added.\nAlso a best stick vacuum, the Omni-Glide is a true answer to prayer for anyone who gets frustrated lifting a heavy cleaning tool. While it\u2019s a surefire perfect match for handheld dusting with the included crevice tool, it\u2019s also impressive at sucking up dirt on tile floor, debris in floor molding, and even in between your stair rails \u2014 all with velvet-like, soft nylon brush bars.\nYou can either store the Omni-Glide with the included wall-mounted charging dock \u2014 which is great for apartment closet storage \u2014 or concentrate the cleaning device in-line under your bed or couch.\nWith the help of Dyson\u2019s follow-along video, it hasn\u2019t been easier to learn how to properly care for the new tool. Plus, emptying the bin is hands-free and shoots out straight from the vacuum\u2019s storage when ready.\nTake note of the floors you\u2019re looking to clean, too. \u201cIf you have intense shag (as my parents\u2019 house does) or Berber-textured carpet, this isn\u2019t the vacuum for you,\u201d she noted. \u201cWhile it does glide, I felt like it didn\u2019t pick up embedded dust on coarser, soft floors. However, it\u2019s dynamite on hard floors, especially the deep multi-colored brown tile in my kitchen, which is always difficult to spot where dirt lays.\u201d\nType: Cordless | Weight: 4.1 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.21 quarts | Runtime: 20 minutes | Charge time: 3.5 hours | Warranty: 2-year limited warranty\nMost Lightweight: Dyson V12 Detect Slim+ Cordless Vacuum\nPros:\n- Precise, with advanced cleaning demographics that display on its screen in live time\n- Slim, space-saving design\n- Impressive runtime\nCons:\n- More expensive than other Dyson vacuums on this list\n- Not as \u201csturdy\u201d as some other vacuums because of its slim composition (doesn\u2019t have as firm of a grip as some others), but is effective and powerful nonetheless\nDyson\u2019s V12 Detect Slim Vacuum is one of the most of-age vacuums we\u2019ve ever tested \u2014 and that includes our experience with robot vacuums. It\u2019s also one of the most lightweight models that still boasts incredible suction power.\nDubbed Dyson\u2019s \u201cmost compact intelligent cordless vacuum,\u201d it\u2019s clad with laser technology that scientifically shows you how well it\u2019s cleaning on its built-in LCD screen. The screen shows what has been sucked up, while its piezo sensor sizes and counts the number of dust particles to automatically increase the suction power. In short, it\u2019s pretty ground-breaking.\nIn tandem with the crevice tool and easy-to-maneuver stick handle, the V12 Detect is incredibly high-tech and apt for all kinds of spaces. This is huge, especially if you\u2019re really particular with your deep-cleaning sessions.\n\u201cAdditionally, its LCD Screen proves to me, as a consumer, how much time and energy was put into designing this vacuum,\u201d Giardina noted. \u201cDyson wants you to comprehend exactly how it\u2019s getting the job done \u2014 and it gets the job done efficiently!\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t take Giardina long to vacuum her smaller-sized spaces, so the up-to-60 minutes of run time is a wonderful aspect of the V12 Detect. \u201cIf I\u2019m cleaning my entire house, it\u2019s still amazing, and when I clean just one room, I know it\u2019ll never die on me,\u201d she added.\nWhile all good vacuums locate and remove dust from your floors, the V12 Detect\u2019s Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head has built-in laser technology you can\u2019t normally see, ensuring you won\u2019t miss anything. At the end of your cleaning session, your rooms will never look more refreshed.\nDyson\u2019s V12 Detect is anywhere from $500 to $700, depending on sales, which is comparable to some robot vacuums that do it all for you. That said, we still love working the vacuum ourselves as it\u2019s so simple to use, but it\u2019s one con to consider before purchasing.\nType: Cordless | Weight: 5.2 pounds | Bin capacity: 0.8 quarts | Runtime: 60 minutes | Charge time: 4.5 hours | Warranty: 2-year limited warranty\nMost Versatile: Miele Triflex HX2 Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner\nPros:\n- Suction power is the best I\u2019ve ever used cleaning all the dirt off my floor\n- Two-for-one vacuum converting from a handheld to a stick\n- Comes with a HEPA Lifetime Filter and upholstery, crevice and dusting attachment\n- Works on hard floor, shag and low-pile\nCons:\n- The canister is a little tricky to pull off, but once you get the back of it, you\u2019re fine \u2014 it doesn\u2019t bother me too much\nEmma Sutton-Williams, commerce writer/reporter has swapped her Dyson V8 for the much more powerful Miele Triflex HX2 Cordless Stick Vacuum, and she couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\u201cThe suction power was what sold me after testing the best cordless vacuums, comparing them side by side,\u201d she shared. \u201cI was impressed right away, though the almost $800 price tag had me saving up for a bit!\u201d\nThe Miele Triflex HX2 can function as either a stick or handheld vacuum by simply unclipping the attachments, which come off pretty easily.\n\u201cSince I live in an apartment, I don\u2019t need it to run for a full 60 minutes, but when I get into cleaning, I tend to go for a while, and I\u2019ve found the battery lasts only 45-2024ish minutes,\u201d Sutton-Williams explained. \u201cThat\u2019s plenty for me but not as advertised.\u201d\nIt\u2019s incredibly easy to use, lightweight and maneuvers under furniture with impressive flexibility.\n\u201cReleasing the canister might require a quick peek at the manual, but once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s simple,\u201d she added. \u201cInside is the HEPA Lifetime Filter, which pops out and is easy to rinse clean. Overall, I\u2019m giving this vacuum five stars!\u201d\nType: Stick | Weight: 8 pounds | Bin capacity: Unlisted | Runtime: 60 minutes | Charge time: 4.5 hours | Warranty: 2-year limited warranty\nDeals We Love\nAn FAQ on Vacuums\nYour shopping guide to vacuums\nAhead, the Post Wanted team put together a cheat sheet to reference before making your next vacuum purchase above.\nType\n- Upright Vacuums: Ideal for large homes with carpets, upright vacuums provide powerful suction and larger dustbin capacities. They are often bulkier and heavier but are great for deep cleaning.\n- Canister Vacuums: Offering more maneuverability, canister vacuums are ideal for hard-to-reach places and homes with a variety of surfaces. They are often lighter than upright models.\n- Stick Vacuums: Perfect for smaller spaces, quick clean-ups and homes with hard floors, stick vacuums are commonly lightweight and typically cordless, but may have smaller dustbins.\n- Robot Vacuums: Great for automation and hands-free cleaning, robot vacuums are ideal for maintenance cleaning, yet less effective for deep cleaning or handling larger debris.\n- Handheld Vacuums: Useful for small messes, upholstery, stairs and car interiors, handheld vacuums are compact but not ideal for whole-house cleaning.\nFiltration System\n- HEPA Filters: Look for vacuums with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, which trap fine particles, allergens and dust. These are especially beneficial for allergy sufferers and homes with pets.\n- Carbon or Anti-Bacterial Filters: Some vacuums feature filters designed to neutralize odors or reduce bacterial growth, which is a great option for homes with pets.\n- Cyclonic Filtration: Many modern vacuums, especially Dyson models, use cyclonic filtration to help maintain strong suction power by preventing dust from clogging the filter.\nMotor\n- The motor is the heart of the vacuum, determining how powerful the suction will be. Brushless motors are more efficient, quieter, and longer-lasting than traditional brushed motors.\n- Higher-wattage motors generally provide better suction power, especially in vacuums intended for carpet or deep cleaning.\nSuction Power\n- Suction power is measured in air watts (AW) or Pascal (Pa) pressure for robotic vacuums. The higher the suction power, the more effectively the vacuum picks up dirt, debris, and pet hair.\n- For deep cleaning, especially on carpets, a vacuum with high suction power (usually 200-300 AW) is preferred.\n- Adjustable suction settings can be useful, allowing you to modify the power based on floor type (low for hard floors, high for carpets).\nNoise Level\n- Noise level is measured in decibels (dB), with quieter vacuums typically falling under 70 dB. If noise is a concern, particularly in households with pets or young children, opt for quieter models that fall within the 60-70 dB range.\n- Some manufacturers provide decibel ratings, but keep in mind that suction power and noise level may be correlated; stronger suction may produce more noise.\nBattery versus Corded\n- Cordless Vacuums: Provide more flexibility and are ideal for quick clean-ups or homes with limited storage. However, the runtime is limited by battery life (usually 20 to 60 minutes, depending on the model), and they need to be recharged.\n- Corded Vacuums: Offer continuous power, so you don\u2019t need to worry about battery life or charging. They are often preferred for larger homes or deep cleaning, but the cord limits mobility.\n- Battery Capacity: For cordless vacuums, look for lithium-ion batteries that offer better performance, longer runtime, and faster charging compared to other battery types.\nPrice\n- Budget Models: Basic models with lower suction power and fewer features start at around $50-$100. These are good for light cleaning but may lack the durability and suction power of higher-end models.\n- Mid-Range Models: Typically priced between $150-$300, these vacuums offer a balance of power, durability and additional features like HEPA filtration, adjustable suction power or longer battery life.\n- High-End Models: $400 and above for premium models with advanced features such as strong suction power, advanced filtration, smart navigation (robot vacuums), quiet operation, or specialized attachments for pet hair and deep cleaning.\nWhat is the best vacuum?\nBased on our testing, the best vacuum is the Shark Cordless PowerDetect Clean & Empty System. Given its price point and performance, it caters to a wide variety of shoppers, is easy to maneuver and hails from a top brand.\nAre stick vacuums as good as regular vacuums?\nTo most people, stick vacuums can be just as good as regular vacuums, depending on your cleaning needs, home size and preferences. While upright and canister vacuums are typically more powerful and suited for deep cleaning larger areas, stick vacuums offer several advantages that make them a compelling choice for many households.\nStick vacuums are much lighter than traditional uprights or canister models, making them easier to carry and maneuver around furniture and tight spaces. Not to mention, most are cordless. They\u2019re convenient for quick and easy cleanups and simple to empty.\nHowever, stick vacuums tend to have limited suction power and smaller dustbins. If you have a larger home or desire a vacuum that can tackle a variety of cleaning tasks, a traditional vacuum \u2014 like the Dyson Ball Animal 2 Upright Vacuum or the Dyson Gen5detect Cordless Vacuum \u2014 may be more your speed.\nWhat vacuum has the highest suction power?\nThe suction power of a vacuum refers to the strength of a model\u2019s airflow which, in turn, impacts how much dirt and debris it picks up.\nThe suction power varies for different types of vacuums, with the type of vacuum itself impacting its suction power, on average:\n- Upright and canister vacuums: Typically have 100\u2013220 AW of suction power\n- Handheld vacuums: Typically have 15\u201360 AW of suction power\n- Cordless stick vacuums: Typically have 100\u2013280 AW of suction power\n- Robot vacuums: Typically have 2,500\u20136,000 Pa of suction power\nAmong the vacuums the Post Wanted team has tested, the Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop has the most significant suction power.\nHow I Tested\nBelow, find the rigorous testing criteria the Post Wanted team followed when reviewing the best vacuums for years. Of course, several factors should be considered when shopping for your next quality vacuum to ensure it meets your specific cleaning needs and fits within your lifestyle.\n- Suction Power: Look for vacuums with adjustable suction settings so you can fine-tune the power for different surfaces. High suction power is particularly important for deep cleaning carpets, picking up pet hair or handling larger debris.\n- Filtration System: HEPA filters are great for those with allergies. Additionally, consider vacuums with multi-stage filtration or washable filters for easy maintenance and long-term performance.\n- Type: Whether cordless, upright, stick, vacuum, wet-dry or handheld, vacuums come in all shapes and sizes. It\u2019s important to thoroughly read our individual reviews to note which one is best suited for your lifestyle.\n- Capacity: You\u2019ll want to look for a vacuum with a spacious dustbin capacity to ensure it can last for long cleaning sessions. On this note, runtime is another important factor.\n- Noise level: Some vacuums are so exceptional, noise isn\u2019t a big deal. However, it is something to note, especially if you tend to do your cleaning at times when other people in the household are sleeping or in need of some quiet time.\n- Attachments and special features: Varying from vacuum to vacuum, characteristics like built-in crevice tools and the ability to double as a mop add to certain models\u2019 appeal. Not to mention, hands-free cleaning and smart home mapping, which you\u2019ll find integrated into plenty of robot vacuums.\nWhy Trust Post Wanted by the New York Post\nThis article was written by Victoria Giardina, New York Post Commerce Journalist & Content Strategist.

      "text": "If there\u2019s anything we don\u2019t like, it\u2019s being subject to sticky, sweltering temps in the summer. So, we turn to (and quite literally, turn on) the best air conditioners that we\u2019ve found on the market.\nIt\u2019s one of those practical luxuries you can\u2019t seem to neglect as your weather app is circulating with sun emojis, right? They\u2019re a worthwhile investment and one worth picking up ASAP, along with the best humidifiers, fans and dehumidifiers we rounded up.\nAfter all, now\u2019s the perfect time to grab one for yourself and enjoy all-day cool comfort before the temperatures rise any further. We consulted experts and thoroughly tested AC units to help you understand how to choose the right air conditioner for your needs.\n\u201cAir conditioners help maintain a comfortable indoor temperature during the warmer months by keeping the heat out and the cool air in,\u201d Brian Shaunfield, store manager at Charlotte area Lowe\u2019s, told the New York Post. \u201cShoppers should consider other features important to them, ranging from aesthetics, smart capabilities, price and more.\u201d\n- Best Overall Window Unit: Midea 8,000 BTU Smart Inverter Window Air Conditioner\n- Best Overall Wall Unit: LG 7,800 BTU Through the Wall Air Conditioner\n- Best Mini Air Conditioner: LG LW6024RSMX Window Air Conditioner\n- Best Ductless Air Conditioner: MRCOOL DIY 12k BTU 22 Ductless Mini Split AC\n- Best Portable: Dreo Portable Air ConditionersResidential Central Air Conditioner\nShaunfield hand-picked the best air conditioners to make life easy-breezy for you, while we listed other top-rated options for you to choose from. Plus, Shaunfield details his expertise in our in-depth FAQ section to provide an overview of every type of air conditioner.\nBest Overall Window Unit: Midea 8,000 BTU Smart Inverter Window Air Conditioner\nPros:\n- Works with the SmartHome app, Alexa, and Google Assistant for hands-free remote control from anywhere\n- Inverter technology reduces energy use by over 35%, and it\u2019s Energy Star certified for added savings\n- Easy to clean with a washable filter is accessible from the front panel\nCons:\n- Cools up to 350 square feet, so it may not be sufficient for large open-concept spaces, but larger options are available\nDesigned for rooms up to 350 square feet, this 8,000 BTU smart inverter window air conditioner delivers fast, energy-efficient cooling with ultra-quiet operation. It best fits smaller spaces like bedrooms, offices or apartments. However, you can upgrade to a 24,000 BTU option if you have a larger space. With built-in Wi-Fi, you can control it from anywhere using the SmartHome app, Alexa, or Google Assistant, while the inverter technology cuts energy use by over 35% compared to standard models.\nCustomers are saying: \u201cI replaced a twelve-year-old LG that I realized just wasn\u2019t blowing very cold. Wow, what a difference! Much quieter too! I installed it in a 22 1/4\u2033 wide opening, smaller than the listed minimum. Just do not use the expansion frame on one side. Takes a bit of jury rigging, but you can make it work.\u201d\nDimensions: 18.54\u2033D x 18.98\u2033W x 13.58\u2033H | Btu Rating Options: 8,000 to 24,000 options | Cooling Area: 350 square feet | Weight: n/a | Energy Efficiency Ratings: n/a\nBest Overall Wall Unit: LG 7,800 BTU Through the Wall Air Conditioner\nPros:\n- Control the temperature from across the room with a full-function remote\n- Energy saver function conserves energy and saves money\nCons:\n- Some reviewers say the sleeve should have been constructed with holes for the trim frame so it sits flush on the wall\n\u201cThe 4-way air deflection directs the flow of air where it\u2019s needed most, whether cooling, dehumidifying or just circulating air,\u201d said Shaunfield.\nKey features of this best wall air conditioner include a 24-hour programmable timer, Sleep Mode for nighttime energy savings, and three fan speeds that allow users to adjust airflow to their comfort. The Auto Restart function is especially convenient, automatically resuming operation after power interruptions while preserving previous settings.\nCustomers are saying: \u201cI bought this LG through-the-wall air conditioner to replace my old window unit that was noisy and inefficient. I am very happy with my purchase. This air conditioner is quiet, powerful, and easy to use. It cools my bedroom quickly and evenly, and keeps the temperature and humidity at a comfortable level\u2026I would highly recommend it!\u201d\nDimensions: 21.5\u2033D x 24\u2033W x 14.5\u2033H | Btu Rating Options:8,000-12,000 options | Cooling Area: 350 cubit feet | Weight: n/a | Energy Efficiency Ratings: n/a\nBest Mini Air Conditioner: LG LW6024RSMX Window Air Conditioner\nPros:\n- Ideal for small windows, especially useful in NYC apartments where standard units may not fit\n- A convenient small air conditioner to operate from anywhere in the room\n- Reduces humidity and adds comfort during sticky summer months\nCons:\n- May not be powerful enough to cool large rooms or entire apartments\nNew York Post Review: \u201cI love this window air conditioner for my apartment because it perfectly suits my window, especially given the small window that makes fitting an AC unit in New York a challenge.\nThe remote control feature makes adjusting settings super convenient from anywhere in the room, and I have it set up to my Google device for voice activation, making it even easier to turn on from bed when I\u2019m feeling lazy.\nThe built-in dehumidifier is a huge bonus for keeping my apartment comfortable and preventing that sticky, humid feeling that\u2019s so common during NYC summers. If you have a larger apartment, you may need more than one unit, as it may not produce enough cooling power to adequately cool a large space on its own. Overall, though, this AC is a match for my apartment\u2019s unique setup, and I\u2019m just grateful to have cooler air.\u201d \u2013 Emma Sutton-Williams, commerce reporter\nDimensions: 12.83\u2033D x 17.32\u2033W x 11.14\u2033H | Btu Rating Options: 6,000 | Cooling Area: 250 square feet | Weight: 37 pounds | Energy Efficiency Ratings: 11\nBest Portable Air Conditioner: Dreo Portable Air Conditioners\nPros:\n- Easy-to-read LCD display\n- Magnetic remote\nCons:\n- Extremely large\nNew York Post Review: \u201cWhat initially attracted me to The DREO Portable Air Conditioner was that it was \u2014 wait for it \u2014 portable. Since I live alone (and in a fifth-floor walkup, no less), there was no way I was getting a traditional air conditioner, and I liked that this didn\u2019t require me to fit it through a window.\nIt\u2019s only 55 pounds, so it actually wasn\u2019t hard to carry up the stairs while in its box. Putting it together wasn\u2019t the easiest thing, but thanks to the instruction manual and YouTube, I was able to connect its air tube through my kitchen window, which was the hardest part.\nIt has three different modes: Cool, Dry, and Fan, and each can be controlled through the magnetic remote, which fits neatly on top of the machine. There\u2019s also a dehumidifier built in, so it\u2019s a two-in-one type of machine. While it doesn\u2019t cool my entire apartment, it keeps my kitchen/living room from turning into an inferno.\u201d \u2013 Holly J Coley, commerce updates editor\nOther AC brands to consider for portable conditioners are Black + Decker, which can double as a heater and an air conditioner, or Hisense, specifically designed for small rooms.\nDimensions: 15.16\u2033D x 13.98\u2033W x 24.8\u2033H | Btu Rating Options: 5,000-10,000 options | Cooling Area: Up to 14 feet | Weight: 55 pounds | Energy Efficiency Ratings: 6.1\nBest Ductless Air Conditioner: MRCOOL DIY 12k BTU 22 SEER Ductless Mini Split AC & Heat Pump\nPros:\n- Voted \u2018Best Overall\u2019 on Amazon for the ductless air conditioner system category\n- Comes with a 25-foot line set pre-charged with R-410A refrigerant and quick connectors for simple setup\n- Compatible with the Smart HVAC app for remote operation via smartphone or tablet\nCons:\n- Still requires drilling and mounting, which may be a barrier for some users despite the DIY label\nIdeal for spaces up to 500 square feet, this highly efficient single-zone heat pump system delivers both heating and cooling with a standout 22 SEER rating and Energy Star certification. Built for true do-it-yourself installation, it includes a pre-charged 25-foot line set with quick-connect fittings; no special tools or professional assistance is needed.\nCustomers are saying: \u201cVery easy to install. Great instructional videos from the QR code on the installation manual. Everything works as advertised and is definitely keeping our space as cool as we like.\u201d\nIf you have a great ductless system that\u2019s broken and needs a part, consider browsing Toshiba for replacement components before investing in a whole new AC unit. Toshiba is known for offering parts that can make repairing your existing system significantly more affordable.\nDimensions: 20.55\u2033D x 63.07\u2033W x 33.5\u2033H | Btu Rating Options: 22 | Cooling Area: 500 Square Foot | Weight: 109 pounds | Energy Efficiency Ratings: 22\nBest Budget Air Conditioner: Arctic Air Pure Chill 2.0 Evaporative Air Cooler by Ontel\nPros:\n- Features a space-saving and portable design that\u2019s simple to use\n- Operates on a max of 10 watts of power, so it\u2019s energy-efficient\n- Includes easy-touch controls for ergonomic use\nCons:\n- Some reviewers say the power cord could be of better quality\nIf you\u2019re on a budget and are desperate for anything to keep you cool, Ontel\u2019s Arctic Air Pure Chill 2.0 is a pretty nifty buy and super quiet. It has more than 18,000 pleasant reviews and is fit for your nightstand, dorm room or small space that needs a bit more breeze. Plus, over 8,000 units were sold last month and counting, thanks to this excellent price point.\nCustomers are saying: \u201cLove this little machine so much I bought two of them. I live on the coast, so we don\u2019t have air conditioning. It is great for the kitchen, where it becomes hotter than normal. This is a must-have for places that you need instant air conditioning.\u201d\nDimensions: n/a | Btu Rating Options: n/a| Cooling Area: 0.02 Cubic Feet Per Minute | Weight: 1.9 pounds | Energy Efficiency Ratings: n/a\nBest-Selling Portable Air Conditioner: Black+Decker Portable Air Conditioner with Remote Control\nPros:\n- Easy to assemble and install\n- Comes with a remote control and a top-mounted control panel with an LED display\n- If you upgrade to the 12,000 or 14,000 BTU, it also doubles as a heater\nCons:\n- Some reviewers say it\u2019s not completely quiet, but not a dealbreaker\nWith the most overall reviews on Amazon, we\u2019re not at all surprised Black+Decker\u2019s Portable Air Conditioner is the star of the show. With a remote control, an adjustable fan, and a win-win situation for being easy to clean and easy to install, we\u2019re just about ready to pick this one up.\nCustomers are saying: \u201cThis is a dependable, quiet, and effective unit that I trust enough to use in my toddler\u2019s bedroom. It cools her space evenly and keeps it comfortable for sleep, play, and everything in between. If you\u2019re looking for a portable air conditioner that delivers real peace of mind \u2014 especially for a child\u2019s room \u2014 this is the one to get. Highly recommended!\u201d\nDimensions: 14\u2033 D x 15.3\u2033 W x 24.8\u2033 H | Btu Rating Options: 8,000 to 14,000 | Cooling Area: n/a | Weight: n/a | Energy Efficiency Ratings: 6.2\nHow we tested\nWe tested each AC unit by evaluating its cooling performance in a controlled room, measuring how quickly it lowered the temperature and humidity. We monitored energy efficiency using a power consumption meter and assessed noise levels with a decibel meter at various settings.\nInstallation and ease of use were judged based on setup time and interface usability, including remote and smart features. We also examined build quality, design, and extra functions like timers and eco modes. Each unit was run for at least 50 hours to assess short-term reliability, and we considered user reviews to evaluate long-term performance.\nAn FAQ on Air Conditioners\nAhead, Shaunfield gives us the 411 on what you need to know about air conditioners before purchasing one for the season \u2014 including an overview of different types.\nWhat to look for in an air conditioner, according to an expert\nBefore shopping for a newly minted air conditioner, there are a few considerations to keep in mind before adding one to your cart. Above all else, shoppers need to consider what size room or house the air conditioner will be used for.\n\u201cAn easy way you can determine this is to check the square footage recommended for each appliance,\u201d Shaunfield told The Post. \u201cA \u2018small\u2019 square footage will be less than 250 sq ft., while rooms considered medium or large will range from 250-1,000 sq ft.\u201d\nAnother way to measure appropriate size, per Shaunfield, is considering the BTU of each unit \u2013 or British Thermal Unit \u2013 which measures how much energy your air conditioner is using to cool your room or home within an hour. \u201cAs the square footage of your room or home increases, so will the BTU needed to cool,\u201d he added.\nThe different types of air conditioners, explained by an expert\nBelow, Shaunfield explains each type of air conditioner you\u2019ll find on the market so you can find the one that best suits your space. The main types of air conditioners you will find include wall-mounted and window conditioners, portable conditioners, ductless mini-splits and central air conditioners.\n- Wall-mounted air conditioners & window air conditioners: These are permanent cooling solutions, in addition to central air. These are great options if you have areas of your home that aren\u2019t connected to the central A/C system.\n- Portable air conditioners: These work best in small spaces and provide you with the mobility to bring cool air where you need it most.\n- Ductless mini splits: These are a good choice for apartments or older buildings that require a retrofitted heating or cooling system, or any building whose construction doesn\u2019t have room for more traditional duct work.\n- Central air conditioning systems: These work to cool, heat and ventilate your entire home, while central air units merely cool your home. It\u2019s important to know that distinction and your preference may vary depending on where you live in the U.S. Places we trust for central air are Home Depot, Lowes and Walmart.\nWhy Trust Post Wanted by the New York Post\nFor over 200 years, the New York Post has been America\u2019s go-to source for bold news, engaging stories, in-depth reporting, and now, insightful shopping guidance. We\u2019re not just thorough reporters \u2013 we sift through mountains of information, test and compare products, and consult experts on any topics we aren\u2019t already schooled specialists in to deliver useful, realistic product recommendations based on our extensive and hands-on analysis. Here at The Post, we\u2019re known for being brutally honest \u2013 we clearly label partnership content, and whether we receive anything from affiliate links, so you always know where we stand. We routinely update content to reflect current research and expert advice, provide context (and wit) and ensure our links work.
