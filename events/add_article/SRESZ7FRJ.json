      "summary": "Upcoming U.S. jobs data will test investor confidence in imminent Fed rate cuts that have buoyed equity markets to record highs. Weak August employment could signal a slowing economy but may also prompt more aggressive cuts, while stronger data would likely keep the Fed on a cutting path. The market is also watching Fed policy developments, including political pressure on the central bank, which could widen tail risks. Meanwhile, tech stocks have been pressured by AI-related earnings, adding volatility to the S&P 500.",
