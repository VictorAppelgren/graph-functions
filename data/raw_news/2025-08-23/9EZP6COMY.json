  "content": "Waymo can now test its self-driving cars in New York City, Mayor Eric Adams has announced. Local authorities have granted the company the permit needed to be able to test autonomous vehicles in parts of Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. It's the first-ever permit for the \"testing deployment\" of AVs the city has granted. Waymo will be able to deploy a fleet with up to eight vehicles in the city until late September 2025. For now, though, the permit only allows Waymo to test its AVs with drivers behind the wheel.\n\nThe company announced earlier this year that it was going to test its driverless system in 10 new cities in 2025. In June, it filed a request for permission to test its AVs in New York City in hopes that it can someday bring its autonomous ride-hailing service to the Big Apple. To note, while Adams said the city granted Waymo the first permit of its kind, the company deployed its vehicles to map some parts of NYC back in 2021.\n\nUnder the permit, Waymo will be required to regularly report the data gathered from its testing to the Department of Transportation to certify that it's \"adhering to the industry\u2019s best practices related to cybersecurity.\" Waymo will be given the opportunity to apply for an extension after its pilot testing period ends in September. It may have to continue testing them with human operators for a while, though: New York state law prohibits the operation of vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, but Waymo told Forbes that it's lobbying to change the regulation.",

      "text": "Waymo to test its driverless system in ten new cities in 2025\nIt starts in San Diego and Las Vegas.\nWaymo is planning on bringing vehicles to ten new cities in 2025, according to a report by The Verge. This new testing phase starts in Las Vegas and San Diego. These won\u2019t be pure robotaxis, as they\u2019ll have a manual operator.\nIt\u2019s basically a small-scale experiment by the company to collect data and see how the self-driving system adapts to new locations, regional driving habits and unique weather patterns. All told, the company will be sending around ten vehicles to each new city. \u201cSo what we\u2019re looking for is places that are going to challenge our system and look very, very different,\u201d said Nick Rose, product manager for Waymo\u2019s expansion efforts.\nTo that point, Las Vegas is known for dense traffic and plenty of chaos surrounding drop-off zones near hotels and casinos. San Diego is similar to locations in which the Alphabet-owned company already operates, like Phoenix, but it wants to validate that the system performs well \u201cwithout having a ton of prior driving information.\u201d\nIt plans on bringing the service to Miami, along with Austin and Atlanta. Waymo hasn\u2019t announced the remaining cities, but the system sure could use more testing in some of the colder parts of the country. The company has done some winter testing in upstate New York and Michigan, but that's about it. It also recently announced it would start to test driverless cars in Tokyo, but we aren\u2019t sure if that counts as one of the ten new cities.\nIt\u2019s extremely important for the company to test in multiple cities. This is to account for unique traffic conditions and weather, of course, but also for inconsistencies that can trip up driverless systems. For instance, fire trucks and ambulances tend to look slightly different across cities and states. Waymo, after all, hasn\u2019t always had the best track record when it comes to emergency vehicles.\nThis is just the latest move to ensure that driverless cars are ready for primetime. The company recently started bringing its robotaxis onto Los Angeles highways."

      "text": "What you should know\n- Waymo Permitted to Begin Testing Autonomous Vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn with Trained Specialist Behind Wheel at All Times Under Nation\u2019s Strictest Safety Rules\nNEW YORK \u2013 New York City Mayor Eric Adams and New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez today announced that DOT has granted Waymo its first-ever permit to begin testing a limited number of autonomous vehicles (AV) in parts of Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn under the nation\u2019s strictest AV safety rules, including a requirement to have a trained AV-specialist behind the wheel at all times. Launched by the Adams administration last year, the city\u2019s robust safety requirements have been established for responsible and safe AV testing in New York City. The rigorous permitting program ensures all approved applicants are ready to safely and proficiently test their technology in the country\u2019s most dynamic and complex urban environment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a tech-friendly administration and we\u2019re always looking for innovative ways to safely move our city forward,\u201d said Mayor Adams. \u201cNew York City is proud to welcome Waymo to test this new technology in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as we know this testing is only the first step in moving our city further into the 21st century. As we continue to implement responsible innovation, we will always prioritize street safety.\u201d\n\u201cAs autonomous vehicle technology expands across the country, DOT has put in place comprehensive safety guidelines to ensure safe, responsible testing on our city\u2019s streets,\u201d said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. \u201cThese requirements will help ensure that the development of this technology is focused, first and foremost, on the safety of everyone who shares our busy city streets.\u201d\n\u201cWith over 10 million rides completed in five major U.S. cities and a strong safety record, we\u2019re proud to be working with leaders to lay the groundwork to bring this life saving technology to New Yorkers one day, beginning with receiving the first-ever permit issued in the city to drive autonomously,\u201d said Annabel Chang, head of U.S. state and local public policy, Waymo. \u201cWe believe it is essential for companies to collaborate directly with cities on the rollout of autonomous technology and are pleased to have reached this next step in New York City.\u201d\n\u201cRoadway safety for all New Yorkers is quite simply one of the most important issues today,\u201d said Paige Carbone, regional executive director, MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) New York. \u201cAutonomous vehicles hold the exciting promise of preventing deaths and injuries caused by behavioral factors, including impaired driving, if deployed responsibly and safely and in collaboration with the right community and city stakeholders. We welcome this next step for New Yorkers as Waymo receives the first permit of its kind.\u201d\nAssemblymember Brian Cunningham said, \"As sponsor of legislation on autonomous vehicles at the state level, I\u2019m encouraged to see New York City moving forward with testing that will show us how this technology can improve safety, reduce congestion, and expand mobility. This is the type of measured innovation that allows us to prepare for the future while making sure progress works for New Yorkers. The lessons learned here will help guide how we integrate autonomous technology statewide, which will help ensure it delivers real benefits in transportation, equity, and economic opportunity.\"\nAs part of their permit to operate within New York City, Waymo is required to coordinate closely with DOT through regular meetings and data reporting and Waymo must certify that they are adhering to the industry\u2019s best practices related to cybersecurity. In addition to receiving DOT approval, Waymo has also obtained necessary permits from the New York state Department of Motor Vehicles. Waymo will be permitted to test up to eight autonomous vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn until late September 2025. After the pilot testing period, Waymo will have the opportunity to apply for an extension to their pilot testing period. Finally, DOT\u2019s approval strictly relates to testing AV technology \u2014 the use of autonomous vehicles for for-hire service is currently prohibited by New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) rules, and any company providing for-hire service must comply with TLC rules, including by obtaining a TLC license.\n###"

      "text": "Topline\nWaymo secured a permit from New York City on Friday to test its autonomous vehicles on the city\u2019s streets, days after New Yorkers reported spotting some of Waymo\u2019s distinctive cars driving around Manhattan, though the vehicles had human drivers.\nKey Facts\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams announced the city\u2019s Department of Transportation gave Waymo a permit Friday to test up to eight autonomous vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September.\nDuring the testing period, a trained autonomous vehicle safety specialist must be sitting in the driver\u2019s seat at all times, according to Adams\u2019 statement.\nWaymo told TechCrunch it plans to start testing its autonomuos vehicles \u201cimmediately\u201d (Forbes has reached out to Waymo for comment).\nWaymo will be able to apply for an extension to its testing period once it expires.\nEarlier this week, New Yorkers reported seeing Waymo vehicles around Manhattan, though Waymo said in a statement to Forbes these vehicles would be manually powered by drivers until it secured the permit for its vehicles to drive autonomously.\nNew York\u2019s Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said in a statement the department has implemented \u201ccomprehensive safety guidelines to ensure safe, responsible testing on our city\u2019s streets.\u201d\nWaymo expanded to offer ridesharing services in Atlanta earlier this year, and has announced plans for expansion in Washington D.C., Miami, and Dallas.\nKey Background\nWaymo, an autonomous vehicle company and Alphabet company, first began offering driverless ridesharing services to all customers in Phoenix in 2020. It has since expanded to multiple cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Austin, where it competes with Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi service\u2014but largely remains the leader in the emerging industry so far. The company previously tested its vehicles in parts of Manhattan in 2021. New York\u2019s iconic yellow cab industry was devastated when rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft moved into the city. Now, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\u2019s annual report said there were 178,917 active licensed drivers in 2024, a number that includes both taxi drivers and for-hire vehicle drivers.\nSurprising Fact\nAlthough Waymo applied for a permit to operate autonomous vehicles, New York state law requires these vehicles to have a person present in the driver\u2019s seat at all times. Waymo told Forbes it was lobbying to change this regulation."

      "text": "Waymo will start operating in New York City\nThis will help Waymo test in heavy traffic and snow.\nMuch of Waymo's self-driving vehicle use has largely focused on warm climates, but it's about to give those machines a harsher trial. Waymo will start driving its autonomous Chrysler Pacifica vans in New York City on November 4th. This and a later wave of Jaguar I-Pace EVs will rely on human drivers to map streets and learn from the environment, and there aren't any immediate plans to offer driverless rides to passengers. However, Waymo clearly hopes to use this knowledge for its long-term autonomy goals in various cities.\nThe rollout will focus on Manhattan below Central Park (aka midtown and lower Manhattan), including the financial district and a portion of New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel. All tests will operate during daylight.\nThe dry run will help Waymo's Driver AI cope with New York City's notoriously heavy traffic, of course, but the company is particularly interested in weather testing. Like many northern cities, NYC has its fair share of ice and snow, both of which remain huge challenges for driverless cars. This test will give Waymo further opportunities to test its navigation in winter conditions, not to mention the heavy rainfall more common in the region.\nWaymo said it was \"encouraged\" by the responses from politicians, regulators, industry and non-profits. With that said, it's easy to see the potential for a backlash. NYC has been highly protective of its taxi business at times, and is heavily dependent on ridesharing. While fully driverless ride hailing services like Waymo One may not arrive for a long time in the city, taxi and rideshare operators alike likely won't be thrilled at the prospect of being replaced by autonomous systems."

      "text": "Waymo will start testing its autonomous cars in New York again\nActually running its self-driving taxi business in the city will be a bigger hurdle.\nWaymo's autonomous cars are heading back to New York City in July, the company announced today. Cars will be manually driven for now, not unlike the mapping tests Waymo ran in 2021, but the company says it ultimately wants to bring the same autonomous ride-hailing service it offers in San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles to NYC.\nNew York state law currently doesn't allow for the operation of a vehicle without a human driver, an obvious obstacle for a company like Waymo. As a bridge to offering its full service, Waymo says it's applied for a permit with the New York Department of Transportation to operate vehicles autonomously with a trained specialist behind the wheel. If NYC DOT approves the permit, the company says this will be the first \"testing deployment\" of autonomous vehicles in New York City.\nWaymo's previous excursion in New York was focused on navigating city traffic and dealing with icy and snowy weather. Each city the company enters presents a new challenge, but the places Waymo currently operates are primarily in drier, warmer climates. For now, getting the state and city onboard with autonomous vehicles seems like the larger issue.\nOutside of New York, Waymo continues to grow. The company recently expanded its service area around San Francisco and Los Angeles, came to Austin with the help of Uber in March and plans to either offer paid rides or test its self-driving system in several other cities over the next year."
