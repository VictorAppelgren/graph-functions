      "text": "- Nvidia readies Blackwell-based B30A and RTX6000D chips for China to skirt U.S. curbs and defend its 13% revenue share.\n- Analysts split: Bernstein sees shrinking China share, while Needham projects $20B sales by 2028 on Blackwell demand.\n- See the seasonal trading strategy that's beating the S&P 500 by 6X this year. Details here \u2192\nNvidia NVDA is pressing ahead with a China strategy that balances U.S. export restrictions with the need to defend market share in one of its most important regions.\nThe company is developing a new AI chip, tentatively called the B30A, built on its latest Blackwell architecture, Reuters reported on Tuesday.\nAccording to people briefed on the matter, the B30A will use a single-die design, delivering about half the raw computing power of the company\u2019s flagship dual-die B300 accelerator, but more potent than the H20 model Nvidia is currently allowed to sell in China.\nAlso Read: Beijing Asks Alibaba, ByteDance Why They Need Nvidia H20 Chips Instead Of Local Alternatives\nThe chip will include high-bandwidth memory and NVLink connectivity, both of which appear in the H20, a Hopper-based processor customized for the Chinese market.\nNvidia hopes to ship samples to Chinese customers for testing by September.\nChina accounted for 13% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in fiscal 2024. After an abrupt ban in April, Nvidia only regained permission to sell H20 in July.\nLast week, President Donald Trump signaled that his administration might allow Nvidia to sell scaled-down versions of its most advanced chips in China with 30% to 50% reductions in computing power.\nNVIDIA\u2019s stock gained 36% year-to-date as Big Tech giants like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL keep splurging on their AI ambitions, fueling demand for Nvidia processors.\nNvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD have already agreed to a deal requiring them to hand over 15% of revenue from advanced chip sales in China to the U.S. government.\nIn parallel, Nvidia is preparing to roll out another China-specific processor, the RTX6000D, which is also based on Blackwell but tuned for AI inference.\nThis chip will feature conventional GDDR memory and bandwidth capped at 1,398 GB/s, just under the 1.4 TB/s limit imposed by new U.S. rules. The RTX6000D will also be priced below the H20 and is scheduled for initial deliveries in September.\nAnalysts remain divided on Nvidia\u2019s outlook in China. Bernstein warned that U.S. export controls and the rise of local players like Huawei could shrink Nvidia\u2019s market share from 66% in 2024 to 54% in 2025, with China\u2019s AI chip localization ratio climbing to 55% by 2027.\nIn contrast, Needham\u2019s N. Quinn Bolton struck a bullish tone, projecting $3 billion in quarterly H20 shipments with near-100% margins on written-down inventory and forecasting $20 billion in China data center sales by fiscal 2028, supported by strong demand for upcoming Blackwell GPU variants.\nPrice Action: NVDA stock is trading higher by 0.33% to $182.61 premarket at last check Tuesday.\nRead Next:\nImage by El editorial via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Details here \u2192\nAlibaba Group BABA and its fintech affiliate Ant Group, co-founded by Jack Ma, have launched a unified strategy to take on Meituan MPNGY in China\u2019s instant commerce market.\nFor the first time since 2020, all of Alibaba\u2019s key businesses, including Taobao, Tmall, Alipay, Alibaba Cloud, food delivery service Ele.me, grocery chain Freshippo, and travel platform Fliggy, are aligning to create a coordinated force of delivery workers.\nAlibaba pledged to improve welfare for millions of riders, equipping them with new orange uniforms designed like racing suits and providing enhanced benefits, SCMP reported on Tuesday.\nAlso Read: Meituan Cries\u2019 Irrational!\u2019 As Alibaba Escalates Delivery Battle\nThe company committed funds for education and healthcare support for riders and their families.\nIn August, Ele.me briefly overtook Meituan\u2019s daily delivery volumes after offering customers free drinks with orders.\nAlibaba\u2019s pivot also reflects a broader strategic reset. Under CEO Jiang Fan, the company abandoned its plan to split into independent entities and instead consolidated its domestic and international e-commerce operations. It also introduced a new membership program integrating marketplaces, food delivery, and travel bookings, further binding consumers to its ecosystem.\nIn August, after regulators intervened, Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com JD pledged to halt aggressive price wars in China\u2019s $80 billion food delivery market.\nAlibaba\u2019s Ele.me promised to safeguard merchant margins, Meituan vowed to stop forcing subsidy programs, and JD committed to avoiding \u201cmalicious\u201d discounts.\nDespite the truce, analysts expect rivalry to persist under tighter controls, noting that months of $1 meals and billion-yuan subsidies drove market growth.\nSince March, Alibaba has already lost $100 billion in market value, and Goldman Sachs projects Ele.me could lose 41 billion yuan by mid-2026.\nStill, Alibaba stock is up 42% year-to-date, while JD.com is down 10%.

Investors paying 40x forward earnings know exactly what they\u2019re getting: a dominant player in AI with unmatched pricing power, scale, and ecosystem control.\nAhead of the company\u2019s August 27 earnings report, analysts at UBS and Wedbush expressed confidence in its AI-driven growth. They cited a powerful combination of surging AI infrastructure spending and renewed traction in key markets.\nAlso Read: Nvidia Prepares New China-Specific AI Chip To Defend Market Share\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri reaffirmed a Buy rating with a $205 price target, pointing to robust tailwinds supporting Nvidia\u2019s long-term growth. Wedbush\u2019s Matt Bryson went further, lifting his price target from $175 to $210 and reiterating an Outperform rating.\nBryson also raised his revenue and earnings forecasts, underscoring stronger-than-expected demand trends, a recovery in China beginning in the fiscal third quarter, and expanding hyperscale and neocloud spending through 2026.\nBryson emphasized that hyperscale capital expenditures rose 67% year over year in the second quarter, evidence that AI buildouts are accelerating and disproportionately benefiting Nvidia, which commands a dominant share of AI server value.\nHe noted that neocloud operators and AI model builders are set to sustain data center investments well into 2025, with further tailwinds expected in late 2025 and 2026 as long-term infrastructure projects come online.\nOn the product side, Bryson pointed to robust demand for Nvidia\u2019s B200 and GB200 GPUs, with supply occasionally unable to keep pace.\nHe highlighted growing expectations for NVL72 rack shipments in the second half of 2025, supported by bullish commentary from manufacturing partner Foxconn.\nIn China, server builds have rebounded sharply following U.S. licensing approvals for Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips, though policymakers in Beijing are simultaneously pushing domestic alternatives.\nLooking ahead, Bryson said GB300 server shipments remain on track for late third or early fourth quarter, while the transition to Blackwell Ultra chips is expected to proceed without major disruptions.\nHe also reaffirmed that early 2026 production of the Rubin architecture appears on schedule despite speculation of delays, underscoring confidence in Nvidia\u2019s execution.\nBased on these dynamics, Bryson lifted his fiscal 2027 EPS estimate to $6.10, arguing Nvidia\u2019s valuation is supported by its role at the center of global AI infrastructure expansion, with major projects underway in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Europe, and Asia.\nPrice Action: NVDA stock is trading lower by 0.03% to $175.37 at last check Thursday.\nRead Next:\nPhoto by Below the Sky via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
