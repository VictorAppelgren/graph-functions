  "content": "Queen Camilla was pictured beaming on Saturday while attending the final day of the Ebor Festival in York.\n\nThe royal, 78, a huge fan of horseracing, has been a patron of the racecourse since June 2024.\n\nCamilla is even believed to have interrupted her annual summer holiday in Balmoral with King Charles to attend the festival earlier this week.\n\nShe was pictured looking chic as she joined other racegoers on Thursday, the second day of the event, which ran from August 20-23.\n\nOnce again, the queen looked stylish during her appearance at the York venue on Saturday, donning a pale blue coat dress, featuring a v-neck.\n\nShe opted for a natural make-up look, with a dewy base, soft blush, and a pink lip.\n\nMeanwhile, her light blonde locks were worn loose, styled into loose waves, which fell beneath her large, pale cream straw hat.\n\nThe final touch to her stylish ensemble was jewellery, which she kept simple, sporting a pair of pearl earrings.\n\nIt comes after the royal attended the event on Thursday, during which she unveiled a plaque at the racecourse in celebration of the Juddmonte International race being named by the Longines World Racing Awards as the 'World's Best Race' of 2024.\n\nUpon her arrival that day, Camilla was met by Chris Legard, Vice Lord Lieutenant of North Yorkshire, Bridget Guerin, the Chairman of the York Race Committee, and William Derby, the Chief Executive of York Racecourse.\n\nShe was pictured smiling as she greeted the Lord Mayor of York, Councillor Martin Rowley BEM, and took the salute from the RAF Falcons display team at the start of the racing programme.\n\nThroughout the day, Camilla chatted to fellow racegoers and met representatives of local charities supported by York Racecourse.\n\nCamilla looked typically elegant during her appearance, donning a pale blue coat and a cream, wide-brimmed hat featuring a bow.\n\nShe took off her knee-length jacket to reveal a long-sleeved, floral dress in white, blue and red. Perfect for the bright day, it had puff sleeves and a pleated skirt.\n\nHer ensemble was accessorised with a striking necklace made up of four strings of pearls and diamonds as well as a pair of classic pearl earrings and several dainty bracelets in silver and gold.\n\nAnd the royal carried a beige, woven handbag by Italian fashion house Bottega Veneta, which matched her suede, pointed-toe kitten heels.\n\nAs patron, Camilla cut the ribbon to open the racecourse's new Bustardthorpe Development last year after the refurbishment of the 1913 Bustardthorpe Stand had been completed.\n\nShe was later taken on a tour of the grounds before taking her spot in the royal box, where she was seen holding a pair of binoculars and paying close attention to the races.\n\nThe Queen's love for horses echoes that of her mother-in-law, the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nCamilla has even reportedly taken over the day-to-day running of the late Queen's stables rather than King Charles.\n\nShe also has a life-long association with equestrian charities.\n\nAs the Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla supported the Ebony Horse Club, the British Equestrian Federation and the Brooke Hospital for Animals.\n\nIn 2013, she joined Queen Elizabeth II on a joint visit to the Ebony Horse Club in Brixton, south London, where children learn to ride in an urban setting.\n\nHer Majesty interrupted her summer holidays to attend the York event this year - leaving Balmoral Castle so she could watch the races.\n\nThere, she and King Charles have been joined by other members of the royal family in a tradition that has been continued since the estate was acquired by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1852.\n\nLast Friday, the royal couple were pictured together attending a service of remembrance marking 80 years since the end of the Second World War.\n\nThe Service of Remembrance at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire was organised by the Royal British Legion in what made for a moving tribute to war heroes.\n\nCharles and Camilla were moved to tears by the powerful first-hand testimony of VJ veterans as they spoke at the event.",
