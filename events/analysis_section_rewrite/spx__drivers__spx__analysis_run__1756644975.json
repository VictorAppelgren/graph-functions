      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions**  \nThe draft correctly identifies the Fed’s September 25‑bp cut and the July CPI as the primary drivers of a 0.5–1 % DXY rise over 3–6 months, and it cites the steepening 2‑yr/10‑yr spread (≈57 bp) as the key transmission mechanism. However, it drifts by tying mortgage‑rate dynamics to the dollar’s safe‑haven appeal—this is indirect and should be removed or rewritten to stay strictly on DXY. Tighten the base‑case horizon to 3–6 months (not “first quarter 2025”) and explicitly state the sign and magnitude: **dxy +0.5–1 %**. Add a concise causal chain: Fed cut → lower term premium → 57 bp 2‑yr/10‑yr steepening → higher real‑yield differential → DXY up. Include the risk factors (Fed hike, Treasury debt spike, flattening spread) and the catalyst window (Sept Fed meeting, early‑Aug CPI, Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP). Ensure every claim has an inline citation (B1KYJ1GPU, XTQIQRP5K, NIT6JFIQF, FAN5RYW6T, LF0UUL917, Z7O1DCHS7, 7XH2DKEKV). Remove the mortgage‑rate sentence or reframe it to explicitly link to DXY (e.g., “a 30‑yr yield rise would compress the dollar’s real‑yield advantage”). Finally, present the watch signals as a short list tied to the catalyst window, keeping the paragraph focused and action‑oriented.",
