  "content": "Angelina Jolie is looking for a new home outside of the U.S., according to a report.\n\nThe Maria star, 50, is considering \u201cseveral locations abroad\u201d to move to, People reports, citing an \u201cexclusive source.\u201d The news comes after rumblings earlier this week suggested that she was preparing her L.A. home to be listed for sale.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to a representative for Jolie for comment.\n\nThe news that Jolie will move \u201cabroad\u201d comes after an exodus of several celebrities who\u2019ve left the country to escape America under Donald Trump, including Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres. Jimmy Kimmel revealed this week that he\u2019s flirting with the idea of leaving, when he said he\u2019d obtained citizenship in Italy.\n\nBut Jolie has reportedly wanted to leave Los Angeles for some time, and for reasons unrelated. She told The Hollywood Reporter last year that she only remained in the city \u201cbecause I have to from a divorce.\u201d\n\nJolie filed for divorce from Pitt in 2016, and the pair only reached a finalization in December. They share six children including 17-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, Maddox Chivan, 24, Pax Thien, 21, Zahara Marley, 20, Shiloh Nouvel, 19.\n\nJolie explained at the time that her family is all that\u2019s keeping her in Los Angeles. \u201cI grew up in this town,\u201d she said. \u201cI am here because I have to be here from a divorce, but as soon as they\u2019re 18, I\u2019ll be able to leave. When you have a big family, you want them to have privacy, peace, safety. I have a house now to raise my children, but sometimes this place can be\u2026that humanity that I found across the world is not what I grew up with here.\u201d\n\nJolie added that when she can finally leave L.A., \u201cI\u2019ll spend a lot of time in Cambodia. I\u2019ll spend time visiting my family members wherever they may be in the world.\u201d",

      "text": "Brad Pitt has finally commented on his messy split from ex-wife Angelina Jolie.\nThe Fight Club star gave a very nonchalant reaction about his recently finalized divorce with Jolie in a GQ magazine article published Wednesday.\nWhen asked by reporter Daniel Riley if anything felt different \u201cbeing on the other side of the divorce finally being finalized,\u201d or if he felt any \u201crelief,\u201d the actor gave a short and blunt answer.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it was that major of a thing. Just something coming to fruition. Legally,\u201d Pitt said.\nAlthough Pitt doesn\u2019t think it was anything \u201cmajor,\u201d he and Jolie\u2019s relationship has been tabloid fodder since he divorced Jennifer Aniston in 2005 after meeting Jolie on the set of the movie Mr. & Mrs. Smith.\nPitt\u2019s nonchalant response to his second divorce is likely no surprise to Aniston, who famously said after their split that while she would always love him, Pitt had \u201ca sensitivity chip that\u2019s missing.\u201d\nPitt\u2019s second divorce was even more intense with legal battles spanning almost eight years following Jolie\u2019s decision to file for divorce in 2016, claiming Pitt was abusive to her and their six children.\nAccording to her lawsuit against Pitt, he allegedly \u201cchoked\u201d one of their children and \u201cstruck another in the face\u201d before turning on Jolie.\nThe couple never addressed these allegations legally, Jolie declining to press charges against him. The pair officially finalized their divorce in December.\n\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family,\u201d Jolie\u2019s lawyer, James Simon, told People in December.\n\u201cThis is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago,\u201d he added. \u201cFrankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\u201d\nThe couple had been together for 12 years and married for two of them.\nPitt, on his part, is now dating Ines de Ramon, and the pair made their first public appearance together at the 2024 British Grand Prix in July of last year.\nBut the Academy Award-winning actor told GQ that he laments how his \u201cpersonal life is always in the news.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been in the news for 30 years, bro. Or some version of my personal life, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an annoyance I\u2019ve had to always deal with in different degrees, large and small, as I do the things I really want to do. So, it\u2019s always been this kind of nagging time suck or waste of time, if you let it be that,\u201d Pitt added.\nIn general, though, he admitted that his \u201clife is fairly contained.\u201d\n\u201cIt feels pretty warm and secure with my friends, with my loves, with my fam, with my knowledge of who I am, that, you know, it\u2019s like this fly buzzing around a little bit.\u201d\nPitt just finished wrapping up filming his upcoming movie F1, which is about Formula One racing. The film will be available to watch in theaters in June."

      "text": "Angelina Jolie Opens Up About \u2018Maria,\u2019 Her Operatic Life and Her Bold Return\nAfter her self-imposed hiatus from filmmaking and a turbulent period in her own saga, the elusive actress sits down with THR to discuss her reemergence, her portrayal of tempestuous diva Maria Callas and her own movie about trauma and survival: \u201cI\u2019m a very deeply feeling person and kind of a raw nerve.\u201d\nAngelina Jolie enters her mahogany-paneled dining room in Los Feliz in a gauzy white sundress and slides, carrying a pot of herbal tea, three large dogs trailing behind her. It\u2019s mid-August, and Jolie is about to do something she hasn\u2019t done in years\u2014travel to a bunch of film festivals to promote her movies. Maria, the Pablo Larra\u00edn biopic in which she plays opera\u2019s defining diva, Maria Callas, is set to premiere in Venice, Telluride and New York; Without Blood, the war drama she wrote and directed from Alessandro Baricco\u2019s 2002 novel, will be at the Toronto Film Festival, where she\u2019ll be honored with a tribute award Sept. 8. Netflix will release Maria in the U.S., Without Blood is seeking a distributor, and both films mark a return to the prestige movie business for Jolie, 49, after years of focusing primarily on being a mother to her six children, who now range in age from 16 to 23. Her last film as a director was 2017\u2019s First They Killed My Father and most recent as an actor was the 2021 Marvel movie Eternals.\nThe film projects are personal in ways that are almost uncomfortable to discuss, with Maria \u2014 for which Jolie spent more than six months learning to sing, breathe and walk like the mercurial soprano \u2014 a portrait of an icon imprisoned by her own image. The movie is set in Paris in 1977, in the final days of Callas\u2019 life, when she is trying to sing again after years away from a stage, for a public that had booed her when they didn\u2019t like the sound of her voice and branded her a \u201ctigress\u201d for her temperament. Larra\u00edn says that, like Callas, \u201cAngelina has an enormous amount of mystery. I thought she could play this woman who is looking to find her own identity.\u201d\nWithout Blood, which stars Salma Hayek Pinault and Demi\u00e1n Bichir as two people linked by a traumatic event in their youth, is a return to a subject Jolie repeatedly mines as a filmmaker: the impact of conflict (in this case, one that is never specified). It\u2019s a subject of intense interest to her as a mother and an advocate who has traveled to refugee camps and war zones.\nJolie\u2019s home is a lushly landscaped beaux arts mansion built for Cecil B. DeMille that she bought after her 2016 separation from Brad Pitt in a highly contentious, headline-fueling divorce that is still ongoing. A towering tree house in the yard is a sign of the family she has raised within its wrought-iron gates. She built the tree house too high, she says, because \u201cI\u2019ve never been afraid of heights.\u201d\nHaving now made two films so intimate to her own experiences, Jolie is figuring out how she wants to talk about them. She declines to discuss Pitt, or talk about 20-year-old son Pax\u2019s recent e-bike accident, other than to say he is recovering. Over the course of the long afternoon, while her dogs snore softly at her feet, the actress will open up with bracing candor around some subjects \u2014 like the quite literal rediscovery of her own voice \u2014 and draw firm boundaries around others. In the old Hollywood, Jolie says, \u201cYou could have this messy private process and the work spoke. Now, the audience\u2019s relationship is different. I\u2019m trying to get used to what to share.\u201d\nYou have a packed schedule heading off to the festivals. Having finished these two films, are you able to take in the moment?\nI am often not. I was an artist early to just help my mom pay bills. I\u2019ve had times where I\u2019ve loved being an artist, and I\u2019ve had times where I felt very, very far away from being comfortable in the business. I\u2019m hoping to be able to have a new relationship with it.\nWhat brought you to Maria Callas\u2019 story?\nJust give me a moment, because this is my first time talking about her. I kind of stepped away. It was so intense and then I stepped away and I haven\u2019t sung or talked about her since. Which doesn\u2019t always happen to me, but this one really kind of took me. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot that will be read into it of our overlaps as women, but the one that\u2019s maybe not the most obvious is I\u2019m not sure how comfortable we both are with being public. And there was a pressure behind the working that wasn\u2019t just the joy of the work.\nAnd yet I do love to create, she does love to sing, but sometimes there are all these other things that take that joy away and change the experience of that. It was quite hard, what she went through. People were quite aggressive when she wasn\u2019t able to be what they wanted her to be. They were very unkind, and she carried a lot of trauma and she worked very, very hard. I just began to really care about her and wanted that aspect of the story to be told.\nIn the beginning, [singing] was just survival for her. \u201cThis is what you should do to keep [the family] safe or make us money. This is what we want of you and what we expect of you.\u201d Her approach to her music is, she said, that you find the piece of work and you just study and study and study, and you do it exactly as the composer wrote it. You add nothing. You don\u2019t feel in it. You do the work with precision as you\u2019re told, and then you breathe life into it and find it.\nHow does that compare to how you prepare as an actor?\nI don\u2019t know what it is that I do. I used to joke that I started flying lessons when I felt like I needed a practical skill because my skill was just being emotional. That was before I directed, but it was kind of like, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d For me, if somebody laughs or relates, then it feels like a way of communicating with other people. And I think she experienced that, too. I think that\u2019s why it hurt her so much when she was shut out and attacked.\nIn the first scene where Maria is rehearsing with the piano player after not performing for so many years, you\u2019re about to open your mouth to start singing and a remarkable, dark look crosses your face. What is it that you were thinking in that moment?\nDo you want to know all my private secrets?\nIs that a private secret?\nI\u2019m making her pain personal to me, and that is certainly very private. It took many months of singing classes. Months of just getting the singing down and then the Italian classes and then the voice and doing all these things like her. You try to be precise. I would recommend almost every human being take an opera class. To exist and never have sung with your full body as loud as you could possibly sing \u2014 it\u2019s something I think we should all feel. It\u2019s scary, and it is rarely asked of us. It\u2019s rarely asked of us in life to be all that we can be or feel all that we feel.\nQuite the contrary. We\u2019re told to tamp it down all day long.\nExactly. My first class, I cried. I was sad, I was scared. It was a strange physical body reaction. I stood there, and [the instructor] said, \u201cOK, just be in your body. Take a deep breath, let it all out and just open your mouth and just let that sound come from the inside.\u201d And that\u2019s when I became really emotional. You discover how much we lock our pain in our bodies. Our voice gets tight, our shoulders go high, we get stomach aches, we do all these things, and it\u2019s a protection for us. The hardest thing was feeling again and breathing again and opening again in the way that this film required that I had really not done for quite a while. So maybe what you saw on my face was the feeling. To have to feel everything, what she had to do on that stage \u2026 it requires your whole heart, body and mind, opera. And you can\u2019t do it halfway.\nYou aren\u2019t really a halfway person. There is some parallel with you and Maria Callas there. Have you always been someone who doesn\u2019t just dip your toe in the pool? You dive in.\nI think my failure is, I don\u2019t know how to do the other. I really don\u2019t. And many times I wish I did. I wish I knew how to be still and calm. I\u2019m propelled forward constantly, and it\u2019s not always the best feeling. For better or for worse, I\u2019m a very deeply feeling person and kind of a raw nerve. So when I feel something deeply, I jump. I feel alive or I connect to something true inside myself. I think we all have times in our life where we\u2019re really in tune with who we really are. And we all know those times. And usually if we listen to ourselves in those times, our path gets clearer and clearer. And when we make decisions when we are in fear or being pressured, we take a very different path. And it can be very destructive.\nWhat was it like shooting at La Scala, the opera house located in Milan?\nIt was an out-of-body experience because I don\u2019t sing. I had somebody in my life who was not kind to me about singing. It was a relationship I was in. And so I just assumed I couldn\u2019t really sing. I\u2019d been to theater school, so it was weird that it even had an effect on me. I just kind of adapted to this person\u2019s opinion. So it took me getting past a lot of things to start singing. And discovering also that I was a soprano. I thought I had a low voice my whole life. I was explaining [to the singing instructor] that my voice is deeper, and he said, \u201cNo, you\u2019re actually a soprano.\u201d And probably something happened. Your voice changes when you go through different things in your life. So that was a shock. That was very strange.\nSo learning to sing and to enjoy singing, I was very, very shy stepping through this whole process. Pablo [Larra\u00edn] started the shoot with the super close-up that opens the film, because we could clear the room. My boys [sons Maddox and Pax] were there, but there was hardly anybody in there because the thing with singing opera is, you have to be loud. God knows how many lozenges I had, and I was rehearsing all night, all morning. I was very nervous to begin. I didn\u2019t want to disappoint the crew. We were in a theater or church in Greece. I thought, \u201cOh, who\u2019s outside? Can they hear me on the street?\u201d We would get through that, and then it would be, \u201cOK, now you have to have a few more crewmembers for the wider shot, now the audience has to start to come in.\u201d And it grew and grew and grew until we were at La Scala. La Scala was the one everything was building toward. That was going to require the whole crew, the entire audience. It was so beyond my comfort zone that I was giddy. There was nothing else to do except to jump, to just fully jump. The final layer on that particular performance was what I am comfortable with, the emotional performance of her pain and her madness.\nDo you have a way of shaking that off at the end of the workday \u2014 that stress or intensity?\nI\u2019ve been a parent for 23 years. The most beautiful thing about being a parent is that you are not the center of your life. So you are leaving set, focused on something for someone. That\u2019s your real life. Your real world. And that always is the majority of who you are.\nI have never had a set where my family is not allowed to be there because I\u2019m focusing \u2014 I\u2019m not that person. You can climb all over me or visit. It really meant a lot that my boys were with me on Maria. When I would have really heavy times, they would come over and just give me a hug or a cup of tea. That was probably one of the more intense things was that \u2014usually when I\u2019m expressing that much pain, it\u2019s not in front of my children. You really try to hide from your children how much pain and sadness you carry. And so for them to be with you when you\u2019re expressing it at such a level, I think it was the first time they ever heard me cry like that. That\u2019s usually for the shower.\nMaddox and Pax were working on the crew in some capacity, weren\u2019t they?\nRight. Mad and Pax were on this one. Doing AD [assistant directing] work. They\u2019ve done that quite a few times, and I think that\u2019s good for them. Pax tends to do stills and he gets brought in, and Pablo was wonderful and recognized that he was good at it.\nWhy had you waited so long since you last acted or directed?\nI needed to be home more with my kids.\nAnd what made you feel ready to return to work?\nThey\u2019re a bit older, getting more independent. I\u2019m less needed and so able to go away for different periods of time. And they\u2019re old enough to join me at work. It\u2019s a new season in our lives. I\u2019m very excited for them to be coming into their own more and more every day.\nWhat was it that drew you to the book Without Blood?\nI love writers who understand the complexities of human beings and don\u2019t try to explain them or wrap them up in a nice little bow, which may be what some people will have a hard time with in this film, because it doesn\u2019t fully answer everything. But part of what conflict does to people and how damaging conflict is, especially to children, is that it bleeds into all aspects of your life. And you see how it\u2019s affected both of these people.\nMost of my films are what would be considered war films or films about conflict and war and often history. The first film I did [as a director, 2011\u2019s In the Land of Blood and Honey], I wrote trying to understand the war in Yugoslavia. A lot of people in that particular conflict were friends and lovers and neighbors, and then they would come head-to-head and become enemies and be divided. And so I wrote a story with what would happen if, in the beginning, these people have every chance of being happy and in love and having a family and all. And in the end, one kills the other. How does this happen? [Without Blood] in a way is a final chapter. I\u2019ve been through the wars. I\u2019ve been through Louis Zamperini in a prison camp [in 2014\u2019s Unbroken]. I\u2019ve been through a child at war when it\u2019s not an outside enemy, but an enemy in your own country [2017\u2019s First They Killed My Father].\nWhy is conflict a subject that you return to?\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time in conflict zones, and I suppose it\u2019s where I have seen the best of humanity and the absolute worst. I never intended to make films about war, but I just spent many years with people displaced from war and continue to work with them, and I have my home in Cambodia. My neighbors have been through war and many of my closest friends. I suppose it\u2019s just a large part of what it is to be human, to understand why we do this to each other and how we get through it. I\u2019ve never had to experience war or lose somebody through armed conflict. But I have people I care very deeply about who have. I\u2019ve seen people who have nothing give everything. And I\u2019ve seen people who have everything do nothing.\nIt\u2019s not always about why these horrible things happen. It really is a lot about how people get through them. And the kind of people I love and admire most in the world are the people who keep their grace after all of the harm done to them. I think I find those people the most moving, and I admire them.\nThis film is a non-specific place, right? A non-specific war?\nThat was intentional. The writer wrote it to say, this could be anywhere. OK, now [the war] is all over and here we sit and did it add up to anything? Did it change the world? Was there a winner? What has it done to our lives?\nHow did you approach writing the adaptation?\nI tried to stick really close to the book. So much so that the writer actually said to me, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get this made. They will try to force you to change the end. They will try to force you to define a place and time.\u201d\nDo you have any writing rituals, a particular place in your home or time of day you like to write?\nI usually write when everyone is asleep so I can focus.\nHow do you walk the line between being an artist and being someone who has a voice that people listen to on certain political issues?\nI am not an artist first, I\u2019m a mom. And I\u2019m somebody who has tried to have a better education on foreign policy. I think of the amount of times it\u2019s been summarized, \u201cYou\u2019re an artist, but you also use your voice,\u201d you feel like, that\u2019s just being a person. I\u2019m trying to understand what is happening within our world, why so many things are the way they are. I\u2019m trying to understand how to best be a guide for my children, to make sure that they are good people. I don\u2019t often feel like I\u2019m doing enough. So when you say, \u201cYou use your voice,\u201d I feel like there are so many things I don\u2019t quite know how to do or say at this time.\nWhen your kids are grown, will you stay in L.A.?\nI grew up in this town. I am here because I have to be here from a divorce, but as soon as they\u2019re 18, I\u2019ll be able to leave. When you have a big family, you want them to have privacy, peace, safety. I have a house now to raise my children, but sometimes this place can be \u2026 that humanity that I found across the world is not what I grew up with here. [After Los Angeles,] I\u2019ll spend a lot of time in Cambodia. I\u2019ll spend time visiting my family members wherever they may be in the world.\nThe public, we feel like we know you. Maybe we\u2019ve gone through something you\u2019ve gone through and talked about publicly \u2014 breast cancer, the loss of your mother. What is it like to have people express those connections to you?\nIt\u2019s one of the nicest things \u2014 maybe the only nice thing \u2014 about being a public person, your connection with other people. I realized when I came into this business, doing things like Gia or Girl, Interrupted, and I expressed so much of my madness and my pain. When people connected to it, I felt less alone. So if somebody were to talk to me about having gone through breast cancer or losing their parent, then I feel more deeply connected with another human being. To go into a room full of people you don\u2019t know, and have a lot in common very quickly because somehow you\u2019ve been in their home on the television or you made their children laugh or they know something personal, that\u2019s really nice.\nMay I ask what the status of your divorce is?\nNo.\nWhat do you do when you\u2019re kicking back? At my house, I order Thai food and watch bad TV, and I wonder what your version of that is.\nIf somebody wants to watch bad TV and order Thai food, I\u2019m the first one to put the fuzzy socks on and sit next to them. I like to be with people I love. I\u2019m not somebody begging to be alone. I\u2019m not that person that feels like, \u201cOh, I wish I could just be alone so I could have my guilty pleasures.\u201d Because usually my guilty pleasure is being with somebody. I love doing something that makes them happy. That really does make me happy.\nWho do you feel are your close friends? Who is the person you call at 3 in the morning?\nI don\u2019t really have those kinds of relationships. Maybe it\u2019s losing your parent young. Maybe it\u2019s working. Maybe it\u2019s being somebody who\u2019s been betrayed a lot. I don\u2019t have a lot of those warm, close relationships as much that I lean on. But I have a few, and a few is enough. Loung [Ung, the Cambodian American human rights activist who is the subject of First They Killed My Father] is one of my closest friends. My mother was very close to me. I lost her. I\u2019ve had a few friends over the years not be there for my family in their hour of need. I have a couple of people that I trust. What did Maria Callas die with? Two trusted people.\nWhat do you still want to do professionally?\nThere are some bigger directing projects that would take longer that I haven\u2019t been able to do. The one sitting at my desk now, a big epic that\u2019s on my mind, the wonderful story of [British photojournalist] Don McCullin. In many ways, it\u2019s about the rise and fall of journalism. Don\u2019s an extraordinary man. He\u2019s still around, and he\u2019s become a friend and he\u2019s amazing in what he\u2019s seen. I would love to spend time and trace his steps and maybe learn more. I\u2019m a terrible student. If I have to just read something, I don\u2019t get it at all. But if I experience it or meet somebody and it\u2019s personal, then I understand. I also still want to play a villain.\nWhat about Maleficent? She\u2019s a villain.\nShe\u2019s a good guy. My villains end up being good guys. I suppose every villain is usually just someone in pain. To be honest, it would be nice to just do something maybe a little lighter. So my children can hear me laugh a little more. As an artist, there\u2019s a part of me that thinks I would like to find a way to do something that would make people smile.\nThis story appears in the Sept. 4 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

      "text": "Jimmy Kimmel might be the next American comedian to flee to Europe to escape President Donald Trump.\nKimmel, who has hosted the ABC late-night comedy show Jimmy Kimmel Live! for 22 years, shared his thoughts on Trump and the state of American politics with his ex-girlfriend, Sarah Silverman, on her podcast.\n\u201cA lot of people I know are thinking about where are they going to get citizenship?\u201d Silverman said.\n\u201cI did get Italian citizenship,\u201d Kimmel replied.\nAccording to the Italian news agency Ansa, Kimmel obtained Italian citizenship this year after proving his ancestral lineage. Kimmel\u2019s maternal great-grandparents emmigrated to New York from Naples after an earthquake devastated their hometown, Ischia, in 1883.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on is as bad as you thought it was gonna be,\u201d Kimmel remarked to Silverman, referring to Trump\u2019s second term.\n\u201cWay worse,\u201d Silverman chimed in.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much worse; it\u2019s just unbelievable,\u201d Kimmel agreed. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s probably even worse than he would like it to be.\u201d\nIn obtaining Italian citizenship, Kimmel joins other celebrities who have taken steps to flee the country or have already done so, including Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres, who fled to Ireland and England, respectively.\nKimmel is a public critic of MAGA and has regularly criticized Trump, most recently over the president\u2019s trade war. After a hiccup in the stock market, Kimmel accused Trump of causing stress on the stock market to \u201cdistract us from all the other horrible stuff.\u201d\nHe later joined the chorus of TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) jokes\u2014a nickname Wall Street executives have given Trump for his flip-flopping on tariffs. \u201cHow does it feel to be on the other end of the nickname game?\u201d Kimmel said on his show, \u201cNot great, does it?\u201d\nKimmel has also coined his own nicknames for Donald and Melania Trump: Don Valjean and Lady Mis\u00e9rable.\nIn late June, Trump celebrated CBS\u2019 decision to cancel Stephen Colbert\u2019s show, The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, and warned Kimmel that he was next on the chopping block.\n\u201cNext up will be an even less talented Jimmy Kimmel, and then, a weak, and very insecure, Jimmy Fallon. The only real question is, who will go first?\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\nKimmel fired back with an Instagram post referencing Trump\u2019s friendship with convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing you\u2019re next. Or maybe it\u2019s just another wonderful secret,\u201d Kimmel wrote, a reference to a line in a letter to Epstein that Trump has denied writing that expresses hope that \u201cevery day be another wonderful secret.\u201d\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Kimmel\u2019s team for comment.\nFellow comedians O\u2019Donnell and DeGeneres fled for greener pastures after learning that Trump had won the election in 2024. O\u2019Donnell has been engaged in multiple spats with the president and told CNN, \u201cI knew after reading Project 2025 that if Trump got in, it was time for me and my non-binary child to leave the country.\u201d\n\u201cWe got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis,\u201d DeGeneres told broadcaster Richard Bacon, according to BBC. \u201cAnd we\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re staying here.\u2019\u201d"

      "text": "Ellen DeGeneres has revealed how a short stay in the U.K. unexpectedly turned into a permanent move after President Donald Trump was elected.\nThe talk show host said she and her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, originally planned to spend at most a third of the year in the English countryside after purchasing a home there in 2024.\nBut the morning after the U.S. presidential election, the \u201cpart-time house\u201d transformed into their full-time refuge.\n\u201cWe got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, \u2018He got in,\u2019\u201d DeGeneres told broadcaster Richard Bacon at an event on Sunday, according to BBC. \u201cAnd we\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re staying here.\u2019\u201d\nDeGeneres, whose talk show ended after almost 20 years in 2022 amid accusations that she fostered a toxic workplace environment, said life \u201cis just better\u201d in the U.K.\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely beautiful,\u201d she said in what was her first public appearance since moving across the pond. \u201cWe\u2019re just not used to seeing this kind of beauty. The villages and the towns and the architecture\u2014everything you see is charming and it\u2019s just a simpler way of life.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s clean. Everything here is just better\u2014the way animals are treated, people are polite. I just love it here.\u201d\nDeGeneres and de Rossi recently traded the $18 million mansion in south-central England that they moved into in November for a similarly priced estate close by, according to Daily Mail.\nJust before making the move to England, DeGeneres reportedly sold her Carpinteria, California home for $96 million. In March, she reportedly sold her bungalow in Montecito, Calif. for $5.2 million.\nDespite seeking refuge from the Trump administration, Vice President J.D. Vance is reportedly planning a vacation to her new neighborhood this August.\nDeGeneres, who once said Trump was \u201cagainst everything that I stand for,\u201d cheered on fellow comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell, who also fled America in the wake of the 2024 election, in her recent clash with the president.\n\u201cGood for you,\u201d DeGeneres captioned a carousel of screenshots showing the now-Ireland-based O\u2019Donnell firing back against the president\u2019s threats.\nDeGeneres, who came out as gay in 1997, said that she and de Rossi were considering getting married again in the U.K. and slammed efforts to ban gay marriage again in the U.S.\n\u201cI wish we were at a place where it was not scary for people to be who they are. I wish that we lived in a society where everybody could accept other people and their differences,\u201d she said.\nDeGeneres also spoke about claims that she was \u201cmean\u201d\u2014a label that stuck after ex-employees described The Ellen DeGeneres Show as a \u201ctoxic workplace\u201d in 2020. Three senior producers were fired and DeGeneres made an apology before the show was taken off the air.\n\u201cIt\u2019s as simple as, I\u2019m a direct person, and I\u2019m very blunt, and I guess sometimes that means that... I\u2019m mean?\u201d she said, adding that it was \u201ckind of crazy\u201d that saying someone is mean \u201ccan be the worst thing that you say about a woman\u201d.\n\u201cHow dare us have any kind of mood, or you can\u2019t be anything other than nice and sweet and kind and submissive and complacent,\u201d she continued.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can say anything that\u2019s ever going to get rid of that [reputation] or dispel it, which is hurtful to me. I hate it. I hate that people think that I\u2019m that because I know who I am and I know that I\u2019m an empathetic, compassionate person.\u201d"

Kennedy Jr. ranting about what he calls the autism \u201cepidemic.\u201d\n\u201cThese are kids who will never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date, many of them will never use a toilet unassisted,\u201d Kennedy said in regards to children with severe autism.\nO\u2019Donnell, whose child was diagnosed with autism at 2-years-old, called Kennedy out on his \u201cdisgraceful, dehumanizing remarks,\u201d calling him \u201cabsolutely deplorable\u201d and saying that he should resign or be released from his position.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very disrespectful, I think it\u2019s disgraceful and I think he is wholly unqualified to be the head of health and human services,\u201d she said.\nShe added: \u201cI think most of the cabinet picks that Donald Trump has made are part of his vision of a reality show government and not the most qualified people available, especially Robert Kennedy.\u201d\nO\u2019Donnell has been a longtime critic of Donald Trump, and the two have been at each other\u2019s necks since O\u2019Donnell first became a host on The View in 2006.\nThe president called O\u2019Donnell a \u201cwoman out of control\u201d after the former talk show host called him out on The View for being the \u201cmoral authority\u201d around the 2006 Miss USA\u2019s controversy about underage drinking and substance use.\n\u201cHe annoys me on a multitude of levels. [He] left the first wife, had an affair, left the second wife, had an affair, had kids both times, but he\u2019s the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America,\u201d she said on the 2006 episode. \u201cDonald, sit and spin, my friend. I don\u2019t enjoy him.\u201d\nThe two continued their back-and-forth over the years on X; Trump calling O\u2019Donnell a \u201ctrue loser\u201d after she announced her engagement to Michelle Rounds in 2011.\nIn March, Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s boyfriend, who works for Real America\u2019s Voice, had asked Ireland Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin during his White House visit why he let the comedian into Ireland.\nMartin didn\u2019t appear to be familiar with O\u2019Donnell, and the president assured him that he was \u201cbetter off not knowing her.\u201d"
