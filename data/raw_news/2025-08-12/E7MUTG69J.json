The company has continued to benefit from its positioning in the data-driven AI networking boom. Its revenues for the quarter came in at $2.2 billion, up 30.4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. This figure beat the Street\u2019s expectations by 4.3%. Moreover, the company has also observed a notable expansion in gross margins, leading to a solid growth in earnings.\n\nArista\u2019s adjusted net income for the quarter soared 37.3% year-over-year to $923.5 million, and its adjusted EPS of $0.73 surpassed the consensus estimates by 11.7%, boosting investor confidence.\n\nFor the full fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts expect ANET to report an adjusted EPS of $2.41, up 17% year-over-year. Further, the company has a robust earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street\u2019s bottom-line projections in each of the past four quarters.\n\nThe stock has a consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating overall. Of the 23 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 16 \u201cStrong Buys,\u201d two \u201cModerate Buys,\u201d and five \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is slightly more optimistic than a month ago, when 15 analysts gave \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendations and the stock had a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating overall.\n\nOn Aug. 7, Barclays (BCS) analyst Tim Long reiterated an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on ANET and raised the price target from $119 to $151.",
