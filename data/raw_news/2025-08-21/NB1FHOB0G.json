  "description": "New York state law still requires autonomous vehicles to have a human behind the wheel.",
  "content": "New Yorkers have been spotting Waymos\u2014with their distinctive, rotating laser sensors on top\u2014driving across Manhattan as the autonomous vehicle company tests in the nation\u2019s largest city, though they will still have human drivers for the foreseeable future. A Waymo vehicle in San Francisco. New York state law still requires autonomous vehicles to have a human behind the wheel.\n\n\u201cWe have every intention of bringing our fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future,\u201d Waymo said in a statement to Forbes, noting these vehicles would be manually operated by drivers as the company waits for the results of a permit application to operate autonomously. Waymo expanded to offer ridesharing services in Atlanta earlier this year, and has announced plans for expansion in Washington D.C., Miami, and Dallas. Since announcing an NYC test in June, the company posted a photo of a testing car in July, and New Yorkers in recent days have started capturing images and videos of the white cars equipped with sensors on the streets of Greenwich Village, Chelsea, and Long Island City.\n\nWaymo, an autonomous vehicle company and Alphabet company, first began offering driverless ridesharing services to all customers in Phoenix in 2020. It has since expanded to multiple cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Austin, where it competes with Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi service\u2014but largely remains the leader in the emerging industry so far. The company previously tested its vehicles in parts of Manhattan in 2021. New York\u2019s iconic yellow cab industry was devastated when rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft moved into the city. Now, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\u2019s annual report said there were 178,917 active licensed drivers in 2024, a number that includes both taxi drivers and for-hire vehicle drivers.\n\nAlthough Waymo applied for a permit to operate autonomous vehicles, New York state law requires these vehicles to have a person present in the driver\u2019s seat at all times. Waymo told Forbes it was lobbying to change this regulation.",

      "text": "November 3, 2021\nIntroducing the Waymo Driver to New York City\u2019s streets\nThe Waymo Driver has tested in dozens of cities spanning a diverse range of climates and topographies. Starting tomorrow, we\u2019ll build on these learnings as we begin to map in New York City for the first time.\nNew York City is the most densely populated city in the country, with bustling avenues, unusual road geometries, complex intersections, and constantly evolving layouts, and we\u2019ve designed the Waymo Driver to handle these types of complex and dynamic activities that define city driving. Our vehicles will be manually operated by autonomous specialists at all times, to help us scale and advance our technology in support of our mission to make roads safer.\nThe weather also gives us unique opportunities to learn. The heavy rain and dense snowfall that we expect to encounter will build on the driving we\u2019ve completed to date in the snow and rain, giving us more opportunities to assess the way our sensors perform in wet, cold conditions beyond our data augmentation and simulation testing. Experiencing icy, snowy conditions will allow continued improvement of the Waymo Driver in the real world, and we will apply those learnings across our entire fleet.\nNew Yorkers will begin to see Waymo vehicles driving in Manhattan this week, primarily south of Central Park. Our operations will extend down through the city to the Financial District and also out to a small section of New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel.\nWe\u2019ll be manually driving with five hybrid Chrysler Pacificas on the street during daylight. Later, we\u2019ll manually drive several of our zero-emission Jaguar I-PACEs equipped with our latest technology on the same streets in Manhattan, as we continue learning from NYC\u2019s busy traffic and unique geometric features. The insights we\u2019ll gain will help the Waymo Driver improve its ability to perceive and predict the actions of other road users in dense urban areas.\nOver the last several weeks, we\u2019ve connected with many New York policymakers, regulators, industry leaders, and nonprofit groups to get their feedback, and we\u2019re encouraged by the responses. For example:\nMayor-elect Eric Adams said: \u201cAutonomous vehicles hold the promise to dramatically improve traffic flow and expand access to convenient and affordable transportation for millions of New Yorkers. I\u2019m excited to welcome Waymo to New York so that one day we can have safe autonomous technology on our streets.\u201d\nTech:NYC Executive Director Julie Samuels said: \u201cThe more information we gather about the way our city moves, the closer we get to creating a more efficient, sustainable, and safe mobility network. Tech:NYC is excited to welcome Waymo to New York to help us learn how our streets \u2014 from bike and bus lanes to highways and walkways \u2014 really work.\u201d\nJose Hernandez, Advocacy Coordinator and President of United Spinal Association's New York City Chapter said: \u201cWe appreciate Waymo\u2018s commitment to strengthening access to autonomous vehicles for the masses, including individuals with disabilities. These are the first steps in bringing New York City into the future of transportation that we can all utilize.\u201d\nWe are grateful for their support in our shared belief in improving mobility for more people and making it safer and easier to get people and things where they are going."

We're excited to announce that Waymo One will be expanding to Miami!\nWhile Miami is known for its sun and fun, the city is also an emerging hub for innovation. Waymo\u2019s autonomous driving technology offers an opportunity to provide safer, more accessible, all-electric mobility to Miami\u2019s residents and tourists. In early 2025, we\u2019ll begin reacquainting Waymo\u2019s all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs to Miami's streets. Through our new fleet partnership with Moove, a global leader in innovative mobility solutions, we\u2019ll work to open our doors to riders in 2026, offering our ride-hailing service via the Waymo One app.\nOur previous road trips to the Sunshine State\u2019s challenging rainy conditions have been invaluable in advancing our autonomous driving capabilities and we\u2019re honored to return and bring our service \u2013 which already provides over 150,000 trips per week across Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin \u2013 to the people of Miami.\nWe'll first collaborate with our fleet partner Moove in Phoenix, where they'll begin taking on the management of our fleet operations, facilities, and charging infrastructure. This strategic partnership is designed to maintain and enhance the clean, consistent experience that our riders have come to expect and rely on. In both Phoenix and eventually Miami, Waymo will continue to offer our service through the Waymo One app, and remain responsible for validation and operation of the Waymo Driver.\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Moove in Phoenix and later Miami, bringing together their mobility-focused fleet management experience with our growing Waymo One service,\u201d said Ryan McNamara, Vice President of Operations at Waymo. \u201cTogether, we will provide safe, seamless trips for riders, and scale faster and more cost-effectively over time, with safety continuing to lead the way.\"\n\"Ride hailing has transformed urban mobility over the past 15 years, yet the core experience has largely remained unchanged,\u201d said Ladi Delano, Co-founder and Co-CEO at Moove. \u201cWaymo\u2019s safe, reliable, and convenient Waymo One service leads in autonomous technology, and together, we\u2019re driving a major shift in urban mobility. Moove is proud to partner with Waymo, bringing the operational expertise to make this transformation possible.\"\n\u201cFully autonomous driving technology offers a safe and convenient option to the people of Miami. I\u2019m so pleased to welcome Waymo to our city,\u201d said Francis X. Suarez, Mayor of Miami. \u201cWaymo\u2019s commitment to sustainability with their all-electric fleet is the perfect mobility option to our city as we continue to prioritize low cost, clean energy.\u201d\n\u00a1Hasta pronto, Miami!"

      "text": "Taxi driving in U.S. cities like New York and Chicago has been a regulated industry since at least the 1930s. A limited number of medallions, representing a licensing fee paid to the city, were issued to taxicab owners. Many taxi drivers worked part time or temporarily, like Uber drivers today. But the system also offered a potential career path for those willing to put up with the long hours (12-hour shifts were common) and uncomfortable conditions (trying to find a bathroom was always a challenge). For those who stuck with cab driving for a number of years and accumulated a nest egg, putting a down payment on a medallion and becoming your own boss was also possible.\nBut the medallion system, which limited the number of livery vehicles, has been bypassed by the ride-share giants. Last year, more people used Uber than yellow cabs in New York City, according to the Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). Nationally, receipts from Certify software show that in Q1 2014, ride-hailing was a mere 8% of the business traveler ground transportation market, while rental cars were 55% and taxis were 37%. By Q1 2018, ride-hailing had grabbed 70.5% of the market, with rental cars getting 23.5% and taxis just 6%.\nNew York taxi medallions, worth a million dollars as recently as 2014, are now worth $170,000. From newly arrived immigrants to Trump lawyer and taxicab owner Michael Cohen, those in the taxi industry feel the pinch. Taxi driver representatives relate a doleful tale of bankruptcies, foreclosures, evictions and heart attacks, in a profession that was once a stepping stone to the middle class. At least five taxi and livery drivers in New York City alone are believed to have committed suicide over the past six months.\nIn May, the body of taxi driver Yu Mein Chow, 56, was found in New York\u2019s East River. He had taken out a loan in 2011 to buy a $700,000 taxi medallion. But recently he was apparently despondent about his inability to pay the loan and his wife\u2019s medical bills and support his daughter in college. His death followed the shocking suicide of livery driver Doug Schifter, who killed himself in front of New York City Hall. In his last words, Schifter, a 40-year driver, blamed New York government and TLC actions (or inactions) for creating \"a huge number of cars available\" and driving down revenues for professionals like himself.\nThe taxicab industry believes the playing field has so far not been level. With their limited capital investment in vehicles (drivers generally bring their own) and employees (the overwhelming majority of ride-share drivers are independent contractors without benefits), and so far limited regulation, the ride-share companies have severely damaged the traditional yellow cab industry.\nTo be fair, the now-threatened taxi industry was no paradise. Like ride-share drivers today, cab drivers would occasionally be accused of robbing or raping inebriated passengers. Taxi drivers in my garage were not above taking French tourists on complex circumnavigations of Queens before depositing them at their Manhattan hotel, $400 poorer. Corruption reigned, from drivers routinely underreporting cash tips to the so-called \u201cTaxi King,\u201d a partner of Trump attorney Michael Cohen, failing to pay $5 million in tax surcharges.\nAnd a benefit of Uber and Lyft, beyond the low prices that have undercut the taxi industry, appears to be service to underserved communities. New York City cabs were notorious for not picking up African-Americans. So the motto of some \"gypsy\" cabs, which did serve urban communities, was \u201cWe\u2019re not yellow; we go anywhere.\u201d\nCould taxi drivers walk away from their medallion cabs and drive for the ride-share giants? Certainly \u2014 but most likely their income would take a major haircut.\nDriving for Uber or Lyft is seen as part of the \u201cgig economy,\u201d no matter how many bonuses and rate increases the still-private giants dangle at drivers. For many, driving provides a $10-$15 hour part-time job. For others, Uber expenses, vehicle expenses and vehicle depreciation have turned $12,000 in earnings into a $4,000 loss.\nStill, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and his media team paint the picture of a kinder, gentler Uber in advance of a planned 2019 IPO. A spokesperson responded to questions about the company\u2019s practices in New York by saying, \"Uber has worked hard to grow the transportation pie, ensuring that all New Yorkers can get a ride in minutes, particularly in neighborhoods outside of Manhattan that have been long ignored by yellow taxis and underserved by public transit.\"\nCab drivers know that their protests against \u201cuberization\u201d are seen as the equivalent of putting one\u2019s finger in the dike to hold back the tide of progress. And in the long run, the dislocation and disruption caused by Uber and Lyft may well create a new set of winners, including consumers and stockholders. But for people who have spent their lives as cab drivers, that transition may be a difficult one."

      "text": "October 8, 2020\nWaymo is opening its fully driverless service to the general public in Phoenix\nEditor\u2019s note: In the time since publication, we\u2019ve worked through our long waitlist, have continued to increase our supply, and now anyone in the U.S. can download the app directly (available on Google Play and the App Store) and instantly hail a fully autonomous ride in our service territory. Happy riding!\nFive years ago this month, Steve Mahan, the retired director of the Santa Clara Valley Blind Center, who lost his sight years before, took the world's first ride in a self-driving car on public roads. This little car, called Firefly, had a top speed of just 25 mph, and used a combination of lidar, radar, cameras, and massive on-board computing power to navigate the busy streets of Austin, Texas.\nSince that first ride, which some have called a Kitty Hawk moment of sorts for fully autonomous technology, Waymo has been hard at work to bring the Waymo Driver to more and more people. In 2017, we began our early rider program in the Metro Phoenix area with the next generation of our technology, using the full-size hybrid Chrysler Pacifica. This 4th-generation Waymo Driver was significantly more sophisticated than Firefly\u2019s technology, and for the last year, has pioneered fully driverless, paid rides on high-speed roads across a service area larger than the city of San Francisco.\nOver time, as we improved the capability of our Waymo Driver, we increased the scope and quantity of our operations, with 5-10% of our rides in 2020 being fully driverless for our exclusive group of early riders under NDA. We\u2019ve been gathering key learnings from these riders on how to optimize our driverless service experience and continuously improve it (in their words, it's a magical experience). We also began to offer more people access to our public Waymo One service, with a vehicle operator monitoring the ride.\nBeginning today, October 8, we\u2019re excited to open up our fully driverless offering to Waymo One riders. Members of the public service can now take friends and family along on their rides and share their experience with the world. We\u2019ll start with those who are already a part of Waymo One and, over the next several weeks, welcome more people directly into the service through our app (available on Google Play and the App Store). In the near term, 100% of our rides will be fully driverless. We expect our new fully driverless service to be very popular, and we\u2019re thankful to our riders for their patience as we ramp up availability to serve demand. Later this year, after we've finished adding in-vehicle barriers between the front row and the rear passenger cabin for in-vehicle hygiene and safety, we'll also be re-introducing rides with a trained vehicle operator, which will add capacity and allow us to serve a larger geographical area.\nWe\u2019ve achieved this milestone with the thought and care that our riders expect from us. We\u2019ve enhanced our health and safety policies and procedures throughout our fully-owned fleet, sought the feedback of our team, partners, riders, as well as federal, local, and state authorities, all while continuing to advance the Waymo Driver\u2019s capabilities.\nTo our entire community: thank you for being a part of this important journey. And to all the Waymonauts who\u2019ve worked so hard getting us here: thanks for your dedication to our mission. Together, we\u2019re building a safe and more accessible future with every autonomous mile we drive.\nCheck out more on how we\u2019re safely resuming our rider services at waymo.com/coronavirus."

      "text": "Waymo, the leading U.S. robotaxi operator, plans to launch the autonomous ride service in Dallas next year, its second market in Texas, where it\u2019s partnering with Avis to keep its growing fleet of electric vehicles in service. The Alphabet Inc. unit\u2019s steady expansion pace draws a sharp contrast with Tesla, which remains in test mode despite CEO Elon Musk\u2019s continued claims of its autonomous tech prowess.\nMountain View, California-based Waymo said in a blog post it\u2019s launching commercial rides in Dallas in 2026, where it\u2019s also been testing, without specifying exactly when. It already operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and Atlanta, and previously said it would launch service in Miami and Washington, DC, next year as well. The company said Dallas is of interest as it thinks it can help road safety in a city with the highest traffic fatality rate among U.S. cities with populations above 1 million people.\nFor the latest in cleantech and sustainability news, sign up here for our Current Climate newsletter.\nThe news comes a week after Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo could soon triple the number of cities it\u2019s operating in. \u201cThe Waymo driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads, and the team is testing across more than ten cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia,\u201d he said on Alphabet\u2019s July 23 results calls. \u201cWe hope to serve riders in all ten in the future.\u201d\nAlong with Dallas, New York and Philadelphia, Waymo has confirmed that it\u2019s testing electric robotaxis in Houston, San Antonio, Miami, San Diego, Nashville, Washington, Boston and Tokyo. Currently, it\u2019s providing over 250,000 paid rides a week in the five cities where the service is available. That could be worth at least $5.1 million a week, based on an average fare of $20.43 per ride, an estimate by Obi, an app that aggregates real-time ride-hail prices.\nBy comparison, Tesla is operating \u201csupervised\u201d robotaxi rides in a small portion of Austin, with a technician sitting in the front passenger seat to assist in the event of problems. So far, those have included problematic left turns, hitting a parked car and at least one incident of a vehicle failing to stop at a train crossing on its own as a train approached. Tesla is also testing its tech in San Francisco, but with onboard human safety techs as the company doesn\u2019t have permits to operate a robotaxi service in California (Coincidentally, it\u2019s also awaiting a ruling by the state\u2019s Office of Administrative Hearings over charges brought by the DMV of false advertising that its overstated the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software.)\nDespite Tesla\u2019s minimal commercial progress with its robotaxis, Musk once again claimed last week that his company is leading in the technology, despite its decision to use only cameras for its vision system, rather than laser lidar and radar, which Waymo and most other competitors and autonomous tech experts believe is essential to ensure safety.\n\u201cTesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI,\u201d Musk said on its results call last week. \u201cA clear proof point for that would be if you compare it to Waymo. Waymo's car is best with god knows how many sensors. Isn't Google good at AI? Yes. But they are not good at real-world AI. Tesla is much better than Google. By far.\u201d\nAvis will work with Waymo in Dallas to keep its robotaxis there charged up and cleaned at fleet depots, and provide basic maintenance."

  "argos_summary": "Waymo has begun testing its autonomous vehicles in Manhattan with human drivers, while lobbying to lift New York\u2019s requirement that a person sit in the driver\u2019s seat. The company plans to launch a fully autonomous ride\u2011hailing service in the city once permits are granted, and is expanding its fleet to other markets such as Miami, Dallas, and Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, New York\u2019s taxi medallion system has collapsed under the pressure of ride\u2011share competition, leading to financial hardship and even suicides among drivers. Waymo\u2019s tests in NYC are part of a broader push to demonstrate safety and gather data in dense urban environments, with the company already operating paid robotaxis in several U.S. cities and aiming to serve millions of riders nationwide.",
