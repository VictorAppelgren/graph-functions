  "content": "This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here.\n\nAnd worse yet, as TomDispatch regular Joshua Frank reports today, whatever the casualty figures from that ongoing slaughter may prove to be when the fighting finally stops (assuming it does someday), it will be anything but the final count. At least it won\u2019t be if you include all of the human beings devastated by the conflict. Sadly, in some fashion, we really do need to add to that count a potential epidemic of casualties from cancer that are likely to be caused by that nightmarish war. Let Frank explain. Tom\n\nEven for wars , such figures are staggering \u2014 and, of course, they\u2019re only part of the almost unimaginable toll of dead and wounded in that remarkably small 25-mile strip of land that\u2019s been the focus of Israeli devastation since the nightmarish Hamas attack on Israel occurred almost two years ago.\n\nHonestly, can you believe it? Only a couple of weeks after Israeli forces targeted and killed four Al Jazeera journalists in a tent outside al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, it happened again. This time, at least five journalists, including one who \u201chad reported for The Associated Press on children being treated for starvation at the same facility,\u201d died in a second Israeli air strike on Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, after rescuers (and journalists covering them) rushed to deal with the initial strike on the top floor of one of that hospital\u2019s buildings. All told, in fact, it seems that nearly 200 journalists and media workers of various sorts have been killed (or should the word be slaughtered?) since the war in Gaza began.\n\nA week after the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023, a large explosion incinerated a parking lot near the busy Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, killing more than 470 people. It was a horrifying, chaotic scene. Burnt clothing was strewn about, scorched vehicles piled atop one another, and charred buildings surrounded the impact zone. Israel claimed the blast was caused by an errant rocket fired by Palestinian extremists, but an investigation by Forensic Architecture later indicated that the missile was most likely launched from Israel, not from inside Gaza.\n\nIn those first days of the onslaught, it wasn\u2019t yet clear that wiping out Gaza\u2019s entire healthcare system could conceivably be part of the Israeli plan. After all, it\u2019s well known that purposely bombing or otherwise destroying hospitals violates the Geneva Conventions and is a war crime, so there was still some hope that the explosion at Al-Ahli was accidental. And that, of course, would be the narrative that Israeli authorities would continue to push over the nearly two years of death and misery that followed.\n\nA month into Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive, however, soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would raid the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, dismantling its dialysis center with no explanation as to why such life-saving medical equipment would be targeted. (Not even Israel was contending that Hamas was having kidney problems.) Then, in December 2023, Al-Awda Hospital, also in northern Gaza, was hit, while at least one doctor was shot by Israeli snipers stationed outside it. As unnerving as such news stories were, the most gruesome footage released at the time came from Al-Nasr children\u2019s hospital, where infants were found dead and decomposing in an empty ICU ward. Evacuation orders had been given and the medical staff had fled, unable to take the babies with them.\n\nFor those monitoring such events, a deadly pattern was beginning to emerge, and Israel\u2019s excuses for its malevolent behavior were already losing credibility.\n\nShortly after Israel issued warnings to evacuate the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City in mid-January 2024, its troops launched rockets at the building, destroying what remained of its functioning medical equipment. Following that attack, ever more clinics were also targeted by Israeli forces. A Jordan Field Hospital was shelled that January and again this past August. An air strike hit Yafa hospital early in December 2023. The Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis in southern Gaza was also damaged last May and again this August, when the hospital and an ambulance were struck, killing 20, including five journalists.\n\nWhile human-rights groups like the International Criminal Court, the United Nations, and the Red Cross have condemned Israel for such attacks, its forces have continued to decimate medical facilities and aid sites. At the same time, Israeli authorities claimed that they were only targeting Hamas command centers and weapons storage facilities.\n\nThe Death of Gaza\u2019s Only Cancer Center\n\nIn early 2024, the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, first hit in October 2023 and shuttered in November of that year, was in the early stages of being demolished by IDF battalions. A video released in February by Middle East Eye showed footage of an elated Israeli soldier sharing a TikTok video of himself driving a bulldozer into that hospital, chuckling as his digger crushed a cinderblock wall. \u201cThe hospital accidentally broke,\u201d he said. Evidence of Israel\u2019s crimes was by then accumulating, much of it provided by the IDF itself.\n\nWhen that Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital opened in 2018, it quickly became Gaza\u2019s leading and most well-equipped cancer treatment facility. As the Covid-19 pandemic reached Gaza in 2020, all oncology operations were transferred to that hospital to free up space at other clinics, making it the only cancer center to serve Gaza\u2019s population of more than two million.\n\n\u201cThis hospital will help transform the health sector,\u201d Palestinian Health Minister Jawad Awwad said shortly before its opening. \u201c[It] will help people who are going through extreme difficulties.\u201d\n\nLittle did he know that those already facing severe difficulties due to their cancer diagnoses would all too soon face full-blown catastrophe. In March 2025, what remained of the hospital would be razed, erasing all traces of Gaza\u2019s once-promising cancer treatment.\n\nBefore October 7, 2023, the most common cancers afflicting Palestinians in Gaza were breast and colon cancer. Survival rates were, however, much lower there than in Israel, thanks to more limited medical resources and restrictions imposed by that country. From 2016 to 2019, while cases in Gaza were on the rise, there was at least hope that the hospital, funded by Turkey, would offer much-needed cancer screenings that had previously been unavailable.\n\n\u201cThe repercussions of the current conflict on cancer care in Gaza will likely be felt for years to come,\u201d according to a November 2023 editorial in the medical journal Cureus. \u201cThe immediate challenges of drugs, damaged infrastructure, and reduced access to specialized treatment have long-term consequences on the overall health outcomes of current patients.\u201d\n\nIn other words, lack of medical care and worse cancer rates will not only continue to disproportionately affect Gazans compared to Israelis, but conditions will undoubtedly deteriorate significantly more. And such predictions don\u2019t even take into account the fact that war itself causes cancer, painting an even bleaker picture of the medical future for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nWhen the Second Battle of Fallujah, part of America\u2019s nightmarish war in Iraq, ended in December 2004, the embattled city was a toxic warzone, contaminated with munitions, depleted uranium (DU), and poisoned dust from collapsed buildings. Not surprisingly, in the years that followed, cancer rates increased almost exponentially there. Initially, doctors began to notice that more cancers were being diagnosed. Scientific research would soon back up their observations, revealing a startling trend.\n\nIn the decade after the fighting had mostly ended, leukemia rates among the local population skyrocketed by a dizzying 2,200%. It was the most significant increase ever recorded after a war, exceeding even Hiroshima\u2019s 660% rise over a more extended period of time. One study later tallied a fourfold increase in all cancers and, for childhood cancers, a twelvefold increase.\n\nThe most likely source of many of those cancers was the mixture of DU, building materials, and other leftover munitions. Researchers soon observed that residing inside or near contaminated sites in Fallujah was likely the catalyst for the boom in cancer rates.\n\n\u201cOur research in Fallujah indicated that the majority of families returned to their bombarded homes and lived there, or otherwise rebuilt on top of the contaminated rubble of their old homes,\u201d explained Dr. Mozghan Savabieasfahani, an environmental toxicologist who studied the health impacts of war in Fallujah. \u201cWhen possible, they also used building materials that were salvaged from the bombarded sites. Such common practices will contribute to the public\u2019s continuous exposure to toxic metals years after the bombardment of their area has ended.\u201d\n\nWhile difficult to quantify, we do have some idea of the amount of munitions and DU that continues to plague that city. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United States fired between 170 and 1,700 tons of tank-busting munitions in Iraq, including Fallujah, which might have amounted to as many as 300,000 rounds of DU. While only mildly radioactive, persistent exposure to depleted uranium has a cumulative effect on the human body. The more you\u2019re exposed, the more the radioactive particles build up in your bones, which, in turn, can cause cancers like leukemia.\n\nWith its population of 300,000, Fallujah served as a military testing ground for munitions much like those that Gaza endures today. In the short span of one month, from March 19 to April 18, 2003, more than 29,199 bombs were dropped on Iraq, 19,040 of which were precision-guided, along with another 1,276 cluster bombs. The impacts were grave. More than 60 of Fallujah\u2019s 200 mosques were destroyed, and of the city\u2019s 50,000 buildings, more than 10,000 were imploded and 39,000 damaged. Amid such destruction, there was a whole lot of toxic waste. As a March 2025 report from Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project noted, \u201cWe found that the environmental impact of warfighting and the presence of heavy metals are long-lasting and widespread in both human bodies and soil.\u201d\n\nExposure to heavy metals is distinctly associated with cancer risk. \u201cProlonged exposure to specific heavy metals has been correlated with the onset of various cancers, including those affecting the skin, lungs, and kidneys,\u201d a 2023 report in Scientific Studies explains. \u201cThe gradual buildup of these metals within the body can lead to persistent toxic effects. Even minimal exposure levels can result in their gradual accumulation in tissues, disrupting normal cellular operations and heightening the likelihood of diseases, particularly cancer.\u201d\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just cancer that afflicted the population that stuck around or returned to Fallujah. Infants began to be born with alarming birth defects. A 2010 study found a significant increase in heart ailments among babies there, with rates 13 times higher and nervous system defects 33 times higher than in European births.\n\n\u201cWe have all kinds of defects now, ranging from congenital heart disease to severe physical abnormalities, both in numbers you cannot imagine,\u201d Dr Samira Alani, a pediatric specialist at Fallujah General Hospital, who co-authored the birth-defect study, told Al Jazeera in 2013. \u201cWe have so many cases of babies with multiple system defects\u2026 Multiple abnormalities in one baby. For example, we just had one baby with central nervous system problems, skeletal defects, and heart abnormalities. This is common in Fallujah today.\u201d\n\nWhile comprehensive health assessments in Iraq are scant, evidence continues to suggest that high cancer rates persist in places like Fallujah. \u201cFallujah today, among other bombarded cities in Iraq, reports a high rate of cancers,\u201d researchers from the Costs of War Project study report. \u201cThese high rates of cancer and birth defects may be attributed to exposure to the remnants of war, as are manifold other similar spikes in, for example, early onset cancers and respiratory diseases.\u201d\n\nAs devastating as the war in Iraq was \u2014 and as contaminated as Fallujah remains \u2014 it\u2019s nearly impossible to envision what the future holds for those left in Gaza, where the situation is so much worse. If Fallujah teaches us anything, it\u2019s that Israel\u2019s destruction will cause cancer rates to rise significantly, impacting generations to come.\n\nThe aerial photographs and satellite footage are grisly. Israel\u2019s U.S.-backed military machine has dropped so many bombs that entire neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble. Gaza, by every measure, is a land of immense suffering. As Palestinian children hang on the brink of starvation, it feels strange to discuss the health effects they might face in the decades ahead, should they be fortunate enough to survive.\n\nWhile data often conceals the truth, in Gaza, numbers reveal a dire reality. As of this year, nearly 70% of all roads had been destroyed, 90% of all homes damaged or completely gone, 85% of farmland affected, and 84% of healthcare facilities obliterated. To date, Israel\u2019s relentless death machine has created at least 50 million tons of rubble, human remains, and hazardous materials \u2014 all the noxious ingredients necessary for a future cancer epidemic.\n\nFrom October 2023 to April 2024, well over 70,000 tons of explosives were dropped on Gaza, which, according to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, was equivalent to two nuclear bombs. While the extent and exact types of weaponry used there are not fully known, the European Parliament has accused Israel of deploying depleted uranium, which, if true, will only add to the future cancer ills of Gazans. Most bombs contain heavy metals like lead, antimony, bismuth, cobalt, and tungsten, which end up polluting the soil and groundwater, while impacting agriculture and access to clean water for years to come.\n\n\u201cThe toxicological effects of metals and energetic materials on microorganisms, plants, and animals vary widely and can be significantly different depending on whether the exposure is acute (short term) or chronic (long term),\u201d reads a 2021 report commissioned by the Guide to Explosive Ordnance Pollution of the Environment. \u201cIn some cases, the toxic effects may not be immediately apparent, but instead may be linked to an increased risk of cancer, or increased risk of mutation during pregnancy, which may not become evident for many years.\u201d\n\nGiven such information, we can only begin to predict how toxic the destruction may prove to be. The homes that once stood in the Gaza Strip were mainly made of concrete and steel. Particles of dust released from such crumbled buildings can themselves cause lung, colon, and stomach cancers.\n\nAs current cancer patients die slow deaths with no access to the care they need, future patients, who will acquire cancer thanks to Israel\u2019s genocidal mania, will no doubt meet the same fate unless there is significant intervention.\n\n\u201c[A]pproximately 2,700 [Gazans] in advanced stages of the disease await treatment with no hope or treatment options within the Gaza Strip under an ongoing closure of Gaza\u2019s crossings, and the disruption of emergency medical evacuation mechanisms,\u201d states a May 2025 report by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. \u201c[We hold] Israel fully responsible for the deaths of hundreds of cancer patients and for deliberately obliterating any opportunities of treatment for thousands more by destroying their treatment centers and depriving them of travel. Such acts fall under the crime of genocide ongoing in the Gaza Strip.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s methodical destruction in Gaza has taken on many forms, from bombing civilian enclaves and hospitals to withholding food, water, and medical care from those most in need. In due time, Israel will undoubtedly use the cancers it will have created as a means to an end, fully aware that Palestinians there have no way of preparing for the health crises that are coming.\n\nCancer, in short, will be but another weapon added to Israel\u2019s ever-increasing arsenal.",

After the war, we tried to retrieve him, but with the building so large and with no heavy machinery available, it was impossible.\n\u201cWe searched everywhere for a bulldozer to reach the ground floor \u2013 where Omar had been \u2013 but during the war, Israeli forces destroyed or burned all the bulldozers or excavators that could have helped us.\u201d\nA decent burial\nIn southern Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis, the Dajani family continues to live in what\u2019s left of their destroyed home, where the bodies of three of their children remain buried.\nTheir father Ali remembers the time they died with a heavy heart.\n\u201cWe fled to the beach area during the bombings. When we returned, the house was gone \u2013 and our children were still under the debris. We are forced to live here, but this is not life. It is unbearable,\u201d he told our correspondent.\n\u201cWe have no clean water, no food. We are lost. All we ask is to recover our children\u2019s bodies. To bury the dead is sacred. That is all we want.\u201d\nJust days ago, Mr. Dajani spoke as diggers worked nearby to clear away the debris. That effort, too, has come to a halt for now.\nA mounting humanitarian crisis\nThe UN estimates that approximately 92 per cent of all residential buildings in Gaza \u2013 around 436,000 homes \u2013 have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict.\nThe resulting debris amounts to nearly 50 million tonnes \u2013 an overwhelming quantity of rubble that would take decades to remove under current conditions.\nHumanitarian organizations warn that the delay in debris removal and body recovery is not only deepening psychological trauma across Gaza but also threatens to become a public health and environmental catastrophe."

      "text": "Israel has turned 70% of Gaza into no-go zones, in maps\nSince Israel broke the ceasefire, it has declared most of Gaza as no-go zones, forcing expulsions amid attacks and blocking of all humanitarian aid.\nIsrael has restricted Palestinians\u2019 access to 70 percent of Gaza, either by declaring large areas as no-go zones or issuing forced displacement orders, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\nIn southern Gaza, much of Rafah governorate has been declared a no-go zone, placed under forced displacement orders by the Israeli military since late March. In the north, nearly all of Gaza City is under similar orders, with only small pockets in the northwest still exempt. Entire areas east of the Shujayea neighbourhood and along the Israeli border have been declared a restricted zone.\nThe animated map below shows how Israel\u2019s military has expanded its forced displacement orders since breaking the ceasefire on March 18.\nIsrael\u2019s Gaza occupation plan\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Gaza\u2019s more than two million people \u201cwill be moved\u201d in a new ground offensive that will involve Israeli troops holding on to seized territory, establishing a \u201csustained presence\u201d in Gaza.\nThis follows the unanimous approval by Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet to call up 60,000 reservists and place the Israeli military in control of delivering food and other essential supplies to Gaza\u2019s starving population.\nIsrael prioritising territorial control\nReporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum said Palestinians view the Israeli ground offensive in Gaza and reoccupation of much of its territorial landscape as a form of collective punishment and an attempt to change the demographic and political map of Gaza.\nMany Palestinians understand that Israel is prioritising territorial control over any political solution, and many shared their fear and panic regarding the possibility of not being able to return to their homes.\nThey also believe that Israel is trying not just to dismantle the military capabilities of Hamas, as the Israeli military spokesperson and Netanyahu have stated, but they are also trying to empty Gaza of its residents and to suffocate civilians.\nIsrael will do this by using humanitarian language alongside military tactics, including an expanded ground offensive and tightening its grip on the flow of aid to Gaza.\nBut there was a general and clear sentiment of defiance among many Palestinians. Social media is filled with messages of resilience and people saying they will not leave Gaza, whatever the cost.\nGaza facing \u2018extreme risk of famine\u2019\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says Gaza is facing \u201cextreme risk of famine\u201d with no food remaining in markets and aid distribution centres.\nIsraeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem has accused Israel of \u201cusing starvation as a method of warfare\u201d in Gaza. Half of those being starved by Israel are children, the prominent rights group said.\n\u201c[On] the nutritional front, the population is facing once again an extreme risk of famine,\u201d the PRCS said in its latest situation update.\n\u201cThere is an inability to meet even the minimum daily needs of over a million displaced people,\u201d it said.\nThe PRCS\u2019s food stocks allocated for displaced people are now \u201ccompletely depleted\u201d, with \u201climited quantities of legumes\u201d being \u201cdistributed to community kitchens to cover some of the basic needs of displaced individuals\u201d.\nSince Israel broke the nearly two-month-long ceasefire with Hamas on March 18, its military has killed at least 2,459 Palestinians in Gaza, bringing the total number of confirmed killed in the besieged Strip to 52,567."

In Falluja, leukemia rates increased by 2,200% in a much shorter space of time, averaged just five to 10 years after the bombings. Anecdotally, doctors in Iraq began reporting a big increase in cancer rates as well as congenital anomalies (commonly referred to as \u201cbirth defects\u201d) after the US began bombing the country. The research, led by Dr Christopher Busby while he was at the University of Ulster, showed that the doctors\u2019 observations were backed up by data.\nIn addition to the huge increase in leukemia, Busby and his colleagues found a 1,260% increase in rates of childhood cancer in Falluja after the US bombing as well as a 740% increase in brain tumors. They also found evidence that Iraqis had been exposed to radiation, as infant mortality rates were 820% higher than in neighboring Kuwait.\nThe atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States in 1945 was one of the worst atrocities in human history. When Dr Busby compared the numbers to those in Falluja, he found that \u201cthe cancer levels are astonishing\u201d, adding: \u201cThe peak effect in those at Hiroshima who were most irradiated was less than the effect in all of Falluja.\u201d"

      "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: The following story includes graphic material. Audience discretion is advised.\nThe scene inside the Al-Nasr hospital ICU ward is chilling. The tiny bodies of babies, several still attached to wires and tubes that were meant to keep them alive, decomposing in their hospital beds. Milk bottles and spare diapers still next to them on the sheets.\nThe video inside the hospital was filmed on November 27 by Mohamed Baalousha, a Gaza reporter for UAE-based news outlet Al Mashhad. He shared an unblurred version with CNN, which shows the remains of at least four infants.\nThree of them appear to be still connected to hospital machines. The bodies of the babies appear to be darkening and disintegrating from decay, with little more than skeletons left in some of the beds. Flies and maggots are visibly crawling across the skin of one child.\nThe circumstances around one of the most horrifying videos to emerge from the war in Gaza remain unclear, but after days of piecing together available information, using interviews, published statements and video, a chaotic scene can been painted of hospital staff trying to protect their most vulnerable patients, caught in the middle of a raging battle \u2013 waiting for help that never arrived.\nHere is what CNN found\nCNN geolocated the video to Al-Nasr hospital in northern Gaza. This area has been largely unreachable to journalists in recent weeks due to the intensity of fighting but during the seven-day truce Baalousha says he was able to access the hospital to film what was left there.\nFrom early November, the Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi children\u2019s hospitals, which form part of the same complex, had become the frontline of fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces.\nIn public statements and interviews, several medical staff and health officials from Al-Nasr said they had to hurriedly evacuate the hospital on November 10, under the direction of Israeli forces.\nMedical staff described having to leave young children behind in the ICU because they had no means to safely move them.\nA doctor associated with the hospital, who did not want to be named, told CNN that two of the children \u2013 a two-year-old and a nine-month-old baby \u2013 had died shortly before the evacuation but that three children were left alive still connected to respirators. One of those left alive was two months old. Several of the infants on the ICU had been suffering from genetic disorders, according to the doctor.\nThe condition of those left behind alive \u2013 both at the time the fighting reached the hospital and when the evacuation took place \u2013 remains unclear.\nIn a video on November 9, the head of Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi pediatric hospitals, Dr. Mustafa al-Kahlout, said Al-Nasr hospital had been \u201cstruck twice\u201d sustaining \u201ca lot of damage.\u201d\nKahlout warned oxygen to the ICU \u201cwas cut off\u201d and reported at least one patient had died as a result, with others facing the risk of death.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether oxygen cylinders, seen next to some of the beds in the video from the hospital, were functioning or whether supplies had run out.\n\u201cThe situation is really bad, we are surrounded\u2026 ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and ambulances that tried to reach Al-Nasr were targeted,\u201d Kahlout said, calling on international organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to intervene and save the medical staff and patients who remained in the ICU.\nVideo shared on social media on November 9, which CNN verified, was filmed from inside Al-Nasr hospital and appears to show the aftermath of the building being hit.\nAnother from November 10 showed an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tank outside Al-Nasr, indicating the IDF was operating in the area. Another video from the same date showed civilians holding up makeshift white flags attempting to flee the hospital amid gunfire, then being forced to run back inside. It is not possible to tell from the video who is shooting.\nSatellite imagery reviewed by CNN from November 11 shows large craters around the hospital complex, indicating the area had been under bombardment, making evacuation difficult.\nBut, in an audio recording of a conversation between a senior official at Al-Rantisi hospital and an officer from COGAT, which coordinates the Israeli government\u2019s activities in the Palestinian territories and Gaza, it appears Israeli forces instructed hospital patients and staff to evacuate.\nIn the recording, released by the IDF on November 11, the Israeli officer assures the hospital official that ambulances will be arranged.\nThe hospital official tells the COGAT officer that ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and the officer replies: \u201cI\u2019ll arrange coordination with the primary aid center. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m near the army, it will be okay.\u201d\n\u201cWill the ambulances take the patients and the medical staff?\u201d the hospital official asks.\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d the COGAT officer responds, in the recording.\nThe hospital official then confirms that the COGAT officer is aware that people will be evacuating both Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi hospitals, and the COGAT officer says \u201cyes, yes.\u201d\nBut hospital officials say the ambulances never arrived.\n\u201cMany of the patients were carried out by their families, ambulances couldn\u2019t reach the hospital,\u201d Kahlout said in a news conference on November 14, following the evacuation.\nThree children were left in the ICU attached to hospital machines but without oxygen, Kahlout said.\nIn an audio recording from November 10 released by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) a nurse who the organization said was volunteering in a personal capacity, said the hospital had been shelled, hitting multiple floors, water tanks, and electricity and oxygen stations.\nThe nurse \u2013 who CNN is not identifying for security reasons \u2013 said Al-Nasr staff were given 30 minutes to evacuate by the IDF, adding no ambulances were able to reach the hospital.\n\u201cWe walked out a little bit there was shooting around us,\u201d he said in the recording. Then he said someone from the IDF told him \u201cI\u2019ll give you safe passage, you have from 1130am until 12 noon.\u201d\n\u201cSo, we walked out with our hands up in the air carrying white flags and carrying families and children,\u201d the nurse said in the recording.\nHe said he managed to carry one baby with him as he escaped and handed it to an ambulance headed for the Al-Shifa hospital. But four children were left behind in the ICU according to the nurse, in a discrepancy from the number given by Kahlout.\n\u201cTo leave my patient dying in front of my eyes is the hardest thing I have ever experienced, it\u2019s indescribable, they broke our hearts, we couldn\u2019t help them, we couldn\u2019t take them, we barely left ourselves with our children, we are civilians, we are a medical crew, we are displaced civilians,\u201d he said in the recording.\nOver the past week, CNN has tried to speak to medical staff and hospital officials from Al-Nasr, but all have either said they are too afraid to speak or cannot be reached.\nThe director of Gaza\u2019s hospitals at the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health, Dr. Mohammad Zaqout, told CNN that people in the hospital were forced to leave by the IDF.\n\u201cWe were forced to leave them behind to die because we didn\u2019t have a safe medical evacuation\u2026 we informed them that these children were on beds and couldn\u2019t be evacuated. We held other children in our arms while being forced to evacuate,\u201d Zaqout said.\nThe IDF has strongly denied responsibility for the deaths of the children in Al-Nasr ICU. \u201cGiven that the IDF did not operate inside the Al-Nasr hospital, these allegations are not only false but also a perverse exploitation of innocent lives, used as tools to spread dangerous misinformation,\u201d the IDF said in a statement to CNN.\nAsked repeatedly by CNN why it hadn\u2019t provided ambulances for the evacuation, as the COGAT officer had promised in the recorded conversation with the hospital official, and if they were aware of the presence of children left in the ICU, as Zaqout alleged, the IDF did not directly respond.\nDuring an online Q&A for journalists Saturday, IDF spokesman Doron Spielman dismissed the story as merely a \u201crumor.\u201d\n\u201cThere were no premature babies that decomposed because of the IDF. There were probably no babies that decomposed whatsoever,\u201d Spielman said. \u201cBut Hamas is in charge of Nasr hospital, we are not occupying Nasr hospital.\u201d\nIsrael has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as command centers and even as places to hold hostages.\nZaqout denies the allegation and has repeatedly called for \u201cneutral entities, human rights organizations, and media outlets to enter the hospitals and verify for themselves that they are used solely for civilian and humanitarian purposes.\u201d\nCNN cannot independently confirm what state the children were in when they were left at the hospital. But Stefan Schmitt, a forensic scientist at Florida International University reviewed the video for CNN and said the level of decomposition of the infants was advanced.\nSchmitt said he believed the room had not been disturbed since the children were left. \u201cThose remains decomposed in situ, meaning they decomposed there on those beds,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see that from the bodily fluids that have leaked out over the time of decomposition.\u201d\nSchmitt also said one of the corpses appeared to be wrapped in fabric, possibly a shroud, noting there was no medical equipment attached to the body, suggesting the body may already have been dead or severely injured. The room appeared to have been abandoned in a hurry, Schmitt continued, noting the infant car seat and what appears to be a bag packed for one of the children next to its bed.\nA statement from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health issued in response to the video of the babies\u2019 remains said Al-Nasr nursing staff were ordered to leave by the IDF, who told them the ICRC was coming to evacuate the patients.\n\u201cInstead, their decomposed bodies were found in their beds,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cThese babies drew their last breaths alone and died alone.\u201d\nThe ICRC told CNN it received \u201cseveral requests\u201d for evacuation from hospitals in the north of Gaza, but due to the \u201csecurity situation\u201d it was \u201cnot involved in any operations or evacuations, nor did teams commit to doing so.\u201d The ICRC added the footage of the deceased children was an \u201cunspeakable tragedy.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Gianluca Mezzofiore, Nic Robertson, Celine Alkhadi, Katie Polglase, Mostafa Salem and Sahar Akbarzai contributed to this report"

This is the first time that any US DU firing coordinates have been released, despite previous requests by the United Nations Environment Programme and the Iraqi government.\nAccording to PAX's report, which is due to be published this week, the data shows that many of the DU rounds were fired in or near populated areas of Iraq, including As Samawah, Nasiriyah and Basrah. At least 1,500 rounds were also aimed at troops, the group says.\nThis conflicts with legal advice from the US Air Force in 1975 suggesting that DU weapons should only be used against hard targets like tanks and armoured vehicles, the report says. This advice, designed to comply with international law by minimising deaths and injuries to urban populations and troops, was largely ignored by US forces, it argues.\nA six-page memo by Major James Miles and Will Carroll from the international law division of USAF's Office of the Judge Advocate General concluded in March 1975 that DU weapons were legal. But it recommended imposing restrictions on how they were used.\n\"Use of this munition solely against personnel is prohibited if alternative weapons are available,\" the memo stated. This was for legal reasons \"related to the prohibitions against unnecessary suffering and poison\".\nThe memo also pointed out that DU weapons were \"incendiary\" and could have indiscriminate impacts in urban areas. \"They may cause fires which spread thereby causing potential risks of disproportionate injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects,\" it said. \"Precautions to avoid or minimise such risks shall be taken in the use of this weapon or alternate available weapons should be used.\"\nPAX estimates that there are more than 300 sites in Iraq contaminated by DU, which will cost at least $30m to clean up. DU is a chemically toxic and radioactive heavy metal attractive to weapons designers because it is extremely hard and can pierce armour.\nThe author of the PAX report, Wim Zwijnenburg, said the US Air Force knew the harm that could be done by DU weapons and should not have used them in populated areas. \"The use of DU against these targets questions the adherence of coalition forces to their own principles and guidelines,\" he argued. \"They should be held accountable for the consequences.\"\nUS forces gave the GPS coordinates of DU rounds, along with a list of targets and the numbers fired, to the Dutch Ministry of Defence, which was concerned about areas in which its troops were stationed last year.\nThe Dutch MoD then released the data to PAX in response to a request under freedom of information law. The release of the information was a \"useful first step towards greater transparency\", said PAX, but the firing coordinates for most DU rounds remain unknown.\nMore than 300,000 DU rounds are estimated to have been fired during the 2003 Iraq war, the vast majority by US forces. A small fraction were from UK tanks, the coordinates for which were provided to the UN Environment Programme. A further 782,414 DU rounds are believed to have been fired during the earlier conflict in 1991, mostly by US forces.\nThe Democratic congressman, Jim McDermott, is now urging the US Department of Defence to publish all its DU firing coordinates. \"These weapons have had terrible health ramifications for Iraqi civilians,\" he said. \"The least the US could do is provide the specific targeting data so the Iraqi government can begin the complex clean-up process.\"\nThe US Department of Defence did not respond to a request to comment.

      "text": "Abstract\nExposure to heavy metals in contaminated drinking water is strongly correlated with various cancers, highlighting the burden of disease. This study aimed to assess the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks associated with exposure to heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in drinking water of Fars province and evaluate the attributed burden of disease. Non-carcinogenic risk assessment was performed using the hazard quotient (HQ) method, while the carcinogenic risk assessment utilized the excess lifetime cancer risk approach. The burden of disease was evaluated in terms of years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for three specific cancers: skin, lung, and kidney cancer. The average drinking water concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) were determined to be 0.72, 0.4, 1.10 and 0.72 \u03bcg/L, respectively. The total average HQ of heavy metals in drinking water in the study area were 0.127, 0.0047, 0.0009 and 0.0069, respectively. The average ILCRs of heavy metal in the entire country were in the following order: 1.15 \u00d7 10\u22125 for As, 2.22 \u00d7 10\u22127 for Cd and 3.41 \u00d7 10\u22127 for Cr. The results also indicated that among the various counties analyzed, Fasa experiences the greatest burden of disease in terms of DALYs, with a value of 87.56, specifically attributed to cancers caused by exposure to arsenic. Generally, it can be said that the burden of disease is a critical aspect of public health that requires comprehensive understanding and effective intervention.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nProviding safe and adequate drinking water plays an important role in health promotion and reducing the environmental burden of disease. Universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 have been considered as the Sustainable Development Goal target 6.1. However, the presence of heavy metal contamination in drinking water sources has become a pressing global concern. Heavy metals, such as arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), can can enter water sources through natural geological processes or human activities such as mining, industrial discharge, and improper waste disposal,posing significant health risks to populations worldwide1,2.\nLong-term exposure to heavy metals in drinking water, such as arsenic, cadmium, and chromium, has consistently been linked to various cancers like skin, lung, and kidney cancer3. These metals can enter water naturally or through human activities, gradually accumulating over time and posing significant health risks. Their buildup in the body leads to chronic toxicity, disrupting normal cellular functions, causing organ damage, weakening the immune system, and increasing susceptibility to diseases. Areas with contaminated drinking water face serious public health challenges, emphasizing the urgent need to reduce exposure to these well-known human carcinogens and protect overall population health4,5. The recommended drinking water standards set by regulatory bodies for heavy metals are as follows: 10 \u00b5g/L for As, 3 \u00b5g/L for Cd, 10 \u00b5g/L for Pb, and 50 \u00b5g/L for Cr6,7,8.\nProlonged exposure to specific heavy metals has been correlated with the onset of various cancers, including those affecting the skin, lungs, and kidneys. The gradual buildup of these metals within the body can lead to persistent toxic effects. Even minimal exposure levels can result in their gradual accumulation in tissues, disrupting normal cellular operations and heightening the likelihood of diseases, particularly cancers9,10. Extended contact with elevated levels of arsenic in drinking water is linked to escalated risks of cancers, cardiovascular ailments, neurodevelopmental disorders, and unfavorable reproductive outcomes. Likewise, exposure to cadmium has been associated with cancers affecting the lungs, prostate, kidneys, and breasts, with the World Health Organization (WHO) designating cadmium as a confirmed human carcinogen. Taking action to mitigate heavy metal contamination in drinking water sources is imperative for safeguarding public health from these detrimental repercussions. One widely adopted gauge for quantifying the impact of diseases and risk factors on overall population health is the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) metric6,11,12.\nThe burden of disease refers to the overall impact of a particular health condition on a population, encompassing not only mortality but also morbidity and the social and economic consequences of illness. The use of the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) metric in evaluating the risk and burden of disease caused by exposure to heavy metals through drinking water is of utmost significance in the field of public health. The DALY combines two components: years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD)13. YLL represents the number of years lost due to premature death, while YLD accounts for the years lived with a disability or in a less than optimal health state. By summing these components, DALY provides a comprehensive estimation of the overall impact of a particular disease or risk factor on a population14,15. By encompassing a wide range of health outcomes, including physical, psychological, and social dimensions of diseases, DALY offers a comprehensive measure of the societal impact resulting from heavy metal exposure.\nThis approach aids in prioritizing interventions and allocating resources effectively to address identified health risks16,17. To date, several studies have reported associations between long-term exposure to certain heavy metals and the development of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders, and adverse reproductive outcomes. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of studies that specifically address Iranian provinces, despite the distinctive environmental and socio-economic factors in the country that could potentially affect the presence of heavy metals in drinking water sources18,19. By conducting this evaluation in different parts of Iran, we can contribute valuable insights to the limited body of knowledge on heavy metal exposure and its health consequences in this context. Furthermore, while previous studies have recognized the importance of the DALY metric in assessing the burden of disease, few have applied it directly to heavy metal exposure through drinking water20,21.This approach allows us to compare the burden of disease caused by heavy metal exposure to other health risks, prioritize interventions, and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of preventive measures.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy area\nFars province, situated in the southwest of Iran, encompasses an area of 122,400 km2. It shares its borders with six adjacent provinces: Isfahan to the north, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad to the west, Bushehr to the south, Hormozgan to the southwest, and Yazd and Kerman to the east. The topography of Fars province is marked by diverse features, including mountain ranges, deserts, and fertile plains. Mount Dena, towering at an impressive height of 4409 m, stands as the highest peak in the region. Figure 1 presents the geographical map of the study area, highlighting the Fars province in southwest Iran.\nThe geological composition of Fars province comprises various formations, including Fars, Aghajari, Bakhtiari, Bangestan, and Sachun. These formations consist of marl, limestone, gypsum, andesite, sandstone, and limestone, respectively. This geological diversity plays a crucial role in the hydrogeological dynamics of the region. Additionally, the province features several significant rivers, including the Kor River and the Dez River.\nWith an approximate population of 4.9 million people, Fars province is primarily inhabited by Persian communities. The climate exhibits regional variations, with moderate conditions prevailing in the northern areas, while the southern regions experience hot and arid climates. The average annual rainfall stands at around 330 mm, with higher precipitation occurring in mountainous areas. It is noteworthy that the province experiences considerable temperature fluctuations due to climate variability. For instance, colder regions witness temperatures ranging from \u2212 15 \u00b0C during the cold season to 26 \u00b0C during the hot season, while hotter and drier regions experience temperatures ranging from 4 \u00b0C to a scorching 48 \u00b0C during the respective seasons. These climatic factors contribute to the unique environmental characteristics of Fars province, which are crucial considerations in assessing water-related issues and their impact on public health. The groundwater level in the region has undergone a significant transition, decreasing from 1545 m in 2004 to less than 200 m in the year of conducting this study, 2021. This substantial alteration in groundwater levels underscores the dynamic nature of the hydrogeological system in Fars province, emphasizing its relevance in the context of the research conducted.\nFurthermore, it is imperative to highlight that a substantial portion of the population in Fars province relies on well groundwater for their drinking water needs, accounting for approximately 79 percent of the available resources (Iran Water Resources Management Company, [Year]). This reliance underscores the critical importance of assessing heavy metal pollution in well groundwater sources, as it directly impacts a significant segment of the population. Given this context, our research plays a crucial role in evaluating the associated health risks and providing essential insights for public health interventions and policy decisions.\nSampling and data collection\nWater samples were collected from a total of 569 wells in the drinking water supply system of 28 cities located within Fars province (Fig. 1). At each sampling point, two separate water samples were collected using 2-L polyethylene containers. Prior to sampling, the water was allowed to flow for 2 min, and the sampling bottles were carefully filled. One bottle was filled without the addition of acid and bubbles, while the other bottle was rinsed with a solution of double-distilled water and nitric acid in a 1:1 ratio. The pH of the samples was adjusted to less than 2 using pure nitric acid (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to minimize the absorption of heavy metals in the container lining and stabilize microbial activity. Following sample collection, the water samples were transferred to the laboratory while maintaining a temperature of 4 \u00b0C.\nThe heavy metal concentration data for drinking water in both rural and urban communities were obtained from the 2020 drinking water quality database of the Center of Environmental and Occupational Health, Ministry of Health and Medical Education. This database is not publicly accessible. The selected heavy metals for this study were arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) due to their severe health effects and potential presence in high concentrations in drinking water. The collection of drinking water samples for heavy metal measurements was conducted seasonally by environmental health officers throughout the country. The total number of drinking water samples collected for heavy metal measurements was approximately 569, with sample sizes in each community proportionate to the population. The heavy metal measurements were performed using the atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) in water quality laboratories of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, following the instructions outlined in the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater2,22.\nTo ensure data quality, the measurement data of heavy metal concentrations underwent a cleaning process based on the methods described by. Outliers were identified and removed from the dataset. Subsequently, the heavy metal concentration data were categorized by community, and the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of heavy metal concentrations in drinking water were calculated. These calculated values were utilized to assess the exposure dose, health risk, and attributable burden of disease associated with heavy metal contamination in the study area23,24.\nChemical analysis\nIn the chemical analysis section, the collected water samples were subjected to rigorous laboratory testing to determine the concentrations of heavy metals and other relevant physical and chemical parameters. The analysis of heavy metals, including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb), was conducted using established methods (atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS)) in accordance with the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater22. These methods provide accurate and reliable measurements of heavy metal concentrations in water samples. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis, several quality control measures were implemented. Standard samples and controls were analyzed after every 10 samples to assess the reliability and repeatability of the analysis. These measures help in identifying any potential variations or inconsistencies in the results, thereby ensuring the overall quality of the data. The analysis of the contaminant contents in the water samples was conducted using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin Elmer AA-Analyst 200), which is a reliable method for precise measurements of the concentration levels of contaminants. It is important to note that the utilization of double-distilled water and the preparation of standard solutions contribute to the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. These steps minimize any potential interference or contamination during the analysis process, ensuring that the obtained results are representative of the actual concentrations of the contaminants in the water samples8,25.\nRisk assessment\nRisk management involves assessing the probability of an incident occurrence and the potential adverse health effects on humans and other animals exposed to environmental risk factors. Risk assessmnet was calculated using the modified Eqs. (1) and (2) provided below to estimate the average daily dose (ADD) of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic elements:2,4.\nwhere ADDc: The average daily dose (carcinogenic elements (mg/kg/day)), ADDnc: The average daily dose (non-carcinogenic elements (mg/kg/day)), C: The contamination concentration (mg/L), RBA: Relative biological availability, IR: The ingestion rate (L/day), EDc: The exposure duration (carsinogenic), Ednc: The exposure duration (non-carcinogenic), BW: The body weight (kg), ATc: The average time for cancer risk assessment (day), ATnc: The average time for non-cancer risk assessment (day).\nTable 1 provides an overview of the exposure parameters considered in the risk assessment calculations.\nIn developing countries, especially those with warmer climates, the amount of water used as a criterion to calculate exposure differs significantly from the values of water indicators used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to determine the guideline values for drinking water pollutants. Hence, this study leveraged water usage data from Khan's study, which pertains to a geographically proximate area, and integrated local demographic information such as age and weight. This approach was adopted to mitigate potential inaccuracies. The Exposure Frequency (EF) was determined based on recommendations from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The life expectancy at birth was considered as 70 years, corresponding to an average life of 2550 days27,28.\nNon-carcinogenic risk assessment\nNon-carcinogenic risk assessment is an essential component of this study, aiming to evaluate the potential health risks posed by the metals present in drinking water. It is as assessed using a non-carcinogenic risk factor known as the Hazard Quotient (HQ), which is calculated as follows:\nADDnc: The average daily dose of metal in drinking water for non-carcinogenic elements (mg/kg/day), RFD: Reference dose (\u00b5g/kg/day), RSC: Relative source contribution.\nThe reference for metal\u2019s doses, As, Cr, Pb, and Cd are presented (Tables 1, 2). If the HQ is more than 1 there is the possibility of non-carcinogenic effects on health, while if HQ is less than or equal to 1 is likely residents will not be considered of any health risks resulting of exposure to the elements29,30,31.\nCarcinogenic risk assessment\nCarcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk assessments are essential components of this study, focusing on the evaluation of potential health risks associated with chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), as well as lead (Pb) as a non-carcinogenic element. The classification of these elements as carcinogens and the non-carcinogenic risks are based on the guidelines provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)26,32,33.To assess the carcinogenic risk, parameters such as the oral reference dose (RfD) and oral slope factor (CSF) are considered for chromium, cadmium, and arsenic, as presented in Table 2. These values provide insights into the potential cancer risks associated with exposure to these elements4,34,35.\nThe carcinogenic potential of these elements is determined by calcualating the excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) using the following formula:\nwhere ELCR: Excess lifetime cancer risk, ADDc: Average daily doses (mg/kg/day), CSF: Cancer slope factor) mg/kg/day).\nBy calculating the ELCR, we can estimate the excess risk of developing cancer over a lifetime due to exposure to the identified carcinogenic elements. The calculated ELCR will be compared to the acceptable maximum risk suggested by the USEPA, which is \u2264 1 \u00d7 10\u20136. If the calculated ELCR exceeds this threshold, it indicates a potential health risk to the exposed residents. Additionally, the non-carcinogenic risk assessment includes lead (Pb), which is not considered a carcinogen through the ingestion pathway of drinking water. The potential non-carcinogenic risks associated with lead exposure will be evaluated using the hazard quotient (HQ) approach, calculated as described earlier (Eq. 3)39,40,41.\nBurdn of desease attributable to heavy metals\nThe burden of disease associated with the intake of heavy metals through drinking water was assessed in terms of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY)42. For precise estimation of the disease burden linked to heavy metal exposure, a two-stage disease model was deployed. This model encompasses a treatment phase and a subsequent mortality phase for the associated cancers. This model provided a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of heavy metal exposure on the development and outcomes of specific cancers.The treatment phase of the disease model consisted of two distinct stages: 1. Diagnosis and treatment, and 2. remission to cure.\nDuring the diagnosis and treatment stage, individuals undergo medical examinations, receive appropriate treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, and work towards suppressing the cancerous growth. After undergoing successful treatment, individuals progress into the remission-to-cure stage, characterized by a period of recuperation and vigilant monitoring to verify the absence of cancer recurrence43,44,45. The death phase of the disease model incorporated multiple stages that reflect the progressive nature of cancer and its ultimate outcome46. It encompassed: 1. The diagnosis and treatment stage, similar to the treatment phase, as individuals may continue to receive medical interventions in an effort to manage the disease, 2. The remission to death stage acknowledged the unfortunate scenario where cancer reemerges despite prior remission efforts, leading to a deterioration of health and eventual mortality47,48, 3. The pre-final phase showed the advanced stage of the disease, where individuals may experience severe symptoms and complications, necessitating palliative care and supportive treatments, Finally, 4. the final phase denoted the terminal stage of the disease, reflecting the end-of-life period characterized by significant decline in overall health16,49,50.\nBy incorporating these distinct phases into the disease model, a more detailed and realistic assessment of the burden of disease resulting from heavy metal exposure was achieved. This approach offered comprehensive insights into the complete trajectory of cancer, encompassing initial diagnosis, treatment, potential remission, and the subsequent progression ultimately culminating in mortality. This approach allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of heavy metal exposure on different stages of cancer and facilitated a more accurate estimation of the associated burden of disease.The YLL, YLD, and DALY parameters were calculated by the following equations14:\nwhere DALYi,s,r (y): The disability-adjusted life years induced by exposure to heavy metal i through drinking water for sex s in region r, YLLi,s,r (y): The years of life lost due to premature mortality induced by exposure to heavy metal i through drinking water for sex s in region r, YLDi,s,r (y): The years lived with disability induced by exposure to heavy metal i through drinking water for sex s in region r, Ps,r (person): Population of the study area, SRc (dimensionless): The survival rate of cancer c, L (y): Life expectancy in the study area (74.2 y), As,r: Average age in the population of the study area (32.5 y), Dc,dt, Dc,rc, Dc,rd, Dc,pt, and Dc,t: Respectively; the duration of diagnosis and treatment phase of cancer c, duration of remission to cure phase of cancer c, duration of remission to death phase of cancer c, duration of the pre-final phase of cancer c, and duration of the final phase of cancer c, DWc,dt, DWc,rc, DWc,rd, DWc,pt, and DWc,t: Respectively; the disability weight of diag- nosis and treatment phase of cancer c, disability weight of remission to cure phase of cancer c, disability weight of remission to death phase of cancer c, disability weight of pre-final phase of cancer c, and disability weight of final phase of cancer c.\nIn summary, YLL focuses on premature mortality, capturing the years of life lost due to early death caused by heavy metal-related cancers. Years of Life Lost (YLL) are computed based on the population that is at risk or affected by a specific health condition or cause of death. On the other hand, YLD focuses on the impact of disability caused by heavy metal-related cancers, capturing the years individuals live with compromised health and functioning. These measures collectively help assess the burden of disease associated with heavy metal exposure and inform public health interventions and policies14,51,52.\nStatistical analysis\nAll calculations such as average, standard deviation and ranges for the target parameters was done by using the Excel 2010 software. Statistical analysis such as correlation analysis was done by SPSS.V.11.5 software. Map of the study area was made using ARC GIS.V 10.4.\nResults and discussion\nConcentration of heavy metals\nThe results exhibit variations in mean and range values across different counties, indicating spatial differences in heavy metal contamination. The presence of heavy metals in drinking water can originate from various sources. Industrial activities, including mining, metal production, and waste disposal, are common culprits. The concentrations of heavy metals, including Arsenic (As), Lead (Pb), Chromium (Cr), and Cadmium (Cd) is presented in Table 3.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has established maximum acceptable limits for As, Pb, Cr, and Cd in drinking water, set at 10, 50, 10, and 3 \u00b5g/L, respectively. According to the data in Table 3, the concentrations of As, Pb, Cr, and Cd in the studied counties were generally within acceptable ranges based on the WHO. In terms of As concentration, the mean values ranged from 0.26 (Pasrgad) to 1.42 (Fasa) across the different counties. Although no values exceeded the WHO guideline of 10 \u00b5g/L, some counties, such as Jahrom, Fasa, and Sarvestan exhibited relatively higher concentrations compared to other areas. However, it is important to consider that some counties exhibit slightly higher concentrations. The concentrations ranged from 0.14 to 3.75 \u00b5g/L for Pb, 0.39 to 3.54 \u00b5g/L for Cr, and 0.01 to 1.7 \u00b5g/L for Cd. While no values exceeded the WHO standard, it is crucial to remain vigilant and implement measures to prevent any future increase in heavy metal concentrations. The graph presented in Fig. 2 illustrates a comparison between the concentrations of As, Pb, Cr, and Cd in the studied counties and the corresponding WHO standards. This graph provides a visual representation of the extent to which the heavy metal concentrations comply with the recommended limits.\nThe origins of heavy metal contamination in the study area necessitate additional scrutiny. Potential sources may include industrial operations such as mining, metal production, and waste disposal, as well as agricultural practices involving the use of fertilizers containing heavy metals or the use of contaminated irrigation water. Furthermore, historical land use patterns could also serve as contributing factors to heavy metal contamination. Natural geological processes, such as leaching from rocks and soils, can also introduce heavy metals into water sources. Identifying these sources will aid in developing effective pollution prevention and control strategies to safeguard the health of the local population.the relatively narrow range of heavy metal concentrations observed in our study area can be attributed to several factors, including similar geological and environmental conditions, potential pollution sources, spatial proximity to neighboring regions, and the sampling design employed. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the local factors influencing heavy metal contamination and provide valuable insights into the current status of heavy metal pollution in our study area.The study by Radfard et.al and also Mirzabeygi et.al et al. examined heavy metal contamination in nearby regions and reported comparable concentrations for Arsenic, Lead, Chromium, and Cadmium. These findings align with our results and provide additional evidence of the current status of heavy metal contamination in our study area2,4.\nSaptial distribution of heavy metals\nTo facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution and visualize the concentrations, Geographic Information System (GIS) technology was employed. GIS offers a powerful tool for analyzing and presenting spatial data, allowing us to map the concentrations of heavy metals across different counties or regions. These zoning maps can assist in identifying areas that require closer monitoring and potential remediation efforts. According to Fig. 3, the measured concentrations of As range from 0.19 to 3.2 \u00b5g/L, while Cr concentrations range from 0.39 \u00b5g/L in Shiraz to 3.54 \u00b5g/L. The results also indicated that the concentrations of Cd vary between 0.01to 1.7 \u00b5g/L, with the highest levels observed in Marvdasht. Similarly, Pb concentrations range from 0.14 \u00b5g/l to 3.7 \u00b5g/l, with the highest levels found in Grash.These values reflect the varying levels of heavy metal contamination across different regions.\nWhile the concentrations of all analyzed heavy metals in the study area are within acceptable limits, it is important to remain vigilant about the adverse health effects that these heavy metals can pose even at low levels of exposure. Totaly, our study provides comprehensive information on the concentrations of heavy metals in the study area, as well as their spatial distribution depicted through the GIS zoning map. While the recorded concentrations fall below the WHO guidelines, it is essential to recognize the potential health risks associated with heavy metal exposure in future investigations.\nHeavy metal health risk assessment\nNon-carsinogenic risk assessment\nThe non-carcinogenic health risk assessment for heavy metals in drinking water was conducted using the Average Daily Dose (ADD) parameter, which was calculated using the modified Eq. 2. The equation takes into account factors such as contamination concentration (C), Relative Biological Availability (RBA), ingestion rate (IR), exposure duration (ED), body weight (BW), and average time for non-cancer risk assessment (ATnc). Figure 4 presents the results of HQ values of heavy metals (As, Pb, Cr, and Cd) in different counties.\nIn non-carcinogenic risk assessment of heavy metals, the hazard quotient (HQ) is a fundamental parameter used to evaluate the potential health risks associated with exposure to these substances. The Hazard Quotient (HQ) was calculated using the ADDnc (average daily dose of metal in drinking water for non-carcinogenic elements), Reference Dose (RFD), and Relative Source Contribution (RSC)7. HQ represents the ratio between the estimated exposure dose of a chemical and a reference dose (RfD) or a safe exposure limit established by regulatory agencies. The reference dose (RfD) is derived from toxicological studies and represents an estimate of the daily exposure level to a chemical that is unlikely to cause adverse health effects over a lifetime of exposure. It is usually based on the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) or the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) determined from animal or human studies. The RfD takes into account factors such as uncertainty and variability in the data to ensure a conservative and protective estimate of safe exposure53.\nIt is crucial to highlight that the Hazard Quotient (HQ) methodology is frequently employed for non-carcinogenic risk assessment, as it specifically addresses potential adverse health effects apart from cancer. Carcinogenic risks linked with heavy metals are typically evaluated through distinct approaches, such as the utilization of cancer slope factors. If the resulting HQ value is greater than 1, it indicates a potential health risk, suggesting that the exposure dose of the chemical may exceed the safe limit set by the RfD54. HQ values were calculated for arsenic (HQ-As), lead (HQ-Pb), chromium (HQ-Cr), and cadmium (HQ-Cd). Arsenic levels, as measured by the HQ-As parameter, ranged from 0.046 to 0.251, which are relatively low.\nThe highest HQ-As value was observed in the county of Fasa (0.2513), indicating a relatively higher potential health risk associated with arsenic exposure in this area. On the other hand, the lowest HQ-As value was found in the county of Pasargad (0.0467), suggesting a comparatively lower risk of arsenic contamination7,55.\nExposure to elevated levels of arsenic can lead to adverse health effects such as increased cancer risk (skin, lung, bladder, kidney), cardiovascular diseases, respiratory problems, skin lesions, developmental issues in children, impacts on the nervous system, and negative effects on the liver, kidneys, and immune system56. Adhering to acceptable limits and minimizing exposure to arsenic are important for reducing these risks. Based on the our results, it could be observed that the HQ values are low and the concentration of arsenic is below the acceptable limits set by the WHO standard7. So the potential adverse health effects associated with arsenic exposure are generally considered to be minimal. The low HQ values indicate that the exposure to arsenic is unlikely to cause significant adverse health effects. However, it is essential to consider that long-term exposure to any level of arsenic may still have cumulative effects over time57.\nLead levels, as indicated by the HQ-Pb parameter, ranged from 0.002 to 0.024. The county of Grash exhibited the highest HQ-Pb valueaand the Pasargad showed the lowest HQ-Pb value, indicating a relatively lower risk of lead contamination. HQ-Cr parameter, ranged from 5.11837E\u221204 to 1.24469E\u221203. The county of Farashband demonstrated the highest HQ-Cr value, indicating a potential source of chromium pollution compare to other regions. HQ levels of Cd ranged from 0.001 (Kharameh) to 0.01 (Pasargad). Lead exposure can result in various adverse health effects, including neurological damage, developmental issues, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular problems, kidney damage, reproductive issues, and increased blood pressure.\nHigh levels of chromium can lead to lung, nasal, and sinus cancer, respiratory problems, skin irritation, as well as liver and kidney damage. Cadmium exposure is associated with kidney damage, respiratory issues, weakened bone health, increased risk of lung cancer, and impacts on the cardiovascular and reproductive systems. The results of our study indicate that the concentrations of arsenic, lead, chromium, and cadmium in the studied area are within the acceptable limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Scientific databases and previous research also support our findings, showing that exposure to these heavy metals at the observed levels is unlikely to cause significant adverse health effects. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the potential health risks associated with heavy metal exposure can vary depending on factors such as individual susceptibility, duration of exposure, and cumulative effects over time. Therefore, continuous monitoring and regular assessments of heavy metal levels in the environment and human populations are necessary to ensure the long-term health and well-being of the community. Additionally, further research and epidemiological studies are warranted to explore any potential subtle or long-term health effects that may arise from chronic exposure to low levels of these heavy metals.\nCarcinogenic risk assessment\nIn the field of toxicology, the carcinogenic risk assessment of heavy metals is often quantified using the Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk (ELCR) approach. The ELCR is a measure of the additional risk of developing cancer over a lifetime due to exposure to a particular carcinogenic substance, in this case, heavy metals. HQ and ELCR are both important metrics used in risk assessment, but they serve different purposes and assess different health outcomes. Indeed, the Hazard Quotient (HQ) primarily concentrates on non-cancer health effects, gauging the estimated exposure against a predetermined safe threshold level. Conversely, the Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk (ELCR) is specifically designed to assess the supplementary lifetime risk of developing cancer due to exposure to a carcinogenic substance58. The ELCR is calculated using the Average Daily Dose (ADD) and the Cancer Slope Factor (CSF). The Cancer Slope Factor (CSF) is a value determined through toxicological studies and represents the potency of a specific carcinogenic substance. It quantifies the increased cancer risk associated with a unit increase in the average daily dose of the heavy metal. Figure 5 presents ELCRs values of heavy metals (AS, Pb, Cr, and Cd) in different counties.\nGenerally, ELCR values below 1 in a million (10\u22126) are considered low risk, indicating a relatively low likelihood of developing cancer. ELCR values between 1 in a million and 1 in 10,000 (10\u22126 to 10\u22124) are considered moderate risk, while values above 1 in 10,000 (10\u22124) are considered high risk. As seen in Fig. 5, findings revealed significant variations in the carcinogenic risk levels across the studied counties. Arsenic, a highly toxic heavy metal in this study, exhibited varying levels of cancer risk. Among the three heavy metals, arsenic demonstrates the highest mean ELCR value of 1.672 \u00d7 10\u22125. Arsenic is a well-known carcinogen and is linked to various types of cancer, including skin, lung, bladder, and liver cancer. The elevated mean ELCR value for arsenic underscores the urgent need for effective mitigation strategies and stricter regulations to reduce exposure and protect the population from the associated cancer risks7.\nThe chromium exhibits a lower mean ELCR value of 3.494 \u00d7 10\u22127. This suggests a relatively lower cancer risk associated with chromium exposure compared to arsenic. Nonetheless, it remains crucial to acknowledge that chromium exposure continues to be a substantial concern, given its established association with an elevated risk of lung cancer. Mitigation measures and proper monitoring should be implemented to minimize exposure and reduce the potential cancer risks associated with chromium.\nCadmium, on the other hand, shows the lowest mean ELCR value among the studied heavy metals, with a value of 2.272 \u00d7 10\u22127. This indicates a relatively lower cancer risk associated with cadmium exposure compared to others. However, it is crucial to remain vigilant as cadmium exposure has been linked to lung and prostate cancer. Effective management practices, such as reducing cadmium emissions, implementing safety measures in industrial settings, and promoting awareness, should be prioritized to further minimize the cancer risks associated with cadmium.\nOverall, the results of the carcinogenic risk assessment highlight the spatial variability in the potential health risks associated with heavy metal exposure. These findings can contribute to informed decision-making, such as implementing appropriate mitigation strategies and establishing guidelines to minimize the risks posed by these contaminants. Further research and monitoring efforts are essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the extent and implications of heavy metal contamination on human health in these areas. Furthermore, when comparing the results of this study with similar investigations conducted worldwide, it is evident that heavy metal contamination in drinking water is a global concern.\nSeveral studies have reported elevated levels of carcinogenic heavy metals in different regions, emphasizing the need for comprehensive risk assessments and appropriate mitigation strategies59. The analysis of cancer risks reveals that certain counties exhibit excess lifetime cancer risks (ELCR) above the acceptable maximum risk suggested by the USEPA, which is \u2264 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 (USEPA, 2021). Among the counties studied, Arsanjan, Estheban, and Khoram bid demonstrate higher cancer risks associated with heavy metal exposure. These findings highlight the potential adverse health effects of the investigated heavy metals in drinking water and the importance of implementing measures to reduce their levels. The probable sources of heavy metal contamination in drinking water warrant further investigation.\nAlthough this study did not directly target the identification of specific sources, it is imperative to investigate potential contributors, such as industrial operations, agricultural practices, and geological characteristics. Prior research conducted in diverse regions around the world has pointed to several origins of heavy metal contamination, including mining operations, wastewater discharge, and natural weathering processes. Understanding these sources can aid in implementing targeted interventions to mitigate heavy metal pollution in drinking water. Overall, these mean ELCR values provide valuable information for policymakers, health authorities, and communities to prioritize interventions, regulations, and public health initiatives aimed at minimizing the potential cancer risks associated with heavy metal exposure4,60,61.\nBurden of disease\nThe burden of disease in the assessment of heavy metals (such as As, Pb, Cr, Cd) in drinking water refers to the health impact and negative consequences that arise from the exposure to these specific metals through the consumption of contaminated water. When evaluating the burden of disease, it involves assessing the extent of heavy metal contamination in drinking water sources, estimating the population exposed to these metals, and examining the associated health effects. Heavy metals can have toxic effects on various organ systems in the body, leading to a range of health conditions and diseases. The burden of cancer in the study region was assessed using three key measures: Years of Life Lost (YLL), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY). The results provide important insights into the impact of cancer on premature death and disability in different counties. DALY takes into account not only the years of life lost due to premature death (YLL) but also the years lived with disability (YLD). YLL captures the loss of potential years of life resulting from premature mortality, while YLD quantifies the years lived with a disability or in a less than optimal health state. Table 4 presents the Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to different types of cancer across the counties included in the study16,20,43.\nYLL represents the number of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality caused by each type of cancer. It represents the number of years that individuals would have lived if they had not died prematurely due to a specific cause. The table provides specific YLL values for skin cancer, lung cancer, and kidney cancer. The YLL values range from a minimum of 1.05 years for skin cancer to a maximum of 54.65 years for lung cancer. The maximum YLL values indicate that lung cancer has the most significant impact on premature mortality, resulting in a substantial loss of potential years of life. This finding highlights the importance of implementing effective strategies for prevention, early detection, and treatment of lung cancer in the affected counties. The average YLL values provide an overview of the overall impact of cancer on life expectancy in the counties14,34,42.\nYLD (Years of Life with Disability) measures the burden of non-fatal health outcomes due to a particular condition. It quantifies the number of years lived with a disability caused by a specific disease, such as cancer. Table 5 presents the YLD values for different types of cancer in the studied counties. It provides insight into the specific years lived with disability for each cancer type.\nAccording to this table, certain regions, such as Arsanjan, Jahram, and Sarvestan, exhibit consistently higher YLD values across all three cancer types. For example, Arsanjan has relatively high YLD values for skin cancer (1.146), lung cancer (1.462), and kidney cancer (1.527). These findings indicate a greater burden of disease and highlight the need for targeted interventions and resources in these areas. When comparing YLD values within each county, lung cancer consistently demonstrates higher YLD values compared to skin and kidney cancer. This suggests that lung cancer may have a more substantial impact on disability within the studied regions. On the other hand, Pasargad and Shiraz have lower YLD values for these cancer types. These differences may indicate variations in disease prevalence, healthcare access, or risk factors among the counties. Understanding these differences can aid in resource allocation and prioritizing healthcare initiatives tailored to the specific needs of each cancer type47.\nThe results of the DALY calculation for three prevalent cancer types across multiple counties have been presemted in Table 6. The table provides a comprehensive view of the disease burden within each region, taking into account both years of life lost due to premature death (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD).\nAs discussed later, the DALY metric combines the YLL and YLD values to provide a measure of the overall burden of disease, reflecting the impact on the population's health in terms of both mortality and disability. Through an examination of the DALY values, we can acquire valuable insights into the comparative burden of skin cancer, lung cancer, and kidney cancer within the counties under study. Based on the Table 6, it is evident that the DALY values vary for different cancer types within each county. The results indicate that among the various counties analyzed, Fasa experiences the greatest burden of disease in terms of DALYs, with a value of 87.56, specifically attributed to cancers caused by exposure to arsenic. DALYs represent the overall impact of a particular health condition, taking into account both years of life lost due to premature mortality and years lived with disability. In this context, Fasa stands out as having a higher number of DALYs compared to other counties, indicating a greater burden of disease associated with arsenic-related cancers. On the other hand, Pasrgad has the lowest DALYs, with a value of 16.27, attributed to cancers caused by exposure to arsenic, indicating a comparatively lower burden of cancer-related disability and premature death. The high value of DALYs in Fasa indicates that despite meeting the recommended limits, heavy metals may still have adverse health effects on the population. The elevated DALYs in Fasa could be attributed to various factors. It is paramount to scrutinize the particular heavy metals found in the drinking water and their respective concentrations. Given that different heavy metals exhibit varying levels of toxicity, even low concentrations can result in cumulative health effects over time. Consequently, an in-depth analysis of the types and concentrations of heavy metals present in Fasa's drinking water is imperative for identifying potential causative agents1,14,27.\nFurthermore, the health effects of heavy metals can be influenced by various factors, including exposure duration and individual susceptibility. Long-term exposure to low levels of heavy metals can lead to chronic health conditions and contribute to the DALYs observed. Additionally, certain subpopulations, such as children, pregnant women, or individuals with pre-existing health conditions, may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of heavy metals, resulting in a higher burden of disease. Moreover, considering other potential sources of heavy metal exposure is important. Apart from drinking water, individuals may be exposed to heavy metals through contaminated food, air pollution, or occupational hazards11,43.\nAssessing these additional exposure pathways can help identify the overall contribution of heavy metals to the DALYs in Fasa and also other studied areas.The table also provides information on DALYs and the corresponding cancers caused by exposure to Cr in drinking water across different counties. The data highlights variations in DALYs and cancer burden among the studied counties. Several observations can be made from the table. First, there is variability in the DALYs across different cancer types. For instance, lung cancer appears to have a higher DALY value compared to kidney and skin cancers. This suggests that Cr exposure in drinking water may have a more substantial impact on lung cancer incidence and associated disability. Farashband stands out with a relatively high DALY value of 1.922, indicating a significant burden of disease attributed to Cr-induced cancers in this area. Other counties, such as Shiraz and Zarin Dasht, exhibit relatively low DALY values. In order to the relatively low DALY values observed in counties like Shiraz and Zarin Dasht, despite exposure to Cr in drinking water, it is possible that the concentration of Cr in the drinking water sources of these counties is comparatively lower than in other areas. Lower Cr levels may result in reduced health risks and, consequently, lower DALY values associated with cancer incidence. Analyzing the specific Cr concentration levels in these counties\u2019 water sources could provide insights into the potential correlation between exposure levels and DALY outcomes24,56.\nSimilarly, about corresponding cancers caused by exposure to Cd in drinking water, the DALY values range from 0.330961 to 1.901714, indicating variations in disease burden. Counties like Zarindasht, Quar, and Grash have higher DALY values, indicating a greater burden of Cd-induced cancers. Factors such as Cd concentration in drinking water, county-specific characteristics, population demographics, and healthcare access contribute to the observed differences in DALY values. Counties with lower DALY values, such as Zarin Dasht, Fasa, and Farashband, may have lower Cd exposure levels or other factors contributing to reduced cancer incidence. Further research, including epidemiological surveys and health risk assessments, is needed to establish causal relationships and identify potential interventions for reducing the burden of Cd-induced cancers in these counties.\nIn broad terms, it can be asserted that comprehending the burden of disease is a pivotal facet of public health. This understanding necessitates comprehensive assessment and efficient intervention. Through the evaluation of diseases' impact on populations, policymakers and healthcare practitioners can allocate resources judiciously, formulate focused strategies, and institute preventative measures. The burden of disease framework, encompassing both morbidity and mortality, facilitates a comprehensive appraisal of the societal repercussions of diseases. Through continuous research, surveillance, and collaboration, we can strive to alleviate the burden of disease, improve health outcomes, and enhance the overall well-being of individuals and communities14,44,62.\nConclusion\nIn summary, our study provides a comprehensive assessment of the burden posed by skin cancer, lung cancer, and kidney cancer in the studied counties. By employing the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) metric, we have gained valuable insights into the overall impact of these cancer types on the population's health, considering both premature deaths and years lived with disability. This analysis revealed notable variations in disease burden across counties, suggesting distinct prevalence rates and impacts of these cancers in different geographic regions. Particularly, Fasa County emerged with a significantly higher burden, highlighting the urgency for targeted interventions and resource allocation to address these pressing health challenges.\nFurthermore, our age-specific analysis through DALY calculation offers nuanced insights into how these cancer types affect different age groups within the population. This underscores the importance of tailoring prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies to meet the specific needs of various age cohorts. Effective cancer control measures, including public awareness campaigns, early screening programs, improved healthcare access, and interventions targeting associated risk factors, are crucial in mitigating the burden of skin cancer, lung cancer, and kidney cancer. Overall, this study underscores the critical need for ongoing regional-level surveillance and monitoring of cancer burden. Such insights empower policymakers and healthcare professionals to allocate resources strategically, implement targeted interventions, and formulate effective strategies in the fight against these cancers.\nData availability\nThe data generated and analyzed during this study are available within the study.\nReferences\nAbbasnia, A. et al.

      "text": "Over 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to OCHA, which bases its figures on the Gaza Ministry of Health statistics, and more than 145,000 injured since October 7, 2023. Israeli forces began airstrikes and ground operations after Hamas and other armed groups launched a deadly ground incursion and rocket barrage on southern Israel. Reportedly, 50 of the over 200 hostages taken by Hamas are still held in Gaza.\nNearly two years of conflict have left over two million Palestinians, half of whom are children, without access to sufficient water, food or medical care. Famine has become a deadly reality, with catastrophic hunger tightening its grip across the population.\nA severe humanitarian crisis has taken hold in Gaza.\nThe International Rescue Committee (IRC) is calling on all parties to uphold international humanitarian law, protect civilians and critical infrastructure, and immediately scale up the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza. From a humanitarian perspective, a ceasefire is the best way to fully protect Palestinian lives, secure the release of hostages and enable the safe delivery of humanitarian aid.\nOur staff have witnessed catastrophic conditions firsthand and continue to deliver vital aid in Gaza\u2014including clean water, cash, early childhood education, protection\u2014despite harrowing safety concerns.\nWar has caused mass destruction in Gaza\nMore than 20 months of war have left Gaza in ruin. Israeli airstrikes, bombing and ground-level fighting between Israel and Hamas have killed over 60,000 Palestinians according to OCHA, destroyed critical infrastructure, including homes, hospitals, schools, shelters, religious sites and essential services like bakeries. With no place safe across the whole of Gaza, Palestinians are being pushed to the edge of survival, struggling to access food, clean water and life-saving medical services.\nOver 90% of homes in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, leaving the majority of Palestinians without a permanent and safe place to live. People are seeking refuge in tents or makeshift shelters that fail to provide safety or dignity.\nCivilians injured in the conflict and those suffering from everyday health problems are increasingly unable to access basic care. Almost half of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals are even partially functional\u2014and they\u2019re understaffed, lacking proper medical supplies and overwhelmed with patients. The IRC has more than 5 tonnes of life-saving medical supplies ready and waiting to enter Gaza, which will treat thousands of people and offer critical support to a health system already collapsing. Yet with Israel\u2019s current near-total blockade on access into Gaza, it remains uncertain as to when we will be able to deliver these supplies.\nChildren bear a disproportionate burden of the crisis. Beyond the immediate physical dangers, the psychological trauma of constant displacement, loss of family members and disrupted education can create lasting impacts that will affect an entire generation.\nWhy aren\u2019t Palestinians receiving enough aid?\nThe IRC is deeply concerned about the Israeli government\u2019s repeated decisions to prevent aid from entering Gaza at critical times, despite legal obligations under International Humanitarian Law to facilitate humanitarian aid delivery. Limited \u201ctactical pauses,\u201d aidrops and other symbolic gestures are dangerously inadequate in the face of Gaza\u2019s accelerating hunger crisis. Airdrops in particular are costly, inefficient, and incapable of meeting urgent needs.\nScenes of chaos and the killing of civilians have erupted during food distributions under the Israeli government\u2019s new aid scheme, implemented by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and private US security firms. This mode of delivering aid has proven not only ineffective but dangerous. The IRC has warned that these plans would lead to mass forced displacement of the civilian population, prevent vulnerable groups such as those with mobility issues and children from accessing aid, and make it nearly impossible to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nBob Kitchen, Vice President of Emergencies and Humanitarian Action at the IRC explains, \u201cGaza's entire population is currently reliant on humanitarian relief and blocking aid at a time when most of the population are already facing crisis levels of hunger will have far reaching consequences for an already desperate civilian population.\u201d\nDespite soaring costs of local goods and a near-total blockade and severe fuel shortages that are compounding the challenges of aid delivery, the IRC continues to deliver nutrition, clean water, sanitation and hygiene services, along with child protection in some of the hardest-hit areas. While the IRC\u2019s supplies inside Gaza are running low, we are pre-positioning vital stock outside Gaza, so we\u2019re ready to scale up the moment access is restored.\nFamine conditions have been surpassed in Gaza City\nThe entire population of Gaza is facing hunger. Markets are nearly empty, prices for staple goods have surged and families are being pushed to the limits of survival. The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) alert has confirmed the unthinkable: famine has taken hold in Gaza City. All three thresholds of famine\u2014catastrophic hunger, acute malnutrition, and mass death\u2014have been officially surpassed.\nThe worst-case scenario is unfolding across Gaza. In some areas, children share a single cucumber for the entire day\u2014or stop seeking aid because they\u2019re too weak to walk. These are the signs of starvation\u2019s brutal progression: the body shuts down, immunity collapses, and organs fail. This is not just hunger\u2014it\u2019s a slow, deliberate death by starvation.\nFamilies are starving, children are wasting away from severe acute malnutrition, and people are dying. IRC staff on the ground report families dividing a single piece of bread among five or six members, and children regularly having to go to sleep hungry.\nImmediate action is not just necessary\u2014it is a moral imperative.\nAbdelraheem Hamad, an IRC staff member inside Gaza, reports:\n\u201cPeople are collapsing in the streets from emaciation. One day, I saw a child digging through a pile of trash for food. He found nothing\u2014there are no scraps left. That moment captured the meaning of famine in a way words cannot describe. At home, I had only two loaves of bread to feed six people. We\u2019re not just witnessing hunger anymore\u2014this is starvation unfolding in real time.\u201d\nWith humanitarian aid barely being allowed to enter Gaza by Israel and ongoing hostilities putting our staff at risk, our nutrition programming has been heavily disrupted. Supplies of therapeutic food are running low, and reaching those already under treatment is becoming harder by the day.\n\u201cWithout immediate, unhindered humanitarian access and a ceasefire, more lives will be lost to starvation and disease,\u201d explains IRC CEO and president, David Miliband.\n\u201cThis is not a natural disaster, it is a man-made catastrophe, unfolding in full view of the world and entirely preventable.\u201d\nHow is the IRC helping Palestinians in Gaza?\nDespite the obstacles the IRC faces, we continue to reach Palestinians in need with vital services throughout the conflict and are saving lives every day. In collaboration with our local partners in Gaza, we supported the health, education, safety and economic wellbeing of more than 430,000 people since the beginning of the latest escalation of conflict. We are working to improve the lives of an additional 150,000 Palestinians by the end of 2025.\nSpecifically, the IRC is delivering:\n- Clean drinking water through water trucking;\n- Sanitation and hygiene services\u2014including building emergency latrines and distributing hygiene and menstruation management kits;\n- Direct cash assistance to help families meet their urgent needs;\n- Malnutrition counseling and treatment for children and their caregivers;\n- Protection programs that improve the safety and wellbeing of women and children;\n- Mental health and psychosocial support to children and their caregivers;\n- Early childhood development activities for children who have their lives uprooted.\nThe IRC has also delivered food and water to camps for displaced Palestinians, distributed food and supported emergency medical services in the few hospitals still operating.\nThe IRC\u2019s work in the West Bank\nIn the West Bank, the IRC and our partners are initiating early childhood development activities and support for children and families affected by violence. This includes mental health care, psychosocial support, and help for survivors of abuse, as well as training frontline workers to respond in a safe and respectful way.\nWe are also supporting the Ministry of Health in helping communities become more resilient. This involves improving access to health services, training health workers to identify protection concerns, and strengthening emergency preparedness. We're working closely with local partners to make sure efforts align with national plans, connect health services with protection support, and reach the areas most in need.\nHow can I help Gaza?\nNearly all civilians in Gaza are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Children are dying of starvation and disease. An immediate and lasting ceasefire\u2014and a vast increase in humanitarian aid\u2014is urgently needed to save lives.\nDonate: Despite restrictions on aid delivery, the IRC continues to reach Palestinians with lifesaving health care, cash, and emergency support. With operations in more than 40 countries around the world, your donation to the IRC will deliver critical aid where it's needed most.\n$80 can provide medical care for a malnourished child throughout the course of treatment.\n$250 can provide a family with the most essential necessities for survival for a month.\nStay connected: Follow the latest from the IRC and share posts from our Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Bluesky and X accounts with your network.\nRead more about the top 10 crises the world can\u2019t ignore in 2025 and learn more about the IRC's 2025 Emergency Watchlist."

Such was the case in the large-scale massacre that took place in the Gaza Strip in August 2014.\nThese weapons cause cancers and foetal malformations in the populations affected, which may take on epidemic proportions. In Iraq, in the city of Fallujah, where these bombs were launched in industrial quantities by the International Coalition led by the United States, 52% of children today are born with deformities.\nThe lethal effects of radioactivity caused by explosions and subsequent fires, including cancer of the lungs and pleura, can persist for centuries in the environment and particularly in aquifers. We are therefore on the verge of another humanitarian catastrophe in Palestine and in particular in the Gaza Strip, where thousands of tons of depleted uranium bombs were dropped with the effects that have already been documented.\nIn view of this situation, what is the Vice-President/High Representative thinking of doing to pressure Israel into assuming its responsibilities for this crime against humanity, and what help can the Vice-President/High Representative offer to the Palestinian authorities to carry out epidemiological monitoring, which also includes all EU citizens who have moved to the territory since then?"

      "text": "The Destruction of Falluja Was an Act of Barbarism that\nRanks alongside My Lai, Guernica and Halabja\nBy Mike Marqusee *\nGuardianNovember 10, 2005\nOne year ago this week, US-led occupying forces launched a devastating assault on the Iraqi city of Falluja. The mood was set by Lt Col Gary Brandl: \"The enemy has got a face. He's called Satan. He's in Falluja. And we're going to destroy him.\"\nThe assault was preceded by eight weeks of aerial bombardment. US troops cut off the city's water, power and food supplies, condemned as a violation of the Geneva convention by a UN special rapporteur, who accused occupying forces of \"using hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population\". Two-thirds of the city's 300,000 residents fled, many to squatters' camps without basic facilities.\nAs the siege tightened, the Red Cross, Red Crescent and the media were kept out, while males between the ages of 15 and 55 were kept in. US sources claimed between 600 and 6,000 insurgents were holed up inside the city - which means that the vast majority of the remaining inhabitants were non-combatants. On November 8, 10,000 US troops, supported by 2,000 Iraqi recruits, equipped with artillery and tanks, supported from the air by bombers and helicopter gunships, blasted their way into a city the size of Leicester. It took a week to establish control of the main roads; another two before victory was claimed.\nThe city's main hospital was selected as the first target, the New York Times reported, \"because the US military believed it was the source of rumours about heavy casualties\". An AP photographer described US helicopters killing a family of five trying to ford a river to safety. \"There were American snipers on top of the hospital shooting everyone,\" said Burhan Fasa'am, a photographer with the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation. \"With no medical supplies, people died from their wounds. Everyone in the street was a target for the Americans.\"\nThe US also deployed incendiary weapons, including white phosphorous. \"Usually we keep the gloves on,\" Captain Erik Krivda said, but \"for this operation, we took the gloves off\". By the end of operations, the city lay in ruins. Falluja's compensation commissioner has reported that 36,000 of the city's 50,000 homes were destroyed, along with 60 schools and 65 mosques and shrines.\nThe US claims that 2,000 died, most of them fighters. Other sources disagree. When medical teams arrived in January they collected more than 700 bodies in only one third of the city. Iraqi NGOs and medical workers estimate between 4,000 and 6,000 dead, mostly civilians - a proportionately higher death rate than in Coventry and London during the blitz.\nThe collective punishment inflicted on Falluja - with logistical and political support from Britain - was largely masked by the US and British media, which relied on reporters embedded with US troops. The BBC, in particular, offered a sanitised version of the assault: civilian suffering was minimised and the ethics and strategic logic of the attack largely unscrutinised.\nFalluja proved to be yet another of the war's phantom turning points. Violent resistance spread to other cities. In the last two months, Tal-Afar, Haditha, Husaybah - all alleged terrorist havens heavily populated by civilians - have come under the hammer. Falluja is still so heavily patrolled that visitors have described it as \"a giant prison\". Only a fraction of the promised reconstruction and compensation has materialised.\nLike Jallianwallah Bagh, Guernica, My Lai, Halabja and Grozny, Falluja is a place name that has become a symbol of unconscionable brutality. As the war in Iraq claims more lives, we need to ensure that this atrocity - so recent, so easily erased from public memory - is recognised as an example of the barbarism of nations that call themselves civilised.\nAbout the Author: Mike Marqusee is a co-founder of Iraq Occupation Focus\nMore Information on Siege Tactics and Attacks on Population Centers\nMore Information on Humanitarian Consequences of the War in Iraq\nMore Information on International Law Aspects of the Iraq War"

      "text": "Iraq: War\u2019s legacy of cancer\nTwo US-led wars in Iraq have left behind hundreds of tonnes of depleted uranium munitions and other toxic wastes.\nThis report contains photos of a graphic nature.\nFallujah, Iraq \u2013 Contamination from Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions and other military-related pollution is suspected of causing a sharp rises in congenital birth defects, cancer cases, and other illnesses throughout much of Iraq.\nMany prominent doctors and scientists contend that DU contamination is also connected to the recent emergence of diseases that were not previously seen in Iraq, such as new illnesses in the kidney, lungs, and liver, as well as total immune system collapse. DU contamination may also be connected to the steep rise in leukaemia, renal, and anaemia cases, especially among children, being reported throughout many Iraqi governorates.\nThere has also been a dramatic jump in miscarriages and premature births among Iraqi women, particularly in areas where heavy US military operations occurred, such as Fallujah.\nOfficial Iraqi government statistics show that, prior to the outbreak of the First Gulf War in 1991, the rate of cancer cases in Iraq was 40 out of 100,000 people. By 1995, it had increased to 800 out of 100,000 people, and, by 2005, it had doubled to at least 1,600 out of 100,000 people. Current estimates show the increasing trend continuing.\nAs shocking as these statistics are, due to a lack of adequate documentation, research, and reporting of cases, the actual rate of cancer and other diseases is likely to be much higher than even these figures suggest.\n\u201cCancer statistics are hard to come by, since only 50 per cent of the healthcare in Iraq is public,\u201d Dr Salah Haddad of the Iraqi Society for Health Administration and Promotion told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe other half of our healthcare is provided by the private sector, and that sector is deficient in their reporting of statistics. Hence, all of our statistics in Iraq must be multiplied by two. Any official numbers are likely only half of the real number.\u201d\nToxic environments\nDr Haddad believes there is a direct correlation between increasing cancer rates and the amount of bombings carried out by US forces in particular areas.\n\u201cMy colleagues and I have all noticed an increase in Fallujah of congenital malformations, sterility, and infertility,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Fallujah, we have the problem of toxics introduced by American bombardments and the weapons they used, like DU.\u201d\nDuring 2004, the US military carried out two massive military sieges of the city of Fallujah, using large quantities of DU ammunition, as well as white phosphorous.\n\u201cWe are concerned about the future of our children being exposed to radiation and other toxic materials the US military have introduced into our environment,\u201d Dr Haddad added.\nA frequently cited epidemiological study titled Cancer, Infant Mortality and Birth Sex-Ratio in Fallujah, Iraq 2005-2009 involved a door-to-door survey of more than 700 Fallujah households.\nThe research team interviewed Fallujans about abnormally high rates of cancer and birth defects.\nOne of the authors of the study, Chemist Chris Busby, said that the Fallujah health crisis represented \u201cthe highest rate of genetic damage in any population ever studied\u201d.\nDr Mozghan Savabieasfahani is an environmental toxicologist based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She is the author of more than two dozen peer reviewed articles, most of which deal with the health impact of toxicants and war pollutants. Her research now focuses on war pollution and the rising epidemic of birth defects in Iraqi cities.\n\u201cAfter bombardment, the targeted population will often remain in the ruins of their contaminated homes, or in buildings where metal exposure will continue,\u201d Dr Savabieasfahani told Al Jazeera.\n\u201cOur research in Fallujah indicated that the majority of families returned to their bombarded homes and lived there, or otherwise rebuilt on top of the contaminated rubble of their old homes. When possible, they also used building materials that were salvaged from the bombarded sites. Such common practices will contribute to the public\u2019s continuous exposure to toxic metals years after the bombardment of their area has ended.\u201d\nShe pointed out how large quantities of DU bullets, as well as other munitions, were released into the Iraqi environment.\n\u201cBetween 2002 and 2005, the US armed forces expended six billion bullets \u2013 according to the figures of the US General Accounting Office,\u201d she added.\nAccording to Dr Savabieasfahani, metal contaminants in war zones originate from bombs and bullets, as well as from other explosive devices. Metals, most importantly lead, uranium, and mercury, are used in the manufacture of munitions, and all of these contribute to birth defects, immunological disorders, and other illnesses.\n\u201cOur study in two Iraqi cities, Fallujah and Basra, focused on congenital birth defects,\u201d she said.\nHer research showed that both studies found increasing numbers of birth defects, especially neural tube defects and congenital heart defects. It also revealed public contamination with two major neurotoxic metals, lead and mercury.\n\u201cThe Iraq birth defects epidemic is, however, surfacing in the context of many more public health problems in bombarded cities,\u201d she said. \u201cChildhood leukemia, and other types of cancers, are increasing in Iraq.\u201d\nFallujah babies\nDoctors in Fallujah are continuing to witness the aforementioned steep rise in severe congenital birth defects, including children being born with two heads, children born with only one eye, multiple tumours, disfiguring facial and body deformities, and complex nervous system problems.\n| Doctors in Fallujah are registering hundreds of babies with severe birth defects, which they attribute to DU munitions and other war toxins [Dr Samira Alani/Al Jazeera] |\nToday in Fallujah, residents are reporting to Al Jazeera that many families are too scared to have children, as an alarming number of women are experiencing consecutive miscarriages and deaths with critically deformed and ill newborns.\nDr Samira Alani, a pediatric specialist at Fallujah General Hospital, has taken a personal interest in investigating an explosion of congenital abnormalities that have mushroomed in the wake of the US sieges since 2005.\n\u201cWe have all kinds of defects now, ranging from congenital heart disease to severe physical abnormalities, both in numbers you cannot imagine,\u201d Alani told Al Jazeera at her office in the hospital last year, while showing countless photos of shocking birth defects.\nAlani also co-authored a study in 2010 that showed the rate of heart defects in Fallujah to be 13 times the rate found in Europe. And, for birth defects involving the nervous system, the rate was calculated to be 33 times that found in Europe for the same number of births.\nAs of December 21, 2011, Alani, who has worked at the hospital since 1997, told Al Jazeera she had personally logged 677 cases of birth defects since October 2009. Just eight days later, when Al Jazeera visited the city on December 29, that number had already risen to 699.\nAlani showed Al Jazeera hundreds of photos of babies born with cleft pallets, elongated heads, a baby born with one eye in the centre of its face, overgrown limbs, short limbs, and malformed ears, noses and spines.\n| Multiple birth defects, many as severe as this, have become common with babies born in the aftermath of US assaults on the city [Dr Samira Alani/Al Jazeera] |\nShe told Al Jazeera of cases of \u201cthanatophoric displacia\u201d, an abnormality in bones and the rib cage that \u201crender the newborn incompatible with life\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been found by a coroner\u2019s court that cancer was caused by an exposure to depleted uranium,\u201d Busby told Al Jazeera.\n\u201cIn the last ten years, research has emerged that has made it quite clear that uranium is one of the most dangerous substances known to man, certainly in the form that it takes when used in these wars.\u201d\nIn July 2010, Busby released a study that showed a 12-fold increase in childhood cancer in Fallujah since the 2004 attacks. The report also showed the sex ratio had become skewed to 86 boys born to every 100 girls, together with a spread of diseases indicative of genetic damage \u2013 similar to, but of far greater incidence than Hiroshima.\nDr Alani has visited Japan where she met with Japanese doctors who study birth defect rates they believe related to radiation from the US nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nShe was told birth defect incidence rates there are between one and two per cent. Alani\u2019s log of cases of birth defects amounts to a rate of 14.7 per cent of all babies born in Fallujah, more than 14 times the rate in the effected areas of Japan.\nIn March 2013, Dr Alani informed Al Jazeera that the incident rates of congenital malformations remained around 14 percent.\nAs staggering as these statistics are, Dr Alani points to the same problem of under-reporting that Dr Haddad mentioned, and said that the crisis is even worse than these statistics indicate.\n|\nDr Alani\u2019s log of birth defects amounts to a rate more than 14 times the rate experienced by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. |\n\u201cWe have no system to register all of them, so we have so many cases we are missing,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I only know of 40-50 percent of the cases because so many families have their babies at home and we never know of these, and other clinics are not registering them either.\u201d\nAdditionally, Dr Alani remains the only person in Fallujah registering cases, and reported that she was still seeing the same severe defects.\n\u201cWe have so many cases of babies with multiple system defects in one baby,\u201d she explained. \u201cMultiple abnormalities in one baby. For example, we just had one baby with central nervous system problems, skeletal defects, and heart abnormalities. This is common in Fallujah today.\u201d\nDisconcertingly, Dr Alani mentioned something that Dr Savabieasfahani\u2019s research warned of.\n| Dr Samira Alani is the only person in Fallujah registering cases of newborn malformation [Dahr Jamail/Al Jazeera] |\nThe hospital where Alani does her work was constructed in the Dhubadh district of Fallujah in 2008. According to Alani, the district was bombed heavily during the November 2004 siege.\nDr Savabieasfahani explained that her research proves areas of Fallujah, as well as Basra, \u201care contaminated with lead and mercury, two highly toxic heavy metals\u201d, from US bombings in 1991 and during the 2003 invasion. \u201cExposure to metals, as well as to ionizing radiation, can lead to cancer,\u201d she added.\nShe said that, when the DU munitions explode or strike their targets, they generate \u201cfine metal-containing dust particles as well as DU-containing particles that persist in the environment. These particles can enter the food chain and enter the human body via contaminated food. Toxic particles can also become airborne with the wind and be inhaled by the public. Iraq is prone to frequent sand and dust storms. Continuous public inhalation of toxic materials can lead to cancer. Ingested or inhaled particles that emit alpha radiation can cause cancer.\u201d\nBasra and Southern Iraq\nIn Babil Province in southern Iraq, cancer rates have been escalating at alarming rates since 2003. Dr Sharif al-Alwachi, the head of the Babil Cancer Centre, blames the use of depleted uranium weapons by US forces during and following the 2003 invasion.\n\u201cThe environment could be contaminated by chemical weapons and depleted uranium from the aftermath of the war on Iraq,\u201d Dr Alwachi told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe air, soil and water are all polluted by these weapons, and as they come into contact with human beings they become poisonous. This is new to our region, and people are suffering here.\u201d\nAccording to a study published in the Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology, a professional journal based in the southwestern German city of Heidelberg, there was a sevenfold increase in the number of birth defects in Basra between 1994 and 2003.\nAccording to the Heidelberg study, the concentration of lead in the milk teeth of sick children from Basra was almost three times as high as comparable values in areas where there was no fighting.\nIn addition, never before has such a high rate of neural tube defects (\u201copen back\u201d) been recorded in babies as in Basra, and the rate continues to rise. According to the study, the number of hydrocephalus (\u201cwater on the brain\u201d) cases among new-borns is six times as high in Basra as it is in the United States.\nAbdulhaq Al-Ani, author of Uranium in Iraq, has been researching the effects of depleted uranium on Iraqis since 1991. He told Al Jazeera he personally measured radiation levels in the city of Kerbala, as well as in Basra, and his geiger counter was \u201cscreaming\u201d because \u201cthe indicator went beyond the range\u201d.\nDr Savabieasfahani pointed out that childhood leukemia rates in Basra more than doubled between 1993 and 2007.\n\u201cMultiple cancers in patients \u2013 patients with simultaneous tumours on both kidneys and in the stomach, for example \u2013 an extremely rare occurrence, have also been reported there,\u201d she said. \u201cThese observations collectively suggest an extraordinary public health emergency in Iraq. Such a crisis requires urgent multifaceted international action to prevent further damage to public health.\u201d\nInternational law and the future\nThere are clear international laws addressing the use of munitions such as Depleted Uranium.\n|\n\u201cThere are not even medical terms to describe some of these conditions because we\u2019ve never seen them until now.\u201d \u2013 Dr Samira Alani |\nArticle 35 of Protocol I, a 1977 amendment of the Geneva Conventions, prohibits any means or methods of warfare that cause superfluous injuries or unnecessary suffering. Article 35 also prohibits those nations from resorting to means of war that could inflict extensive and long-term damage on human health and the environment.\nThe observed impacts of DU in Iraq suggest that these weapons fall under Article 35 as being prohibited, by the very nature of their suspected long-lasting effects on human health and the environment.\nArticle 36 (of Protocol I) also obliges any state studying, developing, or acquiring a new weapon to hold a legal review of that weapon.\nThus far, Belgium (2007) and Costa Rica (2011) have passed domestic laws prohibiting uranium weapons within their territories. In 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that stated that \u201cthe use of DU in warfare\nruns counter to the basic rules and principles enshrined in written and customary international, humanitarian and environmental law\u201d.\nNevertheless, DNA mutations caused by DU can, of course, be passed from parent to child. Hence, DU contamination from the US-led wars against Iraq in 1990 and 2003 appear to likely continue to cause a persistent national health crisis for future generations of Iraqis.\nThe remaining traces of DU in Iraq represent a formidable long-term environmental hazard, as they will remain radioactive for more than 4.5 billion years.\nDr Savabieasfahani feels that more research and studies need to be carried out in Iraq in order to obtain the full scope of damage caused by the weapons of war used in that country since 1990.\n\u201cWe need large scale environmental testing to find out the extent of environmental contamination by metals and DU, and other weapons in Iraq,\u201d she concluded.\n\u201cThere are not even medical terms to describe some of these conditions because we\u2019ve never seen them until now,\u201d Dr Alani said. \u201cSo when I describe it, all I can do is describe the physical defects, but am unable to provide a medical term.\u201d\nDr Haddad shared his deep concern about the future of his own, and other, Iraqi children.\n\u201cI feel fear for them,\u201d he said, sadly. \u201cThey are encircled by so many problems like health issues, toxins, and we must work to spare them from disease, radiation, and chemical toxins. These are the silent killers, because you can\u2019t see them until the problem grows very large. Too many Iraqis have suffered from these, and I can\u2019t see how that suffering will not continue.\u201d\nDr Alani simply wanted people, especially those in the United States, to know of the crisis in Fallujah, and asked one thing from them.\n\u201cI ask them to ask their government not to hurt people outside of their country,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially the people of Iraq.\u201d\nFollow Dahr Jamail on Twitter: @DahrJamail"

      "text": "Twenty years ago, on Nov. 7, 2004, a coalition assault force of more than 15,000 troops, mostly Marines, launched a massive attack on the city of Fallujah, Iraq.\nOver the next seven weeks they would retake the city, capturing or killing as many as 2,000 insurgents who had controlled the stronghold since April 2004 following the killing and mutilation of four private U.S. security contractors.\nBut the coalition and Marines did not fight through long days and nights unscathed. The Second Battle of Fallujah \u2014 known as Operation Phantom Fury \u2014 was the most intense urban fighting of the Iraq War, more even than the initial surge into Baghdad during the 2003 invasion.\nThe estimated population of Fallujah in 2004 was fewer than 300,000 residents. All but 30,000 fled the city ahead of the fight. Baghdad, meanwhile, had a population of more than 5.7 million.\nIn the bloody street-by-street, house-by-house fighting, 82 U.S. troops died and another 600 were wounded. Fallujah marked the most intense urban fighting the Marine Corps had seen since the Battle of Hue during the Vietnam War.\nAnd though the November 2004 battle is considered a success, the city would fall approximately a decade later to Islamic State fighters, who held the city until 2016 when they were defeated by Iraqi-led coalition forces.\nToday, two decades after Marines entered the hornet\u2019s nest, Fallujah is regarded for its ferocity and the lessons it yields for Marines in a future urban fight. And in 2023, the Navy laid the keel for the future amphibious assault ship Fallujah, named in honor of the Marines who fought in the battle.\n\u201cFallujah has come to represent Iraq to the Marine Corps,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel who now serves as a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nPolitics, media and social media\nPublic attention and political pressure were major factors in both the first \u2014 in the spring of 2004 \u2014 and second battles of Fallujah, as calls at the time for more aggressive operations sounded from Washington.\nThat push resulted in Marines, who had only been in the Fallujah area for two weeks prior to the spring operation, being rushed into the city without proper planning, resources or training.\nMarines took the subsequent five months to refit, redistribute and coordinate before launching the second large-scale assault on the city.\nAlso modified was media coverage of the war. During the first battle the Marines did not include embedded reporters, which allowed insurgents to propagandize anything coming out of the fight to garner outside support. In the second battle of Fallujah, however, the Marines embedded as many as 60 reporters with units to highlight the atrocities being committed by insurgents.\nGetting the U.S. side of the fighting out through the media, Cancian said, helped ease pressure on politicians and allowed military leaders to conduct the operation.\nSince that time, development of new technology that favors urban defenders, the presence of social media and real-time evolution of urban combat in Gaza and Ukraine have raised the stakes for how the Marine Corps, and the U.S. military as a whole, prepares for another urban fight.\nToday\u2019s constant stream of online video, such as battlefield footage regularly posted from Ukraine and Gaza, allows for a flood of disinformation, which could again ratchet up pressure on civilian leadership.\n\u201cThe Marines were trying to move into Fallujah, a pretty bloody and destructive battle that was on TV. Political leadership blinked and told the Marine Corps to stand down,\u201d Cancian said. \u201cIf we\u2019re ever in this situation where you get these images of destruction and death day after day, that creates a backlash and we\u2019re seeing that in Gaza.\u201d\nWhile military leaders today might plan for such challenges with political leaders, Cancian is skeptical if that will even help.\n\u201cI say that because politics is a very short term, immediate game,\u201d Cancian said.\nHe\u2019s not alone in his thinking.\nRetired Army Maj. John Spencer, a leading expert on urban warfare who fought in battles in Iraq in 2003 and the Siege of Sadr City in 2008, co-authored a case study of the battle for the Modern War Institute. The study captures the demands of the fight, which still might differ from what an urban, peer adversary fight would look like today.\nA single Marine tank company in Fallujah, for example, fired 1,600 main gun rounds, 121,000 7.62mm machine gun rounds and nearly 50,000 .50-caliber machine gun rounds. Most of their targets were within 200 yards.\nOne Marine weapons company reported that, on a daily basis, each of its six assault teams used an average of six satchel charges, three cases of Bangalore torpedoes and 10 shoulder-launched weapons.\nOver the course of the battle, coalition forces fired more than 4,000 artillery rounds, dropped 318 aerial bombs and fired 391 rockets to support ground troops in the city.\nThose munitions figures align with Canadian Army doctrine, which estimates urban operations consume four times the amount of ammunition, according to the case study. The same doctrine shows that such fighting can create three to six times the number of casualties and require nearly three times the amount of water and rations per soldier than operations in other terrain.\nLance Cpl. Chris Lowe was one of the Marines in Fallujah and saw firsthand the effects of those rounds, bombs and rockets.\nLowe, then 20 years old, served as a warehouse clerk but was assigned to a security detail with the 5th Marine Regiment\u2019s bomb technicians. He manned machine guns and automatic grenade launchers as bomb techs blasted Improvised Explosive Devices and other hazards all over the city\u2019s cluttered battlefield.\n\u201cYou\u2019re bound to come across carnage, particularly in our line of work \u2014 it happens,\u201d he told Marine Corps Times.\nThe post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury that Lowe experienced surfaced after the fight, he said, mostly when he got home.\nHe struggled over the ensuing years, eventually leaving the Marine Corps in 2016. For more than 14 years Lowe has been working with a case manager at the Semper Fi and America\u2019s Fund, which has provided him neurological fitness training and financial assistance.\nDespite his post-war struggles, when Lowe looks back on that harrowing experience, he wants people to know how much the battle meant to those who fought it.\n\u201cThe time spent there, the blood, sweat and tears and even laughter \u2014 because there were a lot of really good times, good camaraderie \u2014 those memories are going to last forever,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best I can do is live for those who cannot come back.\u201d\nPreparing for the next Fallujah\nBoth Spencer and Cancian told Marine Corps Times that they don\u2019t see much preparation in the Marine Corps or the Army when it comes to facing another Fallujah.\n\u201cThere was a massive battle in the hospital in the first days,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cThe enemy [was set up] in a hospital. But I don\u2019t think you could repeat Fallujah II today, based on social media.\u201d\nSince the 2004 battle, both commercial and military technology have advanced. Everything from target-recognition software to commercial drones are now accessible to any nation and non-state actors.\nBut if a future urban fight arises, the Marines will be without one critical tool \u2014 tanks. Former Commandant Gen. David Berger discarded tanks from the Marine Corps inventory in 2021.\nIn the Modern War Institute case study, authors noted that, in the early days of fighting, an armor-backed task force maneuvered through the city rapidly while dismounted Marines stalled following a breach failure.\nCancian argued that, prior to the Marine Corps Force Design changes, which eliminated tanks, the service should have at least preserved an enhanced battalion of six armor companies.\nBerger said at the time that if the Marines need armor in the future, the Army can be relied upon.\nBut both Cancian and Spencer doubt that pairing the two will be that easy.\nFor one, Spencer said, integrating infantry and armor requires training. Without regular work between Marine infantry units and Army tankers, there\u2019s not much practice.\nSpencer noted that time also plays a factor.\nRussia\u2019s early struggles in urban fighting in Ukraine came in part from the brief buildup to the invasion, he said. In Gaza, Hamas fighters had decades to lay their defenses.\n\u201cThe lesson is, if you give them the time to prepare it\u2019s going to be a lot harder to take the city or do it without destruction,\u201d Spencer said.\nIt\u2019s unlikely the U.S. will have a first go at an urban battle against an adversary such as Russia or China and be able to reset for five months before launching another operation, he said.\nSpencer has long advocated, as a partial solution, for both the Army and Marine Corps to create permanent urban training centers, expert staff, training manuals and better gear.\nThat wide-reaching resolution may not be as feasible with current military priorities and spending, however. Still, adding urban combat planning into military education and pushing leaders to dedicate a portion of their regular training to that environment are good first steps, he said.\nBut in 2020, the Marines canceled what was supposed to be a five-year-long experiment on urban technology and tactics in favor of developing new formations for its anticipated naval role in the Pacific.\n\u201cThe Marine Corps has essentially moved on strategically from an urban fight and counterinsurgency,\u201d Cancian said.\nTodd South has written about crime, courts, government and the military for multiple publications since 2004 and was named a 2014 Pulitzer finalist for a co-written project on witness intimidation. Todd is a Marine veteran of the Iraq War."

      "text": "The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) expresses its deep concern over the shutdown of the last remaining cancer treatment center in the Gaza Strip, particularly after the European Gaza Hospital has gone out of service following a series of airstrikes that targeted the hospital and its proximity on 13 May 2025. With this heinous crime, Israel has extinguished the last glimmer of hope for Gaza\u2019s cancer patients to access treatment within the Gaza Strip, sentencing them to a slow death. PCHR considers the continued international community\u2019s silence towards these compounded crimes and failure to take decisive action to hold the perpetrators accountable a humanitarian and moral vacuum and even amount to complicity in these crimes. PCHR emphasizes that cancer patients in the Gaza Strip are in dire need of urgent and immediate intervention as they are at imminent risk of death at the world\u2019s full view.\nAccording to a statement issued by the Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday, 29 May 2025, intravenous chemotherapy services and medical follow-up for cancer patients have completely ceased in the Gaza Strip, particularly after the targeting of the Gaza European Hospital and the evacuation of its patients. This has further exacerbated the already catastrophic conditions faced by cancer patients, particularly as medical teams were unable to evacuate the available medicines, pharmaceutical supplies, and medical devices necessary for cancer patients from the hospital, and that cannot be found or replaced in any other hospital within the Gaza Strip.1\nPCHR emphasizes that forcing the remaining cancer treatment centers in the Gaza Strip out of service is part of a systematic policy pursued by Israel since the onset of its ongoing crime of genocide on 07 October 2023. Before the targeting of the Gaza European Hospital, the IOF destroyed the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital; the only governmental facility specialized in treating adult tumors, and the Cancer Treatment Department at al-Rantisi Pediatric Hospital, after turning them into military barracks for long periods. Following the destruction and closure of these facilities, the temporary Friendship Field Hospital was established with support from international health organizations as the last resort for thousands of patients. However, it has also gone out of service following recent Israeli attacks, leaving patients alone to face a slow death without medicines, equipment, or even hope for treatment inside the Gaza Strip.\nThis comes amid restricted and complex travel mechanisms imposed by the IOF on cancer patients, as only 1,100 out of 12,500 cancer patients in the Gaza Strip have been allowed to travel for treatment; 623 of whom were permitted to leave after the IOF seized control of Rafah Crossing in May 2024. 2 These figures lay bare the complex and calculated bureaucratic procedures enforced by the Israeli authorities, becoming a systematic policy in their hands and alarming slow death sentence for patients forced to wait while their lives hang in the balance. PCHR\u2019s statistics indicate that 615 cancer patients died between October 2023 and April 2025, while approximately 2,700 others in advanced stages of the disease await treatment with no hope or treatment options within the Gaza Strip under an ongoing closure of Gaza\u2019s crossings, and the disruption of emergency medical evacuation mechanisms. With the deliberate destruction of hospitals and the shutdown of all cancer treatment centers, Israel has managed to deprive more than 90% of cancer patients of their right to treatment within the Gaza Strip after systematically denying them access to treatment abroad, in a compounded violation that jeopardizes their right to life and embodies elements of a systematic crime of genocide.\nThese crimes constitute a blatant violation of the principles of international humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention, which obliges the protection of the wounded and sick and prohibits the use of deprivation of healthcare as a method of warfare. Additionally, the collective punishment policy imposed on the population of the Gaza Strip, which has led to the collapse of the healthcare system and denied patients access to treatment, constitutes a grave breach of Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Furthermore, the IOF\u2019s acts, including the deliberate infliction of physical and psychological harm, destruction of facilities and denial of medicine and travel for treatment, clearly fall under the third act described in Article II of the Genocide Convention: \u2018Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u2019 Denying access to treatment, whether inside the Gaza Strip or abroad, can only be seen as part of a broader policy of collective punishment and ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the IOF against the Gaza Strip\u2019s population.\nIn light of the above, PCHR holds Israel fully responsible for the deaths of hundreds of cancer patients and for deliberately obliterating any opportunities of treatment for thousands more by destroying their treatment centers and depriving them of travel. Such acts fall under the crime of genocide ongoing in the Gaza Strip. PCHR calls on the international community, particularly the States Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, to take immediate and urgent action to halt these crimes, facilitate the reopening of humanitarian corridors, and guarantee the freedom of movement for patients seeking treatment outside the Gaza Strip. PCHR also urges international health organizations, foremost of whom the World Health Organization (WHO), to intervene urgently and provide direct and effective support to rehabilitate the healthcare system in the Gaza Strip, including the provision of necessary medicines and treatment supplies for cancer patients, the reopening of specialized medical centers, and ensuring the availability of qualified medical teams capable of handling complex cases, as part of the ethical and humanitarian commitment to guarantee the right to health for populations under occupation.\n[\u2026] Hospital erbracht, aber nicht ausreichend, um der gesamten kranken Bev\u00f6lkerung zu dienen.

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) provides a detailed account of the grave concerns regarding the operational capacity of hospitals between 7 October 2023 and 30 June 2024 (1). As of 30 June 2024, 22 of the 36 hospitals across Gaza were reported as non-functional, and by January 2025, only 18 remained partially functional. Despite the continuous, repeated attacks on healthcare in a highly restrictive environment, the health system remains on life support, as a direct result of the combined efforts of WHO, Palestinian Ministry of Health, emergency medical teams, the Health Cluster and other partners whose aim is to provide access to life-saving care.\nPrior to the latest escalation, Gaza Strip had endured longstanding humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by protracted blockade since 2007, with approximately 80% of the population dependent on humanitarian aid (2). The health system operated under chronic shortages of medicines, medical supplies, electricity, and skilled personnel. Health facilities struggled to meet the needs of the population, leaving many patients with chronic diseases or severe injuries (3). Critical services such as maternal and child health care were strained (4). Despite these challenges, Gaza had positive health indicators: vaccination coverage for registered refugee children was close to 100% for over a decade, and in 2019, the reported maternal mortality rate (MMR) was 19.9 per 100 000 live births and the infant mortality rate (IMR) was 10.8 per 1000 livebirths\u2014both below the Sustainable Development Goals targets (5).\nHealthcare under fire\nA study published by The Lancet estimates that between 7 October 2023 and 30 June 2024, a total of 64 260 people died due to traumatic injury in Gaza, representing 2.9% of the pre-conflict population and equivalent to 1 in every 35 inhabitants (6). This mortality rate is 41% higher than the estimate provided by the Palestinian Ministry of Health (MoH) (37 877 deaths) for the same period. The study also infers that, while the official MoH estimate by 6 October 2024 was 41 909 deaths, if the 41% under-reporting rate persisted from July to October 2025, the actual death toll may now have exceeded 70 000. This figure does not account for deaths caused by non-traumatic injuries or indirect mortality due to disrupted healthcare, inadequate access to essential services, or the broader humanitarian impact of the conflict, which would further increase the total death toll. Between 1 November 2023 and 30 April 2024, nearly 70% of the verified fatalities in Gaza were women and children (7).\nTrauma care delivery has been critically impaired and rehabilitation services have been severely limited. Health workers lack the resources to treat surgical cases, leading to higher rates of disability and death. Life-saving amputation has been prioritized over limb salvage, patients have been prematurely discharged due to bed shortages, and wound infections have been prevalent. WHO estimates that by September 2024, more than 24 000 people would have had major life-changing injuries (8).\nAs of 20 January 2025, WHO had verified 668 attacks on healthcare facilities in Gaza, resulting in 886 fatalities and 1355 injuries. Of these, 438 incidents impacted health facilities and 151 impacted medical transportation. The evacuation orders have severely impacted healthcare, overwhelming facilities outside the evacuation zones with mass casualties and displaced persons.\nForced displacement, overcrowding, limited access to water and sanitation due to the destruction of water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure has worsened the spread of infectious diseases (10\u201313). A total of 2006 cases of bloody diarrhoea were reported in June 2024 (9). Surveillance capacities and disease control measures remain severely constrained, resulting in the inability to timely manage the spread of diseases.\nThe health of about 350 000 people with chronic diseases continues to deteriorate and access to care outside Gaza has been impossible because of the cessation of referral permits since October 2023 (14).\nAbout 485 000 people with mental health disorders, of which an estimated 20 000 are in need of specialized mental health services, continue to experience disruptions to their treatment (15). High-risk pregnancies have doubled due to limited access to emergency obstetric care (16), and 690 000 menstruating women and girls have faced challenges due to the shortage of sanitary products and clean water (17).\nIn December 2023, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Famine Review Committee warned of imminent famine in northern Gaza, a risk already highlighted in March and June 2024 (18). By September 2024, Gaza health authorities had reported 38 malnutrition-related deaths, and by the end of December 2024, the Nutrition Cluster had reported the enrolment into treatment of over 40 000 children with global acute malnutrition, including hospitalization of 456 children severely malnourished with complications.\nRevive and rebuild the health system\nThe current crisis will have long-term effects on the lives and wellbeing of the people of Gaza, including the future generations, because the health challenges are immense and seemingly insurmountable. Addressing the challenges requires conditions that ensure systematic, unrestricted and sustained access to the whole of Gaza, with unhindered inflow of aid.\nWith 84% of health facilities reportedly damaged or destroyed, equivalent of about US$ 554 million damage to the health sector, massive scale-up of funding is urgently required to address the immediate health needs and restore the heath system, including the workforce, supply chain and health infrastructure (19).\nDuring the January 2025 ceasefire, WHO and partners successfully delivered medical supplies, including haemodialysis equipment critical for patients with severe kidney conditions. However, certain restrictions and last-minute movement cancellations need to be lifted, such as the restriction on flatbed-only trucks, which impacts the transportation of temperature-controlled drugs. Global procurement for the provision of essential health care services need to be scaled up. This is very important as lack of equipment (47%) and supplies (34%) and insecurity have been identified as the leading causes of the inability of health facilities to provide services across Gaza (20).\nEarly recovery efforts should prioritize restoring essential services while fostering a resilient and sustainable health system. They should support long-term peace and development in line with the humanitarian-development-peace nexus framework. Adherence to international humanitarian law and human rights is essential, alongside the integration of locally-driven, conflict-sensitive approaches. The ceasefire presents a unique opportunity to restore and strengthen Gaza\u2019s health system through a phased approach that starts with immediate humanitarian aid and progresses toward long-term sustainability and resilience.\nEconomic recovery is fundamental to achieving a sustainable health system. A robust economy will enable investment in public health and social welfare and reduce dependence on external aid. The international community must act decisively to support economic recovery in Gaza to ensure that the health system\u2014and the people\u2014can build a healthier and more stable future.\nAs Gaza embarks on recovery, healthcare must remain at the centre of rebuilding efforts, because \u201cthere cannot be health without peace and there cannot be peace without health\u201d, according to Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors acknowledge Giulia Olivieri for her contributions.\nReferences\n- OHCHR, Thematic report - Attacks on hospitals during the escalation of hostilities in Gaza (7 October 2023 - 30 June 2024).
