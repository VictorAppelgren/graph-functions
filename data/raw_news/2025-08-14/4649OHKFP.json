  "description": "Republican Wisconsin Rep. Tom Tiffany is the clear favorite among likely Republican primary voters for the state's open gubernatorial seat, a new poll shows.",
  "content": "Republican Wisconsin Rep. Tom Tiffany is the clear favorite among likely Republican primary voters in the state\u2019s open 2026 gubernatorial race, according to recent polling.\n\nTiffany holds a commanding lead over a hypothetical primary field with 40% of the vote, followed by Washington County executive Josh Schoemann at 13% and former Navy Seal and manufacturing executive Bill Berrien at 10%. Tiffany is well-positioned to secure the Republican nomination if he enters the race and would likely cruise to the general election with President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement, according to a polling memo conducted by Republican firm Fabrizio, Lee & Associates and exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: GOP Rep Goes After Loophole Allowing Chinese To Abuse Birthright Citizenship In Northern Mariana Island)\n\n\u201cTom Tiffany is in a solid position and is the clear front-runner in the Republican Primary for Wisconsin Governor,\u201d the polling memo states. \u201cAn endorsement from President Trump and educating voters about Tiffany and his record would propel his lead even further, with either option essentially sealing the deal for the primary nomination.\u201d\n\nTiffany, a three-term lawmaker and member of the conservative Republican Study Committee has said he will make a decision to run for governor by the end of September. Schoemann and Berrien have already declared for the race.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to take back the governor\u2019s mansion in the key battleground state following two terms of Democratic rule under Governor Tony Evers. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin last November, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris by roughly 30,000 votes. Evers announced in July that he would not run for a third term.\n\nThe president has yet to publicly back a candidate in the Republican primary. The survey found that a Trump endorsement would grow Tiffany\u2019s edge over the primary field to 60%, leaving his two declared opponents with less than 10% of the vote respectively.\n\nInforming voters about Tiffany\u2019s record in Congress further expanded his lead over the other Republican candidates in the race, according to the polling memo. Voters were 92% more likely to vote for the three-term lawmaker after hearing about his \u201csolid border record.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are also likely to have a crowded primary field vying for the open seat. Democratic Lieutenant Governor Sara Rodriguez is the only well-known candidate in the race thus far, entering the race less than 24 hours after Evers\u2019 announced his retirement.\n\nThe multimodal survey of 600 likely Wisconsin Republican primary voters was conducted between July 28 and 31. Tiffany holds a commanding lead well outside the poll\u2019s margin of error of plus or minus 4%. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said they were undecided about their preferred candidate.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "As he teases a run for governor, Tom Tiffany wades into campaigning at the Wisconsin State Fair\n- Rep. Tom Tiffany is likely to announce a run for Wisconsin governor in the next 30 to 60 days.\n- Tiffany visited the Wisconsin State Fair, engaging with conservative groups like Moms for Liberty, and criticized Gov. Tony Evers on education and transgender issues.\n- He expressed his opposition to transgender girls participating in girls' sports, aligning with other Republican candidates.\nWEST ALLIS \u2013 While he didn\u2019t walk around the Wisconsin State Fair enthusiastically shaking hands with voters like an official candidate for governor, Republican U.S Rep. Tom Tiffany worked conservative groups' booths to make himself known.\nHis appearance is the latest indication Tiffany plans to run for governor, though he has pushed back his timeline for announcing a possible campaign. Tiffany previously said he'd make his decision after July but now plans to announce his decision in the next 30 to 60 days.\nIn an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel at the fairgrounds on Aug. 4, Tiffany said he doubted he\u2019d decide before Labor Day.\n\u201cThe decision is going to be made by the end of September. I\u2019m not going to drag this out beyond then,\u201d he said.\nAn ongoing straw poll conducted at the Milwaukee County Republican Party booth had Tiffany running in fourth place, with former U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde leading the pack after about 400 votes cast.\nTiffany's day at the fair included a stop at the Moms for Liberty booth, a parental rights group that has gained influence within the Republican Party and launched candidates for school board seats in Wisconsin.\nTiffany criticized Democratic Gov. Tony Evers for lowering academic standards, a reference to state Superintendent Jill Underly changing state test score benchmarks. Evers has called the changes a \u201cmistake\u201d but vetoed a bill to reverse them.\nMoms for Liberty representatives also questioned Tiffany about transgender students participating in youth sports.\n\u201cAs a girl dad, that hits home. All three of my daughters competed in interscholastic sports. They shouldn\u2019t have to compete against guys,\u201d Tiffany said.\nEvers has used his veto several times to block Republican-authored bills that would have banned transgender youth from participating in girls' sports or using girls' locker rooms.\nThose bills are under consideration again in the state Capitol but have not yet reached Evers' desk.\nIn February, the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association changed its policies, not because of state legislation but in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump.\nThe WIAA policy now says students whose sex is assigned male at birth may practice but not compete. The organization has previously said they do not track the number of transgender athletes in Wisconsin and had not received complaints about a specific athlete.\nAt the state level, the bills could see a different fate depending on which Republican or Democrat replaces Evers, who is not running for reelection in 2026. Some national Democrats have shifted their position on transgender rights, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\nThe two declared Republican candidates for governor have also focused on transgender youth. Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann's campaign website says he will \"end woke overreach in education and restore common sense.\"\nAnd Navy SEAL veteran and manufacturing CEO Bill Berrien's campaign launch video, he says: \"Take it from a dad and a coach, I will keep boys out of our daughters' sports and locker rooms.\"\nIn a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Abigail Swetz, Executive Director of Fair Wisconsin, said Wisconsin voters \u201cshould be ready to reject any ploy for power on the backs of trans children.\u201d\n\u201cThe use of anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and partnerships with extremist organizations is just one more example of politicians using children as political pawns in a game of \u2018who can use disinformation to win an election,\u2019 and it is disheartening that candidates for elected office are preying on such vulnerable Wisconsinites,\u201d Swetz said. \u201cOur trans youth are vital members of our communities; as children, they deserve our love and support.\u201d\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center classified Moms for Liberty as an anti-government extremist organization in 2023. In a video filmed for the group at the booth, Tiffany told members, \u201cIf somebody yells at you, like the Southern Poverty Law Center, just ignore them or tell them your story.\u201d\nTiffany told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the group\u2019s focus on a loss of educational attainment during the pandemic also resonates with Wisconsin parents.\n\u201cThere\u2019s kind of these fundamental things that society is throwing at parents, saying \u2018We\u2019re going to change the norm. We\u2019re going to change how society operates.\u2019 And people are pushing back, saying no, this is unacceptable,\u201d he said.\nRepublicans also zeroed in on transgender rights issues in 2024 races for U.S. Senate and state legislative seats, painting Democrats as extreme and out of touch with voters. The Marquette University Law School poll asked Wisconsin voters about the issue just once, in 2022.\nIn that survey, 62% said transgender athletes should only be allowed to play on teams that match their sex at birth, and 22% said they should be able to play on teams that match their gender identity. Another 14% didn't know."

Tony Evers announced Thursday he will not seek reelection to a third term in 2026.\nEvers\u2019 retirement sets the state up for its first wide-open gubernatorial race since 2010 and second since 1982. The governor, 73, said he wants to spend more time with his family adding that he thinks he would win a third term if he had decided to run again, in his announcement shared via a video he posted to X on Thursday afternoon.

      "text": "Republican Wisconsin Rep. Tom Tiffany asked Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) Kristi Noem to end a loophole that allows Chinese nationals to visit the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), a US territory, without a visa, in a letter exclusively shared with the Daily Caller.\nSpecifically, Tiffany requested that Noem take steps to end the January 2024 rule called the \u201cGuam-Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Visa Waiver Program Automation and Electronic Travel Authorization; Creation of CNMI Economic Vitality & Security Travel Authorization Program (EVS-TAP).\u201d\nThe Biden-era rule continues an Obama program which allowed \u201c\u2018categorical\u2019 parole\u201d to Chinese nationals to travel to CNMI, according to Tiffany.\nAs a result of the program, he wrote, Chinese citizens \u201cwere able to sidestep the legal requirement that they first obtain a tourist visa before entering the CNMI.\u201d\nThe loophole, Tiffany continued, has led to a \u201ctroubling rise in \u2018birth tourism.'\u201d\nIn the letter, the representative pointed out that births to foreign visitors in CNMI jumped from under 10 in 2009 to nearly 600 in 2018.\nThe phenomenon of foreign nationals giving birth in the islands\u2019 capital city of Saipan became so common \u201cthat such births exceeded the number of births to legal U.S. residents there in recent years,\u201d Tiffany wrote.\nThe birth tourism phenomenon has become a cottage industry. It\u2019s given rise to a criminal human trafficking network, Tiffany wrote in the letter. The DOJ prosecuted U.S./Taiwanese dual citizen Richard Peng from 2016 to 2017 after his involvement in an underground birth tourism network which Chinese women paid thousands of dollars to for packages offering to let them give birth on US soil. Peng pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a six-month prison term. He also received one year of supervised release and a $2,000 fine.\nThe loophole also allows children of foreign nationals who become citizens to petition for their parents to then secure green cards, according to Tiffany.\nIn addition to the emboldening of crime syndicates, the congressman also noted that the loophole instituted a national security threat. (RELATED: Trump Administration Plans To Take Birthright Citizenship Fight All The Way To SCOTUS)\n\u201cSet aside the birthright citizenship part of it, it\u2019s allowing people to gain citizenship that are coming from communist China,\u201d Tiffany told the Daily Caller.\nHe pointed to current CIA head John Ratcliffe\u2018s 2020 statements in which he called Communist China \u201ca greater national security threat to the U.S. than any other nation.\u201d\n\u201cIn short, nationals of the PRC should be required to meet the same standard to visit the CNMI that they must meet to visit any other part of the United States,\u201d Tiffany\u2019s letter concluded.\n2025.02.12 dhs cnmi ltr final[86] (2) by robert on Scribd\nPresident Trump issued an executive order to end birthright citizenship on his first day in office. However, a judge swiftly blocked the order, calling it \u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d The order\u2019s language also left a potential loophole for U.S. women serving as surrogates for the children of foreigners, according to a report from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\nRepublican Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs lauded Trump\u2019s order, telling the Caller it was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d However, the congressman also rang the alarm on the CNMI loophole.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Northern Mariana is particularly vexing because it is not well known and abused widely,\u201d he told the Caller.\nHe also said that CNMI is not the only place that Chinese citizens are targeting for \u201cmaternity tourism.\u201d"
