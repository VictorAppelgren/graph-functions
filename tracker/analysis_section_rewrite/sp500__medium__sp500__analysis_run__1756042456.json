      "feedback": "The draft is directionally sound for a 3–6 month horizon and uses solid source anchors, but it needs a tighter, testable structure and explicit data-driven triggers/invalidation. Edit to: 1) convert into a formal scenario map with clearly labeled 0–3 month and 3–6 month windows, specifying concrete catalysts (e.g., IPO activity re-accelerating toward the 2025 pace of 95 deals vs. 73 in 2024; small-cap earnings momentum turning positive; rate/risk premia stabilizing toward pre‑AI regime) and explicit path-dependency (private capital flow back to public markets as a prerequisite for small‑cap re-rating). Anchor these with exact numbers from sources (Q7VVGNSQE, 95 IPOs in 2025; Russell 2000 valuation vs S&P 500 being the cheapest since 2008; MAA yield 4.3%, XOM 3.7%, TXN 2.7%, AXP 3.5–3.5% range cited in YX2J8NHZ1). 2) sharpen the transmission channels: tie the small-cap tilt to value/quality/low-volatility tilts (use IUSV and XLV ETF factor readings from 4661GWFP7 and 2YP1X9B4T to illustrate hedges and ballast), and quantify the expected impact on flows and multiples rather than qualitative statements; for example, cite IUSV as large-cap low-volatility with Services as largest sector and Software & Programming as top industry; XLV as a large-cap quality tilt with Biotechnology & Drugs leading. 3) strengthen the Disney micro-case into a coherent demand/cost framework and map it to sector/stock implications (per sources U3ZK13ZQI), but avoid overinterpreting a single perk shift as a systemic driver; 4) specify base case, 1–2 alts, and concrete invalidation triggers (e.g., if IPO activity stalls below the 2025 pace for a sustained period; if Russell 2000 relative performance fails to improve as earnings signals deteriorate; if AI leadership resumes and large-cap multiples re‑inflate, suppressing small-cap upside); 5) tighten the alarm/balance section with explicit watch-list signals (Russell 2000 price action, IPO counts, small-cap earnings revisions, quality/low‑volatility and dividend yields relative performance) and assign a confidence level anchored to converging fundamentals; 6) ensure every analytical claim is tied to one of the five IDs (U3ZK13ZQI, YX2J8NHZ1, Q7VVGNSQE, 4661GWFP7, 2YP1X9B4T) and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., the quiet consensus on small-cap under different lenses—val vs. earnings quality—via a blended scenario disclosure). This will produce a cleaner 3–6 month plan with explicit timings, clear catalysts/invalidation points, quantified inputs, and rigorous sourcing.",
