  "content": "President Trump on Saturday split from Ukraine and key European allies after his summit with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, backing Mr. Putin\u2019s plan for a sweeping peace agreement based on Ukraine ceding territory it controls to Russia, instead of the urgent cease-fire Mr. Trump had said he wanted before the meeting. Skipping cease-fire discussions would give Russia an advantage in the talks, which are expected to continue on Monday when President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine visits Mr. Trump at the White House. It breaks from a strategy Mr. Trump and European allies, as well as Mr. Zelensky, had agreed to before the U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska. Mr. Trump told European leaders that he believed a rapid peace deal could be negotiated if Mr. Zelensky agreed to give up the rest of the Donbas region to Russia, even those areas not occupied by Russian troops, according to two senior European officials briefed on the call. In return, Mr. Putin offered a cease-fire in the rest of Ukraine at current battle lines and a written promise not to attack Ukraine or any European country again, the senior officials said. He has broken similar promises before. Mr. Trump had threatened stark economic penalties if Mr. Putin left the meeting without a deal to end the war, but he has suspended those threats in the wake of the summit. The American president\u2019s moves got a chilly reception in Europe, where leaders have time and again seen Mr. Trump reverse positions on Ukraine after speaking with Mr. Putin. Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social early on Saturday that he had spoken by phone to Mr. Zelensky and European leaders after his meeting with Mr. Putin. He claimed \u201cit was determined by all\u201d that it was better to go directly to negotiating a peace agreement without first implementing a cease-fire. European leaders, publicly and privately, made clear that was not the case. They issued a statement that did not echo Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that peace talks were preferable to a cease-fire. Britain, France, Germany and others threatened to increase economic penalties on Russia \u201cas long as the killing in Ukraine continues.\u201d Mr. Zelensky, who was left out of the Alaska summit, said in a statement that he and Mr. Trump would on Monday \u201cdiscuss all of the details regarding ending the killing and the war.\u201d Here\u2019s what else to know:\n\u2022 None Zelensky\u2019s challenge: Ukraine was left scrambling to piece together what Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin had discussed and striving to avoid being sidelined. Mr. Zelensky is heading to Washington on Monday. An official briefed on his call with Mr. Trump said Kyiv does not understand why the American president suddenly dropped the demand that a cease-fire precede negotiations.

They neither endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s changed stance on how to achieve peace nor openly contradicted it.

Discarding the prospect of a cease-fire allows Russia to press that advantage further. Read more \u203a\n\nZelensky will meet Trump Monday in Washington to discuss \u2018all the details.\u2019 President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in Rome last month. After the meeting in Anchorage on Friday, Mr. Zelensky spoke with President Trump on the phone, and made plans to travel to Washington this week. After President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ended inconclusive peace talks in Alaska, Ukraine was left in a position it knows all too well. It was scrambling to piece together what the two leaders had actually discussed, deciphering what they may have agreed on and striving to avoid being sidelined in peace talks. A call a few hours later from Mr. Trump filled in some of the gaps. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said the phone discussion, which included European leaders, had been \u201clong and substantive\u201d and covered \u201cthe main points\u201d of the American leader\u2019s talks with Mr. Putin. Mr. Zelensky added that he would visit Mr. Trump in Washington on Monday \u201cto discuss all of the details regarding ending the killing and the war.\u201d But even as Mr. Zelensky\u2019s statement suggested a potential path toward a peace deal after months of largely fruitless negotiations, a public statement by Mr. Trump later on Saturday morning raised questions about whether such an opening would be too heavily tilted toward Russia for Ukraine to accept. Mr. Trump called on social media for a direct peace agreement without securing a cease-fire first, claiming that Mr. Zelensky and European leaders had agreed on the point. His statement was a stark shift from the \u201cprinciples\u201d agreed upon earlier in the week by Mr. Trump, Mr. Zelensky and his European allies, which called for refusing to discuss peace terms until a cease-fire was in place. Russia has long pushed for a direct peace deal that would address a broad range of issues and impose onerous demands on Ukraine, including territorial concessions. Avoiding a cease-fire would allow Russia to continue pressing its advantage on the battlefield in the meantime. An official briefed on the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky said the Ukrainian leader\u2019s trip to Washington would aim to seek clarity from Mr. Trump. Kyiv does not understand why the American president suddenly dropped the demand that a cease-fire precede negotiations. In a statement, Mr. Zelensky seemed to tread carefully, trying not to openly contradict Mr. Trump. \u201cWe need to achieve a real peace that will be lasting, not just another pause between Russian invasions,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. But he added that \u201cthe killings must stop as soon as possible, and the fire must cease both on the battlefield and in the air, as well as against our port infrastructure,\u201d suggesting that he was still prioritizing a cease-fire. Ukrainian soldiers in the Donetsk region in June. The Donbas, which is made up of the Donestk and Luhansk regions, is at the center of territorial disputes between Ukraine and Russia. In statements of their own, European leaders made no mention of having agreed to abandon their demand for a cease-fire. At the same time, the fact that the statements did not include a demand for a cease-fire, as in previous remarks, suggests at the very least an attempt not to antagonize Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump\u2019s move to aim for a direct peace deal could bring to failure a week of frantic diplomacy in which Kyiv, with European support, had lobbied the American administration to insist that a cease-fire should come first and that Ukraine should not be undercut in the negotiations. Mr. Trump\u2019s social media post caused a feeling of whiplash among some Ukrainians, who quickly reversed their early assessments of the Alaska summit. Oleksandr Merezhko, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the Ukrainian Parliament, had initially expressed some relief, saying that \u201cthe situation could have been worse\u201d if Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin had struck a deal behind Ukraine\u2019s back. He said that a scenario in which \u201cTrump and Putin started together to pressure Ukraine into surrender\u201d could not have been ruled out given Mr. Trump\u2019s history of deference to Mr. Putin. But after Mr. Trump\u2019s post on Truth Social, Mr. Merezhko changed his view. \u201cIn fact, Putin and Trump are starting to force us into surrender,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump also proposed security guarantees for Ukraine inspired by the collective defense agreement between NATO member countries, which states that any attack on a member is an attack against all, according to Giorgia Meloni, Italy\u2019s prime minister. Under such guarantees, Ukraine\u2019s NATO allies would be \u201cready to take action\u201d if Russia attacked again. But Mr. Merezhko and other Ukrainian allies said such a formulation was too vague. \u201cWhich countries will agree to consider an attack against Ukraine as an attack against themselves?\u201d Mr. Merezhko asked. \u201cI\u2019d like to believe that we will find such countries, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage on Friday. Mr. Trump, in an interview with Fox News after the meeting with Mr. Putin, also addressed the idea of territorial swaps, saying they were among the points \u201cthat we largely have agreed on.\u201d Mr. Trump had said several times over the past week that territorial concessions would be part of a peace agreement, drawing pushback from Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Zelensky, however, has not entirely ruled out possible land swaps, telling reporters this week that this is \u201ca very complex issue that cannot be separated from security guarantees for Ukraine.\u201d Mr. Merezhko, who like many Ukrainian officials was left on tenterhooks by the Alaska meeting, watched the post-meeting news conference live from Kyiv at around 2 a.m. local time. As both Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin offered only vague statements, Mr. Merezhko said it had become clear that no concrete deal had been reached. He noted that Mr. Putin had again said that any end to the fighting must address the \u201croot causes\u201d of the war, which is Kremlin parlance for a range of issues that include the existence of Ukraine as a fully independent and sovereign nation aligned with the West. \u201cI think it\u2019s a failure because Putin was again talking about security concerns and used his usual rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Merezhko said as the news conference came to an end. \u201cI don\u2019t see any changes.\u201d Vadym Prystaiko, a former foreign affairs minister, said in a phone interview that the summit\u2019s brief duration \u2014 it lasted just a few hours and broke up ahead of schedule \u2014 indicated limited progress toward peace. He recalled that during cease-fire negotiations in the first Ukraine-Russia war, which started in 2014, he spent 16 hours in a room with Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky\u2019s predecessor, Petro Poroshenko. The cease-fire that was eventually agreed upon did not last, and fighting soon resumed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t manage to sit enough hours to actually go through all the stuff that is needed to reach a deal,\u201d Mr. Prystaiko said of Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. In Kyiv, some emerged Saturday morning from a sleepless night following the news with the sense that the war was likely to continue unabated. After the Alaska summit wrapped up, the Ukrainian Air Force said that Russia had continued its assault on Ukraine, launching 85 drones and one ballistic missile overnight. These figures could not be independently verified. The aftermath of a Russian strike in Bilozerske, Donetsk region on Tuesday. Ukraine has demanded that a cease-fire precede a wider peace settlement, but Russia has refused to halt its attacks. Tetiana Chamlai, a 66-year-old retiree in Kyiv, said the situation with the war would change only if Ukraine was given more military support, to push Russian forces back enough to force Moscow to the negotiating table. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way everything will stop,\u201d she said. \u201cI personally do not see any other way out.\u201d But Vice President JD Vance made clear this past week that the United States was \u201cdone\u201d funding Ukraine\u2019s defense against the Russian invasion. The Trump administration, however, is fine with Ukraine buying American weapons from U.S. companies, and Mr. Zelensky announced this week that Kyiv had secured $1.5 billion in European funding to purchase American arms. How long the Ukrainian Army can hold against relentless Russian assaults remains uncertain. Moscow\u2019s forces recently broke through a section of the Ukrainian defenses in the eastern Donbas region, and although their advance has been halted, the swift infiltration has underscored the strain on Ukraine\u2019s stretched lines. Balazs Jarabik, a former European Union diplomat in Kyiv who now works for R. Politik, a political analysis firm, said that Russia\u2019s upper hand on the battlefield had most likely played a role in Mr. Trump\u2019s agreeing to aim for a peace deal rather than a cease-fire. \u201cKyiv and Europe must adapt to a new reality shaped by Washington and Moscow,\u201d he said.\n\nThe power of the Trump-Putin presidential photo op. President Vladimir V. Putin and President Trump at Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson in Anchorage on Friday. In the end there was no deal, but there was a photo op: a dramatic, well-choreographed image of President Trump not just welcoming President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to Alaska on Friday, but rolling out the red carpet, that now-universal symbol of fame, pageantry and pomp. The two men clasped hands, and then strode to Mr. Trump\u2019s limo, in complementary dark suits \u2014 single-breasted, two-button \u2014 matching white shirts and coordinating ties (red for Mr. Trump, burgundy for Mr. Putin), giving the impression of kindred spirits: just two statesmen meeting on the semi-neutral ground of an airport tarmac to go talk cease-fire, their respective planes looming in the background. That\u2019s the picture that was caught by the waiting cameras, and those are the photos that have gone around the world to accompany reports of the nonproductive meeting. In the absence of an actual resolution to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, they have become the takeaway. And that, said both President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, even before the meeting, was Mr. Putin\u2019s goal in the first place. \u201cHe is seeking, excuse me, photos,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cHe needs a photo from the meeting with President Trump.\u201d Why? Because whatever happened afterward, a photo could be publicly seen \u2014 and read \u2014 as an implicit endorsement. After all, the Russian president has been a virtual pariah in the West since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine; accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court. Whether or not Mr. Trump was tough with him behind the closed doors of their meeting room \u2014 whether or not their talks were, as Mr. Trump later said, \u201cproductive\u201d \u2014 what has now been preserved for posterity is Mr. Putin\u2019s admission back into the fold. And of all current world leaders, the only one who understands, and embraces, the power of the image quite as effectively as Mr. Trump is Mr. Putin. Both men have made themselves into caricatures through costume and scenography, the better to capture the popular imagination. Mr. Trump has done it with his MAGA merch, his red-white-and-blue dressing (the one regularly adopted by members of his cabinet as well as Republicans in Congress), his hair and his showmanship. Mr. Putin has done it with his orchestrated photo shoots: the ones that capture him braving the snow in Siberia, hugging a polar bear, hunting shirtless. They may look silly (at least from outside) but that doesn\u2019t make them any less effective. Or headline-grabbing. That Mr. Putin met Mr. Trump in the uniform Mr. Trump embraces made its own kind of statement. The conflict in Ukraine has been in part a battle fought in images for the support of the global imagination; that is why Mr. Zelensky insists on dressing to show solidarity with his fighting forces whenever he speaks to international bodies, be they Congress or the European Union; why his wife posed for the cover of Vogue. By wearing his suit and tie in Alaska, Mr. Putin cast himself as Mr. Trump\u2019s equal and drew another line between himself and Mr. Zelensky, who famously offended Mr. Trump by wearing his army look to the White House Their handshake \u2014 which went on for a while and also involved various friendly pats \u2014 was a pantomime of acceptance of that idea. And the photo was everyone\u2019s souvenir.\n\nPresident Trump speaking with reporters on Air Force One on his way to Alaska on Friday. After his summit with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday, President Trump sat down with the Fox News host Sean Hannity to record an interview in which he offered few details about what the two leaders had said about the war in Ukraine, but talked up their personal connection. \u201cI think the meeting was a 10,\u201d Mr. Trump said after Mr. Hannity asked how he would rate his talks with the Russian president. \u201cIn the sense we got along great, and it\u2019s good when two big powers get along, especially when they\u2019re nuclear powers. We\u2019re No. 1 and they\u2019re No. 2 in the world.\u201d Without sharing any specific information from the meeting in Alaska, Mr. Trump put the onus for securing peace on Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cNow it is really up to President Zelensky to get it done,\u201d he said during the interview, which was broadcast later on Fox News. \u201cI would also say the European nations have to get involved a little bit.\u201d In the interview, Mr. Trump repeatedly praised Mr. Putin, and brought up compliments he received from the Russian leader during the summit. \u201cI always had a great relationship with President Putin,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd we would have done great things together.\u201d He claimed that Mr. Putin had even supported his claim that the 2020 U.S. presidential election, which Mr. Trump lost to Joseph R. Biden Jr., was rigged. \u201cHe said, \u2018Your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. Putin told him that by-mail voting does not exist anywhere else in the world. Whether Mr. Putin actually said that or not, several countries have by-mail voting. And Mr. Trump\u2019s own attorney general in 2020 said his assertions of widespread fraud couldn\u2019t be proven. During the interview, Mr. Trump mused about a three-way summit between himself, Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Putin but said explicitly, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask about it.\u201d Twenty minutes after saying that, Mr. Trump said he had in fact discussed that with Mr. Putin. \u201cThey both want me there,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I will be there.\u201d Mr. Zelensky said on Saturday that he would travel to Washington on Monday to discuss the war with Mr. Trump. Earlier on Friday, the Ukrainian leader had criticized Russia\u2019s latest attacks and cast doubt on Mr. Putin\u2019s commitment to ending the war. But Mr. Trump told Mr. Hannity that he thinks the Russian leader wants to \u201csolve the problem.\u201d He did not acknowledge that Mr. Putin had started the war.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier firing at Russian targets in the Donetsk region in June. The area is part of the Donbas, which Moscow seeks to capture. Russia entered Friday\u2019s inconclusive talks with the United States from a position of strength on the battlefield in Ukraine. It is a position Russia is likely to keep exploiting, as President Trump on Saturday seemed to rule out any prospect of an imminent cease-fire. The Russian Army has driven a wedge into Ukrainian defenses in the east, and Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow has massed forces and equipment for new offensive operations. In recent days, Russian forces broke through a section of Ukrainian defenses in the eastern Donbas region, an area that Moscow has long sought to capture but currently controls only about three-quarters of. Russian troops advanced about 10 miles deep into the Ukrainian rear, threatening to outflank Ukraine\u2019s positions. The Russian advance now appears to have been stopped, and in some areas even pushed back. But military analysts note that the breach could still provide Russia with a new staging ground for future attacks, advancing its broader goal of seizing the remainder of the Donbas. It is a stark contrast from the Kremlin\u2019s position more than three years ago, during early peace talks in Istanbul. Back then, Russia\u2019s army had made a failed attempt to capture Kyiv and was reeling from devastating Ukrainian counterattacks. Mr. Putin\u2019s initial plan \u2014 to swiftly seize all of Ukraine, decapitate its military and political leadership and replace it with Moscow-friendly authorities \u2014 had to be abandoned. Russian troops withdrew to the east and south, where they refocused the fighting. Since then, Russian forces have slowly but steadily captured Ukrainian territory. Since it launched its full-scale invasion in early 2022, Russia has captured roughly 27,000 square miles of territory in Ukraine, about the size of Ireland. This adds to the 17,000 square miles it already controlled from what is seen as the first phase of the war, which began in 2014. Altogether, Russia now controls nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory. Ukraine holds a small sliver of land in the western Russian region of Kursk. That is a remnant of last year\u2019s incursion, when its troops captured thousands of square miles and held them for months before Russia pushed them back early this year. On other parts of the front line, Ukraine has been gradually retreating under relentless assaults. The Russian advance, however, has come at a steep price. About 230,000 Russian soldiers have died since the beginning of the invasion, according to estimates based on obituaries collected by the independent news outlet Mediazona and BBC News Russian. Ukrainian losses are estimated at less than half of Russia\u2019s. But Moscow has been able to rebuild and even expand its battered force by tapping into a population that is four times larger than Ukraine\u2019s. Meanwhile, Kyiv has struggled to replenish its army through conscription. This largely explains why Russia now has the upper hand on the battlefield. Ukraine doesn\u2019t have enough soldiers to hold its lines, allowing Russian troops to slip through, as they did in the east in recent days, near the city of Pokrovsk. The Ukrainian army rushed elite brigades to the area to halt the Russian advance. But many Ukrainian soldiers saw the Russian breach as a stark warning of what could happened in the coming months if Ukraine does not address its personnel shortages, lack of coordination between units and poorly planned counterattacks. \u201cThis disaster has been building for a long time, worsening day by day,\u201d Bohdan Krotevych, the former chief of staff of Ukraine\u2019s Azov brigade and a National Guard lieutenant colonel, wrote on social media.\n\nTrump and Putin had an isolated conversation in Trump\u2019s limo. President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska on Friday. At the summit in Alaska on Friday between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, before their formal discussions on Ukraine, the two leaders had a brief conversation isolated from any aides or journalists in the U.S. president\u2019s limousine. In the apparently unplanned encounter, they were accompanied only by two security officers in the front of the eight-ton armored car. It left many wondering: What exactly did they talk about? The two leaders were set to be picked up separately after they descended from their planes. Mr. Putin\u2019s own presidential limousine was ready on the tarmac. But after they greeted each other, Mr. Trump gestured for Mr. Putin to walk with him toward the American presidential vehicle. They slipped into the back of the limousine, called the Beast, and rode together to the nearby military facility where the talks would take place. As the car drove away, news cameras captured Mr. Putin flashing a wide smile and waving his hand. Other world leaders have been offered rides in the Beast in the past, but it is unusual for someone from a rival country to be invited, especially with no one else. There did not appear to be any interpreters in the car with Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin on Friday. Mr. Putin is known to speak English well enough to hold a conversation. Neither leader has shared what was said during that short ride, and it remained unknown hours later. It has added to the mystery of what they discuss in private, much like their meeting in Hamburg, Germany, in 2017, at the beginning of Mr. Trump\u2019s first term. After that meeting, Mr. Trump never revealed publicly what was discussed. His secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, were the only others in the room aside from the interpreters. Mr. Trump also took away his interpreter\u2019s notes. During that visit to Germany for a Group of 20 leaders meeting, Mr. Trump pulled up a chair next to Mr. Putin at a dinner to talk. No American officials were present, and the White House did not confirm the exchange until more than 10 days later, after it had been independently reported.\n\nThe U.S. was one of the few Western nations Putin could visit without risking arrest. The International Criminal Court has accused President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of war crimes. When the International Criminal Court accused President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of war crimes in 2023 and issued a warrant for his arrest, the move was largely symbolic because there was little chance he would stand trial. But it immediately jeopardized Mr. Putin\u2019s ability to travel to the more than 120 countries that have signed on to the I.C.C. They include almost every nation in Europe and dozens more in Africa, Asia and Latin America. They are all legally required to arrest Mr. Putin and send him to The Hague if he sets foot on their soil. But Mr. Putin\u2019s visit to Alaska on Friday highlighted a notable exception. To prevent the world\u2019s highest criminal court from being used to prosecute Americans, the United States has long refused to join the I.C.C., created over 20 years ago under the 1998 Rome Statute to handle accusations of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. As a result, the United States is virtually the only country in the West that Mr. Putin can visit without worrying about arrest. Only a handful of other major powers, including China, India, Russia and Israel, have abstained from becoming signatories to the court. Even before the I.C.C. warrant for Mr. Putin was issued, it had been rare for him to travel abroad. He spent the first two years of the Covid pandemic in Russia, a period of isolation that some U.S. intelligence officials speculated might have heightened his appetite for risk and influenced his decision to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The I.C.C. has accused Mr. Putin of bearing criminal responsibility for the abduction and deportation of Ukrainian children after Russia launched its invasion. But the court cannot try absent defendants, and Russia, which is not a party to the I.C.C., has dismissed the warrants as \u201cmeaningless.\u201d Though the court has no enforcement mechanism, the symbolic weight of its arrest warrant for Mr. Putin has forced members and nonmembers alike to decide whether they are willing to take the diplomatic risk of hosting a wanted man. That risk has not been enough to stop several countries that are friendly with Moscow \u2014 or reliant on it \u2014 from welcoming Mr. Putin. Since 2023, he has made repeated visits to China, Belarus and several Central Asian countries. In September, he was given a red-carpet welcome in Mongolia, which is a party to the I.C.C. but depends on neighboring Russia for most of its fuel. Mongolia isn\u2019t the only country to have defied its obligation to the court. South Africa did so in 2015, when it allowed Omar Hassan al-Bashir, then the Sudanese president, to fly in and out of Johannesburg while he was wanted by the I.C.C. on accusations of genocide and war crimes in his country\u2019s Darfur region. Mr. Bashir remains at large, a prominent example of the court\u2019s limitations. Last year, South Africa faced a dilemma over whether to permit Mr. Putin to attend the annual summit of BRICS nations. After months of speculation, the Kremlin announced that Mr. Putin would attend remotely. Mr. Putin is one of only a few sitting leaders facing an outstanding arrest warrant from the I.C.C. Another is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, whom the court last year accused of carrying out war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office has categorically rejected what it called \u201cabsurd and false accusations.\u201d The United States, Israel\u2019s chief ally, also denounced the I.C.C. warrant for Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s arrest, and President Trump has since hosted the Israeli leader three times at the White House.\n\nPutin flatters Trump by echoing his claims about the war in Ukraine. President Trump with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during a joint address in Anchorage on Friday. As President Trump has endeavored to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine, he has repeatedly described it as former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s war, and claimed it would have never started under his watch. Until Friday, when Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin met in Alaska to discuss the conflict, it seemed a boastful refrain that gave Mr. Trump cover for failing to stop a three-year-war he said he could stop within 24 hours of taking office. But, after the meeting, Mr. Putin made a point of echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in 2022 if he had still been president, a striking bit of flattery as the two men put on a show of warmth and friendship even as they walked away without a deal. \u201cToday we hear President Trump say, \u2018If I were president, there would be no war,\u2019\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cI think that would actually happen. I confirm this.\u201d \u201cI think that overall, me and President Trump have built a very good businesslike and trustworthy contact,\u201d he added, \u201cand have every reason to believe that moving down this path, we can come \u2014 and the sooner the better \u2014 to the end of the conflict in Ukraine.\u201d Mr. Trump regularly attacks his predecessor, Mr. Biden, and on Friday the Russian president did the same, saying, \u201cI tried to convince my previous American colleague the situation should not be brought to the point of no return when it would come to hostilities, and I said it quite directly back then, it\u2019s a big mistake.\u201d Like many world leaders, Mr. Putin appeared to embrace flattery when it comes to dealing with Mr. Trump. In addition to praising Mr. Trump as an earnest peacemaker, he commended the president for the \u201cwell wishing and trustworthy tone of our conversation.\u201d He said that a meeting between U.S. and Russian leaders were \u201clong overdue\u201d and commended Mr. Trump for caring about the prosperity of the United States as well as Russia\u2019s national interests. After Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, concluded his remarks, Mr. Trump called his statements \u201cprofound.\u201d But Mr. Trump had little to say after that. He announced no cease-fire deal, saying that he would report back to Ukraine and its allies what had been discussed.\n\nIn Russia, Putin\u2019s meeting with Trump plays as a triumph. President Trump with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The leaders greeted one another warmly at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. There was pronounced gloating in Russia over Friday\u2019s summit in Alaska, where President Vladimir V. Putin was given the red carpet treatment by President Trump on American soil and appeared to make a huge dent in more than three years of diplomatic isolation. Ending the war in Ukraine had been on the agenda, but neither Mr. Putin nor Mr. Trump announced a cease-fire deal after the nearly three-hour meeting. In fact, during the news conference afterward, the Russian leader made a reference to the \u201croot causes\u201d of the conflict. It was his shorthand for Russia\u2019s insistence that any threat from Kyiv as perceived by Moscow had to be removed, including seizing territory in eastern Ukraine and installing a government that was not hostile to the Kremlin. Mr. Putin\u2019s remarks showed that the Kremlin\u2019s position was \u201cunwavering,\u201d crowed Andrei Gurulyov, a retired general who is now a member of Russia\u2019s Parliament. Mr. Gurulyov, speaking on his Telegram channel, argued that the meeting could be called a breakthrough because Mr. Putin was able to explain \u201cface to face\u201d to Mr. Trump the reasons for the war. \u201cThe meeting of the presidents of Russia and the USA is a breakthrough already after what has been happening,\u201d he said. The joint appearance in Alaska occurred around 2 a.m. in Moscow, so there was limited reaction from Russian commentators and officials. But Russian state television started playing the joint appearance featuring Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump \u2014 where neither leader took questions \u2014 repeatedly, a sure sign that the Kremlin thought it had triumphed. The reports stressed the seemingly warm chemistry between the two leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the statements made by both presidents that a huge step forward has been made,\u201d said a correspondent reporting from Alaska on the state-run Rossiya 24 news channel. Another report on the channel noted that the entire meeting was likely to cause chagrin among American allies in Europe. It said: \u201cYou can understand Europeans: The red carpet and a warm, nearly friendly handshake can hardly fit into the narrative they have been working through for three years about Russia being a pariah country. And it looks like there will be no lack of such discoveries for the Old World.\u201d The official TASS news agency filed an urgent bulletin from the joint appearance to note that Mr. Putin, speaking in English, had invited Mr. Trump to hold their next meeting in Moscow. Mr. Trump was polite but noncommittal, calling the idea interesting but that he would \u201ctake a lot of heat for it.\u201d Russian critics of Mr. Putin and the war in Ukraine wondered if Mr. Trump would follow through on his previous threat to impose direct and secondary sanctions if Russia did not move to end the fighting. The Kremlin had asked for the meeting on the eve of the deadline Mr. Trump had set for the sanctions. \u201cNow the main question is what will happen with the previously announced sanctions?\u201d Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst, wrote on Telegram. \u201cWill Trump impose them and in what form? Without this, Putin will look like the winner.\u201d",

  "summary": "President Trump has split from Ukraine and key European allies after his summit with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, where he endorsed Putin's plan for a comprehensive peace agreement based on Ukraine ceding territory it controls to Russia. This move contradicts a strategy agreed upon by both Trump and European allies before the U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska. Despite initially threatening economic penalties if Putin left the meeting without a deal to end the war, Trump has since suspended these threats. European leaders have not endorsed Trump's changed stance on peace, nor directly contradicted it. Ukraine was left scrambling to piece together what the two leaders had discussed and avoid being sidelined. Putin has previously broken similar promises to Ukraine or any European country.",

My ambition is to unpack this very complex region for our readers. To do that, I am committed to covering all aspects of life in Russia and beyond, including its rapid economic and cultural transformation and how it\u2019s impacting Russian society. I am especially interested in stories that can humanize our reader\u2019s understanding of what life is like in these countries.\nMy Background\nI have been covering Russia and the region as a journalist since 2013, when I started working for The Moscow Times and several independent Russian news outlets. I joined The Times in 2015 as a reporter and researcher in the Moscow bureau. Throughout the past decade, I have witnessed key events in the region, including the Sochi Olympics, Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine\u2019s east, escalating tensions between Moscow and Washington, and the ongoing war in Ukraine.\nI come from a very mixed background that helps me see the story I cover from various angles. I was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, but spent much of my formative years being raised by my grandparents in the small town of Piatykhatky in central Ukraine. For seven years, I studied and worked in Canada and Britain, where I earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations from the University of Calgary and a master\u2019s in international relations from the London School of Economics.\nJournalistic Ethics\nI am guided by our mission: we seek the truth and help people understand the world.

Green\nAlong with the rest of the White House team, I cover the daily decisions, comings and goings and newsworthy events involving the president, the vice president and other members of his cabinet.\nWhile I am particularly interested in social policy and civil rights, I cover a range of topics spanning domestic and foreign policy. I\u2019m also drawn to stories that illustrate how the decisions made on Pennsylvania Avenue impact the American people, and shape the dynamics of American society. I look to broaden my coverage from beyond the Beltway to ensure that Americans are represented alongside the administration, which I believe is crucial to holding them accountable to the people they are elected to serve.\nI joined the White House beat in the summer of 2023, and covered the last year-and-a-half of the Biden administration, as well as the 2024 presidential campaign.\nBefore then, I covered education for 13 years, more than six of them at The Times. I started at The Times in 2017 to cover former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and federal education policy. Many of my stories focused on the political tumult that the nation\u2019s K-12 schools and higher education institutions navigated during Trump\u2019s first term. I also reported a myriad other features and investigations on school districts across the country, with a focus on civil rights and marginalized student populations, including the dismal educational outcomes for Native American students; the disproportionate disciplining of Black girls in school; and the secret and illegal suspensions of special education students. I also coauthored a Times investigation exposing the leaders of a Louisiana school who abused students and falsified their college applications to get them into the Ivy League. The story was the debut episode on The Times\u2019 television show \u201cThe Weekly,\u201d and is the subject of an upcoming book. In 2022, I was recognized as the best education beat reporter in the country by the Education Writers Association.\nBefore joining The Times, I covered education at my hometown paper, The Baltimore Sun, for seven years. While there, I was also part of the team named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, and the riots that resulted. I coauthored a book about the riots, \u201cFive Days: The Fiery Reckoning of an American City,\u201d that documented the events.\nI graduated from Goucher College with a bachelor\u2019s degree in communications, and I received my master\u2019s degree in journalism from Northwestern University.\nMaintaining journalistic independence is important for every journalist at The Times, which has extensive ethics guidelines that I follow. I want all of my work to be accurate and fair. I go above and beyond to ensure that multiple viewpoints are heard and represented in my coverage, but I do not allow that to devolve into false equivalencies or distract from the irrefutable truths readers should know. I value the trust I build with my sources, and fiercely protect them. I do not accept gifts, money or favors from anyone who might figure into my reporting. I do not make political donations.

He said over and over again, including at both presidential debates of 2024, that he would have the war \u201csettled\u201d when he was president-elect, before his inauguration.\nA Friday search of the Roll Call Factba.se database that catalogues Trump\u2019s public remarks turned up at least 53 examples of Trump making such comments.\nIt\u2019s sometimes hard to determine the intent of a politician\u2019s one-time ad-libs, but this was no jovial ad-lib. Rather, the promise of a rapid end to the war was a sober staple of Trump\u2019s pre-written rally remarks. He framed the promise as a key component of his second-term agenda, and he justified it with claims about his \u201ccredibility\u201d as a leader, his history as a \u201cpeacemaker,\u201d and his knowledge of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nTrump sometimes emphasized that he was speaking literally, scoffing at critics who said he couldn\u2019t end the war that fast. \u201cI\u2019ll get that done within 24 hours. Everyone says, \u2018Oh, no, you can\u2019t.\u2019 Absolutely I can. Absolutely I can,\u201d he said at one July 2023 rally in Iowa. He said at a Pennsylvania rally later that month: \u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we all together win the presidency, we will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. It will be settled. The war is going to be settled. I\u2019ll get them both \u2013 I know Zelensky, I know Putin, it\u2019ll be done within 24 hours, you watch. They all say, \u2018That\u2019s such a boast.\u2019 It will be done very quickly.\u201d\nHere are the 53 examples. There might well be more; this isn\u2019t intended as an exhaustive list.\nMarch 4, 2023. Speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.\n\u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled.

Rally in Waco, Texas.\n\u201cAnd before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled.\u201d And: \u201cSo when I say \u2018end it,\u2019 I\u2019m going to get a settlement very quickly. And I know both people, and you can get it very, very quickly. You can only do it through the presidency, but you control the money coming in, coming out. You can get that.

CNN town hall in Goffstown, New Hampshire.\nTrump: \u201cIf I\u2019m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins: \u201cHow would you settle that war in one day?\u201d Trump: \u201cFirst, I\u2019ll meet with Putin, I\u2019ll meet with Zelensky. They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths. And within 24 hours that war will be settled. It will be over. It will be absolutely over.\u201d\nJune 10, 2023.

Speech to Republican women in Concord, New Hampshire.\n\u201cI get along with him (Zelensky), get along with Putin, I\u2019d have that war \u2013 it would have never happened under me, never ever, would have never happened \u2013 but I\u2019ll have that war settled in 24 hours.

Twice.\nThe designer\u2019s innovations \u2014 for the chief executive and the celebrity \u2014 made Armani a household name.\nBy Vanessa Friedman\nI focus on fashion as an expression of political, social and cultural identity at a specific moment in time, especially how it is used by those in the public eye to communicate values and influence opinion.

European allies and Ukraine reacted with disapproval, warning that the move gives Moscow a battlefield advantage and undermines earlier agreements. Trump\u2019s post\u2011summit statements and social media posts further amplified the shift, while Zelensky plans a Washington meeting to clarify the U.S. stance. The development signals a potential realignment of U.S. policy toward the Ukraine conflict and raises concerns about the effectiveness of sanctions and diplomatic leverage.",
