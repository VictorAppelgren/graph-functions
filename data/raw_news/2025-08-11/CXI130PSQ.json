  "content": "With unforgiving fan bases, rising expectations in competitive conferences and money flowing directly to players and unforgiving fan bases, the pressure has never been higher across college football. All that means the coaches at thes six programs will be feeling the heat this season.\n\nOklahoma: The clock is ticking for Brent Venables, who heads into his fourth season in Norman yet to meet the expectations that come with this storied program. His sole winning season is sandwiched between 6-7 records in 2022 and 2024. He\u2019s yet to lead the Sooners to a bowl win, going 0-3, and the Cheez-It, Alamo and Armed Forces bowls aren\u2019t where Oklahoma fans want to end the year.\n\nOklahoma finished with a 2-6 conference record in its inaugural season in the SEC a year ago while fellow newbie and rival Texas topped the conference. Entering year two in the SEC, Venables could use a standout year.\n\nAuburn: Hugh Freeze is treading water after opening with two seven-loss seasons. Recruiting efforts have been admirable, but in-game decisions in high-pressure moments have raised concerns. Auburn hasn\u2019t hesitated to part ways with coaches in recent years, and Freeze could be next on the chopping block if he doesn\u2019t produce fast results. Getting Georgia and Alabama at home might help \u2026 right?\n\nArkansas: What to do with Sam Pittman? He is a folksy, charming guy and he has three winning seasons out of five for the Razorbacks that included bowl wins. But he is 30-31 overall and Arkansas has not emerged as any kind of a consistent threat in the SEC.\n\nExpectations were high for Pittman after a 9-4 season in 2021 but the Hogs look like a mostly middling program. The schedule this year includes visits to Ole Miss, Tennessee and, on back-to-back weekends, LSU and Texas.\n\nFlorida: Billy Napier\u2019s tenure in Florida started with 6-7 and 5-7 records before last year\u2019s 8-5 finish that included a 4-4 mark in the SEC. Does gradual improvement meet the high standards of a historically dominant program?\n\nA dominant season by quarterback D.J. Lagway and a few marquee wins could help Napier\u2019s job security. The Gators won\u2019t have to wait long to see how they stack up: A four-game stretch that starts in Week 3 features LSU, Miami, Texas and Texas A&M, with only the Longhorns visiting the Swamp of the group.\n\nWisconsin: After two full seasons at the helm, Luke Fickell could use a breakout season. Wisconsin went 5-7 last year after a 7-6 finish in his first full season, easily an afterthought in a Big Ten Conference that grabbed two national titles. Inconsistent quarterback play, injuries and a difficult schedule have troubled the Badgers.\n\nFickell\u2019s strong run at Cincinnati seems a long time ago now. Up next is a schedule that includes visits to Alabama, Michigan and Oregon. At least Ohio State is at Camp Randall Stadium.\n\nUCLA: Lincoln Riley\u2019s first year with the Trojans felt somewhat magical for a while, an 11-3 effort stymied by a pair of losses to Utah and one-point bowl loss to Tulane. What\u2019s followed has warmed things up for Riley: an 8-5 record in 2023 and a 7-6 mark last year.\n\nMuch of Riley\u2019s fate could be in the hands of quarterback Jayden Maiava but the Trojans would love to see new assistant and former NFL veteran Rob Ryan field a shutdown defense.\n\nHonorable mentions, starting with Alabama: Kalen DeBoer saw his team put up a 9-4 mark in his first season in Tuscaloosa; the Crimson Tide will need to be better than that \u2014 as in, make the College Football Playoff.\n\nOklahoma State: The Cowboys went 12-2 in 2021 but Mike Gundy\u2019s teams have been inconsistent for a while now and last year\u2019s 3-9 collapse raised questions about the veteran coach.\n\nFlorida State: Mike Norvell has had two good seasons sandwiched by two bad ones, including last year\u2019s 2-10 mark. Surely everyone in Tallahassee heard former coach Jimbo Fisher tell a podcast last week he was ready to come back to the right situation in college football?",

  "summary": "The pressure on college football coaches is increasing across the country this season due to increased expectations and increased financial demands. Oklahoma's Brent Venables is under pressure, yet to meet expectations and has yet to lead the team to a bowl win. Meanwhile, Auburn's Hugh Freeze is struggling with two seven-loss seasons and could be next to be replaced if he fails to meet the high expectations of his peers. Meanwhile in the SEC, Arkansas's Sam Pittman has only won three of five games out of five for the Razorbacks, while Florida's Billy Napier's tenure began with 6-7 and 5-7 records before last year's 8-5 finish. Wisconsin's Luke Fickell is looking for a breakthrough season after two full seasons in charge, while Oklahoma State's Mike Gundy's teams have been inconsistent, while Mike Norvell's 2-9 collapse last year has raised questions about his coaching.",
