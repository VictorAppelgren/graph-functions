      "feedback": "Strengths: the piece synthesizes a multi-source, multi-asset narrative and rightly links a multi-year, structural horizon to aging demographics, health-cost risk, and a secular cloud/AI growth backdrop that can support moats and durable cash flow (cited by YVQU6QCY4; IGP1Q4ZEJ; 0G3A676BP); it also nodes long-horizon valuation dynamics to “forever stocks” like Microsoft and Shopify and to moat-driven health care and consumer franchises (0G3A676BP; IGP1Q4ZEJ). Key gaps: it does not ground the analysis in explicit first-principles anchors or invariant regimes (e.g., real rate differentials, productivity growth in cloud/AI, terms-of-trade, BoP, net external position, policy reaction functions) that would structure a durable multi-year framework; it lacks a formal regime/transition map with clear triggers (inflation, productivity shocks, aging-cost escalations, tariff/policy shifts) and does not translate those into a transparent causal chain from fundamentals to market pricing; it under-quantifies and over-relies on qualitative risk mention (inflation/tariffs/long-term care) without embedding precise magnitudes or probabilities; and its citation discipline is uneven (claims like “six figures” LTC costs, 3.7% safe withdrawal, and specific tariff-driven price paths should be anchored to exact figures from the cited sources and reconciled where sources conflict). Actionable edits: rebuild as a two-tier horizon with invariant anchors and regime logic (a) add first-principles anchors: quantify aging-driven health-cost growth, plausible long-run productivity gains from cloud/AI, and real-rate paths consistent with major sources; (b) formalize a multi-regime framework (e.g., high-growth/low-inflation, inflationary/sticky-inflation, tariff/shock regime) with transition conditions and probabilistic validity; (c) replace broad claims with quantified inputs and outputs drawn from the sources (e.g., LTC costs circa $115k/year per person per 4 Retirement Expenses; 3.7% safe withdrawal rate; 401(k)/IRA contribution caps for 2025; UnitedHealth and Lululemon financials from IGP1Q4ZEJ; cloud/AI CAGR from the Fool cloud piece); (d) strengthen the causal chain by mapping each fundamental to a market price channel (earnings power, cash flow, multiples, dividend capacity, balance-sheet resilience) and attach explicit magnitudes; (e) deliver a clean base-case, bull-case, and bear-case with transition triggers and observable watchpoints (e.g., inflation persistence, healthcare-cost accelerants, tariff pass-through, demographic shocks); (f) tighten the citation discipline: cite every quantitative claim to one of the IDs (YVQU6QCY4;  IG P1Q4ZEJ; 0G3A676BP; JHGBQ4TQH; TN66GHPAT; etc.) and remove non-ID URLs from the body while including a concise source map; (g) reconcile conflicts by stating when one source uses a lower-bound estimate (e.g., LTC cost range) vs. another, and present a sensitivity band; (h) enhance formatting to satisfy SECTION FOCUS: outline horizons, state regimes, present the invariant chain, base-case, risks, watchlist, and confidence with explicit, source-backed numbers; (i) ensure every assertion about market pricing has a clear transmission path (demographics → health-cost pressure → retirement budgets; cloud/AI demand → moat earnings → valuations; tariffs/inflation → consumer affordability → earnings/multiples). In short, convert the piece into a rigorously sourced, first-principles–anchored, regime-based framework with explicit magnitudes and a transparent sources map anchored to IDs (YVQU6QCY4; IGP1Q4ZEJ; 0G3A676BP; JHGBQ4TQH; TN66GHPAT), plus a structured base-case plus clearly defined risks and watchpoints.",
