  "description": "Warner Bros. shelved this raunchy, R-rated animated comedy and Netflix saved it \u2014 Samurai Jack's creator explains why that means so much to him",
  "content": "Fixed, the raunchy new animated Netflix movie from Samurai Jack and Primal creator Genndy Tartakovsky, follows a mutt named Bull (Adam DeVine) who\u2019s about to get neutered, and copes by spending a raucous night out with his buddies. It almost didn\u2019t get released: Tartakovsky had to censor some of the art to get approval for the R-rated film, but even after that, Warner Bros. Discovery declined to release the movie. which stayed shelved until Netflix picked it up for release. Tartakovsky, who co-scripted Fixed along with The Simpsons Movie writer Jon Vitti, says he was determined to get it to audiences, because it\u2019s a deeply personal film.\n\n\u201cThe movie\u2019s based on my friend group since high school,\u201d Tartakovsky told Polygon in a Zoom interview. \u201cThey worked on the movie with me, in the beginning especially. I thought it would be fun, because they\u2019re both writers \u2014 one\u2019s in advertising and one\u2019s a sports writer \u2014 so we were able to collaborate. It was really fun to work with my best friends.\u201d\n\nTartakovsky and his friends crafted silly exaggerations of their group. One guy with a chip on his shoulder became Rocco (Idris Elba), a boxer constantly bringing up how he wasn\u2019t breastfed because his mom had so many puppies. The dog pals also feature Lucky (Bobby Moynihan), a beagle who waxes philosophical when he isn\u2019t eating poop, and Fetch (Fred Armisen), a dachshund influencer constantly sporting new outfits that Tartakovsky came up with by doodling.\n\n\u201cI tried not to look online [for inspiration], because I knew that was going to be a rabbit hole of way too much. So I just thought, \u2018What would be really funny?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI also tried not to draw attention to it too much. When people look at it, they could just giggle once they realize he\u2019s wearing a beret and a turtleneck or something.\u201d\n\nTartakovsky says he had to make sure the jokes didn\u2019t just appeal to him and his friends, which is why he cut the character who was meant as a stand-in for him: a Siberian Husky with a thick Russian accent, constantly saying things that didn\u2019t make any sense.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was too specific and weird; that was probably more in my own head,\u201d Tartakovsky said. \u201cI probably could have made it work, but it seemed like a fine sacrifice, because it\u2019s hard to have a lot of characters, because everybody\u2019s got to say something.\u201d\n\nFixed is set in Chicago, where Tartakovsky went to high school. Bull romps around the \u201cWiggly Field Dog Park\u201d and gorges himself at a food festival based on the annual Taste of Chicago event.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have the opportunity to make it like Annie Hall, Woody Allen\u2019s tribute to New York,\u201d Tartakovsky said. \u201cIt was nothing that sophisticated. But it was just enough that there\u2019s a city feel in the way we drew the buildings and the houses where they live.\u201d\n\nAlong with his human friends, Tartakovsky also found inspiration for Fixed in his own dogs. \u201cMy three dogs all have three different personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Saint Bernard is giant and kind of loafy and lovable, and he sleeps for 20 hours of the day. The King Charles Alfie is kind of cranky and slow. I used to have two Saint Bernards, so he grew up with Saint Bernards, and I think he thinks he\u2019s a Saint Bernard. When one of them passed away, we got another King Charles [that] was more energetic, and they\u2019re running around, and all of a sudden Alfie started to [embody] those traits.\u201d\n\nThe Fixed cast also told Polygon they looked to real canines to get into their roles.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t currently have one, but my neighbor\u2019s dog humps everything and has big old floppy nuts, so I try to channel his dog as Bull,\u201d DeVine said.\n\nBeck Bennett, who plays Bull\u2019s arrogant Borzoi rival Sterling, said he mostly modeled his character after Bradley Whitford\u2019s performance in Billy Madison.\n\n\u201cI have a Yorkie/terrier/shih tzu mix, an incredible dog who is nothing like my character,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, I thought about what kind of dog would piss my dog off, and tried to bring that to the record.\u201d\n\nTartakovsky said one of his favorite episodes of Dexter\u2019s Laboratory is when the boy genius invents a device to communicate with a lost dog, only to find that the animal\u2019s thoughts just aren\u2019t that deep. They basically amount to \u201cFeed me now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think a dog would be more complicated, but they\u2019re just [saying] exactly what they want,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have such an amazing relationship with our animals, and we imbue so much personality on them, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not.\u201d\n\nFixed is now streaming on Netflix.",

It first aired on January 28, 1998.\nIn this episode, Dexter meets a stray Labrador Retriever that follows him while he walks home from school. At first, Dexter couldn't understand what the dog is saying due to its constant barking, but he soon comes up with a plan to make the dog speak like a human. Unfortunately for Dexter, the dog's endless talking drives Dexter crazy, up to the point where he tries to reunite the dog with his owner.\nPlot[]\nDexter is walking home from school reading his math textbook until he passes by a labrador retriever that barks at him. After it runs a circle around him, Dexter pats the dog and tells it not to follow him. It does so for a few more feet, then it barks at Dexter once more, forcing him to race back home and into his laboratory, where the dog was waiting for him.\nAs Dexter reminds the dog about his laboratory, he is cut off as Dee Dee starts to laugh. Angered by her antics, the labrador retriever chases Dee Dee around, barking while doing so. After catching Dee Dee, the dog returns to Dexter and he plays fetch with it, using Dee Dee as the stick. Dexter praises and admires the dog while Dee Dee leaves feeling annoyed.\nDexter then leaves his lab to go get the dog something to eat, and Dad peers into Dexter's room as he was heading downstairs. In the kitchen, Dexter pulls out a box of Scooby Snacks, but he overhears Dad saying the word \"lab\" then runs upstairs to explain. In his room, Dexter sees Dad with the labrador retriever and gives it a hug as it licks his face.\nWhen Dad asks, Dexter tells him he's not ready for the responsibiities that come with owning a dog, but Dad ignores his remark and lets him keep the labrador retriever. Back inside Dexter's laboratory, the dog fetches Dexter various things, licks him while he wears a suit, and pulls a bone off a parasaurolophus model, causing it and the nearby triceratops head to fall to pieces.\nLater, while Dexter is using a wide computer, the labrador runs toward him barking, but he can't understand what it's trying to tell him. While walking away, Dexter wishes the dog would tell him what he's trying to say and speak simple English. Suddenly, he gets an idea and goes to invent an antibiotic that he puts on top of dog food.\nThe labrador eats away at the dog food, knocking the pill out of the bowl. Dexter notices it on the floor, then inserts it into the dog's mouth, making it swallow the pill. Dexter asks the dog if it understands him, and it does. The dog suddenly remembers what it was trying to tell Dexter about the \"thing\" it saw, but it doesn't make any sense.\nMom then calls everyone to the kitchen for dinner. Dexter takes his seat at the kitchen table while the dog bumps into Dad, Mom, and Dee Dee underneath the table. After Mom serves Dee Dee the chicken and rice, the dog sniffs around wanting food. Dexter tells Dad he already fed him, but Dad orders him to take the dog upstairs.\nThat night in bed, Dexter covers his ears while the dog yells out the window, causing the other dogs in the neighborhood to bark. In the morning, the dog pounces on Dexter's bed and tells him to get up. Dexter then stamps several flyers around the neighborhood, tells the dog it does not belong to him, and goes back home. Just as Dexter enters the front door, the phone rings and he answers. Not long after, the dog and his owner reunite and they both leave to take a ride as Dexter stares out the front door bewildered.\nCharacters[]\nQuotes[]\n- Dee Dee: I don't have to stick around for this.\n- Talking Dog: It's here! The thing! I found the thing and here it is! Here's the thing! Right here! A thing!\n- Talking Dog: It's the stick!\n- Talking Dog: Food for me? Food for me?\n- Mom: Now, now, no chickey and ricey for the puppy.\n- Dad: Now didn't we have a talk about your responsibilities today?\n- Dexter: We? Who's 'We'?\n- Talking Dog: Hey! Hey you dogs! I can hear you barking, I'm a dog! Can you hear me barking? Hey dogs listen to me! I can hear you! Hey! Hey! Hey you!\n- Talking Dog's Owner: Hey it's my dog, I found my dog!\n- Talking Dog: Hey it's my man, I found my man!\nTrivia[]\nCultural References[]\n- Dexter is seen with a box of Scooby Snacks, referencing Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, one of Hanna-Barbera's most popular cartoons.\nProduction Notes[]\n- Dexter's home phone number is revealed to be 555-0100.\n- This episode is produced in 1997 according to the credits.\n- This episode would later replace the Dial M for Monkey episode \"Barbequor\" during reruns, the DVD release of season 1 and on digital streaming services such as HBO Max due to the controversy surrounding the episode."

      "text": "Jack is back.\nAfter 13 years, Samurai Jack is coming back to televisions everywhere with a fifth season that promises to wrap up the journey of the foolish samurai warrior wielding a magic sword, once and for all. Whether you\u2019re an old fan looking to refresh your memory of the series before the new season hits on March 11, or someone who\u2019s curious what all the buzz is about, this post should help.\nSamurai Jack follows the adventures of a lone samurai warrior, stranded in the future, seeking a way to return to his native time period. Jack isn\u2019t even his real name, just the slang that was thrown his way shortly after he arrived in the time period. The show takes place in a variegated, dystopian future Earth: a planet filled with aliens as well as recognizable human cultures, monstrous creatures as well as recognizable earth animals, magic as well as robots \u2014 lots and lots of robots.\nThe appeal of Samurai Jack was never in dense plotting or cliffhanger endings, but in watching animators push their boundaries\nJack wields his father\u2019s magic katana, the only weapon capable of harming the shapeshifting master of darkness \u2014 and overlord of this future earth \u2014 Aku. When Jack stepped forth to oppose Aku in the past, Aku flung him into the future, counting on the fact that he would be all-powerful before he had to reckon with the samurai again.\nJack seeks to return to the past and undo Aku\u2019s future, but his compassionate and righteous nature leads him to offer aid to any who need it, sometimes to the detriment of his larger mission. Aku\u2019s goals are to kill the samurai at all costs \u2014 and to destroy any means he might find of returning to the past. This push and pull between the show\u2019s hero and villain fuel most of Samurai Jack\u2019s 22-minute episodes (and a few two- and three-parters). Jack travels the world searching for time portals and wishing gems, doing good wherever he is needed, while Aku\u2019s minions and the evil wizard himself dog Jack\u2019s every step.\nThat said, Samurai Jack doesn\u2019t really have a continuity, per se. Jack never ends an episode closer to the end of his quest than he was when it started. Episodes can be watched in practically any order, and there are no recurring characters other than Jack and Aku (with one single, memorable exception). Which makes it the perfect series for a Watch or Skip list \u2014 there\u2019s no overarching narrative, just 40-some standalone stories, and it\u2019s all available on Hulu.\nThe appeal of Samurai Jack was never in dense plotting or cliffhanger endings. It was in watching a team of writers and story-boarders craft a perfect samurai movie, trippy magical interlude, noir detective story or epic historical battle in only 22 minutes of set up, payoff, and resolution \u2014 often with virtually no dialogue. It was in watching a team of animators push the boundaries of the show\u2019s hand-painted backgrounds and minimalist design to glorious lengths. Samurai Jack had the sort of deliberately slow pacing, stylized design and highly choreographed action sequences rarely seen in Western action, Western animated action, or Western animated action television.\nHere\u2019s what to watch and what to skip in Samurai Jack\nThe Premiere Movie (S1:E1-E2)\nSamurai Jack premiered on Cartoon Network in 2001 with a 90-minute spot, showing the first three episodes of the series \u2014 \u201cThe Beginning,\u201d \u201cThe Samurai Called Jack\u201d and \u201cThe First Fight\u201d \u2014 back to back. This is the place to start with the series, covering Jack\u2019s origin story, his childhood training and his banishment to the future.\nBut you can skip S1:E3, \u201cThe First Fight.\u201d It opens with a very cute training montage full of talking dogs, but a huge chunk of the episode is devoted to a slow and repetitive fight between Jack and a horde of robotic beetle warriors. This is something of a hallmark Samurai Jack\u2019s first season: The show\u2019s flare for dramatic staging and pacing is undeniable, but once Jack actually comes down to trading blows with an opponent, the fight scenes are unremarkable.\nThis improves greatly over the course of the series, and there\u2019s no reason to subject yourself to it now. \u201cThe First Fight\u201d ends in the same way every other episode of Samurai Jack ends: with Jack walking off into the sunset, neither further or closer to his goal.\nJack, the Woolies and the Chritchellites (S1:E4)\nHere, we have an introduction to the purest form of a Samurai Jack story in the show\u2019s first stand-alone episode. Jack encounters a strange new culture and place, finds something wrong there and rights it, forging a new friend along the way \u2014 only to leave them behind as he continues on his lonely journey.\nJack and the Three Blind Archers (S1:E7)\nMost cartoon shows of its era waited at least a season or two before doing their first no dialogue episode. Samurai Jack barely has any dialogue to begin with, and in its second stand-alone episode it goes even further \u2014 an episode whose climactic battle completely lacks any sound.\nJack vs. Mad Jack (S1:E8)\nAfter setting up its main rivalry so spectacularly in its opening, it actually takes Samurai Jack until its ninth episode to directly involve Aku again. The episode follows the evil wizard essentially pulling Jack\u2019s id out of him and making a Jack-shaped assassin out of it.\nVoice actor Phil LaMarr cited this specific episode as the place he went to when crafting an older, wearier Jack for the new season, so that alone makes it worth a rewatch.\nJack and the Scotsman (S1:E11)\nAgainst the quiet, un-talkative samurai, place Samurai Jack\u2019s only recurring character: the loud, motormouthed Scotsman. He has a machine gun for a peg leg.\n\u201cJack and the Scotsman\u201d is an old story: Two dissimilar warriors meet, they fight, and when they are handcuffed together they must work together to defeat a larger enemy, while bickering the entire way. Show creator Genndy Tartakovsky has confirmed that the Scotsman will return in the final season of the show, so you should brush up on his appearances \u2014 the closest thing the show ever has to a continuity.\nAku\u2019s Fairy Tales (S1:E13)\n\u201cAku\u2019s Fairy Tales\u201d is a glimpse into an alternate universe where Samurai Jack was not renewed after its initial 13-episode order. With no way to know whether they\u2019d get to extend Jack\u2019s adventures beyond one season or not, the folks behind the show managed to create an episode with all the catharsis of a full series wrap up \u2014 but without actually wrapping anything up.\nIt\u2019s also just very funny to watch Aku attempt to rewrite fairy tales so that he is the world\u2019s savior \u2014 as a group of bored children pester him to tell them about their greatest hero, the samurai called Jack.\nJack Learns to Jump Good (S2:E1)\nJack is unable to reach a time portal because he cannot jump high enough, but a tribe of benevolent and peaceful primates train him in their ways of jumping good.\nI promise you, this basic plot is one of the most delightful and compelling episodes of Samurai Jack.\nJack and the Scotsman II (S2:E4)\nThe Scotsman returns.\nJack Remembers the Past (S2:E6)\nIn his travels, Jack discovers the ruins of his now-ancient civilization and his childhood home, and we are treated to several heartwarming vignettes of Jack\u2019s adventures as a child \u2014 a tiny, innocent version of our samurai, before Aku destroyed his home and he spent his adolescence training to defeat him. Also, there\u2019s totally a cameo from Ogami Itt\u014d and Daigor\u014d from Lone Wolf and Cub.\nJack is Naked (S2:E11)\nWhat it says on the tin. A white rabbit steals Jack\u2019s clothing and he spend the entire episode running naked through a strange wonderland, trying to get them back.\nJack and the Spartans (S2:E12)\nSamurai Jack\u2019s first Emmy-winning episode \u2014 and one of its only episodes to be entirely letterboxed into widescreen \u2014 is a better reimagining of the Battle of Thermopylae than either Frank Miller or Zack Snyder have been able to produce.\nPlus, it has robot minotaurs on tank treads.\nJack\u2019s Sandals (S2:E13)\nThe elements of Jack\u2019s ensemble are simple and few \u2014 his sword, his nagaki, the fundoshi beneath it (to preserve his modesty when the nagaki inevitably gets trashed by an enemy), his straw hat and his geta sandals \u2014 and yet Samurai Jack uses every part of the wardrobe buffalo.\nHow else do you explain a charming episode that revolves entirely around Jack\u2019s geta being destroyed by a roving biker gang? The samurai\u2019s search for new footwear eventually leads him to a family who, though they live in the future, lovingly preserve a culture he finds very familiar. Just like the close of the first season of the show, \u201cJack\u2019s Sandals\u201d gives us a welcome look at what life is like for normal people at \u201cpeace\u201d in Aku\u2019s world \u2014 and how the wandering samurai warrior\u2019s heroics proceed him.\nChicken Jack (S3:E1)\nIn this episode, a wizard turns Jack into a rooster for no reason \u2014 and he is scooped up by the unscrupulous boss of an underground robot animal fighting ring and forced to compete without hope of escape \u2014 until he bumps into the wizard again and is turned human for, again, really no reason. Then the episode ends.\nIt\u2019s amazing.\nJack and the Zombies (S3:E4)\nJack and the Zombies is remarkable for being the only episode in the four original seasons of Samurai Jack in which Jack fights and destroys a horde of something other than robots.\nAlso Aku steals Jack\u2019s sword, in order to destroy it so that he will be truly invincible, so that\u2019s pretty high stakes.\nJack and the Traveling Creatures (S3:E7)\nSamurai Jack\u2019s second Emmy-winning episode is also the closest the show has ever come to revealing Jack\u2019s eventual fate \u2014 until now. Its a much watch, if only to see whether Genndy Tartakovsky has really known how all of this was going to end since 2003.\nJack and the Creature (S3:E7)\nJack finds an adorable but somewhat infuriating creature that begins to follow him on his travels.\nAlso, that creature is clearly Totoro, from My Neighbor Totoro.\nJack and the Haunted House (S3:E9)\nSamurai Jack has its standard episodes, and it has its wild divergences in tone and genre. In \u201cJack and the Haunted House,\u201d that divergence is the ghost story, and the show plays upon that theme as well as it does everything else \u2014 and with a brand new this-episode-only art style, as well.\nThe Birth of Evil (S3:E11-12)\nSamurai Jack began with a nearly complete history of Jack\u2019s life. At the end of its third season, we finally get an origin for its antagonist, Aku. In the two installments of \u201cThe Birth of Evil,\u201d we find out how Jack\u2019s sword came to be, how his father managed to defeat Aku a first time. We also learn about how his parents resolved to create at global network of enlightened warriors to train their son to defeat Aku, should he ever rise again.\nSamurai vs. Ninja (S4:E1)\nAsk me to show you a visually arresting episode of Samurai Jack that pushes \u201csimplistic design\u201d and \u201cfight scene staging\u201d to an incredible zenith, and I\u2019ll put on \u201cSamurai vs. Ninja.\u201d It would take about fifty words to describe the visual trick of this episode, when you could just watch it and be amazed when you realize exactly how things are about to go down.\nJust watch it.\nThe Scotsman Saves Jack: Part I & II (S4: E6-7)\nFinally, Samurai Jack\u2019s only recurring secondary character gets his own two-parter. After finding an amnesiac Jack, the Scotsman sets out on a quest to find what caused his heroic friend\u2019s memory loss and cure it \u2014 all while defending a defenseless Jack from all of Aku\u2019s bounty hunters who still want to kill him.\nSeasons of Death (S4:E10)\n\u201cJack faces four different menaces on different seasons of the year,\u201d reads the Wikipedia description of this episode. It\u2019s a simple sentence that belies a masterfully crafted 22-minutes of television \u2014 an achievement recognized with the show\u2019s final (so far) Emmy. The four vignettes of \u201cSeasons of Death\u201d are each a full episode of Samurai Jack in microcosm. Each one is themed to a season of the year, each one shows Jack triumphing over an obstacle, and each subtly showcases a different aspect of Jack\u2019s heroism and the tonality of the show overall.\nTale of X9 (S4:E11)\n\u201cTale of X9\u201d is the only episode of Samurai Jack in which Jack is not the main character, and one of the most extreme breaks in structure the show has ever done (and two episodes before it would end, no less).\nIt\u2019s a narration-heavy noir detective story set in the Samurai Jack universe, where our \u201cSam Spade\u201d is a robot detective named X9 who is blackmailed out of retirement by Aku for one last hit.\nThink of this as the Brick of Samurai Jack. What happens to a Samurai Jack story when the assassin trying to kill Jack is our hero? I won\u2019t spoil the ending.\nJack and the Baby (S4:E13)\nIf you\u2019re expecting the final episode of Samurai Jack\u2019s fourth season to be something of significance to its overall story, reign in those assumptions. \u201cJack and the Baby\u201d is simple: Jack has to take care of a baby. The beating heart of this episode is Jack retelling the story of the Japanese folk hero Momotar\u014d, but it doesn\u2019t really come together as a whole until the punchline of its final moment."

      "text": "Genndy Tartakovsky is an animator\u2019s animator. Over the course of 30 years, the Russian-American animator and director has amassed a career of enviable accolades and creative success, from working on such shows as The Powerpuff Girls and Batman: The Animated Series to his immensely popular original series in the case of Dexter\u2019s Laboratory, Samurai Jack, and Star Wars: The Clone Wars.\nHis latest series Primal is arguably his most audacious yet. In the pulp adventure, a mute caveman known as \u201cSpear\u201d forms an unlikely bond with a Tyrannosaurus known as \u201cFang\u201d while surviving in a fantastical prehistoric world filled with deadly creatures. Season 1, which wrapped last November, earned Tartakovsky a nomination for the 2021 Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program.\nAhead of this year\u2019s Emmy Awards voting, which ends on Monday Aug. 30, Polygon spoke with Tartakovsky on his inspirations for creating Primal and what he hopes to achieve through the series\u2019 forthcoming second season.\n[Ed. note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.]\nThe first season of Primal feels like a big experiment; it\u2019s 10 episodes of predominantly non-dialogue-driven action and character development. What did you learn from the creation of season 1, and how are you going harder or changing things up in season 2?\nFor us, the first 10 episodes are what we think of as one season. But the second five episodes, once we got through the first five and we were seeing the episodes come to life, we started to realize we could do stories that were more complex. When you\u2019re doing episodes with no dialogue you\u2019re like, How much can we really get across story-wise? And then we realized there was a lot that we could do. So for the second five, we started to really mess around with more complex stories, especially in the \u201cCoven of the Damned\u201d episode, where we have the flashbacks to everyone\u2019s origins and this really complex emotional thing of the babies and the loss and the death. It was really fun to tell stories that way. We never intended for the show to be a \u201cMonster of the Week\u201d-type show.\nYou\u2019ve said Robert Howard\u2019s Conan the Barbarian series and the paintings of Frank Frazetta were key inspirations for the look and feel of Primal\u2019s first season. What art and stories are inspiring the series\u2019 second season?\nThe second season is \u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a departure, but it is an evolution of what we did in the first season. It feels the same, I think, but it\u2019s completely different in a way where there\u2019s just more emotion, more complex storytelling, but still very simple in that there\u2019s still either no dialogue or very sparse dialogue like we had in the first season.\nWhat I got from Robert Howard\u2019s Conan books and his other writing is, he was a pulp writer in the \u201920s. Those were always short stories; he trimmed the fat, there\u2019s no novel-like exposition of things. They usually start with Conan, he\u2019s in the desert with some girl, and they come upon a creature and they have to fight their way out. Those stories really connected with me because we make cartoons, right? So usually they\u2019re short. Reading Howard\u2019s work really connected with me because of his terse approach to storytelling because this is so much of what we do as animators, but with an emphasis on visuals and no dialogue.\nSo for the second season, we wanted more; we want it to evolve. We didn\u2019t want to just do 10 more minor variations on the first season. This genre has been done so much. I wanted to do something different and push the genre out of the clich\u00e9s associated with it as much as we could. And the second season is pushing out of the clich\u00e9. It\u2019s really exciting because I haven\u2019t really done anything like this. I\u2019m not going to give anything away, because the more of a surprise it is, the more fun it\u2019s going to be to watch. But we pushed ourselves story-wise to be more unconventional.\nWhat sort of clich\u00e9s do you see season 2 of Primal explicitly pushing against?\nIt\u2019s gonna be a little hard without giving anything away [laughter]. But let\u2019s see \u2026 if we were to elevate Primal into a barbarian adventure, or a sword-and-sorcery-type story, it could live in that world but still get away from clich\u00e9s, I think. Whenever you think of Stargate or 10,000 BC, the stories often gravitate to some kind of overlord scenario, some villain with thousands of slaves and that type of thing. I think in my very, very first development of the story of Primal, I had something like that. With a Pharaoh type of situation, but I quickly got away from it. It\u2019s sort of like, you take everything from this genre and we had a tendency to go there, because it feels natural. But then you start to think about all the things that have been done in this genre, and you\u2019re like No, we\u2019re just rehashing and doing it in our way, we have to come up with something more unique. That\u2019s as much as I can say at the moment though, it\u2019s really hard to say anything more without giving everything away.\nBased on what happens at the end of season 1 and where you\u2019re going in season 2, what do you hope to say through the story of Primal? What are the overarching themes you want to convey to the audience?\nI think it\u2019s always been survival and evolution. The surviving part is easy, right? You just want to live. But the evolution part is complex. And even more so without dialogue, without pontificating in a scene where Spear is sitting down and just saying, \u201cWhat is my place in the world?\u201d\nHow do you do that visually? That was the thing we most wanted to do. It\u2019s always been about that to a degree, Spear\u2019s evolution as a character. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on and that\u2019s what I wanted to say. At the end of the day, you have these 20 episodes, and what you see there is an evolution.\nPrimal season 1 is available to stream on HBO Max."

      "text": "Fifteen years after Emmy-winning Samurai Jack, Primal, and Star Wars: Clone Wars creator Genndy Tartakovsky sold his raunchy animated comedy Fixed to Sony, the movie will finally be released on Netflix on Aug. 13. The long journey to make the film, which Tartakovsky describes as an R-rated version of Lady and the Tramp, involved changing production studios \u2014 and fighting for the prominence of his canine characters\u2019 genitals.\nFixed was produced by Sony Pictures Animation, where Tartakovsky completed the work in 2023. Warner Bros.\u2019 New Line Cinema was scheduled to release it theatrically in 2024, but Warner Bros. Discovery shelved it as part of the same cost-cutting wave that stopped the releases of Coyote vs. Acme and The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie. Tartakovsky pitched Fixed around to other distributors, and he says John Derderian, Netflix\u2019s vice president of animation series, saw the film and loved it.\n\u201cI think you always need a champion in these kinds of instances,\u201d Tartakovsky told Polygon via video call. \u201cIf you look at streaming, Fox, or Adult Swim, adult animation is probably the most successful it\u2019s ever been. But that hasn't translated over into theatrical. Because [mainstream adult animation in America is] new, everybody\u2019s kind of unsure of how to take the risk. I think the audience that would watch it on TV would watch it theatrically, but I don\u2019t have the focus groups or testing to back it up.\u201d\nThe R-rated film follows Bull (Adam DeVine of The Righteous Gemstones), a mutt who learns he\u2019s scheduled to be neutered, and decides he needs one last wild night out with his best friends.\n\u201cHe has kind of a false sense of security about his balls, like Samson and his hair, like it\u2019s what makes [him] funny,\u201d Tartakovsky said. \u201cHis friends have been neutered, and they\u2019re just normal, but if I was going to get that surgery, I\u2019d be pretty freaked out about it too.\u201d\nBecause Bull\u2019s testicles are so important to the plot, they\u2019re also pretty visible in the film, which Tartakovsky said he had to fight for.\n\u201cMy theory is that it\u2019s going to be a little shocking in the beginning, but then you get used to it, like going to a nude beach,\u201d he said.\nTartakovsky did have to tone down the genital animation a bit, along with how the dogs\u2019 rectums are depicted.\n\u201cAfter our first test screening, we had a very serious discussion about it,\u201d Tartakovsky said. \u201cOur butthole is just a circle with a little X in it, or an asterisk, not drawn like a disgusting anus or anything. It\u2019s like in real life, where the dog\u2019s tails are up and you see the butt. So we colored them a bit more subtly, so you wouldn\u2019t have a dark butthole on a white dog.\u201d\nThe stylized, over-the-top animation is reminiscent of John Kricfalusi\u2019s The Ren & Stimpy Show and its many stylistic followers. Tartakovsky says he\u2019s a fan of that series, but any similarity between Kricfalusi\u2019s work and Fixed goes back to the inspirations he and Kricfalusi share: classic Warner Bros. cartoons and characters, including Popeye and Tom & Jerry. Tartakovsky assembled a team of animators from around the world to mesh that Warner Bros. look with the work of Tex Avery, who helped create core Looney Tunes characters like Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd. Tartakovsky\u2019s childhood favorites included Avery\u2019s deadpan basset hound Droopy, and his 1950 short Ventriloquist Cat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the styles that I trained in when I was first starting out, and that I love to do,\u201d Tartakovsky said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have big googly-eyed takes or anything like that. It\u2019s much more controlled. And it\u2019s a very different language, because our dogs walk like dogs. I didn\u2019t want hand gestures. I didn\u2019t want to make a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.\u201d\nBeneath the adult humor, Fixed is a love story about Bull finding the courage to share his feelings for Honey (Agatha All Along star Kathryn Hahn), the beautiful show dog next door.\n\u201cShe\u2019s like twice as tall as him, so he doesn\u2019t think he could get her,\u201d Tartakovsky said. \u201cHe thinks they\u2019re just friends. It\u2019s kind of heartfelt. This movie has raunchiness, really funny characters, and great hand-drawn animation. I think it\u2019s really unique, and I\u2019m excited for it to get out there.\u201d\nFixed will debut on Netflix Aug. 13."
