      "summary": "CaliberCos Inc (NASDAQ:CWD) reported a significant reduction in its platform adjusted loss to $54,000 in Q2 2025, down from $2.5 million in Q2 2024, attributed to cost-saving initiatives. The company has entered a development rights agreement with Hyatt to develop 15 new hotels and has seen a 6% increase in managed capital, reaching $498 million. However, it faces challenges such as an impairment charge of $2.3 million and delays in securing construction loans, while a potential lower interest rate environment could improve financing capabilities and enhance performance allocations.",
