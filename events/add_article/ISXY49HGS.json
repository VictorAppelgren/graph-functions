      "summary": "Five envelopes containing boric acid and menacing notes were found in the mailroom of 26 Federal Plaza, the Manhattan ICE field office, prompting a swift evacuation and a joint response by FDNY, NYPD, FBI and federal partners.  The letters threatened ICE employees with “karma” and referenced an Anthrax song, but preliminary tests confirmed no hazardous toxins were present.  ICE officials thanked responders and reiterated their commitment to national security while the FBI’s Quantico lab continues the investigation.  The incident follows a federal judge’s order to improve conditions at the ICE holding facility, including a ban on toothbrushes, amid ongoing scrutiny of the agency’s detention practices.",
