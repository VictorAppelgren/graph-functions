  "title": "Match Point: How To Serve The Honey Deuce At Home",
  "description": "Learn how to make the official drink of the U.S. Open, the Honey Deuce, taste just as good at home as it does courtside with these easy to follow tips and tricks.",
  "content": "Every year at the end of August, before Summer nights fade into Fall, the U.S. Open takes over the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center grounds in Queens, New York. And so does the Honey Deuce, the official cocktail of the U.S. Open.\n\nThe drink debuted at the 2006 U.S. Open when Grey Goose became a sponsor and in recent years the sipper has catapulted to its own form of celebrity. Everyone and anyone at the U.S. Open wouldn\u2019t dare leave without posing with their Grey Goose Honey Deuce.\n\nCan\u2019t snag a ticket to the U.S. Open this year? No problem \u2014 you can still sip like you\u2019re courtside. Molly Horn, chief mixologist and spirits educator at Total Wine & More offered up tips for making the best version of this signature cocktail at home, whether you\u2019re toasting solo during a nail-biter match or serving a crowd at your own Grand Slam watch party.\n\nThere is something so special about the Honey Deuce at the U.S. Open; so much so that it may not feel the same drinking from home. Do you have any tips, tricks or hacks for ensuring it still tastes awesome even when making it yourself?\n\nHorn: I would imagine for most home bartenders the challenge is the honeydew melon balls. There are plenty of great, quality lemonades on the market if you can\u2019t make it fresh yourself, and Chambord and Baron De Casterac are great (black) raspberry liqueurs \u2014 another option if you want a straight raspberry liqueur is Drillaud.\n\nFor those honeydew balls, I would recommend getting a melon baller \u2014 which will make the process much faster and easier \u2014 and attacking the whole melon. If you haven\u2019t done this before, it\u2019s actually super easy, but having the right tool will make all the difference.\n\nIf you do you want to make lemonade yourself, the key is to use fresh lemon juice and whisk it together aggressively with equal amounts of granulated sugar \u2014 the lemon juice will break down and dissolve the sugar much better than adding it to water alone first \u2014 then add your filtered water. I prefer a ratio of one part lemon juice, one part sugar, and four parts water for a nice and brightly tangy lemonade, but if that\u2019s too sweet or sour for you you can always adjust \u2014 just do so before you add it to the cocktail.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most common mistake people make when trying to recreate the Honey Deuce at home?\n\nHorn: A majority of the challenges I see for the home mixologist with this cocktail is using a shelf-stable lemonade that doesn\u2019t have the zip or tang of a fresh lemonade. Since that is the foundation of the cocktail, it\u2019s really important to either purchase fresh lemonade (from the refrigerated section of your shop or market, with a sell-by date within one to two weeks) or make it yourself.\n\nCan you talk through batching this cocktail and what that looks like?\n\nHorn: This is a great recipe for batching since it doesn\u2019t require any dilution (aka, it doesn\u2019t get shaken or stirred, just poured together). My biggest tip, as always, is just to make sure all of your ingredients are very cold (vodka in the freezer, other ingredients in the fridge for 24 hours+ before serving) in order to minimize over-dilution of your batch. I also recommend freezing melon balls overnight \u2014 not only will they work better to keep your batched cocktail nice and chilled, but they won\u2019t melt and over-dilute the way ice cubes would.\n\nGlassware and ice are also so important to this drink \u2014 what do you suggest?\n\nHorn: I like to serve it in a tall glass, like a Collins or a Highball. I personally prefer to freeze the honeydew balls and use those for \u2018ice\u2019 (since I also have my ingredients for the cocktail chilled in advance), but if you want to go for real ice it would look and taste great with a highball ice cube. You can find ice trays that make four long, wide, ice cubes that will fill up the length of your glass, keep your cocktail nice and cold, and take a long time to melt \u2014 allowing you to enjoy it at your leisure.\n\nAre there any other spins on this cocktail that could make it a bit more unique, while keeping the essence?\n\nHorn: This recipe is a great one for riffing \u2014 for one thing, using a sparkling lemonade adds a great effervescence I really enjoy. Elderflower plays nicely with the flavors in the cocktail, so adding a splash of elderflower liqueur or syrup is a really nice addition. And of course, many different fruit liqueurs will work great in place of raspberry if you want to switch it up, such as Drillaud Strawberry Liqueur or any of the Chinola flavors \u2014 which would also add a nice texture \u2014 especially passion fruit or pineapple.",
