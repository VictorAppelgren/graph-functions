  "description": "Terraform co-founder Do Kwon has pleaded guilty to two US chargers of fraud after his actions wiped out $40 billion worth of crypto investments.",
  "content": "Terraform co-founder Do Kwon has pleaded guilty to two US chargers of fraud after his actions wiped out $40 billion worth of crypto investments, The Guardian reported. Kwon's story is a wild one involving an immense crypto crash, an Interpol manhunt and Kwon's eventual extradition from Montenegro to the United States.\n\nKwon, along with Sam Bankman-Fried and others, was a key player in 2022's crypto collapse. His company Terraform created a \"stablecoin\" called TerraUSD supposedly pegged to the US dollar, along with a floating crypto coin called Luna. When TerraUSD fell below its $1 peg in May of 2021, Kwon secretly arranged for a trading firm to buy the currency to boost its price. However, he lied to investors and said he stabilized the coin using a specialized algorithm.\n\nThose investors believed the story and bought up Luna (closely tied to TerraUSD), to the tune of nearly $50 billion, according to US prosecutors. Both currencies subsequently collapsed, taking $40 billion of investor money with it. As it often works with such things, many regular people lost their life savings, while venture capital firms profited before the rug was pulled.\n\nFollowing the collapse, Kwon was put on wanted lists in both the US and South Korea, with investigators in the latter country enlisting Interpol to find the entrepreneur. He subsequently posted on X that he \"wasn't on the run\" and was extradited to the US last year on New Year's Eve.\n\nKwon was originally charged with nine counts including securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and money-laundering conspiracy. Though facing up to 25 years, he may receive a reduced sentence of 12 years maximum provided he accepts responsibility for his crimes. \"I made false and misleading statements about why [TerraUSD] regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm\u2019s role in restoring that peg,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cWhat I did was wrong.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Kwon agreed to pay an $80 million civil fine and be banned from crypto transactions as part of a $4.55 billion US Securities and Exchange Commission settlement. Prosecutors will allow Kwon to be transferred to South Korea after half his US sentence is served.",

      "text": "2022 was the year crypto came crashing down to Earth\nThere's an expression crypto enthusiasts use, with fingers crossed, in the hopes a particular digital currency's value will blast off: \"To the moon!\"\nMuch of crypto did graze the stratosphere at the start of 2022, when enthusiasm was astronomically high, but a few months later it all came crashing back down to Earth.\nBitcoin's value is roughly a fourth of what it was a year ago, and the industry is just starting to grapple with the fallout from the catastrophic implosion of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\nIn the future, 2022 may be regarded as a turning point for the world of virtual currencies, when they lost their luster and were cast out as a fringe product most people approach with skepticism and caution. Or it may simply be remembered as a stretch of excruciating growing pains for an industry still in its infancy.\nRegardless, 2022 was one for the crypto history books.\nHow it started\nThe ads were everywhere \u2014 on TV, on bus stops, and even in fortune cookies. Crypto companies spent tens of millions of dollars on marketing, swamping the Super Bowl with commercials. The currencies and tokens may have been virtual, but crypto became more real for many Americans in the early months of the year.\nThe industry seemed to reach \"peak hype\" in January and February, says Molly White, a fellow at Harvard University who is a crypto skeptic. She runs the site Web3 is Going Just Great.\n\"Prices had hit all-time highs,\" she says. \"People were making irrational amounts of money.\"\nThe value of the most famous cryptocurrency \u2014 bitcoin \u2014 had just set a record, and the industry was trying to \"mainstream itself,\" as White puts it. Meaning, crypto companies were doing all they could to bring in more customers.\nA woman better known for setting fashion trends than financial ones, Paris Hilton, appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in January. After talking about her recent marriage and trip to Burning Man, the former reality TV star went deep on the NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, she was hawking.\nThe audience seemed a bit perplexed when she promised, Oprah-style, to give each of them an NFT \u2014 another kind of digital asset that is basically cartoony crypto art. But when Fallon, who is himself an NFT enthusiast, seemed blown away, they applauded.\n\"Peak hype,\" though, crested quickly.\nHow it's going\nLike just about everything else in finance, crypto saw its prices tank when the Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates to fight high inflation.\nThat shocked many of bitcoin's biggest backers, many of whom believed the virtual currency would be an inflation hedge, like gold. They had predicted bitcoin's value would rise during a period of high inflation; instead, it was falling.\nWhat's called a \"crypto winter\" \u2014 a downturn that has gone on and on \u2014 began before 2022 even reached its halfway point.\n\"You know, we've been living in the 'crypto winter' for the better part of a year,\" says Lee Reiners, who teaches cryptocurrency law at Duke University.\nIndividual investors have been hurt, especially people who bought digital assets near the highs. But according to Reiners, the crypto winter also revealed larger, systemic problems in the industry.\n\"It really exposed a number of crypto firms who were, you know, overextended, had poor risk management, or otherwise were engaging in fraudulent activity,\" he says.\nA string of failures started in May: a pair of cryptocurrencies called Terra and Luna, the trading platform Voyager, a crypto hedge fund called Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, Celsius ...\nThe list goes on and on, and according to Reiners, it highlights something troublesome about crypto.\n\"These firms are deeply interconnected, and so, the moment you kind of have one problem somewhere in the crypto sector, it spreads very, very quickly,\" he says.\nFinancial regulators started to crack down, as well. They even went after another big-name celebrity for how she touted \"EMAX tokens.\" None other than Kim Kardashian had to settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission in October for more than $1 million.\nAnd what's next\nWhich brings us to FTX.\nAt the start of 2022, the crypto company was valued at $32 billion. Now, it's bankrupt, more than a million people are worried the money they put into it has vanished, and the company's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been charged with criminal fraud.\nBankman-Fried cultivated an image that made him memorable and seemingly accessible, with wild hair and a penchant for wearing shorts and T-shirts. His goal was to get more everyday people to buy crypto and more conventional Wall Street firms and funds to invest in it.\nThe 30-year-old was so successful at bringing crypto to the masses that he was considered the industry's unofficial spokesman. He's currently under house arrest at his parents' home in Palo Alto, Calif.\nReiners calls the swift and total collapse of FTX \"the biggest event in crypto's history\" \u2014 a history, he adds, that's \"replete with a lot of failures and scams and frauds and hacks.\"\nNow, people are wondering what could be the next domino to fall.\nBinance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, and after several big waves of panic-driven withdrawals, it looks like it has the potential to be that domino.\nBut the company is pushing back against fears and crypto skepticism, more generally. It has to, said White.\n\"If people start to question the industry as a whole, or crypto as an asset class, that is devastating for Binance,\" she says. \"So, they are doing anything they can to prevent that from happening.\"\nFor many, it's disorienting to see how quickly crypto's fortunes reversed, and they are struggling to gauge the depth of the damage from FTX.\n\"I think crypto would be lucky if all they were set back [was] by a couple of years,\" White says.\nTrue believers expect bitcoin will bounce back and this \"crypto winter\" will thaw eventually.\nBut for people who weren't deep into crypto \u2014 who maybe saw an ad or who were driven by a fear of missing out to dabble in buying tokens \u2014 it's a different story, especially with daily revelations from Bankman-Fried's former co-workers about how customer money was allegedly moved out of FTX and into their own pockets.\n\"I think people are starting to think of crypto as this big scam that they would not want anything to do with,\" White says.\nAnd that poses an existential problem for crypto, she adds. Because, for it to work, it requires an ever-larger stream of people to keep buying it."

      "text": "- Two major cryptocurrencies, TerraUSD and LUNA, crashed dramatically in the past week.\n- Insider spoke with three investors who lost thousands of dollars as the coins imploded.\n- Corey, who told Insider he's on disability because of a work accident, said he's lost over $30,000.\nThe crypto market witnessed one of its most striking breakdowns this month as TerraUSD, one of the biggest algorithmic stablecoins, fell apart. The cryptocoin dropped from its intended value of one US dollar to currently hover around ten cents, leading to buyers suffering devastating losses.\nOriginally created in 2018 by the 30-year-old Do Kwon, TerraUSD \u2013 often abbreviated as UST \u2013 was meant to be perpetually pegged to the value of one US dollar and offer stability. TerraUSD was paired with another coin, LUNA, which it could be exchanged for and had a price that could fluctuate. When the balance between these two coins became unstable in recent weeks, investors panicked and the equivalent of a bank run on the cryptocurrencies caused UST to lose over 90% of its value and LUNA went from around $80 one month ago to worth less than a cent this week.\nAs the TerraUSD project imploded and other cryptocurrencies saw downturns \u2013 Bitcoin has lost around half of its value in the past six month \u2013 investors who bought into the idea of reaping huge profits or finding stability in UST have faced the realities of a volatile market and sudden financial disaster.\nInsider spoke with three people, who requested their full names not be used because of privacy concerns, who lost thousands of dollars in the crypto crash. They shared how the saga has impacted their lives.\nCorey, a 37-year-old from Canada, told Insider he originally got into LUNA in November 2021 after searching through reviews and reading Reddit comments.\n\"It appeared to me to be an incredible project,\" Corey said.\nHe's now lost over $30,000 since the nosedive began, he told Insider. While he still has a little over $1,000 in profits from other investments like Reddit-favorite GameStop, his world has been rocked by the sudden crisis. He used to be employed doing both auto-manufacturing and industrial flat-roofing jobs, he said, but turned to crypto after getting injured and now has trouble walking.\n\"I'm on disability because I was in a major work accident, someone didn't properly install temp stairs and they failed,\" Corey said. \"So as you can imagine, I'm devastated.\"\nAs the coin dropped, the main subreddit for UST and LUNA, r/terraluna, was overloaded with investors speculating on what happened and mourning their losses. Some users who claimed to have poured tens of thousands of dollars into the coin said they didn't know how they would recover and mentioned self-harm. Others lashed out at Kwon, who previously derided critics who expressed concern about the stablecoin on social media. Amid the chaos, the subreddit was locked against new posts last week.\nThe severity of the losses varies from people who claim to have lost millions to others who had only dipped into crypto more recently out of curiosity. A 21-year-old Computer Science student from Slovenia told Insider he got involved with UST at the start of April. It was his first crypto investment and he was hoping to buy an electric car with the money, he wrote in a Reddit comment. The crash means that's no longer possible and he's lost $2,200, he said.\nOthers in the Reddit forum posted that the token's loss of value would have serious ramifications not just for themselves, but their families as well.\nJen, a 34-year-old teacher, told Insider she got into crypto and LUNA a little over a year ago after hearing about it from her brother. She initially invested $1,000 and then added more every month or so, she said. She also holds other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\n\"I truly believed it was a solid project,\" Jen said of LUNA. \"Did my research and got involved in the community.\"\nBut when LUNA crashed, she said she lost over $17,000. Jen wrote in a Reddit post last week that if she had cashed out when LUNA was worth $100, which was around early April, she would've collected over $25,000. She wanted a downpayment on a house, she wrote, and had gotten greedy.\nThe collapse has now dashed her hopes of buying a home for herself and her children.\n\"We are currently renting an apartment and hoping to be able to afford sky high prices of houses here in the US,\" she said. \"But I guess with the money gone, no house for us and have to get by with what is left.\""

      "text": "Do Kwon, the South Korean entrepreneur behind two cryptocurrencies that lost an estimated $40bn in 2022 and caused the market to implode, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two US charges of conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud.\nKwon, 33, who co-founded Singapore-based Terraform Labs and developed the TerraUSD and Luna currencies, entered the plea at a federal court hearing in New York. He had pleaded not guilty in January to a nine-count indictment charging him with securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and money-laundering conspiracy.\nAccused of misleading investors in 2021 about TerraUSD \u2013 a so-called stablecoin designed to maintain a value of $1 \u2013 Kwon pleaded guilty to the two counts under an agreement with the Manhattan US attorney\u2019s office, which brought the charges.\nHe faces up to 25 years in prison when Engelmayer sentences him on 11 December, though prosecutor Kimberly Ravener said the government had agreed to advocate for a prison term of no more than 12 years, provided he accepts responsibility for his crimes. He has been detained since his extradition from Montenegro late last year.\nKwon is one of several cryptocurrency moguls to face federal charges after a slump in digital token prices in 2022 prompted the collapse of a number of companies. Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the US\u2019s largest crypto exchange, FTX, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2024.\nProsecutors alleged that when TerraUSD slipped below its $1 peg in May 2021, Kwon told investors a computer algorithm known as \u201cTerra Protocol\u201d had restored the coin\u2019s value. Instead, they said, he arranged for a high-frequency trading firm to secretly buy millions of dollars of the token to artificially prop up its price.\nProsecutors said that false claim and others drove retail and institutional investors to buy Terraform products and boost the value of Luna \u2013 a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD \u2013 to $50bn by the spring of 2022.\nIn court, Kwon apologized for his conduct.\n\u201cI made false and misleading statements about why it regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm\u2019s role in restoring that peg,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cWhat I did was wrong.\u201d\nKwon agreed in 2024 to pay $80m as a civil fine and be banned from crypto transactions as part of a $4.55bn settlement he and Terraform reached with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\nHe also faces charges in South Korea. As part of the deal, prosecutors will not oppose Kwon\u2019s potential application to be transferred abroad after serving half his US sentence, Ravener said."

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In May, the collapse of one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin projects cost investors tens of billions of dollars as they pulled out in a panic that some have compared to a bank run. But before that, the stablecoin known as terraUSD (or UST, for short) and its sister token luna, had experienced a pretty spectacular run-up \u2014 and some investors made a killing before it all collapsed.\nVenture capital firm Pantera Capital tells CNBC it earned a 100-fold return on its $1.7 million investment in luna. Hack VC and the Winklevoss-backed CMCC Global didn't share their exact gains, but CMCC told CNBC that it closed its luna position in March, while Hack reportedly got out in December.\nThe scheme relied largely on faith and the promise of future returns, plus a complex set of code, with very little hard cash to back up the whole arrangement.\nUnlike USDC (another popular dollar-pegged stablecoin), which has fiat assets in reserve as a way to back their tokens, UST was an algorithmic stablecoin created and administered by Singapore-based Terraform Labs. It depended on computer code to self-stabilize its value by creating and destroying UST and luna in a sort of supply-and-demand seesaw effect.\nFor a while, it worked.\nUST held its dollar peg and the luna token soared. The luna token rose to more than $116 in April, up more than 135% in less than two months. Traders were able to arbitrage the system and profit from deviations in the price of the two tokens. But perhaps the greatest incentive of the entire scheme was an accompanying lending platform, called Anchor, which promised investors a 20% annual percentage yield on their UST holdings \u2014 a rate many analysts said was unsustainable.\nWidespread buy-in \u2014 and public PSAs \u2014 from respected financial institutions lent credibility to the project, further driving the narrative that the whole thing was legit.\nMost everyone was happy until it all came crashing down in early May.\nAlthough the project had amassed about $3 billion worth of bitcoin in its reserves as a backstop for UST, when the price of luna became unstable, investors rushed out of both tokens, sending prices off a cliff. The Luna Foundation Guard tried to restore UST's $1 peg by spending almost all of the bitcoin in its reserve. It didn't work.\nAt their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless.\nThe entire episode has laid bare the advantages of experienced large-scale investors over retail investors gambling on hope.\nOne person posted on Reddit that they didn't think they would have enough money to pay for their next semester at school after losing money on luna and UST. Another investor affected by the crash tweeted that she and her husband sold their house and bet it all on luna, noting that she was still trying to digest whether it was actually happening or just a nightmare.\nOthers are contemplating suicide after losing all they've got.\n\"I'm lost, about to commit suicide in a chair,\" one commenter posted to Reddit. \"I lost my life savings in the investments of (LUNA UST) the worst thing is that 3 weeks ago I proposed to my girlfriend. She doesn't know anything, I lost 62 thousand dollars. I'm here I don't know what to do.\"\nWho cashed out, and why\nAmong the winners of the UST flash crash are Pantera Capital, a hedge fund that saw a 100x return on its investment.\nJoey Krug, the fund's co-chief investment officer, told CNBC that in the primary fund where they held and traded luna, they sold about 87% of their position from Jan. 2021 through Apr. 2022. Pantera then sold another 8% in May once it was clear the UST peg had broken. At the end of it all, Krug says that Pantera \"got stuck\" with about 5% of their position.\nAll that liquidation translated to a return of $171 million on a $1.7 million initial investment, assuming the remaining luna they own continue to be worth nothing.\nEven as the fund was selling, Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead joined CNBC in Dec. 2021 to talk about his top altcoin picks, which included the Terra blockchain's luna token. At the time, luna was up more than 15,800% in 2021.\n\"We think it's one of the most promising coins for the coming year,\" Morehead said of luna. \"So many people are just discovering it and just starting to trade it.\"\nBut Krug says the firm's initial decision to liquidate came down to risk management and rebalancing the fund.\n\"For the large portion which we sold over 2021 and part of 2022, it was a really simple risk management reason,\" said Krug. \"It kept becoming a larger and larger part of the fund and so we had to de-risk it since you can't really run a liquid hedge fund with one position being a super large portion of the fund.\"\nWhen Pantera noticed the UST $1 peg breaking in May, it sold again.\n\"It was really just seeing the peg break by a few cents and pattern matching it to historical currency pegs,\" continued Krug, who noted that generally when a currency breaks peg, it gets hammered. Even though the firm owned a bunch of luna as opposed to UST, when UST trades under its peg, the dynamic is such that more luna is minted, lowering the value of each coin overall.\n\"So basically, you want to sell it so you don't end up getting diluted,\" explained Krug.\nHong Kong-based venture firm CMCC Global was one of Terraform's first seed investors back in early 2018.\nCMCC Founder Martin Baumann tells CNBC it divested its stake in March because of concerns resulting from ongoing due diligence. The decision to sell was partly to do with the tech behind UST, but his chief concern had more to do with regulation.\n\"As opposed to asset backed stablecoins, which are derivatives of existing USD in circulation, UST was effectively increasing the money supply of USD in existence,\" a job that Baumann notes is reserved for the Federal Reserve.\n\"We figured, while an interesting concept, regulators would not tolerate tampering with money supply of the USD,\" continued Baumann.\nThe rapid growth of UST accelerated CMCC's concerns.\nWhen CMCC sold, the luna token was trading at about $100. When asked about the profit on that sale, Baumann said the firm does not comment on returns or performance of individual investments.\nCrypto-centric venture fund Hack VC reportedly exited its Luna stake in December.\nCNBC reached out to Hack VC partner Rodney Yesep, but he didn't respond to our request for comment on the profitability of that sale. Yesep did say in a recent interview on the DeFi Decoded Podcast that they were seed investors in Terra from \"back in the day\" when it was \"like a different entity.\"\n\"It sucks to see a bunch of people get impacted by this sort of stuff,\" Yesep said in the podcast. \"We were no longer holding a position by the time the downturn happened, but a lot of people were, and a lot of people were pretty impacted.\"\nThen there's Galaxy Digital, the crypto merchant bank founded by billionaire investor Mike Novogratz.\nIn a public letter addressed to \"shareholders, friends, partners, and the crypto community,\" Novogratz \u2014 who got a luna tattoo on his arm to memorialize his status as an official 'Lunatic' \u2014 opined on where the project went wrong, but also noted that Galaxy took profits along the way.\nIn its Q1 earnings filing, Galaxy noted that the largest contributor to its net realized gain on digital assets of $355 million was sales of luna.\nOther major backers of Terraform Labs included some of the biggest names in venture capital, including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Coinbase Ventures. Three Arrows Capital and Jump Crypto bought into the luna token. CNBC has not learned how these firms fared.\nA road to redemption?\nTerra's backers have voted to revive the failed venture. The proposed re-build involves a new Terra blockchain and getting rid of the beleaguered stablecoin that helped trigger the meltdown of the original project. It could also mean redemption for the institutional and retail investors who got wiped out.\nFor those who saw a big loss, the re-launch could potentially translate into an opportunity to recoup losses on initial investments.\nDelphi Digital, for example, has disclosed that it it is \"currently sitting on a large unrealized loss\" after miscalculating the risk of a death spiral event coming to fruition, and Coindesk reporting shows that Seoul-based Hashed Ventures has lost over $3.5 billion.\nThe terra 2.0 proposal includes a plan to distribute tokens to holders of the old luna (soon to be renamed \"luna classic\") and UST tokens. If the rebranded coins take off, that could be a form of redemption for investors who suffered a loss.\nBut for those who got out before things went south for UST, they are steering clear.\n\"With the new chain, it looks like a good chunk of the airdropped tokens will be vested over a number of years,\" Pantera Capital's Krug told CNBC. \"We have projects in our portfolio which have integrations with Terra. I'd love to see something community driven succeed here, but we're a fairly chain-agnostic fund.\"\nCMCC Global's Baumann said the fund has decided not to make new investments into the revived terra ecosystem at this time.\nDays before the UST collapse, Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon \u2014 who has bragged that he doesn't \"debate the poor\" \u2014 said in an interview that 95% of coins would \"die\" but there is \"entertainment in watching companies die, too.\""

      "text": "Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon will face securities fraud charges in the US\nKwon was extradited from Montenegro to the US.\nTerraforms Labs CEO Do Kwon spent the last day of 2024 getting extradited to the US, Reuters reports. Kwon faces charges in the US for \"orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud involving an algorithmic stablecoin and other crypto asset securities.\" The Terraforms co-founder has been held in Montenegro since March 2023, when he tried to board a flight with a forged passport \u2014 six months after Interpol put out a \"red notice\" warrant for his arrest.\nSouth Korean-based Terraforms Labs wiped out $40 billion from the crypto market when its TerraUSD and Luna stable coins turned out to not be so stable and collapsed in May 2022. Kwon had already fled South Korea the month before.\nThe US announced its charges in February 2023, with the SEC chair Gary Gensler stating, \"We allege that Terraform and Do Kwon failed to provide the public with full, fair, and truthful disclosure as required for a host of crypto asset securities, most notably for Luna and TerraUSD. We also allege that they committed fraud by repeating false and misleading statements to build trust before causing devastating losses for investors.\" South Korea has issued similar charges.\nMontenegro doesn't have extradition treaties with the US or South Korea. The request played out in court over the last year and a half, with Montenegro's Justice Minister Bojan Bozovic ordering Kwon's extradition last week. Terraform Labs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US last January."

      "text": "South Korean prosecutors ask Interpol for help in locating TerraUSD developer Do Kwon\nDo Kwon recently tweeted that he was not on the run, but authorities disagree.\nOver the weekend, Terraform Labs' CEO and co-founder Do Kwon took to Twitter to say that he was not \"on the run\" or \"anything similar.\" He made the statement after South Korean authorities issued an arrest warrant for him and five other people connected to Terraform Labs for violating the country's capital markets laws last week. But Korean prosecutors aren't convinced, especially since authorities in Singapore, where Kwon flew to back in April, said he was no longer in the country. Now, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office is asking the Interpol to place him in the agency's red notice list and to revoke his passport, according to The Financial Times.\nAccording to the Interpol's website, a red notice entails seeking \"the location and arrest of wanted persons wanted for prosecution or to serve a sentence\" and is commonly issued for fugitives. As Yonhap News notes, Kwon flew to Singapore in late April around the time he dissolved his company's office in Korea. His family members and other key Terraform Labs personnel reportedly followed him to the city-state in May.\nThe executive and other Terraform Labs' personnel are under investigation for financial fraud and tax evasion following the collapse of the company's stablecoins, TerraUSD and Luna. $40 billion of investor money was wiped out from the even. And those investors, who lost their life savings to the crash, filed complaints that accuse him of running a Ponzi scheme.\nProsecutors believe he left Korea to \"evade investigation,\" seeing as Kwon also apparently told them through his lawyers that he didn't intend to appear before them for questioning. A spokesperson for the Seoul prosecutors' office told The Times that they're doing their best to locate and arrest him. \"He is clearly on the run as his company\u2019s key finance people also left for the same country during that time,\" they added.\nKwon has yet to respond to the prosecutors enlisting the Interpol for help in finding him. On Twitter, his location is still set to Singapore, and his latest tweets were still from the weekend, denying that he was trying to avoid being captured by law enforcement."
