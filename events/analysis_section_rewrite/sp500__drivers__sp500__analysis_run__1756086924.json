      "feedback": "The draft has strong macro anchors (Fed policy, inflation regimes, crypto price anchors) and a coherent set of cross‑asset drivers, but it falters on a tight causal chain, uses some strained, under‑sourced narrative (notably the EURUSD/device‑tech language), and contains incomplete numbers and formatting glitches that undercut credibility; to elevate to world‑class, restructure into a single, explicit macro→flows→valuation chain grounded in first principles, fix incomplete numbers (e.g., “gross margin ≈ 4” should be 4%), and attach every factual claim to a source ID. Actionable edits: 1) rebuild the causal spine as a three‑regime framework (Regime A: disinflation with conditional easing; Regime B: inflation nearer target with measured easing; Regime C: growth slowdown boosting defensives), map each regime to discount rates, risk premia, and crypto valuations, and clearly show how transitions hinge on wage growth momentum, inflation persistence, and policy cues at Jackson Hole plus relevant capex cycles; 2) quantify probabilities and price anchors with explicit bands (e.g., ETH 4,000–5,000; BTC 110,000–125,000; 10Y yield path under each regime; RWA ~16T by 2030; tokenization ~$4.2B in 2025) and reconcile any conflicting numbers (correct the oil/flow figures and ensure consistency across regimes); 3) expand the scenario structure to base, upside, and downside with trigger thresholds and invalidation rules (e.g., CPI surprises >+0.2% MoM for two prints or wage growth accelerating beyond a target range; oil inventory surprises; semicapex cadence turning negative); 4) prune non‑essential or unclear passages (the EURUSD/AI device narrative and the Pixel‑device references) or reanchor them to explicit, sourced drivers if retained; 5) sharpen the watch‑list to 6 decisive signals with timing windows and probabilistic implications, linking each to a cited source (e.g., Y6SQOEK69, 15, 9; JPAIHPA4N; SGB2PAZGK; 22PL3Q360; OGK8WLL69); 6) fix typographical breakages (e.g., “und” truncation), ensure consistent units (gross margin 4%), and present the ACMR/Ford example with context (period, basis, and whether it supports EV/auto capex channels); 7) ensure every assertion has a source tag and that all critical sources are covered, with no new claims beyond the provided IDs; 8) deliver the revised narrative in SECTION FOCUS format (synthesize macro, policy, flows/positioning, valuation/technicals) and terminate with a crisp, numbered watch‑list of signals.",
