      "summary": "In 2023, only four percent of 16 and 17-year-olds entered employment after their GCSEs, with a notable increase in interest for Level 2 and 3 apprenticeships, reflecting a shift in career perspectives among young people. Factors such as rising university fees and competition are leading students to consider practical work options, including apprenticeships and vocational qualifications. Additionally, Virgin Media O2 has launched a £1 million apprenticeship levy fund to support small businesses and charities in training apprentices, particularly targeting underrepresented groups in STEM fields.",
