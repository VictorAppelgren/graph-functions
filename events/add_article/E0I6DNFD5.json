      "summary": "A Florida archaeology student, Yara Souza, uncovered a 9th‑century gold artifact near Dere Street in Northumberland, Britain, during her first excavation, sparking excitement about its possible religious or ceremonial use. The find follows other recent discoveries in the UK, including two 2,000‑year‑old Roman shoes unearthed by volunteers at Magna fort and a 1,900‑year‑old Roman coin hoard that equates to a legionary’s monthly pay. These artifacts highlight the continued richness of Britain’s Roman heritage and the ongoing interest in early medieval material culture.",
