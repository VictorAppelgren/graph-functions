      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mapping**  \n   - Add an explicit link to a canonical handle: `ust10y` (U.S. 10‑year Treasury yield).  \n   - Cite the source: `LF0UUL917`.\n\n2. **Catalyst Window & Timing**  \n   - Include the key catalyst: Fed’s pause on rate cuts in **September 2024**.  \n   - Add a brief note that the Fed’s balance‑sheet contraction (ongoing since Q3 2024) is a secondary catalyst.\n\n3. **Magnitude & Direction**  \n   - State a clear range: mortgage rates are **steady at 6.5–7.0 %** (≈ 5–10 bp above the 7‑month low).  \n   - Indicate potential movement: up 5–15 bp if inflation remains sticky; down 5–10 bp if Fed cuts again.\n\n4. **Causal Chain**  \n   - Explicitly connect:  \n     - Fed policy → 10‑yr Treasury yield → mortgage rates.  \n     - Inflation expectations & national debt → upward pressure.  \n     - Loan demand → liquidity constraints.\n\n5. **Risk / Invalidation**  \n   - Note that a **Fed rate cut** or a sharp **inflation decline** would invalidate the current “near‑7 %” regime.  \n   - Mention that a **surge in U.S. debt issuance** could push rates higher.\n\n6. **Action & Horizon**  \n   - Recommend: **monitor Fed policy meetings (Sept 2024 onward), CPI releases, and Treasury issuance schedules**.  \n   - Horizon: multi‑year structural view (2025‑2027).\n\n7. **Citation Density**  \n   - Add inline citations: `(LF0UUL917)` after each factual claim.  \n   - Add a footnote or bracketed reference for the Fed pause: `(Fed policy – September 2024)`.\n\n8. **Conciseness & Focus**  \n   - Trim any extraneous wording; keep the paragraph to 3–4 sentences.  \n   - Ensure every sentence ties back to the mortgage‑rate theme with a handle or catalyst.\n\n**Revised Draft (example)**  \n> U.S. 30‑year mortgage rates have stabilized near **6.5–7.0 %** (≈ 5–10 bp above the 7‑month low) as of Aug 27 2025, reflecting a structural regime where the Fed’s pause on rate cuts in **September 2024** and its ongoing balance‑sheet contraction jointly constrain downward pressure (LF0UUL917). The regime is driven by the Fed’s policy stance, inflation expectations, national debt, and loan demand, all of which feed into the 10‑yr Treasury yield (`ust10y`) that transmits to mortgage rates. A Fed rate cut or a sharp easing of inflation would invalidate the near‑7 % regime, while a surge in U.S. debt issuance could push rates higher. **Action:** monitor Fed policy meetings, CPI releases, and Treasury issuance schedules through 2025‑2027; **confidence:** moderate.",
