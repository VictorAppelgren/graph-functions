  "description": "The patriarch\u2019s entrepreneurial journey, which led him to amass a substantial fortune, was a remarkable one.

  "content": "Goh Cheng Liang\u2014the founder of Wuthelam Group, the controlling shareholder of Japan\u2019s Nippon Paint Holdings\u2014passed away peacefully on Tuesday morning at age 98, according to a statement from his family.\n\n\u201cMy father was a beacon of kindness and strength,\u201d Goh Hup Jin, his eldest son and chairman of Nippon Paint, said in the statement. \u201cWe are very fortunate to have had him show us how to be a good person. He taught us to live life with compassion and humility.\u201d\n\nThe patriarch\u2019s entrepreneurial journey, which led him to amass a substantial fortune, was a remarkable one. The self-made billionaire grew up in humble circumstances, living in a shophouse on River Valley Road with his parents and four siblings. At the time of his death his real-time net worth was just over $13 billion, the bulk of which was derived from a controlling stake in Japan\u2019s Nippon Paint, according to Forbes\u2019 estimates.\n\nThe one-time fishnet seller and rubber tapper stumbled into the paints business after World War II, buying cheap paint from the British army that he turned into a local brand called Pigeon. In 1962, he jumped at the opportunity to partner with Nippon Paint, then looking to expand into Southeast Asia.\n\nOver nearly six decades, he expanded the business in the region and went on to acquire a stake in Nippon Paint, currently the world\u2019s fourth-largest paints company by sales. In 2021, his son Hup Jin led the family\u2019s Wuthelam group in cementing a $12 billion stock-and-cash deal that gave their privately held holding company control of Nippon Paint. The deal involved Wuthelam raising its stake in the Tokyo-listed company to close to 60% from 40%; in return, Nippon Paint bought out their Asian joint ventures, including Wuthelam\u2019s Indonesian business for $2 billion.\n\nBesides scaling up his paints business, Goh had ventured into real estate and healthcare during his lifetime. He developed the former Liang Court mixed-use complex at Clark Quay and the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in the Orchard Road shopping precinct. Both properties have since been sold.\n\nThrough the Goh Foundation, which he established in 1995, the businessman contributed to initiatives such as the establishment of Singapore\u2019s National Cancer Center. The facility was subsequently expanded to include the Goh Cheng Liang Proton Therapy Centre, to provide patients advanced radiation treatment.",

      "text": "This story is part of Forbes' coverage of Singapore\u2019s Richest 2021. See the full list here.\nThe fortune of paints tycoon Goh Cheng Liang got a boost to $18.6 billion after his son Goh Hup Jin cemented a $12 billion stock-and-cash deal that gave Goh\u2019s privately held Wuthelam Holdings control of Nippon Paint, the world\u2019s fourth-largest paint maker by sales, and added $3.8 billion to his net worth.\nHup Jin, 68, chairman of Nippon Paint and managing director of Wuthelam, says the merger was a natural step between the longtime partners and \u201celiminated an unwieldy, unnecessarily complicated structure.\u201d\nAs per the agreement struck in August 2020, Wuthelam raised its stake in the Tokyo-listed company to 58.7% from 39.6%; in return, Nippon Paint bought out their Asian joint ventures. It also took over Wuthelam\u2019s Indonesian business for $2 billion.\nIt\u2019s been a remarkable journey for Goh, 94, who grew up in poverty. The one-time fishnet seller and rubber tapper stumbled into the paint business after World War II, buying cheap paint from the British army that he turned into a local paint brand called Pigeon. In 1962 he jumped at the opportunity to partner with Nippon Paint, then looking to expand into Southeast Asia."
