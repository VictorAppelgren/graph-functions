  "content": "Tasso has partnered with women's healthcare company SheMed to offer at-home blood testing for weight loss treatments in the UK.\n\nThis collaboration aims to personalise glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) therapies by utilising the Tasso+ blood collection device, enabling completion of comprehensive lab screenings before starting these treatments.\n\nThe Tasso+ device, a lancet that collects whole liquid blood samples, is compatible with multiple standard collection tubes and has received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Class II Lancet 510(k) clearance.\n\nTasso\u2019s virtually painless device is said to streamline blood sample collection to a brief and simple process, negating the need to visit a clinic.\n\nTasso co-founder and CEO Ben Casavant said: \u201cSimplifying blood collection and expanding patient access to essential health data is at the core of our mission at Tasso.\n\n\u201cOur UK collaboration with SheMed is a powerful example of how patient-centric innovation can close long-standing gaps in care and give individuals more control over their health.\u201d\n\nSheMed's care model is centred around this blood test, revealing essential health markers such as diabetes risk, liver function, thyroid activity and cardiovascular health.\n\nNotably, 99% of individuals display at least one out-of-range result at the time of initial screenings.\n\nThese insights enable the care team of SheMed to identify early health issues, tailor every treatment plan, monitor patient progress, and ensure the safe administration of GLP-1 therapy.\n\nSheMed CEO Olivia Ferro said: \u201cAt SheMed, our mission is to empower women to take control of their health through safe, accessible, and personalised treatment. Tasso gives our customers access to high-quality at-home blood testing, allowing us to deliver care that meets women where they are.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, Tasso secured CE mark certification for its TassoOne Plus high-volume liquid blood collection device.\n\n\"Tasso and SheMed to deliver weight loss treatments with blood testing in UK\" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\n\n The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.
