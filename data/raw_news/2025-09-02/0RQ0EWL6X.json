  "content": "At 17A, for instance, we\u2019re asked to name a [Neutral shade in some Florida d\u00e9cor?], which is TAMPA BEIGE. At 23A, the [Lighthearted invitation for joining one\u2019s sled team?] is SKIP TO MY LUGE. These are almost-but-not-quite common terms and phrases: 17A sounds like \u201cTampa Bay,\u201d and 23A sounds like \u201cSkip to My Lou\u201d (the song for a classic square-dancing game). Ditto at 50A: [Headline during a zombie attack?] might be THE DEAD SIEGE! That\u2019s a play on \u201cthe Dead Sea.\u201d And at 62A: One might refer to the [Price of makeup at the dollar store, informally?] as BUCK-A-ROUGE, which sounds like \u201cbuckaroo.\u201d\n\nSound familiar? (The puns in these entries, I mean.) To [Fancify] is to ZHUZH UP (38A) \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what Mr. Berg has done to the themed entries, phonetically speaking. ZHUZH UP \u201cTampa Bay,\u201d and it becomes TAMPA BEIGE. And so on.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

      "text": "For anyone who has gone square-dancing, the sights and sounds, melodies, and rhythms quickly become apparent. The activity is odd and fun, joyous and a bit hokey.\nVideos by American Songwriter\nBut most of all, the practice requires a specific type of soundtrack. Enter: \u201cSkip to My Lou.\u201d\nIn order to understand the fundamentals of square dancing, it\u2019s important to understand the fundamentals and meaning of the songs that produce its score. So, let\u2019s do just that.\nLet\u2019s go behind the meaning of the song, shall we?\nOrigins\nThe origins of \u201cSkip to My Lou\u201d and its meaning go all the way back to the 1840s. It\u2019s what\u2019s known in square dancing circles as a \u201cpartner-stealing\u201d song and dance.\nAccording to the poet and Abraham Lincoln biographer, Carl Sandburg, \u201cSkip to My Lou\u201d was a song popular at parties in southern Indiana. While there are many verses that have been associated with the song, some common refrains include, \u201cI\u2019ll get her back in spite of you,\u201d \u201cGone again, what shall I do\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll get another girl sweeter than you.\u201d\nIn a time when partnership was prized and also aided by a little harmless flirting, the partner-stealing ode was a welcome bit of fun.\nThe \u201cSkip to My Lou\u201d Dance\nThe dance associated with the song begins with a number of couples. They match up, touching hands and skipping around a ring. Traditionally, a lone young man stands in the center of the moving partner circles and sings the song, beginning, \u201cLost my partner, what\u2019ll I do?\u201d\nThen things get a little more interesting.\nThe fella in the center begins to decide which girl he\u2019d like to dance with, continuing his singing, \u201cI\u2019ll get another one just like you!\u201d When he reaches out for the hand of his chosen lass, the girl\u2019s partner moves to the center of the ring, taking the first\u2019s place.\nAll of a sudden, young men are becoming acquainted with other young ladies and vice-versa. That is the meaning and the importance of the song and dance. It puts smiles on all who choose to enjoy the action.\nHidden Historical Connections\nWriter S. Frederick Starr has suggested that the song \u201cSkip to My Lou\u201d originally came from the Creole folksong, \u201cLolotte Pov\u2019piti Lolotte.\u201d The two songs bear a strong resemblance. And the word \u201clou\u201d in the title and the song\u2019s refrain comes from the Scottish word for \u201clove.\u201d\nIn Popular Culture\nThe song, \u201cSkip to My Lou,\u201d was featured in the popular 1944 movie Meet Me In St. Louis and is also sung in the 1951 movie Across the Wide Missouri, starring famed actor Clark Gable. In 1956, Ken Curtis uses the song to serenade Vera Miles in the Western movie The Searchers.\nOther big-name musicians, including Lead Belly, Pete Seeger, Judy Garland, and Nat King Cole, have recorded versions of the track. Today, the song is a popular number to sing by kids in the classroom or in musical settings.\nIn 2010, the Jamaican dancehall artist Serene released a version of the track, titled, \u201cSkip to My Luu,\u201d and in 2009, RDX released a dancehall reggae version, called, \u201cSkip.\u201d\nVarious Verses\nThroughout history, there have been myriad verses added as part of the song.\nTraditionally, it begins:\nLost my partner\nWhat\u2019ll I do?\nLost my partner\nWhat\u2019ll I do?\nLost my partner\nWhat\u2019ll I do?\nSkip to my lou, my darlin\u2019\nSkip, skip, skip to my Lou\nSkip, skip, skip to my Lou\nSkip, skip, skip to my Lou\nSkip to my Lou, my darlin\u2019\nBut there are a number of variations, too, many of them with silly, fun meanings, including:\n- Fly in the buttermilk, shoo, fly, shoo.\n- There\u2019s a little red wagon, paint it blue.\n- I\u2019ll get another, as pretty as you.\n- Can\u2019t get a red bird, jay bird\u2019ll do.\n- Cat\u2019s in the cream jar, ooh, ooh, ooh.\n- Off to Texas, two by two.\n- Cows in the pasture two by two!\n- Found my partner love is true!\nSo sing whatever versions you like best. The meaning expressed is up to you,\nBelow, check out three versions of the popular song, including the rendition from the film, Meet Me In St. Louis, as well as one from a children\u2019s music classroom.\nPhoto by Gettyimages.com\nLeave a Reply\nOnly members can comment.
