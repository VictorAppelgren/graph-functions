  "description": "After court battles led to unfavorable rulings on ICE tactics, birthright citizenship and other issues, the Trump administration appears ready to continuing pushing the limits of what judges will tolerate.",
  "content": "Minutes after Sec. of Defense Pete Hegseth trumpeted plans to \"flood\" Washington with National Guard troops, a senior U.S. military official took the stand in federal court in California to defend the controversial deployment of soldiers to Los Angeles.\n\nThe move during protests earlier this summer has since become the model for President Trump's increasing use of soldiers to police American streets.\n\nBut the trial, which opened Monday in San Francisco, turns on the argument by California that Trump's troops have been illegally engaged in civilian law enforcement.\n\n\"The military in Southern California are so tied in with ICE and other law enforcement agencies that they are practically indistinguishable,\" California Deputy Atty. Gen. Meghan Strong told the court Tuesday.\n\n\"Los Angeles is just the beginning,\" the attorney went on. \"President Trump has hinted at sending troops even farther, naming Baltimore and even Oakland here in the Bay Area as his next potential targets.\"\n\nSenior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer said in court that Hegseth's statements Monday could tip the scales in favor of the state, which must show the law is likely to be violated again so long as troops remain.\n\nBut the White House hasn't let the pending case stall its agenda. Nor have Trump officials been phased by a judge's order restricting so-called \"roving patrols\" used by federal agents to indiscriminately sweep up suspected immigrants.\n\nAfter Border Patrol agents last week sprang from a Penske moving truck and snatched up workers at a Westlake Home Depot \u2014 appearing to openly defy the court's order \u2014 some attorneys warned the rule of law is crumbling in plain sight.\n\n\"It is just breathtaking,\" said Mark Rosenbaum of Public Counsel, part of the coalition challenging the use of racial profiling by immigration enforcement. \"Somewhere there are Founding Fathers who are turning over in their graves.\"\n\nThe chaotic immigration arrests that swept through Los Angeles this summer had all but ceased following the original July 11 order, which bars agents from snatching people off the streets without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.\n\nAn Aug. 1 ruling in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals seemed to assure they could not resume again for weeks, if ever.\n\nRead more: Trump administration asks Supreme Court to lift limits on ICE's 'roving patrols'\n\nFor the punch-drunk Department of Justice, the 9th Circuit loss was the latest blow in a protracted judicial beatdown, as many of the administration's most aggressive moves have been held back by federal judges and tied up in appellate courts.\n\n\"[Trump] is losing consistently in the lower courts, almost 9 times out of 10,\" said Eric J. Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law.\n\nIn the last two weeks alone, the 9th Circuit also found Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship unconstitutional and signaled it would likely rule in favor of a group of University of California researchers hoping to claw back funding from Trump's war on so-called DEI policies.\n\nElsewhere in the U.S., the D.C. Circuit court appeared poised to block Trump's tariffs, while a federal judge in Miami temporarily stopped construction at Alligator Alcatraz.\n\nCalifornia Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta has crowed that his Department of Justice had sued the administration nearly 40 times.\n\nBut even the breakneck pace of current litigation is glacial compared with the actions of immigration agents and federalized troops.\n\nFederal officials have publicly relished big-footing Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who have repeatedly warned the city is being used as a \"petri dish\" for executive force.\n\nOn Monday, the White House seemed to vindicate them by sending the National Guard to Washington.\n\nSpeaking for more than half an hour, President Trump rattled off a list of American cities he characterized as under siege.\n\nWhen asked if he would deploy troops to those cities as well, the president said, \"We're just gonna see what happens.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re going to look at New York. And if we need to, we\u2019re going to do the same thing in Chicago,\" he said. \"Hopefully, L.A. is watching.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice argues that the same power that allows the president to federalize troops and deploy them on American streets also creates a \"Constitutional exception\" to the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th century law that bars the soldiers from civilian police action.\n\nCalifornia lawyers say no such exception exists.\n\n\"I\u2019m looking at this case and trying to figure out, is there any limitation to the use of federal forces?\" Judge Breyer said.\n\nEven if they keep taking losses, Trump administration officials \"don\u2019t have much to lose\" by picking fights, said Ilya Somin, law professor at George Mason University and a Constitutional scholar at the Cato Institute.\n\n\"The base likes it,\" Somin said of the Trump's most controversial moves. \"If they lose, they can consider whether they defy the court.\"\n\n\"The bigger question is whether the courts can actually do anything to enforce the orders that they're making,\" said David J. Bier of the Cato Institute. \"There\u2019s no indication to me that [Department of Homeland Security agents] are changing their behavior.\"\n\nSome scholars speculated the lower court bloodbath might actually be a strategic sacrifice in the war to extend presidential power in the Supreme Court.\n\nRead more: Chokeholds, bikers and 'roving patrols': Are Trump's ICE tactics legal?\n\n\"It\u2019s not a strategy whose primary ambition is to win,\" said Professor Mark Graber of the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. \"They are losing cases right and left in the district court, but consistently having district court orders stayed in the Supreme Court.\"\n\nWin or lose in the lower courts, the political allure of targeting California is potent, argued Segall, the law professor who studies the Supreme Court.\n\n\"There is an emotional hostility to California that people on the West Coast don\u2019t understand,\" Segall said. \"California...is deemed a separate country almost.\"\n\nAn favorable ruling in the Supreme Court could pave the way for deployments across the country, he and others warned.\n\n\"We don\u2019t want the military on America\u2019s streets, period full stop,\" Segall said. \"I don\u2019t think martial law is off the table.\"\n\nPedro V\u00e1squez Perdomo, a day laborer who is one of the plaintiffs on the Southern California case challenging racial profiling by immigration enforcement, has said the case is bigger than him.\n\nHe squared up to the podium outside the American Civil Liberties Union's downtown offices Aug. 4, his voice trembling as he spoke about the temporary restraining order \u2014 upheld days earlier by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 that stood between his fellow Angelenos and unchecked federal authority.\n\n\"I don't want silence to be my story,\" the day-laborer said. \"I want justice for me and for every other person who's humanity has been denied.\"\n\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

The case centers on California's claim that the military is illegally involved in civilian law enforcement, with the military's presence being so closely linked with ICE and other law enforcement agencies. The White House has not let this case to stall its agenda, despite a recent court ruling limiting ICE's \"roving patrols\" used to indiscriminately sweep up suspected immigrants.

      "text": "Trump administration asks Supreme Court to lift limits on ICE\u2019s \u2018roving patrols\u2019\n- Share via\nThe Trump administration on Thursday petitioned the Supreme Court to free up its mass deportation efforts across Southern California, seeking to lift a ban on \u201croving patrols\u201d implemented after a lower court found such tactics likely violate the 4th Amendment.\nThe restrictions, initially handed down in a July 11 order, bar masked and heavily armed agents from snatching people off the streets of Los Angeles and cities in seven other counties without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.\nUnder the 4th Amendment, reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on race, ethnicity, language, location or employment, either alone or in combination, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong of Los Angeles found in her original decision.\nThe Trump administration said in its appeal to the high court that Frimpong\u2019s ruling, upheld last week by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, \u201cthreatens to upend immigration officials\u2019 ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.\u201d\nLawyers behind the lawsuits challenging the immigration tactics immediately questioned the Trump administration\u2019s arguments.\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said Mark Rosenbaum of Public Counsel, part of the coalition of civil rights groups and individual attorneys challenging cases of three immigrants and two U.S. citizens swept up in chaotic arrests. \u201cThe brief is asking the Supreme Court to bless open season on anybody on Los Angeles who happens to be Latino.\u201d\nThe move comes barely 24 hours after heavily armed Border Patrol agents snared workers outside a Westlake Home Depot after popping out of the back of a Penske moving truck \u2014 actions some experts said appeared to violate the court\u2019s order.\nIf the Supreme Court takes up the case, many now think similar aggressive and seemingly indiscriminate enforcement actions could once again become the norm.\n\u201cAnything having to do with law enforcement and immigration, the Supreme Court seems to be giving the president free rein,\u201d said Eric J. Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law and a prominent scholar of the country\u2019s highest court. \u201cI think the court is going to side with the Trump administration.\u201d\nThe Department of Justice has repeatedly argued that the temporary restraining order causes \u201cmanifest irreparable harm\u201d to the government. Officials are especially eager to see it overturned because California\u2019s Central District is the single most populous in the country, and home to a plurality of undocumented immigrants.\nIn its Supreme Court petition, the Justice Department alleged that roughly 10% of the region\u2019s residents are in the U.S. illegally.\n\u201cAccording to estimates from Department of Homeland Security data, nearly 4 million illegal aliens are in California, and nearly 2 million are in the Central District of California. Los Angeles County alone had an estimated 951,000 illegal aliens as of 2019 \u2014 by far the most of any county in the United States,\u201d the petition said.\nPresident Trump made mass deportations a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign, and has poured billions in federal funding and untold political capital into the arrest, incarceration and removal of immigrants. Though Justice Department lawyers told the appellate court there was no policy or quota, administration officials and those involved in planning its deportation operations have repeatedly cited 3,000 arrests a day and a million deportations a year as objectives.\nDistrict and appellate courts have stalled, blocked and sometimes reversed many of those efforts in recent weeks, forcing the return of a Maryland father mistakenly deported to Salvadoran prison, compelling the release of student protesters from ICE detention, preserving birthright citizenship for children of immigrant parents and stopping construction of \u201cAlligator Alcatraz.\u201d\nBut little of the president\u2019s immigration agenda has so far been tested in the Supreme Court.\nIf the outcome is unfavorable for Trump, some observers wonder whether he will let the justices limit his agenda.\n\u201cEven if they were to lose in the Supreme Court, I have serious doubts they will stop,\u201d Segall said."

      "text": "Chokeholds, bikers and \u2018roving patrols\u2019: Are Trump\u2019s ICE tactics legal?\n- Share via\n- The appellate court battle over whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement can resume \u2018roving patrols\u2019 across the L.A. area hangs on dueling legal precedents that involve the Los Angeles Police Department and the California Highway Patrol.\nAn appellate court appears poised to side with the federal judge who blocked immigration agents from conducting \u201croving patrols\u201d and snatching people off the streets of Southern California, likely setting up another Supreme Court showdown.\nArguments in the case were held Monday before a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, with the judges at times fiercely questioning the lawyer for the Trump administration about the constitutionality of seemingly indiscriminate sweeps by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to understand what would motivate the officers ... to grab such a large number of people so quickly and without marshaling reasonable suspicion to detain,\u201d said Judge Ronald M. Gould of Seattle.\nA federal appeals court upheld a ruling that struck down a background check requirement implemented by California on buyers of ammunition for firearms.\nEarlier this month, a lower court judge issued a temporary restraining order that has all but halted the aggressive operations by masked federal agents, saying they violate the 4th Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\nThe Justice Department called the block that was ordered by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong \u201cthe first step\u201d in a \u201cwholesale judicial usurpation\u201d of federal authority.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious thing to say that multiple federal government agencies have a policy of violating the Constitution,\u201d Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Yaakov M. Roth argued Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that happened, and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair we were hit with this sweeping injunction on an unfair and incomplete record.\u201d\nThat argument appeared to falter in front of the 9th Circuit panel. Judges Jennifer Sung of Portland, Ore., and Marsha S. Berzon of San Francisco heard the case alongside Gould \u2014 all drawn from the liberal wing of an increasingly split appellate division.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not actually doing what the District Court found you to be doing and enjoined you from doing, then there should be no harm,\u201d Sung said.\nFrimpong\u2019s order stops agents from using race, ethnicity, language, accent, location or employment as a pretext for immigration enforcement across Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. The judge found that without other evidence, those criteria alone or in combination do not meet the 4th Amendment bar for reasonable suspicion.\n\u201cIt appears that they are randomly selecting Home Depots where people are standing looking for jobs and car washes because they\u2019re car washes,\u201d Berzon said. \u201cIs your argument that it\u2019s OK that it\u2019s happening, or is your argument that it\u2019s not happening?\u201d\nRoth largely sidestepped that question, reiterating throughout the 90-minute hearing that the government had not had enough time to gather evidence it was following the Constitution and that the court did not have authority to constrain it in the meantime.\nAfter a federal judge in Los Angeles barred \u2018roving patrols\u2019 by immigration agents in seven California counties, the Trump administration asked the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to resume operations that lawyers for the state have argued are unconstitutional.\nArguments in the case hinge on a pair of dueling Golden State cases that together define the scope of relief courts can offer under the 4th Amendment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the bulwark of privacy protection against policing,\u201d said professor Orin S. Kerr of Stanford Law School, whose work on 4th Amendment injunctions was cited in the Justice Department\u2019s briefing. \u201cWhat the government can do depends on really specific details. That makes it hard for a court to say here\u2019s the thing you can\u2019t do.\u201d\nIn policing cases, every exception to the rule has its own exceptions, the expert said.\nThe Department of Justice has staked its claim largely on City of Los Angeles vs. Lyons, a landmark 1983 Supreme Court decision about illegal chokeholds by the Los Angeles Police Department. In that case, the court ruled against a blanket ban on the practice, finding the Black motorist who had sued was unlikely to ever be choked by the police again.\n\u201cThat dooms plaintiffs\u2019 standing here,\u201d the Justice Department wrote.\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union and its partners point to other precedents, including the San Diego biker case Easyriders Freedom F.I.G.H.T. vs. Hannigan. Decided in the 9th Circuit in 1996, the ruling offers residents of the American West more 4th Amendment protection than they might have in Texas, New York or Illinois.\nIn the Easyriders case, 14 members of a Southland motorcycle club successfully blocked the California Highway Patrol from citing almost any bikers they suspected of wearing the wrong kind of helmet, after the court ruled a more narrow decision would leave the same bikers vulnerable to future illegal citations.\n\u201cThe court said these motorcyclists are traveling around the state, so we can\u2019t afford the plaintiff\u2019s complete relief unless we allow this injunction to be statewide,\u201d said professor Geoffrey Kehlmann, who directs the 9th Circuit Appellate Clinic at Loyola Law School.\n\u201cIn situations like this, where you have roving law enforcement throughout a large area and you have the plaintiffs themselves moving throughout this large area, you necessarily need to have that broader injunction,\u201d Kehlmann said.\nFrimpong cited Easyriders among other precedent cases in her ruling, saying it offered a clear logic for the districtwide injunction. The alternative \u2014 agents sweeping through car washes and Home Depot parking lots stopping to ask each person they grab if they are a plaintiff in the suit \u2014 \u201cwould be a fantasy,\u201d she wrote.\nAnother expert, Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law, said the Los Angeles Police Department chokehold case set a standard that litigants \u201cneed to show it\u2019s likely it could happen to you again in the future.\u201d\nBut, he added: \u201cThe 9th Circuit has said, here\u2019s ways you can show that.\u201d\nThe tests can include asking whether the contested enforcement is limited to a small geographic area or applied to a small group of people, and whether it is part of a policy.\n\u201cAfter the injunction here, the secretary of Homeland Security said, \u2018We\u2019re going to continue doing what we\u2019re doing,\u2019\u201d Berzon said. \u201cIs that not a policy?\u201d\nRoth denied that there was any official policy driving the sweeps.\n\u201cPlaintiffs [argue] the existence of an official policy of violating the 4th Amendment with these stops,\u201d Roth said. \u201cThe only evidence of our policy was a declaration that said, \u2018Yes, reasonable suspicion is what we require when we go beyond a consensual encounter.\u2019\u201d\nBut Mohammad Tajsar of the ACLU of Southern California, part of a coalition of civil rights groups and individual attorneys challenging cases of three immigrants and two U.S. citizens swept up in chaotic arrests, argued that the federal policy is clear.\n\u201cThey have said, \u2018If it ends in handcuffs, go out and do it,\u2019\u201d he told the panel. \u201cThere\u2019s been a wink and a nod to agents on the ground that says, \u2018Dispatch with the rigors of the law and go out and snatch anybody out there.\u2019\u201d\nHe said that put his organization\u2019s clients in a similar situation to the bikers.\n\u201cThe government did not present any alternatives as to what an injunction could look like that would provide adequate relief to our plaintiffs,\u201d Tajsar said. \u201cThat\u2019s fatal to any attempt by them to try to get out from underneath this injunction.\u201d\nThe Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement tactics, he said, are \u201clikely to ensnare just as many people with status as without status.\u201d\nThe Justice Department said ICE already complies with the 4th Amendment, and that the injunction risks a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on lawful arrests.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s chilling ICE from violating the Constitution, that\u2019s where they\u2019re supposed to be chilled,\u201d Chemerinsky said.\nA ruling is expected as soon as this week. Roth signaled the administration is likely to appeal if the appellate panel does not grant its stay."

      "text": "Trial in National Guard lawsuit tests whether Trump will let courts limit authority\n- Share via\n- A civil trial in San Francisco is being held to determine whether troops deployed by the Trump administration have been illegally engaged in civilian law enforcement.\n- Some legal experts are concerned that Trump officials are disregarding a court order by continuing to use indiscriminate tactics for immigration enforcement.\nMinutes after Sec. of Defense Pete Hegseth trumpeted plans to \u201cflood\u201d Washington with National Guard troops, a senior U.S. military official took the stand in federal court in California to defend the controversial deployment of soldiers to Los Angeles.\nThe move during protests earlier this summer has since become the model for President Trump\u2019s increasing use of soldiers to police American streets.\nBut the trial, which opened Monday in San Francisco, turns on the argument by California that Trump\u2019s troops have been illegally engaged in civilian law enforcement.\n\u201cThe military in Southern California are so tied in with ICE and other law enforcement agencies that they are practically indistinguishable,\u201d California Deputy Atty. Gen. Meghan Strong told the court Tuesday.\n\u201cLos Angeles is just the beginning,\u201d the attorney went on. \u201cPresident Trump has hinted at sending troops even farther, naming Baltimore and even Oakland here in the Bay Area as his next potential targets.\u201d\nSenior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer said in court that Hegseth\u2019s statements Monday could tip the scales in favor of the state, which must show the law is likely to be violated again so long as troops remain.\nBut the White House hasn\u2019t let the pending case stall its agenda. Nor have Trump officials been phased by a judge\u2019s order restricting so-called \u201croving patrols\u201d used by federal agents to indiscriminately sweep up suspected immigrants.\nAfter Border Patrol agents last week sprang from a Penske moving truck and snatched up workers at a Westlake Home Depot \u2014 appearing to openly defy the court\u2019s order \u2014 some attorneys warned the rule of law is crumbling in plain sight.\n\u201cIt is just breathtaking,\u201d said Mark Rosenbaum of Public Counsel, part of the coalition challenging the use of racial profiling by immigration enforcement. \u201cSomewhere there are Founding Fathers who are turning over in their graves.\u201d\nThe chaotic immigration arrests that swept through Los Angeles this summer had all but ceased following the original July 11 order, which bars agents from snatching people off the streets without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.\nAn Aug. 1 ruling in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals seemed to assure they could not resume again for weeks, if ever.\nThe Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court to free up its mass deportation efforts across Southern California, seeking to end a judge\u2019s ban on \u2018roving patrols.\u2019\nFor the punch-drunk Department of Justice, the 9th Circuit loss was the latest blow in a protracted judicial beatdown, as many of the administration\u2019s most aggressive moves have been held back by federal judges and tied up in appellate courts.\n\u201c[Trump] is losing consistently in the lower courts, almost 9 times out of 10,\u201d said Eric J. Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law.\nIn the last two weeks alone, the 9th Circuit also found Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship unconstitutional and signaled it would likely rule in favor of a group of University of California researchers hoping to claw back funding from Trump\u2019s war on so-called DEI policies.\nElsewhere in the U.S., the D.C. Circuit court appeared poised to block Trump\u2019s tariffs, while a federal judge in Miami temporarily stopped construction at Alligator Alcatraz.\nCalifornia Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta has crowed that his Department of Justice had sued the administration nearly 40 times.\nBut even the breakneck pace of current litigation is glacial compared with the actions of immigration agents and federalized troops.\nFederal officials have publicly relished big-footing Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who have repeatedly warned the city is being used as a \u201cpetri dish\u201d for executive force.\nOn Monday, the White House seemed to vindicate them by sending the National Guard to Washington.\nSpeaking for more than half an hour, President Trump rattled off a list of American cities he characterized as under siege.\nWhen asked if he would deploy troops to those cities as well, the president said, \u201cWe\u2019re just gonna see what happens.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to look at New York. And if we need to, we\u2019re going to do the same thing in Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, L.A. is watching.\u201d\nThe Department of Justice argues that the same power that allows the president to federalize troops and deploy them on American streets also creates a \u201cConstitutional exception\u201d to the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th century law that bars the soldiers from civilian police action.\nCalifornia lawyers say no such exception exists.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at this case and trying to figure out, is there any limitation to the use of federal forces?\u201d Judge Breyer said.\nEven if they keep taking losses, Trump administration officials \u201cdon\u2019t have much to lose\u201d by picking fights, said Ilya Somin, law professor at George Mason University and a Constitutional scholar at the Cato Institute.\n\u201cThe base likes it,\u201d Somin said of the Trump\u2019s most controversial moves. \u201cIf they lose, they can consider whether they defy the court.\u201d\nOther experts agreed.\n\u201cThe bigger question is whether the courts can actually do anything to enforce the orders that they\u2019re making,\u201d said David J. Bier of the Cato Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication to me that [Department of Homeland Security agents] are changing their behavior.\u201d\nSome scholars speculated the lower court bloodbath might actually be a strategic sacrifice in the war to extend presidential power in the Supreme Court.\nThe appellate court battle over whether ICE can resume \u2018roving patrols\u2019 across the Los Angeles area hangs on dueling legal precedents that involve the LAPD and the CHP.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a strategy whose primary ambition is to win,\u201d said Professor Mark Graber of the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. \u201cThey are losing cases right and left in the district court, but consistently having district court orders stayed in the Supreme Court.\u201d\nWin or lose in the lower courts, the political allure of targeting California is potent, argued Segall, the law professor who studies the Supreme Court.\n\u201cThere is an emotional hostility to California that people on the West Coast don\u2019t understand,\u201d Segall said. \u201cCalifornia...is deemed a separate country almost.\u201d\nAn favorable ruling in the Supreme Court could pave the way for deployments across the country, he and others warned.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the military on America\u2019s streets, period full stop,\u201d Segall said. \u201cI don\u2019t think martial law is off the table.\u201d\nPedro V\u00e1squez Perdomo, a day laborer who is one of the plaintiffs on the Southern California case challenging racial profiling by immigration enforcement, has said the case is bigger than him.\nHe squared up to the podium outside the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s downtown offices Aug. 4, his voice trembling as he spoke about the temporary restraining order \u2014 upheld days earlier by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 that stood between his fellow Angelenos and unchecked federal authority.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want silence to be my story,\u201d the day-laborer said. \u201cI want justice for me and for every other person who\u2019s humanity has been denied.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "A federal trial in San Francisco is examining whether the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles and other cities constitutes illegal civilian law enforcement. California argues that the military's close ties with ICE blur the lines between military and law enforcement roles, while the Trump administration claims a constitutional exception allows such actions. The case highlights ongoing tensions over immigration enforcement tactics and the potential for expanded military presence in American cities, raising concerns about the erosion of civil liberties.",
