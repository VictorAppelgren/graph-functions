  "content": "College can be a life-changing opportunity for young people to get an education, grow their network, and kick-start their careers.For some students, it can also be a four-year-long, nonstop party.Across the country, thousands of students live by the \"work hard, party hard\" motto. Every fall, colleges host campus events for Homecoming, such as themed parties, parades, and sporting events, oftentimes resulting in weeklong celebrations.This year, the University of California \u2014 Santa Barbara is the place to be: It was ranked the No. 1 party school in the US for 2026 in a new Niche ranking.Still, there are plenty of schools that know how to have a good time.One school, the University of Miami, has a boat-burning ceremony in which scores of students gather around Lake Osceola in Coral Gables, Florida, to watch a boat set on fire.At another, Texas State University, which has campuses in San Marcos and Round Rock, Texas, students engage in competitive games, such as the annual Soap Box Derby, where students build their own cars.Fall campus celebrations also boost local economies. Virginia's Hampton University, for example, noted in 2024 that annual events, including homecoming and commencement, bring in more than $5.2 billion annually to the historically Black university.Every year, Niche publishes a list of the best party schools in the US as part of its annual best colleges list. To identify the top party schools, the site looks at student surveys of the party scene on campus, athletics and Greek life ratings, and access to bars and restaurants based on US Census data.The University of California \u2014 Santa Barbara took the crown for the top party school this year, and Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, followed in second place.Here's a closer look at the best party schools that made the list.",

      "text": "The bars and restaurants that put the glint on New York City never stopped partying.\nWhile the rest of the country \u2014 businesses, investors, economists, regular people \u2014 misspent 2023 in a state of anxiety, waiting for a recession that never came, the bastions of New York City's dining elite came out of the pandemic louder, prouder, and more extravagant than ever.\nHere, it's ancient Rome. And if New York City has a legalized form of popular bloodsport, it's the restaurant business.\nTo dine at the most sought-after restaurants is an exercise in one's capacity to tolerate rejection. In old New York, money and cache were the currencies that could, eventually, find you a seat wherever you wanted. But the internet and reservation apps like Resy have removed person-to-person contact in these bookings and turned scoring a coveted table into the shortest video game ever played. Status still talks, but tech nerds who've programmed bots to crawl for reservations have added a disconcerting new layer. Recently, I met a man who has a constant crawl for a five-person table at a chic new restaurant. He was very proud of himself for this. I was not.\nThe surge of demand doesn't mean everything has been easy. Food prices have risen steadily, the hot job market has made workers hard to find and keep, and, of course, there's the inexorable rise of New York City rents. Yet new restaurants have kept coming. And not just any restaurants \u2014 luxurious, maximalist restaurants with ingredients as international as the city itself.\nThe new wave of eateries is also a stark contrast to the previous era of NYC dining. After the financial crisis, the city put on a black turtleneck \u00e0 la Steve Jobs and presented everything with clean lines and prized understatement. Now it's returned to something that looks more like the Gilded Age \u2014 a maximalist mob-wife aesthetic that orders \"more with a side of much more.\" The city's bars have gone rococo as well. Is there a greater vote of confidence in New York's economic recovery than opening a tiki bar that feels like a dive, hangs florals like a wedding at the Grand Prospect Hall, and asks people to pay $25 for a cocktail called \"Tarman\"?\nBeneath the city's shimmering victory over the pandemic and dining's glorious return as Gotham's favorite pastime, there's still a great divide between the haves and the have-nots. As the pandemic emergency abated, our weird new economy revealed the dramatic difference between Americans who feel they can handle an inflationary shock and those who cannot. So it makes sense that Manhattan, where the income gap is greater than any other county in the country, has been the vanguard of this American vibe revolution. It is a granite island of hungry rich people looking for something to do \u2014 Wall Street bankers, tech executives, generationally wealthy people, the famous and beautiful. In a country roiled by recession worries, those at the top of New York City \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 couldn't give a single gilded shit.\nThe Big Apple bites back\nOpening a new business anywhere is an act of hope. Opening a restaurant even more so. Opening a restaurant in New York City requires the faith of a medieval saint. For an industry that already existed on a knife's edge, the pandemic looked like it could be a catastrophic blow. Were it not for delivery apps, creative outdoor seating, and many New Yorkers' stubborn resistance to learning to use their apartment kitchens, we might have lost even more of our eateries than we did. In this town, an unlisted, unmarked, hole-in-the-wall serving top-flight Xinjiang noodles can be every bit a destination as Tavern on the Green \u2014 and the food will probably be better. Even with this chaos, New York is a city that embraces bizarre circumstances, and when the pandemic took hold, that became its superpower.\n\"I think the city and New Yorkers are so different and so unfazed by it. Remember when there were a million people eating outside?\" Jennifer Saesue, a Manhattan restaurateur, said.\nSaesue opened her first restaurant, Fish Cheeks, in 2017, and before long, it became a staple for the downtown set. During the pandemic, Fish Cheeks survived as other restaurants did \u2014 ramping up takeout and setting up outdoor seating. Saesue said that after a lull during lockdowns, its revenue clicked back into the normal cycle of the city's restaurant business: a slow start to the year, a busy spring, a slower summer, and then full-on mania starting in the fall and through the holiday season.\nThere are new, hot restaurants opening every freaking week.\nSince then, New Yorkers staved off recession fears by simply spending like it would never come \u2014 especially on food, drinks, and entertainment. By the end of March 2023, nightlife spending reached 11% above pre-pandemic levels, a report from Mastercard found. It's not hard to understand why. Few people in the country lived as cramped an existence through the pandemic as New Yorkers did. Once it was over, they bet everything on the return of the institutions that form the backbone of the city's culture. The rest of the country could keep their weak vibes. For New York City, a brush with death called for a time of decadence.\n\"I feel like we are back to where we were pre-pandemic. Now more than ever, people are spending, and even more so, restaurants are opening back up,\" Saesue told me. \"There are new, hot restaurants opening every freaking week.\"\nSo that's what the city's doing now. Get into it. Clubsteraunts are back, and Gen Z \u2014 a generation that claims to dislike fun \u2014 can be seen there in full force. The city's bistros have met this enthusiasm by upping their game. Chefs in New York have somehow yassified hard-boiled eggs, and LCD Soundsystem's frontman James Murphy has a restaurant that's selling them for $25. Naturally, those eggs have caviar on them. There's caviar everywhere. At Coqodaq, a just-opened Korean fried chicken restaurant that looks like a Las Vegas church, you can order a perfectly crisped nugget with caviar on it. It will cost you $28 and whatever it takes you to get through a meal while watching packs of TikTok food influencers completely lose their minds.\nAs the kids might say, \"Nature is healing.\" The city's affluent consists of the same Wall Street workhorses, fashion and public-relations power brokers, trust-fund babies (American and foreign), chic people, quasi-creatives of advertising, total nerds of tech, and straight-up, never-sleeping hustlers \u2014 but their tastes have changed. Members-only social clubs and restaurants abound. The new Aman New York has a private club with a $200,000 initiation fee, and the boys who brought us Carbone have a private restaurant called ZZ's with a $20,000 initiation fee and $10,000 annual membership. There are the Casas \u2014 Cruz and Cipriani (both private clubs, no relation) \u2014 and the old mainstay Soho House, which has expanded to three locations in the city. Private clubs delineating the space between the haves and the have-nots were a feature of the first Gilded Age. Here we are again, except now the most sought-after restaurants can function almost as exclusively as clubs \u2014 know someone, wait for hours, game the digital-reservation system, beg (maybe) \u2014 and then maybe you'll get a seat at a decent time to eat, like 9:30 p.m. (if you're lucky) or 5:30 p.m. (if you've given up on fun).\nIt doesn't seem like people are thinking about the recession that much. I think they're talking about it, but their behavior doesn't say that.\nSaesue opened her second concept, Bangkok Supper Club, in the West Village in 2023. It was immediately met with critical acclaim and the kind of success that makes getting a reservation an only-in-NYC kind of status symbol.\n\"Looking from where I am,\" Saesue told me, \"it doesn't seem like people are thinking about the recession that much. I think they're talking about it, but their behavior doesn't say that.\"\nA city is lucky if it has two or three dining rooms ethereal enough to transport you to a world in which everything you see or touch is precious. In the past few years, New York has opened them at a steady clip. Most recently, the famed chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten opened Four Twenty-Five on Park Avenue, where it feels like you are dining on a crystal cloud. It's a place to watch a very classic uptown New York City crowd \u2014 an older set of ultraprofessionals, mom and dad on date night, women who have enough money but too much self-awareness to be on \"Real Housewives,\" money managers drinking at the gorgeous bar after a late night at the office (yes, they're going to the office). For these people, there must be elegance at all times.\nNot all of NYC nightlife is focused on making things fancy; some of it is just theatrical and fun. In the East Village, Paradise Lost transports patrons to a tiki bar located on a choppy beach near the capitol of Hell. It works because the drinks are a full-on show. The Saturn, a vintage gin cocktail that won the 1967 IBA championship, comes smoking with dry ice. And if you order the Lady of the Beasts, you'll experience what the bar calls \"fire and show.\" Bongo drums will ring out through the bar, and your server will present the cocktail to you in a dazzle of flames. The Lady is just one of a few cocktails on the menu that come with all of that drama. If there is a hard landing for the US economy, NYC will have to meet it with a bit of a hangover. After what the city went through, it will have been worth it.\nThe full vibespace\nA survey of New York City's most glimmering restaurants and competitive cocktailers is, of course, an incomplete picture of how the city is recovering. The pandemic was a violent lesson in how an inflationary shock impacts the affluent much less than everyone else. And that makes for complex vibes.\nAccording to a report from TouchBistro, a company that provides point-of-sales services to restaurants, NYC restaurant margins averaged around 9.2% in 2023, down from 10.1% a year in 2022 and just below the national average of 9.3%. Food operators said they spent 43% more on food costs in 2023 than they did in 2022, the highest jump in the country. And while employers in other parts of the economy are regaining the upper hand, staff turnover at NYC restaurants was around 31% in 2023. The national average turnover rate sat at 28%. Every restaurant is facing these issues, but businesses' ability to deal with increasing costs \u2014 while holding onto customers \u2014 varies greatly. A December survey from the New York City Hospitality Alliance found that while 37% of respondents felt positive about future business revenue, 30% percent of respondents were feeling pessimistic about the future, and another 20% felt uncertain.\n\"New York City's restaurants and bars are experiencing an uneven pandemic recovery nearly four years after COVID-19 struck our city,\" Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, said. \"While some have recovered, others still struggle.\"\nThe restaurant industry is a mirror of the city. The haves are being delighted in new dining rooms and glittering new high-rises. The have-nots are experiencing the trauma of a record number of evictions, especially in Brooklyn and The Bronx, and the squeeze of record-high rents. No one seems to have an answer for New York's housing crisis, where rental vacancies dropped to 1.4% in 2023 \u2014 a healthy rate is considered somewhere between 5% and 8%.\nNationwide, in the aggregate, restaurants are growing. Sales reached a seasonally-adjusted rate of $95.01 billion in January, up 0.7% from December and the 11th month of consecutive growth. But that doesn't mean the mood is great: 97% of restaurant owners are worried about higher food costs, according to a survey from the National Restaurant Association, and 38% say they didn't make money last year. That's a lot of have-nots. In a moment when food prices are volatile at best and workers are hard to come by, most of the restaurant industry has to make hard decisions. As Corey Mintz argued in this very publication, we may hate what it takes to save restaurants \u2014 more self-service, higher prices \u2014 but we may not have a choice. I don't care how many times the Nasdaq punches new highs \u2014 this does not make for good vibes.\nThe city's last Gilded Age was as much a time of growth and vitality as it was a time of corruption and inequality.\nRestaurants are pinched, in part, because their patrons are pinched, too. Yes, the rest of the country is starting to see what New York City has been seeing: The worst is over. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed significant improvement over the past two months, and the outlook for inflation continues to improve. This is fantastic news for the country, but as analysts at UBS pointed out in a recent note to clients, just because we're not feeling bad doesn't mean we necessarily feel good.\n\"These are encouraging developments and sentiment should continue to improve as disinflation progresses, the Fed cuts rates and real incomes keep rising,\" the UBS analysts wrote. \"In short, the vibecession for the public at large may be over, but the vibespansion has a long way to go.\"\nInflation hurts everyone, but it is catastrophic for people who are just getting by \u2014 or just starting to save a little bit. In an extremely cringeworthy interview, WK Kellogg CEO Gary Pilnick seemed excited when he said his company's cereal-for-dinner messaging was \"landing really well.\"\n\"Cereal for dinner is something that is probably more on trend now, and we would expect to continue as that consumer is under pressure,\" he said. Since 1978, CEO pay has skyrocketed 1,460%, thanks mostly to stock-based compensation. When prices go up dramatically, those who can afford it may see it and know it, but they don't feel it. Those who can't, apparently, make Gary Pilnick's day.\nIf a pandemic can't defeat New York City, a little inflation certainly isn't going to do it. What it will do, though, is reveal the structural weaknesses in our society. The city's last Gilded Age was as much a time of growth and vitality as it was a time of corruption and inequality. It was a warning for this town and the whole country. Watching post-pandemic inflation at work is a warning, too. It showed what it looks like when this American economy experiences a short, sharp shock. And what that looks like is the affluent in New York City eating caviar, and poorer Americans eating cereal.\nLinette Lopez is a senior correspondent at Business Insider.\nBusiness Insider's Discourse stories provide perspectives on the day's most pressing issues, informed by analysis, reporting, and expertise."

      "text": "Greek life has long been one of the most popular methods of campus involvement at the University of Georgia, with 30% of undergraduate students participating in spring 2023. However, campus interest in panhellenic participation at UGA could be declining.\nThe total number of new Panhellenic members decreased by 55 in 2023, and the average chapter new member class size decreased by 10, compared to 2022.\nGreek life continues to garner attention through viral internet trends and documentaries. \u201cRush-tok,\u201d a concept in which women across the United States participating in recruitment can document their experience on TikTok, became popular in 2021. Videos oftentimes get millions of views.\nA documentary titled \u201cBama Rush\u201d was released in 2023 by HBO Max, which gave viewers an inside look at the recruitment process and emotional aftermath to The University of Alabama\u2019s sorority rush.\nDespite the recent exposure Greek life has received, the number of girls who became new members of a Panhellenic organization decreased from 1,843 in 2022 to 1,788 in 2023. The average Panhellenic new member class size decreased from 97 in 2022 to 87 in 2023.\nUGA freshman Caroline Feagin decided not to participate in Greek life during her time at the university because she felt it was not necessary to enhance her college experience.\n\u201cI think there's just a lot of opportunities on campus to find your people and get involved, so I didn't really think it would have been that big of a deal if I hadn\u2019t rushed,\u201d Feagin said.\nAndie Richardson, another freshman, did decide to go through recruitment. After round one \u2014 in which Potential New Members, otherwise known as \u201cPNMs,\u201d submit videos of themselves answering questions \u2014 many sororities did not invite her back, leaving her with little opportunity to meet and get to know members of each organization.\n\u201cWhat did I say in that video that like made so many people want to drop me?\u201d Richardson said.\nHowever, she withdrew from the Preference Round because she felt the process was not fair. Richardson said she felt many sororities participated in what is often referred to as \u201cdirty rushing,\u201d where sororities hold functions prior to the start of the recruitment process to influence PNMs to join their sorority as opposed to others.\n\u201cI would say the primary reason that people aren\u2019t doing it as much anymore is because it's not a fair process here at UGA,\u201d Richardson said.\nOliva Brown, a senior and past member of a Panhellenic organization, said she felt like many people are becoming less interested in Greek life because the reality of the sorority experience, rather than what is solely portrayed on social media, is becoming more apparent to the public.\n\u201cI feel like going into it, it\u2019s this huge idea or goal people have to be in it,\u201d said Brown. \u201cBut then once you\u2019re in it, it's like \u2018okay now I\u2019m here, and what am I doing this for?\u2019\u201d said Brown.\nSenior Landon Beall, another past member of a panhellenic organization, said she believes Greek life could increase campus interest by lowering costs and offering more scholarships to those who are interested in joining.\n\u201cI think it would [just] be like making them more accessible to everyone,\u201d said Beall. \u201cI think it should be available for anyone who wants to do it.\u201d"

Setting aside other categories such as \u201cBest Professors\u201d or \u201cHappiest Students,\u201d the hotly anticipated title of top party school in the nation went to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nThe title is one of 62 categories but it\u2019s, perhaps, the most provocative.\nRobert Franek, publisher for the Princeton Review, said that every college the company reviewed has excellent academics and that the rankings are a reflection of campus culture.\n\u201cOur 62 ranking lists provide students with a way to see the types of colleges that could help them achieve their future goals and dreams,\u201d Franek said in a news release.\nUniversity Chancellor Phyllis Wise said the ranking was not scientific and called it a \u201cpromotion\u201d by the Princeton Review.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that, once again, Princeton Review is promoting this pseudo-ranking as though it were meaningful,\u201d Wise said in a statement to CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s insulting to all of our students, since they are here to prepare to become leaders of their generation.\u201d\nShe said that the university\u2019s graduation rates and achievements of alumni show that students take academics seriously.\nThe University of Illinois has been in the Top 5 ranking in prior years, but this was its first year atop the list. The Midwest is well-represented in the party-school rankings with University of Iowa coming in second and University of Wisconsin-Madison third.\nThese schools stand in sharp contrast to Brigham Young University, which topped the list of \u201cStone-Cold Sober Schools.\u201d Other categories included \u201cBest College Dorms\u201d won by Bennington College in Vermont, \u201cBest College Library\u201d won by Yale University and \u201cBest Athletic Facilities\u201d won by Kenyon College in Ohio.\nThe Princeton Review creates the rankings after surveying a total of 136,000 students from the 380 colleges. Its survey includes 80 questions about student life, academics and administration. The company offers tutoring and test preparation as well."

      "text": "This California university, home of many Nobel laureates, topped 2025 party school list\n- Share via\nA California university that\u2019s home to a number of Nobel laureates has also gained the distinction of being the top party school in the United States, according to a recent ranking.\nUC Santa Barbara took the top spot in a list of party schools in the U.S. for 2025, released by Niche, an education research and ranking site.\nTo calculate the rankings, Niche \u2014 which uses a database of nearly 500,000 student college reviews \u2014 factored in student surveys on the party scene, access to bars, athletics grade, Greek life grade and access to restaurants.\nReviews from current and former students describe the university as \u201ccombining academic rigor with a laid-back coastal lifestyle\u201d and praised the \u201cvibrant student community.\u201d More than half a dozen Nobel Prize winners in economics, physics and chemistry \u2014 including David Card, Alan J. Heeger, Herbert Kroemer and Shuji Nakamura \u2014 have taught at UC Santa Barbara over the years.\n\u201cI used to be an over the top party guy but living in Santa Barbara/Isla Vista helped me form new healthy outdoor habits while learning out how to be more responsible,\u201d one student wrote. \u201cThere are so many activities you can partake in around town and on campus that is not partying ... It is literally heaven on earth for an 18-21 year old as long as you don\u2019t overdo it.\u201d\nBut one person, who described themselves as the parent of an alum, rated the university only two stars, complaining that students \u201cparty all day.\u201d\n\u201cCollege kids party, but UCSB is out of control,\u201d the person wrote.\nOne of the best-known party events is \u201cDeltopia,\u201d an unsanctioned spring break party that unfolds in April. The party, made popular among UC Santa Barbara students who live in Isla Vista near the campus, was paused during the COVID-19 pandemic but resumed in 2022, resulting in multiple arrests and citations during the weekend-long event.\nIn 2014, more than 20,000 people were estimated to have attended Deltopia, which devolved into a riot resulting in dozens of injuries and more than 100 arrests. The UC Santa Barbara student association at the time issued a statement saying that \u201cThe \u2018wild party\u2019 stereotype and image exists because we, the students, allow it to exist.\u201d\nThis year and last year, Santa Barbara County officials closed the beaches in Isla Vista in anticipation of Deltopia. Last year more than 150 people were issued citations, while 23 people were arrested.\nThe most recent Deltopia marked the most citations issued in the history of the event at 256, according to The Daily Nexus, a campus newspaper."

      "text": "Ranked #1 HBCU for Its Economic Impact in the Commonwealth of Virginia, Among Top HBCUs in the Nation for Economic Contributions\nAs Hampton Roads faces new economic challenges, institutions of higher education are stepping up to drive regional prosperity. Hampton University, with a legacy spanning more than 155 years, continues to be a key economic engine, contributing an impressive $530 million in economic impact to the Hampton Roads community. New preliminary findings reveal that the HBCU\u2019s influence extends far beyond the classroom, transforming the local economy and supporting thousands of jobs in the region.\nAccording to a recent UNCF report, Hampton University ranks as the #1 HBCU in economic impact in the Commonwealth of Virginia, while standing among the top historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the nation for economic contributions. This significant impact is fueled by Hampton\u2019s operational spending, wages, and institutional purchases, which support local businesses and stimulate the regional economy. Additionally, the indirect effects\u2014from student spending to the influx of visitors to campus\u2014create a ripple effect that generates millions more in sustained economic activity.\n\u201cHampton University plays a pivotal role in the economic fabric of Hampton Roads,\u201d said Hampton University President Darrell K. Williams. \u201cOur findings affirm and underscore our commitment to not only educating future leaders but also investing in the vitality of the region. Our community impact, especially during these times, speaks to the power of partnership and progress.\u201d\nThe University\u2019s role as an economic powerhouse is further reinforced by its recent recognition in Virginia Coastal magazine as the 2023 Best Private College, an accolade that not only highlights Hampton\u2019s academic excellence but also its unparalleled economic contributions to the Commonwealth.\nHampton University\u2019s contributions are visible across several sectors. The university supports approximately 2,200 jobs in the local and regional economies, including over 800 on-campus positions and additional roles created through university-related spending.\nEconomic Impact Breakdown\nJobs and Salaries:\nHampton University is a major employer in Hampton Roads, providing thousands of jobs for faculty, staff, and support personnel. These jobs contribute to the local workforce and bolster the economic stability of surrounding communities. In addition, wages earned by employees are spent locally, supporting industries like healthcare, retail, dining, and hospitality, thus creating a multiplier effect. In Hampton Roads, where the unemployment rate hovers around 3.7%, the job opportunities provided by the university are crucial for maintaining economic momentum.\nHousing:\nThe presence of Hampton University generates significant demand for housing in Hampton Roads, particularly in Hampton, Newport News, and surrounding cities. Faculty, staff, and students live both on and off-campus, which bolsters the local real estate market. This demand supports property values and contributes to new housing developments, particularly in rental housing, where occupancy rates remain high. In 2023, Hampton\u2019s residential rental market saw an average occupancy rate of 96.4%, a rate bolstered by the continuous demand from the university\u2019s student body and employees.\nPurchases of Retail Goods and Services:\nThe spending power of Hampton University\u2019s employees, students, and visitors results in substantial purchases of retail goods and services in the local community. From daily essentials such as groceries and transportation to leisure activities like dining and entertainment, this spending fuels local businesses. In 2023, retail sales in Hampton Roads exceeded $26 billion, with Hampton University\u2019s community contributing a significant share of that revenue. Additionally, the university itself spends millions on operational needs, contracting with local vendors and suppliers, further supporting the Hampton Roads business ecosystem.\nVisitors to Campus:\nHampton University attracts a significant number of visitors each year, including alumni, parents, and guests attending athletic events, Homecoming, Commencement, the Ministers\u2019 Conference, and the Hampton Jazz and Music Festival. These visitors contribute to the local economy by spending on accommodations, dining, transportation, and shopping. In Hampton Roads, tourism-related spending contributes over $5.2 billion annually, and Hampton University\u2019s events play a key role in generating this economic activity.\nYear-round Athletic Events:\nHampton University\u2019s athletics program, particularly in sports like football and basketball, brings in fans from across the region, generating revenue for local businesses. Spectators spend on tickets, merchandise, and local services, with popular games such as Homecoming and Community Day contributing significantly to the local economy. During the 2023-2024 season, Hampton\u2019s home football games alone brought over 25,000 spectators, injecting much-needed revenue into hotels, restaurants, and retail outlets.\nAnnual Events:\nSignature events like Commencement, the Ministers\u2019 Conference, Homecoming, and the Hampton Jazz and Music Festival attract large crowds from around the country, contributing millions of dollars to the local economy. The annual three-day Hampton Jazz and Music Festival draws approximately 20,000 attendees, delivering an estimated $3 million economic impact. These events not only bring revenue to local businesses but also enhance the region\u2019s reputation as a cultural and tourist destination.\nElevating Engagement, Embracing Innovation\nAs Hampton University moves forward under President Williams\u2019 leadership, the institution\u2019s 10-year strategic plan, Elevating Hampton Excellence, charts a bold path for expanding stakeholder engagement and driving economic development. The plan focuses on strengthening partnerships with local businesses, fostering innovation through research, and creating new avenues for growth that benefit the community.\nPresident Williams envisions untapped opportunities for universities to further enhance local economies\u2014such as technology transfer, entrepreneurship programs, and workforce development tailored to meet the region\u2019s evolving needs. By leveraging its intellectual capital, resources, and collaborative spirit, Hampton University is poised to become an even greater force for economic progress in Hampton Roads, ensuring a future of shared prosperity and collaboration.\nAbout Hampton University\nHampton University, a dynamic historically Black institution in southeastern Virginia with a legacy of excellence in education, research, and community service, provides a nurturing and empowering environment for students to thrive academically and personally.

      "text": "- New Orleans' guaranteed basic income pilot gave $350 monthly to 125 young people.\n- The pilot aimed to reduce poverty risk for teens and young adults disconnected from work and school.\n- Participants saw increased employment, but some struggled financially after payments ended.\nFor some young New Orleans residents, guaranteed basic income helped them afford a ride to work. For others, the money helped cover school supplies and uniforms.\nBetween April 2022 and January 2023, the city gave 125 young people $350 a month, no strings attached. The program intended to fill gaps in the social safety net (which includes programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and rental vouchers) and alleviate financial stress for people between the ages of 16 and 24.\nAll participants were considered \"opportunity youth\" \u2014 not enrolled in work or school \u2014 at the start of the pilot. They could spend their monthly $350 however they chose.\nResearchers released the program's final results on September 3. Per the report, guaranteed basic income helped some participants secure full-time employment and pursue educational opportunities.\nOne participant, whose name was withheld in the report for privacy, told researchers they used their $350 to replace a broken laptop so they could enroll in a coding class.\n\"I was able to go get the computer and solve that problem with no stress,\" they said in a statement. \"And it made me feel great \u2014 because if I wouldn't have had it, it would've been totally different.\"\nThe New Orleans guaranteed basic income pilot was a collaboration between Mayor LaToya Cantrell's Office of Youth and Families and the national advocacy network Mayors for a Guaranteed Income (MGI). The research was led by The Center for Guaranteed Income Research at the University of Pennsylvania, and the cash payments were largely financed by a $500,000 MGI grant.\nOver 100 similar guaranteed basic income programs have been launched across America, offering participants recurring cash payments for a set period of time. The cash payment model has been tried in cities like Los Angeles, Birmingham, Chicago, and Denver to combat local poverty and increase access to food and housing.\nMuch of New Orleans' recent GBI efforts have been on young people. Alongside guaranteed income for opportunity youth, the nonprofit Rooted School Foundation has been giving local high school students $50 a week since 2022.\nStill, New Orleans participants said their benefits from guaranteed income were temporary. After the pilot ended, some young people said they still struggled to afford groceries and pay bills.\nGuaranteed income helps opportunity youth secure jobs, pay for housing\nAbout one in six young people in Louisiana are not working or in school \u2014 and Black youth make up about half of the state's \"opportunity youth\" population \u2014 according to the New Orleans report. Additionally, lower educational attainment and work experience are risk factors for future poverty.\nThe final New Orleans GBI results are based on interviews and surveys with participants about their experience, as well as quantitative spending data. Participants were surveyed at the beginning of the pilot, the halfway point, the end of the pilot, and five months after their payments ended. The pilot had no control group.\nSome pilot participants said they weren't previously able to maintain jobs or school attendance due to caregiving responsibilities at home. But, with GBI, many participants said they were able to provide financial support to their grandparents, parents, or siblings.\n\"We recognize that, when you meet people where they're at, they actually do rise to the occasion,\" Asya Howlette, director of the New Orleans Mayor's Office of Youth and Families, told BI.\nParticipants also had a statistically significant increase in full-time employment: Between the beginning and end of the program, the participants' employment rate increased from 6% to 21%, and many reported feeling more income stable. Some said the $350 gave them the financial freedom to pursue training programs and internships.\nThe number of participants who had a housing cost burden exceeding 50% of their income \u2014 which is considered heavily rent-burdened \u2014 also declined by 15 percentage points over the course of the pilot.\nA few hundred dollars a month likely doesn't cover major expenses, but Howlette said it's what many opportunity youth need to get by.\n\"It's not enough to propel you into wealth,\" she said. \"It is enough to keep you from the precipice of disaster.\"\nParticipants struggle to pay bills after payments end\nEven with employment and financial gains, many of the benefits that participants felt from guaranteed basic income were temporary. New Orleans' pilot was short-term, and participants' feelings of hopelessness increased after payments ended.\nOverall, participants did not experience a significant boost in mental health, physical health, or the ability to build savings between the beginning and end of the pilot. Despite the monthly income, many still struggled to afford food and pay utility bills.\nResearchers, however, noted that the individualized impacts of guaranteed basic income are difficult to capture in a dataset. Program leaders like Howlette said it's important to pay attention to anecdotes, not just numerical trends \u2014 because participants' needs and experiences vary.\nThe report identified high costs of living, low wages, and poor economic conditions in the aftermath of the pandemic as factors that might have hindered participants' finances. While many safety net programs exist for children and adults, very few serve teenagers.\nFor Howlette, the New Orleans pilot results show that housing, work, and transportation-related costs are major barriers for opportunity youth. She said guaranteed income is just one way to help alleviate these challenges and prevent long-term poverty.\n\"If you're anti-guaranteed income, then you need to be pro-affordable housing, access to transit, access to work, and higher wages,\" she said. \"People have to survive in this world, and if our economy is not making it possible, then we are left with people who are struggling to survive.\"\nHave you benefited from a guaranteed basic income program?

      "text": "- Business Insider asked bar professionals about the drinks wealthy customers are actually ordering.\n- Luxury spirits seem to be popular among the affluent crowds at high-end spots.\n- The bartenders also said people order individual pours that sometimes cost $400.\nEven though cocktail prices across the board have been on the rise, that hasn't stopped specialty drinks \u2014 like $40 martinis \u2014 from becoming a new kind of status symbol.\nBut what are the wealthy drinking right now? It turns out what's in their cups ranges from three-figure pours to mocktails with fresh herbs.\nTo peel back the curtain on how the other half lives, Business Insider asked bartenders and beverage directors at high-end restaurants, bars, and catering companies which drinks the upper class is ordering right now.\nSpirit-forward cocktails are extremely popular.\nTyler Ledbetter, a bar manager for TH/RST Hospitality Group, told BI one of the major trends among its biggest spenders is spirit-forward cocktails.\nPopular examples include old-fashioneds, martinis, and Negronis \u2014 but upgraded with higher-end spirits. Since they're usually the stars of these drinks, quality matters.\n\"These spirits are a little pricier because they have so much flavor complexity, and in a spirit-forward cocktail, this taste comes through more so than a fruity cocktail like a margarita,\" he said.\nThe bar manager highlighted Macallan single-malt Scotch, Blanton's bourbon, and Don Julio 1942 tequila as spirits to watch.\nSingle pours are also more common than you may think.\nCarlos Ruiz, a bartender and mixologist at Le Malt Imperiale, said many patrons at his private social dining club in New York City opt for single pours.\nHe told BI that Pappy Van Winkle 12-year bourbon and Macallan 25 are popular top-priced items that cost $200 and $400 a pour, respectively.\nEspresso martinis are popular for a reason.\nHailey Knight, the beverage director at F\u00e9lix Cocktail et Cuisine, said espresso martinis have won and maintained their status as a trendy signature cocktail for affluent customers.\n\"Its adaptability to different settings and times of day adds to its appeal,\" she told BI. \"The caffeine is also appealing in social settings to stay energized during evening events or after dinner.\"\nClassic cocktails with a luxury twist are becoming a fan favorite.\nWhen it comes to cocktails, the elite may still gravitate toward classic bar staples \u2014 but with a luxurious twist.\nWill Kriebel, the head bartender at Chelsea Living Room in NYC, said he serves plenty of dry martinis with blue-cheese-whipped olives. Some customers even splurge on a caviar-stuffed upgrade.\nHe said going out for drinks isn't just an activity, it's an experience \u2014 and people are looking to be impressed by new combinations.\nCaviar has become a popular drink garnish \u2014 for those who can afford it.\nHector Maneiro, a bartender at Only Love Strangers in New York, told BI that caviar \u2014 yes, fish eggs \u2014 has become the ultimate cocktail garnish.\n\"For the wealthy, it's a way to showcase their discerning taste and appreciation for the finer things in life,\" he said. But it can also pair well with some types of alcohol.\n\"We use classic Ossetra caviar for our martini because of its delicate, nutty flavor and buttery texture, which complements the clean flavors of gin or vodka perfectly,\" Maneiro told BI.\nA quality, 1-ounce tin of Ossetra caviar typically costs at least $100. But when the bar is shouldering the up-front cost and using it as a drink garnish, customers can enjoy the delicacy for a fraction of the price.\nDrinks with quality, locally sourced ingredients are highly sought after.\nNancy Parragu\u00e9 Barclay, a partner and vice president of client relations at Paula LeDuc Fine Catering & Events, said she's had more high-profile clients requesting farm-to-table drinks incorporating fresh herbs and locally sourced ingredients.\n\"Incorporating seasonal ingredients offers fresher, more distinctive flavors compared to mass-produced alternatives, making this a more artisanal experience,\" she told BI.\nParragu\u00e9 Barclay said this movement toward local, fresh ingredients is part of a larger trend and generational shift. Gen Z, sometimes referred to as the Sustainable Generation, has demanded more attention for environmental concerns in recent years \u2014 and that stretches into the beverage industry.\nChoosing cocktails made with local ingredients can help reduce carbon emissions since they don't have to be shipped as far.\nLow-ABV cocktails are also on the rise.\nFrankie Gabriel, the director of restaurants for TH/RST Hospitality Group's Sweetbriar in the Park South Hotel, told BI that mocktails and drinks with lower alcohol content have been a steady trend among their customers in the past few years.\nThey're popular for those trying to gradually go completely alcohol-free and individuals who just want a lighter aperitif, like Le Mon\u00e9.\n\"Drinking an aromatic spritz in the sunshine has taken the place of a scotch and cigar in a basement,\" he told BI.\nLedbetter said many of his customers have been particularly interested in Hugo spritzes with St-Germain elderflower liqueur, muddled mint, and prosecco or Limoncello spritzes with the Italian lemon liqueur and prosecco."

      "text": "- Fall can bring a surge in hiring, but a drop in available jobs could jeopardize big gains.\n- Unemployment remains low, but job openings in the US are at their lowest since early 2021.\n- Some employers are cautious, though one recruiter said he was seeing an uptick among startups.\nThe September surge might turn out to be a sputter.\nIn years past, hiring has often picked up in the fall as vacations wind down and some companies look to staff up heading into a busy holiday season.\nBut for some people hoping to land a job in the final stretch of 2024, it's proving tricky.\nJohn Mullinix, the head of growth marketing at the job site Ladders, told Business Insider that in areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, and construction, there were fewer openings than some labor market experts had forecast.\n\"In a lot of those industries, there were predicted gains. They seem to be slowing down, and that's creating fewer job openings,\" he said.\nAlready, job openings in the US are hovering at their lowest level since early 2021, and many employers are taking their time bringing on new people. While that sluggish pace of hiring is making the fall feel less robust than in some years, Mullinix said there are steps job seekers can take to stand out.\nThat's welcome news because a job search can drag on for many months. In fact, the number of job seekers who get their next role within three months is down 14% in 2024 compared with 2022, according to Live Data Technologies, which provides real-time employment figures.\nMullinix said some employers were shifting to contract and freelance work to avoid taking on the cost of a full-time worker who would get benefits.\nOf course, the overall unemployment rate remains low, and there are still areas where employers can't find the talent they need. Plus, parts of the economy could further heat up, particularly after the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates for the first time in four years following an effort to stamp out high inflation.\nStartups could give a boost\nAtli Thorkelsson, who helps startups recruit at the venture-capital firm Redpoint Ventures, told BI he expected startup hiring to be \"pretty active\" for the second half of 2024.\n\"I'm hearing a lot from recruiting firms that they're super busy,\" he said, adding, \"I'm seeing an uptick in search requests coming from our founders as well.\"\nThorkelsson said that hiring at startups began to pick up last September and that for many small companies, growth was cautious but notable in terms of demand for people.\nYet, in other corners of the economy, employers' wariness is winning out \u2014 for now. That's causing some to list fewer job openings.\n\"Companies are being more cautious,\" Mullinix said.\nOne challenge is that with fewer openings, the number of applicants per role can stack up, he said. That can make it harder for job seekers, of course, and for recruiters who have to sift through a pile of applications. Big companies in particular tend to use software to sort r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Mullinix noted that a high number of applicants can lead to some tough decisions.\nHe said recruiters were \"screening a little bit harder so they don't have to go through 1,000 applications,\" adding, \"Realistically, they wouldn't be able to do that in a day.\"\nAnd though the unemployment rate is low, that doesn't mean that only those without work are thumbing through job listings.\n\"Even the people that are currently in jobs are not happy with the jobs that they have,\" Mullinix said. He said inflation had left some workers upset that their wages weren't always keeping up with expenses.\nNow, as people are staying in jobs longer than only a couple of years ago during the so-called Great Resignation, some of them are getting antsy, he said.\n\"The problem is you have job seekers that are both employed and then unemployed, searching at the same time in a market where the supply is down and the demand is up,\" Mullinix said.\nThat's especially true for high-paying jobs, he said.\nDon't shotgun it, but don't hold back too much\nMullinix said it's possible to apply to both too many jobs and not enough. He said the bulk approach of going for every job that can be applied for with a single click often isn't as effective because so many people end up vying for the same role.\nInstead, he said it's wise to be more deliberate and choose the ones you might be best qualified for. He also recommended doing the tedious work of filling out applications that involve more than just one click. That often means wading through clunky software interfaces.\n\"That's the same process everybody else has to go through,\" he said. \"That's going to cut out some candidates right there, and that's going to be a less competitive job.\"\nAnd even if the job title in a posting is different from one you've had before, it's often still a good idea to apply if you have the right skills and qualifications, Mullinix said.\n\"Companies name things 100 different ways,\" he said.\nMullinix said that given how unpleasant the search process can be, it's understandable that job seekers would gravitate toward the easiest method for applying.\n\"Online job seeking is just not the most fun activity,\" he said, noting that it tends to rank poorly in surveys. \"It's pretty much next to being divorced on a scale of enjoyability.\"\nDo you have something to share about what you're seeing in the workplace or in your job search?

      "text": "For decades, students have donned costumes and flocked the streets among thousands of out-of-town visitors to wander from party to party and witness the flood of pedestrians, police and paramedics on Halloween weekend.\n\u201cPeople think of [Isla Vista and Halloween] as something that\u2019s been around since the beginning of time,\u201d Adrienne MacIan, a UCSB Ph.D. student who wrote her 2006 dissertation on Halloween in Isla Vista, said.\nOnly 23 percent of those polled on the Daily Nexus website correctly answered the question \u201cWhen do you think Halloween in IV became a renowned event?\u201d with \u201cIn the late \u201870s/early \u201880s.\u201d Despite the perception of Halloween as a long-standing tradition, it was not always similar to the wild event of the past three decades.\nThe Predecessors\n\u201c[Isla Vista as we know it] wasn\u2019t there until the University moved out there and [Halloween] didn\u2019t become what it was today until the late \u201860s,\u201d MacIan said.\nUC Santa Barbara was not located at its current site until 1954 and, in fact, the first huge Halloween bash connected to a UC campus was not at UCSB, but instead at UC Berkeley.\nCal held an annual \u201cAll Cal\u201d event on Halloween weekend. According to a 1954 article by El Gaucho\u2019s Christy Lord, students from around the state flocked to the event, which included football games between UC teams and a massive bonfire at the Cal Greek Amphitheatre.\nHowever, despite its popularity among students, references to \u201cAll Cal\u201d in El Gaucho ended by the mid-\u201860s.\nUCSB\u2019s own predecessor to Halloween was a Homecoming celebration in the fall, which, according to MacIan, included the crowning of a Homecoming Queen and a bonfire rally. The event waned after moving the parade location from State Street in downtown Santa Barbara to Isla Vista in 1968, and the event ended entirely when the football team was disbanded in 1971 due to budget cuts.\nThe First of Halloween\nThe initial signs of mayhem were reported in 1962 when, according to a 1965 El Gaucho article, \u201cthere was a \u2026 disturbance between two dormitory living groups involving water balloons and mud-clot throwing.\u201d\nRiotous conduct was reported in 1963 as well.\n\u201cStudents entered a women\u2019s residence hall, knocked down the housemother and poured through the building,\u2019\u201d Captain Willis A. Lowe said in the article. \u201cStudents also gathered in groups of hundreds on street corners.\u201d\nIn Isla Vista: A Citizen\u2019s History, Carmen Lodise said the first of the more modern Halloween parties also began to spring up around that time.\n\u201cStarting sometime in the 1960s, locals began dressing up and attending keg parties along Del Playa Drive,\u201d he said.\nHowever, according to MacIan, Halloween reports are strangely absent from the Nexus and other Santa Barbara community papers from 1966 until the late \u201870s \u2014 a testament that the celebration was not a news-worthy event until 1978.\n\u201cNineteen-seventy has been the most startlingly controversial year in UCSB history,\u201d said the La Cumbre yearbook that year. With the dawn of the 1970s came escalating political tension at the university.\n\u201cDel Playa Becomes a Halloween Riot.\u201d\nThe infamous burning of the Isla Vista Bank of America building in February 1970 added to the general sense of unrest felt across the nation.\nIn a 1988 interview printed in the Isla Vista Free Press, then-sociology professor Dick Flacks discussed the political climate.\n\u201cWhat happened [in I.V.] was that there was some kind of mass release from that need to suppress the rebellion,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen thousands of people are marching in defiance of authority, suddenly you become \u2018authorized\u2019 to reel against that authority, to express those buried feelings. And, there was an emotional, psychological release in expressing them, especially with a whole lot of other people expressing them, too.\u201d\nThe Isla Vista Foot Patrol was created in the fall of 1970 in response to the revolutionary behavior in the area.\n\u201cThe Foot Patrol was designed as a solution to the specific problems Isla Vista was experiencing in the wake of the 1970 civil disturbances \u2014 problems, some said, that were directly associated with the lack of community relations between police and students,\u201d Andrew Shulman wrote in a 1988 issue of the Isla Vista Free Press.\nTension mounted until 1978, when students recognized Halloween as an opportunity to strike out against authority.\nOn October 30, the Daily Nexus\u2019 front page headline read \u201cDel Playa Party Becomes a Halloween Riot.\u201d According to the article, a party of approximately 600 revelers turned violent when two officers on bicycles were pelted with bottles from a balcony and subsequently entered the residence. Of the 18 arrested, seven were UCSB students.\nAmidst the confusion, there were scattered reports of police brutality. A Nexus reporter noted that she allegedly saw an officer grab a female passenger out of a vehicle by her hair before slamming her against a cop car.\nThe next year, locals seized another chance for rebellion.\nThe Nexus\u2019 headline on October 31, 1979 read, \u201cCalm Halloween Reported to IVCC,\u201d but, in reality, a riot of an entirely different nature broke out. Unlike the 1978 riot, which began spontaneously, posters announcing a staged riot were distributed throughout SBCC and local high schools. According to MacIan, the perpetrators of the riot that transpired consisted of mostly high school students, copy-cats of the year before.\nDue to the obvious placement of the posters, police were able to plan for the events and the riot was quickly shut down.\n\u201cThe Golden Years:\u201d 1980-1985\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the \u201880s that Isla Vista became a destination for Halloween. The reason for it is still a mystery,\u201d MacIan said. \u201cNobody can tell for sure why going to Isla Vista for Halloween became so popular, except for those [1978 and \u201879] riots \u2026 Rumor of the riots spread and people wanted to see what was going on there.\u201d\nIn November of 1980, the Nexus\u2019 Jonathan Alburger wrote, \u201cUnlike the \u2018mini riots\u2019 which marked the last two years of celebration in the Del Playa area, Friday\u2019s procession of costumed students handled themselves without any major incident\u2026\u201d\nFrom 1980 onward, the number of attendees began steadily increasing by approximately 1,000 attendees every year until 1985 \u2014 when the number spiked to 10,000.\nMichelle Morgante, who attended UCSB from 1985 to 1991 and worked as a Nexus news editor, said her Halloween weekends were always positive, despite the growing crowds.\n\u201cIt was a blast and I lived on D.P. for three years, so I had a great location for the whole scene,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had live bands playing everywhere and keg parties were very common. Everyone just kind of wandered the streets with their plastic cup listening to great music.\u201d\n\u201cAll Hell Broke Loose in 1986\u2026\u201d\nThe 1986 Halloween weekend marked the first time that the open container ordinance was enforced, which prohibited anyone from carrying open alcohol in public.\n\u201cYou had to carry your cup upside down when you were walking in the street \u2026 People learned how to deal with it,\u201d Morgante said.\nDespite the new restriction, that year saw a record-breaking number of attendees. \u201cAll hell broke loose in 1986 when over 30,000 people showed up, literally thousands arriving in a fleet of chartered busses from San Diego State University,\u201d Lodise wrote. \u201cThe cops busted over 1,000 persons that weekend, nearly three-fourths from SDSU.\u201d\nWith the rise in Halloween attendees, came a rise in criminal activity.\n\u201cA female UCSB student who thought she had been hit by flying rocks went three days with a bullet in her chest before discovering that she had been shot,\u201d according to an Office of Student Life administrative file.\nThat same year, a 26 year-old male sustained multiple stab wounds to the chest and two others fell off the bluffs.\nDue to the unprecedented attendance in 1986, the university recognized a need to reduce the number of out-of-towners. In 1987, UC officials launched the first \u201cDon\u2019t Come to I.V.\u201d campaign at other California campuses.\nThe county also leapt into action by commissioning traffic control to restrict the volume of out-of-towners. Cars rushed to the area on Friday but, by 8 p.m., the area was closed to incoming traffic and students were directed to park on campus or Hollister Road.\nRegardless, Nexus and A.S. records show that 35,000 still managed to find their way onto the streets.
