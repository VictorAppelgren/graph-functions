  "title": "The Totem Compass Can Help You Find Your Friends at a Festival\u2014No Phone Service Required",
  "description": "Stuck at a festival with no reception? To find your group, just look down.",
  "content": "I attend a minimum of 3 EDM festivals every year, and they all have one thing in common: There\u2019s no phone service anywhere. It\u2019s almost a meme at this point. Trying to send a text message at a festival will have you walking around with your phone in the air, praying that it\u2019ll send. Don\u2019t even think about trying a phone call\u2014it\u2019ll fail every time. It\u2019s gotten to the point where my friends and I started time-stamping our text messages: \u201cI\u2019m at the Forest Stage, 2:42 pm.\u201d\n\nThe Totem Compass is the solution.\n\nThis device uses the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and its own Unity Mesh Network to help track down your friends even if your phone has no cell service or Wi-Fi (a problem that other trackers like AirTags can't yet overcome). Once it\u2019s set up, it\u2019ll point you to the directional heading of your other Totem-wielding pals.\n\nTotems, also known as doof sticks, are part of festival culture\u2014especially when it comes to bass music. People hold giant signs attached to a pole to help their friends find them in a crowd. No phone service? Just look for the poster of Pikachu puking lasers, or Shaq (AKA DJ Diesel) requesting a mosh pit, and boom: You\u2019ve found your group. But totems are annoying (no totems at Tipper!) and cumbersome, and sometimes are banned from festival grounds.\n\nThe viral Totem Compass works similarly, except that instead of looking for a meme or colorful sign, you\u2019ll just look down.\n\nEach Totem compass is a little 2.3-inch plastic puck with a glowing \u201cTouch Crystal\u201d plastic gem in the middle and a ring of lights surrounding it. There are two buttons on the back: A power button and a slightly recessed SOS button. Setting it up is \u2026 tricky, honestly. There are a lot of features to navigate and lights to figure out. But there\u2019s a user guide that helps speed the process along. You\u2019ll charge it up via USB-C, power it on and update the firmware, and then take it outside so it can find a satellite to connect to. You\u2019ll also have to calibrate it by spinning around in a circle a few times. It comes with two lanyards, but there are a few accessories available as separate purchases, like carabiner loops and necklace chains.",

      "text": "Donald Bump, Ketmist Warehouse, Kit Ket, 13CAPS, Rack It Ralph. If you\u2019ve spent longer than 24 hours partying to dance music in Australia, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve seen one of these phrases or images plastered on a piece of corflute and encircled by fairy lights above your head on the dancefloor.\nOriginally, the doof stick was an incredible idea as long as it remained a somewhat well-kept secret. A modern form of medieval heraldry, the handheld beacon in a huge crowd of festivalgoers would make it infinitely easier to find your friends post-piss(ex)cursion or in the midst of the Sisyphean refilling of water bottles. If only a blown up Officeworks printed picture of Darren, the 20-year-old \u201ccertified legend\u201d who got COVID and couldn\u2019t make it, was a little more subtle and less imitable.\nVideos by VICE\nBut what started as a fun and rare sight at music festivals a little over a decade ago, has become a plague of clutter, littering the crowd\u2019s view of the stage and burdening clean up crews.\nDoof sticks are, unsurprisingly, almost an entirely Australian thing. One only has to take a look at pictures of any international festival to notice the distinct lack of them. And the almost global bias against them is understandable.\nAside from the clear obstruction to any stage view, the safety hazard they present and the waste they create, doof sticks are another outlet for the worst of Australia\u2019s sense of \u201chumour\u201d.\nDoof sticks are usually one of three things:\n- A real-world company or product logo or catchphrase turned into a drug pun\n- A celebrity, pop culture figure or character turned into a drug pun, or,\n- A picture of a person, clearly on drugs\nSure, some are genuinely hilarious and involve real creativity and effort. Maybe they\u2019re part of a group costume or simply an impressive feat of engineering. But is being unapologetically stupid a replacement for actual culture?\nDance music, festivals and \u201cpartying\u201d have always been an avenue for escape from the perils and mundanity of the world around us. But partying has also always been political.\nThese days, however, apathy is so pervasive we chase numbness and use humour all too often to gloss over the outside world. We live in a time where k-holing can act as a chaser to the Welcome to Country. Is a picture of a politician or oppressive dictator with a spoon up his nose meant to be \u2026 funny? Worthwhile?\nAs an event organiser myself, it\u2019s a relief never to see the things on dancefloors I facilitate. Granted, it\u2019s not hard to find your friends in a crowd of several hundred, but there\u2019s a creeping air of naff that seems to grip the nostrils of punters the second a doof stick is in sight.\nFor me, my concern isn\u2019t around the view of the DJ or artists as much as it is about the glorification of drug use. Sure, people take drugs, I get it, but being drug fucked on a dancefloor is, in my opinion, the worst thing for it and the people on it.\nAll the digital fist-shaking in the world likely can\u2019t do a damn thing about our drug culture, and kids will be kids. But maybe if the dancefloor was as sacred, respected and revered here as it was in other parts of the world, I wouldn\u2019t have to prop up some munted 20-year-old and his staff as I try to enjoy the music.\nFollow Jack Colquhoun on Instagram.\nRead more from VICE Australia and subscribe to our weekly newsletter, This Week Online."

      "text": "When you step foot into any music festival or large event, one of the first things to go is your cell phone service. It\u2019s a tale as old as time (or at least, as old as cell phones).\nMajor venues (particularly outdoor venues in cool locations) are plagued with unreliable cell service because of extreme network congestion and the increased distance from cell phone towers. Phone towers can only support so many active phone users in an area at once, and large events quickly reach a tipping point where nearby towers simply can\u2019t handle the congestion.\nIf you lose your friends in the crowd at one of these events, things can get intense really quickly. In addition to unreliable service, you can\u2019t always depend on your friends to check their phones consistently. The last thing anyone wants to do at a music festival is have to constantly check their phone. It\u2019s a universal headache felt by so many festival and event-goers around the world.\nThe Totem Compass is designed to give people freedom at music festivals and live events. Freedom to roam, freedom to dance. Freedom from fear and uncertainty.\nThe beauty of the Totem Compass is that it works without cell-service, Wi-Fi, or bluetooth. Once you bond the Totem Compass with your friends, the Totem uses GNSS, a peer-to-peer (P2P) connectionless communication protocol, and our Unity Mesh Network\u2122 to keep you connected. These three technologies come together to allow you to find your friends no matter how thick the crowds get.\n(Check out our blog post for a deep dive on how the Totem Compass works.)\nOne of the most important aspects of our revolutionary technology is the Unity Mesh Network\u2122. The Unity Mesh Network extends the range of any Totem Compass at music festivals and brings all Totem users together in a virtuous circle of mutual aid. It allows you to locate and connect with your friends across very large distances at festivals\u2014no cell service required.\nThis blog will cover the basics of mesh networks, what makes the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 unique from other mesh networks, and will break down exactly how it helps people feel safe and free.\nQuick Primer on Mesh Networks\nA mesh network is a network where devices create connection points, also called nodes, that are linked together.\nMesh networks can use two processes to transfer information between nodes: data flooding and data routing. To understand how the Totem\u2019s mesh network functions, we\u2019ll focus on data routing. With data routing, information bounces from node to node before reaching its final destination.\nThe beauty of data routing is that it is dynamic and has the ability to self-heal. Each node can choose the path it takes based on efficiency, speed, and security, and can reconfigure the network in the event of a broken path or missed connection.\nMesh networks are different from conventional networks\nMany conventional networks operate with a star-like pattern of connections. This means that every device, or node, within the network is connected to a central hub. This central hub is the single source of truth, used to transmit information to every node in the network.\nMesh networks differ from other networks by forming a web-like pattern of connections between nodes. Mesh networks allow information to be shared without the need for a central hub or server\u2014super useful for a music festival!\nThe Mesh Network everyone knows\nThe first, and perhaps oldest, example of a mesh network is\u2026.drumroll\u2026.the Internet itself! Information passes through the Internet from router to router (or node) until it reaches its final destination.\nOther recognizable examples of a mesh network include Amazon Sidewalk, a shared network that allows all Echo devices to communicate with each other and work faster within and outside your home. Google Nest Wi-Fi does something very similar.\nThe Unity Mesh Network\u2122\nThe Unity Mesh Network\u2122 is meticulously designed with music festival and outdoor event settings in mind. It exists to overcome a very specific problem: connecting with your friends in large, congested crowds.\nWhat makes the Unity Mesh Network special?\nThe Unity Mesh Network\u2122 is a peer-to-peer network, meaning that it is designed specifically for peer-to-peer communication devices, such as Totem\u2019s festival compass. Not all mesh networks are designed this way. Peer-to-peer mesh networks come with some awesome benefits:\n- Offline communication: no cell service or internet required.\n- Free data: the only cost is hardware. Information can travel across devices at no cost to you.\n- Privacy: because data is stored locally, third-party infringement becomes less of an issue.\nThe Unity Mesh Network\u2122 is designed by festival-goers, for festival-goers. So much energy goes into planning and coordinating with friends in the event of unreliable service at crowded festivals. With the Totem Compass, you can leave your phone at home. Wild, right?\nThe Unity Mesh Network is clutch because it can give you boundless range at most festivals if there is a certain amount of users at your festival (1-2% or more of attendees).\nEach Totem Compass acts as a potential node in the Unity Mesh Network\u2122. The beauty of the mesh network is that information hops across Totems as you move through different areas of an outdoor venue, until the location information of a peer reaches your Totem Compass. This means that whenever there are three or more Totems at a festival, every additional Totem can act as a bridge between you and your friend, effectively extending your range.\nThe same thing applies with fluctuating crowds. Say, for example, you\u2019re at a music festival and a set has just ended. The crowd disperses but you still need to find a friend. If just one or two people in that area have Totem Compasses, the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 will use their Totems to pass information from your friend\u2019s Totem until it arrives to you.\nA Tribe of Unity and Love\nWhen you bond your Totem Compass with your friends, you have a way to stay connected with and support your \u201ctribe\u201d of friends.\nThe beauty of the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 is that it connects to a larger Tribe of beautiful people around you. This applies especially at larger, more densely-packed festivals.\nEvery person with a Totem Compass, even if they aren\u2019t bonded to you, helps pass information along to help you find your friends. With the Unity Mesh Network\u2122, there\u2019s always a larger Totem Tribe helping you stay connected with the people you love. You, in turn, also help those around you simply by being a member of the Totem Tribe.\nThe Unity Mesh Network\u2122 unifies everyone into a larger group of love that helps the people within it\u2014because we\u2019re all in this together. At Totem, we believe in unity. Humanity shines brightest when we stand together. That\u2019s why we named it the Unity Mesh Network\u2122.\nHow the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 works\nThe Unity Mesh Network\u2122 is layered on top of a peer-to-peer connectionless communication protocol. This peer-to-peer protocol allows any two Totem Compasses to track each other at a range of around 1000 meters.\nSome people have interpreted this to mean that the range of the Totem Compass maxes out around 1000 meters, but that is a misunderstanding of the technology. The true maximum range for most real-world use cases goes far beyond 1000 meters.\nIt\u2019s true that the peer-to-peer range maxes out around 1000 meters, but that is only relevant if you and your one friend are the only two people at the whole festival with Totems. Incredibly unlikely, as this is a global movement with members around the world.\nOnce there is a third person in the festival area with a Totem Compass, the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 will kick in and start helping extend the range of the Totem Compasses well beyond 700 meters. In other words, the peer-to-peer maximum range of ~1000 meters is not the true maximum range of a Totem Compass in most situations. The Unity Mesh Network has the power to extend the range of the Totem Compasses across the boundaries of the festival or live event venue.\nHow does the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 extend the range of the Totem Compass?\nThe Unity Mesh Network uses a data routing method to transfer information between Totem Compasses. If you are trying to find a peer and they are more than 1000 meters away from you, the location of your friend will hop across other Totem Compasses in the area between you and your peer until it reaches your Totem.\nFor example, say you\u2019re at Burning Man. On average, 75,000 people attend Burning Man every year. If even 2% of Burners have Totem Compasses (1,500 people), the signal range of your Totem Compass can extend across the entire area depending on how those 1,500 people are distributed across the grounds.\nOne amazing thing about the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 is that it is highly intelligent. The network can choose the easiest, fastest route to deliver a peer\u2019s location to your Totem Compass. It also comes equipped with self-healing algorithms that will automatically reconfigure the network to fix signal dropoffs, dead zones, and blocked or broken paths.\nWill people be able to use the mesh network to follow me home?\nThe Totem Compass is designed to make it nearly impossible for anyone to follow you home after the event. Because the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 relies on other Totems to communicate, when the festival disbands, the mesh network disappears. At that point, the max range reverts to the peer-to-peer range of around 1000 meters.\nOnce you get in your car or rideshare vehicle at the end of the night, you will quickly get out of range of anyone else who bonded with your compass. This means that the only way someone could track you after the festival is if you keep your compass on, and if they stay within 1000 meters of you during your entire trip.\nUnity Mesh Network\u2122 in Action\nIt\u2019s story time! Let\u2019s put the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 to use in a real-world situation.\nWho\u2019s ready for a trip to EDC???\nAn Epic Trip to EDC Orlando\nA group of three friends arrive at EDC Orlando. One of the three (Dan), is a music festival veteran (aka Rave Dad). Dan = Dad. The other two friends, Carla and Joey, are new to the music festival scene (aka Rave Babies).\nDan, Carla and Joey walk through the gates and immediately start feeling the bass ripple through their bones from MainStage. The rave babies start getting excited (and a little overwhelmed) so Dan decides that now is a good time to bond their Totem Compasses.\nAfter they bond, Dan suggests they see the first show together to kick off Day 1 as a unified Tribe. The trio heads to ISOxo at MainStage.\nThe Opener: Peer-to-Peer Navigation\nHalfway through the first set, all three friends are covered in sweat, dripping with unadulterated glee as they shuffle to the beats. Carla realizes she\u2019s drained her hydro-pack, and Dan suddenly needs to use the restroom. Joey, meanwhile, is totally absorbed in the melodic synesthesia and wants to stay in the crowd.\nBecause the MainStage area has bathrooms and a water station nearby (less than 1000 meters away), Carla and Dan are able to easily find their way back to Joey without tapping into the mesh network around them. Joey is still so lost in the vibes that he barely notices they left.\nEarly Evening: Inner Tribe Mesh Networking\nEarly evening rolls around, and the Tribe decides to split up. Dan wants to recharge before the late-night festivities and decides to relax at the VIP lounge (because he\u2019s experienced\u2014EDC is a marathon, not a sprint). Carla really wants to see Kygo, while Joey has been waiting all year to see Excision. Both sets start at the exact same time on different sides of the festival.\nSo they make a plan: Carla will meet-up with Joey at the tail-end of Excision, and then they will go reunite with Dan at the VIP lounge. Carla and Joey can track Dan easily, as the VIP lounge is located between the Kygo and Excision stages and well within the peer-to-peer range (~1000 meters).\nCarla and Joey head to their different stages. When they get there, they are over 1000 meters away from each other, but their Totems can still track each other easily.\nBecause Dan is located between the two stages, his Totem Compass can pass along Joey\u2019s heading to Carla so that she can find him at the end of Excision\u2019s set. Dan helps Carla and Joey get accurate headings at all times\u2014all while laying in a lounge chair, sipping water and delightedly fanning himself. The pair eventually meet up with Dave and make a plan for the headlining show.\nThe Headliner: Unity Mesh Network\u2122 in all its Glory\nIt\u2019s now time for the headliners, and Joey really wants to see Chase & Status. Carla and Dan aren\u2019t huge fans of drum & bass, so they decide to see John Summit instead.\nAt this point in the evening, EDC Orlando is bursting at the seams with festival-goers, and the two stages are about a half-mile apart. As they wade through the crowds of people, the trio notices that they aren\u2019t the only ones at EDC Orlando with Totem Compasses. The Totem Vibe has spread to other tribes!\nBoth sets are absolute bangers. Carla and Dan are left reeling after John Summit, and Joey has just had the best side quest of his life (so far).\nWhen the shows end, Carla and Dan use their Totem Compasses to easily find Joey in the crowd\u2014thanks to everyone else at EDC Orlando with Totems. The complete expression of the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 allows everyone to help each other in their time of need.\nThe group reunites, exchanging hugs and wild stories, before heading out to get a few hours of sleep before Day 2.\nThus, our little happy Rave Family got happily lost in the Vibes\u2014but not in the crowds. \ud83d\ude42\nInspired by the Spirit of Community\nThe Unity Mesh Network\u2122 is advanced technology that the Totem Compass uses to extend its range beyond the boundaries of a festival or event venue.\nThe mesh network allows you to find your friends wherever you (and they) are, all while efficiently preserving battery life and frequency bandwidth. It provides peace of mind amidst massive crowds, thumping bass notes, and ther wild energy that fills music festivals and massive live events.\nMore than anything, the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 creates community. Every person with a rave compass within a festival or event space becomes part of a larger Tribe. Every person becomes completely capable of helping one another in their time of need. Every person becomes more loving, more unified\u2014simply by bringing their Totem to a music festival.\nThe Totem Compass weaves the Unity Mesh Network\u2122 into a synergy inspired by the music festival community. It was designed by festival-goers, for festival-goers. The Totem Compass is not only a testament to innovation, but also to the spirit of music festivals themselves \u2013 a tool designed to Bond, Find, and Vibe with your Tribe in a way that's never been done before."
