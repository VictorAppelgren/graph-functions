  "content": "WTF?! The US Air Force wants two Tesla Cybertrucks. The plan isn't to use them for transportation purposes, though; the EVs will be used for target practice. According to official documents, the trucks are a lot tougher than normal vehicles, meaning enemies are more likely to buy them \u2013 so the USAF wants to practice blowing them up.\n\nFederal contracting documents posted online by the US Air Force Material Command show that the military branch is looking for a supplier that can provide 33 towable target vehicles. They will be sent to White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico to support US Special Operations Command (SOCOM).\n\nAnother document shows that the Air Force wants two of these vehicles to be Tesla Cybertrucks. It explains that the enemy may transition to the EVs as they \"have been found not to receive the normal extent of damage upon major impact,\" presumably compared to the likes of Toyota Tacomas or Ford F-150s.\n\nTWZ writes that the target vehicles will be used to support SOCOM's Stand Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM) program and training. This covers several air-launched precision-guided munitions, so the Air Force is going to blow up the Cybertrucks and other vehicles by firing bombs and missiles at them, basically.\n\nThe Cybertrucks don't need to be in working condition \u2013 as long as they are able to be towed behind another vehicle, they'll suffice.\n\nThe document justifies the inclusion of Tesla's EVs by highlighting market research that concluded the Cybertruck's aggressively angular and futuristic design, paired with its unpainted stainless steel exoskeleton, sets it apart from competitors typically using painted steel or aluminum bodies. It also mentioned that the 48V electrical architecture provides superior power and efficiency, \"a feature that rivals are only beginning to develop.\"\n\nOne of the many claims that Elon Musk made about the \"apocalypse-proof\" Cybertruck is that it's bulletproof \u2013 the panels, not the windows. In March last year, YouTube channel JerryRigEverything, famed for the torture tests it carries out on phones, put this to the test by shooting the vehicle with a variety of weapons, ranging from a 9mm Glock 19 to a .50 cal rifle.\n\nIt was found that lower-velocity pistols struggled to do any significant damage to the truck, while larger-caliber rounds shredded through the doors and interior panels. One imagines it won't stand up well to being hit with a Hellfire missile.\n\nAccording to recent data, Tesla sold just 4,306 Cybertrucks in Q2 2025, marking a 50.8% decrease compared to the 8,755 vehicles that were sold during the same period in 2024. The company recently began accepting trade-ins for the vehicle, which were showing depreciation rates as bad as 34 percent after one year and 6,000 miles.",

      "text": "The U.S. Air Force is looking to buy two Tesla Cybertrucks for use as targets for precision munitions during testing and training. The service says it needs these vehicles for this purpose specifically because of the prospect of unspecified adversaries driving around in them in the future.\nThe Cybertrucks are among 33 target vehicles the Air Force Test Center (AFTC) is looking to acquire and have delivered to the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) in New Mexico, according to contracting documents recently posted online. WSMR is run by the U.S. Army, but the Air Force has a significant presence there. There are no name-brand requirements for the other sedans, bongo trucks, pickups, and SUVs, that are also on AFTC\u2019s shopping list. The primary intended use of all of the target vehicles is in support of U.S. Special Operations Command\u2019s (SOCOM) Stand Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM) program and related training. SOPGM covers multiple special operations-specific air-launched precision-guided munitions, including multiple variants of the AGM-114 Hellfire, the AGM-176 Griffin missile, the GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition (SGM), and the GBU-39B/B Laser Small Diameter Bomb (LSDB).\nThe explicit requirement for the Cybertrucks \u2013 which do not need to be in running condition but do need to be able to be roll towed behind another vehicle \u2013 requires a formal sole-source justification, a redacted copy of which is among the documents that AFTC has shared online.\n\u201cOn 13 February 2025, market research was conducted to assess the competition for the Tesla Cybertruck by evaluating its design, materials, impact resistance, and innovative technologies. The study revealed that the Cybertruck\u2019s aggressively angular and futuristic design, paired with its unpainted stainless steel exoskeleton, sets it apart from competitors typically using painted steel or aluminum bodies,\u201d the justification document explains. \u201cAdditionally, its 48V electrical architecture provides superior power and efficiency, a feature that rivals are only beginning to develop. Extensive internet searches and industry outreach by [redacted] found no vehicles with features comparable to those of the Cybertruck.\u201d\nMore importantly, \u201c[redacted] intends to uses [sic] specific Tesla manufactured vehicles for target vehicle training flight test events. In the operating theatre it is likely the type of vehicles used by the enemy may transition to Tesla Cyber trucks [sic] as they have been found not to receive the normal extent of damage expected upon major impact,\u201d it adds. \u201cTesting needs to mirror real world situations. The intent of the training is to prep the units for operations by simulating scenarios as closely as possible to the real world situations.\u201d\nThe document does not elaborate on the \u201coperating theatre\u201d or \u201cthe enemy\u201d in question, and TWZ has reached out to the Air Force for more information. Tesla effectively eliminated its public relations department years ago, but we have also reached out to its investor relations department for comment.\nAs of this spring, an estimated 46,000 Cybertrucks have been sold to date, though the exact number is unclear. Currently, Tesla only offers Cybertrucks for sale in North America, though examples have been exported elsewhere in the world. Tesla did announce in April that it was planning to start direct sales in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar before the end of the year.\nWithout more context, it is hard to say what may have prompted the belief that U.S. adversaries might soon be driving Cybertrucks. It is worth noting that the primary targets for SOCOM\u2019s SOPGM arsenal, at least as they are publicly known, have been terrorists and militants, especially ones riding in cars and trucks, in the Middle East, South and Central Asia, and parts of Africa.\nThe Cybertruck\u2019s windows and side panels have been shown to be bullet-resistant, stopping subsonic pistol caliber rounds, something that was heavily touted when the vehicle was first unveiled in 2019. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has described the vehicle, which has a retail price starting at around $80,000, as being \u201capocalypse-proof\u201d in the past. At the same time, the Cybertruck has been dogged by recalls, controversies, and criticism over its actual performance, features (or lack thereof), safety issues, build quality, ownership terms of service, and more. There have been reports this year of flagging sales.\nTWZ did previously lay out a detailed case for a militarized uncrewed version of the Cybertruck, which you can find here. Multiple companies are now offering Cybertrucks with add-on armor and other features aimed at prospective law enforcement, military, and private security customers.\nThere have been some sales of Cybertrucks to law enforcement agencies, including the Dubai Police. The U.S. State Department made headlines earlier this year over a possible purchase of Cybertrucks, a plan it subsequently said had been shelved indefinitely.\nLast year, Ramzan Kadyrov, the dictatorial head of Russia\u2019s semi-autonomous Chechen Republic, also showed off several Cybertrucks with 12.7mm machine guns mounted in the back and claimed to have sent some of them to join the fighting in Ukraine. How and where Kadyrov, who the U.S. government and others have sanctioned, acquired the vehicles is unclear. He later claimed that Tesla had remotely disabled at least one of them.\nWhat we do know is that the Air Force is looking to buy a pair of Cybertrucks to fire missiles and bombs at during testing and training events based on the possibility that American forces may encounter enemies driving them going forward.\nContact the author: joe@twz.com"
