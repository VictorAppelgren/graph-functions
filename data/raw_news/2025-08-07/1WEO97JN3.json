  "content": "is a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s Truth Social has launched a new AI search feature that consistently pushes conservative media sources. The feature, Truth Search AI, is powered by the AI startup Perlexity and is now available on the web version of Trump\u2019s social media platform, with public testing coming to the iOS and Android apps \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\nIn our testing, all of the source links that Truth Search AI cited were for conservative publications, including Fox News, Fox Business, The Washington Times, and The Federalist. The vast majority of these links directed users to articles published by Fox outlets, which suggests the Perplexity-powered search engine is limiting results to Trump-supporting media. That\u2019s despite Trump Media\u2019s self-proclaimed mission to \u201cend Big Tech\u2019s assault on free speech by opening up the Internet.\u201d\n\nA search for \u201cAre Trump\u2019s tariffs improving the economy?\u201d delivered five links to Fox Business, for example, with no other cited sources. The AI summaries are not always friendly to Trump, however. \u201cCurrent evidence indicates that Trump\u2019s tariffs have not improved the overall U.S. economy and are associated with a net negative effect, though some specific sectors benefit,\u201d Truth Search AI wrote in response.\n\nTruth CEO Devin Nunes said the feature will make the platform \u201can even more vital element in the Patriot Economy.\u201d The search tool is labeled as a beta for now. \u201cWe plan to robustly refine and expand our search function based on user feedback as we implement a wide range of additional enhancements to the platform,\u201d Nunes said.\n\n404 Media found bias with its own tests, too, reporting that Truth Search AI quickly dismissed that the president was criminally implicated with Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking activities when asked, \u201cIs Trump in the Epstein files?\u201d The bot did, however, say that Trump\u2019s tariffs have \u201cgenerally had a negative effect on economic growth and employment\u201d in the US.\n\nPerplexity\u2019s chief business officer, Dmitry Shevelenko, said the company is \u201cexcited\u201d to bring the company\u2019s AI to \u201can audience with important questions,\u201d promoting Perplexity as a tool for delivering \u201cdirect, reliable answers with transparent citations.\u201d\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",

Anyone using the browser version of Truth can now use Perplexity to search the web. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to partner with Perplexity to launch our public Beta testing of Truth Social AI, which will make Truth Social an even more vital element in the Patriot Economy,\u201d Devin Nunes, Trump Media's CEO and Chair of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, said in the press release.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Truth Social to bring powerful AI to an audience with important questions. Curiosity is the engine of change, and Perplexity\u2019s AI is developed to empower curiosity by delivering direct, reliable answers with transparent citations that allow anyone to dig deeper,\u201d Perplexity\u2019s chief business officer Dmitry Shevelenko said in the press release.\nAccording to the announcement, \u201cthe mission of Trump Media is to end Big Tech\u2019s assault on free speech by opening up the Internet and giving people their voices back.\u201d Which is a funny thing to put in an announcement about Trump partnering with a company whose investors include Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, and the former CEO of GitHub.\nPerplexity\u2019s Truth Social search engine will be powered by stolen content. Earlier this week, Cloudflare reported Perplexity used stealth and undeclared crawlers to evade websites that explicitly set themselves up to avoid being catalogued by LLMs. Perplexity has a long history of using scrapers that ignore the Robots Exclusion Protocol. Perplexity started as a demo that scraped Twitter with fake academic accounts backed by AI-generated research proposals.\nForbes, the New York Times, New York Post, and the Dow Jones have all accused Perplexity of plagiarism. News Corp\u2018s Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Post sued Perplexity in 2024 for copyright infringement, claiming in the federal lawsuit that Perplexity is \u201cengaging in a massive amount of illegal copying of publishers\u2019 copyrighted works and diverting customers and critical revenues away from those copyright holders.\u201d In 2024, WIRED reported on the accusations of Perplexity\u2019s plagiarism and Perplexity almost immediately plagiarized the story. When New York Times tech workers went on strike last year, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas offered to help the Times keep the paper going.\nBig Tech has aligned itself with the Trump administration since before the election, seeing an alliance of opportunity for deregulation of AI in particular.\nBut is the Perplexity-powered AI aggregation machine \u201cwoke?\u201d I asked a few questions to find out. I wanted to know: Is Trump in the Epstein files?\u201cThere is no evidence in the recently reviewed and released government \u2018Epstein Files\u2019 of a \u2018client list\u201d or documentation placing Donald Trump as implicated in Jeffrey Epstein's criminal actions,\u201d it said. \u201cWhile Trump\u2019s name, like many other prominent individuals, appears in public records of Epstein\u2019s social and business contacts (such as guest lists or flight logs, widely reported over the years), there is no mention in current official documents or filings that directly implicates Trump as a criminal participant in Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking activities.\u201d\nHow does Truth Social\u2019s search engine think the American economy is doing?\n\u201cThe American economy is currently facing significant headwinds, with signs of slowdown\u2014most notably by a contraction in GDP, rising inflation, and softening labor market conditions\u2014though some leaders still emphasize areas of resilience,\u201d Truth Search AI said.\nAre the tariffs to blame?\u201cRecent tariff increases in the United States have generally had a negative effect on economic growth and employment, raising costs for businesses and consumers while providing only limited benefits to some manufacturing sectors,\u201d Truth Search AI said.\nDamn. It\u2019s woke as hell."
