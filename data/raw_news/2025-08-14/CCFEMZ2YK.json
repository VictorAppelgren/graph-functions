  "title": "Feds seek death penalty for Seattle woman linked to cultlike 'Zizian' group murder",
  "description": "The filing represents one of the first examples of the Trump administration's push to more aggressively seek the death penalty.",
  "content": "Federal prosecutors are seeking to execute a Seattle woman accused of fatally shooting a U.S. Border Patrol agent in January, an incident tied to multiple other deaths linked to the cultlike \"Zizian\" group.\n\nIn an Aug. 14 court filing, Department of Justice attorneys said they are pursuing the death penalty for Theresa Youngblut for the murder of agent David Maland near the Canadian border in Vermont on Jan. 20. Border Patrol agents shot and killed Youngblut's companion during a confrontation that followed a traffic stop.\n\n\"We will not stand for such attacks on the men and women who protect our communities and our borders,\" acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti said in a statement announcing the decision.\n\nThe filing represents one of the first examples of the Trump administration's push to aggressively seek the death penalty in cases involving federal agents. Youngblut's attorneys previously argued they needed more time to prepare for a death-penalty case, but a judge said prosecutors could proceed.\n\nAccording to authorities, federal agents had been suspicious of Maland and her companion, Ophelia Bauckholt, for several days as they traveled around northern Vermont. Both were wearing tactical gear and openly carrying guns, which is legal but unusual in Vermont. Additionally Bauckholt, who was transgender, was visiting the United States on a visa from Germany, and was listed as a man on immigration paperwork. Federal officials continue to refer to Bauckholt as a man.\n\nIn a new indictment accompanying the death-penalty filing, federal officials said Border Patrol agents stopped Youngblut's Toyota Prius and were approaching the vehicle when she and Bauckholt got out. Youngblut began firing immediately, investigators said, and Bauckholt was killed before she could fire.\n\nThe confrontation between Youngblut and Border Patrol agents appears connected to a series of deaths nationwide related to the cultlike \"Zizan\" group, which is also being investigated in California, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. Earlier this year, a grand jury indicted the Zizian group's namesake, Jack \"Ziz\" LaSota, on weapons charges. And a man who Youngblut was planning to marry was arrested Jan. 24 in connection with the Jan. 17 slaying of a California landlord, according to court records.\n\nA longtime Vermont defense attorney familiar with the case previously told USA TODAY he believes Youngblut opened fire on the Border Patrol agents because she thought they knew about the California murder three days earlier. Federal prosecutors have not yet indicated what they believe motivated Youngblut.",

      "text": "3 arrested as probe intensifies into string of bizarre murders nationwide\nMaryland State police have arrested two people in connection with a string of homicides nationally, including several deaths in California, two in Pennsylvania and the shooting of a U.S. border patrol agent in Vermont earlier this year.\nTaken into custody were Jack \"Ziz\" Lasota, 34, and Michelle Zajko, 32. Authorities believe Zajko supplied the guns used in the shooting of Border Patrol agent David Maland near the Canadian border Jan. 20. Maryland State Police confirmed the arrests Monday but declined to comment further.\nA third person, Daniel Blank, 26 was arrested alongside Zajko and Lasota; his connection was not immediately clear. Maryland authorities did not immediately disclose the circumstances under which the three were arrested.\n\"The Maryland State Police is working in coordination with our federal law enforcement partners and the Office of the State's Attorney in Allegany County as this investigation continues,\" a spokesperson for the Maryland State Police said in a statement.\nThe FBI confirmed that agents were working with Maryland State Police but declined to comment further.\nThe cases have drawn worldwide attention, in part because some of the people involved were transgender and many were vegan, an unusual combination of circumstances, experts said.\nZajko is a suspect in the shooting deaths of her parents in Pennsylvania in late 2023. Authorities believe Lasota is leader of a small group of people that included Michelle Youngblut, 21, who has been charged in connection with Maland\u2019s death. Lasota and Zajko had been interviewed by police in connection with her parents' deaths, but they were not arrested or charged.\n\"There's significant evidence that Jack Lasota is the person who is the idea engine for these people,\" said Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow and policy adviser at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. \"There are certainly suspicions that need to be investigated.\"\nMaryland court records show Lasota faces charges of trespassing, obstruction and possession of a handgun in a vehicle. Zajko faces charges of trespassing, resisting or interfering with an arrest, obstruction and carrying a handgun. Blank faces charges of trespassing, obstruction and hindering, police said. All three were arrested in a rural area of Maryland near the Pennsylvania border, about 230 miles west of where Zajko's parents lived.\nAll three were due in court Tuesday, court records show. Blank was reported missing from Pennsylvania near where Zajko's parents lived on Dec. 15, 2022, according to Pennsylvania State Police.\nThough investigations have not yet publicly announced the specific connection between the deaths, court records and interviews indicate members of the group had lived in box trucks in California and North Carolina and operated like a small religious group calling themselves \u201cZizians,\u201d a reference to Lasota\u2019s preferred name.\nLasota may have faked his own death at one point; his hometown newspaper published an obituary for him in 2022. Online posts attributed to Lasota indicate he may have been transgender.\nJessica Taylor, who is friends with several of the people involved, said she worried that the group had become a \"death cult\" or a \"murder gang\" over their adherence to a moral code at odds with mainstream laws and behavior, including strict veganism.\n\"You're talking about being willing to kill people who they think are bad,\" said Taylor, who briefly dated a German national, Ophelia Backholt, who was killed in the Jan. 20 shootout between Youngblut and the Border Patrol.\nPoulomi Saha, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the behavior of groups that mainstream Americans would consider cults, said groups like the Zizians are hard for many to understand. She said members \"live\" online, making it hard for the public or even law enforcement to track their shift from talk to action.\n\"The internet culture and the absolute immersion that's possible there means there are forms of connection that only appear only after the fact,\" said Saha, who has been following the cases. \"We are kind of grasping for a story that makes sense of it. ... People on the outside can never fully know what's happening on the inside.\"\nAs with similar groups, Saha said, she suspects the Zizians fell under the sway of a charismatic leader who persuaded followers to do things they ordinarily wouldn't do. In participating in those extreme acts, Saha said, people fall victim to a group psychology that permits and encourages more extreme behavior.\n\"The kind of violence of the accused crimes is really quite startling,\" she said.\nYoungblut is in custody. A man she grew up with and got a license to marry, Max Snyder, 22, is jailed in California on charges he ambushed and mortally stabbed a landlord who owned the property where Lasota and others lived several years ago.\nThat landlord said he had been attacked by group members, and he shot two of them in self-defense, killing one, court records show.\nWhat's the truth?

      "text": "LSD, veganism, high-IQ suspects: Probe of six murders takes feds into strange territory\nA dead Border Patrol Agent in Vermont. An LSD-taking vegan carrying a pistol linked to two Pennsylvania homicides. An elderly California witness was ambushed and fatally stabbed. Artificial intelligence researchers living in box trucks, armed with knives and a samurai sword.\nIt sounds like something from a dystopian science fiction novel. But police, court records and witnesses are beginning to link a series of six seemingly unconnected deaths across the country.\nTwo people \u2012 who may or may not be married to each other \u2012 have been detained in connection with two deaths separated by 3,000 miles. The gun used in one of those incidents has been linked to the 2022 homicides of two people in Pennsylvania.\n\"It's a tragedy for everyone,\" said longtime Vermont prosecutor and retired legislator Vincent Illuzzi, 71. \"Folks up here are shocked at knowing that people publicly identified with these activities in Pennsylvania and California were either living here or looking for property up here.\"\nBehind bars are Seattle-area natives Teresa Youngblut, 21, detained in Vermont, and Maximilian Snyder, 22, detained in California. Records show the two got a marriage license in Washington state last year, but it's unclear whether they went through with the marriage.\nSnyder faces murder charges in California for the Jan. 17 death of an elderly landlord who was due to testify that he was attacked with a samurai sword in 2022 by squatters he was trying to kick off his San Francisco-area property, according to court records.\nYoungblut has been charged in connection with the Jan. 20 shooting death of Border Patrol agent David \"Chris\" Maland in Vermont near the Canadian border, according to court records. Youngblut has been charged with one count of using a deadly weapon while assaulting a U.S. Border Patrol agent and one count of using and discharging a firearm during that assault but has not been charged with actually killing Maland.\nA German national traveling with Youngblut, Ophelia Bauckholt, was killed in the shootout with federal agents. Bauckholt was transfeminine, and federal authorities have been using Bauckholt's male birth name in court documents. Federal officials in a court filing also acknowledged that Bauckholt used the name Ophelia.\nThe deaths of Maland and Bauckholt during the Border Patrol traffic stop shocked residents of the rural New England state where only 24 homicides happened last year. Illuzzi, who is the Essex County State's Attorney, coincidentally drove by the traffic stop as it began. Although he has no formal role in the investigation, he is a veteran prosecutor and lawmaker with deep connections to regional law enforcement in Vermont.\nAlong with the FBI, Illuzi is slowly piecing together a complicated and confusing situation. He suspects that Youngblut and Bauckholt opened fire on the Border Patrol over fears investigators had finally pieced together their connection to multiple other deaths.\nPennsylvania police last month said the gun fired during the Vermont confrontation was bought in 2024 by a \"person of interest\" in an unsolved 2022 double homicide in Delaware County.\n\"It helps to explain what happened because there just is no other explanation,\" Illuzzi said. \u201cIt appears that maybe (Youngblut and Bauckholt) panicked and were thinking that maybe police had connected the dots to what had happened in other parts of the country and thought they could shoot their way out.\u201d\nFBI agent Leah Bogdanowicz, who signed Youngblut's arrest affidavit, hinted at a broader investigation: \"Because this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause, it does not include all the facts that I have learned during the course of the investigation.\"\nThe FBI declined to discuss the substance of the cases but acknowledged potential connections.\n\u201cAs stated in open court and in court filings, Teresa Youngblut is believed to have associations with other individuals suspected of violent acts in multiple states, to include Pennsylvania and California,\" Sarah Ruane, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Albany, New York, office said in a statement. \"The FBI is coordinating information sharing on any case related details with our partners from various law enforcement agencies to effectively follow every lead and aggressively investigate these connections.\"\nWhat Trump's policies mean for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\nInexplicable escalation to violence\nAccording to court records, the Jan. 20 confrontation between Youngblut and Border Patrol agents was the violent conclusion to a weeklong surveillance effort by federal officials over reports that Youngblut and Bauckholt had been acting suspiciously as they traveled around rural northern Vermont.\nThey attracted law enforcement attention because Youngblut and Bauckholt were reported wearing tactical-style gear and openly carrying firearms, which is legal in Vermont but unusual. The two declined to speak with officers, and agents began following them, according to an affidavit. Investigators also wrongly thought Bauckholt's visa to remain in the United States had expired.\nAccording to court records and FBI affidavits, sometime in the minutes after Border Patrol agents stopped the Toyota Prius that Youngblut was driving, Youngblut opened fire with a handgun, firing at least two shots. Bauckholt, who drew a handgun, was shot before firing. Bauckholt died at the scene, and Maland, the Border Patrol agent, died at a nearby hospital. Investigators have not specified who shot who yet.\n\"An originally peaceful interaction between the United States Border Patrol and the occupants of a vehicle became confrontational based on the defendant's conduct, and she then unnecessarily and inexplicably escalated to deadly violence,\" federal prosecutors said.\nYoungblut remains in custody because a federal judge agreed with prosecutors about the potential for flight risk, in part, because of Youngblut's purported connections with other deaths, which prosecutors did not specify. Investigators said they found five cellphones, a night-vision device and laptops in the Prius. Court records note that Youngblut's diary contains several references to taking LSD.\n\"The defendant does not appear to have a reported criminal history, but her use of deadly violence without provocation suggests that the absence of prior arrests or convictions does not reflect her current disposition,\" prosecutors said of Youngblut.\nProsecutors in Vermont said Youngblut got the guns from someone who is a person of interest in a 2022 double homicide in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania State Police identified those homicide victims as Richard and Rita Zajko, 72, and 69, respectively.\nThe Times-Union newspaper reported that the Zajkos' daughter, Michelle J. Zajko is that person of interest and that Zajko is possibly driving a Subaru with Vermont license plates. Zajko is not in custody, and the Times-Union reported that Zajko owns property in Vermont near the hotel where Youngblut and Bauckholt were staying. The paper said authorities have issued a broad request for police to detain Zajko.\nCourt records obtained by USA TODAY show Pennsylvania State Police interviewed Michelle Zajko in Vermont on Jan. 5, 2023, and found Zajko in possession of a legally purchased 9mm handgun. They did not detain Zajko at the time, but later that month discovered that Zajko's parents had been shot at close range with a 9mm pistol and bullets, and forensics testing indicated the gun Zajko owned could have fired the fatal shots. Vermont police then searched Zajko's home but found only three 9mm cartridges but no gun. On Tuesday, Pennsylvania State Police declined to answer questions about why Zajko was not arrested in 2023, citing\"investigative aspects to this case that cannot be divulged at this time.\"\nIn court documents, prosecutors in the Youngblut case also referenced a separate \"person of interest\" in the Zajkos' deaths with whom Youngblut has been in frequent contact, and who is connected to a homicide in Vallejo, California, where Snyder is being held on murder charges.\nWitness in 2022 sword attack fatally stabbed in January\nVallejo police accuse Snyder of stabbing to death landlord Curtis Lind, 82, who was due to testify later this year against two people accused of assaulting him in 2022 over a rent dispute.\nAccording to police and prosecutors, a group of young people living in box trucks on Lind's property attacked him with knives and a samurai sword as he prepared to evict them in 2022. According to court and police records, Lind was seriously injured but shot two of his attackers, killing one and injuring another.\nProsecutors have not offered a motive for why they believe Snyder would have killed Lind.\nBut Jessica Taylor, 32, who casually dated Bauckholt in 2022, said Bauckholt, Snyder, Youngblut and Zajko were part of a loose-knit group bound together by their shared love of animal rights and veganism, rational thinking, and interest in artificial intelligence. Taylor, an AI security researcher, met Bauckholt while they were both living on the East Coast, but lost contact with her in 2023.\nMany of the group's members were involved, studied or worked in the fields of AI and computer science, she said. Youngblut said on an Instagram bio that they were studying computer science at the University of Washington. And Taylor said Bauckholt when they first met had been working at a Wall Street investment firm specializing in computer-assisted trading.\nTaylor said Bauckholt and her friends indicated they believed violence could sometimes be justified.\n\"I was surprised but I wasn't shocked,\" Taylor said of the Vermont incident in which Bauckholt was armed with a handgun. \"They don't assume that normal society is correct about which things are bad. (But) there's a leap from someone who is interested in ethics and thinking systematically about ethics and being kind to animals, and possibly then being involved in trying to shoot someone.\"\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported that Snyder and Youngblut are part of a group of people who call themselves \"Zizians,\" named for the group's transgender leader, Ziz. The San Francisco Chronicle said Ziz is the preferred name of a California man born as Jack LaSota, and reported that Ziz may have faked their own death in 2022.\nThe Associated Press reported that Youngblut and Bauckholt had recently lived in townhomes near Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and that they had parked box trucks out front, with indications someone was living in one of the trucks.\nCharges and cases\nVallejo police said Snyder was arrested after ambushing Lind but declined to discuss a possible motive or any connection between the two.\nThe Solano County District Attorney's office declined to discuss the case but issued a statement confirming that Snyder is being prosecuted for murder, with the death penalty possible, for killing a witness in retaliation.\nPennsylvania State Police declined to say if Michelle Zajko is a suspect in the deaths of their parents.\nSnyder is next due in court on Feb. 6. Youngblut is due in court on Feb. 7."

      "text": "Grand jury indicts accused leader of cultlike 'Zizian' group\nA federal grand jury in Maryland has indicted an Alaska person linked to a series of nationwide deaths and violence in Vermont and California via the cultlike \"Zizian\" group they are accused of inspiring.\nProsecutors say the grand jury indicted Jack Amadeus LaSota, 34, on charges they possessed a .50-caliber rifle and several handguns while being a fugitive. Court records and interviews with people who know the group say LaSota was the intellectual leader of the largely online movement interested in artificial intelligence. Some of whose members lived full time in box trucks in several states.\nLasota has also gone by the names Andrea Phelps, Ann Grimes, Anne Grimes, Canaris, Julia LaSota and \"Ziz,\" prosecutors said. LaSota was assigned male at birth but uses female pronouns; federal and state court records refer to LaSota as a man.\n\"LaSota was knowingly a fugitive from justice and therefore was not permitted by law to possess a firearm or ammunition,\" the U.S. Attorney's office in Maryland said in a statement. LaSota faces up to a 15-year prison sentence.\nAccording to court records and a USA TODAY investigation, the Zizian group is connected to at least six deaths, including the homicide of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Vermont in January. Court records also indicate LaSota may have faked their own death in 2022.\nMany of the group members are vegan, and either have degrees in computer science or have studied related fields, according to court records. Some members of the group are transgender, or have rejected binary sexuality, and are interested in the role artificial intelligence may play in creating a new society, according to interviews and court records.\nIn February, Maryland police arrested LaSota along with two other people, Michelle Zajko, 32, and Daniel Blank, 26, in a rural area after the property owner called police to report the black-clad suspects on his land.\nBlank is a suspect in the late 2022 shooting deaths of Zajko's parents in Pennsylvania, and authorities say LaSota and Zajko are being investigated in connection with other multiple deaths.\nIn January 2023, Zajko was questioned by Pennsylvania State Police about the deaths of her parents, but disappeared with LaSota, leaving behind her car and $40,000 in cash, according to court records.\nAuthorities said Zajko may have also supplied the guns used in the January shootout that ended with the death of Border Patrol agent David Maland and a German national, Ophelia Bauckholt. Arrested in that shooting was Teresa Youngblut, who is jailed and faces charges of using a deadly weapon. Zajko is also facing federal firearms charges.\nAnd a man that Youngblut last year got a license to marry, Max Snyder, is jailed in California on charges that he ambushed and fatally stabbed a landlord who had at one time allowed LaSota and other group members to park their trucks on his property. That landlord killed another member of the group in self defense after they attacked him over a planned eviction, according to court records.\n(This story has been updated to correct a misspelling/typo.)"

Here's what we know about the cult-like group.\nThe arrests of three people in Maryland has helped shed new light on a series of connected deaths across the country that experts say are tied to a group called the \"Zizians.\"\nNamed after their purported leader, Jack \"Ziz\" LaSota, 34, the group is connected to at least six deaths nationwide, according to police, interviews with people who know group members, the FBI and court records. LaSota was assigned male at birth but uses female pronouns. Federal and state court records refer to LaSota as a man.\nLaSota was one of three armed people arrested Monday after trespassing in a rural area and then asking a landowner if they could live there in two box trucks. LaSota and one of the other people arrested Monday have been on the run for months, according to police.\nThe unfolding details have drawn international attention and flashy headlines as authorities, court records and interviews have revealed a tangled web of relationships and shocking violence linked to a small group of highly educated vegan computer experts.\n\"They're not all necessarily all connected in one overarching plan. It's not necessarily like a Manson Family type of plan,\" said Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow and policy adviser at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. \"When you look at (LaSota's) writings, it's all about the mind and consciousness. (LaSota) doesn't really seem interested in left-wing political issues the way most people would understand it.\"\nUSA TODAY consulted several extremism experts, interviewed a person who knew several members of the group, and examined dozens of court filings from Vermont to Pennsylvania and California to understand the bigger picture.\nWho are the 'Zizians?'\nExperts and people who know them say the group is led by LaSota, who in online postings discussed the nature of consciousness and rational decision making. Many of the group members are vegan, and either have degrees in computer science or have studied related fields. Some members of the group are transgender, or have rejected binary sexuality.\nThe group at one time was based in the San Francisco area, living in box trucks on a landlord's property. Members also appear to have lived in North Carolina and Vermont. Citing LaSota's online postings, Pitcavage said the group has elements of a religious cult.\nBritain's Daily Mail newspaper referred to Lasota as the \"'Tech genius' leader of vegan trans cult.\" And the New York Post called the group a \"radical leftist trans militant cult.\"\nWhy were some Zizians arrested?\nGroup members are charged with violent offenses in multiple states, at both the state and federal level. Authorities have not yet indicated any cohesive motive for the offenses, and experts consulted by USA TODAY said the online nature of the connections between the Zizians may make it hard to link the crimes definitively.\nAmong those charged:\n\u220e Michelle Zajko, 32, who was arrested with a handgun alongside Lasota and another man in Maryland on Monday. Zajko faces state charges of trespassing, resisting or interfering with an arrest, obstruction and carrying a handgun. ATF agents are also pursuing federal charges against Zajko over allegations that she lied on purchasing paperwork for several guns bought in 2024 and which were later used by two other people in Vermont during a double-fatal shootout with U.S. Border Patrol agents. Zajko is also a \"person of interest\" in the Pennsylvania homicides of her parents in late 2022, according to court filings.\n\u220e Daniel Blank, 26, who faces Maryland charges of trespassing, obstruction and hindering in connection with his Monday arrest. He is also a suspect in the deaths of Zajko's parents, who were killed near where he grew up, Maryland court records show. Blank was reported missing in 2022, according to Pennsylvania State Police.\n\u220e LaSota faces Maryland charges of trespassing, obstruction and possession of a handgun in a vehicle. Court records in Vermont have also referred to LaSota as a \"person of interest\" in the deaths of Zajko's parents. LaSota may have faked her own death in April 2022, according to an obituary in her hometown Alaska newspaper.\n\u220e Teresa Youngblut, 21, accused by federal prosecutors of shooting at U.S. Border Patrol agent David Maland on Jan. 20 near the Canadian border in northern Vermont. Maland was killed in the exchange, as was a German national Youngblut was traveling with, Ophelia Bauckholt. Federal court filings indicate Zajko bought the guns Youngblut and Bauckholt were carrying. Youngblut is in federal custody.\n\u220e Max Snyder, 22, who late last year got a marriage license to wed Youngblut in Seattle, Washington, where they grew up. Snyder is accused by Solano County, Calif. prosecutors of ambushing and fatally stabbing a landlord who in December 2022 tried to evict Lasota and other group members from his Vallejo, Calif., property. The landlord shot two of the group members, killing one, in an incident ruled self defense by prosecutors.\nWhat motivates the Zizian group? Is it a cult?\nMany of the group members come from middle-class families and have studied computer science or related fields, according to Jessica Taylor, a California-based AI safety researcher who knew group members socially. Taylor briefly dated Bauckholt, the German national, who she said had worked for a Wall Street trading firm around 2022, specializing in using AI to enhance trading strategies.\nPitcavage, the extremism expert, said online postings attributed to Lasota indicate an obsession with the mind, rational thinking and consciousness. Lasota and several other group members were arrested in 2019 while protesting a rationalist group meeting. Rationalists believe in using logic to make decisions and create rules, as opposed to historical precedent or emotion.\n\"There's significant evidence that Jack LaSota is the person who is the idea engine for these people,\" said Pitcavage.\nThe Maryland state public defender's office, which is representing LaSota, Blank and Zajko in the Maryland arrests, declined to comment Thursday, other than to clarify LaSota's pronouns.\nTaylor said she worried that the group had become a \"death cult\" or a \"murder gang\" over their adherence to a moral code at odds with mainstream laws and behavior, including strict veganism and the belief that landlords are inherently corrupt.\n\"You're talking about being willing to kill people who they think are bad,\" said Taylor, adding that she lost touch with Bauckholt in 2023.\nPoulomi Saha, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the behavior of groups that mainstream Americans would consider cults, said groups like the Zizians are hard for many to understand. She said members \"live\" online, making it hard for the public or even law enforcement to track their shift from talk to action.\nShe said it's not clear the Zizians are a cult, but acknowledged many people might consider them one.\n\"The internet culture and the absolute immersion that's possible there means there are forms of connection that only appear only after the fact,\" said Saha, who has been following the cases. \"We are kind of grasping for a story that makes sense of it \u2026 People on the outside can never fully know what's happening on the inside.\"\nAs with similar groups, Saha said, she suspects the Zizians fell under the sway of a charismatic leader who persuaded followers to do things they ordinarily wouldn't do. In participating in those extreme acts, Saha said, people fall victim to a group psychology that both permits and encourages more extreme behavior.\n\"The kind of violence of the accused crimes is really quite startling,\" she said.\nIs there an overall federal case against the Zizians?\nAlthough court records are replete with references to an ongoing FBI investigation, the FBI has so far declined to comment substantively on the Zizian group.\nExperts consulted by USA TODAY say this is the kind of case the FBI specializes in, because the incidents cross state lines, involve potentially illegally purchased firearms and included the death of a federal law enforcement officer.\n(This story has been updated with additional information and to correct the pronouns used by LaSota.)"

      "text": "Arrests shed new light on 'Zizian' group tied to multiple homicides nationally\nA homicide suspect and two other people sought in connection with multiple deaths were caught after parking at the end of a remote dirt road in Maryland and asked the property owner if they could live there, court records show.\nMaryland police on Monday afternoon arrested Jack \"Ziz\" Lasota, 34, Michelle Zajko, 32, and Daniel Blank, 26, in a rural area after the property owner called police to report the black-clad suspects on his land. They were collectively armed with a rifle and two handguns, including a loaded pistol tucked into Zajko's waistband, police said.\n\"All of the subjects involved are to be questioned regarding other crimes that have occurred across the country,\" Master Trooper Brandon Jeffries wrote in an arrest affidavit for the three.\nCourt records and interviews indicate Lasota is the ideological leader of a small group of highly educated computer experts and vegans who called themselves \"Zizians,\" lived in box trucks in California and North Carolina, and are connected to at least six deaths nationally. Some of the group members are transgender.\nThe FBI is investigating but has declined to reveal details, and one expert said the group has some hallmarks of a religious cult, with Lasota as a charismatic leader who has inspired seemingly disconnected actions.\n\"They're not all necessarily all connected in one overarching plan. It's not necessarily like a Manson Family-type of plan,\" said Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow and policy adviser at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. \"When you look at his writings, it's all about the mind and consciousness. He doesn't really seem interested in left-wing political issues the way most people would understand it.\"\nBlank is a suspect in the late 2022 shooting deaths of Zajko's parents in Pennsylvania, and authorities say Lasota and Zajko are being investigating in connection with other multiple deaths nationally, including the Jan. 20 shooting death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Vermont.\nAuthorities said Zajko may have supplied the guns used in the shootout that ended with the death of Border Patrol agent David Maland and a German national, Ophelia Bauckholt. Arrested in that shooting was Teresa Youngblut, who is jailed and faces charges of using a deadly weapon.\nAnd a man that Youngblut last year got a license to marry, Max Snyder, is jailed in California on charges that he ambushed and fatally stabbed a landlord who had at one time allowed Lasota and other group members to park their trucks on his property. That landlord killed another member of the group in self defense after they attacked him over a planned eviction, according to court records.\n\"These people are educated, good at math. They had this very moral lifestyle, believed reasonable things, and then to just to go off and join a murder gang is just so weird,\" said Jessica Taylor, 32, a California-based AI safety researcher who briefly dated Bauckholt and knew several other members of the group.\nCourt records obtained by USA TODAY show Pennsylvania State Police interviewed Zajko in Vermont in early 2023 after the deaths of her parents, and found her in possession of a legally purchased 9 mm handgun. They did not detain Zajko at that time, but later that month discovered that Zajko's parents had been shot at close range with a 9 mm pistol and bullets, and that forensics testing indicated the gun Zajko owned could have fired the fatal shots.\nVermont police then returned to search Zajko's home but found only three 9 mm cartridges but no gun.\nIn January 2023, Zajko was questioned by Pennsylvania State Police about the deaths of her parents, but disappeared before being arrested, leaving behind her car and $40,000 in cash, according to court records. The ATF is now seeking federal firearms charges against her.\nIn the Monday arrest affidavit, Maryland State Police said they found Zajko, Lasota and Blank parked down a dirt road in two trucks with temporary registration plates. Ordered to come out, Blank surrendered quickly, but after \"crying, saying not to kill her,\" Zajko refused to be handcuffed until officers dropped her to the ground, where they discovered a loaded handgun in her waistband.\nAll three refused to provide identification or sign arrest paperwork, and were identified only after their pictures were shown to an FBI agent, police said."

      "text": "Related Content\nPress Release\nPress Release\nA federal grand jury in the District of Vermont returned a four-count superseding indictment today charging Teresa Youngblut, 21, of Seattle, with the murder of a Border Patrol agent, the assault of two additional agents with a deadly weapon, and related firearms offenses.\n\u201cAs alleged, this defendant shot and killed a United States Border Patrol Agent while he was performing his duties,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division. \u201cWe will not stand for such attacks on the men and women who protect our communities and our borders.\u201d\n\u201cThe United States Attorney\u2019s Office intends to continue to honor the men and women of law enforcement, and the memory of Border Patrol Agent Maland, by performing its prosecutorial duties so that justice may be done,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael P. Drescher for the District of Vermont.\n\u201cThe murder of a federal agent is more than a tragic loss,\u201d said Assistant Director Jose A. Perez of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on the security of our nation and the safety of our communities. The FBI and our law enforcement partners will not rest until those responsible are held accountable. We are all steadfast in our mission to curb violence that endangers both public servants and the citizens we are sworn to protect.\"\nAccording to court documents, on the afternoon of Jan. 20. a U.S. Border Patrol agent conducted a traffic stop of a Toyota Prius on Interstate 91 in Coventry, Vermont. Youngblut and a male German citizen \u2013 whose immigration status was in question \u2013 were in the car.\nDays earlier, law enforcement had taken note of Youngblut and her companion when a hotel employee reported that they were wearing tactical gear and appeared to be armed. The same day of the shooting, officers had observed the pair at a parking lot in Newport, Vermont, where the German citizen was seen wrapping unknown objects in aluminum foil.\nCourt documents allege that during the Jan. 20 vehicle stop, both Youngblut and her companion were armed. Youngblut exited the vehicle and, without warning, opened fire, resulting in the death of one of the agents.\nFor the current charges, the maximum penalty is death, and Attorney General Pamela Bondi has authorized and directed the Acting United States Attorney for the District of Vermont to pursue capital punishment in this case. Consistent with that authorization and direction, the Acting U.S. Attorney has filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty against Youngblut.\nThe FBI Albany Field Office investigated the case, with substantial assistance from the Vermont State Police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in coordination with Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Border Patrol, the Newport Police Department, and the Orleans County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nTrial Attorneys Lisa M. Thelwell and Dennis Robinson of the Criminal Division\u2019s Violent Crime and Racketeering Section (VCRS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Lasher for the District of Vermont are prosecuting the case.\nAn indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."

      "text": "Feds pursuing death penalty in fatal Vermont Border Patrol shooting, attorneys claim\nFederal prosecutors appear to be preparing to seek the death penalty against a woman accused in the January shooting of a U.S. Border Patrol agent near the Canadian border, and her attorneys are asking a judge to slow down the process.\nAttorneys for Teresa Youngblut complained in a June 30 court filing in Vermont that prosecutors are pushing an unusually aggressive timeline for bringing a death penalty case. They say the rush to judgment violates her right to investigate mitigating circumstances.\n\"This court should step in to ensure Miss Youngblut receives a meaningful opportunity to persuade the government not to pursue the death penalty,\" her attorneys said in a court filing.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi in February singled out Youngblut's case as a prime example of how the Trump administration will aggressively seek capital punishment. Bondi said the Trump administration is committed to seeking swift justice when it comes to capital murder cases, and ordered her staff to reconsider past \"no seek\" decisions where federal prosecutors could have sought the death penalty but didn't.\n\"Going forward, the Department of Justice will once again act as the law demands, including by seeking death sentences in appropriate cases and swiftly implementing those sentences in accordance with the law,\" Bondi said.\nWhat happened on Jan. 20?\nAuthorities say Youngblut and a companion pulled guns on Border Patrol agents during a Jan. 20 traffic stop in which agent David Maland was shot and killed. Youngblut has not yet been specifically charged with firing the fatal shot, nor been formally notified that she faces the death penalty.\nThe confrontation between Youngblut and Maland appears connected to a series of deaths nationwide related to the cultlike \"Zizan\" group, which is also being investigated in California, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The internal Justice Department process to decide whether to seek the death penalty typically takes more than a year, Youngblut's attorneys said, with even more time needed to hold the actual trial.\nYoungblut's attorneys also argue that with her life on the line, she is legally entitled to more time to investigate any mitigating circumstances. Court records note that Youngblut's diary contains several references to taking LSD.\nA German national traveling with Youngblut, Ophelia Bauckholt, was also killed in the shootout with federal agents.\nThe two initially attracted law enforcement attention because Youngblut and Bauckholt were reported wearing tactical-style gear and openly carrying firearms, which is legal in Vermont but unusual. The two declined to speak with officers, and agents began following them, according to an affidavit.\nInvestigators also wrongly thought Bauckholt's visa to remain in the United States had expired.\nAccording to court records and FBI affidavits, sometime in the minutes after Border Patrol agents stopped the Toyota Prius that Youngblut was driving, Youngblut opened fire with a handgun, firing at least two shots. Bauckholt, who also drew a handgun, was shot before firing. Bauckholt died at the scene, and Maland, the Border Patrol agent, died at a nearby hospital.\nInvestigators said they found five cellphones, a night-vision device, and laptops in the Prius.\nEarlier this month, a grand jury indicted the Zizian group's namesake, Jack \"Ziz\" LaSota, on weapons charges. And a man that Youngblut was planning to marry was arrested Jan. 24 in connection with the Jan. 17 slaying of a California landlord, according to court records.\nA longtime Vermont defense attorney familiar with the case previously told USA TODAY he believes Youngblut opened fire on the Border Patrol agents because she thought they knew about the California murder that happened three days earlier."
