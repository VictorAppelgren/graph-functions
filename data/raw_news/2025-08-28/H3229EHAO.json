  "description": "First lady Melania Trump issued a rare statement Wednesday calling for \u201cpre-emptive\u201d intervention\u201d to identify future school shooters after the Minneapolis shooting left two children dead and 17 ot\u2026",
  "content": "First lady Melania Trump said she was \u201cshattered\u201d by the \u201csenseless and depraved\u201d deadly shooting at a Minneapolis school\u2019s morning Mass \u2014 as she also called for improved screening to spot those signaling plans to carry out such carnage.\n\n\u201cThe tragic mass killing in Minnesota illuminates the need for pre-emptive intervention in identifying potential school shooters,\u201d the first lady posted on X late Wednesday, hours after two kids were killed and 17 others injured.\n\n\u201cEarly warning signs are often evident, with many individuals exhibiting concerning behaviors and making violent threats online prior to their actions,\u201d she added.\n\nHer statement came hours after deranged gunman Robin Westman, 23, opened fire on the Annunciation Catholic Church and School Wednesday morning while students were praying at mass.\n\nThe transgender shooter had posted disturbing videos online that included showing pages of a chilling handwritten manifesto glorifying violence on a since-deleted YouTube page.\n\nThe video showed the phrases \u201ckill Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cfor the children\u201d scrawled on gun magazines.\n\nWestman, who legally changed his name from Robert to Robin in 2020, also went into alarming detail about his decision to target the school, where he graduated from grade school in 2017.\n\nMelania Trump said that preventing mass shootings like Wednesday\u2019s has to start with identifying warning signs of potential violence in individuals at home.\n\n\u201cTo prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioral threat assessments across all levels of society \u2014 beginning in our homes, extending through school districts and of course, social media platforms. Being aware of these warning signs and acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer.\u201d\n\nThe first lady added that her heart was \u201cshattered\u201d for the victims\u2019 and families\u2019 affected by a \u201csenseless and depraved violent act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that anyone can say to make your grief go away, but please know that you are not alone,\u201d she added.",

      "text": "Emmanuel Haro\u2019s father admitted to killing missing baby and dumping him in trash can: report\nEmmanuel Haro\u2019s father was tricked into admitting that he killed the 7-month-old and dumped his body in a trash can, according to a new report \u2014 as authorities say the baby died after enduring lengthy abuse by his parents.\nInvestigators used an undercover inmate to goad Jake Haro into admitting to the grisly crime, NewsNation\u2019s Brian Entin reported, citing sources.\nMeanwhile, authorities said they can prove Emmanuel died after a long period of physical abuse at the hands of Haro and his wife Rebecca at their home Riverside County, California.\n\u201cWe believe baby Emmanuel was subject to abuse over time, and because of that abuse, he succumbed to his injuries,\u201d Riverside County District Attorney Michael Hestrin told reporters Wednesday.\n\u201cWe have a pretty strong indication of where the remains of baby Emmanuel are,\u201d he added.\nJake Haro\u2019s wife Rebecca initially told cops a strange man had hit her on the head and snatched the kid while she was changing his diaper outside a sporting goods store in San Bernardino on August 14.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies arrested the Haros several days later and charged them with murder, citing \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in their stories.\nJake Haro changed the story from jail, telling cops he rolled over on Emmanuel while he slept and suffocated him, burying his body near a freeway, according to Brian Entin\u2019s source.\nThe freeway story may explain why Jake Haro was seen with investigators in a remote field in Moreno Valley.\n\u201cWe have some ideas in terms of where we\u2019re going to look and where we\u2019re going to continue to investigate,\u201d Hestrin said.\nHestrin pointed to a 2023 child abuse conviction against Haro, 32, who severely beat his young daughter from a previous marriage, leaving the girl bedridden with permanent injuries.\nWhat you need to know about the disappearance of Emmanuel Haro:\n- Parents Jake and Rebecca Haro were arrested on Aug. 22 on murder charges a week after their 7-month-old son Emmanuel went missing in Cabazon, Calif.\n- The mother previously claimed their baby boy was abducted after a man attacked her outside of a sporting goods store in Yucaipa on Aug. 14 \u2014 but police said there were inconsistencies with her story.\n- Jake Haro\u2019s car was seized by police days later for evidence as the search continued for Emmanuel. The father previously served a prison sentence for child cruelty stemming from an incident in 2018 and is currently on probation.\n- Police officers stormed into the Haros\u2019 house and arrested them after determining there was no abduction. \u201cIt is believed Emmanuel is deceased, and the search to recover his remains is ongoing,\u201d the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department said in a statement.\n- Jake Haro was seen in an orange prison jumpsuit assisting police officers in the search for Emmanuel\u2019s remains off of a highway in Moreno Valley, Calif. on Aug. 24.\nHestrin said Haro should have been in prison after that incident, which left his child with fractured ribs, fractured skull, a brain hemorrhage, and other injuries.\nYet Haro received no jail time.\n\u201cThat decision was absolutely outrageous. Mr. Haro should have been in prison,\u201d Hestrin said.\nAuthorities confirmed that both Jake and Rebecca Haro will be charged with murder, but they emphasized that they do not have a precise location for Emmanuel\u2019s body.\nPolice also tried to dupe Rebecca Haro with a similar undercover inmate operation, also known as a \u201csnitch jacket,\u201d but she stuck by her story, NewsNation reported.\nEmmanuel may have been dead weeks before the couple reported the kidnapping, Entin added.\nThe couple have two other children: A 2-year-old daughter and a 16-year-old, who Jake\u2019s stepchild. The daughter has been taken into the care of Riverside Child Protective Services.\nThe parents were set to be arraigned on Tuesday but the appearance was postponed until next week.\nThe Riverside County Sheriff \u2014 which is conducting a joint investigation with cops in San Bernadino \u2014 revealed that they responded to a report of suspected child abuse near the sporting-goods store on the same day Emmanuel vanished \u2014 and that the Haros are linked to that probe.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies said the report involved a home on Cottonwood Avenue in Moreno Valley, just down the road from the Big 5 Sporting Goods, where Rebecca claimed to have been attacked.\n\u201cThe investigation is related to the Haros and no further details are available,\u2019\u2019 authorities said in a statement, referring to the child-abuse report.\nLittle Emmanuel\u2019s body still has not been found."

      "text": "Minneapolis school shooter ID\u2019d as trans woman Robin Westman \u2014 as apparent manifesto included \u2018kill Trump\u2019\nThe deranged gunman who slaughtered two children and injured at least 17 others at a Catholic school in Minneapolis has been identified as a transgender woman \u2014 as disturbing videos posted by the shooter show a handwritten manifesto and \u201ckill Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cfor the children\u201d scrawled on gun magazines.\nRobin Westman, formerly Robert Westman, opened fire through the stained glass windows of a church at the Annunciation Catholic School \u2014 where he attended \u2014 during a celebratory back-to-school Mass filled with children around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday.\nJust hours before the cowardly massacre, Westman, 23, posted a series of twisted videos on YouTube, which included a manifesto, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara confirmed at a press conference.\nIn one 20-minute video, Westman flips through the disturbing handwritten manifesto. Much of it is written in a homespun code that uses Cyrillic characters and English phonetic words.\nIn the deranged writings, he gleefully fantasizes about \u201cbeing that scary horrible monster standing over those powerless kids\u201d and reverently confesses admiration for the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.\nWestman applied to change his birth name from Robert to Robin in Dakota County, Minn., when he was 17 years old, according to court documents. That name change was granted in January 2020.\nThe petition added that Westman \u201cidentifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.\u201d\nBut, five years later, he seemed to have backed away from that identity.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to dress girly all the time but I guess sometimes I really like it. I know I am not a woman but I definitely don\u2019t feel like a man,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cI really like my outfit. I look pretty, smart and modest. I think I want to wear something like this for my shooting.\u201d\nHe also goes into great detail about his decision to target Annunciation, where he graduated from grade school in 2017, according to a yearbook obtained by CNN.\nHis mother, Mary Grace Westman, also worked as a secretary at the school until retiring in 2021, according to a Facebook post by the church.\n\u201cI am feeling good about Annunciation. It seems like a good combo of easy attack form and devastating tragedy and I want to do more research. I have concerns about finding a large enough group. I want to avoid any parents, but pre and post school drop off,\u201d another page reads.\n\u201cMaybe I could attack an event at the on-site church,\u201d he ominously scribbled. \u201cI think attacking a large group of kids coming in from recess is my best plan \u2026 Then from there I can go inside and kill, going for as long as I can.\u201d\nNear the end of the video, Westman flicks through a number of blank pages before reaching what appears to be a drawing showing the inside of a church, saying \u201cHaha, nice\u201d as he stops turning pages.\nHe then takes out a knife and stabs into the center of the sketch, his hand momentarily quivering before he withdraws the blade, and quietly mumbles, \u201ckill myself.\u201d\nIn a video, titled \u201cSo long and thanks for all the fish,\u201d Westman slowly turns the pages of the red notebook, which is laid out on top of what appears to be schematic gun diagrams, one of them reading Ruger Mark IV \u2014 a type of small-caliber pistol.\nAs he flips the pages, an occasional plume of smoke is seen from the bottom of the screen, punctuated by coughs, disjointed cursing and maniacal giggles.\nEach page is filled with inscrutable handwritten doggerel, which includes violent ramblings such as \u201cI have had thoughts about mass murder for a long time. I am very conflicted with writing this journal,\u201d the text, translated by The Post, reads in part.\n\u201cI need to get my thoughts out without getting on a watchlist haha!\u201d\nHere is the latest on the mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school:\n- First surviving victim in Minneapolis school shooting ID\u2019d, now out of surgery\n- Minneapolis mayor uses Catholic school shooting presser to speak out about transgender rights \u2014 as gunman ID\u2019d as trans\n- Melania Trump \u2018shattered\u2019 to \u2018senseless and depraved\u2019 Minnesota school shooting, calls for \u2018pre-emptive intervention\u2019\nThe journal contains a number of other subtle clues about Weston\u2019s identity \u2014 hinting at an angry melange of far-left politics and antisemitism.\nOne page includes a trans pride flag sticker with \u201cDefend equality\u201d printed across the bottom, with a black AK-47 sticker laid on top.\nIn another entry, he writes, \u201cIf I carry out a racially motivated attack, it would be most likely against filthy Zionist jews,\u201d before calling Jewish people \u201centitled\u201d and \u201cpenny-sniffing\u201d before adding \u201cFREE PALESTINE!\u201d\n\u201cI hate fascism,\u201d read yet another page, following it up shortly after with \u201cI also love when kids get shot, I love to see kids get torn apart.\u201d\nHe later bemoaned the media, saying he is \u201ctired of the news headlines.\u201d\n\u201cThey only talk about brown people dying and I don\u2019t care about them. I like to hear when Israelis get killed, but they don\u2019t like to report on that stuff,\u201d he wrote.\nThe demented manifesto sheds light on what appears to be a truly disturbed mind, with Weston musing about a grand \u201cfinal act\u201d \u2014 stating a desire to take out \u201ca target of political or societal significance\u201d before he died.\n\u201cTargets like [Elon] Musk, Trump or some significant exec.\u201d\nBut, he also claimed he had no political motive.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to [do] it to spread a message. I do it to please myself. I do it because I am sick,\u201d he wrote.\nHe also indicated that he knew the Annunciation shooting would culminate in his death and complained about apparent health issues.\n\u201cI think I might have some prostate problems. I have to piss so frequently and I\u2019m sick of it. Even if I can heal, I still just want to die and kill many people,\u201d the journal read.\nThe unhinged shooter went on to express sincere admiration for mass shooters \u2014 including Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza.\n\u201cI have a deep fascination with one man in particular: Adam Lanza,\u201d he wrote in the journal on May 23 in reference to the 20-year-old perpetrator of the worst elementary school shooting in US history, which left 20 first-grade students and six adults dead.\n\u201cSandy Hook was my favorite, I think, exposure of school shootings.\u201d\nAnother video posted to YouTube in the hours before the sickening slaughter showed off a cache of weapons \u2014 including a semi-automatic rifle and a shotgun.\nGun magazines were scrawled with \u201cfor the children\u201d and \u201ckill Donald Trump.\u201d\nWestman, who died at the scene of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was armed with a rifle, a shotgun and a handgun \u2014 all of which he bought legally, cops said.\nThe shooter was not previously known to law enforcement, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara told reporters at a press conference."
