      "feedback": "The current write-up is informative but underdelivers on a world‑class, 3–6 month horizon: it leans on a single promo example (Bose QC deal at $209 via ABHP86) without a disciplined scenario map, explicit probability weights, or clearly defined catalysts and invalidations; it also lacks explicit numbers beyond the promo and battery claim, and it does not quantify price/volume trajectories or incorporate wider macro demand signals (which the SECTION FOCUS calls for). Edit it into a compact, testable scenario framework anchored to CX6HKQ3LY: Base case (most likely, e.g., promo cadence continues into holiday season with Bose QC at roughly $200–$230 black variant, 24h battery and 15‑min fast‑charge yielding ~2.5h; XM6 around $400–$450 list with ongoing cross‑brand comparison); Alternative 1 (bullish promos compress Bose/Sony/Apple pricing further, Bose QC at ~$180–$200, potential bundling with ecosystems, sustains volume but compresses margins); Alternative 2 (bearish promo slowdown or macro pullback, promos retreat to ~$230–$260 for QC and renewals delayed); map each scenario to triggers (holiday campaigns, new model launches like XM6 or QC Ultra Headphones, updated LDAC/USB‑C feature uptake, cross‑brand promo calendars) and invalidations (e.g., a faster‑than‑expected price normalization or a disruptive new flagship that redraws the ladder); quantify the path‑to‑value: price paths, unit velocity, gross margin implications, and how LDAC/USB‑C feature uptake affects demand; define 1–2 watch‑list signals (promo depth around $200–$250 for Bose, cadence of “Best headphones of 2025” updates and new model introductions; track XM6 pricing and promo windows); and end with a base case plus 1–2 explicit alts, plus risks and a concise confidence rubric (e.g., base 60%, altA 25%, altB 15%). Ensure every factual claim ties to CX6HKQ3LY with (CX6HKQ3LY), explicitly noting black‑version promo limits and cross‑brand references (XM6, AirPods Max) to reconcile competing signals; explicitly state macro data gaps and plan to plug in consumer‑demand indicators if allowed. This will produce a tighter, testable, decision‑oriented analysis rather than a narrative summary.",
