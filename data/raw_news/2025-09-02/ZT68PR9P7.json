  "content": "The reviews are in for Arch Manning\u2019s season debut as the Texas starting quarterback, and things were decidedly mixed.\n\nOne scout told Fox Sports that the 14-7 loss to Ohio State was \u201ca little hard to watch,\u201d while some preached patience for the youngster.\n\nDuring Manning\u2019s highly anticipated start on Saturday afternoon in Columbus, representatives from 22 NFL teams were on hand, with 33 scouts taking in the action.\n\nManning completed 17 of 30 pass attempts against the Buckeyes for 170 yards with a touchdown and one interception. He also rushed 10 times for 39 yards.\n\nOne NFC scout told Fox Sports that Manning was in a lose-lose situation with all the hype around him entering the game, but thought he would have played better.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it was a little hard to watch,\u201d the scout said. \u201cHe\u2019s just been hyped up so much. Almost no matter what he did, he couldn\u2019t have met those expectations. But I will admit that I thought he\u2019d be better than he was.\u201d\n\nAnother scout noted that the secondary for Ohio State was \u201cvery good\u201d and there were a number of players on it that will be playing \u201cin the league\u201d in the future.\n\nWhile the pendulum of public opinion on Manning has swung the other way, two scouts warned observers that it is \u201ctoo early in the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d an AFC scout said. \u201c[Texas coach Steve Sarkisian] will coach him up. You guys [media] made the mistake of overhyping him based on two games last year. Don\u2019t make the same mistake of doubting him now based on one bad game to start this year.\u201d\n\nDaniel Kelly, a former scout for the Jets, wrote on X that he liked a lot of what he saw from Manning after a \u201crobotic\u201d first quarter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually encouraged by what Manning put on tape against Ohio State,\u201d Kelly wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s showed improvement in several key areas. He\u2019s gotten better at seeing the whole field. He\u2019s better at going through his progressions and delivering more accurately on his 2nd and 3rd reads. And he\u2019s A LOT better at feeling pressure. I noticed several plays against Ohio State he was able to get out of danger and either pick up yardage with his legs or he was able to sidestep pressure while keeping his eyes downfield.\u201d\n\nManning told reporters Monday that \u201cI\u2019ve got to play better,\u201d and Sarkisian noted that some of the issues with Manning\u2019s throwing game were \u201cdefinitely [lessons] learned on that stuff.\u201d",

      "text": "Giants reward Jaxson Dart for sensational training camp as depth chart revealed\nThe confidence is real.\nThe spring and summer meant something.\nThe preseason games were telling.\nAfter passing every test \u2014 acing them, really \u2014 Jaxson Dart emerged as the backup quarterback for the Giants.\nTheir first unofficial depth chart of the regular season was revealed Tuesday and the quarterback pecking order reads like this:\nRussell Wilson, Jaxson Dart, Jameis Winston.\nThis is not merely names on a printout because the NFL requires teams to assemble a depth chart each week.\nDart, the 22-year old rookie, beat out Winston, entering his ninth NFL season, for the No. 2 spot.\nThat means coach Brian Daboll at this point in Dart\u2019s early development has more confidence that Dart can get the job done than Winston, should anything happen to Wilson in Sunday\u2019s season opener against the Commanders at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Md.\nThe Giants traded back up into the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft to get Dart with the No. 25 overall pick.\nAt the time, the front office and coaching staff was in lockstep that there was no need or desire to rush him onto the field.\nDart was mostly given second-team reps throughout training camp \u2014 Wilson worked with the starters and Winston worked with the third-team offense \u2014 and Dart got in the preseason games ahead of Winston.\nStill, the regular season is a different deal and often, a determination is made that the veteran gets the backup job and the rookie is the emergency No. 3 quarterback on game days.\nThat will not be the case this weekend for the Giants.\nDaboll revealed nothing Monday when asked who his No. 2 quarterback will be.\n\u201cYeah, any roster decisions based on who\u2019s going to be in the backup or who this player is going to be, we\u2019ll have that out there on Sunday,\u2019\u2019 Daboll said.\nHeading into the summer, the Giants were of the mindset that Dart will sit and wait his turn behind Wilson and, presumably, Winston.\nThat mindset changed as Dart opened eyes throughout the building.\nDaboll almost on a daily basis tested the 22-year old Dart, forcing him into unexpected or uncomfortable situations.\nDart, who certainly received work with the starters on offense, never backed down and usually found the correct answers to the questions and got the job done on the field.\nThere were no real surprises with the first depth chart.\nGreg Van Roten is listed as the starting right guard, having fended off a mild challenge from Evan Neal, who moved to a new position after failing at right tackle.\nThe starting cornerback spot opposite newcomer Paulson Adebo is listed as Cor\u2019Dale Flott or Deonte Banks, so that will be a game-day revelation.\nOn the defensive line, Rakeem Nunez-Roches is the starting defensive tackle, with Roy Robertson-Harris the backup.\nRookie sensation Abdul Carter is listed as the backup to starter Brian Burns at outside linebacker.\nDaniel Bellinger is listed as the No. 2 tight end, behind Theo Johnson."

      "text": "Czech tennis ace Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1 broke down in tears at the US Open last week when she spotted an ex-boyfriend she said \u201cshows up at places where he shouldn\u2019t be\u201d in the stands during her match.\nThe world\u2019s No. 13 player was serving down 1-4 against Sorana C\u00eerstea on Thursday when she suddenly froze, gestured toward the crowd and grabbed a towel to wipe her face. She apologized to the chair umpire for the delay before resuming play through tears.\n\u201cWell \u2026 it wasn\u2019t tennis-related,\u201d Muchov\u00e1 later explained in Czech at her post-match press conference.\n\u201cOpposite my bench, my ex-boyfriend sat down. He sometimes shows up at places where he shouldn\u2019t be. That startled me a bit. I told him to leave, he didn\u2019t, but later he did go. It was hard to focus in that moment,\u201d she said, according to a translation first published by The Athletic.\nDespite the disruption and being visibly shaken, the 28-year-old semifinalist regrouped to win the match.\nTournament rules allow players to block certain individuals from obtaining tickets or credentials, but Muchov\u00e1 has not made such a request.\nTwo days later, after beating fellow Czech Linda Noskov\u00e1, she tried to move on.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m alright. I didn\u2019t make any report, and everything is good,\u201d she told reporters Saturday.\nAsked if she is confident such incidents won\u2019t happen again, Muchov\u00e1 replied, \u201cI mean, who knows, right? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe unsettling scene is the latest in a pattern of women\u2019s tennis players being disrupted by unwanted faces in the crowd.\nAt Wimbledon in July, Britain\u2019s Emma Raducanu burst into tears when she recognized a man who harassed her earlier in Dubai and been issued a restraining order to stay away from her.\nHe was later banned from the All England Club\u2019s ticket ballot. In that match, Raducanu was playing Muchov\u00e1.\nRaducanu later admitted she \u201ccouldn\u2019t see the ball through tears\u201d and \u201ccould barely breathe\u201d after spotting the man mid-match.\nThe USTA said it takes these situations seriously.\n\u201cPlayer safety is a critical element of our planning and execution for the US Open,\u201d a rep said, noting that security teams work with federal and local law enforcement to ensure a safe environment and monitor both in-person and online threats.\nStill, experts say the sport is especially vulnerable.\n\u201cYou put individuality, precociousness, attractiveness and visibility together, and women\u2019s tennis is a perfect storm for fixated individuals,\u201d a former WTA executive told The Athletic.\nThe most infamous troubling moment on the court occurred in 1993, when 19-year-old Monica Seles was stabbed in the back by a deranged fan during a match in Hamburg. Afterward, she never fully returned to the dominance she once had.\nOther stars have faced persistent harassment.\nMartina Hingis, a teenage prodigy, has spoken out about men who followed her from hotel to hotel during the height of her career.\nIn 2011, a man who called himself Serena Williams\u2019 \u201chusband\u201d also was arrested after attempting to gain access to her Florida home, sparking tighter personal security measures for the 23-time Grand Slam champion.\nMuchov\u00e1, a two-time US Open semifinalist, is trying to put her own unsettling episode behind her as she heads into a fourth-round clash with No. 27 seed Marta Kostyuk on Monday."

      "text": "'Hard to Watch': The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of Arch Manning's 2025 Debut\nThere is no point in sugarcoating things. After an offseason full of Heisman and NFL Draft hype, Texas quarterback Arch Manning stumbled in his 2025 debut, a 14-7 road loss Saturday to Ohio State.\nRepresentatives from 22 NFL teams attended the season-opening showdown between top-ranked Texas and No. 3 Ohio State, and a few of the 33 scouts there agreed to share their unfiltered thoughts with FOX Sports following the game.\nOne need not be a pro scout to tell you that Manning\u2019s final stat line looks better on paper than it did during the game itself. Officially, he completed 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards with one touchdown and one interception. He also ran 10 times for 39 yards. The interception was a deep throw to the sideline that he stared down, allowing the defender plenty of time to undercut the route.\nFrankly, Manning was even less accurate than these pedestrian numbers suggest, skipping passes at the feet of would-be receivers on multiple occasions \u2014 including on his first attempt of the game.\nHowever, even as early-game jitters subsided, Manning made relatively simple tosses look difficult, failing to step into his throws and instead whipping sidearm fastballs that made corralling them unnecessarily tough on his receivers.\nArch Manning had an inauspicious season debut in the Texas Longhorns' loss to the Ohio State Buckeyes. (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)\nManning was officially intercepted once but had a second pick overturned on replay. His lone touchdown pass and 134 of his 170 total passing yards came in the fourth quarter, after the defending champion Buckeyes had staked a 14-0 lead.\nIt was a far cry from the 67.8% completion rate and a 9:2 TD-INT ratio Manning enjoyed a year ago, when he guided the Longhorns to 51-3 and 35-13 home victories against Louisiana-Monroe and Mississippi State, respectively, while then-starter Quinn Ewers was injured. Or from the consensus opinion that he's the best QB prospect in college football and the player most likely to be selected No. 1 in the 2026 draft.\n\"Honestly, it was a little hard to watch,\" one longtime NFC scout told me. \"He\u2019s just been hyped up so much. Almost no matter what he did, he couldn\u2019t have met those expectations. But I will admit that I thought he\u2019d be better than he was.\"\nClearly, much of his (and our own expectations) for Manning stem from his record-setting uncles and grandfather. The scout cautioned that sometimes too much emphasis is placed on bloodlines, especially by media.\n\"If Shedeur [Sanders] last year didn\u2019t prove it to y\u2019all that the league cares more about the tape than the pedigree, I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\"\nShedeur Sanders fell to the fifth round of the 2025 draft, despite being universally projected to go in the first round. (Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images)\nAnother scout \u2014 this one for an AFC club potentially in search of a QB in the 2026 draft \u2014 was quick to acknowledge the hostile environment Saturday and Ohio State\u2019s talent on the field, as well as the sideline.\n\"Tough environment to play your first game [as QB1]. And to give [new Ohio State defensive coordinator Matt] Patricia all summer long to prepare? It was like giving a Calculus test to a kindergartner. That was the toughest test [Manning will] face probably all year long.\"\nIt is important to acknowledge Manning\u2019s inexperience and the degree of difficulty he faced against the Buckeyes. Saturday was the first road game of Manning\u2019s college career and just his third start overall. He is 21 years old with two more years of college eligibility remaining.\nFurther, while Ohio State had eight defenders drafted into the NFL a year ago, the 2025 Buckeyes have reloaded and are once again loaded with talent. Two-time All-American safety Caleb Downs is arguably the best defender in the country and, as just acknowledged, Patricia looked every bit a former NFL head coach and Super Bowl champion playcaller in his Columbus debut.\n\"Ohio State\u2019s secondary is very good,\" a scout said. \"In a couple years, you\u2019ll see all of them in the league.\"\nAnd make no mistake, while Manning\u2019s sticky feet and sidearm throws had scouts grumbling, they also acknowledged the flashes. Two throws, in particular, had the scouts excited, starting with a strike in the hole of two-deep coverage to tight end Jack Endries.\n\"That was a legitimate NFL throw,\" a scout said. \"He read the coverage and threaded the needle. [Patrick] Mahomes doesn\u2019t place that one any better.\"\nThe touchdown pass to Parker Livingstone was a pretty toss, as well, with Manning throwing his receiver open again.\nUltimately, scouts cautioned against making too much of Manning\u2019s disappointing season debut. They preached patience and recognized the complexity of Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian\u2019s pro-style offense, which might limit some of Manning\u2019s statistics but better prepare him for the rigors of the NFL than many of the schemes popular in today\u2019s college football landscape.\nWhen reminded of how good other QBs in the 2026 draft class looked this weekend, they scoffed at the idea of draft boards dramatically changing as a result of one game.\n\"I can\u2019t speak for every scout obviously, but [Saturday\u2019s game] won\u2019t change anything for me,\" the NFC scout explained. \"It\u2019s just too early in the process. We\u2019re still establishing a baseline of who the prospect is. I don\u2019t care whether his last name is Manning, Smith or Jones, he\u2019s got a long way to go.\"\n\"He\u2019ll be fine,\" the AFC scout reassured. \"Sark will coach him up. You guys [media] made the mistake of overhyping him based on two games last year. Don\u2019t make the same mistake of doubting him now based on one bad game to start this year.\"\nRob Rang is an NFL Draft analyst for FOX Sports.

      "text": "First impressions aren\u2019t everything to Texas\u2019 Steve Sarkisian and he urges the sports landscape to apply that to Arch Manning.\nThe grandson of Archie and nephew of Eli and Peyton had his first start as the No. 1-ranked team\u2019s quarterback on Saturday to kick off the 2025 season.\nHe left a lot to be desired, but to Sarkisian, it\u2019s not all Manning will show throughout the season.\n\u201cFor Arch, the expectations were out of control on the outside. I\u2019d say let\u2019s finish the book before we judge him. That\u2019s one chapter,\u201d the head coach said.\nBefore his debut, there was lofty expectations placed on Manning due to his family history.\nHe waited two years for the starting gig at Texas, despite the temptations of the transfer portal, and he was a big reason why Texas was ranked No. 1 in the preseason for the first time in program history.\nManning went 17-of-30 for 170 yards with one touchdown and one interception.\nIt was an underwhelming and inconsistent performance given the hype around him as a popular pick for the Heisman Trophy and as a potential No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft.\nIt resulted in a 14-7 loss, but Ohio State has a tough defense and Ohio Staadium isn\u2019t the easiest place to play.\nMoving forward, Manning is expected to look better against lighter competition.\nThe team faces San Jose State and UTEP over the next two weeks, which should give some more early season experimenting for Texas around their new star quarterback.\n\u201cHe started really playing and we saw some flashes and glimpses of the guy he is,\u201d Sarkisian said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to hold onto on what the future is going to look like here for Arch Manning.\u201d"

      "text": "Arch Manning is well aware that his play on Saturday against No. 3 Ohio State was not where it needed to be.\nThe Texas quarterback said as much on Monday when he spoke with reporters following the Longhorns\u2019 14-7 Week 1 loss to the Buckeyes, where the newly minted starter completed 17 of his 30 pass attempts for 170 yards, a touchdown and an interception.\nManning \u2013 a member of one of football\u2019s great families \u2013 was not happy with the start he got off to in the game against the defending national champions.\n\u201cI hold myself to a high standard,\u201d Manning told reporters, according to ESPN. \u201cI\u2019ve got to play better, got to lead more, got to get our guys to play well around me and ultimately I wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\nPart of the issue for Manning was that he didn\u2019t seem comfortable until the second half, when Texas put up 260 yards of offense, but still only managed to score seven points.\nManning said he \u201clet it rip a little more\u201d in the second half and that he has to \u201cstart that sooner.\u201d\nWith the last name Manning \u2014 shared with football legends in grandfather Archie and uncles Peyton and Eli \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of expectation and pressure on the sophomore quarterback and he said the performance on Saturday will motivate him going into the Longhorns\u2019 second game of the year against San Jose State.\n\u201cI\u2019m determined,\u201d Manning said. \u201cI think this is going to motivate me to play better and that\u2019s what we need to win.\u201d\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian did notice little details in Manning\u2019s game that will need to be addressed, though it seemed like they were things that will come with time and familiarity with his receivers.\n\u201cThere were a couple times where we had some crossing routes where I didn\u2019t feel like he brought his feet to where he wanted to throw the ball, which in turn forced kind of a little bit more of a sidearm delivery, which isn\u2019t his style of throwing,\u201d Sarkisian said. \u201cPart of that is just finding that comfort level of trust with receivers in real games \u2014 not in practice, not against the scout team, but in a real game \u2014 against a good defense because the windows get small against good defenses like that. So definitely lesson learned on that stuff.\u201d"

I\u2019ve got to play better for us to win.\u201d\nManning, who is taking over for Dolphins rookie Quinn Ewers, has entered this season with tons of hype, being one of the primary reasons behind Texas\u2019 No. 1 preseason ranking for the first time in the program\u2019s history.\nDespite the ugly showing from Manning, Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian defended him, saying that there is still a lot of season left.\n\u201cThe expectations were out of control on the outside, but I\u2019d say let\u2019s finish the book before we judge it,\u201d Sarkisian told reporters following the road loss. \u201cThis is one chapter, and we have a long season to play.\u201d\nSarkisian also noted that Manning was confused by Ohio State\u2019s defense and how he \u201cshifted his focus\u201d on recognizing coverages following a halftime discussion.\n\u201cHe was struggling to see some things early,\u201d Sarkisian said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a smart secondary and a good scheme. They made Arch work.\u201d\n\u201cHe started really playing [in the second half] and we saw some flashes and glimpses of the guy he is,\u201d Sarkisian added. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to hold onto on what the future is going to look like here for Arch Manning.\u201d\nManning\u2019s next chance to make his mark for the Longhorns will be on Sept. 6 against San Jose State, a much weaker opponent than the Buckeyes."

      "text": "US Olympic legend Greg Louganis sells his medals, home to start a new life abroad: \u2018I needed the money\u2019\nHe is making his boldest leap yet.\nUS Olympic legend Greg Louganis has parted with his California home and three of his cherished Olympic medals to launch a bold new chapter of life abroad.\nThe diving icon, 65, who is widely acclaimed as possibly the greatest diver in history, revealed that he \u201cneeded the money\u201d from his house and medals to be able to start afresh overseas.\nLouganis, who won five Olympic medals between 1976 and 1988, revealed that he had bid adieu to the US and relocated to Panama.\n\u201cSo, as life moves forward, what are you prepared to leave behind?\u201d he wrote on Facebook over the weekend.\n\u201cI am 65 years old, and I am asking just that. I am no longer who I used to think I was. Not even close to \u2018What\u2019 other people or \u2018Who\u2019 other people think I am.\u201d\nThe retired athlete revealed that he sold two gold Olympic medals and one silver medal in an auction \u2014 and the combined $437,000 he made from the sale exceeded all of his expectations.\n\u201cI have auctioned three of my medals, which sold, I believe, because I went against what the \u2018experts\u2019 told me last time when I tried the first time,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cI told the truth; I needed the money. While many people may have built businesses and sold them for a profit, I had my medals, which I am grateful for.\u201d\n\u201cThe other consideration is the sale of my house. I am VERY happy with whom I sold it to,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cI thanked and blessed the house to bring joy, love, peace, happiness, and a sense of safety to those who entered the house.\u201d\nIn addition to the medals and his home, Louganis revealed that he sold a lot of his personal belongings after several of his close friends lost their possessions in the deadly Woolsey and Palisades wildfires earlier this year.\n\u201cI know I am choosing to do this, but their resilience is an inspiration for me to start anew, with an open heart and an open door. Opening up to possibilities,\u201d he went on.\n\u201cI realized I often close myself off, shut myself down, and play small for the comfort of others. I don\u2019t think I have realized or given myself credit for what I might be able to accomplish.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said in an earlier post, \u2018I was an instrument of my coach\u2019s, Ron O\u2019Brien\u2019s, creation.\u2019 I was honored, proud, and blessed to have been that for him. It was all achieved with love at the core,\u201d he added.\nLouganis said his new life in Panama will force him to go on a journey of self-discovery.\n\u201cNow I get to discover who is Greg Louganis? Without the distraction and noise from outside. At least this is my goal, and hey, I may not find that.\u201d\n\u201cI think I may find it at times, in moments, my goal is to live it! Discover, allow, and nurture that human spirit through the experiences of life,\u201d he added.\nThe diving legend\u2019s career spanned across three Olympic Games: Montreal in 1976, Los Angeles in 1984 and Seoul in 1988.\nThe athlete racked up a total of five Olympic medals throughout his glittering career, including four gold medals and one silver.\nLouganis is the only man to win consecutive Olympic titles in springboard and platform diving \u2014 in 1984 and 1988.\nAfter retiring from the sport, Louganis tried his hand at acting, motivational speaking and offered up sports commentary.\nAfter his diving career ended, Louganis revealed he was gay in 1994 and announced he was HIV-positive a year later."
