      "text": "It's time to celebrate, Severance fans: Apple has renewed the mind-bending workplace thriller for a third season. The series stars Adam Scott and hails from creator and writer Dan Erickson, and director and executive producer Ben Stiller. The renewal decision is a no-brainer: The cultural phenomenon broke records in its second season, becoming the streamer's most-watched series.\nSeverance follows employee Mark Scout (played by Scott), who leads a team at Lumon Industries. Workers at the company must undergo a controversial procedure to sever their brains so memories from their work lives and personal lives remain separate. As the experiment remains under the proverbial microscope, Mark and his team find themselves grappling with a crises of identity as a central mystery regarding their work, lives and Lumon itself unfolds around them.\n\"Making Severance has been one of the most creatively exciting experiences I've ever been a part of,\" Stiller said in a statement. \"While I have no memory of this, I'm told making season three will be equally enjoyable, though any recollection of these future events will be forever and irrevocably wiped from my memory as well.\"\n\"I couldn't be more excited to get back to work with Ben, Dan, the incredible cast & crew, Apple and the whole Severance team,\" added Scott. \"Oh hey also - not a huge deal - but if you see my innie, please don't mention any of this to him. Thanks.\"\nCompleting the show's cast are Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, Emmy Award winner John Turturro, Academy Award winner Christopher Walken and Academy and Emmy Award winner Patricia Arquette.\nNews of the renewal comes on the heels of Season 2's finale Cold Harbor, which hit the streamer on Thursday. Now that Severance Season 3 is a go, you've got to wonder how long we'll be waiting until these new episodes drop. There was a three year wait between seasons 1 and 2. Stiller stated on Travis Kelce's New Heights podcast that fans will \"definitely not\" be waiting that long again.\nThat said, we'll still have to wait -- which makes this the perfect time to rewatch the show from the beginning. Severance marathon, anyone? The first two seasons are streaming in full on Apple TV Plus."

      "text": "Pros\n- Low cost\n- Ad-free\n- Top-quality, star-studded originals\n- Mobile downloads\n- 4K HDR and Dolby Vision and Atmos\nCons\n- Very small catalog\n- No older content\n- Unavailable on Android devices\n- Confusing app experience\nApple made its official entry into the streaming wars in November 2019. Apple TV Plus debuted weeks before Disney Plus, putting both streaming services in the competitive spotlight. At $5 a month, Apple TV Plus is the lowest-priced premium, ad-free streaming platform around, but it still packs high-end features like 4K resolution, HDR and mobile downloads -- as well as some of Hollywood's biggest stars, such as Jennifer Aniston, Jason Momoa, Tom Hanks and Samuel L. Jackson.\nOne of the youngest streamers in the game, Apple TV Plus produces high quality, award-winning content. Its feature film CODA earned an Oscar, making it the first streaming service to win Best Picture. While the popular comedy show Ted Lasso has garnered multiple honors, other releases such as The Morning Show, Pachinko, The Tragedy of Macbeth and Severance showcase how Apple TV Plus invests in premium content.\nThe platform now has more than 60 original exclusive TV shows and movies and began streaming its first live sports events with Friday Night Baseball for Major League Baseball's 2022 season. But in some ways, the service is still an underdog. The number of titles on the streamer is tiny compared to Netflix, Disney Plus or HBO Max, in part because Apple TV Plus has almost no back catalog of shows and movies.\nWhether the service is worth $5 a month for you -- or less, depending on whether you get it for free with a new Apple device or a discount as part of Apple's Apple One bundle -- depends on how excited you are to watch those originals. Its biggest breakout hit so far has been Ted Lasso, the Jason Sudeikis dramedy about an American football coach who gets hired to coach an English Premier League soccer team. Shows like Mythic Quest, Severance and Schmigadoon! have also garnered critical praise, but few have made cultural waves the way that, say, The Mandalorian did for Disney Plus.\nAll original content, nothing familiar to binge\nApple's current slate of original shows and movies includes comedies, dramas, documentaries and talk shows. At launch in 2019 it had only nine titles on the whole platform, with a strategy that seemed to be focused on keeping it small and high-quality. Its marquee drama, The Morning Show, which stars Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carrell, had a huge, $300 million reported budget.\nFor a while, that was the closest the platform had to a real breakout -- until Ted Lasso premiered in August 2020 and made the title character the world's midwestern sweetheart. Though Apple doesn't report viewership data, Deadline reported that Ted Lasso became the most-watched show on the platform in 2021 across all top 50 countries and that it greatly increased subscriptions. Other originals at launch included the postapocalyptic thriller See starring Jason Momoa, the alternative retelling of the space program For All Mankind and the Hailee Steinfeld-starring comedy Dickinson about poet Emily Dickinson.\nNew additions include the sci-fi spectacle Foundation, book adaptation The Last Days of Ptolemy Gray, historical drama Pachinko and the genre-bending series Severance. You'll find a few selections for kids, like Snoopy in Space, Luck, Amber Brown, and Hello, Jack! The Kindness Show but the catalog is definitely more adult-oriented.\nThough you won't find a treasure trove of blockbuster films on the service, Apple Original Films partners with the studio A24 for theatrical and streaming productions. For example, The Tragedy of Macbeth debuted in movie theaters in December 2021 and landed on Apple TV Plus the following January. During Apple's Peek Performance event in March, the company announced a slate of new upcoming films and series. Viewers can soon watch Killers of the Flower Moon from Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese; the star-studded Argylle, featuring Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa and Samuel L. Jackson; and the Christmas comedy Spirited, starring Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds.\nMost Apple TV Plus series initially premiere a few episodes at once, followed by one new episode each week to keep you hooked. But sometimes the service drops a full season in one go, similar to Netflix. Ultimately the platform is hurt by its lack of a back catalog -- especially compared with NBC's streaming service, Peacock, which has a free tier with 13,000 hours of shows that include bingeable favorites like Parks and Recreation and 30 Rock.\nApple's strategy appears to be shifting. The company started acquiring older movies and TV shows to round out the service, but this remains very limited. So far, all we have is the 1980s Jim Henson TV series Fraggle Rock, as a complement to its own new series of shorts based on the show. But there hasn't been any other news about what an expanded back catalog will look like, or how it'll compare to those of competitors.\nAfter adding Friday night games from Major League Baseball to its service earlier this year, the company seems to be leveling up its live sports offerings. In June, Apple struck a 10-year deal with Major League Soccer to stream matches on the Apple TV app. The catch? Only selected games will be available for Apple TV Plus subscribers.\nRead more: Best TV Shows on Apple TV Plus\nTop-tier features at a low price, but no Android phone or tablet support\nYou can't really beat Apple TV Plus in terms of the features. Its originals are available in 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos sound. Like Netflix, it's completely ad-free. You can share your subscription with up to five other people on your Apple Family plan and stream on up to six devices at once. You can download all shows to your mobile device to watch offline as well. It's available in 100 countries.\nYou can watch Apple TV Plus on any Apple device (iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac), via AirPlay or SharePlay. You can also watch on your PC, Roku devices, Amazon Fire TV devices, Samsung, Panasonic, LG and Vizio smart TVs, as well as on the web at tv.apple.com.\nDevice support is narrower than most other major services, however. Apple TV Plus isn't available on any mobile devices except for iPhones and iPads, so owners of Android phones and tablets are out of luck. Since launch, Apple has added support for the PlayStation and Xbox -- and it does support some Android-powered TV devices, namely Chromecast with Google TV and Sony smart TVs.\nRead more: New to Apple TV Plus? Here Are 9 of Its Coolest Hidden Features\nSmall selection, small price\nBesides offering first-rate content, Apple TV Plus is attractive due to its low monthly price. For less than the cost of your average McDonald's combo meal, you can access every title on the platform for $5 per month. There are also a few ways to use the service for free.\nNew users can hop on a free seven-day trial or try out the service for free for 30 days with an Apple One bundle. The Apple One package allows you to have up to six Apple services depending on your account type. Additionally, if you purchase a new Apple device, you can receive Apple TV Plus free for three months, as long as you redeem the offer within 90 days. And if you have a T-Mobile Magenta wireless plan, the service is included for free for one year.\nWith the $5 monthly subscription to Apple TV Plus, up to six people can stream from one account and you can hold watch parties on FaceTime. Content is what will hold your attention, but compared to the world's other top streaming services like Netflix and Disney Plus, the price is right.\nStreaming Services Compared\n| Apple TV Plus | Netflix | HBO Max | Disney Plus | Hulu | Amazon Prime Video | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Monthly price | $5 | Starts at $10 | $10 for basic with ads, $15 for ad-free | $8 | Basic $7 with ads, ad-free Premium for $13, Live TV for $70 | $9 (or included with $120-per-year Prime membership) |\n| Ads | No | No | No | No | Yes | No |\n| Top titles | Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, CODA, Severance | Stranger Things, Squid Game, Bridgerton, Ozark, Money Heist | Game of Thrones, Dune, Euphoria, DC titles | The Mandalorian, Loki, Encanto, The Simpsons | Handmaid's Tale, Pen15, Lost, Bob's Burgers | Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, The Boys, Reacher, The Wheel of Time |\n| Mobile downloads | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| 4K HDR available | Yes | Yes (on Premium plan) | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Number of streams: | 6 | 1 (2 for Standard, 4 on Premium) | 3 | 4 | 2 (Unlimited with Live TV $9.99 add-on) | 2 |\nA confusing app experience\nApple TV Plus differs from other streaming services in that it doesn't live in its own app. Instead, you'll find the service inside the Apple TV app, alongside programming from other video subscriptions, as well as Apple iTunes movie and TV rentals and purchases.\nIn practice we found this arrangement confusing. When you enter the Apple TV app, the format is similar to other streaming services, letting you search by movies, TV shows, sports or kids. Though Apple TV Plus content is highlighted at the top of the screen, you'll see Apple TV originals mixed in with a ton of content available a la carte to buy, as well as stuff from other streaming services. At first glance, it looks like Apple TV comes with all of these shows and movies -- until you click on them and are taken to a purchase page.\nTo see only Apple TV Plus content, you'll have to scroll to the Channels section of the app and click Apple TV Plus, which you'll find alongside others like Showtime, Starz and many others.\nWithin the channel, you'll see every show, but navigation isn't perfect. You'll find the following categories: latest originals, book adaptations, entire seasons, drama and comedy series, feature films, nonfiction series, kids and family... and that's it. No search bar, and no bar across the top where you can scroll between TV shows, movies and kids' programs that are strictly the Apple TV Plus brand, as you typically see with other streaming services. However, if you're using a mobile device such as an iPad or iPhone, there's an \"Originals\" icon at the bottom of the screen you can click to find branded content in that category.\nYou'll find the latest available trailers in the Coming Soon section, which is nice to give you an idea of what to look forward to. You'll also see a section called More From the Stars of Apple TV Plus, with black-and-white tiles of some of the big names on the platform (like Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington). Clicking one of those will take you to the Apple TV Plus show you can watch them in, as well as all of their other shows and movies on other platforms. Sort of handy, but ultimately not doing much more than IMDb in terms of connecting you to someone's body of work -- and then asking you to pay for it.\nOnce you select a show you'll see a large photo and the option to play the first episode or add it to your list. Underneath this section, you can scroll through the list of episodes for each season with or without having to use the drop-down menu.\nThe Apple TV Plus voice experience worked best on Apple TV and Roku. When on the home screen of either streaming box, when we said something like, \"Watch Defending Jacob,\" the device would automatically open the Apple TV app and start the pilot episode, no second action needed. On the Amazon Fire TV stick, the voice command took us to another menu, where we'd have to manually select the show to watch. Otherwise, the experience was very similar across platforms.\nBeing a part of the Apple ecosystem can enhance your experience with the iPhone version: Under a More to Explore tab, you'll find show soundtracks and playlists in Apple Music and related books in Apple Books.\nShould you get Apple TV Plus?\nIf you've bought an Apple device over the past year, or plan to do so once the iPhone 14 is released this fall, you're eligible for the free trial of Apple TV Plus -- and you should definitely take advantage of it. You (or your family) will likely find something you'd like to watch among the original shows and movies.\nI'd recommend the free trial to see if any of Apple's originals strike your interest. (We can confirm that seven days is long enough to finish the first season of Ted Lasso.) If they do, $5 a month really isn't much to pay for high-quality content -- especially when most streaming services like Netflix are implementing price increases."

      "text": "So, you've got Apple TV Plus and you're looking for some solid sci-fi TV shows to add to your watchlist. Well, look no further. Before you ask, yes, Severance is on this list. But that groundbreaking series is just the tip of the genre iceberg. Want to know more? Well, please, read on.\nIt's no secret that Apple's streaming service (which just raised its monthly price) has flown under the radar for some time. It feels like many of the streamer's titles show up on the platform without much promotion, waiting for you to discover them for yourself. There is some fun in that. But it can be easy to get stuck in the thick of things, without a clear understanding of which TV show to click play on.\nOne thing I've noticed with Apple TV Plus's original programming is that every show -- whether it's a light-hearted space jaunt or dystopian drama -- features detailed world-building, creative storytelling and engaging performances. Sci-fi shows such as For All Mankind, Murderbot and Dark Matter immediately come to mind. And, yes, there's always Severance.\nBelow, you'll find CNET's guide to the best sci-fi shows to watch on Apple TV Plus right now. You could be in the mood for a neo-noir mystery, an epic monster battle or something with a scientific flair. There are choices, choices, choices -- so settle in and click play.\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.\nRead more: Apple TV Plus Review: Small Library but the Quality Is Top-Notch\nInvasion\nInvasion is an epic sci-fi drama about an alien invasion. The detail that makes this series different is its international scope. Now in its third season, the show travels around the world to offer a variety of perspectives on the global threat. The events in the series takes place in real time, adding a sense of urgency to the mix.\nMurderbot\nThe adaptation of Martha Wells' bestselling book series, Murderbot Diaries, has already carved a unique niche in Apple TV Plus's sci-fi library. Starring Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd (who delivers in everything he's in) as the murder-y bot in question, the program follows the exploits of a security bot who protects his human clients while secretly watching hours upon hours of TV. If you want action, comedy and science fiction, Murderbot delivers all three.\nDr. Brain\nAll six episodes of Dr. Brain were directed by Kim Jee-woon (the director behind I Saw the Devil), which pretty much tells you that this show will be a dark and twisted ride. The series follows a brain scientist named Sewon Koh, who's found a way to hack into the memories of dead people. This is a medical breakthrough, to be sure, but Sewon is more focused on using this experimental technique to solve the mystery behind a family tragedy.\nSunny\nRashida Jones stars as Suzie in Sunny, a series Apple TV Plus describes as a dark comedy. After Suzie's husband and child mysteriously disappear, she is given a robot to help her grieve. As the show unfolds, Suzie begins to learn her husband's secrets, leading the program to take a darkly dramatic turn. Presented in a sleek, near-future lens, Sunny feels very Black Mirror-y, which is a good thing.\nSeverance\nIf Ted Lasso set the stage for quirky comedies on the platform, Severance has to be the title that cemented Apple TV Plus as a streamer devoted to high-concept genre programming. The series follows Mark (Adam Scott), who works for Lumon Industries, a biotech firm that has a unique (albeit terrifying) system to maintain its employees' work-life balance. Ben Stiller executive produces and directs most of the first season's episodes, proving once again he's a stellar talent behind the camera.\nHello Tomorrow!\nHello Tomorrow! takes place in a retro-future where door-to-door salesmen sell real estate on the moon. The world-building is one of the biggest draws of the series, which unfortunately didn't get a season 2 renewal. Billy Crudup, Allison Pill, Dawshane Williams, Hank Azaria and Susan Heyward make up the show's strong cast.\nFor All Mankind\nWhat would life be like if the space race never stopped? That's the big question For All Mankind answers. The prestige sci-fi drama occurs in an alternate reality where America and the Soviets compete for outer-space dominance. Thanks to the always creative vision of show creator Ronald D. Moore and the committed performances of its epic ensemble cast, this is probably the best science fiction series you're not watching.\nDark Matter\nWhat if we did things differently? We've all asked ourselves that question at least once throughout our lives. That question comes to life in Dark Matter, a high-concept twisted series based on Blake Crouch's book. The series stars Joel Edgerton as Jason, a college professor who suffers a strange assault that alters his life and reality. Jennifer Connelly, Jimmi Simpson and Alice Braga co-star alongside him in a show that'll keep you guessing until the season's finale.\nMonarch: Legacy of Monsters\nThe Godzilla universe finally came to TV in this Apple TV Plus series. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters seeks to reveal the organization's secrets as they connect to the monsters who leveled San Francisco. Kurt Russell stars in his first role in a TV series in nearly five decades. Here, he and his son Wyatt play Army officer Lee Shaw in the 1950s and present day. The monsters and Russell's star power alone are reasons enough to tune in.\nThe Last Days of Ptolemy Grey\nSamuel L. Jackson pivots away from the superhero genre to bring topics of age and dementia to the forefront. Here, he plays Ptolemy Grey, an aging man with Alzheimer's. Thanks to the support of an orphaned teen and the progressive research of an extraordinary doctor, Ptolemy can regain his wits to get closure in his own life while also looking for answers to his nephew's sudden death.\nSilo\nUsing Hugh Howey's book trilogy as inspiration, Silo explores a dystopian future world where humanity's survivors live in an underground structure. Varied classist drama permeates the underground city. Population control, a murder mystery and the potentially lethal world outside keep the show humming. Rebecca Ferguson, Common and Tim Robbins lead the ensemble cast.\nFoundation\nApple TV Plus did the unthinkable in adapting Isaac Asimov's epic sci-fi book series. But the streamer pulled it off. Jared Harris plays Hari Seldon, an exiled math professor, for predicting the fall of the Galactic Empire. Lee Pace delivers a formidable performance as Brother Day. The space drama follows Seldon and his followers as they fight to save humanity.\nSee\nJason Momoa flexes his acting chops in See. The program, created by Peaky Blinders mastermind Steven Knight, explores a dystopian future where humanity has lost the ability to see. The loss of sight doesn't slow down people's ability to battle, and it surely is a spectacle to see blind warriors wield weapons for war. Momoa's charisma and passion shine through, which makes the show enjoyable, even if it is a hard-to-believe concept.\nSugar\nMark Protosevich, the writer responsible for movies like Thor, I Am Legend and The Cell, created Sugar -- a series that wears its love for the film noir genre on its sleeve. Visually, Sugar is a delight. Add Colin Farrell's soft-spoken, empathetic private investigator to the mix, and you have a stylish murder mystery with patience and compassion. An unexpected twist flips the show on its head later in the series, transforming the story into something else entirely."

      "text": "How do movies get greenlit in Hollywood?\nSeth Rogen stars in The Studio as Matt Remick, a man whose job is to make things happen in filmmaking. As the newly appointed person in charge at Continental Studios, Remick is not only in pursuit of creating great movies but also grappling with stress, egos and executive bigwigs who are all part of the process. It's a world where bringing projects to life can be productive, satisfying and destructive.\nHe's not the only one under pressure: Continental Studios' team is driven but prone to conflict, and it's part of the job to be on edge whether it's on set, at an industry event or in their own building. The series features a packed cast and parade of cameos, including Kathryn Hahn, Catherine O'Hara, Ike Barinholtz, Chase Sui Wonders, Bryan Cranston, Anthony Mackie, Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, Keyla Monterroso Mejia, Steve Buscemi, Ice Cube, Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Zack Snyder, Antony Starr, Quinta Brunson, Dewayne Perkins and Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos.\nScroll on to learn the episodic release schedule for The Studio and more streaming details about the series.\nRead more: Best Streaming Services of 2025\nWhen to watch The Studio on Apple TV Plus\nThe Studio will drop its third episode on Apple TV Plus on Wednesday, April 2. The remaining eight episodes will stream on the platform each Wednesday until the season 1 finale on May 21.\nIf you don't have an Apple device, sign up for the service via Prime Video channels or on your Android device.\nIf you want to watch The Studio, you'll need a subscription to Apple TV Plus. The service costs $10 a month, and if you're a new subscriber, you can get a seven-day free trial. For those who purchased a new Apple device, three months of Apple TV Plus is free, as long as you redeem the offer within 90 days.\nHow to watch The Studio from anywhere with a VPN\nIf you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with your favorite shows or movies while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds; they can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins.\nVPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN usage to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance.\nIf you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying whether your streaming subscription allows VPN usage is crucial.\nExpressVPN is our current pick for the most secure and reliable VPN service. It's fast, works across multiple devices and offers stable streams. ExpressVPN is normally $13 a month, but you can save money with an annual plan. There's also a 30-day money-back guarantee."

      "text": "Apple's annual fall iPhone launch event is just around the corner. Last week, the company sent out invites for its fall keynote, which is slated for Sept. 9 at 10 a.m. PT. Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup, which could include a slimmer version of the phone, as well as the Apple Watch Series 11 and the AirPods Pro 3.\nThe invite shows the title \"Awe dropping,\" with a glowing Apple logo that seems to reference Siri's colorful glow. There's also an interactive element when you view the invite on Apple.com. With a finger (phone or tablet) or a mouse/trackpad pointer (computer), you can move across the logo and watch the colors go from a cool blue to a vivid orange, possibly evoking the Liquid Glass design element in iOS 26, which exhibits light-bending qualities across apps and functions. You can read more theories about what the fall event invite might signify.\nThe keynote will be held at Apple Park in Cupertino, California. CNET will be covering the announcements live, so be sure to follow along.\nHow to watch Apple's iPhone 17 reveal\nTechnically, Apple has yet to confirm the iPhone 17, but the company's fall event is where it typically unveils its latest handsets.\nYou can tune into the iPhone 17 event live by watching the official livestream on the Apple website or via the livestream on Apple's YouTube channel. Those streams are scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on Sept. 9, 2025. CNET's reporters will also be on the ground and bringing you all the updates.\nWhat might Apple be cooking up?\nRumors for the upcoming slate of iPhones have been plentiful. Stealing the spotlight is the supposed iPhone 17 Air, which could follow in the footsteps of Samsung's sleek Galaxy S25 Edge and have a slim profile and lightweight design. The Pro model could get a scratch-resistant antireflective display and an 8x telephoto lens, and the Pro Max could pack a bigger battery. The baseline iPhone 17 could also boast a higher refresh rate. It's possible that all the phones may include an Apple-developed 5G modem called the C1 chip, which debuted on the iPhone 16E, as well as in-house Wi-Fi chips.\nWe also expect to learn more about the public rollout of iOS 26 later this fall. The new operating system features a Liquid Glass interface that brings a more transparent, lens-like look to the iPhone and other Apple devices. The Camera app also gets a more minimalistic design, Messages lets you create polls in group chats and a new screening tool can better detect spam texts. You can check out all the features coming to iOS 26.\nWill there be a Siri overhaul?\nWhat we might not hear as much about is the updated version of Siri that Apple unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference last year. The smarter version of the AI assistant has faced repeated delays and may not arrive until next year or even later. But Apple could discuss other Apple Intelligence updates and features arriving on its new devices.\nCNET's reporters will be on the ground on Sept. 9, bringing you all the latest updates and impressions of whatever Apple has in store."
