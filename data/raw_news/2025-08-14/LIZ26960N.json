  "description": "Rumor Replay this week covers a new Apple TV 4K chip, Studio Display 2 surprise, M5 MacBook Pro with cellular, and much more.",
  "content": "This is Rumor Replay, a weekly column at 9to5Mac offering a quick rundown of the most recent Apple product rumors, with analysis and commentary. This week\u2019s rumors include: new Apple TV 4K chip, Studio Display 2 surprise, M5 MacBook Pro with cellular, and much more.\n\nApple TV 4K getting A17 Pro, plus more surprise chip leaks\n\nThanks to leaked Apple code and the discoveries of Aaron Perris, MacRumors published a variety of new leaks about chips coming to future Apple products.\n\u2022 new Apple TV 4K this fall will receive an A17 Pro chip\n\u2022 Vision Pro 2 will come with an M5 chip, up from the current M2\n\nAdditionally, Filipe Esposito at Macworld says an M4 Ultra chip is in development for Apple\u2019s new Mac Pro.\n\nThis big batch of chip leaks largely just confirms what we might expect from Apple\u2019s forthcoming products. Rumors already said the new Apple TV 4K would get an A17 Pro or A18 for Apple Intelligence support. Vision Pro 2 has been predicted to get an M5 before too.\n\nBut the Studio Display 2 getting an A19 Pro easily stands out as the most fascinating reveal for me.\n\nBack in July 2023, Bloomberg reported that Apple had a new Mac monitor in the works that would double as a smart home display when idle. Considering what we\u2019ve been hearing about Apple\u2019s smart home ambitions, the inclusion of an A19 Pro makes me think that rumor\u2019s about to come true.\n\nTwo noteworthy updates arrived this week for the M5 MacBook Pro:\n\u2022 First, Filipe Esposito found evidence that Apple is testing a C1 cellular modem in the M5 MacBook Pro\n\u2022 Second, Ming-Chi Kuo claimed the product is coming in 2026, not this fall as had long been hoped\n\nMark Gurman also followed Kuo\u2019s report by saying the MacBook Pro would launch \u201cvery early\u201d in 2026.\n\nPrior expectations were that the first cellular Mac wouldn\u2019t arrive until late 2026, with the M6 MacBook Pro possibly gaining a next-gen C2 modem.\n\nIt\u2019s still very possible that will be the case. But the fact that Apple seems to be testing C1 in the M5 MacBook Pro is encouraging. One way or another, it sounds like cellular Macs are truly happening at long last.\n\nBloomberg reported that Apple\u2019s new home product ambitions include building \u201cmultiple types of cameras and home-security products as part of an entirely new hardware and software lineup.\u201d\n\nLaunching first on the security front will be a new 2026 security camera that\u2019s battery powered and should last \u201cfrom several months to a year\u201d with a single charge. Per Gurman:\n\nApple\u2019s investment in home products has until now proven a disappointment. HomePod and Apple TV 4K are extremely niche market players. But the smart home landscape is still messy enough that Apple has a great shot at finding true success.\n\nWith security cameras, a rumored video doorbell, and the upcoming HomePad/HomePod Touch and tabletop robot\u2014potentially all supercharged by AI\u2014Apple Home could be in for big things.\n\nMark Gurman also said this week that Siri will be given a complete visual overhaul as early as next year.\n\nSiri has a variety of powerful upgrades coming in iOS 26.4, and per Gurman they may be accompanied by a brand new look for the assistant.\n\nThis new Siri appearance might resemble the Mac\u2019s Finder icon, but design testing is ongoing. It\u2019s also possible the new look won\u2019t debut until 2027, as part of Apple\u2019s tabletop robot product that\u2019s set to give Siri greater conversational abilities.\n\nLast year in iOS 18.1, Apple shipped a new Siri interface but with minimal new features backing up the change.\n\nNow that Siri\u2019s more compelling AI upgrades seem to be tracking for a big iOS 26.4 update in the spring, overhauling Siri\u2019s design makes a lot of sense. I also like the idea of taking inspiration from the Finder for this new and improved Siri.\n\nWhat are your takeaways from this week\u2019s Apple rumors? Let us know in the comments.\n\u2022 AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)",

      "text": "A brand new Studio Display 2 is coming soon, and per a code leak, it looks set to boast a far more powerful chip than you might expect. Here are the details.\nStudio Display 2 will come with A19 Pro chip, per code leak\nOver the past day, MacRumors has shared chip details on several forthcoming products. The details are the result of an Apple code leak uncovered by Aaron Perris.\nCode has revealed that the new Apple TV 4K will have an A17 Pro chip, while Vision Pro 2 gets an M5.\nAnother significant leak arrived this morning for Apple\u2019s next Studio Display, which is rumored to arrive in early 2026.\nIt says that the Studio Display 2 will come equipped with an A19 Pro chip.\nApple currently doesn\u2019t sell any products with the A19 Pro, but it\u2019s expected to launch in the iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max, and Air next month.\nThis chip is noteworthy not just because it\u2019s currently unreleased, but also because it seems overpowered for what you might expect an external monitor to need.\nThe first-gen Apple Studio Display uses an A13 Bionic, for example. It launched in early 2022, and the A13 by that time had been around for years already, debuting in 2019.\nCould Apple have powerful new features coming to the Studio Display 2 that will require the A19 Pro\u2019s power? It certainly seems so.\nOn that note, the next base model iPad is reportedly getting an A18 chip which should enable Apple Intelligence.\nMaybe some version of Apple Intelligence will be supported by the new Studio Display, such as the rumored Siri overhaul coming next spring.\nWhat do you make of the Studio Display 2 getting such a powerful chip?

The findings reveal the internal identifier t8152, which matches the \u201cM4 Ultra\u201d scheme and also goes by the codename \u201cHidra.\u201d\nThe presence of the M4 Ultra in the Mac Pro does help explain the product\u2019s delayed appearance.\nWhen Apple launched its new Mac Studio, it surprised many by launching M3 and M4 variants.\nCuriously, the M4 Max is in many respects the less powerful option, while the upsell gets you an M3 Ultra.\nThe absence of an M4 Ultra marked the first time Apple had launched a new product with two different generations of chip.\nSome guessed that this meant Apple simply wouldn\u2019t make an Ultra chip for the M4 line. But it seems the chip\u2019s just taking longer than anticipated.\nAn M4 Ultra would certainly give the new Mac Pro an edge over the Mac Studio, and solve the problem of minimal differentiation between the two products. But it also wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Apple starts selling an M4 Ultra Mac Studio once the chip debuts on the Mac Pro.\nAre you interested in getting a Mac Pro with M4 Ultra?

      "text": "Apple is gearing up for a new investment in the smart home that\u2019s coming soon, and according to changes in the latest tvOS 26 beta, it seems part of that may be the replacing of the HomeKit brand with a fresh, unified name.\n\u2018Apple Home\u2019 looks set to be the new branding for smart home products and technology\nRumors last fall indicated 2025 would be a big year for Apple and the smart home.\nThis was expected to kick off in March with a brand new product: a smart display that\u2019s like a mix between an iPad and HomePod.\nThat product, however, was delayed indefinitely because it relied in large part on the Siri upgrades that were expected this spring but didn\u2019t arrive on time.\nApple does still have two new Home products coming this year: a new Apple TV 4K and HomePod mini 2.\nBut the smart display\u2014which may be called HomePod Touch\u2014is now slated for 2026 alongside other new Home devices.\nAhead of this flurry of new Home products\u2014likely two this fall, and at least three in 2026\u2014it seems Apple is planning to streamline branding for its smart home offerings.\nThe Verifier reported that tvOS 26 beta 5, which arrived last week, replaced references to \u2018HomeKit\u2019 in the Settings app with a new term: \u2018Apple Home.\u2019\nIt seems Apple Home will be the new, unified branding for all things smart home related.\nTop comment by CarAnalogy\nHomeKit would still be the backend the way they other APIs and backend systems have names like that. Changing the name in the interface is fine. Matches the other branding.\nAnd HomeKit could, as early as next month, start using this new branding too.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Apple wants to strengthen and simplify its branding around smart home-related initiatives.\nHere\u2019s hoping the apparent phasing out of the \u2018HomeKit\u2019 term does truly bring a stronger, more focused smart home strategy to accompany Apple\u2019s forthcoming products.\nWhat do you think of Apple replacing \u2018HomeKit\u2019 with \u2018Apple Home\u2019?

      "text": "Siri is overdue for some major AI upgrades. They were originally set to arrive earlier this year, but have been pushed into 2026 instead. But according to a recent report, it sounds like they could truly be worth the wait.\nSiri is getting a complete overhaul in iOS 26.4, powered by LLMs\nIf you follow AI developments very closely, you\u2019ll know that while other tech companies are regularly shipping new advancements, Apple\u2019s AI output has been lacking.\nThere are plenty of solid Apple Intelligence features currently available, but Siri has been a pain point.\nSiri got a few minor upgrades in iOS 18, but the biggest changes are now expected in iOS 26.4 next spring.\nThese include:\n- App Intents for truly hands-free computing\n- \u2019LLM Siri\u2019\n- Personal context knowledge\n- On-screen awareness\nBloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman recently highlighted the potential impact of these changes: \u201cIf Apple nails this, it\u2019s not just a nice ease-of-use upgrade \u2014 it\u2019s the fulfillment of the vision Siri promised nearly 15 years ago.\u201d\nTaken together, these upgrades amount to a total overhaul for Siri.\nApple will greatly expand not only what Siri can do, but also how it all happens thanks to an LLM-based architecture.\nLike we saw at WWDC last year, Siri will be able to take action inside of apps, and across apps, without you ever lifting a finger. Per Gurman, \u201cEssentially, Siri [will] operate your apps like you would \u2014 with precision, inside their own interfaces.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t just about making Siri smarter. It\u2019s about giving Apple\u2019s ecosystem a new, voice-first interface. If the company is actually able to bring it to market (and that\u2019s a gigantic if), it could potentially be a hit that many users didn\u2019t see coming.\nWhat\u2019s being described sounds like a truly \u201cnew era\u201d for Siri.\nA new era for Siri that\u2019s truly compelling\nImagine the intelligence of ChatGPT, but unleashed on all the apps on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Vision Pro, and more. And with knowledge of how you normally use your devices.\nThat\u2019s the new Siri being promised.\nThese capabilities certainly expose the heightened importance of user privacy compared to competing AI offerings.\nIn fact, the more I consider the scope of what Apple is working on, the more clear it seems that shipping early this year would have been extremely risky.\nTop comment by Luke Authier\nWhile I am eagerly awaiting a new, better Siri, I think we need to take a step back and realize the biggest problem with these AI's is hallucinations. While ChatGPT is relatively popular, I doubt it has close to the user base of iPhones, or Apple products in general. Imagine a billion Apple devices asking for medical advice and it gets something wrong. While Apple could use the whole, \"AI gets it wrong sometimes,\" I think we have all come to expect better of Apple. If they release it and it is giving hallucinations about serious things, they will be opening themselves up to lawsuits galore.\nThere\u2019s tremendous upside if Apple gets this right, but delivering a lackluster system would have been tough to recover from.\nSiri\u2019s new capabilities, grounded in the brand new LLM-based architecture, sound like the kind of changes we\u2019ve all been waiting for.\nAnd though that wait has been longer than expected, if Apple can deliver what it\u2019s promised, we should be in for quite the upgrade.\nHow are you feeling about Apple\u2019s forthcoming Siri upgrades?

      "text": "Apple Vision Pro will be two years old in February. For those holding out for a second-gen version, it sounds like the Apple Vision Pro 2 may have a better chip than expected.\nThe rumors have gone back and forth over which chip the refreshed Apple Vision Pro will use. The current hardware runs on an M2 chip, the newest chip when Apple announced Vision Pro, although the M3 arrived in products before Apple Vision Pro was released.\nEarly reports said the next Apple Vision Pro will run on the yet-to-be-announced M5. More recent reports have settled on the M4 chip. Having a chip that\u2019s one version below the latest when AVP 2 arrives would certainly match what AVP 1 does.\nIn a series of posts, however, MacRumors cites some sort of Apple code leak, probably only detectable by those who know where to look, in claiming Apple Vision Pro 2 will include the M5 chip. Other claims based on the code include Apple Watch Series 11 having no speed boost, and the next iPad mini running on an A19 Pro. The current iPad mini features the A17 Pro with support for Apple Intelligence.\nContext for the code leak, according to the site, includes \u201cApple accidentally leaked some internal information about the upcoming chip,\u201d \u201caccording to code accidentally shared by Apple,\u201d and \u201caccording to information found in code that Apple mistakenly shared.\u201d\nIt\u2019s difficult to parse these reports without more context about the apparent Apple code leak. Does the code provide a comprehensive look ahead? Pretty interesting if so. For now, we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens when Apple announces updates to the current Apple Vision Pro and iPad mini.\nCheck out these great accessories\nApple AirTag | Add Find My tracking to anything\nBeats USB-A to USB-C Cable | The official CarPlay cable\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "A new report from Bloomberg dives deep into Apple\u2019s plans to lean on artificial intelligence as a way to expand into robotics, home security, and smart displays.\nOne interesting tidbit in the report is that Apple is aiming to develop a system of smart home cameras and other home security products to compete with the likes of Amazon\u2019s Ring brand.\nBloomberg first reported that Apple was developing a home doorbell with support for Face ID last December. As it turns out, the company\u2019s ambitions extend well beyond that. Today\u2019s story details that Apple is developing a camera designed for home security that is battery-powered and \u201ccould last from several months to a year on a single charge.\u201d\nSome highlights of the device:\nThe device has facial recognition and infrared sensors to determine who is in a room. Apple believes users will place cameras throughout their home to help with automation. That could mean turning lights off when someone leaves a room or automatically playing music liked by a particular family member.\nThe report continues by saying Apple plans to \u201cdevelop multiple types of cameras and home-security products as part of an entirely new hardware and software lineup,\u201d to compete directly with Amazon\u2019s Ring and Google\u2019s Nest ecosystems.\nThere aren\u2019t any details on when these products might see the light of day.\nApple is also pressing ahead with its work on a table-top robot device, described as an \u201ciPad mounted on a movable limb that can swivel and reposition itself to follow users in a room.\u201d The company is targeting a 2027 launch for that device.

      "text": "If you have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 model, you can access Apple Intelligence when updating to iOS 18.1. This includes a new look for Siri, with a beautiful edge-lit animation.\nHowever, the new animation does not mean that Siri\u2019s intelligence or capabilities have meaningfully improved. Here\u2019s exactly what\u2019s new .. and what you have to keep waiting for.\nUpdates to Siri are part of the Apple Intelligence rollout. Apple Intelligence is available on supported iPhone, iPad and Mac computers running the latest operating system version. In the current iOS 18.1 release, your device language must be set to US English to access these features. Support for more English locales is coming in iOS 18.2, and more international languages will be supported in 2025.\nIf you don\u2019t have Apple Intelligence activated on a supported device, Siri will retain its old orb-like appearance. If you have Apple Intelligence, you get an eye-catching new design including an edge-lit animation which adapts in response to the sound of your voice.\nWhat\u2019s new in Siri right now\nThe new design is the main upgrade available to customers right now, but there are a few behavioural changes too. Firstly, along with the new appearance, you can now double-tap on the home indicator to launch Siri interface with a presented keyboard, so you can smoothly Type to Siri \u2013 for when you are in situations where it is more convenient to type, rather than speak. Apple Intelligence also has an improved voice synthesis engine to make it sound more natural.\nSecondly, Siri is more capable at understanding garbled or mis-spoken queries. For instance, if you accidentally stumble over your words mid-sentence, Siri is less likely to get confused, and more likely to understand your actual intent. If you say something like \u2018What\u2019s the weather in Spain, no I mean France?\u2019 you should get results for weather in France, rather than Spain.\nThirdly, Siri is more knowledgeable about the user manuals for Apple\u2019s products. That means you can ask Siri with Apple Intelligence questions about how to achieve things on your device, and it will be able to present a list of steps based on Apple\u2019s official documentation.\nBut the important takeaway is do not see the new shiny Siri and expect to be able to ask all sorts of questions to Apple\u2019s voice assistant that you couldn\u2019t before. Aside from how-to tutorials about Apple\u2019s products, Siri is really no smarter \u2014 yet.\nWhen to expect Siri to improve\nThe first improvements to Siri will come with the release of iOS 18.2, expected in December. With that update, you will be to enable ChatGPT integration at a system level. Siri will then be able to fallback to asking ChatGPT when it otherwise doesn\u2019t know the answer to your request. That means a lot more types of trivia and world knowledge queries will be successfully routed to ChatGPT, rather than an unhelpful list of Google search results. You don\u2019t need a paid account to use the ChatGPT integration in iOS 18.2, but you do need to explicitly opt-in.\nThe next big jump in Siri\u2019s abilities is scheduled to officially arrive sometime \u201cin the coming months\u201d, or unofficially as part of iOS 18.4 in the spring, according to the latest rumors.\nThat update will include Siri being able to draw on personal context using data on your device to answer new types of questions. That should mean Siri will be able to look at data sources like your message conversations, emails and calendar events to naturally answer questions like \u201cWhen is my flight\u201d or \u201cWhat was that book that Jane recommended?\u201d.\niOS 18.4 will also include Siri integrations with a whole bunch of new in-app actions, and onscreen awareness capabilities. That means Siri will functionally be able to do more, like if you are looking at an image in Photos and say \u201cmake it pop\u201d, Siri will automatically be able to trigger photo editing actions.\nSimilarly, Apple promises that if you are looking at a conversation in Messages about a group activity with dinner plans, you\u2019ll be able to say \u201ccall the restaurant\u201d and Siri will extract the phone number from the chat and initiate the phone call on your behalf.\nConclusion\nSiri looks better, and sounds better today. But you have to be patient until the more meaningful new features roll out. You also shouldn\u2019t expect iOS 18.4 to be a panacea either; the updates are concentrated on personal context related questions and many things you ask Siri to today where it fails, like asking to control multiple HomeKit accessories in a single request, will probably still fail.\nApple\u2019s consumer marketing has certainly not helped set the right expectations for the public, with one of the first Apple Intelligence ads demonstrating Siri features that aren\u2019t arriving until sometime next year.\nThere is also a very strong argument that they should have withheld the (very noticeable) new design until some of the significant new functionality was also shipping. In particular, Type to Siri almost invites the user to interact with it like a chatbot, with the presentation of the empty text field. But Siri is simply not capable of responding in that manner.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.\nComments"

      "text": "Apple\u2019s recent pattern with new MacBook Pro models has been to launch them in the fall. But recently Bloomberg indicated that may not happen this year, and now a second source has chimed in to support a later launch date.\nMing-Chi Kuo says M5 MacBook Pro is a 2026 product\nToday in a research note largely about the iPhone 18\u2019s A20 chip and its supplier, Ming-Chi Kuo also referenced Apple\u2019s M5 MacBook Pro.\nMore precisely, Kuo mentions \u201chigh-end M5 processors in the 2026 MacBooks.\u201d\nThis must refer to the M5 MacBook Pro because it is the only MacBook that receives \u201chigh-end\u201d versions of Apple\u2019s processors.\nApple is expected to launch its M5 MacBook Air in early 2026, but the MacBook Air typically only comes with the standard M-class chip.\nMacBook Pro, meanwhile, always offers higher-end Pro and Max chip variants.\nThus, Kuo appears to be saying that the M5 MacBook Pro won\u2019t arrive until 2026.\nThis isn\u2019t a huge surprise based on what Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman has been reporting. But it does make it less likely than ever that we\u2019ll see a new MacBook Pro before the year ends.\nDoes this mean Apple has run into issues with its higher-end M5 chips? It\u2019s possible.\nThe base M5 is still expected to debut this fall in the new iPad Pro, so there don\u2019t appear to be delays to the M5 line altogether, only select variants.\nHowever, Apple could instead be holding off so it can launch the M5 MacBook Pro alongside a rumored new external display.\nIn any case, if you\u2019re waiting to upgrade your MacBook Pro, it sounds like the wait may be a little longer than expected.\nBest Mac accessories\n- 100W USB-C power adapter for fast charging\n- tomtoc protective MacBook sleeve bag\n- AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)\n- Twelve South aluminum laptop stand for MacBooks\n- Anker Docking Station USB-C with Ethernet, HDMI, SD, more\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

It says:\nYour HomePod won\u2019t be able to show you the local weather, time, or respond to Siri requests about your area.\nThe word \u201cshow\u201d is the important part.\nWhy? Because currently no HomePod product has a screen that can show anything.\nBut Apple\u2019s new, and reportedly delayed HomePad will when it launches\u2014currently expected in spring 2026.\nExcept according to this leak, the \u2018HomePad\u2019 name isn\u2019t happening after all.\nInstead, it seems the new product will use the current \u2018HomePod\u2019 branding.\nMy guess? Apple plans to call it \u2018HomePod Touch.\u2019\nUsing \u2018HomePod Touch\u2019 would continue the trend of paying homage to the iPod with its music-focused HomePod line.\nAnd for a device that\u2019s expected to be, basically, a HomePod with a screen, \u2018HomePod Touch\u2019 makes a lot of sense.\nWhat do you think of the potential HomePod Touch branding?

      "text": "A hardware refresh for the Apple TV 4K set-top box is coming soon. The current generation was released in spring 2022, and is powered by an A15 Bionic chip.\nThe new generation is expected to feature a new Apple-designed WiFi and Bluetooth chip, as well as a CPU upgrade. A report from MacRumors today cites code references that indicate the box will actually get an A17 Pro chip, the same processor that powers the iPhone 15 Pro.\nThe jump from A15 to A17 obviously will provide a nice boost to CPU and GPU performance, approximately 15-30% increases as tested by synthetic benchmarks.\nHowever, the bigger breakpoint is the A17 Pro chip was the first A-series chip to support Apple Intelligence and all of the associated large language model features that brings.\nAs Apple Intelligence is a combination of on-device and server infrastructure, it requires compatible devices to have relatively powerful computational power, as well as ample RAM. As such, the current Apple TV is not powerful enough to run Apple Intelligence features, but a new Apple TV powered by A17 Pro could be.\nHowever, even if the chip is technically capable, it\u2019s currently unclear what Apple\u2019s plans are for Apple Intelligence in the living room. Most of the current suite of Apple Intelligence features do not really translate to a set-top box environment.\nFor instance, flagship Apple Intelligence features like writing tools, notification summaries, and visual intelligence do not make sense for Apple TV.\nPerhaps Apple could upgrade tvOS with TV-specific AI features, like the ability to jump to a particular scene in a TV show just by describing it with natural language. You can also imagine how a significantly upgraded Siri could make the Apple TV experience much better. But Apple is currently in the process of overhauling Siri with new foundations, a project that won\u2019t ship until the spring of 2026 at the earliest.\nAs such, I don\u2019t really think the next Apple TV will be marketed based on Apple Intelligence features. The A17 Pro chip will give the Apple TV better performance for games, and future-proof it so that it might be able to take advantage of new Siri capabilities down the road.\nAssuming the new Apple TV launches in 2025, it will probably be presented as a relatively low-key spec-bump refresh. Maybe the remote will finally add a speaker so you can use Find My to make it beep when you inevitably lose it down the back of the couch.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Apple has a big future planned for Siri, as outlined by a new Bloomberg report that mentions the assistant could be in store for a complete visual overhaul, gaining an animated personality that looks like the Mac\u2019s iconic Finder icon.\nFinder-inspired Siri design being considered for launch next year with AI upgrades\nIn a wide-ranging new report on Apple\u2019s Home device plans, Mark Gurman mentions that two upcoming devices\u2014the rumored 2026 \u2018HomePad/HomePod Touch\u2019 and a 2027 \u2018tabletop robot\u2019\u2014could pack a visually overhauled Siri.\nMark Gurman writes at Bloomberg:\nApple is planning to put Siri at the center of the device operating system and give it a visual personality to make it feel lifelike. The approach, dubbed Bubbles, is vaguely reminiscent of Clippy, an animated paper clip from the 1990s that served as a virtual assistant in Microsoft Office.\nApple has tested making Siri look like an animated version of the Finder logo, the iconic smiley face representing the Mac\u2019s file management system. A final decision on its appearance hasn\u2019t been made, with designers considering ideas that veer closer to Memoji, the playful characters that represent Apple user accounts.\nGurman says this new \u201cvisual personality\u201d for Siri will be a key part of Apple\u2019s forthcoming tabletop robot.\nThat product, he writes, \u201cresembles an iPad mounted on a movable limb that can swivel and reposition itself to follow users in a room.\u201d\nSiri will act as a sort of virtual companion on the device.\nThe idea is for the device to act like a person in a room. It could interrupt a conversation between friends about dinner plans, say, and suggest nearby restaurants or relevant recipes. It\u2019s also being designed to engage in back-and-forth discussions for things like planning a trip or getting tasks done \u2014 similar to OpenAI\u2019s voice mode.\nThough this new Siri look and personality sounds central to the 2027 Home product, it could arrive even sooner.\nGurman\u2019s report notes that the fresh visual design for Siri might arrive as early as next year.\nThat\u2019s because the rumored HomePad/HomePod Touch device \u201cmay also include the new Siri visual interface.\u201d It won\u2019t have the same level of conversational powers as the later device, though.\nSiri rebranding: take two\nMany have wondered if Apple might want to rebrand Siri when its long-awaited AI upgrades finally do arrive.\nWhether the name Siri sticks or not, it sounds like a visual overhaul is very much in the cards.\nHere\u2019s hoping the assistant\u2019s new capabilities can truly deliver, and justify Apple\u2019s second recent attempt at a fresh design. iOS 18.1\u2019s new Siri unfortunately did not.\nWhat do you think of having Siri look like the Finder icon?

      "text": "Rumors have long indicated Apple intends to bring cellular connectivity to the Mac, but a new report indicates the first cellular Mac might be right around the corner: the M5 MacBook Pro.\nM5 MacBook Pro with 5G cellular reportedly being tested\nEarlier today, Filipe Esposito reported at Macworld that he\u2019d uncovered code evidence of an M4 Ultra chip in a forthcoming Mac Pro model.\nNow, Esposito has a follow-up report on another Mac model: the M5 MacBook Pro.\nInternal Apple code seen by Macworld now reveals that the company has indeed been testing an unreleased MacBook Pro model with an M5 Pro chip and Apple\u2019s first 5G modem. [\u2026]\nThis Mac laptop found in the code is powered by the M5 Pro chip (codenamed t6050), which indicates the upcoming generation of MacBook Pro.\nBut the M5 Pro isn\u2019t the most exciting thing about this discovery. The same code suggests that this could be the first Mac ever to include a \u201cCentuari\u201d chip, which is the codename for Apple\u2019s 5G modem (also known as C1), introduced earlier this year with the iPhone 16e.\nMark Gurman at Bloomberg has previously reported that Apple was likely to bring cellular to the Mac, but he indicated it might not happen until a next-generation C2 modem launches.\nThough evidence of Apple testing the C1 with an M5 MacBook Pro doesn\u2019t confirm it will ship, it\u2019s exciting news nonetheless.\nUntil recently, the M5 MacBook Pro was expected to launch this fall, but now it\u2019s reportedly coming in early 2026 instead.\nIf cellular truly does come to the MacBook Pro in early 2026, it could very well be included on the M5 MacBook Air too. Though Apple might always choose to keep it a Pro-exclusive feature for the time being.\nWould you buy an M5 MacBook Pro with cellular?
