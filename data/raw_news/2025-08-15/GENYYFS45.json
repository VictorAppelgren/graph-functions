  "title": "Trump-Putin Meeting: No Peace Deal On Ukraine As Trump Says Leaders Made Headway",
  "description": "The two are expected to hold a joint press conference following the meeting.",
  "content": "\u201cThere\u2019s no deal until there\u2019s a deal,\u201d Trump said in his opening remarks, noting he and Putin made \u201cheadway\u201d and \u201cgreat progress\u201d in discussions about Ukraine. The U.S. president said he would call NATO leaders to inform them about his meeting with Putin, though Trump did not provide any specifics on what he and the Russian president gained progress on. Trump and Putin did not take questions from the press following their statements. Putin said Russian concerns in Ukraine need to be addressed before peace can be achieved. Trump and Putin began their joint press conference at 6:54 p.m. EDT, with Putin providing opening remarks and calling the U.S. and Russia neighbors before saying an in-person meeting was \u201clong overdue.\u201d Trump and Putin shook hands on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage around 3:10 p.m. EDT after both exited their planes, before getting into Trump\u2019s limousine en route to the meeting location. Trump landed in Anchorage moments before Putin on Friday ahead of the meeting, which included Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One there was \u201cnothing set in stone\u201d regarding his expectations from the meeting, but said Russia and the U.S. \u201care not doing business until we get the war settled,\u201d adding that he wants \u201cto see a cease-fire rapidly\u201d but is uncertain about the timing: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be happy if it\u2019s not today,\u201d he said. Trump wrote \u201cHIGH STAKES!!!\u201d on Truth Social shortly before taking off for Alaska. In a subsequent Truth Social post a short time later, Trump said he spoke to Putin ally, Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko, Friday morning to thank him for releasing 16 political prisoners in July and that the meeting with Putin was also discussed. The White House tempered expectations of Friday\u2019s sit-down, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt referring to it as a \u201clistening exercise\u201d at Putin\u2019s request, describing \u201cthe goal of this meeting for the president . . . to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.\u201d Trump told Fox News Thursday he was optimistic Putin is \u201cgoing to make a deal\u201d and that he will \u201cknow very quickly\u201d whether the Russian leader wants to cooperate, though Trump also acknowledged this week he doesn\u2019t believe he can convince Putin to fully stop the violence, telling reporters, \u201cI guess the answer to that is no, because I\u2019ve had this conversation\u201d when asked if he believes he can convince Putin to stop bombing civilians. Putin, meanwhile, said Thursday the U.S. was \u201cmaking, in my opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\u201d\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday on X, \u201cthere is no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war,\u201d but he believes coordination between the U.S. and Ukraine\u2019s partners in Europe \u201ccan definitely compel Russia to make peace.\u201d Zelenskyy also told reporters this week Ukrainian officials \u201chope that the central topic of the meeting will be a ceasefire. An immediate ceasefire,\u201d following a call between Trump and European leaders in which Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin was discussed. Zelenskyy has also rejected Trump\u2019s proposal for a potential swapping of Ukrainian territories. Trump told reporters Friday aboard Air Force one territorial swaps would \u201cbe discussed, but I\u2019ve got to let Ukraine make that decision.\u201d\n\nTrump and Putin last met in 2019 at the G20 summit in Japan, their sixth meeting during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nRussia will face \u201ceconomically severe\u201d consequences if Putin doesn\u2019t make progress toward a ceasefire. Trump also said Wednesday following the call with European leaders he hopes to broker \u201ca quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy\u201d following Friday\u2019s sit-down.\n\nTrump has become increasingly critical of Putin as the Russian leader has resisted Trump\u2019s attempts to broker an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump, who in 2019 after their sit down in Japan, said he and Putin had a \u201cvery, very good relationship,\u201d called Putin\u2019s niceties \u201cbulls\u2013t\u201d in July. Trump\u2019s desire to negotiate a ceasefire is widely believed to be tied to his public bid for a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nKremlin Says Trump And Putin Will Meet One-On-One Before Delegation Talks (Forbes)\n\nTrump Says He Made No Progress On Ukraine-Russia War In Call With Putin (Forbes)\n\nTrump Says Ukraine And Russia Will Negotiate Ceasefire Directly After Putin Call (Forbes)",

Trump also said last week he wanted to meet Putin in person \u201cas soon as we can set it up\u201d\nWhat To Watch For\nTrump suggested the Vatican as a potential host for negotiations, saying it \u201chas stated that it would be very interested\u201d in doing so.\nTangent\nVice President JD Vance told reporters Monday \u201cwe\u2019re more than open to walking away\u201d from the negotiations.

Zelenskyy sat out the talks when Putin declined to attend. Trump claimed Putin didn\u2019t go because he skipped the meeting. Zelenskyy met with Vice President JD Vance on Saturday at the Vatican, where Zelenskyy said he reiterated the need for a ceasefire, sanctions against Russia and continued coordination between Russia and the U.S. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio pushed for a ceasefire in a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.\nFurther Reading\nTrump Says He Wants To Meet Putin \u2018Soon\u2019 After Both Skip Ukraine Peace Talks In Turkey (Forbes)\nTrump Says He Will Speak To Putin Monday\u2014After Russian President Skipped Peace Talks (Forbes)"

That is how much money in military assistance the U.S. provided Ukraine from Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion to March 2025, according to the State Department.\nWhat To Watch For\nRussia appears unlikely to end its invasion of Ukraine unless Ukraine surrenders or the U.S. is able to establish a peace deal between the two countries that gives significant concessions to Russia. Vice President JD Vance told reporters the Russia-Ukraine war was \u201cnot going to end anytime soon\u201d after the U.S. and Ukraine signed a minerals deal designed to provide compensation for the financial support the U.S. has provided.\nKey Background\nTrump and Zelenskyy\u2019s relationship soured earlier this year after the two traded critical remarks in February, bringing relations between the U.S. and Ukraine to their lowest point in years. Trump falsely claimed Ukraine started the war with Russia and received backlash from Zelenskyy, who said the president was living in a Russian-made \u201cdisinformation space.\u201d Trump then accused Zelenskyy of being a dictator and being uninterested in putting an end to the war. Trump and Zelenskyy had an Oval Office meeting alongside Vance and members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet a little over a week later, with the two ending peace talks early following the combative discussion. Zelenskyy scrutinized Trump\u2019s increasing communication with Putin, saying the Russian president has been an unreliable diplomat after citing failed deals with Putin. Trump said Zelenskyy disrespected the U.S. in the meeting and suggested the U.S. could fully withdraw support from Ukraine\u2019s defense efforts."

      "text": "Is there a direct link between what US President Donald Trump says and what Russian President Vladimir Putin does?\nCertainly, the harsh words and bitter violence of recent days in Ukraine suggest the answer is maybe.\nFirst, President Trump vented his frustrations at the lack of commitment from his Russian counterpart to engage in a serious peace process.\n\u201cWe get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump blustered in a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s very nice all of the time, but it turns out to be meaningless,\u201d he complained.\nThe very next day, as if infuriated by the remarks, Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine, sending 728 drones and 13 missiles to strike cities around the country in multiple waves.\nIt was a \u201ctelling attack,\u201d observed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who condemned the strikes as timed to rebuff peace efforts.\nThere are apparent signs of a pattern.\nLast week, after Trump publicly bemoaned that he had made \u201cno progress\u201d towards a ceasefire after a lengthy telephone call with the Kremlin leader, Russia unleashed yet another massive barrage on Ukraine. It rained down 539 drones and 11 missiles in what Ukrainian officials described as one of the worst attacks of the conflict.\nYou might be forgiven for thinking that every time President Trump expresses anger, frustration or even negativity about his Kremlin counterpart, the immediate response from Russia is to step up the ruthless punishment it metes out to its Ukrainian neighbor.\nBut it\u2019s not as straightforward as that.\nThe problem is, Russia also carries out devastating strikes on Ukraine during periods when the US president is relatively silent about the conflict he notoriously vowed to end in a single day.\nOn June 29, for example, Moscow launched 477 drones and 60 missiles against Ukraine \u2013 at the time, the biggest Russian aerial assault of the war. Yet President Trump had made few significant public comments about Russia in the days before.\nFurthermore, when President Trump told fellow G7 leaders of industrialized democracies that he essentially regretted the absence of Putin at the June summit, and criticized previous leaders for kicking Russia out of what was then the G8, Moscow went on to ratchet up attacks on Kyiv, killing at least 28 people in a single night of drone and missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital days later.\nEven positive remarks from the US president, which you might reasonably expect to temper any simmering Russian anger at how it is spoken about in the White House, do not appear to act as a brake on the Kremlin\u2019s excesses.\nFor its part, the Kremlin has played down any suggestion that President Trump\u2019s recent critical outburst has had much impact.\n\u201cWe are taking it quite calmly,\u201d the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on a daily conference call, adding that \u201cTrump, in general, tends to use a fairly tough style and expressions.\u201d\nIn reality, Russian military tactics are much more likely to be driven by its own unrelenting military objective of seizing as much territory as possible before the grinding conflict in Ukraine, now in its fourth year, ultimately comes to a halt.\nLikewise, the terrifying increase in the use of Russian drones in recent weeks is more likely to be a reflection of missile shortages and increased drone production in Russia than any angry Putin retort to one of President Trump\u2019s off-hand comments."

In recent months, Dmitriev has spoken positively about the Trump administration and praised the \u201cpositive dynamic\u201d in discussions between the two countries. Earlier this year, Dmitriev shared a Truth Social post by Trump on X, where the president said \u201cmajor Economic Development transactions\u201d will take place between Russia and the U.S. after he negotiates an end to the Ukraine war. The sovereign wealth fund chief wrote: \u201cRussia is open for US Russia economic cooperation and believes such cooperations is key for more resilient global economy.\u201d Since then, he has pushed for U.S. and Russian collaboration in the Arctic and other matters, including space flights to Mars and rare earth metals.\nSurprising Fact\nA VIP jet of the Russia\u2019s Special Flight Squadron left Moscow for Anchorage early on Thursday, according to live tracking data from FlightRadar24. The plane in question is an Ilyushin Il-96-300, the same type operated by the Special Flight Squadron as the country\u2019s presidential jet. It is unclear if Putin is onboard the flight in question. The plane is scheduled to land in Anchorage at 6:43 a.m. local time. As of early Thursday morning, the Russian jet is the most tracked plane on FlightRadar24, with more than 15,000 following it live.\nFurther Reading\nTrump and Putin will meet at an Alaska military base long used to counter Russia (Associated Press)\nWhat\u2019s at Stake at the Trump-Putin Summit in Alaska (New York Times)"

Trump said the talks made \"headway\" but admitted no concrete progress was achieved, while Putin emphasized that Russian concerns must be addressed before peace can be reached. Trump threatened severe sanctions if Russia does not move toward peace and hinted at trade talks, whereas Zelenskyy remained skeptical, noting no sign Russia is willing to end the conflict. The meeting was framed by the White House as a \"listening exercise\" aimed at better understanding how to end the war, with both leaders hinting at future negotiations and potential territorial swaps that Zelenskyy has opposed.",
