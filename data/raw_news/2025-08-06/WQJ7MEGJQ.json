  "description": "But as usual, we don\u2019t know why.",
  "content": "Apple is juggling a large number of betas this month as it prepares to launch iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, and the rest of its 2026 updates, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s stopped working on the smaller updates to existing products. Last week, for example, we got iOS 18.6, and this week there\u2019s a new firmware update to the 25W MagSafe charger.\n\nBefore you ask, we don\u2019t know what it does. Apple doesn\u2019t provide release notes for firmware updates like these, but it\u2019s likely related to performance and stability. The new version 2A168 firmware replaces the 2A146 firmware that arrived earlier this year. In the Settings app, the new firmware is version 148, up from 136. It\u2019s not clear whether the version numbers are significant in any way.\n\nOnce again, the latest firmware is specifically for the 25W version of the MagSafe Charger, which arrived last year alongside the iPhone 16. Apple has issued several firmware updates since then, but none of them have included the older 15W cable.\n\nTo check which cable you have, plug in the charger, attach it to your iPhone, and head over to the Settings app. Then tap General > About and tap Apple MagSafe Charger. If the firmware version is 128 or higher, you have the 25W model.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to directly install the update on your charger. Instead, you\u2019ll need to plug it in, attach it to your iPhone, and wait. The update should arrive within 30 minutes.",

      "text": "Apple has now released iOS 18.6, which should be the last update before iOS 26 lands in September. It fixes a small bug in Photos that could prevent memory movies from being generated, and also includes two dozen security updates.\nThere are some changes specifically for the EU, related to Apple\u2019s new policies and interface for installing third-party app stores or app directly from the web. For everyone else, expect just security updates and a minor bug or two fixed.\niOS 18.6: Release notes\nThe release notes for iOS 18.6 are short and simple:\nThis update provides important bug fixes and security updates, and fixes an issue in Photos that could prevent memory movies from being shared.\niOS 18.6: Security updates\nApple\u2019s security content page is far more extensive than its release. There are 24 specific security fixes listed, including several for Apple\u2019s Safari WebKit engine that could lead to crashes and denial of service. Additionally, there is a patch for Mail Drafts that could load remote content even when the \u201cLoad Remote Images\u201d setting is turned off. If for no other reason, go get iOS 18.6 for these fixes alone.\niOS 18.6: EU App Store changes\nApple is rolling out new App Store guidelines and a new user experience for those in the EU, in an attempt to comply with the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act. Critics say Apple\u2019s new terms are intentionally confusing, do not comply with EU law, and punish developers even more than before should they choose to avoid the App Store and distribute their apps themselves.\niOS 18.6 includes a new user experience when customers attempt to install an alternative app marketplace or install apps directly from the web. This only applies to customers in the EU.\niOS 18.6: How to install\nTo install the iOS 18.6 beta on your iPhone, head over to the Settings app, then General and Software Update, and follow the prompts. If you\u2019re already running the iOS 26 beta and want to revert, you can erase your iPhone, turn off beta updates, and install the iOS 18.6 beta."

      "text": "Apple revealed its plans for the next version of macOS at the WWDC keynote on Monday June 9, 2025. The company also showed off new features for the next iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and more at the event.\nLike its counterparts on the other Apple devices, macOS is getting a brand new look for 2025-2026 along with a new name. Because Apple is aligning the names of all the operating systems this year, the new version of macOS be called macOS 26 rather than macOS 16. It will also take the name Tahoe, inspired by the lake, beaches and the ski resorts of that area of California.\nAlong with the redesign, macOS 26 gains new Continuity featuers, a brand new Phone app and new Live Activities. Spotlight also gets its biggest ever update with the ability to action things like sending emails and more from within Spotlight.\nThese new features will be available later this year, but if you would like to try them out now you can. The developer beta is out now and the public beta will follow in July. We have more information about joining the beta and the release date of the public beta below.\nYou will find all the things you need to know about macOS Tahoe below, including which Macs are compatible with macOS 26 and the new features you can expect. So, stay tuned to this superguide for everything you need to know about macOS 26 Tahoe, the latest version of the beta and all the new features that are coming.\nmacOS 26 Tahoe release date\n- Date TBD: 15 September, 2025 predicted\nApple\u2019s official release of macOS 26 Tahoe will be in the fall, as is usually the case. We don\u2019t know the release date for sure, but we can estimate that it will coincide with the release of the new iOS update, which will probably happen a few days after the iPhone event in September 2025. We anticipate the September iPhone event and the launch of the launch of the iPhone 17 will take place on September 9, so the software could be out around September 15 or 16.\nHowever, Apple has previously scheduled the update to macOS after iOS, sometimes as short as a week, sometimes as long as a month, so there could be a longer wait with an October release possible.\nHere is the recent shipping history for macOS.\n- macOS 15 Sequoia: September 16, 2024\n- macOS 14 Sonoma: September 26, 2023\n- macOS 13 Ventura: October 24, 2022\n- macOS 12 Monterey: October 25, 2021\n- macOS 11 Big Sur: November 12, 2020\n- macOS 10.15 Catalina: October 7, 2019\n- macOS 10.14 Mojave: September 24, 2018\nYouTube / Apple\nmacOS 26 Tahoe Beta release date\n- Developer beta: June 9\n- Public beta: July 24\nHowever, you won\u2019t have to wait until the full release to try the new software out. Apple runs a developer beta as well as a public beta, so if you want to try out the new features before they are released to the general public, you will be able to do so. Both betas are free, though the developer beta requires a free registration as a developer.\nThe developer beta is released first following the WWDC keynote, so developers can immediately begin testing it with their products. Apple then releases a public beta for everyone else who wants to try it. The Public Beta usually arrives in July, about a month after the first developer beta. Then, whenever Apple issues beta updates, the updated public beta follows a day or two after the updated developer beta.\nIf you are interested in using the beta, you can join Apple\u2019s beta program. The beta program involves running software that will have some stability issues, and you are expected to provide Apple with details of any issues through the Apple Feedback app. Just be aware that beta software is likely to be unstable and may even cause your Mac to become unusable.\nFor help installing the macOS beta see our guide to installing the macOS beta.\nmacOS 26 Tahoe supported devices: Which Macs get macOS Tahoe\n- Requires Apple Silicon or Intel-based Mac computers with a T2 Security Chip\n- Apple Intelligence features require M1 or later\nWhen Apple updates the operating system for its devices, it sometimes means that certain models are no longer supported. The good news is that Macs that ran macOS Sonoma will be able to run the new macOS. Apple states that the requirement is: Macs with Apple silicon and Intel-based Mac computers with a T2 Security Chip.\nHere are Macs with Apple Silicon that will be able to run macOS Tahoe:\n- MacBook Air (M1/2020 and later)\n- MacBook Pro (M1/2020 and later)\n- iMac (M1/2021 and later)\n- Mac mini (M1/2020 and later)\n- Mac Studio (M1/2022 and later)\n- Mac Pro (M2/2023 and later)\nHere are the four Intel-powered Macs able to run macOS Tahoe. These models won\u2019t support Apple Intelligence features:\n- MacBook Pro (16\u2011inch, Intel/2019)\n- MacBook Pro (13\u2011inch, Intel/2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n- iMac (Intel/mid 2020)\n- Mac Pro (Intel/2019)\nApple has confirmed that this is the last version of macOS for Intel Macs.\nmacOS 26 Tahoe design: Liquid Glass and other interface changes\nApple\nApple showed off some enticing new features for macOS that will be coming later in 2025. A number of new features and interface enhancements were promised, but one of the biggest changes is coming to all of Apple\u2019s products: a new design based on a graphical user interface that Apple is calling Liquid Glass.\nApple showed off the brand new look for macOS in the WWDC keynote. As with Apple\u2019s other operating systems, macOS Tahoe uses Apple\u2019s new Liquid Glass effect to create reflective, glossy elements around the interface. The Liquid Glass elements will change color to reflect the content beneath as you scroll and will dynamically react. Buttons appear more curved and less flat.\nYou\u2019ll see the effect in the Dock, sidebars, toolbars and elsewhere. The menu bar is fully transparent, and you can adjust the transparency of icons in the Dock, for example.\nThis is the first time in years that Apple has made significant changes to the visual style of macOS, and it certainly makes the OS appear more modern.\nInterface changes\nApple\nApple says the design overhaul will elevate the key elements of macOS and enhance the macOS experience. The cleaner design is intended to help the user to focus on their content rather than other distractions, while elements like the translucent menu bar will make the screen feel larger.\nUsers will be able to choose to add third-party apps to the menu bar and even drag widgets and buttons from the Control Centre into the menu bar, thanks to a customizable layout, similar to iOS 18. Users will also be able to add controls for their favorite apps to the Control Centre. We have a guide to how to use Control Centre in macOS Tahoe where you can read about how to add controls, remove the ones you don\u2019t want, and arrange them in a way that makes sense for you.\nmacOS will also gain a feature that arrived on the iPhone and iPad with iOS 18: tinted and dark app icons.\nUsers will be able to personalize their Mac in other ways, too, such as changing the color of folders and adding emoji or symbols to help them identify folders. Users can also pick personalised wallpapers and choose theme colors.\nSpotlight overhaul\nApple\nSpotlight has always been much more than a search tool built into macOS, helping users find anything on their Macs, make calculations and conversions, and more. In macOS Tahoe, Spotlight will be able to do even more.\nSpotlight\u2019s design and functionality have been completely rethought for macOS 26, with changes that will help Mac users get things done faster.\nRather than being a single bar, on the right-hand side of the new Spotlight search box, you will find icons for things like apps, files, Shortcuts, Actions, and clipboard. Select one of these buttons, and Spotlight\u2019s box expands to house relevant items in an easy-to-browse view. When you search for something, you\u2019ll see relevant filters under your search terms \u2013 click one to quickly apply it.\nNot only will Spotlight be the easiest way to find anything on your Mac, but in macOS 26, Spotlight will be contextually aware so it can make suggestions based on what you are doing. Search results will be listed based on their relevance to you, and it will be possible to use new filtering options for more specific search results.\nSpotlight will also have the ability to perform actions that normally require you to be inside an app. For example, you will be able to create a calendar event, begin an audio recording, or play a podcast from within Spotlight. It will even let you fill out parameters for actions, such as typing out an email message and filling in the recipient and subject. You can essentially compose an email from inside Spotlight, without opening your email app.\nThis will be simplified further with Quick Keys, with which you will be able to type a short string of letters to launch an action, such as typing \u201csm\u201d to start sending a message to a friend. An App Intents API will make it possible for third-party developers to add Spotlight shortcuts for their applications.\nOne of the most exciting new arrivals in Spotlight is Clipboard History, something we have wanted for years. Instead of being limited to pasting the last copied item, you will be able to view previous text and photos you\u2019ve copied and re-insert them as needed. Why did it take Apple so long to offer this?\nApple\nTied to the new Spotlight is the new Apps app, which replaces Launchpad. Apps has a different interface that Launchpad, which will take some adjustment, especially if you were a Launchpad user. Learn more about Apps replacing Launchpad.\nmacOS 26 Tahoe: New and updated apps\nThere are also lots of updates coming to Apple apps that are included with iPads, iPhones, and Macs. Many of the changes are shared across all the new apps, but there are a number of Mac-specific updates coming.\nPhone app\nA Phone app on the Mac is the latest Continuity feature to come to macOS. Continuity is Apple\u2019s name for the features that work seamlessly between Macs, iPad and iPhones, these include Handoff (which enables you to start a task on one device and switch to another to finish it), Universal Clipboard (which allows you to copy something on one device and paste it on another), and Universal Control (where you can use one mouse and keyboard to interface with more than one Mac), among other features.\nWith the new Phone app, users will be able to receive their calls and voicemail on the Mac. The Phone app is getting some new features of its own, including Call Screening, which is designed to help you avoid spam calls, and Hold Assist, which means you will never have to listen to hold music again.\nWith Call Screening, before a call is put through, an unknown caller will have to share their name and reason for calling, and you will then be provided with that information. With Hold Assist, when you join a queue to wait for a call operator and the hold music starts, you can choose to be called back.\nYouTube / Apple\nLive Activities\nAnother feature that demonstrates the interoperability between the iPhone and Mac is Live Activities.\nIn iOS 18, you can see a live update on your Lock Screen relating to things like a takeaway order. Live Activities show the process of a food delivery driver, for example. Now, that functionality is coming to the Mac.\nIt will be powered by the iPhone Mirroring function, and will take the form of an iPhone-style widget that you will see on the screen of your Mac.\nGames app\nThe Games app is another one that is available across all three main operating system updates: iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. As with the iOS Games app, the Games app on the Mac will bring together all the games you have on your Mac (bought from the App Store, Apple Arcade and elsewhere), as well as your friends list, achievements, and leaderboards. Tabs will make it easy to find the games you and your friends are playing.\nA new Game Overlay will make it easy to adjust settings for a particular game. You\u2019ll also be able to chat with friends and ask them to play.\nThere is also a new Low Power Mode coming, which gamers will be able to turn on to maximise battery life when playing games.\nAnd in related news, Metal 4 is coming, which will enable next-gen features for Mac game developers, such as MetalFX Frame Interpolation and MetalFX De-noising.\nApple\nShortcuts\nApple\nThe Shortcuts app is getting an overhaul in macOS Tahoe.\nShortcuts is a tool for automating tasks and repetitive actions. For those with more specific needs, there is also Automator on the Mac, but Shortcuts is simple to use and available on iPhone and iPad as well.\nIn Tahoe, Shortcuts will be able to run workflows based on factors like time of day, or in response to an email from a specific person arriving. This functionality was previously limited to the iPhone and iPad versions.\nThere are new intelligent actions available that can be used to create Smart Shortcuts. Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT can be used to enhance these Shortcuts. Apple says that \u201cUsers will see dedicated actions for features like summarizing text with Writing Tools or creating images with Image Playground.\u201d\nLive Translation\nOne of the most useful new features announced at WWDC is Live Translation. With Live Translation, you can text a friend who speaks a different language and have the translations appear in real time, or get instant translations during a phone call or FaceTime conference. Everyone gets their own translator.\nYou\u2019ll be able to take advantage of Live Translation in the Phone app, Messages, and FaceTime on your Mac.\nApple\nJournal\nThe Journal app, which arrived on iOS in 2023, is coming to the Mac (and iPad).\nTerminal\nTerminal is getting a colorful redesign and the Liquid Glass treatment, with support for 24-bit color and the ability to use Powerline fonts.\nReminders\nReminders is getting some help from Apple Intelligence. Reminders will scan a website, note, email or other content, then decide the most relevant action items for you based on its findings. You\u2019ll be able to use Apple Intelligence to automatically categorize your reminders into sections, making them easier to find\nThere are also changes coming to Safari, Messages, Photos, FaceTime, and Notes."

      "text": "In summary\niPadOS 19 is dead, long live iPadOS 26! It\u2019s not just a new name, though, with iPadOS 26 adding a whole new suite of features. While there some borrowed from iOS, this is likely iPad\u2019s biggest update in years, including a visual overhaul, new window management options, and more Mac-like features like menu bars.\nIt\u2019s been six years since Apple rebranded the iPad branch of iOS to iPadOS, but it\u2019d be fair to say it\u2019s not entirely certain why that was decision was made.\nWhile some features tend to shuffle across from the iPhone a year later, iPadOS 26 (you didn\u2019t miss any years, Apple has changed its naming convention) is offering a bunch of features that make it well worth the download.\nWWDC finally confirmed iPad users will get a host of Mac-like features, which might make the purchasing decision between a laptop and a tablet just a tad trickier. iPadOS 26 will revamp the Files app, add background processes, and perhaps most importantly of all, finally give us proper window management tools.\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about the latest update, including when you\u2019re likely to be able to get your hands on it, and compatible devices.\niPadOS 26 release date: When is the new iPad software coming out?\n- Full version: September 15 (predicted)\nThe official release date has not been announced, but Apple currently has an annual cycle with its operating systems that happens in the September timeframe. Based on recent history, iPadOS 19 could be released to the public on September 15 or 22. There have been years when iPadOS has arrived later alongside macOS in October.\nHere are the release dates for the past version of iPadOS:\n- iPadOS 18: September 16, 2024\n- iPadOS 17: September 18, 2023\n- iPadOS 16: September 12, 2022\n- iPadOS 15: September 20, 2021\n- iPadOS 14: September 16, 2020\n- iPadOS 13: September 24, 2019\niPadOS 26 supported devices\n- The update is available for more recent devices\n- Even the first-generation 11-inch iPad Pro will run the latest software\nWhen Apple updates the operating system for its devices it sometimes means that certain models are no longer supported.\nHere\u2019s what Apple has confirmed will get support:\n- iPad Pro M4\n- iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd Gen or later)\n- iPad Pro 11-inch (1st Gen or later)\n- iPad Air (M2 or later)\n- iPad Air (3rd Gen or later)\n- iPad (A16)\n- iPad (8th Gen or later)\nApple Intelligence features require iPad mini (A17 Pro) or iPad models with M-series processors.\nWant more from WWDC? Be sure to check out video coverage on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. And subscribe to Macworld\u2019s daily and weekly newsletters for Apple coverage, from WWDC to beyond.\niPadOS developer and public betas\n- Developer beta: from June 9 (expected)\n- Public beta: from July 14 (estimated)\nApple makes betas of its operating systems available before the official release in September. A developer beta is released first following the WWDC keynote, so developers can immediately begin testing it with their products. The WWDC25 keynote will be held on June 9, so the developer beta should be available later that day after the keynote presentation.\nApple then releases a public beta for everyone else, which usually arrives in July, about a month after the first developer beta. Then, whenever Apple issues beta updates, the updated public beta follows a day or two after the updated developer beta.\nIf you are interested in using the beta, you can join Apple\u2019s beta program. The beta program involves running software that will have some stability issues, and you are expected to provide Apple with details of any issues through the Apple Feedback app.\nFor help installing iPadOS beta on your iPad see our guide to installing the iOS beta (the method is very similar).\niPadOS 26 New features\n- Huge redesign\n- Window management overhaul\n- Audio input changes\n- Background processes\niPadOS 26 is bringing plenty of new features, along with the first major visual overhaul of iOS/iPadOS since iOS 7.\nMajor design overhaul\nApple\u2019s codename \u2018Solarium\u2019 update is here, with the company dubbing the overhaul \u201cLiquid Glass\u201d. It\u2019s being applied to all of this year\u2019s OS updates, so anyone moving between them will see the more transparent, lighter designs. (See what Liquid Glass means for macOS Tahoe, iOS 26 and watchOS 26).\nApple\nBonafide windowing options\nAfter years of asking, iPadOS 26 will finally revamp window management to make it much closer to a more conventional Mac.\nTiling options, and the removal of the Stage Manager grid, make it much more flexible. In fact, Expose is here, too, bringing the iPad closer to macOS than ever before.\nNothing hammers that home more than iPad finally gaining a menu bar, albeit one that\u2019s central to the display as opposed to being in the top-left corner.\nThese features work across external displays, too, and Stage Manager is still available, too.\nFoundry\nAudio Input\nApple\nThere\u2019s a new audio input setting to allow podcasters to record from external mics, while Voice Isolation can keep your voice sounding crisp.\nAirPods will also be able to record \u201cstudio quality\u201d audio, according to Apple, while you can record local capture of video calls.\nBackground Functions\nYou\u2019ll be able to run processes in the background on your iPad, without needing to keep your Final Cut export or Google Drive upload sitting in the foreground. That\u2019s a huge boost for everyone.\niPadOS 26 new and updated apps\n- New Games app\n- Journal\n- Revamped Files app\nThere are a number of updates said to be coming to Apple\u2019s own apps, some of which may be enhanced by Apple Intelligence.\nNew Games app\nThe new Apple Games app that had leaked is very real indeed, helping players find the latest updates for the games they\u2019re playing regularly, as well as curated recommendations for new releases. There\u2019s also a series of competitive leaderboards for playing with friends, with Apple Arcade seemingly being rolled into it.\nApple\nMessages\niPadOS 26 will gain the features from iOS 26 for messages, allowing users to run polls in group chats and custom backgrounds.\nTranslation\niOS 26 will be able to translate messages instantly through Live Translation, and iPadOS 26 will get the same treatment, too. It\u2019ll also work in FaceTime, letting you translate throughout a call across language barriers.\nFiles\nFiles is getting an updated list view and folder customization options just like (you guessed it) macOS, as well as default apps for opening certain file types. You can even add folders to your dock, and Preview is finally on iPadOS with Apple Pencil markup and autofill.\nJournal\nYep, Journal is FINALLY on iPad, and it has Apple Pencil support. Yes, we thought it was already there, too."

      "text": "Apple\u2019s iOS 26 plans, in brief\n- The new iOS update is called iOS 26, not iOS 19\n- Redesign features translucent Liquid Glass effect\n- Phone to get Call Screening, Hold Assist, and Live Translations\nApple revealed its plans for its next iOS update at the WWDC keynote on June 9, 2025. iOS 26, coming to iPhones later this year, will bring a brand new look and lots of new features that will simplify and enhance the way we use existing apps.\nIn this article we cover everything you need to know about iOS 26, including when iOS 26 will launch, which iPhones it will be compatible with, and all the new features and apps that are coming with the iPhone update. We also have the latest information about the iOS beta, for those who are keen to get iOS 26 on their iPhones now.\nIt\u2019s iOS 26, not iOS 19\nThe upcoming iOS is known as iOS 26, rather than iOS 19. In 2025 Apple is breaking with tradition and switching to a simpler naming convention that relates to the year, rather than a sequential number: it is 26 because iOS 26 will not launch until late 2025, and will be the operating system until late in 2026. Apple is using 26 for all of the operating system updates across the board, including the next iPadOS update, macOS Tahoe, the new watchOS and more, all of which were announced at WWDC.\niOS 26 Release date: When is the new iOS coming out?\n- Date TBC: 15 September, 2025 predicted\niOS 26 isn\u2019t out yet, at least not for the general public. It will likely be available to install on compatible iPhones in September. This will likely happen shortly after the September event and the launch of the iPhone 17 and new Apple Watches.\niOS 26 Beta release date: What\u2019s the latest beta\n- Latest Developer Beta: Version 5, August 5, 2025\n- Latest Public Beta: July 24, 2025\nYou don\u2019t have to wait until the full release to try the new software out. Apple runs a developer beta and a public beta for those who want to try out the new features before they are released to the general public. Both betas are free, though the developer beta requires a free registration as a developer.\nThe first version of the iOS developer beta was released following the WWDC keynote, so developers could immediately begin testing it with their products. This beta is not stable and there were reports of issues from those who installed it straight away. Apple updated the first developer beta a few days after the launch. As of August 5 the developer beta is in version 5.\nApple released the first Public Beta on July 24. It corresponds with the the second release of Developer Beta 4 (build 23A5297m).\nBetween WWDC and the official release in the fall, Apple will release a string of beta releases, typically eight or so in total. We have a separate article that details how to join Apple\u2019s beta software program so you can test the new software as soon as the beta arrives.\nAnyone using the beta is encouraged to file bug reports using the included Apple\u2019s Feedback Assistant app so that the company can address them. If you want to learn more about the beta read: What\u2019s in the latest iOS beta and how to get it. And make sure you read why we advise against installing the iOS beta as well as why you shouldn\u2019t install the iOS 26 public beta yet.\n- iOS 26 is a free software update for iPhone 11 and later\n- The iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max will miss out on iOS 26\nApple\nApple has confirmed the following iPhones will get iOS 26, we\u2019ve included the year that phone launched.\n- iPhone 16e (2025)\n- iPhone 16/16 Plus/16 Pro/16 Pro Max (2024)\n- iPhone 15/15 Plus/15 Pro/15 Pro Max (2023)\n- iPhone 14/14 Plus/14 Pro/14 Pro Max (2022)\n- iPhone SE (3rd gen) (2022)\n- iPhone 13/13 mini/13 Pro/13 Pro Max (2021)\n- iPhone 12/12 mini/12 Pro/12 Pro Max (2020)\n- iPhone SE (2nd gen) (2020)\n- iPhone 11/11 Pro/11 Pro Max (2019)\niOS 26 supported devices: Which iPhones get iOS 26\nWhen Apple updates the operating system for its devices it often means that certain models are not compatible with the update. The iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max, which were supported by iOS 18 and launched in 2018, will miss out on iOS 26.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that those 2018 iPhones are unsupported by Apple. Apple will continue to issue security-related software updates to iOS 18 for a few more years. Read about how long iPhones are supported to find out which iPhones are no longer supported with security updates.\nNor does this mean that all the supported iPhones get all the new features. As was the case in 2024, only certain iPhones can support Apple Intelligence powered features. That\u2019s the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and the whole of the iPhone 16 range. This means that if your phone isn\u2019t one of those mentioned you miss out on features such as the Visual Intelligence and Genmoji updates, as well as the Phone app ability to manage your unwanted calls.\nFind out how the new iOS compares with the current version in our comparison of iOS 26 vs iOS 18: What\u2019s different, what\u2019s new, and should you update?\niOS 26 design: Liquid Glass and other design changes\nApple\nDuring the WWDC keynote Apple previewed the new iPhone features coming later in 2025. The biggest change is a visual one: a bold new redesign called Liquid Glass.\nWhat is Liquid Glass?\nThe new design features a graphical user interface that Apple is calling Liquid Glass, which creates a translucent effect that mimics the qualities of glass.\nThe new Liquid Glass theme represents the biggest change to iOS since iOS 7 was introduced in 2013. Back then Apple dropped the skeuomorphic design in favor of flat symbolic icons. This time everything is more curved, less flat, with translucent elements reflecting or refracting the content in the background, and resizing to fit around what is onscreen. The Liquid Glass elements will also change color to reflect the content beneath as you scroll and it will be possible to see blurred and refracted elements of the background through the top layer.\nApple says that it will feel more like interacting with the physical world, with elements dynamically reacting to your touch. The company also says the changes \u201cblur the lines between hardware and software\u201d.\nThis new Liquid Glass design extends to all of Apple\u2019s products and to all of Apple\u2019s apps. You\u2019ll see the effect on the Dock, widgets and icons. Panes, windows, buttons and menus will be presented as translucent layers with specular highlights.\nApple says that it will also make design changes that will simplify app interfaces to make the controls more visible.\nInitial feedback to the new Liquid Glass design was negative with some beta testers complaining that content wasn\u2019t visible due to the overlaying of menus over background images, later versions of the beta have dialled this back to make the menus more visible.\nInterface changes\nApple\nApple is adapting the interface to focus more on what is on the screen rather than cover things with tools and menu bars. Menus will shrink as you scroll to reveal the content below. Apple is also removing some of the clutter from menus to simplify things and emphasise the more frequently used options. For example, rather than occupying a rectangular bar at the bottom of the screen, groups of controls will appear on floating elements that pop out additional controls, change as you move between views, and are tucked away when you scroll.\nThese changes to the menus are designed to make it easier to access the features you use most often, and discover others. Apple is trying to make iOS and its apps more intuitive.\nA good example of how these design changes will be applied is the Lock Screen, which will be more adaptive. The image you choose as your wallpaper will be scaled to fit the height and width of the Lock Screen and positioned to fill the available space around elements like the time. Additionally, the wallpaper image will slide up as notifications come in.\nWe\u2019ll discuss the changes coming to individual apps below, but essentially Apple is making it easier to find the tools you usually use, without the clutter of all the other features you don\u2019t need.\niOS 26 and Apple Intelligence\nApple has been having trouble with some of it\u2019s AI efforts, especially the Siri features that were touted at WWDC 2024. Apple had promised that iOS 18.4 would bring a major update to Siri, where it would be better at natural conversations with the user, using personal context, awareness of what is on screen, and the ability to perform in-app actions.\nApple has since confirmed that these Siri-related features have been pushed back until 2026, which means they should come as an update to iOS 26, perhaps in March, but we could be waiting even longer.\nApple still had a number of impressive Apple Intelligence powered features to show off at WWDC though. In fact, some of the new features coming to Spotlight on the Mac look like some of the features promised for Siri.\nSome of these new Apple Intelligence features will make a big impact in apps, especially the Phone app, which we will discuss below. Another beneficiary of Apple Intelligence is Visual Intelligence, which was introduced in iOS 18 and gains a very useful ability in iOS 26.\nVisual Intelligence in iOS 26\nIDG\nIn iOS 18 you can use Visual Intelligence by holding up the iPhone to view something you are curious about, triggering Visual Intelligence (via the Camera Control button if you have one, or via the Control Centre if not) and viewing information about what you were pointing the camera at. It could identify a building, or offer to add the date from a poster to your calendar, for example. That\u2019s all very well when you are out and about, but what about when you are just browsing the web and want to know where something someone is wearing is from or where a video is being filmed?\nIn iOS 26 it will be possible take a screenshot and look up information about that image and products in it using Visual Intelligence. You can also ask ChatGPT for information about the screenshot.\nGenmoji and Image Playground in iOS 26\nApple\nAlso benefitting from Apple Intelligence is Genmoji, another feature that arrived with iOS 18. Genmoji lets you create custom emoji using AI. To create a Genmoji you type a description in the Describe an Emoji field and tap on Create New Emoji. You can use photos of people you know as a basis and refine the emoji until it represents what you are looking for. The emoji will then be available in your emoji keyboard to use.\nIn iOS 26 the Genmoji interface is getting a redesign. Users will be able to mix two emoji together, or alter an existing emoji to create something new, or even combine an emoji and a Sticker (which can be created from a photo). Users will be able to further customise emoji inside Image Playground, changing expressions.\nImage Playground, which is Apple\u2019s app for making AI-generated images, arrived in iOS 18 and is getting an update in iOS 26. In iOS 26 it will be possible to use ChatGTP styles and prompts, such as an oil painting as well as those provided by Apple to create images in Image Playground.\niOS 26 new apps and updated apps\n- Phone: Call Screening and Hold Assist\n- Translations\n- Camera app overhaul\nWith each iteration of iOS the set of apps Apple provides grows and evolves, and many of the changes coming to the apps on the iPhone are shared by those same apps on Apple\u2019s other devices. iOS 26 is no different.\nThis time some of the upcoming changes are going to be quite transformative to how you use the phone \u2013 and by which we mean the telephone aspect to the iPhone.\nPhone app\nThe phone app might not be the one we use the most, but as Apple says, it is fundamental to the iPhone. With iOS 26 the phone app is getting a big update that essentially turns it into a PA and a spam filtering tool.\nApple is tapping into Apple Intelligence to bring new Voice Mail summaries to surface the most important information, but even more exciting, it is aiming to eliminate unwanted calls with a new Call Screening option that can answer the call in the background, ask the caller to explain their reason for calling, and then provide a text summary of those details to you before you decide whether or not to take the call. Of course this may make it harder to ignore calls from people you ought to actually speak to, but it will be a good way to siphon off spam and hoax calls from unknown numbers.\nThat\u2019s not all. Another new feature is Hold Assist, which will automatically detect hold music and mute the call until it is connected to an agent. As a result you can get things done without having to keep your phone speaker playing irritating hold music until someone answers. When an agent becomes free they will be informed that you are there and your phone will ring alerting you to the connection and you can take the call. It\u2019s going to be like having your own receptionist.\nAnother change in the Phone app should make it impossible to accidentally tap on contact in the Recents list and call them. Currently, if you tap on a name in your Recents list it will automatically call that person. A new setting will allow you to turn off \u201cTap Recents to Call\u201d.\nLive Translations\nAlso coming to the Phone app, but also present as a features in Messages and FaceTime, is Live Translations, which will help you communicate with someone who speaks another language.\nWith this feature you will be able to have a conversation with some who speaks a different language to you. If you are familiar with the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy this is almost at the level of having a Bable Fish.\nIf you are speaking to some via the phone app the iPhone will translate what it being said, with a spoken voice translating what has been said into your language. The recipient will also hear translations in their own language. Apparently they don\u2019t need to have an iPhone. The main restriction right now is that Live Translation for Phone is available only for one-on-one calls in English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish.\nAs we said above, it\u2019s not only the Phone app that will get the Live Translation features. FaceTime and Messages will as well. And Translation is also finding its way into the Music app.\nFaceTime\nWhen speaking to someone via FaceTime you will see real-time captions in your own language. Live Captions aren\u2019t entirely new to FaceTime, you can already turn on that functionality in Accessibility > Live Captions \u2013 although this only works if your language is set to English U.S.\nAs well as the new Live Translation feature, FaceTime also gets changes to the interface designed to surface the controls you need while keeping the caller visible. For example, controls float to the bottom right and recede when you don\u2019t need them.\nThe FaceTime call list also gets a new look, with video messages autoplaying as you scroll.\nMessages\nApple\nIf you are using Messages to communicate with someone who speaks a different language what you type is translated into their language and vice versa.\nAs with the phone, Messages is getting a screening tool to combat spam. On-device spam detection will give you \u201ctotal control over who appears in your conversation list,\u201d according to Apple.\nIt is already possible to filter out spam by using the Unknown Senders list in Messages, but in iOS 26 Messages will have a greater ability to screen for spam, and it will make sure you still receive verification codes and other critical or time sensitive messages.\nAlso in Messages you will be able to add a background image to Group Chats and a new option to create a poll will be available. Messages will even suggest a poll if a situation calls for one. Anyone can add options to the poll, as well.\nThose who have access to Apple Cash (still U.S. only) can also access this from group chats.\nA small but brilliant update coming to Messages is the ability to copy parts of a text, rather than the whole thing. This is one of those incomprehensible failures of Messages on iPhone right now: the only option is to copy the entire message, paste it, and then edit out what you don\u2019t want. When using Messages on the Mac you can just copy the part of the Message you need. So it\u2019s a long overdue feature for iPhone Messages.\nApple\nMusic\nIn Apple Music you will be able to follow the lyrics alongside the translation into your own language. For some languages you will even see a pronunciation guide.\nAlso coming to the Music app is a new auto-mix option that uses AI to fade between songs and match beats like a DJ would.\nThere is also a new animated Apple Music artwork option for the Lock Screen.\nInterface changes should also mean it is faster and easier to get to the music you are in to. For example, you can pin your favourite album or playlist to the top of your library.\nApple\nCamera & Photos\nIn iOS 26, Apple is redesigned camera app, hiding most of the lesser used camera shooting modes and options to simplify the increasingly cramped layout and giving users quick access to settings.\nIn the Photos app there will be the ability to add 3D effects to photos.\nWe have a separate article covering how to use the iOS 26 Camera app, including where to find camera modes and features, how to change capture settings and how to use AirPods as a remote.\nGames\nApple is finally tidying up the gaming experience on the iPhone with a brand new Games app. With half a billion people playing games on iPad, according to Apple, it\u2019s about time.\nApple says it is creating a new destination to help its gamers get more out of their games. The Games app will offer various tabs to make finding the games you are playing or have played easier. The Home tab reveals what\u2019s most relevant to you. The Library tab shows all the games you have ever downloaded.\nThere is also a Play Together tab where you can see what your friends are playing, play games with them, compare scores, and invite them to play games. You can also challenge them to beat your highest score in single player games. Turning single player games into fun competitions with friends, with scores in real time. This will be Apple\u2019s second attempt to get users to connect socially: remember iTunes Ping? (Apple would probably rather you forgot).\nApple\nAnother change coming to gaming on iPhone (and iPad) is a new consistency to hoe touch controls are applied in games. Developers working on an iPhone or iPad game that requires more advanced controls have always had to design their own touch controls, and this can be inconsistent. In iOS 26, Apple will provides its own touch controls for buttons, thumbsticks, dpads, throttles, and touchpads.\nApple Wallet\nLike Apple Cash many of the new Apple Wallet features are U.S. only, such as the ability to add Drivers Licenses to Apple Wallet.\nApple says there will be more ways to pay with Apple Pay in iOS 26, for example you can redeem points or choose to pay in instalments. That feature is currently available in nine states. From the fall Apple says it will be possible to add a U.S. passport, but only for use for flights inside the U.S.\nThere will be a new API for developers to take advantage of, enabling them to provide customers with more information within the Wallet app, such as details of the services included with the fare and upgrade options that can be accessed from within the Wallet app.\nYou can also track Apple Pay orders, with Apple Intelligence finding the order details and tracking information and keeping them together for you.\nPasswords & Autofill\nThe Passwords app, introduced in iOS 18, is also getting an update. You can check changes that you\u2019ve made to accounts logged in the Passwords app, view previous passwords that were used for these accounts and see when they were altered.\nIn addition, iOS 26, Apple is introducing improvements that will make using passkeys easier. Passkeys is an authentication method that replaces traditional passwords with security keys and biometrics. Many apps and websites already provide support for passkeys, and with the iOS 26 update, it will be possible for iPhone and iPad apps to enable users to create a passkey with just a tap. Passkeys can be authenticated with Face ID or Touch ID, and credentials will be synchronized between your Apple devices via iCloud.\nIt will also be possible to pre-fill personal data, such as name and email, so you no longer have to waste time filling in long sign-up forms. Even better, iOS 26 will be able to autofill verification codes from Gmail and WhatsApp. Verification code autofill may also work in Google Chrome, currently verification codes only work with Apple\u2019s Safari browser.\nApple Maps\nApple\nThe Maps app also gets an update, using Apple Intelligence to understand your regular commutes and learn your favourites. With this information it will be able to warn you if you should take a different route due to traffic.\nAnother change to Maps is that if you want it to it can log (with encryption) Visited Places, which will make it easier to find and recall places you have been to in the past. It\u2019s easy to delete this history too.\nReminders\nIn iOS 26, Reminders will suggest things such as tasks and grocery items, plus follow-ups based on your emails or other text on your iPhone, Mac, and more.\nNotes\nNotes will gain Markdown.\nWeather\nSatellite-based weather.\nClock\nYou will finally be able to set a snooze duration of between one and 15 minutes, rather than being stuck with set eight minute snoozes!\nYou will also gain the ability to set alarms from inside other apps. For example, you could set an alarm from within a recipe app without you needing to open the Clock.\nAirPods related features: Pause Media When Falling Asleep\nExisting AirPods should get some new features due to the iOS 26 update. These include a new feature that will enable AirPods to pause when they sense the wearer has fallen asleep. Code in the iOS 26 beta indicates that this feature is tied to iOS 26, rather than the AirPods line specifically \u2013 it may even work on Apple\u2019s Beats headphones.\nIn addition it will be possible to easily switch between different audio input devices \u2013 so you could switch from AirPods as dedicated microphones to another device, for example.\nOther new features in iOS 26\nThere are lots of other changes coming to iOS itself, many of which will improve the overall experience.\nRunning tasks in the background\niOS 26 will have a new API for running tasks in the background. So you won\u2019t have to keep an app open when they\u2019re doing something important, such as uploading files or exporting a video. Users can switch to other apps without interrupting the previous task.\nAdaptive Power Mode\nThis feature aims to extend battery life by adjusting performance based on usage patterns. Where Low Power Mode throttles your iPhone\u2019s performance and kills certain background activities to save energy, Adaptive Power Mode makes smaller adjustments to your iPhone\u2019s performance based on how you use it. As a result the impact should be subtler, and potentially something users could keep on at all times.\nBattery Intelligence: AI-powered battery management\niOS 26 will introduce a feature dubbed Battery Intelligence. This presents the estimated charging duration to reach 80% (then 100%) when connected to a charger \u2013 so you know how long you will need to change your iPhone before you can leave the house.\nA new adaptive low power mode has been spotted in the iOS 26 developer beta. This doesn\u2019t replace the regular low power mode (that\u2019s still around) but instead uses machine learning to make adjustments that could help eke out a little more juice from your battery.\nIn addition, the Lock Screen will now display estimated charging times to hit 80 percent and 100 percent battery power.\nRCS Universal Profile 3.0 and other Android \u2018friendly\u2019 features\nSupport for RCS Universal Profile 3.0 may come in an update to iOS 26. RCS 3.0 will encrypt iPhone-to-Android messages, and offer other features to make communicating between iPhones and Android phones more seamless. Currently, Android users can edit a message within 15 minutes of it being sent \u2013 this works in iOS 18.5 and the iOS 26 developer beta but the iPhone displays the edited message as a new one with an asterisk rather than replacing the message with the edited message.\niPhone users are able to edit messages sent to other iPhones, but they are not yet able to edit RCS messages sent to an Android phone. RCS 3.0 should also make this available to iPhone users.\nThere also be simplified eSIM transfer from Android."
