      "feedback": "Actionable upgrade in one paragraph: tighten the 0–3 week framing by naming explicit, testable catalysts and tying them directly to market transmission, then attach sources to each claim and tighten the causal chain. Specifically: (a) anchor the core immediate driver to I2SJU04DF (Houthis’ new sub‑munition missile and Israel’s strikes near Sanaa, two power plants, a fuel depot, and Red Sea ports; “More than 10 fighter jets,” and the operation “Black Flag”) and phrase the causal chain as: missile/strike escalation → potential Red Sea shipping disruptions and port advisories → energy/shipping risk premia and risk-off flows in FX/equities; (b) treat NBX9RA9WX as a separate risk pulse (gas‑cylinder blast at Detsky Mir in Moscow; one dead, injuries, evacuation) that incrementally raises geopolitical/security risk sentiment but does not directly alter the Middle East channel; (c) quantify clearly where possible (e.g., 2,000 km furthest target distance; 10+ jets; two power plants; at least one death; evictions/evacuations) and keep all numeric references tied to I2SJU04DF or NBX9RA9WX; (d) specify near‑term transmission channels beyond sentiment by naming observable indicators: UKMTO shipping advisories/port closures, explicit Israeli/Houthi statements about target expansion or de‑escalation, and energy/commodity price moves or shipping‑related stock/ETF reactions; (e) add a concise two‑path scenario: escalation/de-escalation with triggers (new missiles or no new missiles for 48–72 hours) and the corresponding market behavior (risk‑off vs. risk‑on/off switch); (f) define thresholds and invalidation: credible de‑escalation signals (no new missiles or strikes for several days, resumed shipping activity, and stable headlines) invalidate the near‑term risk pulse; (g) deliver a compact monitoring checklist and avoid extrapolating non‑sourced market numbers; (h) sharpen language to world‑class standard (replace “regime” with precise phrasing; ensure every assertion has a source tag); (i) ensure citation density by placing (I2SJU04DF) after the Middle East chain and (NBX9RA9WX) after the Moscow incident, and reference the 2,000 km distance, “more than 10 jets,” and the two power plants as explicit data points from I2SJU04DF; (j) if possible, add a minimal, evidence‑based expectation range for risk premia (e.g., short‑term volatility uptick and a drag on risk assets until a de‑escalation signal appears) tied to the two sources.",
