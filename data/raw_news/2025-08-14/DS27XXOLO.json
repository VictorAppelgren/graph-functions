  "description": "Washington police can now share traffic stop information with federal immigration authorities under new directive approved by federalized police chief.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump said a new directive allowing the Metropolitan Police Department to disclose information to federal immigration authorities about those they pull over at traffic stops is a step in the right direction \u2014 and signaled that other cities could also face a similar policy.\n\nThe order, which Police Chief Pamela Smith approved Thursday, comes as Trump moved to federalize the nation\u2019s capital\u2019s police force and mobilize 800 National Guard troops to address crime in Washington.\n\n\"What you're saying is that it was a very positive thing,\" Trump told reporters about the new order Thursday. \"When they stop people, they find they're illegal, they report them, they give them to us, etc., that's a very positive thing.\"\n\nDEFENSE SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH VOWS TO BE 'FORCE MULTIPLIERS' OF DC POLICE\n\n\"I have heard that it just happened,\" Trump said. \"That's a great step. That's a great step if they're doing that. Yeah. I think that's going to happen all over the country. We want to stop crime. I think if the Democrats aren't strong on this issue, they won't be able to do it.\"\n\nThe order means that Metropolitan Police can share details about their interactions with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\nIn addition to Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem also hailed the new order a success earlier Thursday.\n\n\"That means that as soon as they encounter somebody who is committing a crime, they will share that with ICE and we will be able to get those illegal criminals out of this country and we\u2019ll make America safer,\" Noem told Fox News Thursday.\n\nTRUMP TAKES CONTROL OF METRO POLICE, DEPLOYS NATIONAL GUARD TO TAKE ON WASHINGTON CRIME\n\nNow that the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington has been federalized, it remains under the authority of Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nA temporary federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is permitted under emergency circumstances. However, Trump's move will likely be challenged in court over whether the situation in Washington qualifies as an emergency.\n\nNational Guard troops started to arrive in Washington Wednesday. These troops are reserve forces that respond to state and federal operations, typically in accordance with orders from their state governments.\n\nTrump has deviated from the norm though, and mobilized National Guard troops from California to respond to immigration riots in June. By doing so, he bypassed California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nHowever, Washington is different because the federal government oversees the District of Columbia National Guard.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats on Capitol Hill have decried Trump\u2019s attempt to federalize the police and bring in National Guard troops.\n\n\"First, Donald Trump used the Marines and the National Guard to support his mass deportation agenda in Los Angeles,\" . \"Now, he's using similar tactics in D.C. like a tinpot dictator. Don't look away. Don't stay silent. If you do, don't be surprised if it's your city next.\"",

Hegseth also teased 800 National Guard troops will be deployed \"in the coming week.\"\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\nThis comes after recent acts of violence in the capital city made national headlines, including a former DOGE staffer being assaulted and a 21-year-old congressional intern being fatally caught in the crossfire of a drive-by shooting a mile away from the White House in June.\n\"If our capital city is a mess, if we can't control our capital city, then what does the rest of the country look like?\" Hegseth asked.\nWhen Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked how long the troops will be in the nation\u2019s capital, Hegseth called their deployment \"conditions-based,\" emphasizing the administration will support all parts of law enforcement to \"make sure people who are arrested are actually locked up.\"\nTRUMP ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO ADDRESS \u2018TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL\u2019 CRIME IN WASHINGTON\n\"That's why the president's talking about cashless bail and sanctuary cities,\" Hegseth explained. \"If you're illegal here in D.C., that's going to be a problem. So all of these things that apply to law and order are front and center for us.\"\nThe National Guard could be deployed for weeks or months, but when they should pull out is ultimately the \"president\u2019s call,\" Hegseth added.\nHegseth also responded to accusations the Trump administration is acting as \"authoritarians\" would, insisting these critiques are no different than what he heard when they \"quelled the protests of the attacks on ICE officers\" in Los Angeles in June.\n\"I was told, \u2018Oh, you're going to lock up political opponents, you're going to go after Democrats,\u2019 yada yada. It's the same stuff every time. Mischaracterizing our intentions,\" Hegseth argued.\nHe continued, \"The intentions of this president is to establish law and order using legal and lawful and constitutional means, which he completely has, and you know why they don't like him? He's got the guts to do it.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn June, President Donald Trump had ordered 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, despite Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s, D-Calif, strong stance against it."

This directive allows local police to share information with federal immigration authorities, a move Trump and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem praised as a step towards enhancing public safety.
