County fire captain faked work injury to collect insurance, prosecutors allege\n- Share via\nA Los Angeles County Fire Department captain is facing felony charges following allegations that he faked a work injury and forged doctors\u2019 notes to fraudulently claim thousands of dollars in disability payments, authorities said.\nThomas Merryman, 45, allegedly received more than $25,000 in insurance payments for a work injury that could not have taken place because he was not at work, according to the L.A. County district attorney\u2019s office.\nHe allegedly submitted fake paperwork under the name of another fire captain and a physician to Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company, allowing him to claim long-term disability payments, prosecutors said.\nA former Westminster police officer is accused of faking an injury and fraudulently claiming $600,000 in workers\u2019 compensation while she was partying at Stagecoach, visiting Disneyland and skiing at Mammoth Mountain, officials say.\nMerryman, who is currently believed to live in Georgetown, Texas, has been charged with one felony count of insurance fraud, one felony count of false personation and two felony counts of forgery, prosecutors said. He is scheduled to be arraigned in Los Angeles on Sept. 9.\nIf convicted as charged, he faces up to five years in state prison, authorities said.\nThe statement from the district attorney\u2019s office did not provide any additional information on Merryman\u2019s history with the department, or his current employment status. According to Transparent California, an online database that tracks pay to public officials, a man of the same name and identified as a captain with L.A. County fire, received $178,466 in total pay and $112,687 in benefits in 2024.\n\u201cFake disability claims will not be tolerated under my watch, especially by first responders charged with keeping our county safe,\u201d L.A. County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman said in a statement. \u201cFalse healthcare claims raise insurance premiums and make it more difficult for people with legitimate work injuries to claim benefits. My message to public servants who abuse the system is clear: We are watching you.\u201d"

County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nThe man, whom deputies declined to identify, is accused of illegally impersonating an officer and carrying a loaded firearm in public, according to Sgt. Jose Arias, the watch commander at the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Industry Station.\nArias said the impersonator had made multiple unlawful traffic stops over several months, but noted that investigators were not aware whether the man had taken any enforcement action, such as requesting ticket payments or detaining anyone. Arias did not know under what circumstances the man is suspected of pulling people over, but said the investigation is ongoing.\nSherrif\u2019s officials shared photos of the arrest, which showed the man wearing a patch reading \u201cMotor officer\u201d and \u201cTraffic\u201d on a navy-blue uniform. He was riding a motorcycle that appeared to be equipped with red and blue lights, and carried a tactical vest with a silver badge. He also had what appeared to be a gun, a baton and a body camera.\nOfficials said the man made the phony traffic stops in the eastern Valinda area near Nogales High School in La Puente. Detectives ask that anyone who was pulled over by the impersonator to contact the Sheriff\u2019s Department."

The facility was placed on lockdown, with incoming ambulance traffic rerouted to other hospitals, she said.\nThe hospital resumed normal operations around 6:30 p.m., according to spokesperson Dorey Huston.\nHospital employees were sent a text at 5:41 p.m. saying: \u201cHuntington Hospital received a Code Silver threat via phone. Facility on lockdown, but no need to shelter in place.\u201d\nAn all-clear was declared at Loma Linda University Children\u2019s Hospital on Wednesday evening after a \u2018swatting\u2019 call reporting an armed man.\nCode Silver is a hospital code for a person with a weapon, an active shooter or a hostage situation, according to the Hospital Assn. of Southern California.\nEmployees received an \u201call-clear\u201d alert shortly before 7:30 p.m., according to copies of the messages reviewed by The Times.\nThe Los Angeles Police Department took a suspect into custody around 6:30 p.m and then transferred him to the Pasadena Police Department, which is the lead agency for the incident, Derderian said. No immediate information was available on what he might be charged with.\nThis incident comes on the heels of two \u201cswatting\u201d calls that prompted significant law enforcement responses in Southern California.\nSwatting is the name for a false crime or emergency being reported at a specific location to provoke an aggressive law enforcement response, often by a SWAT team.\nDozens of heavily armed deputies swarmed Loma Linda University Children\u2019s Hospital on Wednesday evening after a caller told officials he was planning on \u201cshooting up\u201d the San Bernardino County medical facility.\nAn 18-year-old from Lancaster has pleaded guilty to making hundreds of calls falsely threatening to conduct shootings or detonate bombs at public facilities.\nThen on Thursday evening, students were warned to shelter in place at the five undergraduate colleges in the Claremont consortium after the Claremont Police Department received a call warning of a gunman on the campus of Claremont McKenna College.\nNeither the Loma Linda Hospital nor the Claremont McKenna calls were deemed credible threats, and it is unknown whether any of the incidents are related."
