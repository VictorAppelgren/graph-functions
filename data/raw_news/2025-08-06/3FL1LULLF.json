  "content": "PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. (WATE) \u2014 As Dollywood continues to welcome visitors for its 40th year of operation, the Pigeon Forge-based theme park has once again been recognized as one of the most popular theme parks in the world.\n\nTripadvisor officials named Dollywood the number one theme park in the U.S. as part of its 2025 Travelers\u2019 Choice Best of the Best Awards. This marks the third time in the last four years that the park has garnered the top spot.\n\nSee the full top 10 below:\n\nSee the complete list on the Tripadvisor website.\n\nDollywood was also the only U.S.-based theme park to make the top 15 of Tripadvisor\u2019s 2025 worldwide rankings, coming in at No. 11 on that list.\n\nThe 165-acre theme park is co-owned by Dolly Parton\u2019s entertainment company, Dolly Parton Productions, and Herschend Family Entertainment. Annual attendance regularly eclipses two million visitors, according to dollywood.com.\n\nDollywood is the largest employer in Sevier County and a 2021 study by the Tennessee Department of Transportation found that the park had an annual direct economic impact of $1.8 billion.\n\nWhile Parton famously does not ride roller coasters, the park has consistently added new attractions for visitors to enjoy.\n\n\u201cIf I get on that thing, you\u2019d find my wigs on one of those trees,\u201d she joked in 2023 about the new \u201cBig Bear Mountain\u201d roller coaster that can reach speeds up to 48 mph.\n\nPark officials revealed ahead of the 2025 season that plans are in the works for a new ride that is the \u201cbiggest, most ambitious and possibly the most expensive project that the park has undertaken.\u201d While project details have not yet been revealed, they said that visitors will \u201ctake flight\u201d in 2026.\n\nThe awards are based on traveler reviews and ratings during a 12-month period. Travelers\u2019 Choice Best of the Best award winners are among the top 1 percent of listings, according to Tripadvisor.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t provide the best guest experience in the country to try to win these awards,\u201d said Dollywood Parks & Resorts President Eugene Naughton in a statement. \u201cWe do it because it is the right thing to do. Our guests have options on where they can spend their time, and when they choose to visit us, we want to give them a world-class experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis award is humbling though, because it is derived from real reviews left by our actual guests describing their time here at our parks and resorts,\u201d he added.",
