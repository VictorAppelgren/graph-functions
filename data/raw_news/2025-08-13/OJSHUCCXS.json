  "title": "Weatherford International plc (NASDAQ:WFRD) Shares Could Be 36% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",
  "description": "NasdaqGS:WFRD 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Weatherford International's Fair Values from the Community and...",
  "content": "Explore Weatherford International's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\u2022 Weatherford International's estimated fair value is US$88.65 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\u2022 Our fair value estimate is 29% higher than Weatherford International's analyst price target of US$68.63 Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Weatherford International plc (NASDAQ:WFRD) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free. We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.1b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 3.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$7.2b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$3.2b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$6.4b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$56.7, the company appears quite good value at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Weatherford International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.129. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\u2022 Debt is not viewed as a risk.\n\u2022 Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\u2022 Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Energy Services market.\n\u2022 Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\u2022 Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\u2022 Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market. Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?
