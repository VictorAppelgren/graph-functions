      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Add explicit citations**: Every quantitative claim (22.4 % revenue growth, 8.1 % net margin by 2028, $610 M earnings, $483 fair value, 6.4 % upside, 20 % YoY ARR target, 25 bp Fed hike, 3–5 % price lift) must be linked to the source ID KNWKYIQ1W or, where the article does not provide the data, marked as an *assumption* and cited as such.  \n2. **Quantify margin drag**: State the current net loss ($‑172.3 M) and net margin (‑4.17 %) from the article, and project the margin improvement path (e.g., “net margin to 8.1 % by 2028 if Falcon adoption hits 20 % YoY ARR”).  \n3. **Clarify macro link**: Re‑phrase “broader cybersecurity sector’s valuation dynamics, which are sensitive to Fed tightening and credit conditions” to a causal chain: “Fed tightening compresses the high‑growth tech spread, reducing investor appetite for CRWD’s premium (KNWKYIQ1W).”  \n4. **Specify watch signals**: Replace vague “Falcon adoption metrics” with concrete indicators: “Quarterly ARR growth, churn rate, and average contract value (ACV) lift.”  \n5. **Remove drift**: The sentence “Conversely, a sustained rally in cloud‑security demand, driven by AI workloads and hybrid‑workforce expansion, would reinforce the revenue growth narrative and support a 3–5 % price appreciation over the next 4–6 months (KNWKYIQ1W)” is acceptable but add a footnote that the 3–5 % price lift is an *assumption* based on historical AI‑driven security spend growth.  \n6. **Ensure consistency with naming policy**: Use the ticker “CRWD” (no underscore) and keep all handles in canonical form.  \n7. **Add confidence rationale**: Quantify the confidence level (e.g., “Confidence 70 %”) and justify it with the strength of revenue engine versus margin uncertainty.  \n8. **Avoid redundant macro references**: Remove any mention of Fed or credit conditions that cannot be directly tied to CRWD’s valuation unless explicitly linked as an assumption.  \n\n**Flagged drifting sentence**:  \n- “In the short term, the key transmission channels are the Q3 earnings guidance, the pace of Falcon adoption, and the broader cybersecurity sector’s valuation dynamics, which are sensitive to Fed tightening and credit conditions.”  \n*Action*: Re‑frame to explicitly connect Fed tightening to CRWD’s spread compression, or remove the macro reference if not directly supported.",
