      "feedback": "The draft is a solid start but needs to be reframed into a formal, multi‑year regime map with explicit first‑principles anchors, a disciplined transmission to market pricing, and a numeric base/alternative scenarios; right now the causal chain is plausible but not tightly anchored to invariants or triggers, and the narrative relies on a few anecdotes rather than a calibrated, source‑backed framework. Actionable edits: (1) lay out an explicit regime framework anchored in first‑principles—persistent inflation and long‑horizon healthcare costs (aging demographics) as the structural cost driver; cloud/AI productivity as the durable earnings driver for moated tech (cite YVQU6QCY4, 0G3A676BP, and IGP1Q4ZEJ); include a policy/tariff shock channel (cite IGP1Q4ZEJ) and a simple real‑rate/discount‑rate transmission rule to valuation. (2) convert the narrative into a regime map with transitions and triggers: Regime A (tech/moat growth with manageable inflation), Regime B (inflation/healthcare cost acceleration or tariff shock) and Regime C (policy uncertainty/regulatory headwinds); specify transition conditions (e.g., tariff announcements that lift inflation, DOJ/regulatory probes on UNH, AI adoption tempo) and invalidate when triggers reverse. (3) quantify the base case and alternatives using the sources: cite Morningstar’s 3.7% safe withdrawal rate as a baseline risk constraint; cite the Yale Budget Lab projection of a ~3,800 per year hit to purchasing power from tariffs; cite Social Security average ~$2,002/mo and ~31% of elderly income from Social Security; cite long‑term care cost magnitudes (e.g., the $500k planning figure and nursing‑facility costs from the 4 Retirement Expenses piece) to anchor budget stress-test inputs; cite UNH/LULU specifics only to illustrate how idiosyncratic risks matter under the regime framework (IGP1Q4ZEJ, YVQU6QCY4, 0G3A676BP, 4 Retirement Expenses). (4) structure the argument structure: a base case with explicit numbers, an upside case (AI/cloud growth accelerates cash flow and margin expansion, discount rates compress) and a downside case (tariff/inflation shock or regulatory headwinds compress earnings); for each, give a concise transmission chain (from macro anchor → retiree budget/consumption choices → equity/sector pricing) and assign a short confidence level. (5) increase the density and accuracy of citations by mapping each assertion to a specific ID and reconciling conflicts (e.g., Burry’s UNH/LULU bets vs the cloud/AI growth thesis from 0G3A676BP); explicitly acknowledge any tensions (e.g., near‑term UNH earnings risk vs long‑term moat/value case in IGP1Q4ZEJ). (6) trim prose for format constraints: add a short “base case, risks, what to watch, confidence” block, and add 1–2 simple figures/boxes describing the regime map and the key triggers, rather than weaving all points into a single paragraph. If you implement these steps, the piece will meet the SECTION FOCUS (multi‑year horizon, first‑principles anchors, regimes, transition conditions, base case and risk), improve quantitative rigor, and elevate citation discipline across all critical sources (YVQU6QCY4, 0G3A676BP, IGP1Q4ZEJ, 4 Retirement Expenses).",
