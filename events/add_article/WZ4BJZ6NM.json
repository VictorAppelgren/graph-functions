      "summary": "New Mexico has lost over 70% of its river reservoir storage in recent decades, while groundwater withdrawals outpace recharge, leading to reduced water deliveries to Texas. The state legislature earmarked $65 million for settlements and infrastructure, supplemented by federal funds, but additional financing is still required. Farmers have shifted to drip irrigation to conserve water, yet face increasing costs and pressure to use even less water.",
