  "description": "The White House announced it would institute a review of Smithsonian museums to ensure they display \u201chistorically accurate\u201d information.",
  "content": "The Smithsonian, according to former senior historian and curator David C. Ward, is \u201cthe greatest museum in the world.\u201d That\u2019s why he sees the massive changes sought by the Trump administration as \u201cdemoralizing\u201d and \u201cfarcical.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Smithsonian doesn\u2019t need to be made great again. The Smithsonian is great,\u201d said Ward, who spent more than four decades at the institution and primarily worked at the National Portrait Gallery. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex of museums that does everything from astrophysics at Harvard to tropical diseases and plants in Panama to the portrait gallery to the newer museums. It\u2019s a stupendous representation of American culture.\u201d\n\nWard is one of a growing group of historians decrying President Donald Trump\u2019s increasing attacks on the institution. In a letter sent to Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie Bunch , Trump announced a ahead of the 250th anniversary of the country\u2019s founding.\n\n\u201cMuseums should begin implementing content corrections where necessary, replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions across placards, wall didactics, digital displays, and other public-facing materials,\u201d the letter, , read.\n\nThe letter followed a which threatened the prohibition of \u201cexpenditure on exhibits or programs\u201d which \u201cdegrade shared American values\u201d or \u201cdivide Americans based on race.\u201d Particularly, the order noted the American Women\u2019s History Museum should not \u201crecognize men as women in any respect.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the official actions, Trump has spoken publicly on the issues he believes the Smithsonian has, including when he said the museum is too focused on \u201chow bad slavery was.\u201d In May, he National Portrait Gallery director Kim Sajet, though it was unclear whether he had the authority to do so. She .\n\n\u201cAs President Trump promised, the Trump Administration is committed to rooting out Woke and divisive ideology in our government and institutions. Taxpayer money should not be used for things that pit Americans against one another. Our Smithsonian should exhibit history in an accurate, honest, and factual way\u201d White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement.\n\nIn July, prominent artist Amy Sherald from the National Portrait Gallery after she claimed the museum considered removing a painting depicting a transgender woman as the Statue of Liberty. The museum denied Sherald\u2019s claims, but the White House appeared to celebrate her decision.\n\n\u201cThe Statue of Liberty is not an abstract canvas for political expression \u2014 it is a revered and solemn symbol of freedom, inspiration, and national unity that defines the American spirit,\u201d White House special assistant to the president Lindsey Halligan , whom Trump has charged with helping lead his review of the Smithsonian, said in a statement at the time.\n\nSpencer Crew, the former director of the National Museum of American History \u2014 one of the museums on the list for review by the White House \u2014 said the administration\u2019s efforts are \u201cunfortunate\u201d and feel \u201ca bit like censorship.\u201d\n\nCrew, who worked at the Smithsonian for 20 years, emphasized he always felt like the work done by the Smithsonian\u2019s employees were based on \u201csound scholarship.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the goal always is to make sure the exhibits they do are based on the best scholarship and, in creating them, work with experts in the field so they can try to make sure the information they present is based in the latest scholarship and coming from those people who are doing the research,\u201d he said.\n\nThe American Alliance of Museums, a group that advocates for \u201cequitable and impactful\u201d museums, warned in a statement that \u201cgrowing threats\u201d of censorship could create a \u201cchilling effect\u201d for \u201cthe entire museum sector.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cFreedom of thought and expression are foundational American values, and museums uphold them by creating spaces where people can engage with history, science, art, and culture in ways that are honest, fact-based, and thought-provoking,\u201d .\n\nIn a poll of 1,220 self-identified registered voters , 60 percent said they opposed the Trump administration\u2019s review of the Smithsonian. The balance of 33 percent said they support it.\n\nWard said there are historical events in America\u2019s past that should be \u201cquestioned\u201d or \u201creevaluated.\u201d But, he said, it\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d to visit Smithsonian museums and \u201cnot be inspired by what we\u2019ve done as a country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf all you want to do is have a static view on what America is \u2014 the kind of enshrinement and symbols of American history and democracy \u2014 and that never changes, you\u2019re not going to want to go to the Smithsonian, because the Smithsonian is the complete variety of American history, and it\u2019s going to be disorienting to you,\u201d Ward said. \u201cWhat I would always hope was you come to the Smithsonian and you learn that things are not always as they were in the past.\u201d",

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose and Policy. Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation\u2019s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth. This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light. Under this historical revision, our Nation\u2019s unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed. Rather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame, disregarding the progress America has made and the ideals that continue to inspire millions around the globe.\nThe prior administration advanced this corrosive ideology. At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \u2014 where our Nation declared that all men are created equal \u2014 the prior administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates dismantling \u201cWestern foundations\u201d and \u201cinterrogating institutional racism\u201d and pressured National Historical Park rangers that their racial identity should dictate how they convey history to visiting Americans because America is purportedly racist.\nOnce widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology. This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive. For example, the Smithsonian American Art Museum today features \u201cThe Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,\u201d an exhibit representing that \u201c[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\u201d The exhibit further claims that \u201csculpture has been a powerful tool in promoting scientific racism\u201d and promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating \u201cRace is a human invention.\u201d\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture has proclaimed that \u201chard work,\u201d \u201cindividualism,\u201d and \u201cthe nuclear family\u201d are aspects of \u201cWhite culture.\u201d The forthcoming Smithsonian American Women\u2019s History Museum plans on celebrating the exploits of male athletes participating in women\u2019s sports. These are just a few examples.\nIt is the policy of my Administration to restore Federal sites dedicated to history, including parks and museums, to solemn and uplifting public monuments that remind Americans of our extraordinary heritage, consistent progress toward becoming a more perfect Union, and unmatched record of advancing liberty, prosperity, and human flourishing. Museums in our Nation\u2019s capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history.\nTo advance this policy, we will restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness \u2013- igniting the imagination of young minds, honoring the richness of American history and innovation, and instilling pride in the hearts of all Americans.\nSec. 2. Saving Our Smithsonian. (a) The Vice President, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Staff Secretary, Lindsey Halligan, Esq., shall work to effectuate the policies of this order through his role on the Smithsonian Board of Regents with respect to the Smithsonian Institution and its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo, including by seeking to remove improper ideology from such properties, and shall recommend to the President any additional actions necessary to fully effectuate such policies.\n(b) The Vice President and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall work with the Congress to ensure that future appropriations to the Smithsonian Institution:\n(i) prohibit expenditure on exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy; and\n(ii) celebrate the achievements of women in the American Women\u2019s History Museum and do not recognize men as women in any respect in the Museum.\n(c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Interior shall take any other measures within their authority to promote the policy of this order.\n(d) As appropriate, the Vice President shall, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Staff Secretary, Lindsey Halligan, Esq., work with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate Majority Leader, to seek the appointment of citizen members to the Smithsonian Board of Regents committed to advancing the policy of this order.\nSec. 3. Restoring Independence Hall. The Secretary of the Interior shall provide sufficient funding, as available, to improve the infrastructure of Independence National Historical Park, which shall be complete by July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\nSec. 4. Restoring Truth in American History.\n(a) The Secretary of the Interior shall:\n(i) determine whether, since January 1, 2020, public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior\u2019s jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology;\n(ii) take action to reinstate the pre-existing monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties, as appropriate and consistent with 43 U.S.C. 1451 et seq., 54 U.S.C. 100101 et seq.,and other applicable law; and\n(iii) take action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to ensure that all public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior\u2019s jurisdiction do not contain descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times), and instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features, the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.\nSec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDONALD J. TRUMP\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nMarch 27, 2025."

Bunch III\nSecretary, Smithsonian Institution\n1000 Jefferson Dr SW\nWashington, DC 20560\nSubject: Internal Review of Smithsonian Exhibitions and Materials\nDear Secretary Bunch,\nWe wish to begin by expressing our appreciation for the brief tour you gave us recently of the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and by acknowledging your work on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution, as well as the Institution\u2019s role in shaping public understanding of American history and culture. We are completely aligned with your statement that the Smithsonian is \u201ca welcoming place of knowledge and discovery for all Americans.\u201d We are grateful that you and the Board of Regents have expressed your commitment to the non-partisan, educational mission of this great institution.\nAs we prepare to celebrate the 250th anniversary of our Nation\u2019s founding, it is more important than ever that our national museums reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story. In this spirit, and in accordance with Executive Order 14253, Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History, we will be leading a comprehensive internal review of selected Smithsonian museums and exhibitions. This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President\u2019s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\nThis review is a constructive and collaborative effort \u2014 one rooted in respect for the Smithsonian\u2019s vital mission and its extraordinary contributions. Our goal is not to interfere with the day-to-day operations of curators or staff, but rather to support a broader vision of excellence that highlights historically accurate, uplifting, and inclusive portrayals of America\u2019s heritage.\nThe review will focus on several key areas:\n- Public-facing Content: A review of exhibition text, wall didactics, websites, educational materials, and digital and social media content to assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals.\n- Curatorial Process: A series of interviews with curators and senior staff to better understand the selection process, exhibition approval workflows, and any frameworks currently guiding exhibition content.\n- Exhibition Planning: A review of current and future exhibitions, with particular attention to those planned for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n- Collection Use: Evaluation of how existing materials and collections are being used or could be used to highlight American achievement and progress, including whether the Smithsonian can make better use of certain materials by digitizing or conveying to other institutions.\n- Narrative Standards: The development of consistent curatorial guidelines that reflect the Smithsonian\u2019s original mission.\nInitially, our review will focus on the following museums. Additional museums will be reviewed in Phase II.\n- National Museum of American History\n- National Museum of Natural History\n- National Museum of African American History and Culture\n- National Museum of the American Indian\n- National Air and Space Museum\n- Smithsonian American Art Museum\n- National Portrait Gallery\n- Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden\nMaterials Request\nTo initiate this process, we respectfully request that each of the museums listed above designate a primary point of contact and provide the following materials to our team (including for online content):\n- 250th Anniversary Programming\n- Exhibition plans, draft concepts, and event outlines related to America 250.\n- Supporting materials such as proposed artwork, descriptive placards, exhibition catalogs, event themes, and lists of invited speakers and events.\n- Current Exhibition Content\n- Catalog and programs for all current and ongoing exhibitions, including budgets.\n- Digital files of all wall didactics, placards, and gallery labels currently on display.\n- Traveling and Upcoming Exhibitions\n- Full index of scheduled traveling exhibitions (2026-2029).\n- Proposals, projected schedules, and preliminary budgets for upcoming exhibitions over the next three years.\n- Internal Guidelines and Governance\n- Curatorial and staff manuals, job descriptions, and organizational charts.\n- Documentation outlining the chain of command for exhibition approvals, scheduling, and content review.\n- Internal communications or memos pertaining to exhibition or artwork selection and approval processes.\n- Index of the Permanent Collection\n- Access to an inventory of all permanent holdings.\n- Educational Materials\n- Teacher guides, student resources, and supplementary educational content linked to current exhibitions.\n- Digital Presence\n- URLs and descriptions of official museum websites and exhibition-related microsites.\n- External Partnerships\n- A list of active partnerships with outside contributors including artists, historians, nonprofits, and advocacy organizations.\n- Grant-Related Documentation\n- Copies of grant applications and funding agreements tied to past or current exhibitions, particularly those that influence content or presentation.\n- Current artists featured in museum\u2019s galleries that received a Smithsonian grant.\n- Surveys and other evaluations of visitor experience\n- Responses to surveys and other forms of evaluating the experience of visitors to the Smithsonian\u2019s museums and users of digital content.\nTimeline\nTo ensure clarity and coordination across all parties involved, we have developed the following implementation timeline:\nWithin 30 days of receipt of this letter, we anticipate:\n- Each museum to submit all requested materials outlined in the first four bullet points above, including current exhibition descriptions, draft plans for upcoming shows, America 250 programming materials, and internal guidelines used in exhibition development.\n- Review of America 250 exhibition and program planning and connect with curators and staff about their specific proposals.\n- A staff liaison from each museum will be designated to serve as the primary point of contact throughout the review process.\n- Our team will begin on-site observational visits, conducting walkthroughs of current exhibitions to document themes, visitor experience, and visual messaging.\nWithin 75 days:\n- Museums are asked to submit the remaining requested documentation (items 5 through 10), including promotional literature, grant data, educational materials, and guided tour content.\n- Our team will begin scheduling and conducting voluntary interviews with curators and senior staff. These conversations will help us better understand each museum\u2019s goals and the broader curatorial vision guiding the institution.\n- Each museum should finalize and submit its updated plan to commemorate America\u2019s 250th anniversary and ensure coordination with the White House Salute to America 250 Task Force to align messaging and public engagement.\nWithin 120 days:\n- Museums should begin implementing content corrections where necessary, replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions across placards, wall didactics, digital displays, and other public-facing materials.\nIf all benchmarks are met on schedule, we anticipate completing our review and preparing a final report for your review in early 2026. This report will include museum-specific assessments, institutional trends, and constructive recommendations for future exhibition strategy.\nWe view this process as a collaborative and forward-looking opportunity\u2014one that empowers museum staff to embrace a revitalized curatorial vision rooted in the strength, breadth, and achievements of the American story. By focusing on Americanism\u2014the people, principles, and progress that define our nation\u2014we can work together to renew the Smithsonian\u2019s role as the world\u2019s leading museum institution.\nWe look forward to working alongside you and your team to ensure these iconic institutions remain vibrant, trusted, and inspiring for generations to come.\nLindsey Halligan\nSpecial Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Staff Secretary\nVince Haley\nAssistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy Council\nRussell Vought\nAssistant to the President and Director of the Office of Management and Budget\nClick here to view the signed letter."

      "text": "Majority Of Voters Oppose Deploying National Guard To D.C., Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Support Drops For U.S. Military Aid To Israel As 50% Think Israel Is Committing Genocide In Gaza\nShare\nIn the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to send National Guard troops to Washington D.C. in an effort to reduce crime, voters 56 - 41 percent oppose the move, according to a Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pea-ack) University national poll of registered voters released today.\nThere are wide partisan and gender differences.\nRepublicans (86 - 12 percent) support the president's decision to deploy the National Guard to the nation's capital to reduce crime, while Democrats (93 - 5 percent) and independents (61 - 34 percent) oppose it.\nMen are split about the president's decision, with 50 percent supporting it and 47 percent opposing it, while women (63 - 33 percent) oppose it.\n\"Posting the National Guard in D.C. to fight local crime gets faint support, with independent voters giving the deployment a big thumbs down,\" said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\nThirty-seven percent of voters approve of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president, while 55 percent disapprove. In Quinnipiac University's July 16 poll, 40 percent of voters approved and 54 percent disapproved.\nIn today's poll, Republicans (84 - 9 percent) approve, while Democrats (98 - 1 percent) and independents (58 - 31 percent) disapprove.\nVoters were asked about Trump's handling of six issues...\n- crime: 42 percent approve, while 54 percent disapprove, with 4 percent not offering an opinion;\n- talks to end the war between Russia and Ukraine: 40 percent approve, while 52 percent disapprove, with 7 percent not offering an opinion;\n- foreign policy: 40 percent approve, while 56 percent disapprove, with 5 percent not offering an opinion;\n- the economy: 39 percent approve, while 57 percent disapprove, with 4 percent not offering an opinion;\n- trade: 38 percent approve, while 56 percent disapprove, with 5 percent not offering an opinion;\n- the Israel - Hamas conflict: 34 percent approve, while 53 percent disapprove, with 12 percent not offering an opinion.\nISRAEL - HAMAS - GAZA\nSix in 10 voters (60 percent) oppose the United States sending more military aid to Israel for their efforts in the war with Hamas, while 32 percent support it.\nThis is the highest level of opposition and lowest level of support for the United States sending more military aid to Israel since Quinnipiac University first asked this question of registered voters on November 2, 2023, in the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.\nIn today's poll, Democrats (75 - 18 percent) and independents (66 - 27 percent) oppose sending more military aid to Israel for their efforts in the war with Hamas, while Republicans (56 - 37 percent) support it.\nVoters were asked whether their sympathies lie more with the Israelis or more with the Palestinians based on what they know about the situation in the Middle East. Thirty-seven percent of voters say the Palestinians, while 36 percent say the Israelis, and 27 percent did not offer an opinion.\nThis is an all-time high for the Palestinians and an all-time low for the Israelis since the Quinnipiac University Poll began asking this question of registered voters in December 2001.\nFifty percent of voters think Israel is committing genocide based on what they know about the situation in Gaza, while 35 percent do not think Israel is committing genocide and 15 percent did not offer an opinion.\nDemocrats (77 - 11 percent) and independents (51 - 34 percent) think Israel is committing genocide, while Republicans (64 - 20 percent) do not think Israel is committing genocide.\n\"Support for the Palestinians grows while the appetite for funding Israel militarily dips sharply. And a harsh assessment of the way Israel is prosecuting the Gaza campaign invokes a word of infamy,\" added Malloy.\nRUSSIA - UKRAINE\nFour in 10 voters (40 percent) are either very confident (15 percent) or somewhat confident (25 percent) that President Trump can broker a permanent peace between Ukraine and Russia, while 59 percent are either not so confident (20 percent) or not confident at all (39 percent).\nVoters 76 - 18 percent do not trust that Russian President Vladimir Putin will stand by any peace agreement to end the war between Russia and Ukraine if one is reached.\nDemocrats (91 - 7 percent), independents (77 - 16 percent), and Republicans (62 - 29 percent) do not trust that Putin will stand by any peace agreement between the two countries if one is reached.\nFifty percent of voters would oppose the U.S. providing ground troops as part of a peacekeeping force in Ukraine if it led to a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, while 40 percent would support it.\nVoters 62 - 29 percent would support the U.S. providing military air support to Ukraine if it led to a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.\nDemocrats (74 - 18 percent), independents (61 - 31 percent), and Republicans (57 - 36 percent) would support the U.S. providing military air support to Ukraine if it led to a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\"Voters have little confidence in President Trump's effort to broker peace in Ukraine, and most voters don't trust Vladimir Putin to keep a peace deal if one were reached. And though the president has ruled out putting U.S. troops in the war theater to keep the peace, four out of 10 voters would support it,\" added Malloy.\nTHE EPSTEIN FILES\nSeven out of 10 voters (70 percent) say they are following news about the Jeffrey Epstein files either very closely (27 percent) or somewhat closely (43 percent), while 28 percent say they are following it not too closely.\nTwo-thirds of voters (67 percent) disapprove of the way the Trump administration is handling the Jeffrey Epstein files, while 19 percent approve and 14 percent did not offer an opinion. This compares to Quinnipiac University's July 16 poll when 63 percent of voters disapproved, 17 percent approved, and 20 percent did not offer an opinion.\nIn today's poll, 44 percent of Republicans approve of the way the Trump administration is handling the Epstein files, while 34 percent disapprove and 22 percent did not offer an opinion.\nDemocrats (92 - 2 percent) and independents (73 - 12 percent) disapprove of the way the Trump administration is handling the Epstein files.\nVoters 73 - 16 percent think the U.S. Justice Department is not being transparent in the way it is handling the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.\nSMITHSONIAN MUSEUMS\nVoters were asked about the Trump administration's plan for a comprehensive internal review of exhibitions at eight of the Smithsonian museums to ensure they comply with President Trump's directives and the need for museums to adjust content that comes into question. Six in 10 voters (60 percent) oppose the review, while 33 percent support it.\nRepublicans (68 - 18 percent) support the review, while Democrats (94 - 5 percent) and independents (66 - 29 percent) oppose the review.\n1,220 self-identified registered voters nationwide were surveyed from August 21st - 25th with a margin of error of +/- 3.4 percentage points, including the design effect.\nThe Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Doug Schwartz, Ph.D. since 1994, conducts independent, non-partisan national and state polls on politics and issues. Surveys adhere to industry best practices and are based on probability-based samples using random digit dialing with live interviewers calling landlines and cell phones.\nVisit poll.qu.edu or www.facebook.com/quinnipiacpoll\nEmail poll@qu.edu or follow us on X @QuinnipiacPoll.\nPoll Questions\n-\nQuestion 1.

      "text": "For Immediate Release\nArlington, VA\u2013Today, the American Alliance of Museums, the only organization representing the entire scope of the museum field, issued a statement in response to the growing threats of censorship against U.S. museums:\nOur country\u2019s 22,000 museums are cornerstones of their communities and are among the most trusted institutions in American life. They tell our nation\u2019s stories from multiple perspectives, welcome people of all ages and backgrounds, contribute billions to the U.S. economy each year, serve communities both rural and urban, and protect the heritage we all share.\nIn recent months, museums have faced increasing external pressures to modify, remove, or limit exhibitions and programs. People trust museums because they rely on independent scholarship and research, uphold high professional standards, and embrace open inquiry. When any directive dictates what should or should not be displayed, it risks narrowing the public\u2019s window into evidence, ideas, and a full range of perspectives.\nThis is not just a concern for select institutions. These pressures can create a chilling effect across the entire museum sector. Freedom of thought and expression are foundational American values, and museums uphold them by creating spaces where people can engage with history, science, art, and culture in ways that are honest, fact-based, and thought-provoking.\nWe stand with the hundreds of thousands of museum professionals in the U.S. who protect our heritage, conserve species, create unforgettable experiences, and serve their communities with integrity. We call on all who value our shared heritage to support the museum field in resisting censorship, so museums can continue to educate, connect, and inspire.\nAmerica needs museums and the professionals who steward them. They educate, connect, and help us understand one another\u2014something we can\u2019t afford to lose.\nAbout the American Alliance of Museums\nThe American Alliance of Museums (AAM) is the only organization representing the entire museum field, from art and history museums to science centers and zoos. Since 1906, we have been championing museums through advocacy and providing museum professionals with the resources, knowledge, inspiration, and connections they need to move the field forward.\n###\nPress Contact:\nNatanya Khashan\nThere is little doubt that museums (alongside libraries and archives) in the U.S. are institutions that are trusted by the public for their honesty, integrity and professional standards. Censorship and its unpleasant impacts erode that trust. As a consequence, public support for and interest in museums progressively declines in a downward spiral.\nAll those of us who work in and for museums internationally have been watching events in the U.S. unfold with increasing concern. I believe that the AAM and the many thousands of museums that it represents can be assured of the support of the international museums sector in these difficult times.\nHi,\nThank you for the strong message. We stand by you and follow the developments in US with great concern. We know that the decline of rights, democracy and plain decency is a world-wide tendency and we see it here too. From several European countries we have reports of serious systematic attacs on freedom of knowledge based work in museums. Our response and advice to museums is to stay united and diversify your revenue and other resources to protect your freedom.\nKind regards\nHenrik Zipsane\nMuseums are the soul of a nation and should not be used or mutilated for the sake of a political agenda."

  "argos_summary": "Former Smithsonian staff and museum advocates warn that President Trump\u2019s proposed overhaul of the Smithsonian\u2019s exhibits risks censorship and undermines the institution\u2019s credibility. Trump\u2019s order calls for removing \u201cdivisive\u201d content and aligning displays with a narrative of American exceptionalism, sparking criticism from curators and the American Alliance of Museums. A poll shows 60% of voters oppose the review, while 40% support it, reflecting deep partisan divides over cultural policy.",
