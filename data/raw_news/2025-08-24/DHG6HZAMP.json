  "description": "Study met primary endpoint (p-value=0.0068) First global phase 3 study to demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements in disease activity across all three subtypes \u2013 MuSK+, LRP4+, triple seronegative Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to be submitted to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by end of 2025 August 25, 2025, 7:00 AM CET Amsterdam, the Netherlands \u2013 argenx SE (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX), a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people sufferi",
  "content": "\u201cThe ADAPT SERON study represents our longstanding commitment to the MG community and our ambition to help all MG patients address this debilitating condition and reach as many MG patients as we can,\u201d said Luc Truyen, M.D. Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, argenx. \u201cThe positive outcome of the ADAPT SERON study clearly shows VYVGART\u2019s ability to provide meaningful benefit across all AChR-ab seronegative gMG subtypes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe results of the ADAPT SERON study, the largest study to date of AChR-Ab seronegative gMG, confirm that VYVGART now has the potential to be a targeted, effective, safe, and necessary treatment for patients living with gMG, regardless of autoantibody status,\u201d said James F. Howard Jr., M.D., Professor of Neurology (Neuromuscular Disease), Medicine and Allied Health, Department of Neurology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and Principal Investigator for the ADAPT SERON trial. \u201cPaired with our existing knowledge, these data demonstrate that pathogenic IgGs are underlying drivers of gMG across patient subtypes. This is a critical advancement in the management of this debilitating and unpredictable disease for patients with limited treatment options.\u201d\n\nVYVGART was well tolerated and safe across AChR-Ab seronegative subtypes and consistent with the established safety profile in patients with AChR-Ab seropositive gMG and other indications. No new safety concerns were identified.\n\nBased on these results, argenx plans to submit an sBLA to the U.S. FDA seeking expansion of the VYVGART label to include adult AChR-Ab seronegative gMG patients across all three subtypes \u2013 MuSK+, LRP4+, triple seronegative. Detailed results from the ADAPT SERON study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.\n\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands \u2013 argenx SE (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX), a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases, today announced positive topline data from the pivotal ADAPT SERON study of VYVGART\u00ae (IV: efgartigimod alfa-fcab). The study met its primary endpoint (p-value=0.0068), demonstrating that AChR-Ab seronegative gMG patients treated with VYVGART achieved a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in MG-ADL (Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living) total score compared to placebo.\n\nThe Phase 3 ADAPT SERON study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod in adults with AChR-Ab seronegative gMG (n=119) across North America, Europe, China, and the Middle East. Part A randomized participants (1:1) received 4 once-weekly infusions of efgartigimod IV or placebo, followed by a 5-week follow-up and primary analysis. Part B was an open-label extension: participants received 2 fixed cycles of 4 once-weekly efgartigimod infusions (4-week interval between cycles); from cycle 3 onward, additional cycles could be started \u22651 week after the last administration of the previous cycle, based on clinical status. The primary endpoint was the MG-ADL total score change from baseline to day 29 in part A. Enrolled participants had a confirmed MG diagnosis by an independent panel of experts, and an MG-ADL total score of 5 or greater. Participants were on a stable dose of at least one gMG treatment prior to randomization, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs. Participants were eligible to enroll in ADAPT SERON if they were AChR-Ab seronegative, which included participants who are MuSK-Ab seropositive, LRP4-Ab seropositive, or triple seronegative.\n\nMG-ADL is a validated measure of disease activity in patients living with myasthenia gravis, which evaluates the functional impact of symptoms on daily activities such as speaking, chewing, swallowing, breathing, and limb strength.\n\ngMG is a rare, chronic, neuromuscular autoimmune disease caused by pathogenic IgGs targeting the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), resulting in impaired neuromuscular transmission and debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness and chronic fatigue. Approx. 80% of patients with gMG have detectable antibodies against the AChR in sera, and these patients are diagnosed as AChR-Ab seropositive gMG. Approximately 20% of patients with gMG do not have detectable serum antibodies directed against AChR and are referred to as AChR-Ab seronegative gMG. These patients may have detectable autoantibodies targeting other NMJ proteins, such as muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4), or others. Anti-MuSK antibodies are detected in approximately 1-10% of patients with gMG, while anti-LRP4 antibodies are detected in approximately 1-5% of patients with gMG. About 10% of patients do not have any detectable autoantibodies against AChR, MuSK or LRP4. These triple seronegative patients have historically been excluded from studies and have a higher disease burden and unmet medical need compared to patients with detectable autoantibodies. Currently, there are no approved treatments available for patients with anti-LRP4 antibodies or for triple seronegative patients.\n\nWhat is VYVGART\u00ae (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)? \n\nVYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis, which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body, in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive). \n\n \n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION \n\nDo not use VYVGART if you have a serious allergy to efgartigimod alfa or any of the other ingredients in VYVGART. VYVGART can cause serious allergic reactions and a decrease in blood pressure leading to fainting. \n\n \n\nVYVGART may cause serious side effects, including:\n\u2022 Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. The most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. Signs or symptoms of an infection may include fever, chills, frequent and/or painful urination, cough, pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, sore throat, excess phlegm, nasal discharge, back pain, and/or chest pain.\n\u2022 Allergic Reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause allergic reactions such as rashes, swelling under the skin, and shortness of breath. Serious allergic reactions, such as trouble breathing and decrease in blood pressure leading to fainting have been reported with VYVGART.\n\u2022 Infusion-Related Reactions. VYVGART can cause infusion-related reactions. The most frequent symptoms and signs reported with VYVGART were high blood pressure, chills, shivering, and chest, abdominal, and back pain. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of an infection, allergic reaction, or infusion-related reaction. These can happen while you are receiving your VYVGART treatment or afterward. Your doctor may need to pause or stop your treatment. Contact your doctor immediately if you have signs or symptoms of a serious allergic reaction. \n\n \n\nBefore taking VYVGART, tell your doctor if you:\n\u2022 take any medicines, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, supplements, or herbal medicines,\n\u2022 have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization), or\n\u2022 have any allergies or medical conditions, including if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the common side effects of VYVGART? \n\nThe most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection, headache, and urinary tract infection.\n\nThese are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.\n\nPlease see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.\n\nThis press release contains inside information within the meaning of Article 7(1) of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation 596/2014).\n\nAbout VYVGART\n\nVYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States, EU, China and Canada for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).\n\nAbout argenx \n\nargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.
