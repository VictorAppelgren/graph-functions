      "feedback": "Strong start, but tighten the causality, sharpen the 3–6 month math, and fix citations. Edits to raise world‑class quality:\n- Core thesis and transmission should be tighter: link policy (Big, Beautiful Bill) and autos tariffs directly to near‑term auto pricing, volumes, and GM/U.S. manufacturing activity, then connect AI/productivity catalysts (Range, Pacaso/mogul) as optional hedges or upside diversifiers rather than broad market darlings. Ground every channel to a numeric delta (price, volumes, margins, capex pace) rather than qualitative gloss.\n- Build a clean, event‑driven 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, timing windows, and invalidations: (a) Trigger window 0–4 weeks: tariff announcements and tariff‑driven pricing chatter; (b) Window 4–8 weeks: tariff implementation details and “pre‑tariff” demand surge signals; (c) Window 8–16 weeks: GM/FCA/GM’s Factory ZERO EV ramp and capex progress (GM cites $4B capex and >2m U.S. annual output; details from WTNT85IPR); (d) Window 12–24 weeks: inflation/rates signal and Deutsche Bank/S&P Global Mobility notes on auto demand; (e) Invalidation cases: tariff escalation beyond stated levels, policy delay/dilution of OB BBA benefits, or a market‑level inflation surprise that breaks the productivity offset thesis.\n- Structure should mirror SECTION FOCUS: base case, 1–2 alts, explicit risks, and watch‑list signals with calibrated confidence. Base case: bill passes with moderate inflation drift and GM/U.S. manufacturing support; Alt 1: tariff price pressure intensifies, but AI‑driven efficiency and private‑market exposures (Range, Pacaso/mogul) re‑price noncore risk assets; Alt 2: policy timing/scale misses, auto demand softens, and the growth impulse from AI productivity is smaller than expected.\n- Increase first‑principles grounding and specificity: quantify debt/deficit channels (range: 2.4–4.0+ trillion debt trajectory depending on bill version; cite Range, Whatley/Whatley‑linked pieces, and German‑style testing notes), and pin auto‑side effects to explicit price/volume/margin sensitivities (tariff pass‑through, demand front‑loading vs. delayed buybacks; GM capex and EV platform ramp; Cadillac Elevated Velocity as signaling, not a near‑term margin engine). Integrate the GM production and Cadillac/V‑Series cues as evidence of a U.S. EV ramp rather than a one‑off showcase.\n- Tighten catalysts, triggers, and invalidations with numbers: tariff pass‑through ranges, peak pre‑tariff demand windows, GM output targets (>2 million/year by 2027–2028 context), and the scale of private/AI platforms (Pacaso/mogul impact on private‑market exposure; Range AI platform affordability and 0% AUM fees as a tilt to high‑net‑worth flows). Reconcile conflicting macro signals by stating a plausible band for each metric and explicitly flagging the source of discord (Range vs. Whatley/CBO‑level totals; Deutsche Bank’s near‑term robustness vs. longer‑horizon weakness).\n- Citation discipline and consistency: anchor every assertion to the IDs WTNT85IPR, EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F (and GM where used), and prune nonessential sources (e.g., tire content) to avoid dilution; avoid listing separate, non‑ID “Pacaso/mogul/Range” tags—cite only the article IDs that contain those specifics (UPV3X2MQ6 for Pacaso/mogul/Range; WTNT85IPR for GM/ Cadillac; EPJYXB7DX for tariff/bill context; ILYC1M41F for Barista FIRE/HeartSciences linkage). Reconcile the three tariff/debt magnitudes (2.4T vs 3.4T vs 4.4T) by presenting a single, transparent range and citing the sources that show each value, then flag which is the official baseline in your scenario.\n- Improve coherence and format fit: replace scattered, paragraph‑long prose with a single tight scenario map in one paragraph that ends with: base case, 1–2 alts, explicit risks, watch‑list signals, and a concise confidence gauge (e.g., moderate). Ensure each sentence links a causal step to a measurable variable and ends with a concrete trigger or data point.\n\nCompact citation set to validate and guide edits: WTNT85IPR, EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, and GM context from WTNT85IPR; avoid non‑ID claims or nonessential sources. This will improve depth, reduce drift, and align the piece squarely with a 3–6 month horizon and a clean base/alt/risk/watch‑list structure.",
