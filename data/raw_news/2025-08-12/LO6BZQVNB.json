  "description": "President Trump said that Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon should \"just focus on being a DJ\" if he does not get a new economist.",
  "content": "FILE PHOTO: DJ D-SOL performs during the 'Safe & Sound' Drive-In Concert Fundraiser Presented by JAJA Tequila and In The Know Experiences In Partnership with Bumble at Nova's Ark Project on July 25, 2020 in Water Mill, New York.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said that Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon should either replace his economist or \"just focus on being a DJ,\" days after the bank's economist warned that American consumers will pay for an increasing share of new tariffs.\n\nTrump's broadside against Solomon \u2014 who moonlights as a DJ \u2014 came as the president touted the revenue being collected by the federal government due to his tariff policies.\n\n\"Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury's coffers,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump then said, \"It has been shown that, for the most part,\" companies and foreign governments are paying for the tariffs, instead of consumers.\n\n\"But David Solomon and Goldman Sachs refuse to give credit where credit is due,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"They made a bad prediction a long time ago on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves, and they were wrong, just like they are wrong about so much else,\" the president wrote.\n\n\"I think that David should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ, and not bother running a major Financial Institution.\"\n\nTrump did not name the economist he wants Solomon to replace.\n\nBut Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist since 2011, warned in a research note on Sunday that American consumers will end up absorbing an increasing share of the cost of Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"Our estimates imply that US consumers had absorbed 22% of tariff costs through June but that their share will likely rise to 67% by October if the later tariffs have the same impact over time as the earliest tariffs,\" Hatzius and other Goldman researchers wrote.",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon says there's an end in sight to the multi-year IPO drought.\n\"It's going to pick up,\" Solomon said on Wednesday, in an on-stage interview with Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins at a summit hosted by the computer networking company in Silicon Valley. \"It's been slow, it's been turned off.\"\nSolomon, who flew to California for the event just after his Wall Street bank reported fourth-quarter results that blew past analysts' estimates, said the capital markets broadly are showing signs of life ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next week.\nThe tech IPO market has largely been dormant since the end of 2021, when tech stocks started falling out of favor due to soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Mergers and acquisitions have been difficult in technology because of hefty regulation that's restricted the ability for the biggest companies to grow through dealmaking.\nSolomon said the mood is changing, and he expects momentum M&A as well as in IPOs.\n\"We have a more constructive kind of optimism, which always helps,\" Solomon said. He later added that, \"broadly speaking, I think it's an improved business environment.\"\nEarlier in the day, Solomon said on his company's earnings call that Trump's election and a swing back to Republican power in Washington is already starting to make an impact in the business world. He noted on the call that \"there is a significant backlog from sponsors and an overall increased appetite for dealmaking supported by an improved regulatory backdrop.\"\nSolomon's comments on the call and at the Cisco event came on a day when the S&P 500 posted his biggest gain since November, helped by a tame inflation report and Goldman's results. Goldman's stock popped 6% on Wednesday.\nWhile the stock market has had a strong two-year run and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit fresh records last month, IPOs have yet to see a resurgence. Cloud software vendor ServiceTitan debuted on the Nasdaq in December, marking the first significant venture-backed IPO in the U.S. since Rubrik in April.\n\"The values came down after 2021, people are growing back into those values,\" Solomon said at the Cisco summit.\nSome companies have said they're ready. Chipmaker Cerebras filed to go public in September, but the process was slowed down due to a review by the Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS. In November, online lender Klarna said it had confidentially filed IPO paperwork with the SEC.\nThough he's bullish about what's coming, Solomon said that there are structural reasons not to go public. He said 25 years ago there were roughly 13,000 public companies in the U.S., and today that number has come down to 3,800. There are higher standards around disclosure for being public, and there's now tons of private capital available \"at scale.\"\n\"It's not fun being a public company,\" Solomon acknowledged. \"Who would want to be a public company?\"\nWATCH: Goldman Sachs tops estimates"

      "text": "Goldman Sachs announced Monday that the company has tapped David Solomon to be the sole president and chief operating officer of the investment banking firm starting April 20th. This move paves his way to succeed Lloyd Blankfein when he retires as CEO as early as the end of this year.\nWhile Solomon, 55, may spend his days negotiating deals and spearheading one of the world's most powerful investment banks, he has a surprising hobby: disc jockeying.\nUnder the moniker \"DJ D-Sol,\" Solomon spins dubstep records at elite clubs all over the world. His Instagram shows that his most recent gig occurred in late January at the trendy New York hotspot Up&Down. Meanwhile, his Fleetwood Mac remix was recently featured on SiriusXM.\nHis disc-jockeying gig has also taken him to the Bahamas where he rang in the New Year. Six months prior, he performed for beach revelers celebrating Independence Day at an outdoor bar called Nipper's. \"Great fun this weekend spinning at Nipper's in Great Guana Cay,\" he wrote on his Instagram. \"Beautiful day and fun crowd celebrating the 4th.\"\nLast September, the financier joined a roster of DJs performing at the MTV Europe Music Awards hosted in London. \"Great night and a great show,\" he wrote on Instagram.\nIn March, he teamed up with SiriusXM DJ and producer Liquid Todd to perform at an outdoor pool party at the ritzy W Hotel in downtown Miami.\nTo show just how seriously he takes his craft, Solomon posted a photo on his Instagram with the caption: \"Starting to play around with vinyl. Old school and lots to learn but very cool.\" These days, most DJs use either laptops or digital turntables.\nThe banker has also been photographed with musicians like rapper Sean Combs and discussed the music business with talent manager and record label owner Scooter Braun at the Goldman Sachs Innovators Summit last fall.\n\"David's always believed that having a wide range of outside interests leads to a balanced life and makes for a better career,\" Goldman spokesman Jake Siewert told The New York Times last year. \"He's preached that regularly to younger employees in the firm and tries to lead by example.\"\nThough it's unclear whether Solomon is paid for his musical performances, he's probably not in it for the money. According to career site Payscale, the average DJ makes roughly $40 an hour.\nIn comparison, Solomon currently receives an annual salary of $1.85 million and annual variable pay, according to Fortune, and filings show he received $10 million worth of restricted stock in early January.\nLike this story?
