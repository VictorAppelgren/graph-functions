  "description": "Letby scrawled notes such as \u2018I am evil, I did this\u2019, which prosecuting lawyers argued amounted to a confession",
  "content": "A bombshell new documentary on child killer Lucy Letby will offer a new explanation behind a number of scribbled notes written by the nurse which were used as evidence to convict her.\n\nBritain\u2019s most prolific child serial killer is currently serving 15 whole-life sentences for seven murders and seven attempted murders of babies while working at the Countess of Chester Hospital.\n\nNotes such as \u201cI am evil, I did this\u201d were scrawled on a scrappy notepad found in her house, which also read: \u201cI killed them on purpose because I am not good enough to care for them and I am a horrible evil person.\u201d\n\n\u201cHate\u201d was also written in block capitals with heavy ink and circled, while the note is headed: \u201cNot good enough.\u201d But the notes also included other phrases such as: \"I haven't done anything wrong\" and \"we tried our best and it wasn't enough\"\n\nThe NHS neonatal nurse is currently serving 15 whole life sentences for seven murders and seven attempted murders of babies while working at the Countess of Chester Hospital.\n\nAccording to The Times, a new ITV documentary will put forward a new explanation for the notes, which were presented by the prosecution as amounting to a confession - despite some of the notes appearing to deny her guilt.\n\nDawn is a childhood friend of Letby with whom she studied her A-Levels at Aylestone School in Hereford. The 35-year-old, who did not want her last name to be published, said the pair were taught while in school to write down their most dark thoughts during \u201cpeer-support training sessions\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Lucy Letby: Beyond Reasonable Doubt? documentary, she said: \u201cAt all of those training sessions, it was recommended to us that, you know, if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, you write down everything that\u2019s going through your mind that is, you know, troubling you.\n\n\u201cSo, all of the dark thoughts, all of those inner voices that you can\u2019t silence. You just write it all down on a piece of paper to get it off your mind.\u201d\n\nLetby has lost two attempts to challenge her convictions at the Court of Appeal so far, but questions are growing about the safety of Letby\u2019s convictions after multiple experts have cast doubts over some of the evidence used in the trial in August 2023.\n\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) is reviewing an application by Letby\u2019s legal team, which includes a 300-page report from chemical engineer Helen Shannon and professor Geoff Chase, who refute claims made by the prosecution that Letby \u201cundoubtedly\u201d poisoned two babies by spiking their feeding bags with insulin.\n\nMs Shannon and Prof Chase, who were given access to the babies\u2019 medical notes, say they could have been born with specific types of antibodies in their blood which can cause a high reading of insulin.\n\nSpeaking to the documentary, Ms Shannon said according to The Times: \u201cWhat was presented in court as this is smoking-gun evidence of poisoning actually looks pretty typical for a pre-term neonate.\n\n\u201cAnd we can\u2019t see any justification whatsoever for the prosecution statement that it could only be poisoning.\u201d\n\nDawn also tells the documentary about the moment Letby was found guilty: \u201cI think I was at work when I heard that they were, sort of, returning the verdict, and sort of tuned in and I think I just sat there dumbfounded for a while, not really knowing how to process what I was hearing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was real. I immediately switched to thinking: \u2018Well, what\u2019s next, you know? What happens next? This can\u2019t be it. She can\u2019t just spend the rest of her life in prison\u2019.\u201d",

      "text": "\u2018I\u2019m innocent\u2019 says Letby after further whole-life order for baby murder bid\nLast August, the serial killer nurse was convicted by another jury of the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of six others.\nChild serial killer Lucy Letby said \u201cI\u2019m innocent\u201d as she was led from court after being sentenced to an additional whole-life order for the attempted murder of a baby girl.\nEarlier this week, the 34-year-old former nurse was found guilty at Manchester Crown Court of the attack on the newborn infant during a night shift in the Countess of Chester Hospital\u2019s neonatal unit in February 2016.\nLast August, she was convicted at the same court by another jury of the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of six others, with two attempts on one child.\nShe is already serving 14 whole-life orders for each of those offences committed on the unit between June 2015 and June 2016.\nOn Friday, Mr Justice Goss imposed a 15th whole-life order on Letby and repeated to her that she will spend the rest of her in prison.\nHe then told dock officers to take her down and, as she was led away, she turned round and said: \u201cI\u2019m innocent.\u201d\nA retrial was ordered on a single allegation concerning the baby girl, known as Child K, after the first jury was unable to reach a verdict but a second jury took just three-and-a-half hours to convict Letby.\nLetby, of Hereford, targeted the \u201cvery premature\u201d baby after she was moved from the delivery room to the unit\u2019s intensive care unit in the early hours of February 17.\nAbout 90 minutes after the little girl\u2019s birth, Letby dislodged the breathing tube through which she was being ventilated with air and oxygen.\nConsultant paediatrician Dr Ravi Jayaram caught her \u201cvirtually red-handed\u201d as he entered Nursery 1 at about 3.45am and he then went on to intervene and resuscitate Child K.\nDr Jayaram told jurors he saw \u201cno evidence\u201d that she had done anything to help the deteriorating baby as he walked in and saw her standing next to the infant\u2019s incubator.\nHe said he heard no call for help from Letby or alarms sounding as Child K\u2019s blood oxygen levels dropped.\nFrom the witness box, Letby told the jury of six women and six men that she had no recollection of the event described by Dr Jayaram and did not accept it had taken place.\nChild K was transferred, as planned, to a specialist hospital later on February 17 because of her extreme prematurity and died there three days later.\nThe judge said that despite Child K\u2019s fragility, her condition at the Countess of Chester was \u201cgood\u201d and she was stable on a ventilator before Letby targeted her in the knowledge that a transfer was due to take place.\nHe told Letby: \u201cI repeat what I have said before, only you know the reason or reasons for your murderous campaign.\n\u201cIt was another shocking act of calculated, callous cruelty.\n\u201cShe (Child K) was exceptionally vulnerable and in a place where others were striving to provide her with dedicated medical and nursing care.\n\u201cYou betrayed the trust of (Child K), her parents and all those working at the hospital. You caused her physical suffering and added psychological suffering to her family.\n\u201cDuring the course of this trial, as you did in the last trial, you have coldly denied any responsibility for any of your wrongdoing and sought to attribute fault to others. You have no remorse.\u201d\nChild K\u2019s mother read a victim personal statement on behalf of herself and her husband from the witness box.\nShe said: \u201c(Child K) is not here. Never will be. We will never have what would give us peace, closure, or a feeling of being a complete family unit.\n\u201cHowever, you Lucy Letby will never hurt another child or have the privilege and joy that children give.\n\u201cOur time and effort that you have absorbed over the years will stop today and our focus will remain on our beautiful children and building the most exciting and love-filled life that we possibly can.\u201d\nLetby was tearful at times as Child K\u2019s mother outlined the impact on the couple\u2019s life.\nBen Myers KC, defending, said: \u201cWe recognise and acknowledge the sympathy for (Child K\u2019s) family and the grave view taken of this conviction.\n\u201cMiss Letby\u2019s position remains she is not guilty of any offence.\u201d\nMr Justice Goss ordered that five other counts of attempted murder \u2013 involving four children \u2013 to lie on file after the first jury could not reach verdicts on those counts.\nFollowing sentence, Senior Crown Prosecutor Nicola Wyn Williams, of the Crown Prosecution Service Mersey Cheshire, said: \u201cThe savagery of her actions has been difficult for the prosecution team to comprehend and has devastated the lives of the families of these babies.\n\u201cWe still have no idea why she committed these crimes but the Crown Prosecution Service does not have to prove a motive. We simply need to prove that the defendant committed the crime.\u201d\nIn May, Letby lost her Court of Appeal bid to challenge her convictions from last year.\nA court order prohibits reporting of the identities of the surviving and dead children involved in the case."

  "argos_summary": "A new ITV documentary on Lucy Letby, Britain's most prolific child serial killer, will explore the context behind her controversial notes, which were used as evidence in her conviction for murdering seven babies. The notes, which include conflicting statements about her guilt, may reflect a peer-support exercise rather than a confession. Experts are now questioning the evidence presented in her trial, particularly regarding claims of poisoning, as the Criminal Cases Review Commission reviews her case following two failed appeals. Letby continues to maintain her innocence despite being sentenced to 15 whole-life orders.",
