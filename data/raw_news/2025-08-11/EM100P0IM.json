  "content": "Boar's Head plans to reopen the Jarratt, Virginia, facility at the center of a deadly Listeria outbreak last year despite federal inspections continuing to find sanitation violations at three of the food company's other facilities, according to federal records obtained by the Associated Press.\n\nThe AP obtained 35 pages of inspection reports via a Freedom of Information Act Request. Those reports cover inspections between January 1 and July 23 at three other Boar's Head facilities: Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia. Overall, the reports reveal a suite of violations, including mold, condensation dripping over food areas, overflowing trash, meat and fat residue built up on walls and equipment, drains blocked with meat scraps, and pooling meat juice. The reports also recorded staff who didn't wear the proper protective hairnets and aprons\u2014and didn't wash their hands.\n\nIn one violation, reported in the Petersburg facility, inspectors found meat waste collecting under equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"\n\nThe problems echo the sanitation violations recorded at the Jarratt plant before contamination with Listeria\u2014particularly linked to the company's liverwurst\u2014caused an outbreak that led officials to shut it down. That outbreak spanned July to November of last year and sickened 61 people across 19 states, hospitalizing 60 and killing 10. Inspection reports revealed problems with mold, water leaks, dirty equipment and rooms, meat debris stuck on walls and equipment, various bugs, and, at one point, puddles of blood on the floor.\n\nAmid the outbreak response, Boar's Head vowed to make big changes to improve its food safety systems. Those included setting up a panel of food safety advisers, which included Frank Yiannas, a former Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, who served as Trump\u2019s US Department of Agriculture undersecretary for food safety in his first term and has been nominated for the position again in his second.",

      "text": "Boar\u2019s Head plans to reopen troubled deli meat plant, but reports of sanitation problems persist\nBoar\u2019s Head plans to reopen troubled deli meat plant, but reports of sanitation problems persist\nThe Boar\u2019s Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year\u2019s deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.\nBut recent inspections at Boar\u2019s Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.\nThe Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \u201cfailed to maintain sanitary conditions.\u201d Boar\u2019s Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.\nUSDA officials this week said they had \u201cthoroughly reviewed\u201d the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.\n\u201cThe facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\u201d officials with the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.\nAnd yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar\u2019s Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.\nIn the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn\u2019t wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.\nThe records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company\u2019s promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.\n\u201cIf there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\u201d said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.\nJobs posted in Virginia\nOfficials at Boar\u2019s Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.\nThe company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for USDA\u2019s undersecretary for food safety.\nBoar\u2019s Head last year said they \u201cregret and deeply apologize\u201d for the contamination and that \u201ccomprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\u201d\nHave a news tip?\nContact AP\u2019s global investigative team at [email protected]. For secure and confidential communications, use the free Signal app +1 (202) 281-8604.\nBut company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination\u2019s cause.\nBrashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar\u2019s Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company\u2019s food safety board.\n\u201cBoar\u2019s Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\u201d described on the company\u2019s website, Boar\u2019s Head said in an emailed statement.\n\u201cWe have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\u201d the statement said.\nInadequate sanitation practices\nThe 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar\u2019s Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.\nThey surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.\n\u201cYou would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.\nRep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \u201cappalling.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company\u2019s bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\u201d the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.\nThe findings echo the \u201cinadequate sanitation practices\u201d that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.\nAt the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.\nWhile no instances of insects were documented in this year\u2019s inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \u201cdried fat and protein from the previous day\u2019s production\u201d on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \u201c5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\u201d\nOther reports detailed beaded condensation \u201cdirectly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\u201d Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.\nThe reports point to a \u201cfood safety culture problem,\u201d said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.\n\u201cWhat jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\u201d she said. \u201cUsually that culture has to start at the top.\u201d\nIn the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.\n\u201cI think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\u201d Kowalcyk said.\nBoar\u2019s Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

      "text": "A 10th person has died in the nationwide Listeria outbreak connected to Boar's Head deli meats, which otherwise appears to be slowing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.\nIn an update about the outbreak on Wednesday, the CDC said that since its last update on August 28, only two new cases have been identified, bringing the outbreak's current total to 59 cases in 19 states. All 59 cases were hospitalized. One new death was reported in New York, bringing the total deaths to 10.\nIn an alert to the media, the agency noted that \"Illness reports have started to decrease, and CDC will update this notice less frequently.\" However, the risk of more life-threatening infections is not yet over.\nThe outbreak, which began in late May, led to the discovery of the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes in unopened packages of Boar's Head liverwurst. That spurred a recall of more than 7 million pounds of Boar's Head meats in July and the indefinite closure of the company's Jarratt, Virginia plant, which had a shocking history of sanitation and manufacturing violations throughout the facility and its production lines. Violations included meat build-up on walls and equipment, filth and numerous water leaks throughout the building, mold, algae, insects, and even puddles of blood. In 2022, the plant was deemed an \"imminent threat\" to public health by US inspectors."

      "text": "Key points\nThis outbreak is over. Even when there are no ongoing Listeria outbreaks, women who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system should avoid deli meat or reheat it to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F or until steaming hot to kill any germs.\nLatest update\nNovember 21, 2024\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) collected different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections.\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback data showed that meats sliced at deli counters, including Boar's Head brand liverwurst, were contaminated with Listeria and made people sick.\nEpidemiologic data\nSince the last update on September 25, two more illnesses were reported. As of November 19, a total of 61 people infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria were reported from 19 states. Sick people's samples were collected from May 29, 2024, to September 13, 2024. Of 61 people with information available, 60 were hospitalized. One woman got sick during her pregnancy and remained pregnant after recovering. Ten deaths were reported, including one in Illinois, one in New Jersey, two in New York, one in Virginia, one in Florida, one in Tennessee, one in New Mexico, and two in South Carolina.\nThe true number of sick people in this outbreak was likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not have been limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for Listeria. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.\nPublic health officials collect many different types of information from sick people, including their age, race, ethnicity, other demographics, and the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. This information provides clues to help investigators identify the source of the outbreak.\nThe list below has information about sick people in this outbreak (\u201cn\u201d is the number of people with information available for each demographic).\n- Age (n=61): Range from 32 to 95 years, Median of 78\n- Sex (n=61): 49% female, 51% male\n- Race (n=56): 78% White, 16% African American/Black, 3% Asian, 3% Other\n- Ethnicity (n=52): 94% non-Hispanic, 6% Hispanic\nState and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. People reported eating a variety of meats sliced at deli counters. Of the 48 people able to be interviewed, 45 (94%) reported eating deli meats. Forty-three of the 45 (96%) reported eating meats sliced at a deli. Of the 44 people who answered if they ate liverwurst, 27 (61%) reported deli-sliced liverwurst before getting sick and 20 specifically reported Boar's Head brand. These deli meats were sliced at a variety of supermarket and grocery store delis.\nPublic health actions\nThis outbreak is over. CDC always advises women who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system, to avoid eating deli meats or to heat them before consuming.\nIn July 2024, Boar's Head issued a recall of all deli products made at their Jarratt, VA facility, which included prepackaged deli products and ready-to-eat liverwurst products, due to being contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. These products are past shelf-life.\nPrevious updates\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections.\nEpidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback data continue to show that meats sliced at deli counters, including Boar's Head brand liverwurst, were contaminated with Listeria and made people sick.\nEpidemiologic data\nSince the last update on August 28, two more illnesses and one more death have been reported.

Of the 33 people who answered if they ate liverwurst, 18 (55%) reported deli-sliced liverwurst before getting sick, and 13 reported Boar's Head brand. These deli meats were sliced at a variety of supermarket and grocery store delis.\nLaboratory and traceback data\nThe Maryland Department of Health and Baltimore City Health Department collected an unopened Boar's Head liverwurst product from a retail store and identified Listeria monocytogenes. Additionally, the New York State Food Laboratory identified Listeria monocytogenes from a previously collected sample of unopened Boar's Head liverwurst products collected by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets' Division of Food Safety and Inspection from retail stores. WGS determined both to be the same strain as the strain making people sick in this outbreak.\nUSDA-FSIS conducted traceback of deli meats purchased by sick people in this outbreak to identify producers of interest for further investigation.\nPublic health actions\nCDC advises people to not eat recalled deli meat products. CDC also advises women who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system to avoid eating deli meats or to heat them before consuming.\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections.\nEpidemiologic and laboratory data now show that meats sliced at deli counters, including Boar's Head brand liverwurst, are contaminated with Listeria and are making people sick.\nEpidemiologic data\nAs of July 26, 2024, a total of 34 people infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria have been reported from 13 states (see map). Sick people's samples were collected from May 29, 2024, to July 12, 2024 (see timeline). Of 33 people with information available, all 33 have been hospitalized. One woman got sick during her pregnancy and remained pregnant after recovering. Two deaths have been reported, 1 in Illinois and 1 in New Jersey.\nThe true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for Listeria. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.\nPublic health officials collect many different types of information from sick people, including their age, race, ethnicity, other demographics, and the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. This information provides clues to help investigators identify the source of the outbreak.\nThe list below has information about sick people in this outbreak (\"n\" is the number of people with information available for each demographic)\n- Age (n=34): Range from 32 to 94 years, Median of 74\n- Sex (n=34): 44% female, 56% male\n- Race (n=31): 78% White, 19% African American/Black, 3% Asian\n- Ethnicity (n=29): 97% non-Hispanic, 3% Hispanic\nState and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. People are reporting eating a variety of meats sliced at deli counters. Of the 24 people able to be interviewed, 23 (96%) reported eating meats sliced at a deli. Of the 23 people who answered if they ate liverwurst, 13 (57%) reported deli-sliced liverwurst before getting sick, and seven reported Boar's Head brand. These deli meats were sliced at a variety of supermarket and grocery store delis.\nCDC conducted an analysis comparing foods reported by people in this outbreak to foods reported by people who got sick with Listeria but were not part of an outbreak. The analysis showed that people in this outbreak were significantly more likely to eat liverwurst. This information suggests that liverwurst is a likely source of this outbreak. CDC continues to gather information to understand which deli meats are causing illness in this outbreak.\nLaboratory and traceback data\nThe Maryland Department of Health and Baltimore City Health Department collected an unopened Boar's Head liverwurst product from a retail store and identified Listeria monocytogenes. WGS determined it is the same strain as the strain making people sick in this outbreak.\nUSDA-FSIS conducted traceback of deli meats purchased by sick people in this outbreak to identify producers of interest for further investigation.\nPublic health actions\nOn July 30, Boar\u2019s Head expanded their July 26 recall. Do not eat recalled deli meat products. CDC also advises women who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system to avoid eating deli meats or to heat them before consuming.\nCDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections.\nEpidemiologic information shows that many people in this outbreak report eating meats sliced at deli counters. We do not have information to show that people are getting sick from prepackaged deli meats.\nEpidemiologic data\nAs of July 26, 2024, a total of 34 people infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria have been reported from 13 states (see map).

People are reporting eating a variety of meats sliced at deli counters. Of the 18 people able to be interviewed, 16 (89%) reported eating meats sliced at a deli, most commonly deli-sliced turkey, liverwurst, and ham. Meats were sliced at a variety of supermarket and grocery store delis.\nCDC conducted an analysis comparing foods reported by people in this outbreak to foods reported by people who got sick with Listeria but were not part of an outbreak. The analysis showed that people in this outbreak were more likely to eat deli-sliced turkey and liverwurst. This information suggests that meats sliced at the deli are a likely source of this outbreak. However, at this time CDC doesn't have enough information to say which deli meats are the source of this outbreak.\nLaboratory and traceback data\nPublic health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS).WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak may have gotten sick from eating this food.\nUSDA-FSIS is working to identify the suppliers of deli meats, sliced at deli counters, purchased by people in this outbreak.\nPublic health actions\nCDC advises women who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system to contact their healthcare provider if they have any Listeria symptoms. Additionally, CDC advises people to take steps to protect themselves from getting Listeria from deli meats by avoiding eating meats sliced at the deli unless they are heated before eating."

      "text": "The Boar's Head deli-meat plant at the epicenter of a nationwide Listeria outbreak that killed nine people so far harbored the deadly germ in a common area of the facility deemed \"low risk\" for Listeria. Further, it had no written plans to prevent cross-contamination of the dangerous bacteria to other products and areas. That's according to a federal document newly released by Boar's Head.\nOn Friday, the company announced that it is indefinitely closing that Jarratt, Virginia-based plant and will never again produce liverwurst\u2014the product that Maryland health investigators first identified as the source of the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes. The finding led to the recall of more than 7 million pounds of Boar's Head meat. The Jarratt plant, where the company's liverwurst is made, has been shuttered since late July amid the investigation into how the outbreak occurred.\nIn the September 13 update, Boar's Head explained that \"our investigation has identified the root cause of the contamination as a specific production process that only existed at the Jarratt facility and was used only for liverwurst. With this discovery, we have decided to permanently discontinue liverwurst.\"\nWhile the statement seems to offer some closure on the outbreak's source, previously released inspection reports described a facility riddled with sanitation failures. Between August 1, 2023, and August 2, 2024, the facility was cited for 69 violations, which included water leaks, mold in numerous places, algal growth, \"meat buildup\" caking equipment, and walls that were also crawling with flies and gnats, sightings of other insects, rancid smells, trash and debris on the floors, and even \"ample amounts of blood in puddles.\"\nThe New York Times also reported that a 2022 inspection found that the plant posed an \"imminent threat\" to public health and that inspectors cited \"extensive rust, deli meats exposed to wet ceilings, green mold and holes in the walls.\"\nCross-contamination\nThe document newly released by Boar's Head is a letter dated July 31 from the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service notifying the company that the Jarratt facility was suspended. The basis of the suspension was an inspection finding from July 24 and 25 of L. monocytogenes contaminating a pallet jack in a large room where ready-to-eat meats were processed. The room was a common area not specific to liverwurst processing and was deemed by Boar's Head to be \"low risk\" for Listeria."

  "argos_summary": "Boar's Head plans to reopen its Jarratt, Virginia facility, which was previously linked to a deadly Listeria outbreak that resulted in 10 deaths and 61 illnesses. Despite this, recent inspections at other Boar's Head facilities revealed ongoing sanitation violations, including mold, meat residue, and improper staff hygiene practices. Critics express concern over the company's commitment to food safety, as similar issues were noted prior to the outbreak, raising questions about the effectiveness of the measures Boar's Head claims to have implemented.",
