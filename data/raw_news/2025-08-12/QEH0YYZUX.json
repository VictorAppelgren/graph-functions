  "content": "An Israeli nongovernmental organization is working behind the scenes to provide a critical link between the Israeli military and international organizations with one goal in mind: Get humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians.\n\n\"We really became this informal connector and facilitator between the Israeli authorities and the humanitarian community,\" IsraAID CEO Yotam Polizer said.\n\nIsraAID has worked in 64 countries and is currently the largest humanitarian organization based out of Israel.\n\nUNICEF OFFICIAL SAYS GAZA MALNUTRITION REACHES 'FAMINE LEVELS' AS HUMANITARIAN AID TRICKLES IN\n\nPolizer says there is broad consensus now that a concerning humanitarian level was reached in Gaza with pockets of malnutrition across the strip. He notes that it isn\u2019t only food that is needed by the civilian population, but also medicine, water and nutritional provisions.\n\n\"When we reach severe malnutrition levels, we know that just rice and flour is not going to solve the problem,\" Polizer added. \"We need nutritional supplements, we need people to get protein.\"\n\nFor nearly five months, there was no consistent flow of aid. That has changed in recent weeks with thousands of trucks being distributed along with airdrops of supplies to civilians. Recently, the entry of commercial trucks was partially approved.\n\n\"The declared policy of Israel for two and a half months after the ceasefire collapsed was that nothing comes in,\" Polizer said. \"That was the policy because the plan was to pressure Hamas.\"\n\nThe IsraAID CEO says the focus must be on saving lives, not on playing the \"blame game.\" He urges the United Nations, the Israel Defense Forces, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and all humanitarian organizations to work together and find solutions.\n\n\"As a humanitarian organization, the concept of \u2018do no harm\u2019 is really our Bible,\" Polizer added.\n\nA few months after the war started, IsraAID started to receive requests from global humanitarian organizations they had worked with in Afghanistan and Ukraine, asking for help to facilitate aid deliveries to Gaza.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThese groups had issues with customs clearance and approval from the Israeli military to deliver supplies to Palestinians in Gaza. These were problems IsraAID could help solve.\n\nDespite the political and cultural differences, Polizer said the Jewish community of the United States is stepping up to donate and support finding solutions for the hunger crisis in Gaza.\n\n\"You can support the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, but it does not mean you are anti-Israel,\" he concluded.",

      "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his security cabinet's plan to take over Gaza is more expansive than previously announced, arguing on Monday that Israel \"has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.\"\nNetanyahu's office originally announced the takeover on Friday, but he now says the operations will include not only Gaza City but also in the \"central camps\" and Muwasi. The latter areas are home to well over 500,000 people. The Israeli prime minister says he has spoken with President Donald Trump about the plan and says he thanked him for America's \"steadfast support.\"\n\"Our goal is not to occupy Gaza, our goal is to free Gaza,\" Netanyahu said Monday. His office says the goals behind the takeover are to fully root out Hamas everywhere in Gaza before stabilizing the region and eventually handing leadership off to friendly Arab forces opposed to Hamas.\nThe Security Cabinet's Friday announcement said it adopted, by vote, five principles for concluding the war which include: the disarming of Hamas, the return of all hostages \u2013 living and deceased \u2013 the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip, Israeli security control in the Gaza Strip, and the establishment of an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.\nISRAEL SECURITY CABINET APPROVES PLAN TO OCCUPY GAZA CITY\nThe plan gives the green light to Defense Minister Israel Katz to call up over 400,000 military reservists to carry out the operation until November 30.\nNews of the operation comes as many of Israel's longtime allies have announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state. France announced such willingness earlier this year, while the United Kingdom and Canada followed over the past two weeks. Australia was the latest country to do so on Sunday.\nRECOGNIZING A PALESTINIAN STATE NOW WILL COMPLICATE FUTURE PEACE EFFORTS, EXPERTS WARN\n\"Australia will recognize the right of the Palestinian people to a state of their own, predicated on the commitments Australia has received from the Palestinian Authority,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, referring to the governing entity of the Palestinian areas of the West Bank.\nThose commitments, he said, included the demilitarization of Gaza and the holding of elections \u2013 with no role for Hamas in a Palestinian government. Australia has designated Hamas a terrorist entity and Albanese repeated Monday his government's calls for the group to return Israeli hostages held since the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre.\n\"A two-state solution is humanity\u2019s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,\" Albanese said.\nCANADA PLANS TO RECOGNIZE PALESTINIAN STATE IN SEPTEMBER, PM CARNEY SAYS\nThe prime minister said the situation there \"has gone beyond the world\u2019s worst fears.\" He accused the Israeli government of continuing \"to defy international law and deny sufficient aid, food and water to desperate people, including children.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has continued to defend Israel against accusations of genocide at the United Nations. Other rival nations on the U.N. Security Council have been all too willing to criticize Israel, however, with China condemning the situation in Gaza as alleged \"collective punishment,\" and Russia calling it a \"reckless intensification of hostilities\" at a security meeting on Sunday.\nFox News' Bradford Betz and the Associated Press contributed to this report"

      "text": "The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews swiftly mobilized its resources in July to aid persecuted Syrian Druze and Christians facing what some have called a genocide carried out by jihadists in southern Syria.\nSyrian-backed forces, including jihadist fighters, launched attacks against Syrian Druze in the southern part of the country, resulting in the murders of at least 1,400 people, including a 35-year-old Syrian American from Oklahoma, Hosam Saraya, who was visiting family in Syria.\n\"Once we saw what was happening in Sweida, we could not turn a blind eye to it.\" International Fellowship of Christians and Jews President and Global CEO Yael Eckstein told Fox News Digital.\nHer organization, she noted, had never operated in Syria prior to this year but said her organization \"got an urgent call from a hospital from Sweida, and they needed basic medicines, surgical care, ICU medicine and equipment, first responder equipment and masks for morgue workers.\"\nThe Fellowship coordinated with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to deliver medicine and equipment to Sweida. Eckstein said her group supplied \"retired Israeli ambulances to Syria so the locals can operate them.\"\nThe majority Druze city of Sweida was a focal point of the siege executed by Syrian Islamists loyal to new President Ahmed Al-Sharaa, a former member of U.S.-designated terrorist movements, al Qaeda and the Islamic State.\nAccording to Christian Broadcasting Network, Christians were also targeted. Islamists reportedly murdered Khaled Mazhar, pastor of the Good Shepherd Evangelical Church in Sweida, along with 11 family members. An additional person survived the massacre of Christians because the Islamists thought she was dead.\nIn July, Israel launched military strikes against the largely Bedouin forces on their way to the southern city of Sweida to stop the massacre. Israel also attacked the Syrian Defense headquarters in Damascus to halt the bloodshed in Sweida. Eckstein added that at least \"26 Druze villages were fully burned.\"\nSince Fox News Digital\u2019s interview with Eckstein, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported at \"least 30 villages were damaged by arson and destruction.\"\nEckstein said the Fellowship first provided aid in Syria in April when Druze in Syria were targeted and killed.\n\"When we provided 1.500 food boxes to the Druze within 13 kilometers of Israel\u2019s borders after the massacre in April, two days later Islamists burned boxes of the Fellowship,\" Eckstein sid.\nIsrael and Syria do not have diplomatic relations. Syria is considered an enemy state because it has launched multiple wars against Israel since the rebirth of the Jewish state in 1948.\nEckstein said the Fellowship is \"operating in enemy territory, and Jews and Christians are providing life-saving aid. Islamists don\u2019t like it. We would like to see that it is in the Syrian government\u2019s interests to receive aid and hope that more goodness will be brought to Syria.\n\"Now, Jewish people are standing with Christians who are being persecuted in Syria. It is really important to highlight that this is a case of good versus evil and is not just limited to Syria. It is important for Jews and Christians to stand together regarding Judeo-Christian values that sanctify life.\"\nTRUMP SIGNS ORDER LIFTING SANCTIONS ON SYRIA\nSafwan Marich of the Israeli Druze community runs the Fellowship\u2019s Emergency Response Center and told Fox News Digital that, in the Sweida region, \"tyhere is a genocide going on. This needs no further explanation, especially for the Jewish people.\n\"Once the residents of the deserted village come back, they will understand the magnitude of disaster. Women were kidnapped by jihads, and children were kidnapped and missing.\"\nMarich has been in contact with his fellow Druze in Syria.\n\"This war is religious in essence,\" he said. \"There is a video of Daesh [Islamic State] going to one of the villages asking, \u2018Are you a Druze or Sunni?' And he answered that he is Syrian. He asked him again, so he answered Druze, and he was shot in the middle of the street. It is obvious there is a religious motivation behind this event.\n\"It is important for me to help the Druze because, first and foremost, I am a Druze. The Druze people are not aggressive and hostile, but they will not sit idly by when they are attacked. We have in the Druze tradition a commandment to help our brothers. To come to aid of Druze community wherever it might be in the world.\nMarich also noted he is Israeli, and the other day a Druze officer was killed in Gaza. Twelve officers from the Druze community have been killed in Gaza since the war began.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"They died defending Israel and the Jewish people. We have an expectation that Israeli society will come through and stand by Druze community, and so we can defend our brothers in Syria. The state of Israel cannot afford to have Daesh on its borders and in the Golan Heights.\"\nHe pointed to the example of Hamas on the border and its growth as a military danger over the years as a warning about radical Islamists gaining a foothold on the Syrian-Israeli border."

      "text": "Malnutrition levels inside the Gaza Strip have reached famine levels as aid starts to trickle in, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Ted Chaiban told Fox News.\n\"The situation is catastrophic on the ground in Gaza.\" Chaiban said. \"After 22 months of war, two months of a blockade by Israel, people are in a horrendous state.\"\nNewly released data shows that a quarter of Gaza\u2019s population, nearly 500,000 people, are enduring famine-like conditions.\nBERNIE SANDERS TO FORCE SENATE VOTE ON BLOCKING ARMS SALE TO ISRAEL\nUNICEF is working with the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization to distribute food and nutrition supplements to Palestinian civilians, but Chaiban cautions that commercial access to Gaza is necessary to resolve the hunger crisis.\n\"On our own, we won\u2019t be able to address the needs of two million people,\" Chaiban added.\nRight now, UNICEF has three key requests from the Israeli government and military that must approve all entry of aid to Gaza.\nUNICEF is requesting that their efforts be complemented by commercial traffic, dual-use issues of things like water pipes be resolved, and more partners be allowed to operate inside the enclave.\nHumanitarian efforts have ramped up in recent days, with hundreds of trucks being permitted to distribute aid inside Gaza, coupled with airdrops of pallets by Jordan and the UAE. Currently, around 100 trucks a day are driving aid to central kitchens and warehouses. The United Nations aims to have 400 to 500 trucks a day working to address immediate humanitarian concerns.\n\"What is needed is to build on the opportunity and the opening of the humanitarian pause,\" Chaiban said. \"To send that aid in through all channels and all routes in order that it can reach the population.\"\nThe UNICEF Deputy returned from a visit to Gaza this week. While there, he saw emaciated civilians walking around, empty markets and young children suffering from malnutrition. He believed that an end to the war is the only sustainable solution to address the expanding crisis.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Most importantly is to reach a ceasefire and the release of hostages which should not be held in the Gaza Strip, so that there is relief on a more sustainable basis to the people in Gaza that have gone through a horrendous situation,\" Chaiban concluded."

      "text": "What to know about the State of Israel\nIsrael is a country in the Middle East predominantly composed of Jewish individuals. It is home to many holy sites and has deep religious roots dating back to biblical times. Bordered by Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, Israel is roughly the size of New Jersey.\nBenjamin Netanyahu, from the right-wing Likud party, is the longest-serving prime minister of Israel. He previously served as prime minister from 1996 to 1999 and later from 2009 to 2021, before returning to the role in 2022.\nThe State of Israel was established in 1948 and was officially admitted to the United Nations (UN) in 1949. Israel has a long-standing conflict with Arab states and the Palestinians, characterized by years of violence and terrorist attacks against the Jewish state.\nOn Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a deadly attack on Israel, prompting Israel to formally declare war on Hamas. In June 2025, Israel launched strikes aimed at Iran's nuclear facilities and top military leaders. On June 13, 2025, Israel initiated strikes targeting nuclear sites in Iran, marking the beginning of fire exchanges between the two nations and the start of the Israel-Iran war. In retaliation for U.S. strikes against its nuclear program, Iran launched at least 14 missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. According to President Donald Trump, the United States carried out strikes on three of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Operation Midnight Hammer on June 22, 2025."
