Generate Key Takeaways\n\nIShowSpeed was left shocked and seemingly appalled when he met an Amish person who wasn't familiar with Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nThe popular streamer stopped in an Amish town as part of his Speed Does America tour and questioned a server about the outside world. After the woman admitted she didn\u2019t know who he was, Speed seemed pleasantly surprised before revealing his identity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually a YouTuber,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that you don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d\n\nAfter placing an order for a single scoop of strawberry ice cream in a waffle cone, Speed decided to ask if the woman knew who Ronaldo was. She denied knowing about the world-famous soccer player whom Speed seemingly loves more than life itself, prompting the streamer to look bewildered.\n\nCOMPLEX SHOP: Shop the brands you love, anytime and anywhere.

In an adorable moment, Speed told a woman that he\u2019s a professional soccer player in an accent that made her convulse with laughter.\n\nIn another clip, Speed wowed an Amish kid after showing him what a drone was, and the kid ran inside to grab his sunglasses.\n\nThe Speed Does America tour kicked off on Aug. 28. The trek, which will take him across 25 states in 35 days, began with a bang when he met Tom Brady. The two hung out at Brady's Indian Creek Island mansion in Miami, and the NFL star gave Speed a signed Ronaldo rookie card.\n\nThough it was a legendary moment, Speed got frustrated when he discovered that his stream was lagging.\n\n\"Why the f**ksis it lagging while I\u2019m meeting Tom Brady? Why is it lagging? Why is nobody saying shit?\" Speed yelled to his production team.\n\n\"I\u2019m talking to Tom Brady for 10 minutes about his Super Bowl trophies, and ain\u2019t nobody saying shit,\u201d he ranted. \u201cProduction!

In the video, Speed can barely contain his excitement while telling his viewers that he had something very special made. Once the jeweler arrived, Speed took him outside and pulled out his Ronaldo-themed Lamborghini to make the chain reveal moment an event.\nThe jeweler then unwrapped the chain as Speed expressed delight with his purchase. The piece comes with a diamond encrusted chain and pendant of Ronaldo doing his iconic \"Siuuu\" celebration. Speed put the chain on and took several pictures while thanking the jeweler for his work on the piece.\nSpeed is a Ronaldo superfan. He often mimics his \"Siuuu\" celebration and wears the player's jersey. In 2023, Speed made it his mission to meet the Portuguese star in person, but missed his shot on several occasions.\nHe finally got the chance when he attended Portugal's Euro 2024 match against Bosnia and Herzegovina in Lisbon. After the game, Ronaldo exited his car and met with Speed, who was in shock seeing his idol in the flesh, and hugged him which brought a smile to the star's face."

He even joked about filming a quick, 3-minute segment on Ronaldo\u2019s way to the bathroom.\nTo his surprise, Ronaldo was incredibly generous with his time and told Beast\u2019s team they could take as long as they needed, and even invited him to hang out at his house afterward.\n\u201cWe chatted off camera a lot and just hung out. It was just, like, not what I was expecting. I felt like he treated me way better than I ever imagined, very respectful, very giving of his time, and it was a really good experience, to be honest,\u201d Beast recalled.\nThe conversation then shifted to IShowSpeed, 20, and his well-known obsession with Ronaldo.\n\u201cI mentioned Speed and he knew who Speed was, obviously. He's seen it and they met briefly for a couple of seconds at one time, I believe,\u201d Beast said.\n\u201cBut yeah, maybe Speed when you hang out with Ronaldo, maybe just act normal,\u201d he advised. \u201cIt's a word of advice from someone who sat on his couch, spent hours with Ronaldo, like, just be chill. You just be yourself, Speed. Don't cry, don't freak out, don't smell him, definitely don't bark at him.\u201d\nRelated News\npop-culture\nIShowSpeed Says He Had 'One of the Worst Headaches' After WWE Royal Rumble\npop-culture\nMrBeast Adds IShowSpeed to a WhatsApp Group Chat With Cristiano Ronaldo\nsports\nMrBeast Suggests Cristiano Ronaldo Collab With IShowSpeed"

Afterwards, he explained why he barks. \u201cThat came from me when I was a young child,\u201d he said. \u201cCause I grew up in Ohio.\u201d\nAfterwards, Speed raced Carragher live on air.
