      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid starting point but still reads like a high‑level briefing rather than a world‑class research note. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking each macro driver to a specific market transmission mechanism (e.g., CPI → consumer discretionary spend → tech earnings → valuation multiples). Expand the “flows/positioning” section: quantify current sector rotation (e.g., % of S&P 500 in tech vs. financials), highlight ETF inflows/outflows, and note any large‑cap tech “carry” from dividend yields versus growth. Add a brief technical snapshot—mention key moving‑average crossovers, relative strength indices, or support levels for the S&P 500 and major tech names. Ground fundamentals in first‑principles: show how Microsoft’s 39 % Azure growth and 33.6 % payout ratio translate into a projected dividend yield of 0.7 % under a 4.5 % Fed rate, and how Shopify’s 16 % free‑cash‑flow margin supports a 2‑3 % dividend payout in a higher‑rate environment. Quantify risks: e.g., a 2 % CPI rebound could delay the September cut, a $100/barrel oil spike could push the Fed to a 25 bp hike, and a 5 % drop in discretionary spend could compress tech P/E by 10‑15 %. Ensure every claim has a citation—add the missing S&P 500 inflation‑adjusted return source and a Fed policy outlook ID. Reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., if the IEA forecast shows a 2.5 m bpd supply increase but the OPEC+ report indicates a 1 m bpd cut, note the net effect). Finally, condense the watch list to the most decisive signals: July CPI, Fed September meeting, IEA quarterly supply‑demand outlook, and Q1 earnings of Microsoft/Shopify, and state the confidence level in a single sentence. This will elevate the analysis to a concise, data‑driven, and actionable research note.",
