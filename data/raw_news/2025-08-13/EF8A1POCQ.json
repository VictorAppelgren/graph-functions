  "description": "David Dingley, 76, noticed he wasn\u2019t hearing properly in June 2023, but assumed he had a bad cold.",
  "content": "A man was told that his ear infection was actually a sign of a rare brain tumor.\n\nDavid Dingley, 76, noticed he wasn\u2019t hearing properly in June 2023, but assumed he had a bad cold.\n\nHis earing issues persisted, and after multiple visits to his GP, he was diagnosed with an ear infection, and later diagnosed with a blocked eustachian tube and referred to an ear, nose, and throat clinic.\n\nThe blockage continued for a year, and by September 2024, the issue was unresolved, so David was referred for an MRI scan at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital.\n\nThe scan revealed a lesion on his brain, and in November 2024, David underwent two more MRI scans at Southampton General Hospital and confirmed that the lesion was an oligodendroglioma \u2013 a rare type of brain tumor.\n\nCurrently, David is undergoing six-monthly scans due to the tumor\u2019s minimal blood supply.\n\nDavid, retired, from Winchester, Hampshire, said: \u201cI felt absolutely fine, no symptoms whatsoever.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what surprised me the most.\n\n\u201cI had no loss of balance, difficulty with language, no slurred speech, headaches, or blurred vision.\n\nDavid had made multiple visits to his GP since he noticed that he wasn\u2019t hearing properly.\n\nHe was first diagnosed with an ear infection and later a blocked eustachian tube and referred to an ear, nose, and throat clinic.\n\nDespite exercises to ease the blockage, the symptoms continued for more than a year.\n\nBy September 2024, with the issue still unresolved, David was referred for an MRI scan at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital.\n\nAlthough the original symptoms had subsided, the scan revealed something unexpected: a lesion in his brain.\n\n\n\nDavid said, \u201cLesion initially conjured up an image of something quite small.\n\n\u201cBut as soon as I did a little research, I realised this could be serious and meant I had something significant happening to my brain.\n\nIn November 2024, David underwent two more MRI scans at Southampton General Hospital to assess blood flow to the tumor\n\nDoctors diagnosed him with an oligodendroglioma, a rare type of brain tumor.\n\nDavid was presented with three options: a biopsy, surgery, or continued monitoring.\n\nAs he was otherwise fit and healthy, and the tumor showed minimal blood supply, David chose active monitoring.\n\nHe now undergoes regular six-monthly scans, with his next one scheduled for later this month.\n\nDavid said, \u201cI would never have known I had a brain tumor. I still feel perfectly fine.\n\n\u201cBut since my diagnosis, I\u2019ve met so many others who\u2019ve either experienced or lost someone to brain cancer.\n\n\u201cThey are often told their symptoms are stress or migraines until something truly serious occurs.\u201d\n\nDavid has been obliged to report his diagnosis to the DVLA, but as he remains symptom-free and the tumor was discovered incidentally, he has retained his driving license.\n\nDetermined to raise awareness about how brain tumors can develop undetected and be masked by seemingly minor health issues, David is partnering with Brain Tumor Research and will walk 25km across 16 iconic London bridges on September 21, 2025, as part of the Thames Bridges Trek\n\nDavid said, \u201cA time may come when my tumor will cause serious problems.\n\n\u201cBut I am fortunate, at least I have the possibility of acting before it does.\n\n\u201cAny brain surgery, even a biopsy, has risks and means you cannot drive for some time, which makes life difficult in today\u2019s world!.\n\n\u201cWe need better options and more investment in early detection and non-invasive treatment.\u201d\n\nBrain tumors kill more men under 70 than prostate cancer, yet just 1% of the national spent on cancer research has been allocated to brain tumors since records began in 2002, according to the Brain Tumor Research.\n\nLetty Greenfield, Community Development Manager at Brain Tumor Research, said: \u201cDavid\u2019s story highlights how easily brain tumors can be missed and the urgent need for more research.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly grateful for his efforts to raise awareness and funds. Every step he takes helps bring us closer to our goal: improving early diagnosis, treatment options, and ultimately finding a cure.\u201d",

      "text": "The \u2018hearing loss generation\u2019 is younger than you think \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to follow the 60/60 rule\nMillennials are the \u201chearing loss generation\u201d \u2014 you heard it here first.\nSome 1.1 billion young people are at risk of permanent hearing loss, the World Health Organization warns. One study suggested that 10% of millennials \u2014 those born between 1981 and 1996 \u2014 already have some degree of hearing loss.\n\u201cMillennials \u2014 the generation that grew up with earbuds in and concerts as rituals \u2014 may be experiencing higher rates of hearing loss than previous generations at the same age,\u201d Dr. Rachel Trinker, head of audiology for the hearing aid company Audien Hearing, told The Post.\nListening to loud sounds from headphones, concerts or other sources can harm the delicate hair cells in the inner ear\u2019s cochlea. This damage is largely irreversible.\nProlonged noise exposure and infrequent hearing checkups put millennials at risk for health issues linked to hearing loss, such as cognitive decline, depression and social withdrawal.\n\u201cThese potential impacts can begin earlier in life than many people realize,\u201d Trinker said.\nTrinker, a millennial herself, shares four ways that millennials and younger generations can preserve their hearing as they age.\nEar protection\n\u201cMy biggest piece of advice to prevent or reduce hearing loss in young people is to wear ear protection, especially at loud events or places such as sporting events, bars, clubs or concerts,\u201d Trinker said.\n\u201cExposure to environments with noise above 85 decibels, like a crowded restaurant or concert, for long periods of time can lead to permanent hearing damage,\u201d she added. \u201cWith constant exposure, you might start to feel an uncomfortable pressure or ringing in your ears, which can be an early sign of hearing loss.\u201d\nYou should also beware of sudden loud sounds, like gunshots or fireworks, which can cause permanent hearing damage in a split second.\nJust one unprotected exposure to explosive noise, such as a single gunshot at a range, can lead to immediate, irreversible hearing damage.\n\u201cThere are several types of ear protection for different preferences and budgets, including single-use foam earplugs for the budget-minded, custom molded earplugs for the comfort seeker or musician earplugs for the instrumentalist,\u201d Trinker said.\n\u201cI like to keep a pair of earplugs in my car or attached to my keys so they are always with me when I need them.\u201d\n60/60 rule\nKeep the 60/60 rule in mind the next time you want to rock out or listen to your favorite podcast.\n\u201cKeep audio at 60% of the maximum volume for no more than 60 minutes at a time,\u201d Trinker said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to put on your headphones and get lost in your favorite music or podcast, but be aware of how long you\u2019re listening and try to give your ears a break every so often.\u201d\nHearing tests\n\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling tired after straining to listen to a conversation, struggle to hear high-pitched voices or sounds or are constantly asked to turn the TV volume down, these may be signs that you need to get checked out,\u201d Trinker said.\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re not noticing major issues, getting a baseline can help track changes over time and catch problems early.\u201d\nTrinker recommends a yearly hearing test from a licensed audiologist. Many providers offer free screenings \u2014 or tests are often covered by insurance.\nThere are also at-home screening tools, like Mimi, uHear, HearScreen, Digit-in-Noise and MDHearing.\n\u201cWhile these tools are excellent for initial screening and self-awareness,\u201d Trinker said, \u201cthey cannot replace a full diagnostic evaluation by a licensed audiologist \u2014 especially when it comes to identifying complex or asymmetric hearing loss or distinguishing between sensorineural and conductive hearing issues.\u201d\nHearing aids\nEven with only mild hearing loss, hearing aids may be beneficial.\nThey do not fully restore hearing, but they can significantly enhance your quality of life.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common stigma that hearing aids are only for the elderly, but I\u2019m happy to see that this is changing,\u201d Trinker said.\n\u201cEarly intervention hearing aids can help you stay engaged, reduce listening effort, support your overall communication and most importantly, prevent your hearing loss from worsening.\u201d\nWarning signs of hearing loss\nTrinker recommends seeing a medical professional for a checkup if you experience any of these symptoms:\n- Fatigue or stress after conversations, especially when straining to hear\n- A ringing, buzzing or hissing sound in the ear, also known as tinnitus\n- Inability to hear high-pitched voices or consonants like \u201cs,\u201d \u201ct\u201d and \u201cf\u201d\n- Dizziness\n- A feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear"
