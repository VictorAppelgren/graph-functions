  "title": "Trump Administration to End Security Programs Protecting European Allies From Russia",
  "description": "Ending the longstanding program is expected to impact hundreds of millions of dollars that have gone toward countries that border Russia.",
  "content": "The United States will move to end support for a program that helped prepare armies in Eastern Europe to stave off a potential offensive from Russia, the White House said Thursday, as President Trump continues overhauling Washington\u2019s role within NATO and pushing Europe to bolster its defenses and support for Ukraine.\n\nA White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of not being authorized to speak publicly, confirmed the move, which was reported earlier by The Financial Times on Thursday, and is part of phasing out longstanding security assistance programs that provide military support to European nations. The official said the measure aligns with Mr. Trump\u2019s goals of re-evaluating foreign aid and having Europe take more responsibility for its military capabilities.\n\nThe official said the move stemmed from an executive order Mr. Trump signed on the first day of his presidency, which stated that \u201cno further United States foreign assistance shall be disbursed in a manner that is not fully aligned with the foreign policy of the President of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe official also said that the measure, which was reportedly communicated by leaders at the Pentagon in recent weeks, had been coordinated with the affected European nations.",

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. The United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values. They serve to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries that are directly inverse to harmonious and stable relations internal to and among countries.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of United States that no further United States foreign assistance shall be disbursed in a manner that is not fully aligned with the foreign policy of the President of the United States.\nSec. 3. (a) 90-day pause in United States foreign development assistance for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy. All department and agency heads with responsibility for United States foreign development assistance programs shall immediately pause new obligations and disbursements of development assistance funds to foreign countries and implementing non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and contractors pending reviews of such programs for programmatic efficiency and consistency with United States foreign policy, to be conducted within 90 days of this order. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall enforce this pause through its apportionment authority.\n(b) Reviews of United States foreign assistance programs. Reviews of each foreign assistance program shall be ordered by the responsible department and agency heads under guidelines provided by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of OMB.\n(c) Determinations. The responsible department and agency heads, in consultation with the Director of OMB, will make determinations within 90 days of this order on whether to continue, modify, or cease each foreign assistance program based upon the review recommendations, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State.\n(d) Resumption of paused development assistance funding. New obligations and disbursements of foreign development assistance funds may resume for a program prior to the end of the 90-day period if a review is conducted, and the Secretary of State or his designee, in consultation with the Director of OMB, decide to continue the program in the same or modified form. Additionally, any other new foreign assistance programs and obligations must be approved by the Secretary of State or his designee, in consultation with the Director of OMB.\n(e) Waiver. The Secretary of State may waive the pause in Section 3(a) for specific programs.\nSec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 20, 2025."

  "argos_summary": "The Trump administration announced it will terminate a longstanding U.S. security assistance program that helped Eastern European armies prepare for a potential Russian offensive, citing a new executive order to align foreign aid with presidential policy. The move is part of a broader effort to reduce U.S. military support to European allies and shift defense responsibility onto them. The decision is expected to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to countries bordering Russia and reflects a shift in U.S. NATO engagement strategy.",
