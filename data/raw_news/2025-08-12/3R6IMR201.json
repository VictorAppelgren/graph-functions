The winner is Edwin Castro, but if you're looking for more information about the winner, you're going to face some long odds thanks to California's laws.\nHere's what to know about the winner of the record Powerball winner:\nRecent Powerball winner: What to do if you're the winner of $754.6 million jackpot\nWhat do we know about the $2.04 billion Powerball winner?\nOther than his name, nothing.\nAccording to the California Lottery, the lottery is subject to public disclosure laws, meaning the winner's name and other relevant information is publicly revealed. This is what gets revealed, in accordance with state laws:\n- Full name\n- Name and location of retailer that sold winning ticket\n- Date jackpot was won\n- Amount of winnings, as well as gross or net installment payment information\nCalifornia Lottery Deputy Director Carolyn Becker told USA TODAY last month that the winner had up to a year from the draw to come forward.\nAt a news conference Tuesday, lottery officials said Castro declined an invitation to appear publicly.\n\"As you might imagine, anyone would like to largely remain private,\" California Lottery Director Alva Johnson said. \"We offer our sincere congratulations on this unbelievable and historic win.\"\n'Shocked and ecstatic'\nAlthough Castro declined to speak with reporters, he sent a written statement to officials saying he was \"shocked and ecstatic\" to have won.\nCastro added he was glad California public schools benefit from the lottery because he identified as \"being educated in the California public education system.\"\nState officials have Castro's winning ticket and said they're considering putting it on display at the lottery's headquarters.\nMore: An 18-year-old bought a lottery ticket for the first time. She won $48 million.\nHow much money does the $2.04 billion Powerball winner get?\nOfficials said Castro chose the lump sum payment rather than the annuity option, which would have given him his winnings over 30 annual payments.\nBy choosing the lump sum, Castro receives $997.6 million, but that's before taxes.

      "text": "Here are 13 things more likely to happen than winning the Powerball jackpot\nPeople like to dream about winning a lottery jackpot but the odds are rarely in their favor.\nThe odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are 1-in-292 million and there are plenty of things that are more likely. The current jackpot sits at $750 million with a cash option of $465.5 million and numbers will be drawn on Wednesday.\nHere are 13 things that are more likely to happen than winning the Powerball jackpot:\n1. Get audited\nWith tax season upon us, those with incomes over $1 million have a 1-in-25 chance of being audited while people making $200,000 or more have a 1-in-80 chance of being audited, according to The Washington Post. On average, a taxpayer has a 1-in-160 chance of being audited by the Internal Revenue Service.\n2. Find a pearl in an oyster shell\nEver dream of shucking oysters and finding a pearl sitting in the shell? Your chances are highly unlikely, but you still have a better chance of finding a pearl than instantly winning millions. A 1-in-12,000 chance in fact, according to Spey, a high-end jewelry company.\n3. Find a four-leaf clover\nIf you search hard enough, you may just find a four-leaf clover to perhaps secure some luck in winning the jackpot. Dr. John Frett, a professor of landscape horticulture and Director of the University of Delaware Botanical Garden, said there's a 1-in-10,000 chance of finding a four-leaf clover. No guarantee they will help with any future lottery winnings though.\n4. Get struck by lightning\nOften when someone talks about winning a lottery jackpot, someone quips that they are more likely to be struck by lightning than win all that money. They're not wrong. According to the National Weather Service, if someone lives until 80, their chance of being hit by lightning is 1-in-15,300.\n5. Get killed by venomous plant or animal\nWe can't all be Bear Grylls and know which plants and animals are safe for us to interact with in the wild. You have a 1-in-44,459 chance of being killed by a venomous animal or plant, according to the National Safety Council.\n6. Date a supermodel\nYour odds of bumping into Karlie Kloss walking the streets of New York and finding love at first site are not good, but still better than your chances of winning the Powerball jackpot. According to \"Life: The Odds\" written by Gregory Baer, a person has a 1-in-88,000 of dating a supermodel.\n7. Get killed by a bee sting\nFor anyone who saw \"My Girl\" and sobbed their eyes out at Vada yelling that Thomas needed his glasses at his funeral knows that you can indeed die from bee and hornet stings. Some people are highly allergic and can go into anaphylaxis. The National Safety Council estimates that 1-in-46,562 people are killed by hornet, wasp and bee stings.\n8. An asteroid hitting the Earth\nThe thought of an asteroid hitting the Earth is scary enough but the fact you're more likely to be killed by an asteroid than win the lottery is terrifying. According to the National Safety Council, a person in the United States has a 1-in-75,000 chance of dying in a global impact asteroid strike.\n9. Die in a plane crash\nWhile flying in planes is typically considered to be a safer mode of transportation than driving in a car, you still have a better chance of dying in a plane crash. The National Safety Council estimates that people have a 1-in-188,364 chance of being killed in a crash.\n10. Have conjoined twins\nA woman is more likely to have conjoined twins than she is to win Powerball jackpot. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, there is a 1-in-200,000 chance of giving birth to conjoined twins.\n11. Get attacked by a bear\nHumans can sometimes startle bears while camping, which can sometimes lead to bear attacks. In Yellowstone National Park, there have been 38 people injured by grizzly bears since 1980. According to the National Park Service, you have a 1-in-2.7 million chance of being killed by a bear at Yellowstone.\n12. Get attacked by a shark\n\"Jaws\", a movie based off a series of 1917 attacks at the Jersey Shore, may have you questioning a dip in the water. The likelihood of being attacked by a shark is low, but again, not as low as winning the lottery. According to the Florida Museum of Natural History, people have a 1-in-3.7 million chance of being attacked by a shark.\n13. Get killed by a vending machine\nOne day you're trying to get a bag of chips from the vending machine and the next thing you know it's lights outs. According to Amram Shapiro, author of \"The Book of Odds,\" people have a 1-in-112 million chance of being killed by a vending machine.\nAt least you have a better chance to win the lottery than compose the perfect NCAA Championship bracket. There's only a 1 in 9.2 quintillion chance that will ever happen.\nTo quote \"The Hunger Games\" \u2014 may the odds be ever in your favor."

      "text": "New laws in Jersey: Ban on vaping, free school lunches, 'gay panic' criminal defense barred\nVaping products with tempting flavors like mint, chocolate chip cookie and cotton candy must disappear from store shelves and gas station counters in New Jersey in about three months.\nSoon, lottery winners can collect their oversized checks and remain anonymous. More students will get free breakfast and lunch in school, courtesy of taxpayers. And movies and television shows that shoot in New Jersey may get perks from a bigger pool of state funds, all under bills signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy on Tuesday.\nMurphy announced that he signed about 150 bills into law and declined to sign more than 30 others, meaning those items do not become law.\nThose he did not sign would have required depression screenings for school kids and reconfigured licensing of vaping businesses, among others.\nHere's a look at some of the biggest issues on which Murphy took action.\nVaping ban, but no new licensing scheme\nNew Jersey is the second state to enact a ban, after Massachusetts, but will be the first to put it into effect. The law takes effect in the Garden State in 90 days; Massachusetts' ban, which allows smoking flavored products in designated bars, begins in June.\nThe Massachusetts law also applies to menthol cigarettes, which was a controversial part of the New Jersey bill that was ultimately deleted by lawmakers over concern about how it would reduce tax revenue.\n\"As governor, I am first and foremost charged with protecting the health and safety of our people,\u201d Murphy said in a statement, noting that the flavor ban was recommended by a task force he organized last year. \u201cResearch shows that flavored electronic smoking devices and products, such as mint, candy, fruit, and chocolate, are extremely appealing, especially to children.\"\nMurphy signed the bill, S-3265, but did not sign into law a separate bill that would have revamped licensing for vapor businesses and limited the amount of nicotine that could be in vaping products. In a statement, the governor said he \"cannot support a piecemeal approach to a problem that requires a comprehensive solution\" and that the second bill didn't tax retailers equally.\nMillions more for movies, TV in NJ\nProduction companies filming in New Jersey now have a better chance of winning a lucrative film and television tax credit after Murphy signed a bill expanding the tax incentives despite concerns from economic experts. New Jersey will plan to award $100 million a year, instead of $75 million, for film and television projects, and the credits will be available for an additional five years. The state received more applications for tax breaks than was available in the program's funds.\nEconomic experts said the programs don\u2019t create long-term jobs or sustained economic growth, and 13 states have ended their own film tax credit programs. The expanded program could cost New Jersey up to $700 million, and legislative analysts could not predict local and state revenue gains. Administration officials estimated that production companies spent $121 million in the state during the second half of 2018 and are predicted to have spent more than $300 million in 2019.\nLottery winners can be anonymous\nLottery winners can now keep their identities hidden from the public under a law, S-2267/A-3616, that had been rejected in the past but was signed Tuesday by Murphy.\nThe intention is to keep winners from being targeted or even killed because of their new riches, but it also breeds the potential for wrongdoing. Under the old law, winners of prizes over $600 had to disclose their name and address to the state, and the lottery could use their photos for publicity. Winners can still release that information, but they now have the option of remaining anonymous indefinitely. Common concerns with allowing that have been that it would open the door to corruption, lottery insiders would be able to rig games and the state\u2019s transparency would be undermined.\n'Gay panic' is not a criminal defense\nMurphy also signed into law a bill that prohibits the so-called \u201cgay panic\u201d legal defense, in which a person accused of murder claims to have acted \u201cin the heat of passion\u201d because of the victim\u2019s sexual orientation or gender. The state had allowed a murder charge to be downgraded in such instances. It is not a common defense in New Jersey, having been used once unsuccessfully, according to advocacy group Garden State Equality.\n\u201cMake no mistake, the \u2018panic\u2019 defense is flat-out discriminatory legal malpractice, and no one should ever be excused from murder because their victim is gay or transgender,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director, Christian Fuscarino, said in a statement. \u201cAs hate crimes against LGBTQ New Jerseyans continue to rise and trans people are murdered across the nation, it\u2019s more imperative than ever that we ensure our criminal justice system protects LGBTQ people equally \u2014 full stop. Thank you to Governor Murphy for signing this ban into law and sending an unequivocal message that we fully value the lives and dignity of LGBTQ people in New Jersey.\u201d\nMaking school lunches free\nThe state will soon pay $4.5 million to cover the cost of reduced-price lunches for about 60,000 New Jersey students. The bill was a response to \"lunch shaming,\" in which districts publicly punish or identify students who have unpaid lunch bills. Under the law, students from low-income families \u2014 who currently pay 40 cents for lunch and 30 cents for breakfast under a federal assistance program \u2014 will no longer pay out of pocket for meals in public schools.\nReducing tuition for children of immigrant workers\nChildren of non-citizens working in the United States with a specific type of visa can soon qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges. The new law applies to students and dependents of people working in the country on an H-1B visa, which is valid for three years and is granted to people working in \"specialty occupations\" that require at least a bachelor's degree, models and people working for the Department of Defense. To get the lower tuition rate, students must have attended and graduated from an in-state high school.\nHospital oversight\nHospitals will be required to share more financial and operational information with the state and the public under two bills signed Tuesday. Among the requirements are that the state Department of Health notify elected officials when some hospitals are in \"financial distress.\" The laws build upon a law signed last week that increased the state's oversight of hospital finances.\nTax help for veterans\nMurphy signed a bill that would allow more New Jersey veterans to receive a $250 property tax deduction, but it's not yet a done deal. Right now, only veterans who served during times of war and other specific periods are eligible, but lawmakers \u2014 and Murphy \u2014 say all veterans should be eligible regardless of when they served.\nBecause eligibility for the deduction is established in the state constitution, voters will have to approve the tax deduction expansion in November before veterans can benefit.\nMore overnight shelters in cold weather\nWarming shelters that take in the homeless on freezing nights will be open more often under a bill signed by the governor. The law says shelters must open when it is 32 degrees or colder, removing previous language that precipitation should also be taken into account when opening the doors.\nREAD MORE: 'This can save someone's life': Homeless advocates on edge over NJ Code Blue vote\nNJ has a state dog now\nNew Jersey joins a dozen other states with an official state pup. But the Garden State's newest symbol is unique: New Jersey is the only state to pick a guide dog, according to lawmakers. The Seeing Eye dog, now the state canine, is named after the training organization that has been based in Morris County for about nine decades.\nNo depression tests for students\nLawmakers sent Murphy a plan to require public school students in seventh through 12th grade to undergo depression screenings each year, but Murphy did not sign the bill, S-2835.\nThe measure was a response to a report issued last year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said suicides among people between 10 and 24 years old increased 57 percent between 2007 and 2017.\nStacey Barchenger is a reporter in the New Jersey Statehouse.

Winning Ticket is a Bearer Instrument. Note that your ticket is held in trust by Jackpocket as the courier, and a Ticket is a bearer instrument within the meaning of all applicable law, such that the holder of the ticket is presumed to be the owner of the ticket with all applicable rights in the ticket and its proceeds. Therefore, if you obtain possession of your Winning Ticket, do not lose your Ticket or allow others to possess your Ticket. Jackpocket attempts to mitigate this risk by placing the winning customer's name on the back of the Ticket following the ticket being deemed a Winning Ticket, however Jackpocket cannot be held responsible for any lost or stolen tickets or other tickets that, for whatever reason, are not in the winning customer's possession.\n9.
