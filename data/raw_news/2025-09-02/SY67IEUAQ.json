  "description": "The Association of Pickleball Players held its 6th Annual Chicago Open, which saw top pros Sofia Sewing and Jack Munro take double golds, while Champions Pro Lee Whitwell won her second Triple Crown in a row.",
  "content": "The (APP) celebrated Labor Day weekend 2025 with a return to its roots, heading home to hold the 6th annual APP Chicago Open. In 2020, this tournament was the first official event the tour ever held as Chicago-native and tour founder Ken Herrmann launched his vision for professional pickleball. Here we now sit, six years later, and the Chicago Open is one of the longest continually running events in the pro sport.\n\nThis is the 5th year the event has been held in Highland Park, and this is the 9th event of the APP\u2019s 2025 slate of Tier 1 and Tier 2 events. This weekend\u2019s event was broadcast on the Marquee Sports Network, home of the Chicago Cubs, marking the first time Pickleball has been shown on the network.\n\nClick here for the UTRSports.net home page for the event, where you can get tournament details, draw sheets, and results.\n\nNews and Noteworthy ahead of the Event\n\nIt has been a very busy few weeks leading up to the Chicago Open for the APP, with several major announcements. The APP\u2019s media spokesperson Daniel Sagerman has been running ragged for the past few weeks.\n\u2022 On 8/21/25: the APP, which has been hosting its own version of the Collegiate National championships for two years, announced it has partnered with three other groups (National Intramural and Recreational Sports Association (NIRSA), Selkirk Sport and USA Pickleball) to create the Collegiate Series, aimed at growing\n\n collegiate pickleball in the USA.\n\u2022 On 8/26/25: the APP releases its 2026 schedule. The schedule consists of 12 nationally televised APP Tour events, featuring familiar and brand-new tour stops, an expanded APP NextGen calendar, the recently announced APP Selkirk Collegiate Series, and Showcase Events such as the Women\u2019s Open.\n\u2022 On 8/25/25: Ahead of the APP Chicago Open, top APP pro Jack Munro throws out the first pitch at the White sox game.\n\u2022 On 8/27/25: the APP, which in June announced partnerships with Global Sports in India and Pickleball England, added partnerships with several other\n\n organizations to launch the first Global Professional Pickleball tour. The APP adds partnerships with the Canadian National Pickleball League (CNPL), the\n\n European Pickleball Federation (EPF), India\u2019s Global Sports, Australia\u2019s National Pickleball League (NPL), Pickleball England, and Vietnam\u2019s Pickleball D-Joy\n\n to form the alliance. The biggest benefits will be a non-conflicting/planned event schedule (also announced) as well as a global ranking system.\n\u2022 The APP also announced partnerships with Shriners to promote charitable efforts in the sports.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s recap the action from Chicago.\n\nMen\u2019s Singles on the APP is entering a new era of competitiveness, as former champions have moved on and new blood is taking over. Seven of the Eight singles champions so far in 2025 were not in Chicago, which meant a great opportunity for the tour\u2019s up-and-coming players to grab some hardware.\n\nNo. 1 seed Jack Foster, who has medaled in singles no fewer than 13 times on tour without getting a gold, unfortunately had to retire out of his quarter final match, paving the way for No. 5 Ronan Camron to advance into his second pro singles final over Great Lakes Open silver medalist Boyer. From the bottom half, No 3 seed and defending APP event champion Ammar Wazir survived a 16-14 game three win in the quarters over Wade Heerboth to cruise into the gold medal match.\n\nIn the final, Wazir repeated as gold medalist, beating Camron in an epic first game 20-18 and then holding on for the 18,9 win.\n\nWomen\u2019s Pro Singles on the APP has been dominated by two women this year: No. 1 Sofia Sewing and No. 2 Katerena \u201cKat\u201d Stewart. Between the two of them, they\u2019ve won six of the eight titles this season. The two top players have met four times previously this season, with Sewing winning three times in quarter final matchups on her way to titles. However, in Midland a few weeks ago, Stewart got over the hump, topped Sewing in the semis and paved the way for a gold medal.\n\nThe two top seeds ended up on a collision course of the chalk-heavy draw, with Sewing topping No. 5 Turkovic in one semi and Stewart topping No. 3 Hendry in the other. In the final, in their 5th meeting of the season, Sewing took back control of their rivalry with a 12,6 win to take the title. It\u2019s Sewing\u2019s 5th singles gold on tour this year.\n\nIt was a tough weekend for the APP\u2019s top Mixed teams. Three of the four top seeds were eliminated in the quarters or even before, leaving the draw wide open for the No. 2 seeds Megan Fudge & Jack Munro to cruise to the title. They topped Bohnert & Kawka in the quarters, then Megan took out her husband Ryler DeHeart (and partner Rianna Valdes) in the semis before beating No. 5 Daria Walczak & William Sobek in the final.\n\nIt\u2019s the 5th gold for Fudge & Munro in Mixed, and it should be enough to supplant the current No. 1 team (Howells & Oshiro) at the top of the rankings for the top seed in the next APP event. Sobek earns his best ever Pro Mixed medal, having several bronzes in the past but never having made the gold medal match.\n\nAfter missing a couple of events this summer due to MLP duty, the APP\u2019s top Male Doubles team was back together and breezed to a gold medal. No. 1 Will Howells & Jack Munro took the title in Chicago without dropping a game, and without really being challenged along the way, demonstrating the gulf between themselves and the rest of the tour. With the title, Munro secures the \u201cdouble double\u201d for the weekend, winning both Pro doubles titles.\n\nIn the final, they renewed their rivalry with No. 2 Erik Lange & Max Manthou, making this the fourth time this season these two pairs have met in the final. Lange & Manthou made the final by vanquishing the two-time APP defending champs No. 3 Livornese & Tomassi in the semis, a match that was more than a little tense after an awful line-call soured the end of game two.\n\nA great fear amongst the APP\u2019s pro women seems to be coming true; Sofia Sewing is now a threat to win gold in Doubles as well as Singles. Sewing, who quickly ascended to the No. 1 spot in Singles inside of half a season, teamed with Shelby Bates to cruise through the draw as the No. 7 Seeds and secure the Women\u2019s Pro Doubles title without dropping a game.\n\nAlong the way, they beat the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 seeded teams and made a big statement to the rest of the tour. The win gave Sewing a double gold for the weekend (Singles and Doubles), but more importantly gave veteran Shelby Bates her first career APP gold.\n\u2022 Men\u2019s Champions Pro Singles: A badly under-seeded Marco Osorio upset top seed and tour No. 1 Jardim in the 16s and made a run to the final, where he lost to No. 3 Youssef Bouzidi. Bouzidi wins his 4th singles title since April on tour and continues his push for the top spot by the end of his first year on tour.\n\u2022 Women\u2019s Champions Pro Singles: Lee Whitwell took the latest salvo in her competition with Karin Ptaszek-Kochis for the top spot on tour, winning in two games for her second APP title in a row.\n\u2022 Men\u2019s Champions Pro Doubles: Jamie Oncins & Marcello Jardim continued their dominance of Champions Pro doubles on the APP, winning from the No. 1 seed slot.\n\u2022 Women\u2019s Champions Pro Doubles: Lee Whitwell teamed back up with long-time partner Angela Simon to claim their 10th career Champions Pro doubles gold medal together as the No. 1 seed.\n\u2022 Mixed Champions Pro Doubles: Lee Whitwell sewed up the Champions Triple Crown in Chicago by winning the Mixed event with Jardim (who claimed a double gold himself for the weekend). It\u2019s Whitwell\u2019s second straight triple crown on tour.\n\u2022 Men\u2019s Masters Pro Singles: Howard Mendel took his second APP Masters Pro Singles title in a row, beating top seed Treister in the final.\n\u2022 Women\u2019s Masters Pro Singles: Lupita Curiel outpointed Lynn Salo to take the round robin Women\u2019s Masters singles title, just the 5th ever competed on tour.\n\u2022 Men\u2019s Masters Pro Doubles: The Midland gold medalists split up for Chicago and met in the final, with Dan Granot (teamed with Scott Moore) getting the better of his Michigan Partner Howard Mendel (teamed with Miguel Nido).\n\u2022 Mixed Masters Pro Doubles: Heather Iffert & John Moorin took the title as the No. 1 seeds.\n\nThe has now been updated with these results; check out this link online for a complete pro medal history for all tours and all pro events dating to the beginnings of all the major pro tours, plus pro events that predated 2020.\n\nNext up on the Pickleball Calendar? According to my , the APP has two Breakthrough Series events scheduled for September (in Boise and Brigham City), then returns to action the first weekend in November for the 2025 Women\u2019s Cup in Columbus.\n\nAny Head to Head or career match stats quoted in this article are courtesy of PickleWave.

      "text": "The Association of Pickleball Players (APP), the National Intramural and Recreational Sports Association (NIRSA), Selkirk Sport and USA Pickleball are joining forces to serve and grow college pickleball across the United States. Through a variety of initiatives, these four organizations are bringing their strengths to bear for the benefit of the sport, recreation and intramural administrators, and college students, resulting in more pickleball and healthier, more inclusive college communities.\n\u201cI am so grateful for the incredible collaboration between the APP, NIRSA, Selkirk and USA Pickleball,\u201d said Shannon Dan, EVP of Strategy and Growth at the APP. \u201cOur collective mission is to grow the game of pickleball on college campuses, and each organization has stepped up to bring meaningful benefits to college programs and players. From funding and education to equipment and a national competition platform, this offering will be transformational for college pickleball.\u201d\nDominic Catalano, a 20+ year pickleball veteran, coach and lead broadcaster of the APP Tour, will spearhead APP\u2019s leadership as Director of APP Collegiate Series. Catalano will be joined by longtime APP Tour pro Susannah Barr, as College Player and Program Liaison.\nSince debuting in the 2023-24 academic year, the APP\u2019s college property will be primed for its biggest year yet. Now a NIRSA Championship Series event, the APP Selkirk Collegiate Series will officially be sanctioned by USA Pickleball \u2013 making it the only college property sanctioned by the sport\u2019s governing body. The APP will host seven regional qualifiers across the country and culminate the season with the 2026 APP Selkirk U.S. Collegiate Championships hosted at The Courts, Cape Coral in March 2026. In total, college players will battle for $85,000 in prize money, including $5,000 per qualifier and $50,000 in the APP Selkirk U.S. Collegiate Championships.\nLongtime partner Chicken N Pickle expands its successful partnership with the APP and continues as the primary host venue for the APP Selkirk Collegiate Series.

      "text": "United States-based pickleball associations continue their quest to expand their influence abroad, in an ongoing battle amongst titans in the sport to tap into burgeoning markets for pickleball underneath the (more than reasonable) assumption that the sport will experience similar growth abroad that is has here domestically. The latest salvo in that battlefront has been launched.\nOn June 11th, 2025 The Association of Pickleball Players (APP) announced a pair of agreements (one new, one the extension of an existing collaboration) that will help elevate the talent level in events abroad while also bringing the APP\u2019s marketing and logistics expertise into play for growing markets in the sport. The APP is announcing a new agreement with Global Sports Pickleball (GSP), the leading pickleball organization in India and extending their long-standing relationship with Pickleball England, the national governing body (NGB) of the sport in England and operators of the English Open.\nI caught up with the principals of each group to discuss their organizations and these new collaborations; Ken Herrmann (Founder of the APP), Shashank Khaitan (co-founder of Global Sports), and Karen Mitchell (Chairperson of Pickleball England) to talk about these deals and the future of international pickleball.\nThe APP is entering its 4th year collaborating with Pickleball England on the English Open, and have for years been sending both its top touring Pros and its top NextGen stars across the pond to compete. Per Mitchell, the sending of the top US pros \u201chelps elevate the level of play in our events. People want to play where the pros play. This gives people added excitement of playing against that caliber of player. The APP also helps us with sponsorships, streaming of our event to APP-TV, and promotional help on social media.\u201d The collaboration has helped make the English Open not only the largest current tournament in Europe, but the largest outside of the US (they\u2019re projecting to nearly 2,200 players at this year\u2019s event).\nThe English Open is essentially the leading fund-raising event for Pickleball England (the UK equivalent of USA Pickleball), and allows the NGB to fund the operations of the rest of its goals. Says, Mitchell, \"Our focus is grassroots. We\u2019ve developed curriculum to create and train coaches, which we feel will develop more players. We\u2019re going into schools and universities. We\u2019re trying to reduce the average age of players. We want to be the Carlsberg of events.\n[side note: I did not at first understand the context of this comment about Carlsberg. Only after some pointed googling did I learn about Carlsberg Beer\u2019s advertising campaign where they claim to \u201cProbably be the Best beer in the world.\u201d I may have to incorporate this English idiom into my day to day speech]\n.Pickleball England was more than happy to extend its relationship with the APP. Says Mitchell, \u201cI believe that the APP does such great work, both in the US and helping to expand pickleball\u2019s reach internationally. They do right by the players and they genuinely are interested in growing the game internationally.\u201d\nThe timing of announcing the two collaborations together is not without some history; as it turns out, Herrmann of the APP first met Shashank Khaitan of GSP at the English Open two years prior. GSP got its start three years ago, held its first major tournament in February of 2023, and now plays host to three marquee events each year: the Monsoon Championships (held in August), the Indian Open (held in February), and the Global Sports Pro league, which debuted in February this year and featured 100 pro players from all over the globe participating for a total prize purse of $550k.\n(Note: if you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re wondering which of the multiple India-based organizations GSP is, I suggest reading The Dink\u2019s Eric Tice\u2019s excellent comprehensive January 2025 overview of all things Pickleball in that region of the world. It provides an overview of GSP and its evolution of partnerships with other orgs in the region, some of which are now defunct).\nKhaitan describes the beginnings of the APP collaboration, which has been two years in the making, \u201cWe first met at the English Open. We saw APP Next Gen players competing and were really impressed. We started a relationship with some of the APP pros there and became very close with Rob Nunnery in particular. This led to Nunnery and his partner Andrei Daescu traveling to play in the 2024 Indian Open.\"\nNunnery and Daescu won the doubles title in that event, and in the final they played Armaan Bhatia & Harsh Mehta, who stretched them to three games before falling. This of course is the same Bhatia who has now come to the US and medaled in both the US Open and the APP\u2019s NYC Open in May 2025. This turned out to be a seminal match in Indian pickleball, as (in Khaitan\u2019s words), \u201cit showed Indian players where they needed to go, and when Bhatia & Mehta played the American pros in the final, they realized they really could compete against the best.\u201d\nThe most immediate and apparent impact of the APP-GSP collaboration will be the cross-pollination of US-based APP pros in GSP-run events going forward, and vice versa. The top 12 APP Male and Female pros will be offered seeded slots at the forthcoming 2025 Monsoon Open, and will be entered into the league auction for the 2026 iteration of the GSP League. Conversely, GSP will work with the APP to provide more opportunities for both established Asian pros and up-and-coming Indian & Asian players at the APP\u2019s Fort Lauderdale training facilities and academies.\nBoth organizations clearly have respect for one another, and they both share some of the same values when it comes to growing the game. Says Herrmann, \u201cGSP has proven themselves as the premier leading organization in India, and as the APP continues to grow internationally it\u2019s always been my goal to keep my inner circle credible and full of quality people.\u201d Khaitan agrees, \u201cWe believe our ideology with APP is similar; we don\u2019t want to lock players down and want to give players growth experience opportunities.\u201d Herrmann mentioned that the APP is now working on the development of international camps, both at the Fort in December and potentially at Mumbai-based events in 2026.\nPerhaps the most interesting takeaway from my conversations with Khaitan and Herrmann were the statements of their collective visions of international pickleball. One of Herrmann\u2019s longer term goals with partnerships like these is the pursuit of a global ranking system. He says, \u201cI want and foresee results in India to count towards APP rankings. If the No. 1 player from India comes here and there\u2019s a question where to seed him or her, there\u2019s a proven record of results for that player in international events, whether they\u2019re in India or in England or wherever.\u201d\nKhaitan is more expansive. \u201cWe want to set a common goal, see how to build towards it. We want to build something global. Tennis and the ATP really shifted when they globalized and held events all around the world, and we feel the same thing will happen with pickleball.\u201d\nOne thing is for certain; every year that US-based pros extend their presence in major international tournaments and leagues is a year where we get close to these goals. We\u2019ve already seen a top player from India come to the US and succeed at the pro level, and it\u2019s just a matter of time before that becomes a regular occurrence."

In this newly formed alliance, some of the most reputable and established executives and organizations in the sport will work together to create a unified, non-conflicting tournament calendar, a streamlined global-ranking system, a tiered prize money structure, additional commercial arrangements and financial scholarship support, all to benefit career and earning opportunities for the world\u2019s current and aspiring professional players.\n\u201cThis is a monumental day for pickleball worldwide, and the APP is honored to be officially partnering with such a passionate and professional group of organizations,\u201d said APP Founder Ken Herrmann. \u201cThe APP always has been player focused, and now, we\u2019re able to continue that mission worldwide and provide more competitive opportunities for players than ever before. It is our steadfast focus to evolve the credibility and growth of the sport to a place where pros are free and supported to chase their career dreams.\u201d\n2026 Global Pickleball Event Calendar\nAt the heart of the alliance is a year-round world calendar, inclusive of at least 30 pickleball tournaments in 2026, greatly enhancing international opportunities for players across the globe from Canada to Vietnam, India to England and Australia to the United States.\nThe seven initial partner organizations collaborated to ensure no scheduling conflicts occur across each organization\u2019s premier events, ensuring maximum opportunities to take part in competitions for players. The tournaments will be designated into three tiers, each with progressive prize pools and point earnings.\nDec. 5-7, 2025: NPL Invitational (Australia)\nEnd of Jan: Australian Open\nFeb. 3-8: Indian Open (Global Sports)\nFeb. 18-22: APP Daytona Beach Open\nMar. 9-15: Global Sports Pickleball Event (India/Dubai)\nMar. 19-22: Pickleball D-Joy Event (Vietnam)\nMar. 25-29: APP Fort Lauderdale Open\nApr. 13-19: U.S. Open\nApr. 29 \u2013 May 3: APP Sacramento Open\nMay 13-17: APP Southern California Open\nMay 27-31: APP Virginia Beach Open\nJune 10-14: APP Vlasic Classic - Cincinnati\nJune 18-21: Pickleball D-Joy Event (Vietnam)\nJuly 22-26: APP Chicago Open\nJuly 28 \u2013 Aug. 2: Monsoon Open (Global Sports)\nAug. 12-16: English Open powered by the APP\nAug. 19-23: APP Detroit Open\nSept. 3-6: Canadian Open (CNPL)\nSept. 10-13: Pickleball D-Joy Event (Vietnam)\nSept. 16-20: APP Overland Park Open\nSept. 30 \u2013 Oct. 4: APP Women\u2019s Open\nOct. 6-11: European Open (EPF)\nOct. 14-18: Humana APP Louisville Open\nOct. 21-25: Dubai Open (Global Sports)\nOct. 28 \u2013 Nov. 1: APP Arizona Open\nNov. 12-15: APP Pro-Invite Event\nNov. 16-22: USA Pickleball National Championships\nNov. 30 \u2013 Dec. 6: APP Tour Championships + Atlantic Cup\nDec. 11-20: Indian Grand Slam (Global Sports)\n* Dates and locations may vary\n\"I'm thrilled to help usher in a new era of growth for professionals around the globe,\" said Megan Fudge, the APP Tour's all-time career medals leader. \"With more international pros than ever, the competition will be next-level. I'm grateful for the support of the APP and all the alliance leaders to make it happen.\"\nThis global alliance and world tournament schedule is open to welcoming additional organizations to further bolster pickleball's global potential.\nUnified Rankings System\nEach of the events will contribute to a singular, unified global rankings system for professional players, a system that is being developed now by all seven partner organizations. This will ensure all international competitors take part in events on the same playing field, regardless of where they are based, and will launch at the commencement of the 2026 schedule.\nSupporting the Future of International Pickleball\nAlliance members also will work together on cross-promotional commercial opportunities for players and their events, including sponsorship, revenue splits and a unified governance structure. With the initial group of participating global pickleball leaders, support for growing the future of pickleball has never been stronger.\nWhat Other Organizations are Saying About the Alliance:\n\"Collaboration is key to growing pickleball globally. This alliance ensures players can plan their season with confidence, knowing the major events complement each other rather than compete. It\u2019s good for the players, good for the sport, and it demonstrates Pickleball England\u2019s commitment to bringing the international community together.\u201d\n- Karen Mitchell, Chair and Co-Founder of Pickleball England and English Open\n\u201cThe decision to announce a world calendar in alliance with APP and other pickleball organisations across the world is part of our commitment to grow pickleball, offer pro players a structured path to make formidable careers and to build a world community, as it\u2019s this sense of community which is the soul of pickleball.\u201d\n- Shashank Khaitan, Founding Partner of Global Sports\n\u201cThis alliance points the way toward the unity our sport desperately needs. For too long administrative division and opposing factions have held pickleball back. This agreement demonstrates how collaboration can deliver a coordinated international calendar, shared rankings and clearer career pathways for players - bringing higher competitive standards, greater commercial investment, and real opportunities for athletes and organisers alike. Today\u2019s breakthrough shows the path forward and gives us a concrete blueprint to keep pushing toward a truly united world game. The European Pickleball Federation will continue to work with partners to turn this promise into reality.\u201d\n- Frank Arico, President of European Pickleball Federation\n\"This global alliance among respected worldwide pickleball leaders marks a groundbreaking milestone for the sport. It reinforces our shared commitment to its growth and highlights Pickleball D-Joy\u2019s dedication to expanding the game worldwide\u2014especially in vibrant, emerging communities like Vietnam.\"\n- Dang Quang Anh, Vice President and Founder of Pickleball D-Joy\n\"The CNPL is proud to be a part of this alliance which will provide players a new level of opportunity in Canada and globally. This alliance delivers; a year-round schedule that is based on alignment rather than overlap or conflicts, transparent global rankings, and a new level of resources. We are dedicated to fostering excellence through inclusive, innovative platforms that give our athletes a clear and fair pathway to compete globally, inspire community, and build sustainable careers in pickleball. Together, from Canada to England, India, Australia, Vietnam, and the U.S., we\u2019re accelerating the sport\u2019s next stage of professionalization.\"\n- Mike McAnich, Co-Founder, Commissioner of Canadian National Pickleball\nLeague\n\u201cUnity and pathways are the lifeblood of any sport, and this alliance represents a major step forward for pickleball. From the beginning, the NPL has been committed to building opportunities for players and raising the standard of competition across Australia. By joining forces with this incredible group of organisations, we can now extend those opportunities onto the world stage. Together we will bring the world\u2019s best to Australia, showcase our own homegrown talent abroad, and ensure that players everywhere have the support and clarity they need to pursue their dreams. This partnership is proof of what can be achieved when we put players first and work together for the good of the game.\u201d\n- David Anjou, COO of National Pickleball League\nStay Connected with the APP\nAdditional details on the full 2026 APP Tour schedule are available via theapp.global.
