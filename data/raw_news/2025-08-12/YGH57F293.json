  "description": "The \"oracle\" cryptocurrency just secured a major partnership.",
  "content": "\u2022 While much of the crypto market was relatively sleepy, Chainlink popped on news of a key partnership.\n\u2022 The cryptocurrency will team up with the New York Stock Exchange's parent company to bring institution-grade data to the blockchain.\n\u2022 This could help cement Chainlink's role as a key bridge between crypto and legacy finance.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Chainlink \u203a\n\nChainlink (CRYPTO: LINK) is on the rise. As of 5:11 p.m. ET today, it was up 9.4% from Monday at 4:00 p.m. The rise comes as the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and Bitcoin gained 0.7%.\n\nChain Link, an \"oracle\" token that helps bridge the gap between real-world information and crypto blockchains, is teaming up with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe partnership will see ICE's consolidated feed, which pulls data from more than 300 exchanges and marketplaces worldwide, integrated into Chainlink's data streams., This will bring critical financial data to more than 2,000 blockchain applications and financial institutions that interact with the blockchain.\n\nCrypto projects now have access to data of the same quality and real-time speed that traditional finance organizations have enjoyed. Chain Link believes this will help lay the groundwork for large-scale tokenization of assets like precious metals and, more generally, blur the lines between traditional finance and crypto.\n\nICE's Global Data Delivery VP Maurisa Baumann said the partnership will bring \"trusted, structured multi-asset class data\" to crypto platforms and drive crypto adoption in capital markets.\n\nThings are looking up for Chainlink\n\nWhile Chainlink's price is still heavily tied to broader sentiment in the crypto world, this is a major step in ensuring it has long-term value outside of crypto. Institutional integration is key for crypto projects that want to grow beyond the limitations of the crypto market.\n\nShould you buy stock in Chainlink right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chainlink, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chainlink wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $653,427!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,119,863!*",

      "text": "2025 Cryptocurrency Investor Trends Survey\nKEY POINTS\n- Bitcoin Hits $100K: Bitcoin reaching $100,000 boosts interest among existing crypto investors, especially young males.\n- Trump-Musk Influence: Trump's re-election and Musk's involvement lead 50% of respondents to expect positive crypto market performance in 2025.\n- Crypto Skepticism Barriers: Lack of knowledge, buying difficulties, and security concerns deter potential new investors.\nCryptocurrency is once again in the spotlight with Bitcoin hitting a record high of $109,500 in May and the Trump administration taking a friendlier approach to the industry.\nMotley Fool Money's 2025 Cryptocurrency Investor Trends Survey shows interest in crypto is strong -- 21% of respondents to Motley Fool Money's survey own crypto. That's 1 in 5 American adults who own crypto in 2025. This tracks with a separate survey conducted by the National Cryptocurrency Association and Harris Poll finding that 21% of U.S. adults (55 million people) own crypto.\nOverall, 42% of respondents to Motley Fool Money's crypto survey said they're likely to buy cryptocurrency in the next year -- in line with the general level of enthusiasm recorded in 2024.\nRead on to understand the most important trends in the crypto space, as the industry enters a pivotal moment.\nBitcoin hitting $100,000, Trump's return to office buoys crypto enthusiasm\nPresident Donald Trump's re-election and Bitcoin crossing $100,000 in December 2024 gave respondents, particularly those that already own cryptocurrency, reason to be bullish about the industry.\n- Bitcoin crossing $100,000: 48% percent of respondents said they're more likely to invest in crypto in light of Bitcoin being valued at more than $100,000 at one point in December 2024.\n- The Trump-Musk effect: 50% of all respondents say that the cryptocurrency market will perform positively in 2025 given President Trump's re-election and Elon Musk potentially serving as an advisor. Just 13% think crypto will do poorly in 2025, and the remaining 37% think the market won't change much.\nEnthusiasm shrinks and grows depending on respondents' generation, gender, and whether they've ever invested in crypto.\nBitcoin hit a new all-time record of $109,500 in May.\nHow Bitcoin crossing $100,000 is influencing investors\nThirty percent of respondents who have never invested in crypto say Bitcoin crossing $100,000 makes them more likely to invest in crypto, compared to 85% of those who currently own crypto and 83% who are invested in crypto through an ETF.\nA slight majority of male respondents, 54%, say Bitcoin hitting the $100,000 threshold makes them more likely to invest compared to 42% of female respondents. That division tracks with general sentiment towards cryptocurrency investing.\nYounger generations are more likely to be bullish on crypto due to Bitcoin's rise in 2024. Fifty-six percent of Gen Z and 62% of millennial respondents say they're more likely to buy crypto as a result, compared to 46% of Gen X and just 27% of baby boomers. Those results are again in line with how enthusiasm for crypto investing shakes out among generations.\nPotential crypto investors may be more willing to get off the sidelines with Bitcoin setting a new record high of $109,500 in late May.\nTrump and Musk's influence on how investors view crypto\nBitcoin jumped to over $109,000 the day after President Trump was sworn in for his second term, a reflection of the expectation that his administration will be friendly towards cryptocurrencies.\nThat view is shared by 50% of respondents in Motley Fool Money's 2025 Cryptocurrency Investor Trends Survey and an overwhelming share -- 82% -- of respondents that are current crypto investors. Just 13% of all respondents think crypto will do poorly in 2025.\nMen and younger generations are more optimistic about how cryptocurrency will perform with Trump in the Oval Office and Elon Musk being in his orbit. Sixty percent of male respondents said they think crypto will perform positively in 2025 in light of those factors, compared to 41% of female respondents. And nearly 60% of Gen Z and millennial respondents see crypto doing well in 2025 compared to 46% of Gen X and 39% of baby boomers.\nRespondents who devoted more of their portfolio to crypto are more bullish on how crypto will fare in 2025 with Trump and Musk in positions of power. Among crypto owners with 10% or less of their portfolio in crypto, 69% think 2025 will be a strong year for crypto. That percentage jumps to 83% among those whose portfolios are 10% to 25% crypto, and to 90% among those whose portfolios are at least 50% crypto.\n68% of crypto investors think Bitcoin will hit $200,000 in 2025\nSixty-eight percent of respondents that are invested in cryptocurrency believe Bitcoin will essentially double in 2025 to hit $200,000.\nThose who don't own crypto are more skeptical -- 25% of respondents in that group think it's likely Bitcoin will reach $200,00, while 49% are uncertain and 26% think it's unlikely.\nAmong crypto investors, optimism grows dramatically based on how much of their portfolio is composed of cryptocurrency. Forty-six percent of respondents that own crypto and have 10% or less of their portfolio made up of crypto think Bitcoin will hit $200,000 in 2025 compared to 76% of those whose portfolios are 10% to 25% crypto and 90% of those whose portfolios are 75% crypto or more.\nAs with other measures of crypto bullishness, men and younger generations are more likely to think Bitcoin will cross the $200,000 threshold in 2025. Forty-three percent of male respondents said they think it would, compared to 37% of female respondents. 54% of Gen Z and 52% of millennial respondents believe Bitcoin will rise to $200,00 compared to 35% of Gen X and 21% of baby boomer respondents.\n42% say they're likely to buy crypto in the next year\nForty-two percent of respondents to Motley Fool Money's Cryptocurrency Investor Trends Survey said they are somewhat likely or very likely to buy cryptocurrency in the next year. That's a percentage lower than 2023's record high.\nTwenty percent said they are very likely, while 22% said they are somewhat likely.\nCrypto ownership by generation\nYounger generations are leading the way in crypto adoption. According to recent data, ownership is highest among Millennials and Gen Z, highlighting a generational shift in financial behavior and digital asset engagement. Here's how crypto ownership stacks up by generation:\n- Gen Z: 26%\n- Millennials: 37%\n- Gen X: 18%\n- Baby Boomers: 9%\nThe majority of those likely to buy crypto have already invested\nWhile interest in cryptocurrency among respondents is high, most of it is coming from respondents who already own cryptocurrency either directly or through an ETF. Those respondents were much more likely to say that they're likely to invest in crypto in the coming year.\nAmong respondents who have never owned cryptocurrency, just 2% said they're very likely to buy next year, and only 14% said they're somewhat likely. Eighty-four percent said they're unlikely to purchase crypto in the coming year.\nOn the other hand, 66% of respondents who currently own crypto and 67% who have invested in a crypto ETF said they're very likely to buy more this year.\nRespondents who previously owned cryptocurrency but don't hold any right now are somewhat interested in buying this year. Sixteen percent of that group say they're very likely to invest this year, 44% are somewhat likely, 26% are somewhat unlikely, and 14% are very unlikely.\nMen and younger respondents are more likely to buy crypto than women and older respondents\nMale respondents, particularly Gen Z and millennials, are much more likely than women to own cryptocurrency and be interested in investing in it in the future.\nThat demographic trend has been repeatedly observed, including by Pew, JPMorgan Chase, and Morning Consult.\nAs Bitcoin has rallied to a new high, the industry's ability to expand beyond the young male demographic will be instructive as to whether its growth is sustainable and if volatility can be reined in.\nRecord high 81% of crypto owners view it as investment\nA record high 81% of respondents who own cryptocurrency view crypto as an investment. Most respondents don't own crypto to make secure payments or because they think it will replace currencies -- despite those being among the most hyped alleged use cases for cryptocurrencies.\nWhether the shift in crypto owners' attitudes is a boon or dampener for the industry remains to be seen. Much of the initial attraction to crypto was driven by the idea that it could become a global currency and vehicle for secure payments. Those ideas have been slow to take hold while retail investors and now financial institutions increasingly see cryptocurrencies as just another investment class.\nThe top reasons why crypto skeptics won't invest\nThe most-cited reasons why respondents who don't own cryptocurrency haven't invested are not knowing what to do with it (36%), not understanding how to buy crypto (33%), and security concerns (31%).\nTwenty-two percent of respondents who don't own cryptocurrency haven't invested because they don't think it will generate a good return. That's despite Bitcoin hitting record highs. Nineteen percent think crypto is too expensive to buy.\nTwenty-three percent of non-investors won't buy crypto because they think it's a scam and another 22% haven't invested due to the lack of a clear regulatory framework for crypto. Those concerns are likely fueled by crypto's scandal-filled 2023 which may have tarnished its reputation for a slice of the public.\nNo single reason drives crypto skepticism, which suggests that the industry will have to overcome multiple barriers to attract new retail investors. The most-cited obstacles are fundamental and signal that there's a trust gap that will need to be bridged for new investors to enter the market.\n40% would consider investing in crypto through their retirement account\nForty percent of respondents would consider investing in cryptocurrency through their retirement account, down from 44% in 2024 despite Bitcoin hitting record levels.\nThe decline in interest may be attributable to crypto's volatility and the slew of scams, scandals, and security concerns that rocked the industry -- the most notable being the collapse of FTX and revelations of fraud perpetrated by its founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\nThe respondents most interested in adding crypto to their 401(k)s and IRAs are current and previous crypto investors, those with investment portfolios tilted towards crypto, millennials, Gen Z, and men. Non-owners, women, and older generations are least likely to be interested in putting crypto in their retirement funds.\nBeing able to store crypto in a bank account may encourage some to invest\nFifty-six percent of respondents, including 39% of those who have never owned crypto, said that being able to store crypto in their bank account would make them consider investing. That suggests that safety, security, and regulation are keys to bringing new investors into the crypto space.\nStill, the percentage of respondents who would consider buying crypto if they could put it in their bank account is down from 62% in 2022 and 70% in 2021, indicating that crypto's integration with more stable financial institutions isn't a golden ticket to adding investors.\n86% of crypto owners would consider a credit card with crypto rewards\nCrypto credit cards unsurprisingly draw serious interest from crypto investors and some interest from those who have never invested. Twenty-nine percent of that group would consider a credit card that provides crypto rewards.\nThat suggests that crypto credit cards could be an entry point for some crypto skeptics.\nThere are a limited number of crypto credit cards and they are unique in that rewards may be taxable if a gain is realized from them.\nConfidence in crypto understanding is on the decline\nEleven percent of respondents claim to understand how cryptocurrency works \"very well,\" down from 18% in 2024 and 24% in 2022. A record high 38% said they don't understand how crypto works at all, up from 33% in 2024 and 19% in 2022.\nCrypto owners, men, and millennials are most confident about their crypto knowledge, while women and older respondents were more likely to say they have no or little understanding. It would appear that those groups are following the wisdom of only investing in what they understand.\n69% think the government hasn't done enough to regulate crypto\nGovernment regulation of crypto is a hot button topic that divides crypto holders, 61% of whom believe there's enough regulation now, and 83% of non-owners believe that there isn't enough government regulation. Among all respondents, 69% think the government hasn't done enough to regulate cryptocurrencies.\nRespondents who previously owned crypto but don't currently hold any may feel as though they were spurned by insufficient regulation. Sixty-two percent of those respondents don't think there's enough regulation. This is one of the few topics for which that group breaks with current crypto investors.\nEven among crypto owners, those who are least invested want to see more government regulation. Among those whose portfolios are 10% or less crypto, 41% think the government has done enough to regulate cryptocurrencies. That percentage jumps to 64% among those whose portfolios are 10% to 25% crypto, and up to 74% for those whose portfolios are 25% to 50% crypto.\nThe debate over cryptocurrency regulation in the United States centers on whether crypto assets can be considered securities, which would subject them to the same regulations as stocks and other securities. In a blow to proponents of regulation, a district court of appeals in 2023 ruled that cryptocurrency functioned as a security when sold to institutions, but not when traded on exchanges.\nInterest in crypto remains, but the biggest boosters are already invested\nRetail investors surveyed by Motley Fool Money showed near-record interest in crypto, but there are signs that the industry is struggling to grow its pool of investors beyond Gen Z and millennial males.\nConsecutive surveys from Motley Fool Money show that Gen Z and millennial men remain most enthusiastic towards crypto while women, Gen X, and baby boomers are still skeptical of investing. That's despite two developments that could make investors more bullish about cryptocurrency's future: Bitcoin reaching the $100,000 threshold and President Trump returning to the White House with a promise of being a \"crypto president,\" accompanied by Elon Musk as a potential advisor.\nThose findings are consistent with survey results from Pew, which found that interest in crypto among new investors has remained stagnant for years, and that trust remains a significant obstacle to more widespread investment. Morning Consult's quarterly cryptocurrency adoption tracker also shows that the share of adults who own crypto has remained essentially level for years. A 2025 survey from the National Cryptocurrency Association and The Harris Poll found that 21% of American adults, roughly 55 million people, own crypto, and that ownership skews younger and male.\nIntegrating cryptocurrency with existing, trusted financial institutions and products like banks and credit cards could help some overcome their crypto skepticism, but isn't a silver bullet for mass adoption.\nSustainable, long-term, and less-volatile growth in the crypto industry may depend on whether it can correct its demographic imbalance and show would-be investors that crypto is secure, easy to buy, and has real value beyond speculation.\nSources\n- JPMorgan Chase (2022). \"The Dynamics and Demographics of U.S. Household Crypto-Asset Use.\"\n- Morning Consult (2025). \"Tracking Trends in Cryptocurrency.\"\n- The National Cryptocurrency Association (2025). \"2025 State of the Crypto Holders Report.\"\n- Pew (2024). \"Majority of Americans aren't confident in the safety and reliability of cryptocurrency.\"\nMethodology\nMotley Fool Money distributed surveys via Pollfish on Jan. 3, 2025, March 6, 2024, May 25, 2022, and May 6, 2021. Results were post-stratified to generate nationally representative data based on age and gender. Pollfish employs organic random device engagement sampling, a method that recruits respondents through a randomized invitation process across various digital platforms. This technique helps to minimize selection bias and ensure a diverse participant pool. Each survey was composed of 2,000 adult Americans.\nOur Research Expert\nWe're firm believers in the Golden Rule, which is why editorial opinions are ours alone and have not been previously reviewed, approved, or endorsed by included advertisers.

      "text": "Chainlink (CRYPTO:LINK) is a decentralized blockchain oracle network. A blockchain oracle is a service that transfers real-world data to smart contracts (programs running on blockchains). Chainlink allows smart contracts to quickly and securely connect to data sources.\nIt's an important service, and it gives Chainlink a wide range of use cases across many different industries. Read our full Chainlink guide to learn more about how it works and why it's one of the best cryptocurrency investments.\nWhat makes Chainlink unique?\nWhat makes Chainlink unique?\nThe reason Chainlink is so useful is that it connects smart contracts on blockchains to real-world data and events.\nSmart contracts are blockchain programs that self-execute when specific conditions are met. They're one of the most widely used blockchain tools, and blockchain platforms capable of running smart contracts are extremely popular. But they have a limitation referred to as the blockchain oracle problem. They can't interact with off-chain data or any information not on the blockchain.\nBlockchain oracles solve that problem. An oracle is a bridge that brings a smart contract the data it needs. It's also important that the smart contract receives accurate data, and that's where the Chainlink Oracle Network comes in.\nChainlink is made up of various decentralized oracle networks. Each network consists of multiple blockchain oracles that retrieve and validate data. This allows smart contracts using Chainlink to get data from tens to hundreds of oracle nodes and aggregate the result instead of relying on a single oracle.\nBeyond connecting smart contracts to data, Chainlink's ambitious version 2.0 expands its set of services to include connecting smart contracts with off-chain computation, payments, and events. With the expansion of off-chain functionality, Chainlink sees the evolution of a whole new class of \"hybrid\" smart contracts -- and with Chainlink nodes in the middle of it all.\nChainlink also cleverly expands its ecosystem by enabling data providers to sell their data directly to blockchain applications (on any blockchain) simply by connecting their application programming interface (API).\nWhere Chainlink came from\nWhere Chainlink came from\nSergey Nazarov, Steve Ellis, and Ari Juels published the original Chainlink white paper and began developing the project in September 2017. They also held an initial coin offering (ICO) that month, selling 350 million LINK tokens (35% of the total supply) and raising $32 million.\nChainlink launched its network in May 2019. The project is managed by a corporation registered in the Cayman Islands, Smartcontract Chainlink, Ltd., and the Chainlink Labs organization.\nHow Chainlink works\nHow Chainlink works\nAlthough Chainlink is in a multi-year process of expanding its oracle features, the way it currently provides data to blockchain applications works like this: When a user needs off-chain data through Chainlink for their smart contract, they put out a request. The Chainlink protocol responds by creating a service-level agreement (SLA). The SLA includes three sub-contracts, each with its own function:\n- Chainlink Reputation Contract: Reviews oracles' reputation scores and discards any that are unreliable.\n- Chainlink Order-Matching Contract: Brings the request to oracles, takes bids, and selects the oracles that will handle the request.\n- Chainlink Aggregating Contract: Receives that data from the oracles and validates it. For example, if most oracles provide one response, but two provide other information, it will discard the responses of those two oracles.\nChainlink isn't limited to oracles that are part of its network. It can also gather data from outside oracles using its Chainlink Core software and external adapters. Here's how they work:\n- Chainlink Core: Reads the request and routes it to a Chainlink node.\n- External Adapter: Connects the node with an external data source and translates requests from a blockchain programming language to a real-world programming language.\nUsers pay Chainlink node operators (which deliver off-chain data) in LINK tokens. Node operators set the prices for their services.\nChainlink nodes also need to stake LINK, meaning they lock up those tokens on the blockchain as collateral. The amount of LINK a node has staked is one factor in its reputation score. If a node is unreliable or dishonest, the Chainlink protocol taxes its LINK stake. This helps ensure that nodes provide accurate information.\nPartnerships\nPartnerships\nBecause it provides such a valuable and essential service, Chainlink has built up a massive list of partners, including many of the biggest blockchain networks, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and crypto games. Here are some of the major blockchain networks that are using Chainlink:\n- Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH)\n- Cardano (ADA 8.49%)\n- Solana (CRYPTO:SOL)\n- Polkadot (DOT 7.16%)\n- Terra (CRYPTO:LUNA)\nOne of the most notable companies working with Chainlink is Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%), which decided to use Chainlink for its Google Cloud service. The partnership involves Google putting its BigQuery data on the blockchain through Chainlink.\nA major Chainlink partner in the crypto industry is the Binance crypto exchange. It uses Chainlink to connect its data to blockchain platforms.\nKeep in mind that those are just a small selection of some important connections made by Chainlink. The Chainlink ecosystem contains more than 1,000 partnerships and collaborations.\nCan I make passive income with Chainlink?\nCan I make passive income with Chainlink?\nYou can make passive income with Chainlink by lending your LINK tokens to a crypto lending program. If you're a U.S. resident, CoinLoan and Gemini are two platforms that support Chainlink lending. While Gemini is considered one of the top crypto exchanges, CoinLoan offers much higher interest rates on LINK.\nLending crypto has its risks. Like any other type of lending, you can lose your funds if a borrower defaults.\nUnique risks\nUnique risks\nTo Chainlink's credit, it doesn't have any glaring weaknesses or flaws. The price is volatile and it's part of a very new, unproven industry, but that's the case for all cryptocurrencies. If you're going to invest in any types of cryptocurrency, volatility and risk come with the territory.\nChainlink has gotten attention for its token distribution. A 2021 report found that 125 wallets held 81% of the total LINK supply, with Chainlink node operators holding 35% and the Chainlink team almost 25%.\nAlthough this can lead to worries that a small group of whales (investors who own large amounts of crypto) have too much control, that doesn't seem like the case here. The Chainlink team was open about token distribution from the beginning and how it would use its supply to fund development. A large part of the reason Chainlink has been so successful is because the team has had the funds necessary to expand.\nIs Chainlink a good investment?\nIs Chainlink a good investment?\nChainlink is a quality investment that's worth considering if you're building a cryptocurrency portfolio. It offers excellent utility, widespread adoption, and has a significant first-mover advantage compared to other decentralized oracle networks.\nSmart contracts on every blockchain network need (and will continue to need) real-world data. Chainlink provides an efficient and accurate oracle solution. The fact that there are already so many projects using the Chainlink network is a testament to its utility.\nAlso boding well for Chainlink's growing adoption is the fact that it\u2019s blockchain-agnostic and not tied to any single network. Chainlink also has shown initiative in proposing a global, open-source standard for cross-blockchain messaging, the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Whether or not CCIP becomes a popular global standard, its proposal is significant, and it puts Chainlink in a high-profile position as the blockchain industry continues to evolve.\nWhen you look at the oracle token market, it's apparent that Chainlink is in a very strong position. None of its competitors even come close in terms of size. As of May 2022, no other oracle token had even one-tenth of Chainlink's market cap or had broken into the top 100 cryptocurrencies.\nThat being said, it's also important to be cautious about any cryptocurrency investment. As mentioned earlier, prices are volatile, and they can rise or fall quickly. If you decide to invest in Chainlink, other projects, or cryptocurrency stocks, be cautious about how much you spend.\nRelated investing topics\nHow to buy Chainlink\nHow to buy Chainlink\nSince Chainlink is one of the larger cryptocurrencies, there are plenty of exchanges that list it.
