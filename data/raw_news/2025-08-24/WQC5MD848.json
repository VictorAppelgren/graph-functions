  "title": "Ditch Streaming and Discover Thrift Store CDs",
  "description": "Somehow cheap and bourgeoisis at the same time.",
  "content": "Spotify, Apple Music, or whatever service you use is getting more fragmented and more expensive. You're probably listening to the same set of albums over and over, like most people, too.\n\nIf that sounds like you, it might be a good idea to take the few dollars you spend on music streaming each month, and take a trip to your local thrift store instead, to start building a music collection worth having.\n\nThrift stores, pawn shops, and their online equivalents are great places to buy the CD collections of people who have decided that they don't need these plastic discs anymore. Also, every time I browse Facebook Marketplace there's at least one person in my town selling what seems to be their entire CD collection.\n\nSure, 90% of them are going to be horrible compilation albums (Now That's What I Call Atrocious), but the whole shebang is usually so cheap that you can buy it for one or two good albums, and then get your money back by selling the rest to people with no taste in music.\n\nI've been to used goods stores where CDs have been marked down to whatever the smallest denomination you can get with sales tax included. A few cents apiece. They'll even provide the shovel and wheelbarrow.\n\nJokes aside, we seem to be at a point where most people really don't value physical music on CD anymore, which means it's the perfect time to build the collection you could never afford when CDs were the only way to listen to digital music.\n\nRipping CDs Is Both Easy and Legal-ish\n\nSo you've bought a bunch of CDs, but what are you supposed to do with them? They won't go in your phone, and that's what you use to listen to your music! You need to \"rip\" the songs from the CD and then transfer them to your music-playing devices to enjoy them.\n\nOne part of the puzzle is of course, a drive that can read CDs. Any old cheap USB DVD drive will do the job, though if you can afford a decent brand-name model, that's going to be better for your CDs, and there's less chance of read errors or slow performance. Then, you'll need some ripping software.\n\nExact Audio Copy is the weapon of choice, as most audiophiles will tell you, but there are plenty of options. So, is it legal to rip CDs you own? That depends on where you live in the world, but in the United States, the RIAA says it \"won't usually raise concerns\" as long as:\n\u2022 You own the original authorized CD.\n\u2022 The copy is for your own personal use.\n\u2022 You don't give copies away or sell them.\n\nIf you get rid of the original CD, you need to destroy the copies you made too. Also, while making a backup of a CD you own is generally OK, some CDs have copy protection (Sony is infamous for this) and breaking the copy protection of any media is in and of itself illegal under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or DMCA.\n\nYou Can Set Up a Music Server in Minutes\n\nYou can always just copy your ripped music to your phone or other device and play it from there, but if you want convenience similar to services like Spotify, you'll want a music self-hosting solution. I use Plex Amp, which works well as a free solution if you just want to stream music around your house, but you need a Plex Pass to download music for offline play or for remote streaming.\n\nA popular solution is the free and open-source software Navidrome. If you have an Android device, you can use the Symfonium app to connect to Navidrome and many other music servers, but Symfonium has a one-time fee. On an iPhone, you can use Amperfy.\n\nWhen You Have Enough Music, Just Stop Paying\n\nAfter a year of spending your streaming music budget buying CDs from thrift stores, I'm willing to bet you'll have more than enough music to listen to for the foreseeable future. If you also feel you've now amassed enough music\u2013you can just stop paying. Yes, I know it's a revolutionary concept, but you can actually just keep enjoying your pristine CD-quality music without spending any additional money.\n\nIf anything ever goes wrong with your ripped music, well you still have the original CDs to rip the music again. Just take care of the discs by storing them in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. In most cases, they should outlive you!\n\nWhat about new music? Well, when your favorite band or performer brings out a new album (which usually happens no faster than once a year) you can splurge on those albums or singles as they release, and add them to your store of pristine digital music. Now I only have to convince everyone on my Spotify Family Plan to switch back to CDs...",

      "text": "Introduction\nExact Audio Copy is a so called audio grabber for audio CDs using standard CD and DVD-ROM drives. The main differences between EAC and most other audio grabbers are :\nAdvertisement / Anzeige\n- It is free (for non-commercial purposes)\n- It works with a technology, which reads audio CDs almost perfectly. If there are any errors that can\u2019t be corrected, it will tell you on which time position the (possible) distortion occurred, so you could easily control it with e.g. the media player\nAdvertisement / Anzeige\nWith other audio grabbers you usually need to listen to every grabbed wave because they only do jitter correction. Scratched CDs read on CD-ROM drives often produce distortions. But listening to every extracted audio track is a waste of time. Exact Audio Copy conquer these problems by making use of several technologies like multi-reading with verify and AccurateRip."

This was enough for me to warrant purchasing almost immediately despite the trial period. This is an experienced developer who has designed and supported his other app for years, which gives me added confidence. \"\nPlay Store comment\n\" Just stumbled on this app coming from PlexAmp. This is so much nicer and more user friendly than PA. I see a lot of recent development and it appears the Dev is very active on reddit and super responsive. I didn't even wait for the trial to end and was happy to buy it right away. Can't wait to see what this already well put together app will end up. Well done! \"\nPlay Store comment\n\" This is my favorite music app for my Jellyfin server. What I like the most: Replay Gain support, dynamic playlists, dynamic theme (player fits colour scheme to the currently played album), fully customizable UI, a very good equalizer and a adjustable bitrate for downloads. It just makes fun using this app with my large music collection. Please keep up the good work and thank you for putting so much effort into it. \"\nPlay Store comment\nStill have some doubts?\nWhat does this app do?\nThis app is a simple yet advanced music player. With a gorgeous configurable interface and advanced equalizer, it offers the most complete music experience on Android.\nWhat makes this app different from others?\nThis music player stands out for its configurable, beautiful and user-friendly interface, its powerful equalizer with AutoEQ support, and its ability to aggregate your music from many sources like your Android device, Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, Subsonic, OpenSubsonic, Kodi, Samba (SMB v2/v3), WebDAV servers or supported Cloud providers (Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox, Box, pCloud).\nWhy is the application paid?\nThe application is paid because it offers a high-quality service that is free of ads and respects your privacy.

It works great! It handles my 4K+ artists and 90k+ songs very well. Nice user interface. I really like the way it supports creating and managing an active playlist/ song queue, and allows for adding or removing songs. Some of the clicks don\u2019t give feedback (e.g. when clicking a song to add to play next queue, it doesn\u2019t give an indicator that it was added). Overall this is a great player for subsonic and I\u2019ll be using it a lot. Thank you!\nDoesn\u2019t work for any codec not compatible with iOS\nIt doesn\u2019t trigger the transcode on the server side (at least not in navidrome), so if you got a codec not compatible with iOS, it won\u2019t ask the server to transcode, and you won\u2019t be able to listen to that song Other apps work, so it\u2019s just the way this app handles the request That said, this app is wayyy more polished and looks way better than most subsonic apps there (and allows for song list, many subsonic apps show just albums and artists) Would be good to have the app ask the server to change the codec on the fly to mp3/flac so iOS can play it\u2026 And would be awesome to get support for the radio stations already set up on the server\nEdit: CarPlay just shows recently added songs/artists/albums and favorite songs/artists/albums but there isn\u2019t a way to see all your collection\nUpdate ruined it for me\nI loved Amperfy, I have been using it for quite a while now to listen to music off my Navidrome server. It\u2019s been great, the interface was clean and simple, and everything worked how I expected/wanted it to. Last night there was an update that I ran, and now this morning I see what it was. Now if I go to my albums and hit shuffle, it doesn\u2019t just shuffle all my music like it has since forever, no, now it picks a random album and only plays music from that album. I had to add the Songs tab to my homepage and I have to shuffle everything from there. Also the playback menu has changed and has way more unnecessary buttons and things I never asked for nor cared to have. I thought Amperfy was going to be my sole music app for my phone, now I guess I have to start looking for a new one. Maybe I\u2019ll just go back to Plexamp.\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, Dirk Hildebrand, indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

      "text": "Summary\n- Use Facebook Marketplace to reach more buyers and pay for ads for faster sales.\n- Insist on in-person sales only to avoid scams related to shipping.\n- Demand cash payments to prevent potential scams with electronic payment systems.\nI constantly have old gear and knicknacks to get rid of, and Facebook Marketplace is ideal to get some cash back fast. However, it can be a scammer's haven, espcially if you're desperate to sell or don't stop to think. So far, touch wood, I've avoided being scammed, but only by being steadfast on some fundamental rules.\nFacebook Marketplace Is My Favorite Place To Sell\nBefore Facebook Marketplace, I listed items all over the place on various sites. This is obviously a chore, but it was the only way to maximize the odds of selling my stuff quickly. Facebook Marketplace's massive advantage is in the sheer number of people who use Facebook. It might be a bit of a meme that mainly older folks use this platform, but maybe that's a good thing when it comes to finding people with disposable income.\nI also happily pay for Facebook ads for my more expensive listings, and in my experience, this really helps. It's worth paying $5 to sell a $500 item quickly, and Facebook Marketplace makes it much less of a chore to set up an ad than other services I've used in the past. Ever since I realized how quickly and easily I can sell stuff here, I haven't bothered listing things anywhere else.\nI Never Ship Anything\nMy first ironclad rule is that I never ship anything. I will only sell something in-person. One of the best things about Facebook Marketplace is that you can specify how far away people can be from your location, and I generally set it to within an hour's drive of my address.\nWhen someone contacts me insisting that I ship something to them, I just politely decline. Not only is shipping part of many scams, even in legitimate situations, it's risky and frankly expensive in many cases. So it's an in-person sale or no sale.\nCash or Nothing\nIt's so easy these days to use services like PayPal or Venmo to send money to people, but I will always demand cash until the day cash itself is abolished. There are far too many ways that scammers can use electronic payment systems to spoof or later reverse payments. Since I don't know who they are or where they live, I have no recourse if a payment is reversed or disputed. Cash, once it's in my hands, is much harder to pilfer.\nYou Found It Cheaper? Go Buy That\nI generally include about 10% leeway in my listed prices so that the hagglers can get some satisfaction while I get the amount I wanted in the first place. However, there are certain buyers who will agree to a price with you, arrange to come make the purchase, and then shortly before let you know they've found the same thing cheaper elsewhere.\nHowever, if you lower your price they'll still buy yours. This is such a silly tactic, that I have a hard time believing it ever works, but every time someone's tried this on me, I have called their bluff and still sold at my original price.\nI Can Wait, Can You?\nWhether it's a scammer or just a hard negotiator, my most powerful self-imposed rule is to be patient. Scammers want to rush you so you don't think critically, and buyers looking to rip you off are easy to ignore. Let your listing sit, refresh it when needed, but don't sell under terms or at a price that doesn't sit right with you.\nAs long as you've priced your item fairly compared to other sellers, you will eventually get it sold. If you're actually desperate, then take the initiative to price it in such a way that yours will go first, but if you're not in a true hurry then it's time for diamond hands, as the crypto fans like to say."

  "argos_summary": "The article encourages listeners to buy inexpensive CDs from thrift stores and online marketplaces, then rip them to digital files using tools like Exact Audio Copy and a USB CD drive. It explains that making personal backups is generally legal in the U.S. if you own the CD and keep copies private, while noting that breaking copy protection is illegal. After ripping, users can host their music on free or paid self\u2011hosted servers such as Plex Amp, Navidrome, Symfonium, or Amperfy to stream anywhere, potentially eliminating the need for paid streaming services. The piece also offers practical tips on preserving CDs and updating the collection with new releases, suggesting that a well\u2011curated CD library can provide long\u2011term, cost\u2011free music enjoyment.",
