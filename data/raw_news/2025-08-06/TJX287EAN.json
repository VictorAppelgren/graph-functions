  "content": "The meeting between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday was \u201cconstructive and useful,\u201d the Kremlin said, according to Russian state media TASS.\n\nThe meeting took place amid the backdrop of a looming sanctions deadline threatened by US President Donald Trump if Russia does not agree to a peace deal with Ukraine.\n\nWitkoff and Putin discussed Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine, state media outlet RIA Novosti reported, citing the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cPutin conveyed some signals to the United States on the Ukrainian issue. Corresponding signals were also received from President Trump,\u201d RIA said in a post on social media, adding that the Kremlin said it will release more information on what was discussed after Witkoff reports back to Trump.\n\nThe meeting lasted about three hours, state media reported, citing the Russian presidential press service.\n\nEarlier in the day, the US envoy was greeted at the airport in Moscow by Russia\u2019s investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Video later posted by the Kremlin showed Witkoff shaking hands with Putin ahead of their meeting.\n\nTrump has grown increasingly impatient with Russia\u2019s resistance to his peace efforts. Since the last meeting between Witkoff and Putin in April, Russia has ramped up its assault on Ukraine, attacking cities with an onslaught of missiles and drones.\n\nTrump has called Russia\u2019s attacks \u201cdisgusting\u201d and has accused Putin of peddling \u201cbullsh*t\u201d in their tense phone conversations.\n\nPrior to Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Trump said that he would wait for the outcome of the talks to decide whether or not to impose new sanctions on Russia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens,\u201d the president said at the White House. \u201cWe\u2019ll make that determination at that time.\u201d\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

      "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s trusted foreign envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, after the Kremlin requested that Witkoff visit in a last-ditch effort to avoid the punishing new sanctions Trump has threatened to impose this week, people familiar with the matter said.\nWitkoff landed in Moscow on Wednesday morning and was greeted at the airport by Russia\u2019s investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, Reuters reported. Video later posted by the Kremlin showed him shaking hands with Putin ahead of their meeting.\nThe meeting ended after about three hours, Russian state media TASS reported, citing the Russian presidential press service.\nWhether Putin was able to convince Witkoff \u2014 and, by extension, Trump \u2014 that he is interested in ending Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine remains an open question. Trump has cast doubt on Putin\u2019s willingness to stop the fighting and appears wary of being strung along by a leader he now openly distrusts.\nPutin, meanwhile, has maintained his maximalist ambitions for the conflict, including capturing the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson and insisting Ukraine limit the size of its military.\nTrump said a day ahead of Witkoff\u2019s meeting he would wait until the talks conclude to decide whether to impose the new sanctions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens,\u201d he said at the White House. \u201cWe\u2019ll make that determination at that time.\u201d\nWhen asked by a reporter after arriving in Russia, Witkoff did not share his expectations ahead of the talks, Russian state media TASS said.\nThe environment in Moscow will be far different than the last time Witkoff sat down with Putin in April \u2014 with Trump\u2019s frustration toward his Russian counterpart mounting in recent months. Since the April meeting, Russia has resisted US-led efforts to broker a peace in Ukraine, ramping up an onslaught of missiles and drones that have targeted Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv.\nA day ahead of Witkoff\u2019s visit, Trump spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss potential sanctions on Moscow, according to people familiar with the conversation. In a readout of the meeting posted on social media, Zelensky said those sanctions could \u201cchange a lot\u201d when it comes to the Russian economy.\nZelensky also said they discussed the increase of American weapons support to Ukraine, paid for by NATO allies, a policy Trump green-lit last month.\nThe US president has grown increasingly impatient at Russia\u2019s resistance to his peace efforts, calling the air attacks \u201cdisgusting\u201d and accusing Putin of peddling \u201cbullsh*t\u201d in their tense phone conversations.\nHe has set a Friday deadline for Russia to either agree to a peace deal or suffer new sanctions, including on its own economy and on purchasers of its energy products. Trump truncated his original 50-day timeline after seeing little movement from Russia. Yet he has also cast doubt that any new sanctions will prove effective after Moscow found ways to skirt the heaps of western measures applied since the war began.\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be sanctions, but they seem to be pretty good at avoiding sanctions,\u201d Trump said Sunday. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re wily characters, and they\u2019re pretty good at avoiding sanctions. So we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\nTrump also announced late last week that he was ordering the repositioning of two US nuclear submarines in an effort to be \u201cprepared\u201d \u2013 a response to inflammatory remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, Russia\u2019s former president and current deputy chairman of its security council.\nBut even Secretary of State Marco Rubio said after those comments that Medvedev was not a relevant player and explained that his remarks were unlikely to \u201cbe a factor one way or another.\u201d\nSome Europeans officials viewed Trump\u2019s announcement as a possible effort to highlight US nuclear capabilities in preparation for Witkoff\u2019s visit, two sources told CNN. It remains unclear if the US actually repositioned any of its nuclear submarines.\nSanctions threat\nTrump has threatened two distinct types of measures should Moscow not reach Friday\u2019s deadline for peace. He has said he\u2019ll apply new sanctions on Russian imports to the US, which would have minimal impact given the near-stoppage in trade between the two countries since the start of the war.\nTrump has also promised \u201csecondary tariffs\u201d on countries that import Russian energy \u2014 which would include China and India, the country\u2019s largest energy customers. That could potentially do more to cut off funding for Russia\u2019s war machine.\n\u201cIs August 8 an actual deadline or part of Trump\u2019s approach, which often involves manufacturing leverage points, and then determining how to use them?\u201d said one US official. \u201cIt is not real until Trump decides it is, which is based on a number of unidentified variables.\u201d\nThere have been active efforts to draw up those possible secondary sanctions in recent weeks, US officials said, adding that they believe that Trump\u2019s frustration with Putin is so intense that he might green light those measures. But Trump is also likely to back down if Russia makes a substantive offer, sources said.\n\u201cThese are gut feelings for him,\u201d said one source close to the White House. \u201cIt depends how he can sell it to his base.\u201d\nThe US and its western allies have taken numerous steps to try stifling Moscow\u2019s energy revenues, including applying a price cap on Russian crude. But so far, it hasn\u2019t caused Putin to change course. And Russia has been able to evade some of the measures on its energy products by using a \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of tankers, whose ownership is hidden, to sell to China and India.\nTrump said that could change if the price of Russian oil drops significantly.\n\u201cPutin will stop killing people if you get energy down another $10 a barrel. He\u2019s going to have no choice because his economy stinks,\u201d the president said in a Tuesday telephone interview on CNBC.\nRussia\u2019s economy has seen recent signs of weakness, including rampant inflation and higher food costs, as the weight of the three-and-a-half year war begins to take more of an effect.\nTrump has already said he\u2019ll apply a substantial tariff hike on India for its Russian energy purchases as he simultaneously works to extract concessions from New Delhi on a trade deal.\n\u201cThey\u2019re fueling the war machine, and if they\u2019re going to do that, then I\u2019m not going to be happy,\u201d Trump told CNBC.\nIndia has argued its Russian energy purchases have stabilized the global oil market.\nIt\u2019s less clear how intent Trump is on applying new measures on China for its Russian energy purchases. He remains on the hunt for a comprehensive trade agreement with Beijing, and US officials have described making significant progress in recent talks with their Chinese counterparts. Still, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent directly told his Chinese counterparts during trade talks in Stockholm last month that they should be ready for sanctions if they continue to buy Russian oil.\nPutin and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping have also deepened their relationship in recent years, and Chinese support for Russia\u2019s war efforts extends well beyond energy purchases. China has provided Russia with components for its weapons and drones used to attack Ukraine.\nPutin and Xi are expected to meet in Beijing at the start of September around a commemoration ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.\nA test for Witkoff\nIn recent months, Witkoff played a less active role in the Ukraine war talks due to Russia\u2019s refusal to take substantial steps to drive an end to the conflict.\nDuring that time, Trump and Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg maintained regular communications with the Ukrainians, with Kellogg visiting Kyiv last month.\nTrump also began to change his tone on Ukraine, saying it needs the ability to defend itself.\nBut with Witkoff visiting Russia again for the first time in months, there is a renewed spotlight on his role. Earlier this year, there were concerns among US officials and Russia experts about the real estate developer\u2019s diplomatic inexperience, particularly after he went into multiple early meetings with Putin without a US translator by his side.\nAfter his last meeting with Putin, Witkoff predicted the Russian leader \u201csees the opportunity for the first time in decades\u201d to recalibrate the US-Russia relationship \u2014 though months later the war is ongoing and US-Russia relations have not improved.\nStill, even as talks with Russia took a backseat in recent months, Witkoff stayed engaged on Gaza talks and Iran talks, maintaining an active role in Trump\u2019s inner circle.\nThis article has been updated with additional information. CNN\u2019s Anna Chernova and Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report."
