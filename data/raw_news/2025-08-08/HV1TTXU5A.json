Tompkins extorted a cannabis company to give him a sweetheart stock deal.\n\nThe indictment refers to the cannabis company only as \u201cCompany A\u201d and states it was first licensed to operate in Boston around March 2021.\n\n25 Investigates found details within the indictment and public records strongly suggest the company was Ascend-Mass LLC, a prominent player in the Massachusetts marijuana industry.\n\nThe indictment claims Tompkins used his position to pressure the company, which opened Boston\u2019s first recreational marijuana shop, into granting him preferred stock and then Tompkins allegedly asked for money back after the stock went public and later dropped in value.\n\nThe stock performance details mentioned in the indictment include a one-time value of $9.60 a share matches the public stock performance of Ascend-Mass LLC\u2019s parent company, Ascend Wellness Holdings.\n\nThe cannabis company had an agreement with Tompkins\u2019 Sheriff\u2019s office to hire former Suffolk County inmates with past drug convictions as a part of its \u201cPlan for Positive Impact on Areas of Disproportionate Impact,\u201d as required by the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission (CCC).\n\nThe indictment alleges the company feared Tompkins, \u201cwould use his official position as Sheriff to jeopardize Company A\u2019s partnership\u201d with the employment program if Tompkins\u2019 demands were ignored.\n\nCCC documents reveal that Andrea Cabral, who proceeded Tompkins as Suffolk County Sheriff, was the CEO of Ascend Mass, LLC when the company sought its Boston dispensary license. Cabral has also served as the Secretary of Public Safety for Massachusetts.\n\nThe indictment doesn\u2019t mention Cabral or any other then-executives at Ascend.\n\nIn 2021, Tompkins was recorded in an interview with Cabral discussing the cannabis industry. During this conversation, Tompkins talked about the legality of marijuana, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s legal in many states, but not federally if I understand correctly.\u201d Cabral, who at the time was Ascend\u2019s CEO, responded, \u201cI\u2019m sure that it never should have been illegal federally, but that\u2019s a whole different story about wealth and power and how it\u2019s exercised.\u201d\n\n25 Investigates attempted to reach Ascend Wellness Holdings, one of its local board members, and Andrea Cabral for comment, but none responded to calls or emails.\n\nThis is a developing story. Check back for updates as more information becomes available.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW",
