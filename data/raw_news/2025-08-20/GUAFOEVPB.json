  "title": "Obama Applauds Newsom's California Redistricting Plan As 'Responsible' As Texas GOP Pushes New Maps",
  "description": "Barack Obama has expressed support for Gavin Newsom's approach to redistricting.",
  "content": "Former President Barack Obama has waded into states\u2019 efforts at rare mid-decade redistricting efforts, saying he agrees with California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s response to alter his state\u2019s congressional maps, in the way of Texas redistricting efforts promoted by President Donald Trump aimed at shoring up Republicans\u2019 position in next year\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cI believe that Gov. Newsom\u2019s approach is a responsible approach. He said this is going to be responsible. We\u2019re not going to try to completely maximize it,\u201d Obama said at a Tuesday fundraiser on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts, according to excerpts obtained by The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re only going to do it if and when Texas and/or other Republican states begin to pull these maneuvers. Otherwise, this doesn\u2019t go into effect.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that \u201cpolitical gerrymandering\u201d is not his \u201cpreference,\u201d Obama said that, if Democrats \u201cdon\u2019t respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop, because they do not appear to believe in this idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy.\u201d\n\nAccording to organizers, the event raised $2 million for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and its affiliates, one of which has filed and supported litigation in several states over GOP-drawn districts. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Eric Holder, who served as Obama\u2019s attorney general and heads up the group, also appeared.\n\nThe former president\u2019s comments come as Texas lawmakers return to Austin this week, renewing a heated debate over a new congressional map creating five new potential GOP seats. The plan is the result of prodding by President Donald Trump, eager to stave off a midterm defeat that would deprive his party of control of the House of Representatives. Texas Democratic lawmakers delayed a vote for 15 days by leaving the state in protest, depriving the House of enough members to do business.\n\nSpurred on by the Texas situation, Democratic governors including Newsom have pondered ways to possibly strengthen their party\u2019s position by way of redrawing U.S. House district lines, five years out from the Census count that typically leads into such procedures.\n\nIn California \u2014 where voters in 2010 gave the power to draw congressional maps to an independent commission, with the goal of making the process less partisan \u2014 Democrats have unveiled a proposal that could give that state\u2019s dominant political party an additional five U.S. House seats in a bid to win the fight to control of Congress next year. If approved by voters in November, the blueprint could nearly erase Republican House members in the nation\u2019s most populous state, with Democrats intending to win the party 48 of its 52 U.S. House seats, up from 43.\n\nA hearing over that measure devolved into a shouting match Tuesday as a Republican lawmaker clashed with Democrats, and a committee voted along party lines to advance the new congressional map. California Democrats do not need any Republican votes to move ahead, and legislators are expected to approve a proposed congressional map and declare a Nov. 4 special election by Thursday to get required voter approval.\n\nNewsom and Democratic leaders say they\u2019ll ask voters to approve their new maps only for the next few elections, returning map-drawing power to the commission following the 2030 census \u2014 and only if a Republican state moves forward with new maps. Obama applauded that temporary timeline.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to do it in a temporary basis because we\u2019re keeping our eye on where we want to be long term,\u201d Obama said, referencing Newsom\u2019s take on the California plan. \u201cI think that approach is a smart, measured approach, designed to address a very particular problem in a very particular moment in time.\u201d\n\nFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

      "text": "The next steps in California Democrats\u2019 plan to counter Texas Republicans\u2019 redistricting push\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California is the first Democratic-led state to wade into a brewing national redistricting fight after President Donald Trump urged Texas Republicans to draw new maps to maintain the party\u2019s slim U.S. House majority after the 2026 midterm elections.\nThe Texas plan was temporarily stalled when minority Democrats left the state to stop the Legislature from passing any bills, but some lawmakers said they\u2019ll return to Texas now that California is moving forward with its counter act.\nBoth parties hope to add five seats for their side.\nHere\u2019s what happens next in California:\nLegislative approval\nLawmakers will return to the Capitol on Monday after summer break and plan to immediately take up the partisan plan. State Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers \u2014 enough to act without any Republican votes \u2014 and Newsom has said he\u2019s not worried about winning the required support from two-thirds of lawmakers to advance the maps.\nLawmakers will hold hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday on a package of bills to establish the new congressional map, declare a Nov. 4 special election and authorize to reimburse local government for the costs. Elections committees in both houses are asking for public feedback on the proposed map, but it\u2019s unlikely any changes would be made after the bills are officially introduced Monday.\nAmendments to any legislation would require a 72-hour wait before a vote. That would jeopardize Democrats\u2019 plan to approve the package by Thursday to give elections officials enough time to prepare ballots for a statewide election in November. State leaders already have blown past deadlines designed to give local officials adequate time for organizing an election.\nSpecial elections are costly\nCalifornia sends every voter a mail-in ballot roughly a month before each election. That means local officials have less than two months to prepare and print ballots.\nThey\u2019re already preparing. On Friday, a coalition of county officials urged the Legislature to provide money in advance, because many counties are cash-strapped, and officials worry they won\u2019t have enough money to administer the election.\nA 2021 special election cost over $200 million to conduct. State Republicans this week estimated this year\u2019s would cost $235 million.\nDemocrats chose Nov. 4 for the election because Los Angeles County and others are already holding local elections that day.\nAn intense campaign\nNewsom is leading the campaign in favor of the maps. He and Democrats signaled Thursday they\u2019ll make the effort a referendum on Trump and tie it to the future of American democracy.\nPerhaps the most prominent opponent will be former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who championed the state\u2019s independent redistricting commission during his time in office. On Friday, he posted a photo of himself lifting weights on social media wearing a T-shirt that called to \u201cterminate gerrymandering,\u201d a nod to his role in the \u201cTerminator\u201d movies.\nRepublican donor Charles Munger Jr., who spent tens of millions to support the California ballot initiative that gives redistricting power to an independent commission, also plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d nonpartisan redistricting, his spokesperson said.\nState Republicans say the move is a power grab by Democrats and some have vowed to go to court.\nSteve Hilton, a Republican candidate for governor, earlier this month paid for a legal opinion that says redistricting outside of the normal process and cycle violates the California Constitution. The new map wouldn\u2019t be fair because state lawmakers are relying on outdated population data, he said.\nCommon Cause, a good governance group that supports independent redistricting, initially opposed California\u2019s effort but this week reversed its stance. The group said it won\u2019t challenge partisan redistricting in California if the effort is approved by voters, among other criteria.\nA temporary change\nCalifornia voters in 2010 gave the power to draw congressional maps to an independent commission, with the goal of making the process less partisan. The commission last redrew maps following the 2020 census, and the maps were in place for the 2022 and 2024 U.S. House elections.\nNewsom and Democratic leaders say they\u2019ll ask voters to approve their new maps only for the next few elections. They say they\u2019ll return map-drawing power to the commission following the 2030 census.\nThe new map would take effect only if a Republican state moves forward with new maps."

      "text": "Trump tells Texas Republicans to redraw the state congressional map to help keep House majority\nTrump tells Texas Republicans to redraw the state congressional map to help keep House majority\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he is pushing Texas Republicans to redraw the state\u2019s congressional maps to create more House seats favorable to his party, part of a broader effort to help the GOP retain control of the chamber in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nThe president\u2019s directive signals part of the strategy Trump is likely to take to avoid a repeat of his first term, when Democrats flipped the House just two years into his presidency. It comes shortly before the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature is scheduled to begin a special session next week during which it will consider new congressional maps to further marginalize Democrats in the state.\nAsked as he departed the White House for Pittsburgh about the possibility of adding GOP-friendly districts around the country, Trump responded, \u201cTexas will be the biggest one. And that\u2019ll be five.\u201d\nTrump had a call earlier Tuesday with members of Texas\u2019 Republican congressional delegation and told them the state Legislature would pursue five new winnable seats through redistricting, according to a person familiar the call who was not authorized to discuss it. The call was first reported by Punchbowl News.\nSome Texas Republicans have been hesitant about redrawing the maps because there\u2019s only so many new seats a party can grab before its incumbents are put at risk. Republicans gain new seats by relocating Democratic voters out of competitive areas and into other GOP-leaning ones, which may then turn competitive with the influx.\n\u201cThere comes the point where you slice the baloney too thin and it backfires,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nDemocrats will have a hard time retaliating\nCongressional maps drawn after the 2020 census were expected to remain in place through the end of the decade. If Texas redraws them at the behest of Trump, that could lead other states to do the same, including those controlled by Democrats. In response to the Texas plan, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on social media: \u201cTwo can play this game.\u201d\nStill, Democrats may have their hands at least partly tied. Many of the states the party controls have their state legislative and congressional maps drawn by independent commissions that are not supposed to favor either party. That\u2019s the case in California, where Newsom has no role in the redistricting game after voters approved the commission system with a 2008 ballot initiative.\nNewsom on Tuesday afternoon floated the notion of California\u2019s Democratic-controlled Legislature doing a mid-decade redistricting and arguing it wouldn\u2019t be expressly forbidden by the 2008 ballot initiative. Democrats already hold 43 of the state\u2019s 52 House seats. He also proposed squeezing in a special election to repeal the popular commission system before the 2026 elections get underway, but either would be an extraordinary long shot.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a whole lot Democrats can do right now,\u201d said Michael Li of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cIn terms of doing tit-for-tat, they\u2019ve got a weaker hand.\u201d\nLi noted that Democrats are backing lawsuits to overturn some GOP-drawn maps, and there\u2019s a chance some of those could be successful before the midterm elections. That includes in Wisconsin, where the new liberal majority on the state supreme court declined to immediately overturn the state\u2019s GOP-drawn congressional maps earlier this year. Democrats and their allies have filed suit in a lower court hoping to beat the clock and get new maps in place by next year.\nDemocrats also have litigation in Utah and Florida.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court is considering a case out of Louisiana that seeks to unravel one majority Black district mandated by the Voting Rights Act. The case could lead to sweeping changes in longstanding rules requiring mapmakers to ensure that racial minorities get a chance to be an electoral majority or plurality in some areas.\nThe high court is expected to rule in that case by next summer.\nRe-opening maps undermines \u2018free and fair elections\u2019\nRedistricting is a constitutionally mandated process for redrawing political districts after the once-a-decade census to ensure they have equal populations. But there is no prohibition against rejiggering maps between censuses, and sometimes court rulings have made that mandatory. The wave of voluntary mid-decade redistricting that Trump is encouraging, however, is unusual.\nIt\u2019s also left some Democrats fuming that their party has ceded much its mapmaking power to independent commissions in states it controls, including Colorado, Michigan and Washington.\n\u201cReformers often do not understand the importance of political power,\u201d said Rick Ridder, a Democratic strategist in Denver.\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries wouldn\u2019t comment on whether nonpartisan systems should be rolled back, instead saying Trump\u2019s push will \u201cundermine free and fair elections.\u201d\n\u201cPublic servants should earn the votes of the people that they hope to represent. What Republicans are trying to do in Texas is to have politicians choose their voters,\u201d Jeffries told reporters.\nDemocratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, whose district includes part of Austin, also criticized Texas Republicans for focusing on redistricting after floods killed at least 132 people, and with more still missing.\n\u201cRedistricting, this scheme, is an act of desperation,\u201d he said.\nTexas lawmakers will consider a new map during special session\nThe special Texas legislative session scheduled to start Monday is intended to focus primarily on the aftermath of the deadly floods.\nAn agenda for the session set by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott put forth plans to take up \u201clegislation that provides a revised congressional redistricting plan in light of constitutional concerns raised by the U.S. Department of Justice.\u201d\nRepublicans in Ohio also are poised to redraw their maps after years of political and court battles over the state\u2019s redistricting process. The GOP-controlled Legislature is considering expanding the party\u2019s lead in the congressional delegation to as much as 13-2. It currently has a 10-5 advantage.\nStill, there are practical limits as to how many new seats any party can squeeze from a map. That\u2019s why some Texas Republicans have been hesitant about another redraw. In 2011, the party\u2019s legislators drew an aggressive map to expand their majority, only to find seats they thought were safe washed away in the 2018 Democratic wave election during Trump\u2019s first term.\nIn response, the map in 2021 was drawn more cautiously, mainly preserving the GOP\u2019s current outsized majority in its congressional delegation. There are 25 Republican House members from the state compared to 12 Democrats and one Democratic vacancy that is scheduled to be filled by a special election. A five-seat shift into the GOP column would mean the party holds 30 of Texas\u2019 38 seats after winning 56% of the vote in last year\u2019s presidential election.\nBoth parties see potential advantages\nIn Austin, Republican lawmakers said they embrace the opportunity to redraw maps.\nState Rep. Brian Harrison, who served in the first Trump administration, said lawmakers can do it in a way that\u2019s \u201cthoughtful and constructive.\u201d\n\u201cThis is something that we can do, and something that we should do,\u201d\nGOP Texas Sen. John Cornyn said he expects a new map will lead to \u201csignificant gains,\u201d in part because Latino voters have been trending toward Republicans in recent elections.\nBut Rep. Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Tuesday that there was no way to redraw the boundaries without exposing more GOP incumbents to a possible Democratic wave. When a party wins the White House, it usually loses seats in the midterms.\n\u201cAny new map that Texas Republicans draw will almost inevitably create more competitive districts,\u201d DelBene told reporters. \u201cThis scheme to rig the maps is hardly going to shore up their majority. It is going to expand the battleground in the race for the majority.\u201d\n___\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of the name of the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n___\nAssociated Press Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro in Washington and writers Nadia Lathan in Austin, Texas, and Julie Carr Smyth in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this report."

Democrats are readying a fight\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House is eyeing redistricting efforts beyond Texas to help Republicans hold the U.S. House in 2026 \u2014 and Democrats are preparing to escalate in response, with one senator vowing to go \u201cnuclear\u201d if needed.\nWhat\u2019s shaping up to be a multistate redistricting battle could mark the opening round for House control ahead of next year\u2019s midterms, when Democrats see retaking the House as the party\u2019s best chance to break Republicans\u2019 hold on Congress and President Donald Trump is determined to keep the GOP\u2019s majority. Democrats, under pressure from their base to match GOP tactics, have grown more forceful in their messaging and are taking concrete steps to push back, even as the party enters at a disadvantage.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re going to go nuclear, then so am I,\u201d said Sen. Elissa Slotkin. \u201cThey\u2019re forcing us into this position because they\u2019re trying to pick their voters.\u201d\nAt Trump\u2019s urging, Texas Republicans are looking to redraw congressional maps to favor GOP candidates during a 30-day special legislative session that started this week. Trump has said he wants to carve out five new winnable GOP seats.\nBut Trump officials are now going beyond just Texas, looking to redraw lines in other states such as Missouri, according to a person familiar with conversations but unauthorized to speak publicly about them.\nDemocrats have fewer options. More of the states the party controls do not allow elected partisans to draw maps, instead entrusting groups such as independent commissions to draw fair lines.\nStill, party leaders are exploring their legal options and shifting their posture. A party long known for believing it\u2019s on the moral high ground is signaling it\u2019s ready to fight dirty.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t fight with one hand behind our backs,\u201d Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, told reporters Tuesday.\nDemocrats explore their own redistricting map plans\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries may have fewer options to match Republicans, but it hasn\u2019t stopped him from exploring them.\nEarlier this month, Jeffries\u2019 team spoke with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s office about redistricting after the news in Texas, according to a person familiar with the conversations. Drawing new congressional lines now could run afoul of the state constitution and undoubtedly draw legal challenges \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t appear to be off the table.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m going to say is, all is fair in love and war,\u201d Hochul said Thursday, adding that she\u2019s \u201cgoing to see what our options are.\u201d\n\u201cIf there\u2019s other states that are violating the rules that are going to try and give themselves an advantage, all I\u2019ll say is I\u2019m going to look at it closely with Hakeem Jeffries.\u201d\nJeffries and his advisers have also examined legal strategies in other states with Democratic trifectas, including California, where he recently met with the state\u2019s congressional delegation.\nOn Wednesday, the California delegation\u2019s Democrats discussed the redistricting issue during a private meeting on Capitol Hill. And on Thursday, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi joined an emergency call with others in the state about the effort.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Pelosi said that she is not a fan of using redistricting outside of the 10-year window, but if that\u2019s what the party needs \u201cto win, we will do that.\u201d\n\u201cEverything is on the table,\u201d Pelosi told AP.\nCalifornia\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic contender for president in 2028, has taken a similar approach. He said on social media in response to Trump\u2019s redistricting push that \u201ctwo can play this game.\u201d\nAn independent commission handles redistricting in his state. Newsom has floated the notion of California\u2019s Democratic-controlled legislature doing a mid-decade redistricting, arguing it wouldn\u2019t be expressly forbidden by the 2008 ballot initiative that created the commission. He\u2019s also mentioned the possibility of squeezing in a special election to repeal the popular commission system before the 2026 elections get underway, either of which would be a long shot.\nDemocrats see redistricting fight as an avenue to push back\nBeyond the behind-the-scenes maneuvering, Democrats see the redistricting fight as an opportunity to meet the moment politically \u2014 delivering the kind of aggressive pushback their voters have demanded.\nArizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, in a series of social media posts, pushed Democrats to fight back, saying the party should \u201cgerrymander to help Democrats\u201d and arguing they should dilute heavily Democratic districts to secure more seats \u201ceverywhere.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Democrats to understand the existential threat. Republicans aren\u2019t playing around and they will do this as long as it takes to keep power,\u201d he warned.\nGallego later told The Associated Press it\u2019s simply about ensuring \u201cthat we\u2019re also fighting back.\u201d\nThat sentiment has gained traction beyond Congress. Former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said Sunday on CNN that Democrats need to be \u201cto be absolutely ruthless about getting back in power.\u201d\nNext month, former President Barack Obama is heading to Martha\u2019s Vineyard for a fundraiser benefiting the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group whose nonprofit affiliate has filed and supported litigation in several states over GOP-drawn districts. Eric Holder, Obama\u2019s former attorney general who chairs the outfit, is expected to attend, along with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, according to a copy of the invitation first reported by Politico.\nIn a statement to AP, Marina Jenkins, executive director of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, called Republicans\u2019 moves \u201ccheating,\u201d adding that the group would be \u201cusing every single tool at our disposal to fight back and stop Donald Trump\u2019s scheme to steal the 2026 midterm elections from voters.\u201d\nIn addition to fundraisers like the one featuring Obama next month, that tool kit includes the group and its affiliates focusing on organizing volunteers and donors around the special Texas session. They also make media appearances and craft digital campaigns to highlight their arguments.\nRedrawing maps could be risky for GOP\nRedrawing of congressional maps holds risks. During the 2010s, Texas\u2019 GOP-controlled Legislature redrew the congressional map to bolster the party\u2019s majority. But the advantage proved short-lived: in 2018, a backlash to Trump\u2019s presidency helped Democrats flip two seats that Republicans had assumed were safely red.\n\u201cThere had to be folks that drew these lines and everything that had a very strong opinion of exactly where they ought to be,\u201d said West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, a Republican. \u201cNow just to say, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to redraw this, we\u2019re going to redraw that. And by god, if you\u2019re going to redraw, we\u2019re going to redraw.\u2019 I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\nMissouri Sen. Josh Hawley said Thursday that he has not yet spoken to any Republicans in his state about redistricting but that it\u2019s up to the Missouri legislature and governor to make the call.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to have more Republicans,\u201d Hawley said.\n___\nLisa Mascaro in Washington and Anthony Izaguirre in Albany, N.Y., contributed to this report.\n___\nKinnard reported from Chapin, S.C., and can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP"

      "text": "Democratic group sues over Ohio GOP\u2019s new congressional map\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio\u2019s newly drawn map of congressional districts was hit with its first constitutional challenge, which alleges the boundaries represent partisan gerrymandering by Republicans.\nThe lawsuit was filed Monday in Ohio Supreme Court by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee\u2019s legal arm on behalf of a group of Ohio voters.\nIts legal action challenges a final map of U.S. House districts that sprinted through the Ohio Statehouse last week, passing without Democratic support and going on to be signed Saturday by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. Because it lacked support from Democrats, the map will hold for just four years, rather than the typical 10.\nThe lawsuit contends the map leans 12-3 in favor of Republicans, though the GOP describes it as 6-2, with the remaining seven districts being competitive.\nThe plan is \u201ceven more rigged than its predecessor and an outlier among partisan gerrymanders nationwide,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201dTo achieve this remarkable result, the map-drawers subordinated traditional redistricting criteria, tore communities of interest apart, and diluted the voting power of Black Ohioans.\u201d\nCommittee Chair Eric Holder, attorney general under former President Barack Obama, said in a statement that the map is \u201can insult to Ohioans,\u201d who overwhelming supported redistricting reform in 2015 and 2018.\nRepublicans, who controlled the mapmaking process, assert the map is fair, constitutional, competitive and does not unduly favor either political party or its incumbents.\n\u201cWhen compared to the other proposals offered from House and Senate caucuses, both Republican and Democrat, the map in SB 258 makes the most progress to produce a fair, compact, and competitive map,\u201d DeWine said in a signing statement.\nThe NDRC\u2019s suit targets DeWine and the other members of the Ohio Redistricting Commission, rather than state lawmakers who ultimately okayed the map. Voters empowered the commission with a potentially pivotal role in approving Ohio\u2019s legislative and congressional district maps. It missed its deadline for approving a congressional map without taking a vote."

      "text": "Democrats release plan to boost party\u2019s California US House seats in fight for Congress\nDemocrats release plan to boost party\u2019s California US House seats in fight for Congress\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 In a display of cutthroat yet calculated politics, Democrats unveiled a proposal Friday that could give California\u2019s dominant political party an additional five U.S. House seats in a bid to win the fight to control of Congress next year.\nThe plan calls for an unusually timed reshaping of House district lines to greatly strengthen the Democratic advantage in the state ahead of midterm elections, when Republicans will be defending a fragile majority.\nIt amounts to a counterpunch to Texas, where the GOP is trying to add five seats to its House delegation at the urging of President Donald Trump as he tries to avoid losing control of Congress and, with it, prospects for his conservative agenda in the later part of his term.\nIf approved by voters in November, the California blueprint could nearly erase Republican House members in the nation\u2019s most populous state. The Democratic plan is intended to win the party 48 of its 52 U.S. House seats, up from 43.\nThe campaign arm of House Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, released the maps Friday, and the Democratic-led Legislature later posted them online. State lawmakers plan to hold hearings and vote on the new maps next week.\n\u201cThis is about more than drawing lines on a map. It\u2019s about drawing a line in the sand to stop Texas and Trump from rigging the election,\u201d state Senate Democratic leader Mike McGuire said in a statement.\nNew districts have boundaries to boost Democratic edge\nWhile a general notion behind drawing districts is to unite what\u2019s called communities of interest \u2014 neighborhoods and cities that share similar concerns or demographic traits \u2014 the proposed remapping would create a jigsaw of oddly shaped districts to maximize Democratic clout.\nThe 1st Congressional District is currently anchored in the state\u2019s conservative far northeast corner and is represented by Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Trump supporter. The district has a nearly 18-point GOP registration edge.\nUnder the proposal, Democrats would end up with a 10-point registration advantage there after drastic reshaping to include parts of heavily Democratic Sonoma County near the Pacific Coast.\nIn a post on the social platform X, LaMalfa called the proposal \u201cabsolutely ridiculous.\u201d\nIn the battleground 41st District east of Los Angeles, home to long-serving Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, Democratic and Republican registration is currently split about evenly.\nBut in the redrawn district, Democratic registration would jump to 46% with GOP registration falling to 26%.\nOther Republicans whose districts would see major changes intended to favor Democrats include Reps. Kevin Kiley in Northern California, David Valadao in the Central Valley farm belt and Darrell Issa in San Diego County. Also, embattled Democratic incumbents would see their districts padded with additional left-leaning voters.\nNewsom promises fight with Trump\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that his state will hold a Nov. 4 special referendum on the redrawn districts.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,\u201d Newsom said.\nThe announcement marked the first time any state beyond Texas officially waded into Trump\u2019s fight, though several governors and legislative leaders from both parties have threatened such moves.\nRep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who heads the House GOP campaign arm, accused Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, of \u201cshredding California\u2019s Constitution and disenfranchising voters.\u201d\n\u201cCalifornians oppose Newsom\u2019s stunt because they won\u2019t let a self-serving politician rig the system to further his career,\u201d said Hudson, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee.\nThe looming question: How will voters react?\nA big risk for Democrats is whether voters will be open to setting aside district boundaries crafted by an independent commission for ones shaped for partisan advantage.\nSome people already have said they would sue over the effort. Republican former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime opponent of partisan redistricting, signaled that he will not side with Democrats even after talking to Newsom. He posted a photo of himself Friday at the gym wearing a T-shirt that said, \u201cTerminate gerrymandering.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting ready for the gerrymandering battle,\u201d Schwarzenegger said.\nWhat\u2019s next in Texas?\nThe release of the plan came the same day that Texas Republicans began a second special session to approve new congressional maps sought by Trump.\nThe first special session ended without approving new maps, thwarted by Democrats who staged a nearly two-week walkout that meant not enough lawmakers were present to pass any legislation. Gov. Greg Abbott then called a second session that started without the necessary quorum to conduct business.\nAbsent lawmakers have said they will return to Austin once California Democrats take more formal steps on their own redistricting plan.\nTrump is trying to avoid a repeat of the 2018 midterms, when the GOP yielded control during his first presidency to a Democratic majority that stymied his agenda and twice impeached him. The nation\u2019s two most populous states have been at the forefront of the resulting battle, which has reached into multiple courtrooms and statehouses controlled by both parties.\nTexas House Speaker Dustin Burrows chided colleagues who left Austin, accusing them of \u201cfollowing Gov. Newsom\u2019s lead instead of the will of Texans.\u201d The speaker said, however, that he has \u201cbeen told\u201d to expect a quorum Monday.\nHouse control could come down to a few seats in 2026\nOn a national level, the partisan makeup of existing district lines puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. Of the 435 total seats, only several dozen districts are competitive. So even slight changes in a few states could affect which party wins control.\nNew maps are typically drawn once a decade after the census \u2014 the last being in 2020. Many states, including Texas, give legislators the power to draw maps. California is among those that empower independent commissions with the task.\n___\nNguy\u1ec5n reported from Sacramento, Blood from Los Angeles and Barrow from Atlanta.
