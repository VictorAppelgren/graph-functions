      "feedback": "The draft is a solid, first‑principles view of U.S. mortgage rates, but it currently fails the acceptance gate because it does not map to a canonical handle and lacks an explicit catalyst window.  Add a sentence that links the 30‑year fixed‑rate mortgage to the UST 10‑year yield (e.g., “Mortgage rates move in tandem with UST 10y, which is the nearest canonical proxy”), and insert a short catalyst block: “Key catalysts: Fed policy meeting 16‑17 Sept 2025 (federal funds rate & balance‑sheet stance), core CPI release 1 Oct 2025 (inflation expectations), Treasury yield change Q4 2025 (debt‑driven supply), and monthly mortgage‑origination data (loan demand).”  Keep the causal chain intact, preserve the 6.5‑7 % range, and maintain the base‑case, risk, watch‑points and confidence.  No sentences drift from the mortgage‑rate focus.",
