      "feedback": "Your draft is too verbose for a 4–6‑sentence executive brief, lacks a clear causal link to the canonical handle (ust10y), and omits explicit magnitude, catalyst windows, and watch signals. Condense into 6 concise sentences (or bullets) that: 1) state the current 30‑yr rate (6.548 %) and its 2.3 pp excess over ust10y, citing LF0UUL917; 2) explain that a Fed‑accelerated cut compresses the real‑rate differential and term premium, allowing a 50–100 bp fall over 12–18 mo, citing LF0UUL917; 3) note that persistent inflation or rising debt‑to‑GDP could widen the term premium and lift rates to 7–7.5 % by 2027, citing LF0UUL917; 4) list medium‑term catalysts (Sept 2025 & Mar 2026 FOMC, Apr & Oct 2025 CPI, Treasury issuance, Fed asset‑sale pace) with a single citation; 5) enumerate risks (25 bp Fed cut in Q4 2025 → 75–100 bp drop, 0.5 % YoY inflation cut compressing the term premium, 10 % YoY mortgage‑demand surge tightening credit spreads) citing LF0UUL917; 6) state watch signals (Fed minutes, CPI/PCE, Treasury yield curves, mortgage‑originating bank credit spreads) and confidence as moderate, citing LF0UUL917. Ensure every claim has an inline citation, the sign/magnitude is explicit, and the brief stays within the 4–6 sentence limit.",
