  "description": "In an era where digital evidence determines legal outcomes, whether you are prepared determines the future of your business.",
  "content": "As a business leader, you may pay attention to cybersecurity, backup systems, and data protection. But there\u2019s a critical blind spot: When a security incident, legal dispute, or regulatory investigation occurs, your ability to recover and present digital evidence could determine whether your company survives the crisis or faces devastating legal, financial, and reputational consequences.\n\nDigital forensics and data recovery aren\u2019t just IT concerns; they\u2019re executive-level risk management imperatives that can protect your intellectual property, reduce legal exposure, and preserve your company\u2019s reputation. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science. It includes the collection, investigation, examination, and analysis of material found in digital devices. The evidence is then used for legal decision-making in matters of criminal and civil law. Data recovery technology is the heart of the digital forensics practice. Let\u2019s discuss how it is used in digital forensics and why it is important for business leaders to understand.\n\nIn digital forensics, it is often difficult for investigators to get the complete, intact, and ready-to-use data from digital devices. Instead, most of the time, they face hidden, deleted, or damaged information. Different from traditional physical evidence, digital evidence is extremely volatile. When users delete a file, format a drive, or empty the recycle bin, the data will disappear from the file system.\n\nAlso, in many cases, criminals may destroy evidence on purpose, including deleting files and communication records, reformatting the disk or reinstalling the operating system, physically damaging storage devices, and using professional data wiping tools. For the above scenarios, data recovery is required. Moreover, the purpose of digital forensics is to reconstruct a complete event timeline and behavioral pattern by obtaining the following data:\n\u2022 Temporary files and cache data generated by systems and applications\n\u2022 Meta information, including file creation, modification, and access time, Zone.Identifier in NTFS file stream, etc.\n\u2022 Fragmented data, including partially damaged or incomplete file fragments, email fragments in Outlook PST files, etc. These data are normally not available to general users, so data recovery technology is needed to obtain them (full disclosure: DataNumen offers this solution). Most of the general data recovery techniques can be used in digital forensics as well, including:\n\u2022 Hardware-level (physical) recovery that utilizes specialized devices or environments to extract data.\n\u2022 Software-level (logical) recovery, including raw-level recovery that uses file-carving technology and file system metadata to recover lost or deleted files, and file-level recovery that repairs corrupted files. Moreover, there are some specialized techniques used in digital forensics only:\n\u2022 Forensic imaging with write-blocking: NIST forbids any modifications to evidence drives. Therefore, before starting to recover data from devices, a writing-block device should be used to make a bit-for-bit image of the original device.\n\u2022 Memory forensics: Volatile data in memory is also important evidence. Memory forensics uses specialized techniques to dump and analyze these transient data, including running processes, network connections, encryption keys, and other information.\n\u2022 Integrity: The evidence must be complete without any omissions.\n\u2022 Originality: The evidence must be obtained in its original state without any changes. Hash verification is commonly used for this purpose.\n\u2022 Verifiability: The acquisition process of the evidence must be verifiable and reproducible.\n\u2022 Chain of custody: Every transfer of evidence, from initial seizure to imaging to the final analysis, must be recorded and signed by the person in charge to make sure they are fully under control. Therefore, investigators must follow these requirements when performing data recovery:\n\u2022 Some special techniques, including those mentioned above, will be used for this purpose.\n\u2022 The data recovery software and hardware should also follow these requirements. Courts are increasingly expecting NIST CFTT or SWGDE test results for these tools. Improper evidence handling can destroy your case before it begins. As a leader, ensure your legal and IT teams understand these requirements. WHY THIS MATTERS TO YOUR BUSINESS\n\nEvery day, your organization generates digital evidence that could be crucial in legal disputes, regulatory investigations, or intellectual property theft cases. Consider the potential costs of the cases, such as failed litigation due to incomplete evidence, regulatory fines for inability to produce required records, or loss of trade secrets because you couldn\u2019t prove theft occurred. The executives who understand these risks\u2014and prepare accordingly\u2014can protect their companies from potentially catastrophic exposure.\n\nBelow are some examples of how data recovery can be used in legal cases and how business leaders can apply these lessons to protect their organizations. Imagine investigators using data recovery techniques to restore deleted financial statements. By analyzing freed spaces on the company\u2019s hard drive, they uncover earlier versions of these statements containing evidence of money laundering activities.",

The goal of the Computer Forensic Tool Testing (CFTT) project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is to establish a methodology for testing computer forensic software tools by development of general tool specifications, test procedures, test criteria, test sets, and test hardware. The results provide the information necessary for toolmakers to improve tools, for users to make informed choices about acquiring and using computer forensics tools, and for interested parties to understand the tools capabilities. A capability is required to ensure that forensic software tools consistently produce accurate and objective test results. Our approach for testing computer forensic tools is based on well-recognized international methodologies for conformance testing and quality testing.\nThe Computer Forensics Tool Testing Program is a project in The Software and Systems Division supported by the Special Programs Office and the Department of Homeland Security. Through the Cyber Security Division Cyber Forensics project, the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology partners with the NIST CFTT project to provide forensic tool testing reports to the public.\nNEW: Federated Testing -- Guidance for common test methods & test report sharing via downloaded CD iso is available."
