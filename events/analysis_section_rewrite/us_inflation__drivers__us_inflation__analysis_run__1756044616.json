      "feedback": "The draft provides a solid base-case Regime A and a plausible policy transmission, but its world-class potential hinges on tightly integrating the S&P 500 influencers (MSFT Azure growth +39%, Q4 rev +18%; Shopify revenue growth +31% and GMV share >12% of US e-commerce) into a explicit, first‑principles chain from platform breadth to GMV, revenue, margins and cash flow, with numeric anchors rather than qualitative hedges; it should also reconcile oil dynamics (IEA’s 2.5 mbpd supply rise in 2025) with inflation/rate expectations, and treat US-Chinese tariff dynamics as a contingent but clearly signaled risk rather than a sidelined tail risk; in addition to sharpening the narrative, present a formal 2–3 scenario framework (base/positive AI-capex accelerant/bull case and inflation/shock bear case) with explicit trigger levels (Fed communications ahead of Sep; 10Y yield breaches of mid-4% and its tolerance band; oil-supply/demand surprises; tariff renewal beyond 90 days) and concrete implications for AI/tech capex, platform monetization, margins, and equity valuations; increase citation precision by tying all quantitative claims to IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL (or clearly annotate when figures are from the S&P 500 influences block) and reuse those IDs consistently; expand coverage to floor‑level cross-topic links (US urban dynamics and consumer demand risk, tariff trajectory, energy inflation sensitivity) so the narrative isn’t oil- or tariff‑alone; deliver a tighter, two-paragraph structure or a single compact paragraph with a clear base-case verdict and a one-line watchlist, ensuring numbers drive the chain (e.g., Shopify GMV/Rev trajectory, MSFT/Azure strength, IEA supply delta, tariff pause impact) rather than generic statements.",
