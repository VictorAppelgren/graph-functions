  "title": "Revealed: The most scandalous - and funniest - Mad Mondays in the AFL",
  "description": "Here's why the mere mention of the words 'Mad Monday' sends shivers down the spines of officials at AFL clubs.",
  "content": "After years of scandals, the mere mention of the words 'Mad Monday' is enough to send shivers down the spine of the media teams at any AFL club.\n\nWhile some celebrations go off without a hitch and see footy stars enjoy a few drinks and a bit of fancy dress, the end-of-season parties have a dark side that has spawned stacks of controversies over the years \u2013 and even umpires aren't immune to the fallout.\n\nHere are some of the wildest, most controversial, and hilarious moments to come out of AFL Mad Monday celebrations in the modern era.\n\nStar gets dumped by his girlfriend in spectacular fashion\n\nBeing the partner of a footy player can be tough, as former Footscray ruckman Simon Atkins (pictured above) knows all too well. After the Bulldogs lost the 1992 qualifying final, there were no costumes or flair about their Mad Monday celebrations \u2013 just two days straight of solid contemplation and drinking.\n\nThat was too much for his girlfriend Shannon, who had all of his belongings and an eviction notice delivered to Melbourne's Albert Hotel, where the players were drowning their sorrows.\n\n'I think that will work itself out, though,' he laughed when asked about the delivery by media.\n\n'It's a bit of a joke, I think. I hope.'\n\nJason Akermanis gets barred from the Brownlow Medal\n\nAkermanis revealed that after a particularly heavy Mad Monday, he was in no condition to front up at the 2009 Brownlow Medal count, and his wife Megan sensibly told him to stay home.\n\nWhen critics accused Megan of being a 'princess' for the couple's no-show, Akermanis fired back, saying she had no desire for attention and was only trying to save him from embarrassment.\n\nHe explained that Megan was actually very understanding about the whole situation, insisting that she never seeks the spotlight and simply wanted what was best for him.\n\nWhile Megan was left disappointed about returning her designer gown and letting down the people who had helped her prepare for footy's night of nights, she joked that she would just keep it in the cupboard for the following year.\n\nAkermanis, meanwhile, was pleased to at least get the chance to wear his new 'Oceans 13-inspired' Soho Workshop suit on The Footy Show's Grand Final edition later that week.\n\nBrendan Fevola courts controversy twice during his heady days\n\nBrendan Fevola cemented his reputation for outrageous Mad Monday antics when he chose Melbourne's busiest pedestrian intersection to stage a stunt in a nightie with a sex toy stuffed in his pants in 2008.\n\nThe former Carlton and Brisbane forward shocked and offended passers-by as he strutted near Flinders Street Station, holding a beer and proudly displaying the plastic prop.\n\nThe controversy didn't end there. A year later, the same toy made a return appearance during another Carlton pub crawl.\n\nFevola, clearly intoxicated, was photographed at Naughton's Hotel swinging the sex toy above his head as fellow players partied around him.\n\nPatrons complained about the behaviour of several Blues footballers, adding to the fallout and scrutiny around the club's culture at the time.\n\nJimmy Bartel sparked controversy in 2011 when he turned up to Mad Monday dressed as the infamous 'St Kilda Schoolgirl' Kim Duthie, complete with a jumper featuring her initials.\n\nHe arrived hand-in-hand with teammate Mitch Duncan, who took the joke further by appearing in his underwear to mimic disgraced player manager Ricky Nixon.\n\nThe costumes referenced a scandal that had rocked the AFL, when Duthie leaked nude photos of St Kilda players and Nixon was caught visiting her in a hotel room.\n\nThe skit drew sharp criticism, with Geelong MP Ian Trezise calling it inappropriate and AFL legend Ron Barassi declaring it lacked class and taste.\n\nBartel, however, defended the choice, insisting it was meant as light-hearted fun after a long season and that he hoped people would see it as a harmless joke.\n\nSt Kilda midfielder Clinton Jones was fined $3000 after setting dwarf entertainer Blake Johnston's clothes alight during Mad Monday celebrations in South Melbourne.\n\nThe 2013 incident occurred while Johnston was speaking to another player, with Jones using a gas lighter to ignite his clothing.\n\nJohnston later confirmed he had received apologies from both Jones and the St Kilda Football Club, as well as the AFL.\n\nHe said he accepted the apology and would not be pursuing further action, adding that Jones had offered to donate to a charity of Johnston's choosing, the Kids with Cancer Foundation Australia.\n\nJones publicly expressed regret, admitting his behaviour was 'childish' and describing the act as an error of judgment.\n\nMelbourne Demons Dean Terlich and Alex Georgiou were sanctioned by the club for dressing up as Rolf Harris and a young girl for their 2014 Mad Monday celebrations.\n\nHarris was convicted as a child sex offender that year, leaving then-coach Paul Roos incredulous over their choice of costumes\n\n'I was just speechless [when informed about the outfits]. I just don't understand it,' he said.\n\n'The problem with days like yesterday is they just don't think. There is no malice, there's no intent, there's just no thought process goes into it and I think that is the worst part about it.\n\n'Some people take the view boys will be boys, I don't take that view, it's just unacceptable.'\n\nIn 2015, Richmond star Dustin Martin became embroiled in controversy after allegations surfaced from the Tigers' Mad Monday celebrations.\n\nReports claimed Martin had been involved in an incident in which he was filmed groping a topless woman during the post-season party.\n\nThe story quickly gained traction in the media, sparking outrage and prompting questions about the culture surrounding end-of-season festivities.\n\nAt the time, the AFL was under pressure to address off-field behaviour, and the claims against Martin intensified the scrutiny.\n\nRichmond confirmed they were aware of the allegations but no charges were laid, and the matter did not progress legally.\n\nMartin was also cleared of any wrongdoing by the AFL.\n\nIn 2022, Western Bulldogs premiership defender Zaine Cordy made headlines for an incident that quickly went viral.\n\nOutside a Melbourne pub, Cordy was spotted in a wobbly state before being 'carried' and put in a taxi by mates to make sure he got home safely.\n\nVideo footage captured him staggering and needing support, with onlookers laughing as the Bulldogs big man was bundled into the back seat.\n\nSocial media erupted, with fans and commentators dubbing it one of the funnier off-season footy moments rather than a scandal.\n\nThe club was quick to downplay the drama, saying there was no suggestion of illegal behaviour or serious misconduct.\n\nCordy, known as a laid-back character in the Dogs' ranks, took the ribbing in good humour.\n\nJeremy Cameron is about as bush kid as they come. So when Geelong won the premiership in 2022, he decided to take the celebrations back to his rural Victorian property.\n\nAt some point, he thought it would be a good idea to hang his premiership medal around the neck of one of his cows.\n\n'We've done something very silly here,' he posted at around 4am.\n\n'Umm, can I have my medal back\u2026?\n\n'Let him have it for the night. Get out there, enjoy it, it's for all of us,' he slurred as the cow ran free into the night.\n\nGetting it back proved problematic, but Cameron had it sorted.\n\nDespite little sleep, Cameron fronted the Cats' supporters day at Kardinia Park on the following Sunday, medal safely around his neck after an early-morning wrangle.\n\n'I don't know who came up with the idea,' he said on stage.\n\nFresh from demolishing Sydney in the 2022 grand final, the Cats leaned into the constant jibes about being too old to win the premiership by turning the joke on themselves.\n\nStar players hobbled into the pub for Mad Monday with walking frames and mobility scooters, while others wore grey wigs, cardigans and slippers.\n\nTom Hawkins, Patrick Dangerfield and Joel Selwood were among those who embraced the gag, drawing roars of laughter from fans and cameras waiting outside.\n\nThe theme was a cheeky nod to critics who claimed the Cats were too far past it to win another flag, and the stunt turned into a viral hit.\n\nGWS push the boundaries too far\n\nSimply moving Mad Monday to a different day is not a licence to do what you please, as GWS found out in 2024.\n\nThirteen GWS Giants players were sanctioned by the AFL following a controversial post-season 'Wacky Wednesday' party that had a 'Controversial Couples' theme.\n\nYoung midfielder Josh Fahey received the harshest penalty, a four-game suspension, after he dressed as NRL star Jarryd Hayne and performed a skit with a blow-up doll.\n\nJake Riccardi was banned for two games for appearing as a taxi driver alongside Fahey, while Toby McMullin and Cooper Hamilton were also given two-game suspensions after they staged a skit that mocked the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nHarvey Thomas and Joe Fonti were handed the same penalty after they acted out a routine where Thomas dressed as a high-profile athlete, believed to be NBA player Josh Giddey, and Fonti played a young girl.\n\nAFL boss Andrew Dillon condemned the acts, saying he felt 'disbelief and then disappointment', and labelled the behaviour conduct unbecoming after a complaint was lodged.\n\nUmpires get in trouble too\n\nIt is not just the players who have landed in hot water for post-season celebrations gone too far. In 2024, AFL umpire Leigh Haussen was suspended for one round after dressing up as Osama Bin Laden for the officials' Mad Monday party.\n\nThe event was held in a private room in a Melbourne restaurant the day after the grand final, but the AFL learned of his costume and acted swiftly.\n\n'The theme for the gathering was \"characters from the 2000s\",' the AFL said.\n\n'[Haussen] changed into costume at the venue and wore a mask for only a short period of time before removing it.\n\n'He cooperated fully with the investigation after the AFL was made aware of the function and apologised for wearing the costume which was inappropriate, offensive and in poor taste.'\n\nHaussen admitted his choice of costume was 'inappropriate and offensive'.\n\nGeelong have built a reputation as the undisputed kings of Mad Monday costumes, consistently outshining rival clubs with their creativity.\n\nYear after year, Cats players deliver unforgettable looks, from pensioners with walking frames to spot-on pop culture parodies.\n\nTheir commitment to detail and group themes has made Geelong's Mad Monday outfits a fan favourite and a highlight of the post-season.\n\nThe 'Pies are not only the biggest club in the AFL, they also know how to party. Most of their Mad Monday celebrations have come after finals campaigns, and often premierships.\n\nSo over the years they have compiled a list of impressive costume choices at their end-of-season events.\n\nSome Magpies fancy-dress highlights include players dressing up as characters from TV hits like Peaky Blinders and Game of Thrones, and Isaac Quaynor nailing his look as F1 legend Lewis Hamilton.\n\nBut towering ruckman Mason Cox gets the best and fairest here for dressing up as a T-Rex dinosaur.",

  "summary": "The Australian Football Club (AFL) has been hit by scandals throughout its Mad Monday celebrations, which have led to numerous controversies. These include star players being dumped by their girlfriend, former Footscray ruckman Simon Atkins, and even umpires.

Jimmy Bartel dressed up as Kim Duthie in 2011 and a teammate Mitch Duncan mimicked her in underwear to mimic disgraced player manager Ricky Nixon. In 2013, St Kilda player Clinton Jones was fined $3000 for setting dwarf Blake Johnston's clothes alight during celebrations in South Melbourne. The incident occurred while player John Johnston was speaking to another player with a lighter gas lighter, which was described as an 'childish' act of judgment.",

      "text": "Inside the Richmond pub where footy superstar Dustin Martin was filmed groping a topless woman at a Mad Monday party - as more new details about Tigers scandal emerge\n- The Richmond Tigers were rocked by images released on the eve of their final\n- The images show Martin groping a topless woman and then smiling\n- The venue where the incident occurred has now been revealed\n- The AFL and Richmond are expected to investigate now team's season is over\nNew details have emerged after footage surfaced online of Richmond champion Dustin Martin groping a topless woman's breast from behind after handing her a drink during an end-of-season celebration in 2015.\nThe vision was made public on the eve of the Tigers' elimination final against the Brisbane Lions, which saw Richmond bundled out of the finals in a tense two-point loss at the Gabba on Thursday night.\nMartin is pictured with the topless woman and smirking after the alleged incident\nThe incident occurred during a team function for Mad Monday at The Sporting Globe Bar & Grill in Richmond following the 2015 AFL season, according to the Herald Sun.\nThe players were allegedly in the venue's private function area when the images were taken.\nThe Sporting Globe Bar & Grill is a national chain of pubs/restaurants that have the premise of ensuring punters are 'always close to the action' with a wide array of screens and sporting channels delivering live sport from around the world.\nMartin trudges off the field dejected after the club's elimination final loss to the Brisbane Lions on Thursday night\nThere are 11 franchises in Victoria alone, including regional areas like Geelong and Ballarat. There are also two franchises in Brisbane, Sydney and three in Western Australia.\nThe Sporting Globe Bar & Grill in Richmond where the Mad Monday celebrations took place\nIn Victoria, venues require an Adult Entertainment Permit for the provision of sexually explicit entertainment under the Liquor Act 1992.\nHowever, under section 3 of the Sex Work Act 1994 [Victoria] stripping without toy play is not classified as sex work and could be exempt from requiring this permit.\nWith the Tigers' season now over, both the AFL and Richmond are expected to investigate the incident.\n'The Club has become aware of a video from 2015 that is circulating on-line involving Dustin Martin. The AFL has been informed and we are working cooperatively to understand the circumstances,' Richmond said in a statement.\nTigers coach Damien Hardwick admitted ahead of the club's elimination final loss that the Martin situation had been a distraction.\n'These thing happen from time to time in footy clubs,' he said on Fox Footy.\n'We've dealt with a few issues [before] and we'll deal with more issues again in the future, but the reality is the guys will move on with it.\n'It has been a little bit of a distraction but the fact of the matter is, the guys are here to get a job done and so are we.'\nFooty legend Garry Lyon described the fiasco as the AFL's 'worst nightmare'.\n'That would be, for all sorts of the reasons, the AFL's worst nightmare on the launch of this finals series,' Lyon said on SEN.\nThe Mad Monday scandal kicked off in this area of the hotel, easily indentifiable by the distinctive red beams shown in the video of Martin groping the woman\nLyon compared the Martin footage with the Jordan de Goey scandal earlier this season, in which the Collingwood star attempted to expose a woman's breast while away in Bali.\n'I don't know what to say to this other than you are responsible for your own actions,' Lyon added.\n'That was the thing from Jordan's perspective, unsolicited touching, whether you knew them or not, is not acceptable. That is why it will be an issue and that is why it will be a story that continues to rage throughout the day.'\nMartin's future at Richmond remains under a cloud. While he is contracted to the end of the 2024 season, he has been linked with a return to Sydney and a possible shift to either the Swans or GWS.\nTigers coach Damien Hardwick says he expects Martin to remain at the club in 2023 and 24\nHe has also been linked to a potential move to the Gold Coast, but coach Damien Hardwick said he expects Martin to be a Tiger in 2023 and beyond.\n'He's got two years of his contract to run so as far as I'm concerned all the speculation comes from the people sitting over that side of the table [media]. If you guys keep talking about it, it creates speculation,' he said.\n'The reality is I'm telling you that he's got two more years of his contract. He's not going anywhere.'\nMost watched Sport videos\n- Shilo Sanders ejected from game for throwing punch at player\n- Rampage Jackson's son brutally assaults wrestler in livestream\n- Father of Kansas State QB gets into fist-fight with his other son\n- Mother of trans athlete defends child in front of school board\n- Reporter's awkward clash with Titans coach Des Hasler\n- Footy star taken to hospital after suffering horrific head injury\n- See the miracle golden point finish by the Canberra Raiders\n- 'We missed the simple things' Pep Guardiola reacts to 2-0 nil loss\n- Moment beer can is smashed on Raja Jackson's head prior to assault\n- AFL star Izak Rankine leaves the country\n- Sean Dyche gatecrashes Kerry Katona's date on Celebs Go Dating\n- AFL CEO Andrew Dillon defends Snoop Dog"
