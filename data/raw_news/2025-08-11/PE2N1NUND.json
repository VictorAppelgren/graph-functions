  "description": "The records include emails between top school district officials, text messages and emails.",
  "content": "School officials in Uvalde, Texas, on Monday released text messages, personnel files and student records of the shooter from the 2022 attack at Robb Elementary School, following a yearslong legal battle over public access to the material.\n\nThe records include emails between top school district officials and also, text messages and emails to and from at least two school police officers who were on the scene. The release also contains the personnel file of former Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, who has been described as the on-scene commander of the law enforcement response.\n\nThe release included a handful of text exchanges between Arredondo and others at the district that were sent before the shooting. At 9:04 a.m., the chief told Officer Adrian Gonzales to \"go hang out at the park with the seniors until 11:30.\" At 11:40 a.m., a text to Arredondo from a district secretary noted someone reported hearing shots outside Robb Elementary.\n\n\"They went ahead and locked themselves down,\" the text to Arredondo read. At 1:07 p.m., a text to Arredondo asked if any students were injured or taken to the hospital, and asked if the district can lift the \"secure status\" on the school. The shooter had been killed by law enforcement about 15 minutes earlier.\n\nMedia organizations, including The Associated Press, sued the district and county in 2022 for the release of their records related to the mass shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers.\n\nA Texas appeals court in July upheld a lower court's ruling that the records must be released.\n\nThe records are not the public's first glimpse inside one of the nation's deadliest mass shootings and a slow law enforcement response that has been widely condemned. Last year, city officials in Uvalde released police body cam videos and recordings of 911 calls.\n\nNearly 400 officers waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the gunman in a classroom filled with dead and wounded children and teachers. Multiple federal and state investigations into the response have laid bare cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology, and questioned whether officers prioritized their own lives over those of children and teachers.\n\nTwo school district officers face criminal charges for their actions that day. The former schools police chief Arredondo and former officer Adrian Gonzales both face multiple counts of child endangerment and abandonment. Both men have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial later this year.\n\nThey are the only two responding officers to have been charged.",

      "text": "New videos from Uvalde school shooting show hesitant police response and desperate parents\nUVALDE \u2014 Videos from the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that police originally failed to make public show officers scrambling to treat victims, parents running near the building and dozens of law enforcement agents standing outside Robb Elementary School.\nPolice have said the additional videos were discovered days after a large collection of audio and video recordings were released in August. Taken together, the footage has shown the hesitant police response in the small South Texas city, where a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers inside a fourth-grade classroom in one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history.\nThe hours of new video made public Tuesday include footage similar to the footage already released. In one chaotic scene, officers can be seen doing chest compressions on one victim outside and others yelling for help.\nOne Uvalde officer was put on paid leave in August after the additional videos were discovered. City officials released the material over the summer after a prolonged legal fight with many news organizations, including CBS News.\nThe delayed law enforcement response to the May 24, 2022, shooting has been widely condemned as a massive failure: Nearly 400 officers waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the gunman in a classroom filled with dead and wounded children and teachers in the South Texas city of about 15,000 people, 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of San Antonio.\nWhile terrified students and teachers called 911 from inside classrooms, dozens of officers stood in the hallway trying to figure out what to do. Desperate parents gathered outside the building and pleaded with them to go in.\nPreviously released audio recordings contained 911 calls from terrified instructors and students as gunshots rang out amid pleas for help.\nFederal investigations into law enforcement's response attributed breakdowns in communication and inadequate training for their failure to confront the gunman, with some even questioning whether officers prioritized their own lives over those of children and teachers.\nTwo of the responding officers face multiple criminal charges of abandonment and endangerment. Former Uvalde school Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school officer Adrian Gonzales have pleaded not guilty. Arredondo, who made his first court appearance last month, has stated he thinks he's been scapegoated for the heavily scrutinized police response."

      "text": "Former Uvalde schools police chief loses bid to toss criminal charges related to 2022 shooting; trial set for 2025\nA Texas judge on Thursday refused to throw out criminal charges accusing the former Uvalde schools police chief of putting children at risk during the slow response to the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting, while a lawyer for his co-defendant said they want to move the upcoming trial out of the small town where the massacre occurred.\nAt a court hearing in Uvalde, Judge Sid Harle rejected Pete Arredondo's claim that he was improperly charged and that only the shooter was responsible for putting the victims in danger. Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the shooting on May 24, 2022.\nHarle also set a trial date for Oct. 20, 2025. An attorney for Arredondo's co-defendant, former Uvalde schools police officer Adrian Gonzales, said he will ask for the trial to be moved out of Uvalde because his client cannot get a fair trial there. Uvalde County is mostly rural with fewer than 25,000 residents about 85 miles (140 kilometers) west of San Antonio.\n\"Everybody knows everybody,\" in Uvalde, Gonzales attorney Nico LaHood said.\nBoth former officers attended the hearing.\nNearly 400 law enforcement agents rushed to the school but waited more than 70 minutes to confront and kill the gunman in a fourth-grade classroom. Arredondo and Gonzales are the only two officers facing charges \u2014 a fact that has raised complaints from some victims' families.\nBoth men have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of abandoning or endangering a child, each of which carries a punishment of up to two years in jail. Gonzales has not asked the judge to dismiss his charges.\nA federal investigation of the shooting identified Arredondo as the incident commander in charge, although he has argued that state police should have set up a command post outside the school and taken control. Gonzales was among the first officers to arrive on the scene. He was accused of abandoning his training and not confronting the shooter, even after hearing gunshots as he stood in a hallway.\nArredondo has said he was scapegoated for the halting police response. The indictment alleges he did not follow his active shooter training and made critical decisions that slowed the police response while the gunman was \"hunting\" his victims.\nIt alleges that instead of confronting the gunman immediately, Arredondo caused delays by telling officers to evacuate a hallway to wait for a SWAT team, evacuating students from other areas of the building first, and trying to negotiate with the shooter while victims inside the classroom were wounded and dying.\nArredondo's attorneys say the danger that day was not caused by him but by the shooter. They argued Arredondo was blamed for trying to save the lives of the other children in the building, and have warned that prosecuting him would open many future law enforcement actions to similar charges.\n\"Arredondo did nothing to put those children in the path of a gunman,\" said Arredondo attorney Matthew Hefti.\nUvalde County prosecutors told the judge Arredondo acted recklessly.\n\"The state has alleged he is absolutely aware of the danger of the children,\" said Assistant District Attorney Bill Turner.\nJesse Rizo, the uncle of 9-year-old Jacklyn Cazares who was killed in the shooting, was one of several family members of victims at the hearing.\n\"To me, it's hurtful and painful to hear Arredondo's attorneys try to persuade the judge to get the charges dismissed,\" Rizo said.\nHe called the wait for a trial exhausting and questioned whether moving the trial would help the defense.\n\"The longer it takes, the longer the agony,\" Rizo said. \"I think what's happened in Uvalde \u2026 you'll probably get a better chance at conviction if it's moved. To hold their own accountable is going to be very difficult.\"\nThe massacre at Robb Elementary was one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history, and the law enforcement response has been widely condemned as a massive failure.\nNearly 150 U.S. Border Patrol agents, 91 state police officers, as well and school and city police rushed to the campus. While terrified students and teachers called 911 from inside classrooms, dozens of officers stood in the hallway trying to figure out what to do. More than an hour later, a team of officers breached the classroom and killed the gunman.\nWithin days of the shooting, the focus of the slow response turned on Arredondo, who other responding agencies referred to as the incident commander in charge.\nMultiple federal and state investigations have laid bare cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology, and questioned whether officers prioritized their own lives over those of children and teachers. Several victims or their families have filed multiple state and federal lawsuits.\n___\nAssociated Press reporter Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas, contributed.\n___\nNadia Lathan is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

      "text": "Uvalde County commissioners vote to release Robb Elementary school shooting records, ending legal battle\nLeaders of the county where 19 students and two teachers were killed in the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, voted Monday to release records related to the massacre, ending a yearslong legal battle over disclosure of the information.\nUvalde County commissioners voted 2-1 to release the records and to cease appealing a 2022 lawsuit filed by a group of media organizations, including The Associated Press, which sought to make the information public.\nThe decision by commissioners came a week after the Uvalde district's school board voted to release its records related to the deadly rampage, one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history.\nThe group of media organizations had sued both the county and the school district for the release of the records.\nCounty commissioners and the school district voted to release the records after a Texas appeals court on July 16 upheld a judge's ruling that had ordered the information to be made public.\nNeither the county nor the school district has said when the records will be released.\n\"For me, the appellate court's decision to uphold (the judge's) ruling to hand over the video coverage was just confirmation for me that \u2026 what are we hiding?\" Uvalde County Commissioner Ronald Garza told AP after Monday's meeting. \"I'm very happy that we're gonna release the information.\"\nOne county commissioner, Mariano Pargas Jr., who was the acting police chief on the day of the school shooting, abstained from the vote.\nFamily members of the victims had also pushed to make the records public.\nJesse Rizo, the uncle of 9-year-old victim Jackie Cazares, asked commissioners on Monday to release the records.\nRizo is also a member of the school board. During the board's July 21 meeting, he apologized for the delay in releasing the records.\n\"Will it answer everything? No. Will it give you closure? I don't think anything ever will give you that type of closure. Will it hopefully make you heal or allow you to heal? I pray that it does,\" Rizo said last week.\nRecords from the county that are expected to be released include incident and 911 reports concerning Robb Elementary and other locations; video footage; ballistics and evidence logs; and reports of law enforcement interactions with the shooter and his mother.\nRecords from the school district expected to be released include body-worn and security camera footage from Robb Elementary; student files for the shooter; and records involving Pete Arredondo, the former Uvalde schools police chief who was later indicted over his role in the slow response to the shooting.\nArredondo and former school officer Adrian Gonzales have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges of child abandonment and endangerment. They are set to face trial on Oct. 20.\nSeveral officers involved, including Arredondo, were fired, and separate investigations by the Department of Justice and state lawmakers faulted law enforcement for botching their response to the massacre.\nUvalde city officials released their records in August 2024. The Texas Department of Public Safety is still fighting a separate lawsuit filed by media organizations for the release of that agency's records related to the school shooting."

      "text": "Uvalde leaders approve $2 million for Robb Elementary families in first settlement over attack\nCity leaders in Uvalde approved a $2 million settlement for families of the victims of the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting, marking the first time one of the myriad lawsuits has led to financial compensation.\nAttorneys for the families first announced the terms of the settlement with the city in May 2024, and it was approved by the Uvalde City Council Tuesday night.\nThe settlement with the city will spread the $2 million among the 21 families of the victims killed in one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history, said Javier Cazares, whose daughter Jackie was one of 19 fourth-graders killed by the gunman. Two teachers were also killed.\nThe suit addresses the botched law enforcement response by requiring enhanced training for city police officers. It also expands mental health services available to the families and the greater Uvalde area, sets May 24 as an annual day of remembrance, and establishes a permanent memorial in the city plaza.\n\"This is a small win in a larger battle and a lot of injustice we are still going through,\" Cazares told The Associated Press. \"I couldn't care less about the money.\"\nUvalde is a city of about 15,000 people about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of San Antonio. Uvalde Mayor Hector Luevano said the city's settlement included \"restorative justice initiatives for the families\" but declined to discuss details. He did not say why it took nearly a year to approve the previously announced deal.\n\"The City of Uvalde is committed to honoring the memories of the lives lost, families of the victims, survivors and those affected by this tragedy,\" Luevano said.\nOne of several lawsuits brought by Uvalde victims' families\nThe families have several other lawsuits pending in federal and state courts, including a $500 million lawsuit against Texas state police officials and officers. There's also a suit against social media company Meta Platforms and the company that made video game \"Call of Duty,\" as well as Daniel Defense, the maker of the rifle used in the attack.\nMultiple reports from state and federal officials have laid bare cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology, and questioned whether officers prioritized their own lives over those of children and teachers.\nMore than 370 responding officers from multiple local, state and federal agencies waited more than an hour to confront and kill the gunman.\nTwo former Uvalde schools police officers, Pete Arredondo and Adrian Gonzales, face criminal charges of child endangerment and abandonment and are scheduled for trial later this year, but they remain the only two officers charged. They have pleaded not guilty.\nMixed outcomes for mass shooting lawsuits\nThe track record for lawsuits following mass shootings is mixed. Over the past decade, courts have tossed numerous attempts, many of which brought negligence claims against the government or the places where the attacks took place. But some get results for victims and their families.\nIn 2020, the casino company MGM Resorts International and its insurers agreed to an $800 million settlement over a shooting on the Las Vegas Strip that killed 58 people and injured hundreds more.\nIn April 2023, the Justice Department announced a $144 million settlement with relatives and families of a 2017 Texas church attack, which was carried out by a former U.S. airman with a criminal history.\nAn attorney for the Uvalde families in the recent settlement with the city said they did not want to bankrupt their community \u2014 and that the settlement will be paid through the city's insurance coverage.\n\"Faced with a difficult decision, these families worked with the community they love to make things right without creating deeper economic hardship,\" attorney Josh Koskoff said. \"The road to healing is long and painful, but we are hopeful that this agreement enables families who lost so much and the city they call home to continue that process.\""
