  "description": "Key Insights MAX Automation's estimated fair value is \u20ac7.53 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity MAX Automation is...",
  "content": "\u2022 MAX Automation's estimated fair value is \u20ac7.53 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\u2022 MAX Automation is estimated to be 23% undervalued based on current share price of \u20ac5.80\n\u2022 Analyst price target for MXHN is \u20ac6.10 which is 19% below our fair value estimate How far off is MAX Automation SE (ETR:MXHN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = \u20ac111m\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= \u20ac370m\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.4%)10= \u20ac199m The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is \u20ac310m. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of \u20ac5.8, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at MAX Automation as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.184. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\u2022 Debt is well covered by cash flow.\n\u2022 Interest payments on debt are not well covered.\n\u2022 Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the German market.\n\u2022 Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\u2022 Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the German market. Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For MAX Automation, there are three fundamental aspects you should further research:\n\u2022 Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with MAX Automation , and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\n\u2022 Future Earnings: How does MXHN's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market? Dig deeper into the analyst consensus number for the upcoming years by interacting with our free analyst growth expectation chart.\n\u2022 Other Solid Businesses: Low debt, high returns on equity and good past performance are fundamental to a strong business.

  "summary": "Max Automation SE (ETR:MXHN) is estimated to be undervalued by 23% based on its fair value of \u20ac7.53 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity. This analysis uses the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to estimate the company's future cash flows and discount them back to today's value. The DCF model assumes that companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their growth rate over the next few years, and companies with growing cash flow see this growth decrease. The Terminal Value accounts for all future cash flow beyond the first stage and then discounts the terminal cash flows to today\u2019s value at a cost of equity of 6.4%. The total value, or equity value, is then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Despite this, the company appears undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The analysis uses assumptions such as the discount rate and the future growth rate of the company\u2019 future cashflow, and the potential cyclicality of industry or capital requirements, as well as interest payments on debt. The Beta Beta is a measure of a company's performance compared to the industry's volatility and the annual revenue forecast and annual earnings forecast.",

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling.

  "argos_summary": "MAX Automation SE is trading at \u20ac5.80, roughly 23% below its DCF\u2011derived fair value of \u20ac7.55. Analysts project a 12\u2011month target of \u20ac6.10, still below the intrinsic estimate, while the stock\u2019s PE of 68.3\u00d7 far exceeds the German machinery average of 18.9\u00d7. Earnings are expected to grow 68.6% annually, but revenue growth is modest at 5.3% and the company\u2019s debt is well covered by cash flow yet earnings may be under threat. Overall, the shares appear undervalued relative to fundamentals but carry valuation and earnings\u2011growth risks.",
