  "description": "Matthew Atkinson hinted at a potential return to 'The Bold and the Beautiful,' sharing cryptic Instagram footage from the show's filming location",
  "content": "The Bold and the Beautiful alum Matthew Atkinson teased he could be set to make a return to the long-running soap.\n\nPosting to Instagram on Monday, August 11, the actor, 36, shared footage of himself playing corn hole on the lot where The Bold and the Beautiful is filmed. In the background, the show\u2019s distinctive title could be seen on a sign.\n\nAtkinson did not confirm he was on set to film new scenes during the post. Instead, he cryptically captioned the Instagram post, \u201cSecond time\u2019s a charm.\u201d\n\nFans wondered whether the actor was simply referencing his corn hole game, or whether the post is a not-so-subtle hint that Atkinson\u2019s character, Thomas Forrester, will soon be back in town.\n\nFlocking to the comments section, B&B fans were desperate to know if the fan favorite would be back, urging him to confirm if it was the case.\n\n\u201cAre you employed with the show again? Let me know so i can care about bold again,\u201d wrote one follower, with another begging, \u201cPlease let this mean you\u2019re coming back! We need you!\u201d\n\nEchoing the sentiment, another soap fan commented, \u201cMiss that handsome face.. I hope you come back to B&B as you can see, you have many fans that want you to come back. The story line is getting boring and everyone talks about the same thing. You and Hope kept it alive!! Come back!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u201d\n\nAtkinson joined the CBS series back in 2019, taking over the Thomas Forrester role from his predecessor, Pierson Fod\u00e9.\n\nHis last onscreen appearance on the show took place in July 2024. While Atkinson\u2019s departure from The Bold and the Beautiful was never officially announced, he scrubbed all mention of the soap from his Instagram bio in November, according to Parade. The actor also did not appear in the show\u2019s new opening the following month, leading to speculation he was gone for good.\n\nSpeaking to Soap Opera Digest in June 2024 following an earlier break from the show, Atkinson recalled some of the show\u2019s fans having strong emotions when he first left temporarily.\n\n\u201cI just never expected the response that I\u2019ve gotten and we\u2019ve gotten from the fans, especially [with] Thomas leaving,\u201d Atkinson told the outlet. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for all the fans, but there\u2019s a wealth of people that are either really, really upset that Thomas is gone for a period or really sad. [They] reach out and they\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, when are you back? When are you back? When are you back?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThat just speaks to their care for this character. And that means a lot to me because I would have fun doing this in a vacuum, but it\u2019s really great to have a response that shows that these people care about what you\u2019re doing. And so it\u2019s just been so much love from so many fans that comes out in so many different ways.\u201d",

      "text": "The Bold and the Beautiful is set to debut the soap\u2019s first-ever all-female episode this month.\nHeather Tom, who plays Katie Logan Spencer, will write, act in and direct the first all-female episode in the series\u2019 history, Deadline reported on Friday, March 21. The Women\u2019s History Month-themed episode, which will air on March 27, 2025, will star Tom as well as Rebecca Budig (Taylor), Annika Noelle (Hope), Katherine Kelly Lang (Brooke), Jennifer Gareis (Donna) and Jacqueline MacInnes Wood (Steffy).\n\u201cBrad Bell actually came to me and said, \u2018This is your 35th year. You\u2019ve been writing and directing. You\u2019ve also been acting the whole time, and I think that it would be amazing if you did all three in one show,\u201d Tom told the outlet. \u201cI was like, oh, that\u2019ll be interesting! So logistically it was just, well, let\u2019s figure out how I can be on stage acting in the scenes and then directing those scenes. I thought it was very important and agree that it should air during Women\u2019s History Month because it\u2019s historical.\u201d\nThe episode will primarily focus on the existing mother-daughter relationships on the show.\n\u201cThe mother daughter relationships are so interesting to me and so formative,\u201d Tom explained. \u201cAnd now this is going to make me cry because I lost my mother last year. I wanted to kind of pay homage to her because I certainly wouldn\u2019t be here without her literally and figuratively. So I got a little bit of her in there with Katie and Donna, who are sisters who lost their mom.\u201d\nThe episode also fits into the preexisting plot from this season. \u201cIt does fit within the story of where they are in the series,\u201d Tom added. \u201cWe considered doing something that was more of a standalone, but Brad felt, and I agreed that it needed to just kind of flow with the story and it made sense.\u201d\nBefore she joined the cast of The Bold and the Beautiful, Tom starred on ABC\u2019s One Life to Live. She also spent another 13 years starring as Victoria Newman on The Young and the Restless.\nTo date, Tom is also the only female actor in television history to win an Emmy in all three performer categories: Younger, Supporting and Lead Actress. She has also received 19 nominations throughout her career.\nShe has been doubling as a director since 2016 and has previously directed several episodes of The Bold and the Beautiful as well as of Dynasty, The Young and the Restless and Good Trouble."

      "text": "The official cause of death for Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, has been confirmed.\nSilver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis told Us Weekly on Monday, August 11, that Blackstock\u2019s cause of death was melanoma, a form of skin cancer, and the manner of his death was natural causes. \u201cBrandon Blackstock passed away peacefully at his home in Butte, Montana on August 7th under hospice care surrounded by his family,\u201d Hollis said in a statement.\nBlackstock died on August 7 after privately battling cancer for three years. He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nOne day earlier, Clarkson, 43, alerted fans to Blackstock\u2019s illness when she put her Las Vegas residency on pause, though she didn\u2019t reveal the nature of his condition at the time.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she announced via Instagram on August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock wed in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. During their marriage, Blackstock worked as the singer\u2019s manager. Clarkson ultimately filed for divorce in June 2020 after nearly seven years. The pair finalized the proceedings in March 2022 following a messy legal battle.\nPrior to his relationship with Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The exes shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18.\nIn January 2022, Blackstock became a first-time grandfather when Savannah gave birth to her and now-husband Quentin Lee\u2019s son, Lake. Savannah announced in July that the couple are expecting their second baby.\nOutside of his marriage to Clarkson, Brandon had another Hollywood connection via his father, Narvel Blackstock, who was Clarkson\u2019s manager earlier in her career. Narvel was previously married to Reba McEntire from 1989 to 2015, during which time she was stepmom to Brandon and his two sisters, Chassidy and Shawna. Narvel and McEntire\u2019s son, Shelby, who was born in 1990, was Brandon\u2019s half-brother."

The pair engaged in a subsequent affair, which led to the band breaking up and Joel battling a severe depression that included two suicide attempts. (The affair and its aftermath were discussed in the two-part HBO documentary Billy Joel: And So It Goes, which premiered in July.)\nThe pair later reconnected after Weber\u2019s divorce and married in 1973, going on to spend nearly 10 years together before ending their marriage in 1982. Joel went on to marry Christie Brinkley in 1985, welcoming daughter Alexa Ray Joel before calling it quits in 1994. Joel then married cookbook author Katie Lee in 2004 \u2014 the pair divorced five years later in 2009. In 2015, Joel married Alex Roderick. The pair share two children, Della Rose Joel and Remy Anne Joel.\nWeber, for her part, shares a son, Sean Weber-Small, with her first husband.\nWhile speaking with Us, Weber said that her son and her grandchildren also know and are even somewhat close to Joel.\n\u201cI have my grandchildren that he knows and they know him,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy granddaughter Ella taught Bill what TikTok was and showed him what was happening. And his relationship with Sean is important to both of them.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cSo, we\u2019re not distant but we\u2019re, you know, and he lives in Florida and I live in California. But it\u2019s all good. \u201c\nWeber said that her son Sean and Joel \u201cwere very close,\u201d adding that during their marriage the three \u201clived on top of the mountain.\u201d\n\u201cWe entertained each other,\u201d she explained. \u201cBill and I worked all day long and the whole writing process was never done \u2014 in the years that Bill and I were together \u2014 was never done remotely or in [a] studio. It happened in our living room, and Sean was an integral part.\u201d\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org."

      "text": "Game of Thrones wrapped up its eight-season run in 2019, and there have been a few contenders to be the next GoT, including the prequel series House of the Dragon.\nHowever, Amazon Prime Video\u2018s upcoming miniseries King & Conqueror is giving off some serious Game of Thrones vibes, and there isn\u2019t a dragon in sight.\nThis story is based on the conflict between Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror in 1066 for the throne of England.\nWhile only a few previews have been released so far, Watch With Us is sharing three reasons to watch King & Conqueror when it debuts on Prime Video later this year.\nThe \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Connection\nIf you thought William the Conqueror looked familiar in the trailer, you\u2019re not wrong. Game of Thrones\u2018 Nikolaj Coster-Waldau \u2014 who portrayed Jaime Lannister on the series \u2014 is playing William on this show. William is a vastly different character from the one that Coster-Waldau played for eight seasons, but the actor just seems to fit in well within a medieval setting.\nJames Norton is also leading the cast as William\u2019s rival, Harold Godwinson. The rest of the performers include several veteran British actors, including Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, Emily Beecham, Luther Ford and Eddie Marsan. They may not be household names in America, but that\u2019s a solid cast by any standard.\n\u2018King & Conqueror\u2019 Looks Like It Has High Production Values\nAdmittedly, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of trailers from King & Conqueror yet, so our impressions may change. But even from the early look at the show, it looks like a big budget was spent to bring this show to life in a convincing way.\nEverything from the costumes to the battle scenes suggests that King & Conqueror is going all-out with its production. It may not hit on the same level as last year\u2019s incredible Shogun adaptation, but it seems very promising for now.\nThe Series Will Tackle One of the Most Famous Battles in History\nUnless you\u2019re a student of history, you may not be familiar with the Battle of Hastings. Nearly a thousand years later, that battle is still considered to be one of the bloodiest encounters in English history. William and Harold\u2019s forces met on the battlefield, and the winner went on to rule the country and consolidate their power.\nHistorical details about what happened at the Battle of Hastings are incomplete, and there are also conflicting accounts. So there will probably be some creative liberties taken with it. But we do know how it ends, and it should be entertaining to see this fight play out.\nKing & Conqueror will premiere on Prime Video later this year."

Later that month, MGK shared an Instagram carousel that included a snap of himself posing alongside Sweeney as they flashed peace signs at the camera. (Patrick Schwarzenegger and Hollywood hair stylist Glen Oropeza were also in the snap.)\nAn Instagram Story shared by Sweeney at the time, published by the outlet, also featured a photo of herself posing with Schwarzenegger, 31, and MGK at the Vegas event.\nBoth MGK and Sweeney are currently single after the musician\u2019s split from Megan Fox was confirmed by Us Weekly in December 2024, and Sweeney\u2019s engagement to Jonathan Davino was called off in May. (MGK shares a daughter, Saga, 4 months, with Fox, 39, in addition to daughter Casie, 16, whom he shares with ex Emma Cannon.)\nMGK and Sweeney have been friends for years, with Sweeney starring in MGK\u2019s 2021 directorial debut, Downfalls High. The pair also appeared in the 2019 film Big Time Adolescence alongside MGK\u2019s close friend Pete Davidson.\nMGK\u2019s appearance on WWHL also saw an audience member ask him who his dream musical collaboration would be, living or dead, to which he responded, \u201c I like Frank, man, Frank Sinatra. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d\nHe was also asked by Cohen about how age, which garnered an interesting response from MGK: \u201cIt\u2019s a weird thing, dude, I don\u2019t know if it exists.\u201d\nCohen likened MGK\u2019s \u201cconnection to\u201d his age to that of Mariah Carey, who told Harper\u2019s Bazaar in July that she doesn\u2019t \u201callow\u201d herself to age, which drew MGK to say, \u201cI just don\u2019t know many facts about my life, so I\u2019m starting to just be like, like, my skin, if it just rips open, it heals really quick, there\u2019s just things where I\u2019m starting to be, like, who\u2019s my dad, you know?\u201d\nHinting that he may have otherworldly origins, MGK noted that he once asked his mother if there was any \u201cperiod of time where you went missing,\u201d which provided an unusual answer.\n\u201cShe told me she got abducted at one point so I was just, like,\u201d MGK said with a shrug."

The loyalty, the fans, the opinions \u2026 I started going online and listening to fans argue about certain things. It\u2019s like sports.\u201d\nThe veteran comedian and TV star gushed about his time on set, praising both the stars and crew \u2014 and telling a funny story about his first interaction with Kaye. \u201cEvery 12 minutes, The Bold and the Beautiful does another scene. It\u2019s a well-oiled machine. They\u2019re just so on top of their stuff,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI was in makeup and this guy comes in and goes, \u2018Hey, can I get you anything?\u2019 I go, \u2018I don\u2019t know, do you have Sugar Free Red Bull?\u2019 This guy who I thought was the crew \u2014 he had a very hard handshake \u2014 was Thorsten. The rich, wealthy father [Ridge]!\u201d\nArnold previously appeared on General Hospital in the 90s and noted he\u2019s been a fan of soap operas since skipping school as a kid to tune in. His fandom continued into adulthood with famous ex-wife Roseanne Barr.\n\u201cRoseanne and I loved soap operas. [After I was on General Hospital], we ended up having all these folks on [Roseanne] from the show on,\u201d Arnold told Us of his time as a writer and actor on the classic sitcom. \u201cBecause soap operas are very good actors. They don\u2019t mess around.\u201d\nArnold said that he channeled a story from his days with Barr to play a pilot Deuce. \u201cIt was helpful that back in the day I had a private jet and a pilot. I thought at the time about [when] Roseanne and I got to the airport to fly to New York [and] we got into an argument. She left without me. I had to get another jet to fly behind her,\u201d he began.\nOn B&B, Us can tease that Steffy will be running late to the flight and flustered without her passport. \u201cOne thing that is true is you have a window to land at the airport. And if you mess around and you\u2019re late, you will miss that [window]. I like when there\u2019s some reality to this stuff. It heightened the scene because Steffy forgot her passport,\u201d Arnold continued. \u201cYou expect [the drama] for a character, but it opens the doors for some hilarious stuff. It\u2019s very funny because things are so dramatic that it lends itself to comedy.\u201d\nArnold credited showrunner Brad Bell, whom he\u2019s known for years, for writing the comedic scene. \u201cI appreciated that. But I felt that everyone in the scene was pretty good about a little improvising too,\u201d he told Us. \u201c[Jacqueline] had to do some Lucy stuff with the comedy, ripping stuff out of her bag. \u2026 It\u2019s not easy when you have props and you have to do this and this, but it worked.\u201d\nArnold concluded that he was going to call Bell to campaign to get himself back on the show \u2014 and continue to brag to kids Quinn and Jax, whom he shares with ex Ashley Groussman.\n\u201cI\u2019m a single dad with an 11-year-old and an 8-year-old. I\u2019m just gonna keep repeating, \u2018I was on The Bold and the Beautiful. They\u2019re always like, \u2018Dad, you\u2019re old.\u2019 Dude, I was on The Bold and the Beautiful!\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get on there unless you are bold and beautiful.\u201d\nThe Bold and the Beautiful is broadcast weekdays on CBS at 1:30 ET (and 12:30 PT)."
