      "rationale": "Household balance sheet is a macro indicator that informs about overall wealth distribution but does not provide direct, actionable trading signals. It is a lagging, structural metric rather than a near‑term driver of market movements, so it does not help make immediate financial decisions. According to the policy, topics that do not enable actionable trades receive the lowest importance level."
