Next she\u2019ll be making TikToks with Shakira doing dances and s***.\n\n\u201cWas it all just an act? Or has Dejon already f***** off?\u201d\n\nFans were shocked when Conor, 25, reposted the video - and he was quick to insist it was a mistake.\n\nHe commented: \u201cI reposted by accident!! Meg is my big sis.\u201d\n\nBut his explanation left users divided. One said: \u201cNo you didn\u2019t and it\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote: \u201cConor don\u2019t worry we agree with you.\u201d\n\nBut someone else said: \u201cNah it has happened to me many times, I have reposted by accident.\u201d\n\nMeg and boyfriend Dejon Noel-Williams were dumped from the villa - barely missing out on the final - when ex-Islanders returned to cast their votes.\n\nBut the couple seem determined to prove the doubters wrong.\n\nAfter touching down in the UK, Meg and Dejon, 26, were met by her mum at the airport.\n\nHe later shared a snap of the moment, writing: \u201cI said one of the first things I wanted to do when I got back home was speak to Meg's mum and there she was, waiting to greet us at the airport. Some woman for one woman.\u201d",
