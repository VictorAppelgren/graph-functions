At the Meeting, the omnibus equity incentive plan and all unallocated options, rights, and other entitlements thereunder were approved by an ordinary resolution of disinterested shareholders. At the Meeting, the stock options (\"Options\") previously granted to certain directors and officers of the Company were approved by an ordinary resolution of disinterested shareholders. Transition of Chief Operating Officer to an Advisory Role primarily supporting Regulatory Initiatives The Company also announced the transition of its Chief Operating Officer (\"COO\"), Thomas Scarnecchia, to an advisory role primarily supporting the Company's regulatory initiatives effective September 1, 2025. \"I would like to acknowledge and thank Thomas for his dedication, efforts and leadership provided to Light AI over the past fours years which have been instrumental in enabling the Company to be well positioned to capitalize on our sizeable global market opportunity,\" stated Peter Whitehead, Chief Executive Officer of the Company. \"I am delighted that Thomas will continue to work with the Company to primarily support its regulatory initiatives going forward.\"\n\nLight AI Inc. is a technology company focused on developing artificial intelligence health screening and diagnostic solutions. Light AI is developing a technology platform which represents the next generation of patient management: it applies AI algorithms to smartphone images\u2014starting with images of Strep A and anticipated expansion with COVID19 along with other medical conditions \u2014to identify the disease in seconds. Its patented, app-based solution requires no swabs, lab tests or proprietary hardware of any kind\u2014its hardware platform is the 4.5 billion smartphones that exist in the world today. Light AI is at the forefront of developing innovative screening and diagnostic solutions aimed at improving healthcare delivery worldwide. Their cutting-edge AI powered technology offers rapid, accurate, and cost-effective screening and diagnostic tools designed to address critical healthcare challenges. In pre-FDA validation studies, Light AI's algorithm demonstrated remarkable accuracy in differentiating between viral and bacterial pharyngitis, specifically targeting Group A Streptococcus (GAS). The algorithm achieved a 96.57% accuracy rate and attained a Negative Predictive Value of 100%, indicating its high reliability in confirming the absence of Streptococcus A infection. Viral and GAS pharyngitis affects over 600 million people annually worldwide. If left untreated, GAS pharyngitis can lead to serious complications such as Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD), which imposes a global economic burden exceeding $1 trillion annually. Light AI's technology offers a significant advancement in the accurate and timely identification of GAS pharyngitis, potentially reducing the incidence of RHD and its associated costs. Light AI's approach to applying AI to smartphone images can be expanded to other throat conditions, as well as other areas of analysis, such as the human eye and skin. Light AI's vision is to combine the smartphone with AI in-the-Cloud to create a Digital Clinical Lab that provides quick and accessible diagnosis for countless conditions that today require expensive and time-consuming imaging or lab processes.

Here's how it's changing healthcare. Scientific breakthroughs enabled by AI received recognition with two Nobel Prizes in 2024. John Hopfield, and Geoffrey Hinton whose widely regarded as the 'Godfather of AI,' were both honoured with the Nobel Prize in Physics for their fundamental discoveries and inventions in ML, which underpin today's boom in AI. In healthcare, AI has made waves in drug discovery. But it's also quietly reshaping another critical area: diagnostics. This is where Light AI is making its mark. Diagnostics are complex, context-rich, and vital to patient care \u2014 yet this area receives just 2% of global healthcare funding. This underinvestment presents an opportunity for real change and scalable impact. AI is uniquely positioned to master this domain \u2014 and who knows? The next healthcare breakthrough that wins a Nobel Prize might come from this very space.\n-\n\ud83c\udfe5 The last time you visited an emergency room, how long did you wait? Now flip that question around: How long did you wait before deciding to go...because you knew there'd be a wait? It can be frustrating to visit and leave with never having needed to be there in the first place. And it can also be devastating to end up finding out you should've been there sooner. George Reznik and Sheldon Chang shared at CEM in Bermuda this weekend how the above scenario can be mitigated with Light AI's app, being released in the Fall. The app is primed to be able to detect a wide range of diseases in the long-term.

This is a major milestone for both Tantalus and the utility industry overall. Tantalus TEGs will seamlessly integrate with EPB\u2019s existing fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network and support EPB\u2019s metering infrastructure with advanced power quality insights while simultaneously supporting broadband services. It\u2019s one of the largest-scale examples of data-centric grid modernization yet, as this deployment will provide EPB with even more visibility, command and control over their distribution grid through the use of advanced analytics, powered by granular, real-time data from our TEGs. This agreement is the result of a long-time collaboration between Tantalus and EPB, who has served on Tantalus\u2019 TRUSense Gateway Advisory Committee and provided invaluable input into the development of this solution. Our work together provides a blueprint for other utilities to follow as they seek to accelerate their grid modernization efforts.

This is one of the first known instances of a JAA rolling out AI-driven analytics to multiple utilities at the same time, and we\u2019re excited to be pioneering these kinds of solutions in partnership with IMPA. This is one of the most cost-effective and innovative ways to accelerate grid modernization\u2014by harnessing the power of data.
