  "title": "American Eagle says Sydney Sweeney campaign is its 'best' to date as it beats earnings expectations",
  "description": "American Eagle said its Sydney Sweeney campaign is its best ever, leading to positive gains in new customers, sales and foot traffic.",
  "content": "An American Eagle advertisement featuring actress Sydney Sweeney on billboards in New York, US, on Monday, Aug. 4, 2025.\n\nAmerican Eagle said Wednesday its partnership with Sydney Sweeney has been its \"best\" advertising campaign to date as it announced fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations.\n\nThe company's splashy, yet controversial, campaign with the \"Euphoria\" star led to some criticism and blowback but the launch, coupled with a recent partnership with Taylor Swift's new fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce, has led to new customer acquisition and positive traffic across channels.\n\nAmerican Eagle stock soared more than 8% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\n\"The fall season is off to a positive start. Fueled by stronger product offerings and the success of recent marketing campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce, we have seen an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales,\" CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. \"We look forward to building on our progress and the continued strength of our iconic brands to drive higher profitability, long-term growth and shareholder value.\"\n\nThe company also re-issued its full-year guidance after withdrawing it earlier this year. It now expects comparable sales to be approximately flat, better than the 0.2% decline analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount.\n\nIt still expects gross margin to be down for the duration of the year, but it made key changes to its outlook for operating income, which is bearing the brunt of the tariff impact. The company is now expecting its full-year operating income to be between $255 million and $265 million, down from a previous range of between $360 million and $375 million.\n\nHere's how American Eagle performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $77.6 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with $77.3 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nSales fell to $1.28 billion, down slightly from $1.29 billion a year earlier.\n\nFor the current quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up in the low single digit range, better than the 0.9% uptick analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. It's expecting the same trend during the fourth quarter.\n\nSo far this year, American Eagle's performance has been marred by merchandising missteps, tariffs and an uncertain consumer that's being more selective when spending money on products like clothes and shoes.\n\nTo turn things around, American Eagle launched its campaign with Sweeney ahead of the crucial back-to-school shopping season, but in some ways, that also backfired when it incited outrage from some customers.\n\nThe slogan American Eagle chose for the campaign \u2014 \"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans\" \u2014 led some far-left critics to say the remark was a double entendre and a nod to eugenics. Meanwhile, those on the right celebrated the campaign, leading President Donald Trump to weigh in and call it the \"hottest\" ad around.\n\nMore widely, the campaign also faced pushback from some who said the ads were overly sexualized and out of touch, leading them to wonder what type of consumer the company was targeting.\n\nThe campaign launched on July 23 at the tail end of American Eagle's fiscal second quarter, but the company said it's so far been a success, despite the pushback it received. The Sweeney campaign, along with the partnership it launched with Kelce, has led to \"meaningful improvement in the business\" with comps so far this quarter up in the mid-single digits. American Eagle said it's gained 700,000 new customers and that traffic across channels has been \"consistently positive\" throughout August, despite some news reports indicating the contrary.\n\nThe Sweeney campaign has led to denim sellouts, double-digit traffic growth and increased awareness and engagement, the company said. The Sydney Jacket sold out in one day and The Sydney Jean, a custom style that donated 100% of proceeds to the Crisis Text Line, which provides mental health support, sold out in one day.\n\nMeanwhile, American Eagle's launch with Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, the day after he announced his engagement to the pop star, drove three times more sales in one day than past collaborations did in a week, the company said. Many of the items, specifically ones worn by Kelce and his fellow athletes, sold out.\n\nAmerican Eagle's partnerships with Sweeney and Kelce highlight the work the retailer is doing to stay relevant with consumers and cut through the noise as spending remains soft.\n\nIt's also facing stiff competition from peers like Abercrombie & Fitch , Gap and Levi's . Recently, Gap launched its \"Better in Denim\" campaign featuring Katseye and Kelis's 2003 hit \"Milkshake.\" Meanwhile, Levi's has had an ongoing campaign featuring Beyonc\u00e9 while Abercrombie has taken a sports focus and partnered with the NFL.\n\nCompounding American Eagle's challenges is the uncertain tariff environment. American Eagle has been working to reduce its reliance on China to under 10% this year but it also has a heavy manufacturing presence in Vietnam and India, which have been the subject of reciprocal tariffs.",

      "text": "Shares of American Eagle rose Wednesday morning after the apparel company announced a collaboration with football star Travis Kelce, just a day after he and singer Taylor Swift said they were engaged.\nThe stock was up roughly 5% in early trading.\nKelce's sportswear brand, Tru Kolors, is launching a limited-edition collaboration with American Eagle, pairing the jeans brand with Kelce's picks, including vintage-inspired T-shirts and \"reimagined\" varsity jackets. The collaboration was more than a year in the making, Kelce said, but the announcement came just a day after his proposal caused a global internet stir among fans.\n\"It was an awesome opportunity to team up with an established brand where both sides were excited to truly collaborate on every decision in the design and creative process that brought the 'AE x TK' collection to life,\" Kelce, the creative director of the collection, said in a statement.\nThe new pieces are launching in two drops on Wednesday and on Sept. 24.\nAmerican Eagle wasn't the only stock to get a bump from the NFL star's engagement announcement this week. Shares of Signet Jewelers popped briefly following the proposal as fans focused on Swift's \"cushion cut\" engagement ring.\nOther companies wasted no time in using the proposal to promote their products, such as Domino's, Grubhub and Solidcore, among others.\nKelce's American Eagle collaboration comes after the jeans brand announced a collaboration with actress Sydney Sweeney in July. That team-up captivated the internet over what some critics deemed a tone-deaf campaign for its wordplay of good \"jeans\" and \"genes.\"\nShares of the company soared in a meme-stock fashion after the Sweeney promos were unveiled, aided by President Donald Trump calling the campaign the \"hottest ad out there.\"\nThe stock is up about 20% since mid-July.\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify that Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift announced their engagement on Tuesday."

      "text": "President Donald Trump's aggressive trade agenda hit a significant snag this week when a federal appeals court ruled that most of his \"reciprocal tariffs\" are illegal.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held Friday that Trump overstepped his presidential authority when he imposed levies on virtually every country in the world as part of his April 2 \"liberation day\" announcement.\nBefore court action, Trump's tariffs were set to affect roughly 69% of U.S. goods imports, according to the Tax Foundation. If struck down, the duties would impact just roughly 16%.\nThe ruling injects a heavy dose of uncertainty into a central tenet of Trump's economic agenda, which has rattled the global economy since April.\nFor now, the appeals court ruling states the duties on goods from most countries \u2014 as high as 50% for a few countries \u2014 will stay in effect until Oct. 14, to allow the Trump administration time to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nWhich of Trump's tariffs are impacted?\nThe appeals court decision affects the \"reciprocal tariffs\" Trump announced on April 2, as well as levies he had previously imposed on Mexico, Canada and China.\nTrump cited the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify his sweeping tariffs. He declared the United States' trade deficit with other nations a national emergency, and invoked IEEPA to impose the steep levies.\nThe appeals court ruled, however, that IEEPA does not give him authority to implement the tariffs, stating that power resides solely with Congress.\n\"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,\" the court said in its 7-4 ruling.\nThe ruling puts Trump's levies, which took effect earlier this month after multiple delays, on shaky ground. Trump imposed the tariffs on more than 60 countries, including a 50% rate on India and Brazil. He also imposed a 10% baseline tariff on most other countries that were not hit with a specified reciprocal tariff rate.\nThe court also deemed Trump's tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico \u2014 which the administration claimed were necessary because the countries were not doing enough to curb the alleged trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S. \u2014 were illegal.\nTrump has said that he will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote on social media.\nIf the high court ultimately determines that the tariffs are illegal, there are still other ways for Trump to implement levies, but the scope would likely be much more restricted.\nFor instance, Trump could invoke the 1974 Trade Act, but that law caps tariffs at 15% and only for 150 days, unless Congress extends them.\nWhich of Trump's levies are spared?\nParts of Trump's agenda remain safe from the court decision.\nMost notably, his sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum remain unaffected by the appeals court's ruling.\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration expanded its 50% steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 additional product categories, according to the Department of Commerce.\nTrump has relied on these sector-specific tariffs \u2014 often referred to as Section 232 tariffs \u2014 to bypass court proceedings.\n\"Section 232 tariffs are central to President Trump's tariff strategy,\" Mike Lowell, a partner at law firm Reed Smith, previously told CNBC.\n\"They aren't the target of the pending litigation, and they're more likely to survive a legal challenge and continue into the next presidential administration, which is what we saw with the aluminum and steel tariffs originally imposed under the first Trump administration,\" Lowell said.\nThe Trump administration is reportedly planning to expand its sector-specific tariffs, including those on steel and aluminum, as a way of skirting the looming legal battles, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nThe tariffs that Trump imposed on China during his first term, which former President Joe Biden maintained, are also likely to remain in place despite the appeals court ruling.\nFinally, the \"de minimis\" exemption was officially eliminated on Friday, so imports valued at $800 or less are now subject to tariffs and duties, another blow to small and medium-sized U.S. businesses, and a part of Trump's trade agenda that appears safe from court action."

      "text": "American Eagle on Tuesday said it is writing off $75 million in spring and summer merchandise and withdrawing its full-year guidance as it contends with slow sales, steep discounting and an uncertain economy.\nThe apparel retailer said it expects revenue in the first quarter, which ended in early May, to be around $1.1 billion, a decline of about 5% compared to the prior-year period. American Eagle anticipates comparable sales will drop 3%, led by an expected 4% decline at intimates brand Aerie. American Eagle previously expected first-quarter sales to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage and anticipated full-year sales would drop by a low single-digit percentage.\nShares plunged more than 17% in extended trading.\nWhen it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results in March, American Eagle warned that the first quarter was off to a \"slower than expected\" start, due to weak demand and cold weather. Conditions evidently worsened as the quarter progressed, and the retailer turned to steep discounts to move inventory.\nAs a result, American Eagle is expecting to see an operating loss of around $85 million and an adjusted operating loss, which cuts out one-time charges related to its restructuring, of about $68 million for the quarter. That loss reflects \"higher than planned\" discounting and a $75 million inventory charge related to a write-down of spring and summer merchandise, the company said.\n\"We are clearly disappointed with our execution in the first quarter. Merchandising strategies did not drive the results we anticipated, leading to higher promotions and excess inventory. As a result, we have taken an inventory write down on spring and summer goods,\" said CEO Jay Schottenstein.\n\"We have entered the second quarter in a better position, with inventory more aligned to sales trends,\" he said. \"Additionally, we are actively evaluating our forward plans. Our teams continue to work with urgency to strengthen product performance, while improving our buying principles.\"\nThe company added it is withdrawing its fiscal 2025 guidance \"due to macro uncertainty and as management reviews forward plans in the context of first quarter results.\" It is unclear if recent tariff policy changes had an effect on American Eagle.\nSome companies bought inventory earlier than usual to plan for higher duties, but American Eagle repeatedly said in March that it was in a solid inventory position and was able to go after trends as customer preferences shifted.\nAt the start of the first quarter, the company said it had some inventory outages and needed to supplement stock in a few key categories, particularly at Aerie, one of its primary growth drivers."

      "text": "Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday how the denim retailer will benefit from its partnership with Beyonc\u00e9, saying the ads could help boost sales of women's clothing.\n\"Levi's has been talking about women's for quite some time. We see this as growing to at least half of our business, doubling over time, $2 billion even just this year,\" Gass said. \"Now you bring Beyonc\u00e9 into the ecosystem, you know, we think we're just set up for the long term really, really well.\"\nLevi's officially launched the first part of a new ad campaign with the iconic pop star on Monday. The collaboration comes after Beyonc\u00e9 released her newest album, \"Cowboy Carter,\" in the spring that featured a track called \"LEVII'S JEANS.\" Levi's has worked with the singer on other occasions over years, including during her time in Destiny's Child in the early 2000s.\nWhile Gass pinpointed women's a \"bright spot\" in the business, she also explained some of the headwinds the company has faced over the past quarter. Levi's posted earnings after close on Wednesday, missing Wall Street's expectations for revenue and trimming its revenue guidance. The stock dipped more than 9% in extended trading.\nShe described problems with the company's business in China, Mexico and with its Dockers brand. She said the Levi's faced some of its \"own executional issues\" in the two countries, but that the retailer is addressing them. Difficulties in China were exacerbated by the macro environment in the economy, she added. She claimed wholesale, a large part of Levi's business in Mexico, was down because one of the company's \"key customers\" had a cybersecurity breach that impacted shipping. Gass also said that the Dockers brand has \"underperformed for some time,\" and Levi's intends to sell the business.\n\"We're expecting sequential improvement into the fourth quarter, being up mid-single digits and carrying that through into '25,\" she said.\nSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

      "text": "Gap stock fell in extended trading on Thursday after the company warned tariffs will impact its profits moving forward.\nWhen Gap last reported results in May, it said it expected tariffs to cost between $100 million and $150 million on a net basis, but on Thursday, it said those costs are now going to be between $150 million and $175 million.\nIts full-year operating margin is expected to be between 6.7% and 7%, down from 7.4% in the previous fiscal year, reflecting a tariff impact between 1 percentage point and 1.10 percentage points.\nIn its current quarter, its expecting its gross margin to be down between 1.5 and 1.7 percentage points, driven by tariff costs.\nBeyond tariffs, the specialty apparel company behind Old Navy, Athleta, Banana Republic and its namesake banner delivered mixed results in its fiscal second quarter. Here's how Gap performed in the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: 57 cents vs. 55 cents expected\n- Revenue: $3.73 billion vs. $3.74 billion expected\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $216 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with $206 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier.\nSales rose to $3.73 billion, up slightly from $3.72 billion a year earlier. Sales came in lower than expected and so did comparable sales. During the quarter, comparable sales rose 1%, weaker than the 1.9% rise that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.\nWhile Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy all saw comparable sales rise during the quarter, Athleta dragged down the company's overall performance with comps down 9%.\n\"Clearly, Athleta is a powerful brand in the active space, being the number five brand in the space, but we're disappointed in the quarter. We have moved away, if you will, from really distinctive performance roots,\" CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. \"We've paid a lot of attention, trying to court a new customer, and ultimately didn't have enough offerings for our core customer. As we balance that out, we've been very transparent to say it's a year of reset for us.\"\nLast month, Gap announced that Maggie Gauger, a longtime veteran of Nike, had been tapped as Athleta's next CEO \u2014 the third top executive hired to helm the brand in the last two years.\nThe company reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 net sales growth outlook and is continuing to expect revenue to grow between 1% and 2%, in line with estimates of 1.6%, according to LSEG. For the current quarter, Gap is expecting sales to grow between 1.5% and 2.5%, better than the 2% that analysts had estimated, according to LSEG.\nTo offset the impact of tariffs, Gap is doing what other companies are doing: working with its suppliers, adjusting its sourcing, diversifying its supply chain and taking targeted price increases where appropriate.\nNotably, the company said it doesn't expect the annualization of tariffs to cause any further declines in operating income in 2026.\n\"As it relates to pricing, we're making targeted adjustments with pricing, as we always do. There isn't anything that we've done that is substantially different,\" Dickson said. \"We focus on making sure that we're presenting to our consumer the right value proposition, and ultimately want to make even more sure that we're sustaining the momentum and market share gains that our playbook has been performing.\"\nJust over two years into Dickson's tenure as Gap's CEO, the company is in a far different position. It's seen six straight quarters of comparable sales growth, it's sitting on a $2.2 billion cash pile and its brands are back at the center of culture and conversation.\nRecently, Gap launched its \"Better in Denim\" campaign featuring Katseye and Kelis's 2003 hit \"Milkshake.\" Dickson said the campaign has been a standout success, delivering 20 million views in the first three days, 400 million total views and 8 billion impressions. It's also the No. 1 search on TikTok, Dickson said.\n\"We could all acknowledge that Gap moved from what was a clothing retailer just a couple years ago, that was overly promotional and didn't have necessarily a strong voice from a merchandising perspective to consumers, and now today, it is a pop culture brand that's telling great stories, driving great merchandising initiatives and arguably shaping culture with some of the programs and products and marketing campaigns,\" Dickson said. \"This is proving that Gap is a powerful pop culture brand, and this is also what our playbook looks like when you get it right.\"\nThe campaign highlights the efforts Gap is taking to stay competitive in the crucial denim category, especially with Levi's recent partnership with Beyonc\u00e9 and American Eagle's campaign with Sydney Sweeney. At a time when consumers are pulling back on nice-to-have products like new clothes and accessories, retailers have had to do more to cut through the noise and ensure they're resonating with consumers.\nStill, as the company continues to make strides in its turnaround plan, Wall Street has come to expect a lot, and Gap has had to work harder to beat expectations.\nDuring the quarter, its gross margin came in at 41.2%, behind expectations of 41.9%, according to StreetAccount.\nHere's a closer look at how each brand performed:\nOld Navy: Gap's largest and most important brand saw sales of of $2.2 billion, up 1% compared with last year. Comparable sales were up 2%, compared with expectations of up 2.2%, according to StreetAccount.\nGap: The namesake banner saw net sales of $772 million, up 1% compared with last year. Comparable sales were up 4%, compared with expectations of 4.1%, according to StreetAccount. Its the seventh consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth.\nBanana Republic: The safari-chic, business essentials brand saw net sales of $475 million, down 1% compared with last year. Comparable sales were up 4%, far ahead of expectations of 0.2%, according to StreetAccount.\nAthleta: The athleisure brand saw sales of $300 million, down 11% compared to last year. Comparable sales were down 9%. The brand's new CEO is looking to reverse that slump and reconnect with Athleta's core consumer."

      "text": "Shares of American Eagle surged more than 23% on Monday after President Donald Trump complimented the retailer's marketing campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney.\n\"Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the 'HOTTEST' ad out there. It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are 'flying off the shelves.' Go get 'em Sydney!\" Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social not long after markets opened.\nShortly after Trump's post, shares of American Eagle jumped. Monday's gains come a little over a week after American Eagle first announced that the \"Euphoria\" star would headline its fall marketing campaign with the slogan: \"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.\"\nInitially, the stock rose in an apparent bout of meme stock mania, but over the past week, shares of the company have been down as American Eagle has faced criticism about the campaign. That slump rebounded on Monday when Trump weighed in on the discourse.\nThe slogan American Eagle chose for the campaign \u2014 \"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans\" \u2014 has led some far-left critics to say the remark was a double entendre. Instead of being about pants, it was really about the actress' genetics and the fact that she has blonde hair and blue eyes, critics said. The ad also faced pushback more widely for being overly sexualized and out of touch, reminiscent of previous marketing norms that many say no longer resonate with the public.\nAmerican Eagle has stayed largely quiet on the matter \u2014 releasing a brief statement on its Instagram account on Friday that said the slogan \"is and always was about the jeans.\"\n\"We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way,\" the company said. \"Great jeans look good on everyone.\"\nThe saga highlights the tightrope that marketers are walking when deciding what types of ads to run and the audiences they should be targeting when consumer attention is harder than ever to win and maintain. Bud Lite's ill-fated Dylan Mulvaney collaboration and the subsequent impact on its sales and its parent company's stock price, highlighted how things can go wrong when companies release marketing that some may consider \"woke.\" On the other hand, American Eagle's campaign is now showing the other side of that coin \u2013 what can happen when a company releases marketing that isn't \"woke\" and perhaps more accepted on the cultural right.\nIn the lead-up to American Eagle's campaign with Sweeney, the company has been struggling to grow sales, and the marketing blitz is one of the many things it's doing to reverse that negative slump.\nIt's too early to say if the campaign has positively or negatively impacted sales, but it has made American Eagle more top of mind with shoppers. Google trend data shows search interest for American Eagle is at its highest level in more than 20 years. Whether or not that search interest translates to more shoppers buying jeans from American Eagle will be more clear when the retailer reports earnings, which is expected in the next few weeks.\nAs of Friday's close, shares of American Eagle were down more than 27% so far this year as the company grapples with larger macroeconomic concerns related to tariffs, consumer spending and its own merchandising missteps.\nEarlier this year, the company said it would take a $75 million write-down in spring and summer merchandise after it pulled its full-year guidance due to slow sales, steep discounting and a volatile macroeconomic environment.\nFor its current quarter, American Eagle said in May that it expects revenue to fall 5%, comparable sales to be down 3% and gross margin to be lower compared with the prior year. Its operating income for the second quarter is expected to be between $40 million and $45 million."

      "text": "American Eagle Outfitters reported quarterly earnings on Thursday that missed expectations, reflecting a $75 million write-down in spring and summer merchandise, following the retailer pulling its full-year guidance earlier this month due to macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\"The first quarter was a challenging period for our business,\" CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a release. \"While we are disappointed with the results, we are taking actions to better position the company and drive stronger performance in the upcoming quarters. Our brands remain resilient. The team is executing with urgency as we look to strengthen both the topline and profit flow-through.\"\nThe Pittsburgh retailer's results do not come as a surprise for investors, considering it preannounced some of its results two weeks ago. At that time, it also announced it would withdraw its full-year guidance as it manages slow sales, steep discounting and a volatile macroeconomic environment.\nShares fell about 8% in extended trading.\nHere's how the apparel company did in its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n- Loss per share: 29 cents adjusted vs. loss of 22 cents expected\n- Revenue: $1.09 billion vs. $1.09 billion expected\nPrior to the preannouncement, analysts had been expecting earnings per share to be an 11-cent profit.\nThe company, which makes fashion clothing targeted at teens and young adults, reported an operating loss for the three-month period that ended May 3 of $85.18 million compared with a net income of $77.84 million a year earlier.\nExcluding one-time charges related to restructuring and a supply chain optimization project, AEO posted an adjusted operating loss of $68.06 million. The loss also reflects \"higher than planned\" promotions and a write-off of $75 million in spring and summer merchandise.\nRevenue dropped to $1.09 billion, in line with expectations but down slightly from $1.14 billion a year earlier.\nComparable sales were down 3% during the quarter, led by a 4% decline at the company's intimates and activewear line, Aerie. The namesake brand saw comparable sales down 2%.\nAEO issued downbeat guidance for the second quarter, expecting revenue to be down 5% compared to an estimate of 4%, comparable sales down 3% and gross margin down year-over-year. Its operating income for the second quarter is expected to be between $40 million and $45 million.\nSchottenstein said during a conference call with investors on Thursday that he was \"disappointed\" by the first-quarter results. He said earlier this month that the $75 million write-off is due to miscalculated merchandising strategies resulting in excess inventory and higher promotions.\nJennifer Foyle, president and executive creative director for AE & Aerie, said on Thursday's call that the brand had misses on the merchandising product in a handful of key categories, which was compounded by a cool spring and a slow start to the quarter in February. She said shorts were a tough product across all AEO brands.\n\"Some of our big fashion ideas for the season simply did not resonate with our customer,\" Foyle said, discussing Aerie's performance.\nExecutives on the call repeatedly highlighted the company's goal to be on track for the important back-to-school season later this year.\nAmerican Eagle is not the only retailer to withdraw or modify financial guidance this year based on President Donald Trump's ever-changing trade policy.\nE.l.f. Beauty, Canada Goose, Ross and Mattel all pulled their full-year guidance recently due to trade uncertainty. Other brands, like Abercrombie & Fitch and Macy's have cut their profit outlooks.\nOn Thursday's call, CFO Michael Mathias said the company is on track to reduce its sourcing exposure to China to under 10% this year, with the fall and holiday season down to low single digits. He said the mitigated tariff impact to the full year is around $40 million, including a \"couple million dollars\" in the second quarter that is already embedded in the guidance, and the rest is spread out later in the year.\nDuring last quarter's call with investors, CFO Michael Mathias said the company sources just under 20% of its products from China. He said then that tariffs could result in a $5 million to $10 million hit and could affect gross margin, although at the time he said the company was not planning on passing costs onto the consumer. On Thursday, the executives did not specify whether prices would be raised.\nAccording to AEO's website, the company works with the greatest number of factories in China (101), Vietnam (67) and India (39). It works with just 12 factories in the United States.\nBefore withdrawing its guidance, AEO warned back in March that shoppers are pulling back on spending.\nThe company added Thursday that it is on track to complete its $200 million accelerated share repurchase program in the second quarter.\nAs of Thursday's close, AEO stock has fallen roughly 33% year-to-date."
