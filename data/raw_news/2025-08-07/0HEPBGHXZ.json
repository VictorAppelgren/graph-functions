  "content": "Disneyland could have had a Robin Hood Castle, Pleasure Island, archery range, ghost town and little church if initial plans dreamed up in the early 1950s by Walt Disney and his artists for the fledgling theme park had come to fruition.\n\nEarly conceptual maps of Disneyland drawn by Disney Legends Harper Goff in 1951 and Marvin Davis in 1953 reveal a host of early ideas that were never realized at the Anaheim theme park.\n\nA dozen of the early maps created before Disneyland\u2019s grand opening in 1955 on display in the Main Street Opera House lobby show a visual evolution of the park as it progressed from concept to reality.\n\nThe Opera House lobby serves as a pre-show for the new \u201cWalt Disney \u2014 A Magical Life\u201d animatronic show that debuted on July 17 \u2014 the 70th anniversary of Disneyland\u2019s grand opening.\n\nThe earliest Disneyland maps from 1951 envisioned a 16-acre theme park adjacent to the Disney movie studio in Burbank.\n\nA pair of May 1953 maps expanded the footprint of the park as Walt began scouting for larger locations for Disneyland. Those 1953 maps maintained the western entrance intended for the smaller Burbank theme park.\n\nThe first maps of the Anaheim location in August 1953 still incorporated a western entrance. The orientation shifted to the south entrance that we know today during a series of September 1953 maps. Plans for a Sound Stage and TV Theater Building left over from the earlier Burbank studio plans still remained in the September 1953 renderings.\n\nA castle always played a role in the early plans for Disneyland \u2014 but it didn\u2019t belong to Sleeping Beauty.\n\nA 1951 map showed pleasure boats encircling a castle on an island. Other plans called for a Robin Hood Castle along with a Sherwood Forest. Another version envisioned a Cinderella Palace along with a dining room dedicated to the princess.\n\nDisneyland could have included a Police Department, Court House and Post Office that showed up on early maps alongside the City Hall and Fire Station that made it onto Main Street U.S.A.\n\nA hotel imagined inside the park in 1951 would have served more as a storefront facade for a shopping arcade. A larger hotel planned next to the park entrance in 1953 could have accommodated overnight guests.\n\nThe earliest renderings of Disneyland in 1951 included a Little Church near a Riverboat Landing. The church moved to the end of a Residential Street on a May 1953 map and to the park\u2019s central hub where the Plaza Inn restaurant stands today on a September 1953 map.\n\nWalt sent his artists to Knott\u2019s Berry Farm to draw inspiration for Disneyland \u2014 and several signature landmarks in the Buena Park tourist attraction showed up in early plans for the first Disney theme park.\n\nThe 1951 Disneyland maps included a Ghost Town, Blacksmith and Gold Mine while the 1953 maps featured a School House and Wells Fargo stagecoach stop.\n\nMay 1953 maps included a warren of Foreign Streets and a series of Foreign Shops before the Main Street U.S.A. concept was settled on. An August 1953 map featured a version of Fantasyland with a London Street leading to a Peter Pan Pirate Ship next to Pinocchio Square.\n\nFantasyland evolved as each new rendering was created with a Pleasure Island section, Fantasia Illusion walk-through attraction, Captain Nemo submarine and Toy Factory all making brief appearances.\n\nEarly plans for a Lilliputian Museum and Lilliputian Land with a miniature train and canal boat rides eventually got absorbed into Fantasyland.\n\nAn archery range planned next to a Sherwood Forest party dell on a Sept. 7, 1953 map was later placed next to a Mother Goose walk-through attraction in a Sept. 12, 1953 rendering.\n\nDisney artists struggled to fill all the empty spaces on the every-growing maps as the scope of Disneyland grew.\n\nEarly plans called for a Zoo and Marine Land as well as a Botanical Conservatory and Tropical Garden that led to a True Life Adventure Island.\n\nLarge swaths of land were filled with plans for a Recreation Land with a baseball diamond and a Holiday Park with a lake for special events and convention outings.\n\nA few attractions that eventually made it into Disneyland showed up on the early maps. A Haunted House appeared on a 1951 map and an Alice in Wonderland walk-through attraction was on a 1953 map.\n\nThe Alice in Wonderland ride debuted at Disneyland in 1958 and the Haunted Mansion opened in 1969.\n\nThe opening day Autopia attraction was initially called Drive Yourself Freeway.",

      "text": "Sometimes, the wildest stories in theme parks happen behind the scenes.\nA federal court case in Oklahoma offers stunning allegations that promise to fuel industry cocktail party chatter for a generation. The case involves the American Heartland theme park \u2014 a development that was announced a couple of years ago for a site in rural Oklahoma.\nA group out of Branson, Mo., Mansion Entertainment Group, in 2023 announced what it called a $2 billion project, featuring attractions designed by some of the top contractors in the theme park industry. If that name sounds familiar, Mansion Entertainment Group presented the Grand Finale float in Pasadena\u2019s Tournament of Roses Parade for the past three years.\nThe park was supposed to open next year. But today, all that stands on the site are faded signs and a fence. So what happened?\nAs is typical in business, it\u2019s all about the money. The plaintiff in the lawsuit, a 91-year-old Florida man named Gene Bicknell, contends that people at Mansion and their partners defrauded him out of $60 million. He claims that the defendants impersonated God to send him electronic messages demanding money for the theme park project, which he then provided.\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but I thought that the only investment advice God ever provided was to sell all you own and help the poor. Of all people, you would have thought that I would have caught the part about investing in theme parks, but \u2026 alas.\nThe lawsuit alleges that the defendants had every intention to build the park \u2014 and pay themselves fat salaries along the way, provided that Bicknell kept paying. But when Bicknell ran out of money, that was it. Bicknell claims the deal also cost him family relationships and contributed to a stroke.\nAt some point, this lawsuit will be heard or settled. But show business is littered with stories of people who came in with big dreams only to find nightmares. Whether you have sympathy for the parties in this lawsuit or not, I feel for the designers and creators who put months of effort into envisioning attractions and lands for this park, only now to wonder if they ever will be paid for that work.\nTop theme parks bring in billions of dollars in revenue each year. That kind of money blinds people and communities to the skepticism that they should be bringing when someone comes along and promises to build the next Disneyland.\nRemember, no one needs a theme park vacation. This is not food, water, shelter or medical treatment. As one industry legend once said to me, \u201cwe still are not that far away from carnival barkers.\u201d\nTo open a park, you need to sell people on the dreams come to life within. Only to keep the park open do you need to deliver them. Throughout show business, some people have figured out that you just need the sales pitch if all you want to do is make a quick buck from a mark.\nAnd what more powerful source could there be for that pitch than God?"

      "text": "Disneyland unveiled a new marquee attraction starring a robotic version of Walt Disney that has been seven years in development and was delayed several months so Walt Disney Imagineering could continue to work on the Audio-Animatronic figure of the park\u2019s visionary founder.\nDisneyland showcased \u201cWalt Disney \u2014 A Magical Life\u201d during a media preview on Monday, July 14 in the Main Street Opera House at the Anaheim theme park.\n\u201cWalt Disney \u2013 A Magical Life\u201d will debut to the general public on Thursday, July 17 \u2014 the 70th anniversary of Disneyland\u2019s grand opening in 1955.\nDisneyland will use a virtual queue and not offer a standby queue during the initial opening days of \u201cWalt Disney \u2014 A Magical Life.\u201d\nDisneyland visitors will have two chances a day to join the virtual queue via the Disneyland app \u2014 at 7 a.m. before the park opens and again at noon. You\u2019ll need to have already entered Disneyland to join the noon queue.\nThe new show begins with a 15-minute adaptation of the \u201cWalt Disney: One Man\u2019s Dream\u201d documentary film that has played for more than two decades at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios in Florida and has been re-edited for the new Disneyland presentation.\nIn the short film, Walt tells the story in his own words from his Missouri childhood to the creation of Mickey Mouse, his animation and film career and the opening of Disneyland.After the film, the screen rises to reveal the new animatronic of Walt Disney leaning against the edge of his desk in his office suite on the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank.The show concludes with a two-minute visit with an animatronic Walt as he talks about how he got started, his thoughts on his career and his dreams for the future.\nThe project has stirred some controversy with one of Walt Disney\u2019s grandkids concerned about him becoming a \u201crobotic grampa.\u201d\nJoanna Miller, the child of Walt\u2019s daughter Diane Disney Miller, started a letter-writing campaign to convince Imagineering to abandon plans to create an audio-animatronic version of Walt Disney.\n\u201cThe idea of a Robotic Grampa to give the public a feeling of who the living man was just makes no sense,\u201d Miller wrote on Facebook. \u201cIt would be an imposter. They are dehumanizing him. People are not replaceable.\u201d\nThe Walt Disney Family Museum board of directors \u2014 which includes five of Walt\u2019s grandchildren and three of his great grandchildren \u2014 support the creation of the new audio-animatronic for the \u201cWalt Disney \u2013 A Magical Life\u201d show coming to Disneyland.\nExamples Audio-Animatronics are on display among other \ufffcDisney memorabilia at the Main Street Opera House during \u201cWalt Disney \u2013 A Magical Life\u201d inside Disneyland on July 14, 2025, in Anaheim, CA.

Restaurants ran out of food and drink. A plumbers\u2019 strike meant drinking fountains were in short supply. Long lines formed at bathrooms. Bunting hid unfinished attractions. Women\u2019s high-heeled shoes sank into the fresh asphalt.\nDisneyland will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the original Disney theme park on July 17 with the debut of the new \u201cWalt Disney \u2013 A Magical Life\u201d audio-animatronic show.\nRELATED: Disneyland has a whole lotta \u2018Happy\u2019 going on during 70th birthday bash\nIn 1954, Walt Disney had promised to open Disneyland within a year. It was a pledge most called impossible \u2014 if not downright crazy.\nGroundbreaking took place in July 1954 on a 160-acre orange grove in Anaheim about 22 miles south of Los Angeles.\nThe project was plagued with problems almost from the outset. Costs skyrocketed to $17 million. Hollywood dubbed Disneyland \u201cWalt\u2019s Folly.\u201d Amusement park operators predicted a spectacular failure.\nWalt walked the site daily to offer direction and encouragement, often spending the night in a furnished apartment above Disneyland\u2019s fire station as opening day drew nearer.\nBy the final month, 1,200 workers were toiling at breakneck speed to complete the project on time \u2014 if not on budget.\nDisneyland wasn\u2019t ready on opening day, but Walt decided to open the gates anyway to the media, sponsors, studio employees and invited guests. Traffic was backed up for seven miles on the Santa Ana Freeway. The 15,000 expected guests mushroomed to 28,154 thanks to scores of counterfeit tickets.\nThe crowds weren\u2019t supposed to enter the park until the afternoon. Color coded tickets were intended to stagger arrivals \u2014 silver at 2:30 p.m., green at 5:30 p.m., white at 6 p.m. Visitors ignored the colors and times and rushed to enter the park. One enterprising man leaned a ladder against a fence and charged $5 to climb inside the park.\nCarpenters, landscapers and painters worked right up until the beginning of the 90-minute live television broadcast on ABC. The chaos was captured by 24 cameras spread throughout the park.\nWalt arrived at the opening ceremonies at the throttle of the E.P. Ripley locomotive. Art Linkletter, one of the broadcast hosts, stood on the train station platform and proclaimed Disneyland the \u201c8th Wonder of the World.\u201d Crowds thronged Main Street U.S.A. for a welcome parade with a marching band led by a trio of Autopia cars and Walt riding an antique vehicle.\nTemperatures reached 87 degrees \u2014 one of the hottest July days on record in Anaheim at the time. The Firehouse Five Plus Two jazz band made up of Disney animators sunk in the asphalt that had been laid that morning.\nTempers flared as TV crews cordoned off areas for remote broadcasts. Fantasyland, Adventureland, Frontierland and Tomorrowland closed and reopened as Walt dedicated each land for the television audience.\nRides and exhibits were incomplete. Bathrooms were unavailable due to construction. Areas were roped off with signs that read \u201cTo Be Open Soon.\u201d\nFlames licked at Sleeping Beauty Castle because of a gas leak. Water washed across the overloaded deck of the Mark Twain Riverboat. Anaheim Police were called in to assist 15 lost children.\nRonald Reagan, one of the television broadcast hosts, was forced to scale the wall of Frontierland to make one of his scheduled appearances.\nAt one point, Walt got locked in his apartment above the fire station and couldn\u2019t get out.\nWalt never intended for Disneyland\u2019s official opening day to be on July 17, 1955 \u2014 which had been dubbed as an invitation-only International Press Preview.\nDisneyland\u2019s opening day was advertised in newspapers as July 18, 1955 when the park would officially open to the general public.\nThere were no admission tickets sold on July 17 when rides were free to invited guests.\nNewspaper accounts all recorded July 18, 1955 as the official opening day when more than 50,000 paying customers pressed into Disneyland at 10 a.m. when the park opened to the public for the first time.\nWalt\u2019s brother Roy bought the first ticket. General admission tickets cost $1 for adults and 50 cents for children under 12. Each ride or attraction cost 10 to 50 cents.\nWalt posed for a publicity photo on July 18, 1955 with Christine Vess, 5, of North Hollywood, and her cousin Michael Schwartner, 7, of Bakersfield, as the first official visitors of Disneyland.\nFor decades, Disneyland marked July 18, 1955 as the official opening day for the park. While they were alive, Walt and Roy always insisted July 18 was the official opening day of the park. It wasn\u2019t until the 25th anniversary of the park in 1980 that Disneyland began marking July 17 as the \u201cofficial\u201d opening date, bending to the legend and making it fact.\nAs a result of the confusion, retrospective press accounts have blended events from July 17 and 18 into a single narrative that may never be sorted out.\nAfter the madness of the twin opening days, Disney and his new park were roundly criticized in the press. Newspaper headlines declared: \u201cWalt\u2019s Nightmare.\u201d The media predicted a quick and early demise.\nThe public didn\u2019t listen.\nVisitors arrived in droves and within weeks Disneyland was a success. A slew of rides that weren\u2019t ready for opening day \u2014 like Rocket to the Moon and Dumbo the Flying Elephant \u2014 debuted over the next few months.\nWithin two months, the park had welcomed its 1 millionth visitor. By its first anniversary, attendance stood at 3,642,597.\nSeventy years later, Disneyland\u2019s popularity continues to grow, with total overall attendance for the Anaheim theme park resort nearing 1 billion and showing no signs of slowing down.\nThe information in this retrospective account has been drawn from \u201cThe Disneyland Story\u201d by Sam Gennawey, Disney D23 Fan Club, Yesterland, MousePlanet, Orange County Register archives and other published reports."

      "text": "More than six years after shuttering a decades-old aquarium, SeaWorld is reviving the aquatic habitat with new species of fish and a conservation campaign aimed at educating the public about illegal trafficking of animals.\nThe refurbished Bayside Aquarium, which will make its debut on Friday, replaces the former Marine Aquarium, which originally opened in 1965 \u2014 a year after the park opened on Mission Bay. At the time the former aquarium closed in 2019, the park offered little explanation as to why, other than to say that SeaWorld regularly refreshes different areas of its park.\nSeaWorld spokesperson Tracy Spahr said Tuesday that the main reason for the closure was to \u201cconsolidate aquarium efforts.\u201d\nThe good news, says SeaWorld\u2019s zoological curator, is the revived attraction will feature a number of different species distinct from the previous aquarium, among them the critically endangered axolotl, a unique amphibian native to lakes near Mexico City. The refurbished aquarium, which is basically composed of six separate glass aquariums, will feature at least 10 aquatic species, said Danielle Castillo, curator of zoological operations.\nThe previous aquarium, she said, tended to focus more on cephalapods like octopuses, nautiluses and cuttlefish.\n\u201cThis time around, we\u2019re bringing the aquarium back as a way to focus on our conservation efforts and give guests an up-close look at very unique animals,\u201d Castillo explained. \u201cWe also have a pilot program called Wildlife Confiscation Network, which is from the Wildlife Trafficking Alliance that we just started in the past few years. What that network allows us to do is have a strong network of facilities \u2014 from universities to other accredited zoos and aquariums \u2014 that will help wildlife enforcement with being able to find a home for illegally trafficked animals so they can thrive.\u201d\nAmong the aquatic species featured in the updated aquarium are a range of freshwater and saltwater species, including the camouflaged wobbegong shark, a California two-spot octopus, brown-banded bamboo sharks, coral cat sharks and reef fish. While each of the individual six aquariums will be dedicated to different species, the reef fish will be seen in more than one tank.\nCastillo is especially excited about the axolotl and she expects children will be as well.\n\u201cThey\u2019re very interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can regenerate limbs, and their gills are on the outside of their heads. But it\u2019s also important to us to get the messaging out about the illegal trafficking and also educate people on why it\u2019s important to take care of their natural environment and be responsible pet owners.\u201d\nLocated beneath the park\u2019s Bayside Amphitheater, the 458-square-foot aquarium holds 2,000 gallons of water, and part of the reimagined attraction includes new interior habitats for each of the six aquariums. There is also a lot more signage and information designed around the exhibit\u2019s educational messaging, SeaWorld says.\nAmong the park\u2019s eight aquariums, Bayside is one of the smallest, but it also provides the public with one of the more close-up, intimate experiences in terms of seeing the fish inside, Castillo said.\nThe new inhabitants, she said, come from a variety of sources, like other aquariums and from rescues. And the brown banded bamboo sharks were born in the park."

      "text": "The aesthetic design of Marvel\u2018s new \u201cFantastic Four: First Steps\u201d film opening in theaters this week draws inspiration from the optimistic, mid-century modern vision of the future and was heavily influenced by the look of Disneyland\u2019s Tomorrowland.\nWhich raises the obvious question: Does Walt Disney Imagineering have plans for a Fantastic Four makeover of Tomorrowland?\nThe \u201cFantastic Four: First Steps\u201d film debuting on Friday, July 25 stars Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm/Human Torch and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm/Thing.\nFantastic Four meet-and-greet characters Mr. Fantastic, The Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, The Thing and the Herbie robot assistant will make appearances in Tomorrowland at Disneyland starting on July 25.\nThe Space Mountain facade will be bathed in Fantastic Four projection lighting effects at night and Tomorrowland restaurants will sell movie themed food and a Clobberin\u2019 Time sipper in the shape of The Thing\u2019s fist.\nDisneyland has not announced any plans for a Fantastic Four makeover of Tomorrowland.\nDisney and Marvel executives have hinted the Fantastic Four film might inspire a future reimagining of Tomorrowland, according to MiceChat.\n\u201cWhile no official Tomorrowland redo has been announced, the connection between the film\u2019s futuristic aesthetic and Tomorrowland\u2019s legacy suggests that Imagineering could be eyeing a refresh down the road,\u201d according to MiceChat.\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige revealed in March that Walt Disney\u2019s visions for Tomorrowland and Epcot served as inspirations for \u201cFantastic Four: First Steps\u201d during a presentation at the South By Southwest conference in Austin.\n\u201cJust like my colleagues at the other studios, I\u2019m a giant, giant Disney parks fan,\u201d Feige said at SXSW. \u201cI\u2019m always drawn to the places that showcase Walt\u2019s vision for the future \u2014 particularly Tomorrowland and Epcot. They share a mid-century, retro-futuristic design language that I love.\u201d\nImagineering Chief Creative Officer Bruce Vaughn announced during SXSW that Imagineers were working on a Herbie robot that would make appearances in Disneyland\u2019s Tomorrowland alongside Fantastic Four meet-and-greet characters.\n\u201cThis is what is so great about our teams collaborating the way they do,\u201d Vaughn said at SXSW. \u201cWe\u2019re always coming up with crazy ideas that we know our guests will love.\u201d\nThe Marvel Studios design team used the architecture of the 1964 New York World\u2019s Fair to create a retro-future for the new \u201cFantastic Four\u201d film set in a 1960s alternate universe that never existed, according to Feige.\n\u201cThat entire movie is inspired in large part by the optimism and the forward-looking nature of the \u201864 World\u2019s Fair,\u201d Feige said during a 2024 D23 panel in Anaheim. \u201cThat\u2019s what the \u2018Fantastic Four\u2019 movie is attempting to be.\u201d\nThe Carousel of Progress created by Imagineering for the 1964 World\u2019s Fair was relocated to Disneyland\u2019s Tomorrowland and the Ford\u2019s Magic Skyway inspired the futuristic theme land\u2019s PeopleMover.\nAdopting the retro-futuristic look of \u201cFantastic Four: First Steps\u201d would make Disneyland\u2019s Tomorrowland more timeless, according to Cinema Blend.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect look for Tomorrowland,\u201d according to Cinema Blend. \u201cTomorrowland doesn\u2019t need to become a Fantastic Four land. It can still be a Tomorrowland, just a different world\u2019s view of tomorrow.\u201d\nEven the Disney Parks Blog appears to be offering up ideas for Tomorrowland attraction makeovers.\n\u201cWith a love of adventure and high thrills, you would think the Human Torch would be racing through the cosmos to the edge of the galaxy on Space Mountain,\u201d according to the Disney Parks Blog.\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine where the Fantastic Four could settle down in Tomorrowland.\nA Human Torch takeover of Space Mountain makes sense. The Disneyland Monorail and Autopia could easily get Fantastic Four overlays based on the new film.\nConcept art for \u201cFantastic Four: First Steps\u201d shows a monorail with a silver nose cone and baby blue pinstripe weaving through retro-futuristic cityscapes.\nThe Fantasticar in the new movie has a Jetsons-style look based on mid-1960s American concept cars with turbine intakes on the front and back and a bubble dome for a roof.\nTomorrowland\u2019s Galactic Grill could offer up a Fantastic Four menu with Fantastic Elastic mozzarella sticks and Invisible Indulgence clear lemon pie.\nThe Tomorrowland Theater, Star Wars Launch Bay and PeopleMover track all sit underused and in need of some Imagineering pixie dust.\nOf course, the new \u201cFantastic Four\u201d movie will need to be a sequel-spawning blockbuster hit in order for Imagineering to even think about a Tomorrowland makeover based on the burgeoning film franchise.\nSo far, the signs look good for the film with strong critical reviews, a $100 million-plus opening weekend forecast and a budget north of $200 million. Now all that\u2019s left is to see if \u201cFirst Steps\u201d becomes the latest Disney film to cross the $1 billion box office threshold \u2014 joining \u201cMoana 2,\u201d \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d\nIf that happens, expect to hear more talk about a Fantastic Four makeover of Tomorrowland at Disneyland."

      "text": "A man called out on social media for hurling a racial slur while standing in line for a ride at Knott\u2019s Berry Farm and then later getting into a fight has apparently lost his job with a Riverside County water district.\nA video of the July 12 incident, widely circulated on TikTok and Instagram, shows the man, accompanied by a woman, calling a patron a (expletive) wetback\u201d after some kind of dispute. In another video recorded at Knott\u2019s, the same man appears to be involved in a physical altercation.\n@wild6outlawrealityshow #duet with @SD_Slick #knottsberryfarm\n\u266c As\u00ed Fue \u2013 En Vivo Desde Bellas Artes, M\u00e9xico/ 2013 \u2013 Juan Gabriel\nKnott\u2019s security personnel responded and removed the man from the park for the remainder of the day. It is unknown if he faces criminal charges. The Southern California News Group has not independently confirmed the man\u2019s identity, and it is unknown what prompted the racially charged incident and subsequent fight.\nAs a result of the incident, the man no longer works at the Eastern Municipal Water District in Perris.\n\u201cEMWD is committed to guiding principles that include respect, integrity, accountability, and maintaining a safe environment for all employees, customers, and the communities we serve,\u201d the water district said in a statement Friday, July 25. \u201cWe remain dedicated to our mission, vision, and guiding principles to provide safe, reliable services to our customers and ensuring that every individual is treated with dignity and respect.\u201d\nIn a separate Knott\u2019s incident caught on video also on July 12, a woman \u2014 also waiting in line \u2014 made racist comments to a ride operator and a family, as well as threatened to call U.S. immigration officers.\n@mlfmnyyyy This woman was upset that my family and I occupied the seat she wanted, and when the ride operator stood her ground and told her she already assigned us to the seat, she began threatening her with calling immigration. The operator calmly explained that if she was going to be disrespectful, that she would be calling security. This woman decided to cross her arms and refuse to leave the ride. I told her to get off the ride and stop acting like a child, to which she responded that she should call immigration on the both of us. Which escalated into both parts of this video. NEVER STAY QUIET. NEVER BACK DOWN TO BULLIES. ROAR. YELL. CALL THEM OUT. She later referred to me as a whore, a wetback, and other things I can\u2019t even remember because I was trying not to physically escalate this situation. Thank you to all riders who approached me with encouragement and support afterward & don\u2019t forget the ride operator who was forced to continue working after being verbally abused by this woman. How about we normalize telling wyte people to go back to their country? I bet you she has no idea where her ancestors are from, cause it surely isn\u2019t North America.\nKnott\u2019s security personnel quickly responded and made contact with the woman, who was banned from the park for life.\n\u201cProviding a safe, respectful, and family-friendly atmosphere is the type of experience our guests expect and deserve and is a responsibility that the park takes very seriously,\u201d Knott\u2019s said in a statement. \u201cWe have zero tolerance for any type of inappropriate behavior.\u201d"
