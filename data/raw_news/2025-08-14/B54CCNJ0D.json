  "content": "A SAVVY mum has shared a \u201cgenius\u201d trick to guarantee there are no tears when applying sun cream.\n\nNot only does it make the process much more fun for youngsters, but if your little one hates having sun cream applied, then you\u2019ll need to check this out.\n\nWith this simple tip, which has been hailed the \u201cbest sun cream hack ever,\u201d you\u2019ll need an unexpected kitchen essential.\n\nPosting on social media, Gemma McCartan, a mum-of-two and full-time content creator from the UK, gave her followers a close-up look at her trick, which involves using spoons when applying spray sun cream.\n\nAlongside her short video, the influencer beamed: \u201cThe best sun cream hack for kids EVER.\u201d\n\nShe then said: \u201cTo the mum who posted this, I love you.\u201d\n\nInstead of wrestling her son Max to close his eyes so she could apply the spray sun cream to his face, the youngster instead put two spoons over his eyes.\n\nGemma was then able to spray his face with sun cream, without it getting in his eyes and causing any tears.\n\nMoments after, the woman's daughter then did the same, yet again ensuring a seamless application with no irritation of the eyes, whilst at the same time, making the often agonising process much more exciting.\n\nThrilled with her hack, Gemma later wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s been a game changer.\u201d\n\nClearly beaming with the simple trick, the mother added: \u201cIt\u2019s made my day, I had the kids crying on holiday until we found this hack.\u201d\n\nGemma\u2019s TikTok clip, which was posted under the username @gemmamccartan, has clearly left many open-mouthed, as it has quickly racked up 200,800 views.\n\nNot only this, but it\u2019s also amassed 2,074 likes and 138 comments.\n\nParents were impressed with the \u201cgenius\u201d trick and many thought it was a \u201cgreat\u201d idea.\n\nWhilst a third commented: \u201cNot only practical, it gives the kids a feeling of control over what's about to happen, so they are more willing to cooperate. Great idea.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, someone else gushed: \u201cBest idea ever for sun cream.\u201d\n\nThe importance of sun cream in your skincare routine Dermatologist and skincare enthusiast Andrea Suarez - known as Dr Dray - revealed why you should wear suncream. The one thing you can do that will make the biggest difference - and this matters for all ages - is protecting your skin from the sun, Andrea stressed. \"The vast majority of external aging is due to exposure to ultraviolet radiation,\" she continued, not because you're \"not using some jazzy serum or layering 90 different things on your face everyday\". \"If you're not doing in your 20s, get on that now.\" But she said the use of sun cream alone doesn't go far enough. Andrea urged that you also wear sun-protective clothing like broad-brimmed hats and long sleeves, on top of not staying out too long in the sun. Doing this over your lifetime - and all year, not just during the summer or on sunny days - \"will reduce the visible signs of photoageing\", Andrea said. Those are wrinkles, muddled pigmentation and sagging skin.\n\nHowever, at the same time, one user wrote: \u201cShould have cream on eyelids too as they can burn, I know it stings if it gets in eyes but it\u2019s such a sensitive area so best to have full coverage.\u201d\n\nTo this, Gemma wrote back and explained: \u201cYes but my son has allergies so this is amazing.\u201d\n\nNot only this, but another person asked: \u201cWon't they get a burnt line where the handles are?\u201d\n\nIn response, Gemma confirmed that instead of spraying the sun cream on her youngster\u2019s eyelids, after the fun part, she then uses her finger for a more controlled application, as she acknowledged: \"I use my finger to do the sides and lids.\u201d\n\nUnlock even more award-winning articles as The Sun launches brand new membership programme - Sun Club",
