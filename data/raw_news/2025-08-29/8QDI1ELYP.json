  "description": "The company's trajectory in recent years suggests one clear answer.",
  "content": "\u2022 Tilray's industry position and prospects of regulatory progress could make its shares attractive.\n\u2022 However, the company faces a barrage of headwinds and a poor track record of performance.\n\u2022 Despite some signs for optimism, the stock still looks far too risky -- even at its current price.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Tilray Brands \u203a Penny stocks -- companies trading under $5 per share -- tend to be that cheap for a reason: The market doesn't have much faith in them. However, there is the occasional penny stock that, against most odds, manages to soar past those levels and deliver market-beating returns to investors who got in when it was still changing hands for pocket change. The challenge is to separate the wheat from the very abundant chaff. With that said, let's consider one penny stock, Tilray Brands (NASDAQ: TLRY), that has taken its shareholders on a volatile ride over the past five years. Is the company cheap at current levels, or is it a stock investors should stay far away from? Let's find out. Tilray Brands is the leading player in the Canadian cannabis market in terms of revenue. It maintained the top spot during its fiscal 2025 year, which ended on May 31. The company's portfolio includes products across several categories, from pre-rolls to vapes and cannabis-infused drinks. Further, Tilray has significantly expanded beyond its core operations over the past few years. The company's portfolio is now well-diversified across cannabis, hemp-based wellness products, the resale of pharmaceuticals, and significant craft brewing operations in the U.S. During fiscal 2025, Tilray's revenue increased by 4% year over year to $821.3 million. Tilray's beverage business performed particularly well, growing its sales by 19% year over year to $240.6 million, and now making up 29% of the top line versus 25% in the previous year. Although revenue growth is still not that strong -- and Tilray remains unprofitable -- those bullish on the stock might point out that the company could benefit from regulatory progress in the cannabis industry. Tilray's shares recently soared on news that President Trump was considering reclassifying cannabis from a Schedule 1 to a Schedule 3 substance. Those that are in the former category are considered to be more dangerous and have a higher potential for abuse. This change, if implemented, could enable Tilray and its peers to secure funding more easily than they have been able to so far and help them expand their operations. Tilray's CEO, Irwin Simon, even predicted that full-blown marijuana legalization would happen at the federal level by the end of Trump's presidency.\n\nTilray already has significant operations in the cannabis and craft brewing markets in the country, including a solid, established distribution network. The company would use that to hit the ground running faster than smaller competitors if legalization does happen. Lastly, Tilray also has significant operations in other countries, including Germany, and could also benefit from loosening regulations abroad. Germany recently made some progress toward that when it allowed recreational use of cannabis for adults last year. Tilray's established brands and significant footprints in the industry could help it benefit if the cannabis sector takes off in the long run. Why have Tilray's shares performed as poorly as they have over the past few years despite the opportunities available to the company? There are several reasons. First, even as regulators have loosened restrictions on recreational cannabis, this has not necessarily translated into a significant market opportunity. For instance, although cannabis use is now legal for adults in Germany, it remains illegal for retailers to sell the substance. People have to grow it at home or buy it from a cannabis club they join. Clubs are only allowed to sell it to their members and have to operate as nonprofit organizations. Even if President Trump does decide to reclassify cannabis in the U.S., this might not lead to a significant rise in demand for marijuana. Second, even if there is a market opportunity resulting from legalization or less stringent regulations, laws can still be in place that restrict this opportunity. In the U.S., reclassification wouldn't fix the fact that it's illegal to transport cannabis products across state lines. In Canada, legalization was accompanied by a range of other regulatory requirements, including the need to obtain proper licenses. This slowed down the progress of cannabis companies in the country. Third, legalization has invited significant competition before, and it will again if it happens in the U.S. While Tilray has managed to become the top player in Canada, this has come at a cost. It has achieved this partly through acquisitions; however, since it remains unprofitable, it has also had to issue new shares to help fund its acquisition spree, resulting in dilution for existing shareholders. Lastly, the company's performance in the past five years hardly inspires confidence. Tilray's revenue growth has been volatile, and profitability remains elusive. Of course, that's in the past. It does not mean the company will continue to struggle in the future. However, when we consider that, along with all the other headwinds the company will face in the industry, the cannabis specialist looks unlikely to recover. So, Tilray isn't a cheap stock since those who invest in the company today could be left with worthless shares in five years or so. Investors should steer clear of the company.

      "text": "Invest better with The Motley Fool. Get stock recommendations, portfolio guidance, and more from The Motley Fool's premium services.\nInvesting in Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock in recent years hasn't been for the faint of heart. Shares of the global cannabis company have soared -- and they've sunk. Today, though, Tilray Brands is arguably among the companies best positioned to profit as cannabis is legalized in more places.\nIn this article, we'll cover how to invest in Tilray. You'll also learn factors to consider in deciding whether the marijuana stock is a good pick for your investment portfolio.\nInvesting in marijuana stocks such as Tilray is really no different from investing in any stock. There are four basic steps to follow:\nYou'll first need to open a brokerage account. In the past, interactions with brokers were primarily done over the phone or in person. Today, transactions are usually conducted online.\nThere are quite a few brokerages from which you can choose. They offer services that are quite similar. However, there are a few differentiating factors, including:\nIt's important to know how much money you can afford to invest in Tilray (or any other stock, for that matter). The best way to determine this amount is to budget. If you don't already have a budget, you'll want to list all your sources of income along with how much income they generate. Also, identify all your ongoing expenses.\nIt's wise to do your research before any major purchase, whether we're talking about a house, a car, a new computer, or a stock. What kind of research should you specifically do with respect to Tilray?\nFirst, read through the investor presentations available on its website. They'll give you a sense of Tilray's business strategy.\nThoroughly examine Tilray's most recent 10-K annual reports and its 10-Q quarterly reports. These regulatory filings will help you better understand the company's financial condition. The 10-K reports will also provide a pretty good picture of the risks that Tilray faces.\nCheck out any transcripts that are available from Tilray's quarterly conference calls as well. These usually include the prepared remarks for the company's chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (and sometimes other executives), plus a question-and-answer session with analysts. The comments made in the conference calls can sometimes reveal more about what's going on with the company and where it's headed than you'll be able to find out elsewhere.\nYou'll also definitely want to look at Tilray's key financial and valuation metrics. In particular, look at the company's cash position. Cannabis companies, in general, often burn through their cash and turn to stock offerings to raise additional capital. This causes the value of existing shares to be diluted.\nThe exact process involved with placing an order to buy Tilray stock will vary somewhat depending on which brokerage you use. However, the steps shouldn\u2019t be too different between brokerages. The following screenshot describes how you can place an order to buy a stock with Fidelity, one of the leading online brokerages.\nThe trading symbol (or stock ticker) for Tilray is TLRY. If purchasing fractional shares is supported by your brokerage, you\u2019ll need to specify the dollar amount you want to invest. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to enter the number of shares you want to buy.\nMost, if not all, brokerages will ask you to specify which order type you prefer -- market order or limit order. What\u2019s the difference between these order types? Market orders allow the transaction to be executed immediately at the current market price. Limit orders for purchases will be executed only if and when the stock trades at or below the specified share price. The Motley Fool recommends using market orders to ensure that trades are executed immediately.\nThe answer depends on you.\nProbably the most important factor in answering this question is your risk tolerance. Cannabis stocks tend to be highly volatile and quite risky. Tilray is no exception.\nThe company must pay high excise taxes in Canada. Tilray can't expand into the U.S. cannabis market because doing so would cause the company to lose its listing on the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) stock exchange.\nThere's uncertainty about whether Tilray's aggressive acquisitions strategy will pay off. The company acquired Montauk Brewing in November 2022. It bought Hexo in June 2023. In October 2023, Tilray acquired eight craft beer brands from Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD).\nOn the other hand, Tilray could have tremendous long-term growth prospects. Fortune Business Insights predicts that the global cannabis market will increase by a compound annual growth rate of 34% to more than $444 billion by 2030.\nTilray appears well positioned to benefit from this projected growth. The company claims the No. 1 market share in the Canadian cannabis market. It has an early-mover advantage in Europe, with operations in Portugal and Germany.\nThere are two potential catalysts that could be especially important for Tilray on this front. Germany, which already has a thriving medical cannabis market, legalized adult-use marijuana in 2024, although the market remains limited due to strict regulations. The U.S. could also legalize cannabis at the federal level at some point.\nCannabis isn't the only opportunity for Tilray, though. Beverage alcohol could become just as big a business for the company in the not-too-distant future. Thanks to the brands it bought from Anheuser-Busch, Tilray now ranks as the fifth-largest craft brewer in the U.S.\nTilray isn't profitable at this point. However, the company is already generating positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) -- an important prerequisite for achieving profitability.\nMost cannabis stocks don't have dividend programs. Tilray is no exception. Investors probably shouldn't expect the company to initiate a dividend anytime soon.\nMore than 20 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) currently hold positions in Tilray. They include:\nIt isn't just marijuana ETFs that own shares of Tilray, however. Other ETFs with positions in the stock include:\nWhile several companies have recently conducted stock splits, Tilray isn't in the group. The company has never conducted a stock split in its history and has not announced any plans to do so.\nTilray is highly volatile stock that operates in a challenging industry. However, the company could have tremendous long-term growth prospects in the global cannabis market and with its expansion into beverage alcohol.\n*Average returns of all recommendations since inception.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Is Tilray Brands a Dirt Cheap Growth Stock or Just a Bad Buy?\nBy Prosper Junior Bakiny \u2013 Aug 29, 2025 at 7:45AM\nNASDAQ: TLRY\nTilray Brands\nMarket Cap\n$1.6B\nToday's Change\n(7.30%) $0.10\nCurrent Price\n$1.47\nPrice as of August 28, 2025 at 8:00 PM ET\nInvest better with The Motley Fool. Get stock recommendations, portfolio guidance, and more from The Motley Fool's premium services.\nPenny stocks -- companies trading under $5 per share -- tend to be that cheap for a reason: The market doesn't have much faith in them. However, there is the occasional penny stock that, against most odds, manages to soar past those levels and deliver market-beating returns to investors who got in when it was still changing hands for pocket change. The challenge is to separate the wheat from the very abundant chaff.\nWith that said, let's consider one penny stock, Tilray Brands (TLRY +0.07%), that has taken its shareholders on a volatile ride over the past five years. Is the company cheap at current levels, or is it a stock investors should stay far away from? Let's find out.\nTilray Brands is the leading player in the Canadian cannabis market in terms of revenue. It maintained the top spot during its fiscal 2025 year, which ended on May 31. The company's portfolio includes products across several categories, from pre-rolls to vapes and cannabis-infused drinks. Further, Tilray has significantly expanded beyond its core operations over the past few years. The company's portfolio is now well-diversified across cannabis, hemp-based wellness products, the resale of pharmaceuticals, and significant craft brewing operations in the U.S.\nDuring fiscal 2025, Tilray's revenue increased by 4% year over year to $821.3 million. Tilray's beverage business performed particularly well, growing its sales by 19% year over year to $240.6 million, and now making up 29% of the top line versus 25% in the previous year.\nAlthough revenue growth is still not that strong -- and Tilray remains unprofitable -- those bullish on the stock might point out that the company could benefit from regulatory progress in the cannabis industry. Tilray's shares recently soared on news that President Trump was considering reclassifying cannabis from a Schedule 1 to a Schedule 3 substance.\nThose that are in the former category are considered to be more dangerous and have a higher potential for abuse. This change, if implemented, could enable Tilray and its peers to secure funding more easily than they have been able to so far and help them expand their operations. Tilray's CEO, Irwin Simon, even predicted that full-blown marijuana legalization would happen at the federal level by the end of Trump's presidency.\nTilray already has significant operations in the cannabis and craft brewing markets in the country, including a solid, established distribution network. The company would use that to hit the ground running faster than smaller competitors if legalization does happen. Lastly, Tilray also has significant operations in other countries, including Germany, and could also benefit from loosening regulations abroad. Germany recently made some progress toward that when it allowed recreational use of cannabis for adults last year.\nTilray's established brands and significant footprints in the industry could help it benefit if the cannabis sector takes off in the long run.\nWhy have Tilray's shares performed as poorly as they have over the past few years despite the opportunities available to the company? There are several reasons. First, even as regulators have loosened restrictions on recreational cannabis, this has not necessarily translated into a significant market opportunity. For instance, although cannabis use is now legal for adults in Germany, it remains illegal for retailers to sell the substance. People have to grow it at home or buy it from a cannabis club they join. Clubs are only allowed to sell it to their members and have to operate as nonprofit organizations.\nEven if President Trump does decide to reclassify cannabis in the U.S., this might not lead to a significant rise in demand for marijuana. Second, even if there is a market opportunity resulting from legalization or less stringent regulations, laws can still be in place that restrict this opportunity.\nIn the U.S., reclassification wouldn't fix the fact that it's illegal to transport cannabis products across state lines. In Canada, legalization was accompanied by a range of other regulatory requirements, including the need to obtain proper licenses. This slowed down the progress of cannabis companies in the country.\nThird, legalization has invited significant competition before, and it will again if it happens in the U.S. While Tilray has managed to become the top player in Canada, this has come at a cost. It has achieved this partly through acquisitions; however, since it remains unprofitable, it has also had to issue new shares to help fund its acquisition spree, resulting in dilution for existing shareholders. Lastly, the company's performance in the past five years hardly inspires confidence. Tilray's revenue growth has been volatile, and profitability remains elusive.\nOf course, that's in the past. It does not mean the company will continue to struggle in the future. However, when we consider that, along with all the other headwinds the company will face in the industry, the cannabis specialist looks unlikely to recover. So, Tilray isn't a cheap stock since those who invest in the company today could be left with worthless shares in five years or so. Investors should steer clear of the company.\n*Average returns of all recommendations since inception. Cost basis and return based on previous market day close."

      "text": "The marijuana industry is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 34% through 2030, and many investors are seeking to profit. As states and entire countries decriminalize or legalize cannabis and/or its components, there are growing opportunities for entrepreneurs and existing companies. This is especially true with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) moving to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule 1 controlled substance (no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse) to Schedule 3 (drugs that have moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence).\nAs with any nascent industry, there are also plenty of investment risks. Whether you're a first-time investor or a seasoned veteran, it pays to understand how this industry works. This guide will get you up to speed quickly and includes our picks for the top marijuana stocks.\nBest marijuana stocks for 2025\n1. Green Thumb Industries\nGreen Thumb ranks among the largest cannabis companies in the U.S. It operates more than 100 retail cannabis dispensaries and 20 manufacturing facilities across 14 states.\nThe company has been profitable on an annual basis since 2020. It continues to deliver revenue growth and maintains a strong balance sheet even with headwinds in the economy and cannabis industry. Green Thumb should have plenty of growth potential over the long term as the U.S. cannabis market expands.\nFor now, Green Thumb's shares can only be bought and sold on over-the-counter (OTC) markets in the U.S. However, if federal cannabis restrictions are lifted, the stock could be listed on major U.S. stock exchanges. This would almost certainly be a huge catalyst for Green Thumb.\nOver-the-Counter (OTC)\n2. Trulieve Cannabis\nOTC: TCNNF\nKey Data Points\nTrulieve Cannabis is the largest cannabis retailer in the U.S. It operates 225 retail cannabis stores in eight states with 15 processing facilities in six states.\nThe company dominates the market in its home state of Florida. It also claims market-leading positions in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Support for legalizing recreational marijuana failed to achieve the required 60% threshold in Florida's 2024 elections. However, with almost 56% of the state's voters favoring legalization, Trulieve could still have a significant growth opportunity if the state legalizes recreational marijuana in the future.\nLike Green Thumb, Trulieve's shares can currently only be traded on OTC markets in the U.S. The stock will likely be a big winner if federal marijuana reforms are made that allow U.S. stock exchanges to list the shares of cannabis companies that operate in the U.S.\n3. Innovative Industrial Properties\nNYSE: IIPR\nKey Data Points\nU.S. cannabis companies can't easily secure capital from banks or financial institutions since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. Innovative Industrial Properties (IIP) helps solve the cash shortage for growing marijuana companies. It buys properties owned by U.S. medical cannabis operators and leases the properties back to them. The sale to IIP provides the cannabis operator with much-needed cash, and the lease agreements create a steady revenue stream for IIP.\nInnovative Industrial Properties has grown significantly in recent years and now owns more than 100 properties in 19 states. The company continues to generate solid revenue and earnings powered by its sale-leaseback business model, even with some of its tenants facing financial challenges. Because IIP is organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT), it returns at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders.\nIn some ways, IIP wouldn't be helped as much by federal cannabis reform as other companies. Its shares already trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). If traditional banking services were available to U.S. cannabis operators, IIP could face increased competition. However, federal reforms would likely cause the U.S. cannabis market to expand -- which should work in IIP's favor.\nRevenue\n4. Quest Diagnostics\nQuest Diagnostics might be a surprising pick to include in a list of marijuana stocks. It's one of the world's largest providers of laboratory testing services.\nHow does Quest tie in with the cannabis industry? The widespread legalization of marijuana in states across the U.S. is driving increasing demand for drug testing in the workplace. Quest offers drug testing services and is certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for federally mandated drug testing of workers in some safety-sensitive fields.\nQuest could be an attractive stock for more risk-averse investors who want to profit from the legalization of cannabis. It has a long track record of success and is consistently profitable.\n5. Turning Point Brands\nTurning Point Brands is a leader in supplying smoking accessories and oral tobacco. Its products include Zig-Zag rolling papers, Clipper lighters, and Stoker's and Beechnut tobacco products.\nThe company has especially significant growth opportunities with the legalization of cannabis in the U.S. Turning Point Brands estimates an addressable market of around $200 million in the alternative market for headshops and cannabis dispensaries.\nMarijuana stocks overview\nLet's cover some of the basics you need to know before investing in marijuana stocks.\n- The marijuana industry is divided into three broad categories. Marijuana growers and retailers cultivate and package cannabis products and sell them to consumers. Biotechnology companies develop and market cannabis-based pharmaceutical drugs. Ancillary marijuana businesses provide products and services to cannabis companies without touching the plant.\n- Cannabis can be medical or recreational. Medical cannabis patients use cannabis or cannabis extracts to treat health conditions and have recommendations or cannabis prescriptions from physicians. Recreational cannabis users purchase marijuana or cannabis extracts purely for enjoyment and must be 18 or older and living in a jurisdiction where recreational use of the plant is legal.\n- Geography matters. Medical cannabis is legal in many more countries than recreational cannabis. In the U.S., cannabis remains illegal at the federal level. However, a growing number of states have legalized medical and/or recreational cannabis. And -- as mentioned earlier -- steps are underway to reschedule marijuana. The rapid growth of the U.S. cannabis market is translating into impressive growth by U.S.-based cannabis companies, while marijuana companies in Canada -- where the plant is already fully legal nationwide -- are expanding more slowly. Canada is one of the global legal markets where supply is outpacing demand and leading to falling cannabis prices.\nRelated investing topics\nJust because there's a trendy new sector with lots of press and potential growth doesn't mean you need to invest in it. If you buy broad-based index funds, you're covered no matter which sectors of the stock market do well. Conservative investors who prefer lower risk are likely better off avoiding investing in marijuana stocks.\nSome marijuana stocks can be highly volatile. This highlights why using margin to buy these stocks should be avoided.\nAggressive investors with high risk tolerances, though, will probably find a lot to like about marijuana stocks. The cannabis industry is still in its early stages. The market opportunities are enormous, especially as more U.S. states legalize cannabis. Investing in these stocks is a high-risk but potentially high-reward proposition."

  "argos_summary": "Tilray Brands, the leading Canadian cannabis producer, has seen modest revenue growth but remains unprofitable and faces significant regulatory and competitive headwinds. While potential federal reclassification and international liberalization could boost demand, the company\u2019s heavy dilution, limited retail access, and ongoing legal restrictions dampen upside. Investors are cautioned that the stock\u2019s volatility and lack of clear profitability make it a risky play despite occasional positive catalysts.",
