      "text": "- The annual Jackson Hole summit is the Fed\u2019s most influential forum for signaling global monetary shifts.\n- This year, Powell\u2019s speech could sway rate-cut expectations and test Fed independence under political pressure.\n- See the seasonal trading strategy that's beating the S&P 500 by 6X this year. Details here \u2192\nImagine being Jerome Powell this week. On Friday, August 22, the Federal Reserve chairman will step onto the stage at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium \u2014 the most closely watched monetary retreat in the world \u2014 with markets, politicians, and even building contractors staring him down.\nPresident Donald Trump is pressing him for interest-rate cuts. Congress is questioning Fed independence. Meanwhile, he's weathering criticism about a costly renovation of the central bank's D.C. headquarters. And hanging over it all: Trump and his allies are hyping a successor who pledges to keep cutting rates in 2026.\nNo pressure.\nBut while Powell juggles politics, markets, and Fed renovations, Jackson Hole itself offers a lens into why this remote Wyoming summit has become the epicenter of monetary policy debates \u2014 and why every word matters. From its origins and scenic setting to the historic moments that shaped global markets, here's a closer look at the questions investors and economists keep asking.\nSee Also: Trump Gets FAQ\u2019d By Powell\u2014No Champagne Rooms, Just Clearing Cancer Dust\nWhy Wyoming And Not Kansas?\nThe summit began in 1978 as a Kansas City Fed conference on agriculture. In 1982, organizers moved it to Wyoming to entice Fed Chair Paul Volcker, an avid fly fisherman. Volcker came, and prestige followed. Ever since, Jackson Hole has been the place where central bankers float new ideas, away from D.C. politics and Wall Street chatter.\nAs Antlers Arch puts it: \u201cThe remote, scenic setting also provides a relaxed atmosphere conducive to open discussion, away from the bustle of urban financial centers.\u201d\nOver the years, the Kansas City Fed has turned Jackson Hole into a tradition as durable as monetary policy itself.\nWhat Were Some Historic Moments?\nJackson Hole has been a stage for major policy shifts. In 2005, IMF economist Raghuram Rajan warned that banks underestimated the risks of exotic derivatives. He famously stated, \u201cThe same way parents are asked, \u2018Do you know where your children are?\u2019, bankers nowadays are asked, \u2018Do you know where your risks are held?'\u201d\nHis peers dismissed him at the time, but the speech foreshadowed the 2008 crash.\nBen Bernanke, Fed Chair from 2006 to 2014, led the first so-called quantitative easing (QE1) effort in 2008 to stabilize markets after the financial crisis. Quantitative easing\u2014where the central bank buys financial assets to inject money into the economy\u2014was used again in QE2 in 2010 and QE3 in 2012 to sustain the recovery, support lending, prevent a deeper recession and combat deflation.\nAfter Bernanke, Janet Yellen assumed the role in 2014. In 2017, she emphasized that the U.S. financial system had become more resilient since the 2008 crisis, having reduced the system's vulnerability to \u201cshocks\u201d without unduly limiting credit or economic growth.\nPowell, since becoming Fed Chair in 2018, has faced a series of major challenges, from late-cycle market volatility and pre-pandemic rate hikes to the COVID-19 crisis and post-pandemic inflation surges. He noted in 2024 that inflation \u201ceased substantially\u201d from 7% to 2.7%, but was \u201cstill too high.\u201d That hasn\u2019t changed under Trump, regardless of the number of firing threats Powell receives. (Legally, a U.S. president cannot fire the Fed chair.)\nWhy Does It Matter So Much?\nBecause Jackson Hole isn't just about theory. It's where central bankers preview the policies that ripple across global markets. A single sentence can send bond yields spiking, stocks tumbling, or currencies swinging. Investors, economists, and politicians hang on every word, reading between the lines for hints of what's next.\nRecall 2022 when Powell discussed the \u201cpain\u201d households and businesses would feel in order to reduce inflation. The S&P 500 fell 12% in the month that followed, according to Reuters. Usually, the month that followed each of Powell\u2019s last seven Jackson Hole speeches, the S&P 500 has fallen nearly 2% on average.\nMeanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield spiked by an average of 21 bps and the dollar has risen 1.4% over the same period.\nWhat's At Stake This Year?\nThis year, the spotlight on Powell is even brighter. Inflation remains sticky, and markets are eager for clarity on potential rate cuts. At the same time, speculation swirls over Fed independence under a MAGA-aligned administration. Private equity and credit markets are particularly eager for cuts, hoping to reignite dealmaking.\nWhether Powell delivers soothing words or maintains caution, the speech will be highly scrutinized. And though he may be a \"lame duck\" Fed chair, Jackson Hole remains his forum \u2014 and he can still ruffle some feathers.\nNow Read:\nImage: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "- Nvidia fell after halting H20 chip work in China as DeepSeek launched a domestic chip-ready AI model.\n- Beijing\u2019s local chip push and DeepSeek\u2019s V3.1 upgrade raised concerns over Nvidia\u2019s China outlook.\n- The market is reacting to Powell\u2019s speech. Learn how to time your next move. Details here \u2192\nNvidia Corp. NVDA shares slipped on Friday after reports surfaced that the company has halted work on its H20 artificial intelligence chip for China, just as domestic rival DeepSeek unveiled a new model optimized for local processors.\nThe developments underscore mounting headwinds for Nvidia in a critical market where Beijing is accelerating efforts to reduce reliance on U.S. technology.\nDeepSeek, one of China\u2019s most closely watched AI startups, launched its upgraded V3.1 model on Thursday. The system is designed to run on domestic chips, reflecting Beijing\u2019s push for technological self-sufficiency.\nAlso Read: Nvidia\u2019s AI Expansion Could Push Revenue To $300 Billion By 2026, Analyst Says\nThe update introduces faster processing capabilities, a new FP8 precision format, and a hybrid inference structure capable of toggling between reasoning and non-reasoning tasks. The company also added a \u201cdeep thinking\u201d feature to its platforms and plans to implement new API pricing beginning September 6.\nThe move comes after DeepSeek encountered performance hurdles with Huawei\u2019s Ascend processors, forcing the startup to rely on Nvidia hardware for earlier models. Its R1 release in January rattled global markets, erasing roughly $600 billion in Nvidia\u2019s market value amid fears of a serious new competitor.\nAt the same time, Nvidia is facing heightened regulatory pressure in China. The company has reportedly instructed suppliers, including Amkor Technology AMKR and Samsung Electronics SSNLF, to suspend work on its China-focused H20 chip.\nThe pause follows meetings between Chinese regulators and tech giants such as Tencent Holdings TCEHY and ByteDance, in which officials urged companies to pivot away from Nvidia hardware in favor of domestic alternatives from Huawei and Cambricon.\nAnalysts caution that the disruption could weigh on Nvidia\u2019s near-term results. KeyBanc Capital Markets estimates that excluding China sales could cut quarterly revenue by $2 billion to $3 billion. However, strong global demand and the company\u2019s rollout of its next-generation Blackwell B200 chips may help offset some of the pressure. China contributed 13% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in fiscal 2024, highlighting the strategic importance of the market.\nDespite the latest setback, Nvidia stock has gained more than 30% this year, cementing its dominance in the graphics processing unit segment as Big Tech players including Microsoft MSFT and Meta Platforms META pour billions into AI infrastructure.\nPrice Action: NVDA stock is trading lower by 1.14% to $172.98 premarket at last check Friday.\nRead Next:\nImage via Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Powell, whom Trump originally appointed as Fed Chair in 2018, earned the \u201cToo Late\u201d label referencing his delayed rate cut timing, while Cook received a prominent red \u201cX\u201d marked \u201cThe Fraudster.\u201d\nThe graphic positions Trump appointees Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and nominee Stephen Miran as administration allies. This comes as markets price in September rate cuts following Powell\u2019s dovish Jackson Hole speech that sparked broad rallies across equities and cryptocurrencies.\nCook Mortgage Controversy Intensifies DOJ Review\nCook faces mortgage fraud allegations from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte, who claims she improperly designated properties as primary residences for favorable loan terms in 2021.\n\u201cI\u2019ll fire her if she doesn\u2019t resign,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday. Cook previously stated she has \u201cno intention of being bullied to step down.\u201d\nWaller Emerges as Powell Replacement Frontrunner\nPrediction markets show Waller leading Fed Chair succession odds at 51% on Kalshi, ahead of Kevin Hassett (30%) and Kevin Warsh (24%).\nWaller dissented at July\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, advocating immediate 25-basis-point cuts while Powell held rates steady. His proactive stance aligns with Trump\u2019s preference for a forward-looking monetary policy.\n\u201cWhen labor markets turn, they often turn fast,\u201d Waller stated, warning against falling behind the curve with GDP growth at just 1.2% in 2025\u2019s first half.\nMarket Implications for Rate-Sensitive Sectors\nPowell\u2019s Jackson Hole pivot triggered significant moves across asset classes. The Dow Jones jumped 2% to new highs above 45,680, while the S&P 500 climbed 1.4% and the Russell 2000 soared nearly 4%.\nBitcoin BTC/USD gained 3.5%, with Ethereum ETH/USD, Solana SOL/USD and Cardano ADA/USD posting double-digit gains as crypto markets entered \u201crisk-on\u201d mode.\nRate-sensitive sectors, including homebuilders, small caps, and regional banks, rallied sharply on accommodation expectations.
