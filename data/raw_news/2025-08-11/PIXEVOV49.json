Why Trust Us?\n\nA camping tent can be a big investment, and an ultralight backpacking model even more so. I\u2019ve had plenty of friends put their tent away without fully drying or cleaning them, then pulled the tent out the next season reeking of mildew with zippers that barely stayed in their tracks.\n\nWhile the best tents are built with durable materials and should hold up for many seasons, proper storage and cleaning can make this critical part of your camping setup last even longer.\n\nI should say that you don\u2019t have to deep clean your tent after every time you use it. In fact, I approach this task with the same loose frequency of my truck\u2019s oil change. I give my tent a good cleaning after an extended backpacking trip or thru-hike, or at the end of the season before I put it in storage.\n\nThis can be a tempting chore to skip after a long trip or at the end of the season, but I recommend taking the time to do it. Cleaning your tent shouldn\u2019t take longer than 45 minutes if it\u2019s moderately dirty, maybe a little longer if you need to seriously spot clean or do a mildew soak. Accumulated dirt and grime can wear down the waterproofing and durable water repellent (DWR) treatment on your tent body and fly, abrade the fragile mesh, and wear holes in the material creases. Additionally, letting sand and grit sit between pole segments can weaken the shock cords and make it hard for the poles to slip into place. Finally, the zippers can accumulate salt, sand, and dust, causing them to jump the tracks or get stuck.\n\nEven if you aren\u2019t doing a full cleaning, I recommend shaking all the loose dirt and grime out of the tent and fly and making sure it\u2019s fully dry before folding it carefully and storing it in its bag.\n\u2022 Non-abrasive brush: Shoe Cleaning Brush Set\n\nYou\u2019ll use these to spot clean any really grimy areas, and make sure you choose the softest option. I have a small brush that came with a Nikwax shoe refreshing kit, but any soft brush or sponge will do.\n\u2022 Mild dish soap: Unscented Palmolive\n\nUnscented is best because it has fewer chemicals that could be too harsh on the tent\u2019s material. This is what you\u2019ll use to spot clean.\n\u2022 Soft cloth or sponge: Magic Fiber Cleaning Cloth\n\nYou can use this microfiber rag (wet or dry) to wipe down grody tent poles and stakes and spot-clean dirtier areas on your tent.\n\u2022 Toothbrush: Gum Classic Soft Toothbrush\n\nI use this for cleaning zippers, zipper pulls, and clasps. You can do this after the soak for getting into the dirtiest parts of a stuck zipper.\n\u2022 Tech wash: NikWax Tech Wash\n\nI currently have an Arc\u2019teryx tech wash for my tent-soaking detergent, but the NikWax I linked to is easier to find. Both of these help refresh the technical properties (like water resistance) and are easier on the fabric than laundry detergent. I use this for my Gore-Tex apparel and other waterproof clothes, and always dilute it a little more when I soak my tent.\n\u2022 Large tub: 10-Gallon Tub\n\nYou don\u2019t need anything fancy here\u2014just something big enough for soaking and rinsing. You can use your bathtub, laundry sink, or large bin. I use an old (totally cleaned) garbage can.\n\u2022 Optional waterproofing refresh: Nikwax Tent and Gear SolarProof Waterproofing Spray\n\nI don\u2019t do this every time I wash my tents, but I love this treatment for older tents with less reliable waterproofing. It won\u2019t make them as good as new, but I do notice a difference in how well it repels water after using it. You can also use the Nikwax linked above to spot treat worn-out areas with a waterproofing booster for waterproof materials.\n\nTo get your tent ready for washing, unzip the doors and turn the tent inside out, shaking out any loose dirt and debris.\n\nSpot clean with the dish soap, focusing on problem areas with sap, muddy patches, or gross dog pawprints. Here, I use the cloth or soft brush and a small amount of mild dish soap, getting just these areas wet.\n\nThis isn\u2019t totally necessary, but a stuck zipper can be a big pain in the butt in the backcountry, so better safe than sorry. If your tent hasn\u2019t been cleaned in a while or you\u2019ve been somewhere with blowing sand, dirty surfaces, or salty air, I recommend taking a toothbrush and swiping up and down on the zipper, latches, and closures. Any aggressive dirt can be attacked again after soaking and rinsing.\n\nI fill the tub about \u2153 of the way with lukewarm water, then top it off up to 2\u20443 with my hose\u2014just make sure the water is not super hot. Filling the tub 2\u20443 full leaves the extra space for the tent. Then add the tent cleaning product at the dilution instructed on the bottle. I recommend at least a 10-gallon tub to make sure you have space to move the tent around and not let detergent build up.\n\n5) Take your tent for a swim.\n\nDrop that tent and fly into the tub and make sure they\u2019re fully immersed. Check the cleaner bottle to see how long to soak the tent for, and swirl it around a few times to make sure you\u2019re hitting all the spots.\n\nAfter soaking in the detergent, drain your tub and fill it with fresh water. Swirl it around, try to hit all the soapy areas. I usually do this two or three times to make sure the soap is fully gone. If you don\u2019t get all detergent cleaned off, it can reduce the effectiveness of the waterproofing.\n\nI like to do this while my tent is in the soak or the rinse. Just take the soft cloth and wipe off any dirt or grime, making extra sure to get into the nesting sections where the aluminum or carbon compound can get abraded by embedded grit.\n\nYou can either set your tent up for maximum surface area air exposure or hang it off a railing. I recommend drying it in a shady outdoor spot with plenty of airflow\u2014a porch railing is perfect. A garage works in a pinch, but it\u2019ll take longer to dry. Do not store your tent wet, or the next time you pull it out, it will be covered with mildew and this whole endeavor will be for naught.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this after every trip: Like I said above, most people will be just fine shaking their tent out, wiping off any egregiously dirty parts, and storing it fully dry. You only need to fully clean it once each season or after a very long backpacking trip or thru-hike.\n\nAvoid harsh chemicals: It can be tempting to use harsh detergent or chemical-laden cleaning supplies on your tent, but outdoor brands make tech wash for a reason. Many backpacking tents are made with high-tech, low-denier, fragile materials that won\u2019t hold up to the chemicals in industrial cleaners. You\u2019re better off shelling out $15-30 for a special cleaner than wearing a hole in your tent or ruining the waterproofing treatment with the wrong cleaner.\n\nDo NOT put your tent in the washing machine: I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to say this, but just in case. Washing machine cycles are far too harsh for the mesh and tent fly, plus any top-loading machine will decimate a tent with the central agitator.\n\nTents with mildew will require extra care: We all make mistakes and stash a damp tent without meaning to. If you pull your tent out and are confronted with a rank, mildew odor, all is not lost. Here I\u2019d use an enzyme cleaner, paying attention to how long you soak it for from the bottle instructions. If you leave it in there too long you can damage the waterproof properties of the tent body and fly.",

      "text": "Camping is one of the most accessible ways to spend a night under the stars, but whether you\u2019re at a drive-up site with your family or on a solo mission in the backcountry, tent camping is more than just showing up and pitching. Knowing how to set up a tent is important, but so are the basics of choosing a campsite, understanding different models, and best practices for minimizing impact.\nIn my 15 years backpacking and camping, I\u2019ve shown up to campsites without tent stakes, attempted to pitch a new tent after dark in a thunderstorm, and woken up to flooded grounds. Trial and error might be part of the learning process, but my goal here is to save you from a few headaches.\nHow to Pick the Right Tent\nTents come in a wide range of styles, interior space, prices, weights, features, and intended uses. Here are the primary categories, and who they might be best for.\nCamping Tents\nA camping tent is usually a freestanding model complete with poles, stakes, body, and fly. These tents pitch quickly with the included pole system, and don\u2019t necessarily need to be staked in order to maintain shape. Camping tents have a huge range of capacity, weight, and price, and are good for everything from car camping to backpacking. Car campers should look for more robust, heavier models, while backpackers should stick to four pounds or less for a two-person model.\nUltralight Tents\nUltralight tents are best for experienced backpackers looking to shed pack weight. These are often made with thinner materials, and can be freestanding or trekking-pole supported depending on the model. Some lightweight tents are still double-walled with a separate body and fly, but many are single-walled, which means the body and fly are integrated. This drops weight but comes with condensation compromise. This category is best for campers with more experience, as the materials are more fragile and can be trickier to pitch.\nOne-Person Tents\nOne-person tents are defined by their solo-camper capacity. Similar to camping tents, one-person tents range from heavier freestanding models to ultralight single-walled shelters. These are great for solo backpackers looking to save weight, but can feel confined if you need to bring gear into the tent. If you choose this route, look for at least 18 feet of interior space and a generous vestibule to stash gear.\nFamily Tents\nThese are the beefcakes of the tent camping world, and usually have at least a four-person capacity, though I\u2019ve seen space for up to eight. Family tents are a great option for larger groups in the frontcountry, and can have more than 60 feet of interior space and full standing room. These are quite heavy (20 pounds or more) and take up more footprint space, so be sure you have a site large enough to accommodate the tent and vestibules. If you\u2019re unsure of your group numbers, I recommend sizing up to ensure plenty of livable space.\nHow to Find the Right Campsite\nWhether you\u2019re in the frontcountry or backcountry, you\u2019ll need to choose the right campsite for your needs. Treat it well when you\u2019re there, and leave it better than you found it.\nFind an established campsite or durable surface. This ensures frontcountry and backcountry spaces stay as unimpacted as possible. In the frontcountry, only set up a tent at established sites. These use durable surfaces like dirt or gravel and keep everyone at the campsite well spaced.\nEstablished campsites also exist in the backcountry, and should be your first choice for a spot. These are usually on pine needles or bare ground and don\u2019t hurt live growth. If your route doesn\u2019t have established campsites, first make sure camping is legal, then look for a dispersed site under trees, on rocks, or on pine needles. Never set a tent up on flowers or fragile undergrowth, and make sure to minimize your impact by following the Leave No Trace principles when you leave in the morning.\nLook for flat ground. Take a walk around and find the most level section to pitch a tent. Clear out any big sticks or rocks, then lie down on the ground to see if it actually feels flat. Chances are there\u2019s a slight angle, so make sure to set up your tent with your head facing uphill.\nMake sure there\u2019s enough space and depth for staking. You\u2019ll need enough room for the base of the tent as well as staking space for the vestibule and guylines. This can add several feet in either direction, so account for that when choosing a spot. Also consider the location and direction of the tent's doors. I\u2019ve pitched plenty of tents and wound up with my door opening directly into a bush. You should be able to get the stakes 90 percent of the way into the dirt without rocks right under the surface. If not, you can always anchor stakes with large rocks.\nCheck overhead. I love camping under trees, but I always make sure I\u2019m not under deadfall or broken branches that can come crashing down at night. The hazards here are self-explanatory.\nPrioritize windbreaks. You can\u2019t always predict overnight weather, but if conditions are windy or exposed, I try to set up my tent against the side of a hill, a rocky outcropping, or some other kind of shelter to create a windbreak.\nDon\u2019t pitch a tent in a low spot. A few years ago, I set up camp in an established campsite in what ended up being a downhill depression. I woke up at 2 a.m. to an intense rainstorm, with my tent floating in three inches of water and my shoes floating 30 yards away. Now I always make sure I\u2019m uphill from any water catchments and not blithely staking my tent in a shallow bowl of dirt.\nHow to Set Up a Tent (in Eight Steps)\nIt\u2019s helpful to practice setup in your yard or even inside your house before you get to camp. That way, even if you have to pitch your tent tent in the dark, rain, on a sloped campsite, you have the basics down. These are the detailed instructions for a freestanding camping tent.\n- Double-check the campsite. I've already covered how to choose a campsite, but this is your final(ish) chance to make sure it\u2019s a good spot. Look for wind protection if possible, a flat and clear space on a durable surface, enough space for the vestibule and guylines, and depth for solid stake placement.\n- Lay out all the pieces. For a freestanding tent, this includes the tent body, fly, poles, and stakes. In windy situations, this might also include guylines. You should have checked to make sure you have all the pieces before leaving, so use this space to get organized.\n- Snap your pole segments together. Freestanding tents have aluminum or composite poles that come in segments held together with elastic shock cords. These should be fairly straightforward and snap together easily. Once you have these together, set them aside.\n- Lay out the tent body in the direction you want to sleep in. Many two-person tents have narrower foot areas than head areas, so make sure the head is angled slightly uphill if your site isn\u2019t entirely flat. Double check that there aren\u2019t any stray rocks or roots right underneath the tent.\n- Attach your poles to the corners of your tent. Freestanding tents typically have color-coded pole ends that fit into the hubs at the tent corners. Slot each end of the poles into the corner attachments, then attach the hooks on the tent body to create the tent structure.\n- Stake your tent. Once you have your location finalized, drive your stakes into the ground at a slight outward angle through the cord loops at the corners of the tent. Make sure this is taut\u2014a saggy tent body reduces interior space and can droop even more when wet.\n- Toss the fly on top. Arrange the tent fly with the door lined up with the tent doors, then straighten it so the seams align with the sides and top. Secure the corners of the fly to the corners of the staked tent, usually with color-coded buckles or slotted ports. Pull the lines at the edge of the fly to get the correct tension, then stake out your vestibules in the same way you staked the tent body.\n- Anything extra. Some tents have ventilation options at the top for more airflow, so you can take the time now to prop those open with the included stands. If you\u2019re planning to guy out your tent for added stability in wind, now is the time.\nPitching Other Types of Tents\nI talked about a standard two-person freestanding tent above, but there are a few other types of tents to consider.\nFamily Tent\nThese giant tents pitch similarly to smaller pole-supported tents, but often take longer to secure. Some tents in this category have sleeves to pass the poles through instead of hooks along the tent, which adds stability but are slightly more finicky. Family tent pole systems are more complex, so I recommend practicing before you get to camp, or bringing the directions with you. Be sure to stake large tents as securely as possible, as they are big enough to be more impacted by wind.\nThe REI Base Camp 6 is an absolute behemoth, but if you\u2019re looking for standing room, two giant doors, and plenty of interior pockets, it\u2019s a great option. It pitches faster than you think, and has enough staking and guyline options to stay stable in windy weather.\nOne-Person Tent\nThis is the same as pitching a two-person tent, you\u2019ll just be on your own. If I don\u2019t have anyone helping me pitch my one-person tent, I make sure all pole segments are in place and securely hooked into the tent body hubs before moving on. Otherwise it feels like a circus trying to wrestle the pole sections into place.\nI\u2019ve backpacked with the Big Agnes Tiger Wall for years, and it continues to be my top solo pick. This tent is fast to pitch, saves weight with a semi-freestanding design, and clocks in at just over two pounds, which is pretty good for the 19 feet of interior space.\nTrekking-Pole Tent\nI used Gossamer Gear\u2019s The One on a 500-mile Colorado Trail thru-hike, and it\u2019s still my favorite trekking-pole tent. It feels palatial for a solo tent, and has a tall bathtub floor to prevent splashing rain. This tent also comes in a two-person model with the same pitch and design.\nMaggie Slepian is a full-time freelance writer in the outdoor industry and has tested gear professionally for almost ten years\u2014she is an avid backpacker, trail runner, bikepacker, and horseback rider and has thru-hiked thousands of miles on the Appalachian, Colorado, and Ouachita trails, along with backcountry travel on terrain including coastal trails, the desert, and high alpine peaks.

Nikwax products are all environmentally friendly; they are water-based, PFAS-free and have never used any harmful aerosols.\nWhy breathability depends upon water repellency\u2026 Breathable waterproof footwear is most likely to get sweaty and wet inside when used in damp or wet conditions. If the outer leather absorbs water, the breathability of the footwear will be reduced. Therefore, the Durable Water Repellency (DWR) of your footwear must be maintained to ensure comfort. Through use, the outer surface of footwear will pick up contaminants, such as dirt, which attract water, masking the effect of any DWR coating. Nikwax Footwear Cleaning Gel\u2122 will remove contaminants and revitalize DWR. Durable Water Repellency will eventually wear off and need to be renewed Nikwax Fabric & Leather Proof\u2122.

If the outer leather absorbs water, the breathability of the footwear will be reduced. Therefore, the Durable Water Repellency (DWR) of your footwear must be maintained to ensure comfort. Through use, the outer surface of footwear will pick up contaminants, such as dirt, which attract water, masking the effect of any DWR coating.\nNikwax Footwear Cleaning Gel\u2122 will remove contaminants and revitalize DWR. Durable Water Repellency will eventually wear off and need to be renewed Nikwax Fabric & Leather Proof\u2122.\nBreathable waterproof footwear is for active, outdoor people\u2026\nAnyone who is active outside in damp or wet conditions will benefit from breathable waterproof footwear. Whether you\u2019re a mountaineer, cyclist, dog walker, or you work outside, you will need good footwear."

      "text": "When you think of backpacking or camping tents, you probably think of pole-supported designs. Rightfully so, since the majority of thru-hikers, backpackers, and campers recommend this style, myself included. But inflatable tents do exist, and people buy them. Would I recommend them? Not in most cases.\nThrough my own experience on thousands of miles of thru-hiking trails, plus in conversation with professional gear tester and avid backcountry traveler Sam Schild, the reasons become more apparent.\nInflatable tents are heavy, not as stable in wind, and require a pump to inflate. While fairly simple to pitch, inflatable tents don\u2019t have the same structural integrity as a pole tent, which can be frustrating in good conditions, and dangerous in bad conditions. Plus, they\u2019re a lot bulkier to transport.\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced, here\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t suggest inflatable tents for your next adventure. I've also included a few options for pole tents I highly recommend.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a pole tent and an inflatable tent?\nWhile the general idea is the same\u2014a portable shelter for staying outdoors overnight\u2014the main difference between a pole tent and an inflatable tent is the support structure. A pole tent uses a system of rigid poles to provide the skeleton for the tent body and fly, while an inflatable tent uses air beams for the structure, with the rigidity in the same place as poles in a standard tent.\nOften made from lightweight, flexible aluminum or composites, tent poles are made to withstand wind, freezing temperatures, and extended exposure to the elements while maintaining a stable support system for the shelter. They usually incorporate shock cords connecting segments for easy snap-together construction.\n\u201cMy ideal pole structure is a single-hub design, with just one crossbeam,\u201d says Schild. Schild told me that he looks for a simple setup that snaps together quickly and provides a wide support base under a taut pitch. My preferences are similar, though I don\u2019t mind using an extra horizontal pole segment for more shoulder room, like in my favorite Big Agnes model.\nPole tents are also often smaller and more portable, with a better variety of options available than inflatable tents. Both Schild and I have used a range of pole-supported models, including ultralight backpacking tents, four-season options, and heavier car-camping tents.\nMeanwhile, the air beams in inflatable tents are highly pressurized to create structure. This means you can set it up pretty quickly once it\u2019s laid out on the ground and attached to a pump. Inflatable tents are also often taller for standing room, since you aren\u2019t relying on the length of rigid poles for the structure.\nWhen used, inflatable tents are best for car camping, base camping, or larger family outings where weight matters less. But, trust me when I say that no one is packing a pump into the backcountry.\nInflatable tents don\u2019t have the same structural integrity as pole tents.\nI\u2019ve camped in a lot of storms and high winds, and relying on a tent for protection doesn\u2019t just mean a more comfortable night outdoors, it can mean the difference between staying safe and getting into serious trouble.\n\u201cMy backpacking shelters have saved my bacon more times than I can count,\u201d agrees Schild. \u201cEspecially at a high elevation with a lot of exposure and no protection from incoming storms.\u201d\nInflatable tents don\u2019t have the same wind resistance as a domed pole tent, many of which are made to withstand high winds and snow loading. In fact, large inflatable tents can act like a sail, catching wind and losing their structure in cross-loaded wind events. Inflatable tents are also prone to punctures and leaks, which make them unusable without a patch kit, and unreliable even with a patch.\nWhichever model you use, make sure you stake it correctly and guy out the extra lines for optimal tension, stability, and wind resistance.\nSome people find inflatable tents faster to pitch than pole tents.\nAn inflatable tent can be somewhat faster to set up than a pole tent, especially for people without a lot of camping experience. Simply lay the tent material on the ground, attach the pump, and watch the structure appear. However, with practice, most people can usually pitch their pole tent in less than a minute.\nAs far as pitching a pole tent goes, while hub systems for larger models can be intimidating, most don\u2019t make you thread the poles through material sleeves anymore. Instead, they rely on a simple series of clips attached to the tent material.\nThis makes setup quick, and once you understand your system, the poles snap together fast and the tent body and fly are intuitive to pitch. No matter which style you choose, you\u2019ll need to stake the tent to the ground at the corners. Setup is similar in that way, and this part takes about the same amount of time.\nIs there ever a time to use an inflatable tent?\nWhile I\u2019m not a complete advocate for inflatable tents, they do easily stand as tall as a family-sized car-camping tent, and you won\u2019t have to deal with separate poles for structure. Some people might also prefer the use of air beams, and dealing with less overall components.\nIf you do want to try an inflatable tent, I\u2019d recommend them mostly for people who don\u2019t get out often, and are looking for a largely hands-free way to pitch their tent without keeping track of a complex pole system. Since these tents don\u2019t pack down as small, they\u2019re best for people with more storage space and transport room.\nAgain, inflatable tents aren\u2019t my top choice for stability, durability, and packed size, and I\u2019d recommend pole tents 99 percent of the time. Whichever you choose though, make sure you practice pitching before you leave home, and always double check to make sure you have all the required components with you.\nThree Poles Tents I Recommend\nMaggie Slepian is a full-time freelance writer in the outdoor industry and has tested gear professionally for almost ten years\u2014she is an avid backpacker, trail runner, bikepacker, and horseback rider and has thru-hiked thousands of miles on the Appalachian, Colorado, and Ouachita trails, along with backcountry travel on terrain including coastal trails, the desert, and high alpine peaks.

We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?\nEditor's Note, August 1, 2025: Ahead of our next update, we're in the process of testing additional family tents from brands including Coleman and The North Face. We're about halfway through that testing, so below, you'll see a preliminary review of our new picks, plus updated information on the models we've tested in the past. Some of our favorites are on sale at the time of this writing, including 49% off the Eureka! Copper Canyon LX, our Best for Gear Storage.\nWhether you\u2019re heading out on a weekend camping trip or taking a cross-country road trip with the family, having the right tent is a must. The quickest way to ruin what might otherwise be prime family time is sleeping in cramped quarters or having a rainfly that fails.\nA good tent should be easy to set up, spacious enough for everyone\u2014and their camping gear\u2014and durable enough to handle unpredictable weather. Nice-to-have extras include things like covered storage space and front and rear vestibules. And, with today\u2019s tents offering, everything from blackout bedrooms to built-in LED lighting and near-instant setup, there\u2019s never been a better time to upgrade.\nWe looked at dozens of tents\u2014from classic cabin styles to compact car-camping options\u2014and narrowed it down to the very best. Our picks below are designed to keep everyone comfortable and (mostly) sane under one roof.\nThe Best Family Tents\n- Best Overall: REI Co-Op Base Camp 6\n- Best Value: Coleman Sundome 4\n- Most Doors: Snow Peak Alpha Breeze Tent\n- Best for Large Families: Ozark Trail 8-Person Instant Cabin Tent\n- Best for Gear Storage: Eureka Copper Canyon LX 4\nHow We Tested and Selected\nWe've done hands-on testing with several tents of all sizes, and all of the tents listed below have the seal of approval from our experienced campers here at Popular Mechanics. We kept our search to three-season tents designed primarily for car camping that fit four people or more, since these are the most commonly purchased tents on the market. Then, we considered space, weather resistance, ease of setup, and smart features for families in more than 20 models.\nWe are in the process of testing even more tents, like the Wawona 6 tent from The North Face and the Coleman Tenaya Lake Fast Pitch. Our preview reviews of those two products are at the end of this list. Check back in the coming weeks to see full reviews of these tents, but for now, here are our favorite family tents that warrant your consideration.\nSarah Connor is a Reviews Editor for Popular Mechanics.

We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?\nChoosing the right lightweight tent can be the difference between a comfortable base weight and an uncomfortably heavy pack. A lightweight tent should weigh no more than 3.5 lbs. for a two-person tent, and ideally no more than 2 lbs for a one-person tent. Look for a user-friendly pitch system (whether you\u2019re using a trekking-pole shelter or a freestanding double-wall tent) and enough head and shoulder room to comfortably sit up and change.\nConsider condensation, how much space the tent takes up at a site, and whether you want two doors for your two-person shelter. With those credentials in mind, here are our picks for the best lightweight tents on the market.\nBest Ultralight Tents\nThe Expert: I have backpacked thousands of miles and spent many months sleeping in tents. I have thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail, Colorado Trail, and Ouachita Trail, and I\u2019m currently checking off sections of the Oregon Coast Trail and the Arizona Trail.\nI\u2019m also set to embark on a 2,700-mile bike tour this summer. All of these miles (and months) sleeping outdoors means I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in tents\u2014both overnight and during the day waiting out storms\u2014and I have plenty of tried-and-true options to pick from.\nHow to Choose an Ultralight Tent\nThere are plenty of ultralight tent options on the market, but you can narrow down the options by choosing your preferred tent capacity, style, and considering the livable space and vestibule area.\nWhat capacity tent do you need?\nLightweight tents typically come in one, two, or three-person capacities. If you\u2019re buying one tent to do it all, we recommend a two-person tent. Many models are light enough to carry as a solo hiker, but it gives you the option of camping comfortably with a partner should the opportunity arise. Plus, a two-person tent allows space to spread your gear inside the tent and not feel cramped against the walls.\nDo you prefer a trekking-pole style or freestanding?\nMany hikers start out with a freestanding (or semi-freestanding) tent for easier pitch and more flexibility with site choice\u2014it\u2019s easier to pitch a freestanding tent on sandy or rocky ground. However, trekking pole shelters are often lighter, and once you get the hang of the pitch, they are also quick to set up, though many of these single-wall shelters collect more condensation.\nIf you are looking to shed ounces, go for a trekking-pole shelter. If you want a double-wall shelter with an easier pitch and don\u2019t mind a bit more weight, go for a freestanding tent.\nHow much livable space does the tent have?\nFor two-person tents, we look for at least 27 square feet of interior space, and most people prefer two doors and two vestibules. For one-person shelters, look for at least 16 square feet of interior space and a 7-foot vestibule. A peak height of at least 38-40 inches will feel comfortable for most hikers.\nHow We Selected\nThese tents are all top-of-the-line lightweight shelters from legacy brands with a dedicated history of building gear for weight-conscious hikers and backpackers. These shelters are all lightweight, durable, and packed with features like large vestibules, single-hub poles, easy pitching, and internal storage to make them streamlined and comfortable for nights on the trail or at a campsite.\nI have tested most of these myself, and the ones I haven\u2019t owned or tested are vetted by my outdoor-industry colleagues and the thru-hiker community. I looked for a range of styles\u2014from entirely freestanding to trekking-pole supported\u2014as well as one-person and two-person models that hit the sweet spot between weight, durability, and livable space.\nWe did consider the backpacker favorite Big Agnes Fly Creek UL, which is a great tent, but the front-facing door (and single door for the two-person) ultimately didn\u2019t make the cut in favor of the brand\u2019s Tiger Wall and Copper Spur.\nWe also considered REI\u2019s trekking-pole shelter, the Flash Air I, but the price has gone up, and at 2.5 pounds for a one-person trekking-pole shelter, it didn\u2019t have the specs we needed for price, space, and weight.\nMaggie Slepian is a full-time freelance writer in the outdoor industry and has tested gear professionally for almost ten years\u2014she is an avid backpacker, trail runner, bikepacker, and horseback rider and has thru-hiked thousands of miles on the Appalachian, Colorado, and Ouachita trails, along with backcountry travel on terrain including coastal trails, the desert, and high alpine peaks.
