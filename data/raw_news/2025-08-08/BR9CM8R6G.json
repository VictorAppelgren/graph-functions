  "description": "A Bay Area man is accused of using aliases and \"fake books\" to steal valuable manuscripts from UCLA.",
  "content": "A couple look out at Royce Hall on the UCLA campus in Westwood.\n\nA Bay Area man has been charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts valued at $216,000 from the UCLA library in an alleged scheme involving fake aliases and replacement books.\n\nJeffrey Ying of Fremont allegedly used three fake names to check out the valuable antique manuscripts from UCLA in a possible five-year string of robberies, with some of the stolen books dating back to the 13th century, according to investigators.\n\nYing, arrested Wednesday before an alleged attempt to flee to China, was charged by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office with theft of major artwork, a felony punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison, and is expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles in the coming days, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles said Thursday.\n\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, 38-year-old Ying rented manuscripts in groups, abusing a recently new system at UCLA that allowed users to request library cards and rent books without showing an official ID. He would then return \u201cdummy books\u201d in place of the actual manuscripts.\n\nThe \u201cdummy books\u201d were often blank or low-value manuscripts with computer-paper-printed labels and asset tags to mimic those of the actual books.\n\nSince 2020, Ying allegedly requested books from the Southern Regional Library Facility (SRL), a remote UCLA library storage space meant to house rare or delicate books. In response to his request, a box containing manuscripts would be transported to a reserved reading room at the Charles E. Young Research Library of UCLA. Ying would review and replace the manuscripts with his \u201cdummies,\u201d taking the originals with him as he left, according to an FBI affidavit.\n\nLibrary staff told The Times that the official policy is to have an attendant present in the reading room at all times as someone reads special collections books.\n\nWhen the material was returned to the library, the university had no policy requiring a thorough review of the items to ensure they were not replaced with dummy manuscripts, according to officials.\n\nThe director of UCLA Library Special Collections received notice from the head of the university\u2019s East Asian Library that three rare Chinese books were missing after being last checked out by someone named \u201cAlan Fujimori.\u201d\n\nAccording to the FBI affidavit, security camera analysis from library staff revealed that Fujimori, Austin Chen, and Jason Wang, who had all checked out valuable manuscripts over the years, were all aliases for one person\u2014 Ying.\n\nThrough a travel record investigation, FBI officials said they discovered that Ying traveled back and forth from China within several days of the alleged robberies, presumably to sell or transport the books.\n\nHowever, as of yet, the FBI said it has not confirmed whether Ying sold or traded any of the manuscripts. The FBI affidavit also lists every book stolen by Ying as \u201cnever returned,\u201d which may mean that authorities have not found them.\n\nWhile the official number of stolen books is unconfirmed, affidavit testimony suggests at least 10 are missing, each valued between $274 to $70,000.\n\nOver the course of October to December of last year, federal investigation detailed in the FBI affidavit found that Ying checked out six books under the alias \u201cJason Wang.\u201d On Aug. 5 of this year, Ying requested eight more books as \u201cAustin Chen.\u201d The next day, Ying planned to board a previously booked flight to China. UCLA police were already tipped off of suspicious behavior \u2014 by the time Ying arrived to pick up his eight books before his flight, authorities were called and promptly arrested him.\n\nWhile the arrest and affidavit records primarily focused on the robberies of the past year, they also allege that in 2020, Ying, under the name Alan Fujimori, stole two UCLA manuscripts from the 13th and 16th centuries valued at a combined $132,386.\n\nHis record could go back even further. The FBI affidavit mentions that the alias \u2018Alan Fujimori\u2019 is associated with a known book thief who was on the run after similar thefts at the UC Berkeley library.\n\nAt his arrest, Ying was found with a card for Hotel Angeleno, located three miles away from the UCLA library, according to FBI and UCLA police\u2019s investigation detailed in the affidavit. The document also detailed that later in the day of the arrest, officers and detectives searched Ying\u2019s room at Hotel Angelino with a search warrant. They discovered blank manuscripts, printed tags, and fraudulent IDs that matched past aliases.\n\nYing is not yet matched with an attorney and remains in custody for risk of leaving the country.",

      "text": "Ex-USC official to plead guilty in admissions fraud case\n- Share via\nA former USC admissions official accused of accepting thousands of dollars in payments to ensure graduate-school admission for unqualified international students is expected to plead guilty Monday to a federal fraud charge.\nHiu Kit David Chong admitted in his April plea agreement that he falsified applicants\u2019 admission packets with doctored college transcripts, phony letters of recommendation and fraudulent personal statements.\nChong, a 36-year-old Arcadia resident, agreed to plead guilty by video conference to a single wire fraud count, a felony carrying a sentence of up to 20 years behind bars. Chong, who was assistant director of USC\u2019s Office of Graduate Admissions from September 2008 to March 2016, told Chinese nationals he could assist them in obtaining admission into a graduate degree program at the university, according to his plea agreement. He furthered the scheme by operating a now-defunct Monterey Park academic consulting company, prosecutors said.\nFrom February 2015 to December 2018, Chong solicited and received payments \u2014 ranging from $8,000 to $12,000 \u2014 from unqualified international students or from others who were acting on behalf of the unqualified students.\nThe defendant purchased phony college transcripts purporting to be from Chinese universities and instructed his supplier to create transcripts to show falsely inflated grade point averages, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\nChong admitted he submitted the phony documents in the students\u2019 USC application packets, including fraudulent letters of recommendation and fabricated personal statements purportedly written by the applicants, prosecutors said.\nHe also offered to research how to arrange for a surrogate test taker to take the English as a Foreign Language exam, the results of which USC would consider when making decisions regarding admissions applications, according to court documents. In his plea agreement, Chong admitted concealing from the university that the applicants paid him to facilitate their admission.\nChong also admitted to helping three unqualified international students gain admission to USC using phony application materials. Chong said he was paid $38,000 from international students and people he believed were working with international students, including an undercover law enforcement official. He also received additional payments from other international students as part of the scheme, resulting in profits of $40,000, federal prosecutors said.\nUSC issued a statement in April saying the university cooperated with the federal investigation.\nChong concealed these actions from the university and continued engaging in them for two and a half years after he left USC, according to the university."

County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman announced Monday. They both pleaded not guilty.\nThe pair are accused of running a payroll fraud scheme in 2022 when Almanza was working as a field supervisor in the athletics department and Maxwell had left a position as grounds worker.

      "text": "Hungary\u2019s oldest library is fighting to save 100,000 books from a beetle infestation\n- Share via\nPANNONHALMA, Hungary \u2014 Tens of thousands of centuries-old books are being pulled from the shelves of a medieval abbey in Hungary in an effort to save them from a beetle infestation that could wipe out centuries of history.\nThe 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey is a sprawling Benedictine monastery that is one of Hungary\u2019s oldest centers of learning and a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nRestoration workers are removing about 100,000 hand-bound books from their shelves and carefully placing them in crates, the start of a disinfection process that aims to kill the tiny beetles burrowed into them.\nThe drugstore beetle, also known as the bread beetle, is often found among dried foodstuffs like grains, flour and spices. But they also are attracted to the gelatin and starch-based adhesives found in books.\nThey have been found in a section of the library housing around a quarter of the abbey\u2019s 400,000 volumes.\n\u201cThis is an advanced insect infestation which has been detected in several parts of the library, so the entire collection is classified as infected and must be treated all at the same time,\u201d said Zs\u00f3fia Edit Hajdu, the chief restorer on the project. \u201cWe\u2019ve never encountered such a degree of infection before.\u201d\nAbbey houses historical treasures\nThe beetle invasion was first detected during a routine library cleaning. Employees noticed unusual layers of dust on the shelves and then saw that holes had been burrowed into some of the book spines. Upon opening the volumes, burrow holes could be seen in the paper where the beetles chewed through.\nThe abbey at Pannonhalma was founded in 996, four years before the establishment of the Kingdom of Hungary. Sitting upon a tall hill in northwestern Hungary, the abbey houses the country\u2019s oldest collection of books, as well as many of its earliest and most important written records.\nFor over 1,000 years, the abbey has been among the most prominent religious and cultural sites in Hungary and all of Central Europe, surviving centuries of wars and foreign incursions such as the Ottoman invasion and occupation of Hungary in the 16th century.\nIlona \u00c1sv\u00e1nyi, director of the Pannonhalma Archabbey library, said she is \u201chumbled\u201d by the historical and cultural treasures the collection holds whenever she enters.\n\u201cIt is dizzying to think that there was a library here a thousand years ago, and that we are the keepers of the first book catalogue in Hungary,\u201d she said.\nAmong the library\u2019s most outstanding works are 19 codices, including a complete Bible from the 13th century. It also houses several hundred manuscripts predating the invention of the printing press in the mid-15th century and tens of thousands of books from the 16th century.\nWhile the oldest and rarest prints and books are stored separately and have not been infected, \u00c1sv\u00e1nyi said any damage to the collection represents a blow to cultural, historical and religious heritage.\n\u201cWhen I see a book chewed up by a beetle or infected in any other way, I feel that no matter how many copies are published and how replaceable the book is, a piece of culture has been lost,\u201d she said.\nBooks will spend weeks in an oxygen-free environment\nTo kill the beetles, the crates of books are being placed into tall, hermetically sealed plastic sacks from which all oxygen is removed. After six weeks in the pure nitrogen environment, the abbey hopes all the beetles will be destroyed.\nBefore being reshelved, each book will be individually inspected and vacuumed. Any book damaged by the pests will be set aside for later restoration work.\nClimate change may have contributed\nThe abbey, which hopes to reopen the library at the beginning of next year, believes the effects of climate change played a role in spurring the beetle infestation as average temperatures rise rapidly in Hungary.\nHajdu, the chief restorer, said higher temperatures have allowed the beetles to undergo several more development cycles annually than they could in cooler weather.\n\u201cHigher temperatures are favorable for the life of insects,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far we\u2019ve mostly dealt with mold damage in both depositories and in open collections. But now I think more and more insect infestations will appear due to global warming.\u201d\nThe library\u2019s director said life in a Benedictine abbey is governed by a set of rules in use for nearly 15 centuries, a code that obliges them to do everything possible to save its vast collection.\n\u201cIt says in the Rule of Saint Benedict that all the property of the monastery should be considered as of the same value as the sacred vessel of the altar,\u201d \u00c1sv\u00e1nyi said. \u201cI feel the responsibility of what this preservation and conservation really means.\u201d\nSpike writes for the Associated Press."

He is being charged with visa fraud.\nAttorney David L. Anderson and FBI Special Agent John F.

      "text": "$550,000 Strad Violin Stolen at L.A. Airport\n- Share via\nWhat was to be a vacation quickly turned into \u201ca nightmare\u201d for Erich Gruenberg, when his rare Stradivarius violin, valued at $550,000, was stolen shortly after he arrived at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\u201cIt is irreplaceable,\u201d the 65-year-old English concert violinist said Wednesday. \u201cIt is my life.\u201d\nLos Angeles police said the Stradivarius, along with a second Hirsch violin valued at $8,000, were stolen Tuesday afternoon, shortly after Gruenberg and his wife, Korshed, arrived from England on a British Airways flight.\n\u201cThey were taken off a cart after he cleared customs,\u201d said Detective William Martin, the LAPD\u2019s specialist in art theft.\nThe detective said he believes that the thieves probably did not know the simple, tan-colored oblong case contained violins.\n\u201cUnless they had X-ray vision, they couldn\u2019t know what was inside,\u201d Martin said.\nPolice statistics show there have been an average 181 thefts a month at the airport so far this year, or about six a day.\nOn Wednesday, Gruenberg, apparently yet another victim, kept reliving and retelling those few seconds when the theft occurred, as though he could not believe it happened.\nThe tall, pale Londoner, who has been concertmaster of the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic and is now an international concert soloist, is staying at the Pacific Palisades home of Harold Hirsch, an old friend and the maker of the second stolen violin.\nSeated on a sofa, Gruenberg told a reporter that he was loading his luggage into Hirsch\u2019s Cadillac.\n\u201cI put two suitcases in the trunk.\u201d Gruenberg said, and, as was his custom, went to take the violins inside the car with him.\n\u201cThe violin never goes in the trunk,\u201d Korshed Gruenberg said as she sat nearby, visibly upset and near tears.\nGruenberg continued: \u201cI turned around, I said to my wife, \u2018Darling, where\u2019s the violin?\u2019 I looked right and left, back and forth.\n\u201cThen I thought, this is a bad dream.\u201d\nInstruments created by Antonio Stradivari, the 17th- and 18th-Century violin maker, are considered unsurpassed in sound quality. Only about 650 still exist and they are often used by the world\u2019s leading players.\n\u201cI think the people who took it were not aware of what they took,\u201d Gruenberg said. \u201cI hope they just left it somewhere and somebody will find it, and return it to me.\u201d\nAnyone with knowledge of the instruments\u2019 whereabouts should call the Los Angeles Police Department. The Austrian-born violinist added that he \u201cwould consider some kind of reward\u201d for their return. The instruments are insured, he said.\nGruenberg said he acquired the Stradivarius from a violin dealer in London in 1974.\nFor a serious musician, he said, throughout life \u201cyou try to find an instrument you bond with. You become like a team.\u201d\n\u201cHe just played a few strings of that and I said, \u2018Eric you don\u2019t give it back,\u2019 \u201d Korshed Gruenberg said, recalling the day the couple first saw the Stradivarius. \u201cI love it so much. It\u2019s like mine, too. I feel like someone has kidnaped my daughter.\u201d\nDuring their planned three-week vacation, Gruenberg said, he had agreed to do a private recording of a concerto composed by a UCLA professor later this week. Even though he may not have his precious instrument, or his second violin, Gruenberg said he will still meet the engagement.\n\u201cOf course, you can play any violin,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll borrow another violin from Mr. Hirsch.\u201d\nBut it will make a difference, Gruenberg said.\n\u201cThe difference would be difficult to explain. It\u2019s like defining quality,\u201d the violinist said, quietly. \u201cWhat you pay for in a violin is an indefinable depth and color in sound. If you compare it to a mountain lake, the light shines on it like iridescence, and there is depth; endless depths.\n\u201cWith other instruments in five minutes, they can\u2019t give me anything new.\u201d"
