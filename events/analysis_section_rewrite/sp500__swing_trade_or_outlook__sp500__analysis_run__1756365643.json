      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid starting point but needs tightening to meet the “world‑class” standard. First, each of the four movers‑and‑scenarios must include all five required fields: **Up/Down**, **Time window**, **Driver/Mechanism**, **What to watch**, and **Probability %**. The current lines omit the “What to watch” field and the probabilities are inconsistent (they sum to > 100 % and lack evidence). Replace the generic “Fed easing continues” line with a concrete mechanism such as “Fed minutes show dovish tone (YX2J8NHZ1)” and attach a probability that reflects the 85 % likelihood of a 25‑bp cut cited in the source. For the ad‑tier scenario, cite (61SVFUKBY) for the > 3 % revenue share target and give a probability that reflects the 60 % chance that ad‑tier revenue will hit that level (supported by the current 3 % share trend). For the content‑cost blow‑out, use (61SVFUKBY) to justify a 20 % probability that spend will exceed $18 B. For the Fed‑tightening scenario, cite (17F49LURJ) and give a 30 % probability that CPI > 3.5 % or jobs > 200 k will trigger a rate hike. Each scenario should list a “What to watch” cue: e.g., Q3 earnings for ad‑tier, CPI/jobs releases for tightening, and content‑spend figures for the blow‑out.  \n\nSecond, the swing‑trade line must obey the exact format: **Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100**. Your entry/stop/target ($190/$180/$210) lack a cited support/resistance rationale; use the $200–$220 price‑target range from (61SVFUKBY) to justify a target of $210 and derive a 1.5 R/R from a $30 upside vs. $20 downside. The “Invalidation” field should list both ad‑tier < 3 % **and** content spend > $18 B, citing (61SVFUKBY). The “Trigger” is Q3 2025 earnings, again citing (61SVFUKBY). The probability for the trade should be the joint probability that ad‑tier > 3 % **and** no blow‑out occurs: 0.60 × 0.80 ≈ 48 % (assuming a 20 % blow‑out risk). Round to 48 % and set confidence at 70 % based on the strength of the evidence.  \n\nFinally, ensure every factual claim has an in‑text citation (e.g., ad‑tier > 3 % (61SVFUKBY), Fed minutes (YX2J8NHZ1), CPI/jobs (17F49LURJ)). Remove any un‑cited numbers or generic statements. The revised output should read:\n\n```\nUp | 3–6 months | Ad‑tier revenue >3% of total | Q3 earnings ad‑tier revenue >3% (61SVFUKBY) | 48%\nUp | 3–6 months | Fed minutes show dovish tone | Fed minutes dovish (YX2J8NHZ1) | 85%\nDown | 3–6 months | Content spend >$18 B | Q3 earnings content spend >$18 B (61SVFUKBY) | 20%\nDown | 3–6 months | CPI >3.5 % or jobs >200k | CPI/jobs releases (17F49LURJ) | 30%\n\nBuy | 3–6 months | $190 | $180 | $210 | 1.5 | ad‑tier <3% or content spend >$18B (61SVFUKBY) | Q3 2025 earnings (61SVFUKBY) | 48% | 70\n```\n\nThis version aligns with the required format, grounds probabilities in the source material, and provides clear, actionable signals.",
