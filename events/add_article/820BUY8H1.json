      "summary": "An appeals court has overturned a $500 million civil fraud penalty against former President Donald Trump and his sons, which had been imposed by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump celebrated the ruling as a 'big win' and criticized James and the judge involved, while James stated that the court upheld the finding that Trump engaged in fraud by exaggerating his wealth. She plans to appeal the decision, emphasizing that the case still has merit despite the penalty being overturned.",
