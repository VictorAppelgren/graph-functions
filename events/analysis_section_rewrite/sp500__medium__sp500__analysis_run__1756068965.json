      "feedback": "Strong attempt to fuse policy, auto-capex, and dividend-driven defensives into a 3–6 month view, with base case plus 2 alts and a watch-list; however, the piece slides into a few world-class weaknesses that undermine signal quality and testability. Actionable edits (in one pass): replace the fictional “IntelOrbis Graph” with a named, testable scenario map (e.g., base, tariff-escalation, AI/EV-led leadership) and attach explicit probability weights (e.g., base 45–55%, tariff escalation 20–30%, AI/EV-led 25–35%), then anchor each scenario to a 1–3 quarter timing window with concrete milestones (tariff decision timetables, GM capex cadence, Costa Coffee sale progress, KO/PG dividend actions).Introduce a causal chain that starts with a policy trigger (25% auto tariff, per WTNT85IPR) → pricing/inflation pass-through and consumer spend → sector earnings (KO/PG/SBUX cash flow) and capex/lead-time effects in autos → ETF/stock-rotation signals (IUSV tilt, dividend-growth stocks).Quantify impact where possible: cite KO forward yield ~2.89% and P/E around mid-20s, PG yield ~2.7–2.9% and FCF, SBUX dividend trend, GM capex guidance ($10–$12B through 2027) from WTNT85IPR/GM content; quantify IUSV as a large-cap, low-vol framework from 4661GWFP7; specify potential price/vol shifts under each scenario (e.g., tariff uplift could push near-term consumer inflation plus a 1–2% sector multiple compression, offset by domestic capex).Add sharper catalysts and invalidation rules: tariff pass/fail dates; GM manufacturing announcements; Costa Coffee sale bids/valuation around £2B; Disney’s 2026 shift in park perks as a proxy for demand-signal elasticity; Nvidia/AI-cycle momentum as a second-order driver (supporting 4661GWFP7 framing).Make the macro inputs explicit (inflation prints, unemployment, consumer confidence) and tie them to triggers rather than narrating loosely; include a clear numerical watch-list with thresholds (tariff announcements, KO/PG dividend action, GM capex surprises, IUSV-flow signals).Tighten the narrative by aligning every assertion to a cited source (place STBVARD8F after Coca-Cola/M&A observations, WTNT85IPR after tariff/GM content, U3ZK13ZQI after Disney, YX2J8NHZ1 after dividend-stock mapping, 4661GWFP7 after IUSV).Address style and scope issues: drop or rename the nonessential framing to a conventional scenario map; ensure the 3–6 month horizon ends with a crisp base case, 1–2 explicit alts, a succinct list of risks, watch-list signals, and a quantified confidence level (e.g., moderate) tied to the probability weights and trigger thresholds. This will elevate depth, first-principles coherence, and the practical, decision-useful nature of the piece.",
