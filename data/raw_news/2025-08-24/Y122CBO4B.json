  "title": "George Clooney\u2019s Italian Job: Memorable Moments From the Venice Film Festival and Beyond",
  "description": "George Clooney has a long history with Venice, from film premieres to his wedding",
  "content": "Twenty-seven years ago he attended his first Venice Film Festival with the instant classic \u201cOut of Sight\u201d; 20 years ago, it\u2019s where he debuted his sophomore film, \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck,\u201d which earned him his first best director nomination; and 11 years ago, it\u2019s where he exchanged vows with then Amal Alamuddin, at the Aman Venice, a five-star hotel perched alongside the Grand Canal.\n\nThis year he\u2019ll be back on the Lido again with Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cJay Kelly,\u201d in which he plays a middle-aged movie star on a journey through Europe with his manager, played by Adam Sandler. And his longtime friend and oft co-star Julia Roberts is making her Venice debut this year with \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d\n\nDuring the trip, he also inspired a cocktail still served at the ritzy Belmond Hotel Cipriani on Giudecca. One night he retreated to the hotel\u2019s Gabbiano Bar where his friend, the legendary bar manager Walter Bolzonella, mixed him a drink of lemon, sugar, vodka, cranberry juice, ginger and Angostura bitters and named it Buona Notte in honor of the film. The two would later name a prosecco, passionfruit and elderflower cocktail La Nina after Clooney\u2019s mother, which was served at his wedding.\n\nTony Gilroy\u2019s \u201cMichael Clayton,\u201d which nabbed Clooney an Oscar nomination for his turn as the titular law firm fixer, played in competition at Venice. The top prize went again to an Ang Lee film: \u201cLust, Caution,\u201d which also beat out the likes of \u201cI\u2019m Not There,\u201d \u201cAtonement\u201d and \u201cThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.\u201d\n\nThis Coen brothers comedy featuring Clooney and Brad Pitt opted to debut out of competition in the opening night slot. He said it completed his \u201ctrilogy of idiots\u201d that he\u2019d played for the Coens, including \u201cIntolerable Cruelty\u201d and \u201cO Brother, Where Art Thou?\u201d \u201cLooking at the parts we are playing, I\u2019m very concerned about what you think of us,\u201d Clooney said at the press conference. Pitt, who\u2019d won the festival\u2019s acting prize the year prior, added: \u201cLike George \u2026 I\u2019m not sure if I should be flattered or insulted.\u201d\n\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cGravity\u201d opened the 70th edition of the Venice Film Festival before going on to win seven Oscars. Clooney, of course, attended the premiere alongside Sandra Bullock and he was self-deprecating about his role: \u201cThere were only two parts and Sandy had the other one, so I felt like this was the only one I could get away with.\u201d\n\nThe canals were packed with paparazzi for the nuptials of one of Hollywood\u2019s favorite bachelors. On Sept. 27, Clooney, then 53, and Alamuddin, then 36, exchanged vows in front of 100 of their closest friends and family, including Bono and Matt Damon, at the luxury hotel Aman Grand Canal, originally a grand palazzo built in 1550. She wore a custom Oscar de la Renta dress, of French lace, pearls and diamant\u00e9 accents. He wore a black wool/cashmere Giorgio Armani tuxedo.\n\nClooney returned to the festival with another of his directing projects, \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d a dark comedic satire about a seemingly idyllic 1950s community with Damon and Julianne Moore. This festival was especially notable for it being the Clooneys\u2019 first public appearance since the birth of their twins, Alexander and Ella, a few months prior.\n\nThis time George was the plus one to Amal, who was receiving an award from the Diane von Furstenberg and The Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation for her work as a human rights lawyer. The power couple gave the festival some much-needed star power amid the actors strike with an appearance at the adjacent DVF Awards. \u201cI am here in Venice with my husband; he is a rising star,\u201d she said that night. \u201cI just wanted to say, you, my love, like this city, take my breath away.\u201d\n\nClooney and Pitt reunited for the Jon Watts action comedy \u201cWolfs,\u201d that played out of competition. But the spotlight was less on the film and more on the off-screen drama of the AppleTV+ produced film only getting a limited theatrical release, and his then-recent New York Times op-ed urging President Joe Biden to end his reelection bid.\n\n\u201cThe person who should be applauded is the president who did the most selfless thing anyone\u2019s done since George Washington,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cAll the machinations that got us there, none of that\u2019s going to be remembered. And it shouldn\u2019t be. What should be remembered is the selfless act.\u201d",

      "text": "Actor George Clooney, a high-profile Biden supporter and fundraiser, asks president to leave race\nActor George Clooney, a high-profile Biden supporter and fundraiser, asks president to leave race\nLive updates: Follow AP\u2019s latest coverage of election 2024.\nMovie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney added his voice to calls for Joe Biden to leave the presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after headlining a fundraiser that brought in a record single-night haul for the president\u2019s reelection campaign.\nClooney said in a New York Times opinion piece that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race as well as any control in Congress with him as the nominee.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I\u2019ve spoken with in private,\u201d wrote Clooney. He\u2019s hosted several high-dollar Hollywood fundraisers, including for Biden last month.\nClooney argued the party should pick a new nominee at its convention next month, saying the process would be \u201cmessy\u201d but \u201cwake up\u201d voters in the party\u2019s favor, mentioning Vice President Kamala Harris and Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California among those from who the country should now hear.\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports one of President Biden\u2019s highest-profile Hollywood backers is joining calls for him to abandon his reelection bid.\nFocusing much of his piece around Biden\u2019s age, Clooney noted differences he saw in the 81-year-old president during their recent Los Angeles event compared to years past.\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u2018big F-ing deal\u2019 Biden of 2010,\u201d Clooney wrote. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\u201d\nLast month, Clooney, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand were among those who took the stage for a fundraiser that took in a record $30 million-plus for Biden, in hopes of energizing would-be supporters for a White House contest they said may rank among the most consequential in U.S. history.\nClooney isn\u2019t alone in his characterization of his recent exchange with Biden.\nBiden\u2019s shaky June 27 debate performance is causing cracks in the White House.\nInternal drama, leaks and second-guessing swirls.\n- The White House has since faced many questions about Biden\u2019s health and medical history. Here\u2019s the latest.\n- Behind closed doors, Senate Democrats have expressed deep concerns about whether Biden can win November\u2019s election.\n- The mood for Democrats on Capitol Hill is grimly uncertain, as Biden faces calls to drop out of the race.\nA person who interacted closely with Biden described the president as vibrant and engaging at a fundraiser in March but, at the Los Angeles event months later, said they noticed a notable diminishment in Biden\u2019s presence.\nThe person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private interactions with the president, recalled being struck by how tired and \u201cout of it\u201d the president seemed during backstage conversations at the Los Angeles event, adding that they gave Biden the benefit of the doubt for not being as voluble and showing lower energy off-stage because he arrived in Los Angeles after traveling from Italy where he had attended an international summit.\nAsked for comment on Clooney\u2019s essay, Biden\u2019s campaign pointed to the president\u2019s letter to congressional Democrats earlier in the week vowing to stay in the race.\nHis team also disputed the actor\u2019s representation of Biden\u2019s demeanor during the Los Angeles fundraiser, with campaign officials who attended the event pointing out that the president stayed for more than three hours at the event, despite just having returned from Europe.\nLuminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden\u2019s campaign. Leading up to the fundraiser, Clooney\u2019s name appeared on numerous fundraising missives from the campaign, which he called \u201cthe fight of our lives.\u201d\nRepresentatives for Clooney did not immediately return a message seeking comment on insight into his decision, when precisely he had made it or how recently he had spoken with Biden.\nBiden has refused to end his reelection bid after his weak debate performance against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on June 27.\n___\nKinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina.

(Photo by Joel Ryan/Invision/AP)\nVENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Affable, handsome George Clooney was all charm at the Venice Film Festival on Saturday, but don\u2019t be fooled.\nThe actor says his latest directorial effort, \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d is an angry movie for an angry country \u2014 his own. It\u2019s a twisted tale of darkness at the heart of the American dream.\n\u201cA lot of us are angry \u2014 angry at ourselves, angry at the way that the country is going, angry at the way the world is going,\u201d Clooney told reporters Saturday in Venice, Italy, where \u201cSuburbicon\u201d is competing for the festival\u2019s Golden Lion prize.\nClooney was joined by his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, on the Venice red carpet Saturday. The couple are parents of twins, born in June, and have an Italian home nearby on Lake Como.\nAt a news conference earlier in the day, Clooney said the U.S. now is \u201cprobably the angriest I have ever seen the country, and I lived through the Watergate period of time.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a dark cloud hanging over our country right now,\u201d he said.\nAmerica\u2019s divisions give an unnerving timeliness to \u201cSuburbicon.\u201d The satirical film noir stars Matt Damon and Julianne Moore as residents of a seemingly idyllic \u2014 and all-white \u2014 1950s suburban community that erupts in anger when a black family moves in.\nIt fuses a script by the Coen brothers with a narrative about racial divisions inspired \u2014 in a negative way \u2014 by Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\u201cI was watching a lot of speeches on the campaign trail about building fences and scapegoating minorities,\u201d Clooney said.\nThat set Clooney and writing-producing partner Grant Heslov to thinking about other points in United States history when forces of division were in the ascendant. They remembered 1957 events in Levittown, Pennsylvania, a model suburban community where white residents rioted at the arrival of a black family.\nThey fused that idea to an unproduced script by Joel and Ethan Coen about a similar white-picket-fence community where a crime goes horribly wrong in farcically bloody ways.\nThe images of white rage in the movie feel unnervingly contemporary, recalling last month\u2019s rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\u201cUnfortunately, these are issues that are never out of vogue in our country,\u201d Clooney said ahead of the film\u2019s red carpet premiere. \u201cWe are still trying to exorcise these problems. We\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do from our original sin of slavery and racism.\u201d\nOn one level, \u201cSuburbicon\u201d is a comedy, in which the best-laid plans of Damon\u2019s scheming corporate executive go bloodily astray. Damon and Moore practically explode with suburban repression, and there\u2019s a delicious turn by Oscar Isaac as a prying insurance investigator.\nSaturday was Damon\u2019s second time on the Venice red carpet this week. He also stars in Alexander Payne\u2019s \u201cDownsizing,\u201d in which \u2014 as so often \u2014 he portrays a likable everyman.\nBut Damon also can play the psychopath, as he demonstrated memorably in \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley.\u201d In \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d he\u2019s a bland suburbanite who becomes a monster.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really get to play the bad guy a lot, but I do get a nice range of roles,\u201d Damon said.\nHe recalled Payne telling him, \u201cI like you because you don\u2019t look like a movie star.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I know exactly what he meant,\u201d Damon said. \u201cI look kind of like an average American person, so I think directors get to have fun playing with different variations of what that might mean.\u201d\nFor all the bloody fun in \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d the social concerns Clooney displayed in previous films he directed \u2014 including \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck\u201d and \u201cThe Ides of March\u201d \u2014 are never far from the surface.\nThe Clooney Foundation he and wife run gave $1 million in the wake of Charlottesville to the Southern Poverty Law Center to combat hate groups.\nClooney said he was anxious that \u201cSuburbicon\u201d not be a polemic or \u201ca civics lesson.\u201d\n\u201cWe wanted it to be funny, we wanted it to be mean,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is certainly angry, and it got angrier as we were shooting.\u201d"

      "text": "Clooney marries human rights lawyer in Venice\nVENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 George Clooney married human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin Saturday, the actor\u2019s representative said, out of sight of pursuing paparazzi and adoring crowds.\nA smiling Clooney traveled up the spectacular Grand Canal to his wedding standing coolly aboard a water-taxi, waving to hundreds of well-wishers on shore and a flotilla of photographers chasing a glimpse of his final moments of bachelorhood.\nWith the pink sunset casting a gleam on Venice\u2019s most picturesque canal, Clooney rubbed his hands in sweet anticipation and disappeared into the luxury Aman hotel\u2019s tent-covered pier, where celebrity friends including Cindy Crawford and Matt Damon had passed moments earlier.\nThe bride was nowhere to be seen.\nClooney\u2019s long-time representative Stan Rosenfield announced in one sentence some 2 \u00bd hours later that the wedding had taken place. It is expected to be the only communication on the much-anticipated marriage of the actor who long reigned as Hollywood\u2019s most-eligible bachelor.\nClooney and friends had coolly sipped champagne before at the five-star Cipriani hotel before forming a procession to the Aman that included Damon, Crawford, her husband Rande Gerber and Bill Murray from the five-star Cipriani hotel opposite St. Mark\u2019s Square up the Grand Canal to the luxury Aman Hotel.\nCrawford wore a purple floor-length halter dress; Clooney and the other men were all dressed in tuxedos.\nEn route, Clooney\u2019s boat was momentarily blocked by a passing cruise-liner and then by a water bus, giving time for dozens of boats carrying photographers to catch up. A police boat swerved in vain to try to keep the paparazzi away.\nThe star, standing in front of the taxi, maintained his ever-relaxed demeanor and waved to hundreds of people who crowded the arched Accademia bridge, canal banks and passing water taxis to see the Hollywood star before he took the plunge he long vowed never to take.\nAlamuddin was last seen publicly on Friday riding a water-taxi down the Grand Canal with Clooney\u2019s arm resting comfortably around her. The bride, wearing a bold black-and-white striped Dolce & Gabbana dress, beamed.\nClooney, 53, and Alamuddin, 36, who were engaged in April, have not publicly divulged details of the weekend-long celebrations \u2014 leaving plenty open to speculation.\nVenice city officials have announced the closure of a 50-meter (yard) length of pedestrian way along the Grand Canal near the 16th-century Cavalli Palace, used for civil marriage ceremonies, for two hours on Monday, citing the Clooney nuptials. The Cavalli Palace is just opposite the Aman hotel.\nMedia have speculated that the couple will have two ceremonies \u2014 one on Saturday followed by a civil ceremony Monday.\nClooney started the day Saturday relaxing over coffee with Crawford and her husband on the Cipriani hotel terrace, seemingly unfazed by photographers hovering in boats off-shore.\nCipriani staff formed a protective barrier blocking the view of Clooney and his guests, but then Clooney apparently waved them away. The actor even interacted briefly with the paparazzi.\nAfter someone yelled \u201cIs this really happening, George?\u201d the actor feigned looking at a watch on his bare wrist and yelled back: \u201cYeah, right now.\u201d\nClooney had vowed he would never marry again following his 1989-93 marriage to Talia Balsam. He dated a series of models and actresses that made his love life tabloid fodder, until meeting his match in Alamuddin.\nVenice is perhaps a natural setting for Clooney\u2019s wedding. The star owns a villa on Lake Como north of Milan, feels at home in Italy and is a frequent visitor to Venice, often to promote his films at the Venice Film Festival.\nWhile the Venetian waterways offer stunning views of the city\u2019s Byzantine and Renaissance architecture, where East truly meets West. Its islands and maze of canals also permit privacy and easily restricted access.\nSinger Bono and his wife were among the late arrivals on Saturday, joining Clooney\u2019s cousin Miguel Ferrer, Ellen Barkin, Anna Wintour and Richard Kind, among those who arrived on Friday.\nClooney and Alamuddin are among thousands of non-Venetian couples, foreign and Italian, who choose each year to marry in Venice, and the city administration smooths over the process with an on-line application form and list of documents needed to make the ceremony legally binding.\nIn St. Mark\u2019s Square, a bride dressed in white was kissing her groom as photographers snapped away. The couple said they didn\u2019t mind sharing the spotlight with the Hollywood star and his bride.\n\u201cIt is a pleasure for us that a person as famous as him is celebrating his wedding here just like us,\u201d said Michele Santoriello.\nAlamuddin, a London-based human rights lawyer, is of Lebanese origin, and her wedding was also being celebrated Saturday in her family\u2019s village of origin, Baakline in the Chouf district. Alamuddin left Lebanon during the civil war and was raised in the United Kingdom. She met Clooney, who is active in many political causes, through her work.\nAs the wedding party descended on Venice, the Alamuddin family house in Baakline was empty. Her neighbors said the bride\u2019s cousins departed the night before.\nMany villagers welcomed the news of the impending nuptials. \u201cWe congratulate them and we hope that the happiness will be international,\u201d said shopkeeper Ghassan Bou Hatoum.\n____\nLuca Bruno in Venice, Maeva Bambuck in Baakline, Lebanon and Colleen Barry in Milan contributed to this report."

(Photo by Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP)\n\u201cThe person who should be applauded is the president who did the most selfless thing anyone\u2019s done since George Washington,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cAll the machinations that got us there, none of that\u2019s going to be remembered. And it shouldn\u2019t be. What should be remembered is the selfless act.\u201d\nClooney continued: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to let go of power. We know that. We\u2019ve seen that all around the world. For someone to say, I think there\u2019s a better way forward? All credit goes to him.\u201d\nMost of the discussion was focused on the film, however, an old school action thriller directed by Jon Watts, in which they play lone wolf fixers unhappy to have been hired for the same job to cover up a bloody mess involving a district attorney (played by Amy Ryan).\nThe film will have a limited theatrical release, starting Sept. 20, before hitting Apple TV+ on Sept. 27. Apple TV+ acquired \u201cWolfs\u201d in a competitive bidding war, beating out both traditional studios and rival streaming services.\nAmal Clooney, from left, George Clooney, Ines de Ramon, and Brad Pitt pose for photographers upon arrival for the premiere of the film \u2018Wolfs\u2019 during the 81st edition of the Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy, on Sunday, Sept. 1, 2024. (Photo by Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP)\nDeadline reported in 2021 that the understanding was that it would come with a robust theatrical release, something the stars may have also forfeited money to ensure, the trade publication said. Then, several weeks ago the streamer announced different plans: Theatrical would be limited. Streaming would be quick.\nClooney confirmed that they did forfeit some of their salaries to guarantee a theatrical release and that it\u2019s a \u201cbummer\u201d that it won\u2019t be wider than a few hundred theaters.\n\u201cWe would have liked it, we wanted it. That\u2019s why Brad and I gave some of our money back,\u201d he said, adding that a report in the New York Times overestimated the dollar amount of their salaries by millions.\nFar from being anti-streaming, however, Clooney said that everyone is simply finding their way during this revolution. There are bumps and mistakes, but there\u2019s also much more opportunities for actors, he said.\nAmal Clooney, left, and George Clooney pose for photographers upon arrival for the premiere of the film \u2018Wolfs\u2019 during the 81st edition of the Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy, on Sunday, Sept. 1, 2024. (Photo by Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP)\n\u201cStreaming, we need it, our industry needs it,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cThey also benefit from having films released \u2026 and we\u2019re figuring it out, we haven\u2019t gotten it figured out yet.\u201d\nProducer and Plan B executive Jeremy Kliner, who has worked with Pitt for over 20 years, said that they make films believing in their shelf lives, and that they\u2019re doing something worthwhile.\nPitt added: \u201cI think we\u2019ll always be romantic about the theatrical experience but at the same time I love the existence of streamers \u2026 it\u2019s a delicate balance. It\u2019ll right itself.\u201d\nThough both regulars at the picturesque festival on their own, with Clooney\u2019s premieres including \u201cGravity\u201d and \u201cGood Night and Good Luck,\u201d and \u201cAd Astra\u201d and \u201cThe Assassination of Jesse James\u2026\u201d among Pitt\u2019s, only once have they walked the carpet together. No, it wasn\u2019t for an Ocean\u2019s film. It was in 2008, for the premiere of \u201cBurn After Reading,\u201d the madcap Coen brothers\u2019 farce in which they share one memorable scene.\n\u201cIn \u2018Burn After Reading\u2019 I got the extreme pleasure of shooting him in the face and I thought maybe we\u2019d try it again 15 years later,\u201d Clooney said with a laugh.\nThe two teased one another about each other\u2019s age and relevance, with Clooney joking that Pitt is 74 and lucky to be working at his age. (Clooney, for the record, is 63. Pitt is 60.)\nGeorge Clooney, left, and Brad Pitt upon arrival for the press conference of the film \u2018Wolfs\u2019 during the 81st edition of the Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy, on Sunday, Sept. 1, 2024.

Their years of working together made their banter, and overlapping dialogue, natural to do.\n\u201cAs I get older, just working with the people that I just really enjoy spending time with has become really important to me,\u201d Pitt said.\nWhen they got the script, they said Watts hadn\u2019t specified who was playing which part so Pitt and Clooney got on the phone and figured it out for themselves.\nPitt arrived at the festival just days apart from his ex, Angelina Jolie, who received praise for her turn as opera singer Maria Callas in Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s \u201cMaria\u201d and left Italy for another festival soon after.\nBrad Pitt poses for photographers upon arrival for the premiere of the film \u2018Wolfs\u2019 during the 81st edition of the Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy, on Sunday, Sept. 1, 2024.

Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, and a judge declared them single in 2019, but the divorce case has not been finalized with custody and financial issues still in dispute. Several weeks ago, a Los Angeles court granted a petition from the third-eldest child of the former couple to legally change her name from Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt to Shiloh Nouvel Jolie.\nThe film\u2019s director, who catapulted from indies to the Tom Holland Spider-Man films, said in a director\u2019s statement that this film is him trying to get back to street level after \u201cseven years of swinging from skyscrapers and jumping through multiverse portals.\u201d He was unable to speak about the film with his stars after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\u201cHe flew all the way here and then he got COVID,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cSo now we\u2019re all going to get it.\u201d\n___\nFor more coverage of the 2024 Venice Film Festival, visit https://apnews.com/hub/venice-film-festival"

      "text": "Best-selling author Elmore Leonard dies at 87\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 He was the master of his genre, the Dickens of Detroit, the Chaucer of Crime.\nPretty much every novel Elmore Leonard wrote from the mid-1980s on was a best-seller, and every fan of crime stories knew his name. George Clooney was an admirer. So were Quentin Tarantino, Saul Bellow and Stephen King and millions of ordinary readers.\nLeonard, who died Tuesday at age 87, helped achieve for crime writing what King did for horror and Ray Bradbury for science fiction. He made it hip, and he made it respectable.\nWhen the public flocked to watch John Travolta in the movie version of \u201cGet Shorty\u201d in 1995, its author became the darling of Hollywood\u2019s hottest young directors. Book critics and literary stars, prone to dismissing crime novels as light entertainment, competed for adjectives to praise him. Last fall, he became the first crime writer to receive an honorary National Book Award, a prize given in the past to Philip Roth, Norman Mailer and Arthur Miller.\nFew writers so memorably traveled the low road. His more than 40 novels were peopled by pathetic schemers, clever conmen and casual killers. Each was characterized by moral ambivalence about crime, black humor and wickedly acute depictions of human nature: the greedy dreams of Armand Degas in \u201cKillshot,\u201d the wisecracking cool of Chili Palmer in \u201cGet Shorty,\u201d Jack Belmont\u2019s lust for notoriety in \u201cThe Hot Kid.\u201d\nLeonard\u2019s novels and short stories were turned into dozens of feature films, TV movies and series, including the current FX show \u201cJustified,\u201d which stars Timothy Olyphant as one of Leonard\u2019s signature characters, the cool-under-pressure U.S. marshal Raylan Givens.\nCritics loved Leonard\u2019s flawlessly unadorned, colloquial style, as well as how real his characters sounded when they spoke.\n\u201cPeople always say, \u2018Where do you get (your characters\u2019) words?\u2019 And I say, \u2018Can\u2019t you remember people talking or think up people talking in your head?\u2019 That\u2019s all it is. I don\u2019t know why that seems such a wonder to people,\u201d he told The Associated Press last year.\nLeonard spent much of his childhood in Detroit and set many of his novels in the city. Others were set in Miami near his North Palm Beach, Fla., vacation home.\nHe died at his home in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Township, where he did much of his writing, from complications of a stroke he suffered a few weeks ago, according to his researcher, Gregg Sutter.\nCrime novelist James Lee Burke said Leonard was a \u201cgentleman of the old school\u201d whose stylistic techniques and \u201cexperimentation with point of view and narrative voice had an enormous influence on hundreds of publishing writers.\u201d\nLeonard\u2019s work contained moral and political themes without being didactic, Burke said. \u201cAnd he was able to write social satire disguised as a crime novel, or he could write a crime novel disguised as social satire.\u201d\nLeonard didn\u2019t have a best-seller until he was 60, and few critics took him seriously before the 1990s. Now the Library of America, which publishes hardcover editions of classic American writing, is planning a three-volume set of his work.\nHe had some minor successes in the 1950s and \u201860s writing Western stories and novels, a couple of which were made into movies. But when interest in the Western dried up, he turned to writing scripts for educational and industrial films while trying his hand at another genre: crime novels.\nThe first, \u201cThe Big Bounce,\u201d was rejected many times before it was published as a paperback in 1969. Hollywood came calling again, paying $50,000 for the rights and turning it into a movie starring Ryan O\u2019Neal that even Leonard called \u201cterrible.\u201d\nHe followed up with several more fast-paced crime novels, including \u201cSwag\u201d (1976). Leonard was already following the advice he would later give to young writers: \u201cTry to leave out the parts that people skip.\u201d\nIn 1978, he was commissioned to write an article about the Detroit Police Department and shadowed police officers for nearly three months. Starting with \u201cCity Primeval\u201d in 1980, his crime novels gained a new authenticity, with quirky but believable characters and crisp, slangy dialogue. But sales remained light.\nDonald I. Fine, an editor at Arbor House, thought they deserved better and promised to put the muscle of his publicity department behind them. He delivered: In 1985, \u201cGlitz,\u201d a stylish novel of vengeance set in Atlantic City, became Leonard\u2019s first best-seller.\nHollywood rediscovered him, churning out a succession of bad movies, including \u201c52 Pick-up\u201d starring Roy Scheider.\nIt took Barry Sonnenfeld to finally show Hollywood how to turn a Leonard novel into a really good movie. \u201cGet Shorty\u201d was the first to feel and sound like a true Leonard story.\nThen Quentin Tarantino took a turn with \u201cRum Punch,\u201d turning it into \u201cJackie Brown,\u201d a campy film starring Pam Grier. But Steven Soderbergh stayed faithful to Leonard\u2019s story and dialogue with \u201cOut of Sight.\u201d\nThere are more adaptations of Leonard novels on the way. In September, \u201cLife of Crime,\u201d based on Leonard\u2019s \u201cThe Switch,\u201d will premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. It stars John Hawkes and Jennifer Aniston.\nSutter said Leonard had seen \u201ca little bit of the film and liked what he saw.\u201d\nWriting well into his 80s, Leonard\u2019s process remained the same.\nHe settled in at his home office around 10 a.m. behind a desk covered with stacks of paper and books. He lit a cigarette and began writing longhand on the 63-page unlined yellow pads that were custom-made for him.\nWhen he finished a page, Leonard transferred the words onto a separate piece of paper using an electric typewriter. He tried to complete between three and five pages by the time his workday ended at 6 p.m.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got to put in the time if you want to write a book,\u201d Leonard told AP in 2010.\nLeonard sold his first story, \u201cTrail of the Apache,\u201d in 1951, and followed with 30 more for such magazines as \u201cDime Western,\u201d earning 2 or 3 cents a word. At the time, he was working in advertising, but he would wake up early to work on his fiction before trudging off to write Chevrolet ads.\nOne story, \u201c3:10 to Yuma,\u201d became a noted 1956 movie starring Glenn Ford. That same year, \u201cThe Captives\u201d was made into a film called \u201cThe Tall T.\u201d But the small windfall wasn\u2019t enough for Leonard to quit his day job. (\u201c3:10 to Yuma\u201d was remade in 2007, starring Russell Crowe.)\nHis first novel, \u201cThe Bounty Hunters,\u201d was published in 1953, and he wrote four more in the next eight years. One of them, \u201cHombre,\u201d about a white man raised by Apaches, was a breakthrough for the struggling young writer. When 20th Century Fox bought the rights for $10,000 in 1967, he quit the ad business to write full time.\n\u201cHombre\u201d became a pretty good movie starring Paul Newman, and the book was named one of the greatest Westerns of all time by the Western Writers of America.\nSoon, another Leonard Western, \u201cValdez Is Coming,\u201d became a star vehicle for Burt Lancaster. But as the 1960s ended, the market for Westerns fizzled. Leonard wrote five more, but they sold poorly, and Hollywood lost interest.\nLeonard was born in New Orleans on Oct. 11, 1925, the son of General Motors executive Elmore John Leonard and his wife, Flora.\nThe family settled near Detroit when young Elmore was a boy. The tough, undersized young man played quarterback in high school and earned the nickname \u201cDutch,\u201d after Emil \u201cDutch\u201d Leonard, a knuckleball pitcher of the day. The ballplayer\u2019s card sat for years in the writer\u2019s study on one of the shelves lined with copies of his books.\nAfter serving in the Navy during World War II, he majored in English at the University of Detroit. He started writing copy for an advertising agency before his graduation in 1950.\nHe married three times and had five children.\nHis son, Peter, followed in his father\u2019s path, going into advertising for years before achieving his own success as a novelist with his 2008 debut, \u201cQuiver.\u201d\nA visitation was scheduled for Friday in the Detroit suburb of Clawson, to be followed by a funeral Mass Saturday in nearby Birmingham.\nIn 2012, after learning he was to become a National Book Award lifetime achievement recipient, Leonard said he had no intention of ending his life\u2019s work.\n\u201cI probably won\u2019t quit until I just quit everything \u2014 quit my life \u2014 because it\u2019s all I know how to do,\u201d he told the AP at the time. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fun. I do have fun writing, and a long time ago, I told myself, \u2018You got to have fun at this, or it\u2019ll drive you nuts.\u2019\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press National Writer Hillel Italie in New York and AP Entertainment Writer Jake Coyle in New York contributed to this report."
