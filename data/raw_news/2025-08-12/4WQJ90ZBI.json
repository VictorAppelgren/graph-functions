      "text": "The Russian government is allegedly behind the data breach affecting the U.S. court filing system known as PACER, according to The New York Times.\nCiting anonymous sources, the newspaper said Russia \u201cis at least in part responsible\u201d for the cyberattack, without saying what part of the Russian government is behind the hack.\nThe hackers searched for \u201cmidlevel criminal cases in the New York City area and several other jurisdictions, with some cases involving people with Russian and Eastern European surnames,\u201d per the article.\nLast week, Politico reported that hackers had broken into the federal judiciary\u2019s electronic case filing system, potentially accessing the identities of confidential informants, which are redacted and not publicly known, putting those people at risk of retaliation from the criminals they are helping authorities apprehend.\nPolitico reported that the stolen data could include sealed criminal dockets and indictments, arrest warrants, and other documents not yet public, or may never actually be included in public dockets.\nThe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the agency that oversees the U.S. federal court system, confirmed a cyberattack in a statement on August 7.\nThe New York Times also quoted a memo sent to Justice Department officials, clerks, and chief judges by the court system\u2019s administrators, which said that \u201cpersistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records.\u201d The email said \u201cthis remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action.\u201d\nThis may not be Russia\u2019s first rodeo targeting the U.S. federal court system.\nIn 2020, a long-running Russian cyberattack targeted the SolarWinds software, used by large tech companies and government agencies, to deliver a tainted software update allowing Russian government hackers backdoor access to the networks of SolarWinds customers.\nThe widespread hack affected several U.S. government departments, including PACER, allowing the theft of sealed court documents.\nThe U.S. Courts, in its statement on August 7, said that the agency was \u201cenhancing security of the system and to block future attacks, and it is prioritizing working with courts to mitigate the impact on litigants.\u201d"

      "text": "The federal Judiciary is taking additional steps to strengthen protections for sensitive case documents in response to recent escalated cyberattacks of a sophisticated and persistent nature on its case management system. The Judiciary is also further enhancing security of the system and to block future attacks, and it is prioritizing working with courts to mitigate the impact on litigants.\nThe Administrative Office of the United States Courts has continued to collaborate with Congress as well as the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and other partners in the executive branch to mitigate the risks and impacts of these cyberattacks.\nThe vast majority of documents filed with the Judiciary\u2019s electronic case management system are not confidential and indeed are readily available to the public, which is fundamental to an open and transparent judicial system. However, some filings contain confidential or proprietary information that are sealed from public view.\nThese sensitive documents can be targets of interest to a range of threat actors. To better protect them, courts have been implementing more rigorous procedures to restrict access to sensitive documents under carefully controlled and monitored circumstances.\nEnhancing the security of its systems is a top priority for the Judiciary. Over the past few years, the Judiciary has added significant cybersecurity protections and safeguards to the case management system. The Chairman of the Judicial Conference\u2019s Committee on Information Technology, Court of Appeals Judge Michael Y. Scudder, briefed the Conference and the media in September 2024 on potential threats to Judiciary IT systems and steps taken by the Judiciary to address them. Subsequently, in June of this year Judge Scudder testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee and underscored the Judiciary\u2019s ongoing commitment to investing in and modernizing its IT systems in order to confront the constant and increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats the branch faces.\nAs other federal government and private entities likewise continue to experience, cyber risks continue to evolve as threat actors grow more sophisticated and change and adapt their tactics, and safeguarding legacy systems poses a particularly difficult challenge. In tackling cybersecurity threats, the Judiciary embraces its security obligations and remains committed to leveraging all available resources to include collaboration with law enforcement, national security and cybersecurity organizations, and other information sharing entities.\nSubscribe to News Updates\nSubscribe to be notified when the news section is updated."

      "text": "Cybersecurity took center stage in 2024 as some of the most sophisticated and damaging attacks in history underscored the vulnerabilities of an increasingly digital operating landscape.\nFrom ransomware attacks crippling critical infrastructure to data breaches compromising millions of user records, the year\u2019s events highlighted the need for robust, proactive security measures in a hyper-connected world.\nAmong the most damaging breaches were the Change Healthcare ransomware attack that led to billions in losses, to the breached defenses at background check firm National Public Data that led to the stolen information of 2.9 billion individuals, as well as the Snowflake data breach that snowballed to include AT&T, Santander Bank, Advance Auto Parts, Ticketmaster parent company LiveNation and over 160 of the world\u2019s largest companies.\nBut those attacks only scratched the surface of emerging enterprise vulnerabilities.\nAs we enter 2025, the lessons from these breaches are more relevant than ever for businesses navigating the digital frontier.\nSee also: 2024 Is Already the Year of the Cyberattack\nKey Trends Shaping the Cyber Threat Landscape\nAmong the top themes shaping the cyberthreat landscape are the rise of Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), artificial intelligence (AI)-driven threats, zero-day exploits, supply chain attacks and more.\n\u201cIt is essentially an adversarial game; criminals are out to make money and the [business] community needs to curtail that activity. What\u2019s different now is that both sides are armed with some really impressive technology,\u201d Michael Shearer, chief solutions officer at Hawk, told PYMNTS.\nThe rise of RaaS platforms lowered the barrier to entry for cybercriminals, enabling even low-skilled actors to launch sophisticated attacks. Combined with the ability of AI to automate phishing campaigns, identify vulnerabilities and evade detection systems, the threat landscape of 2024 grew.\nAt the same time, the prevalence of zero-day vulnerabilities highlighted the need for rapid detection and response capabilities, while third-party software and hardware continued to be a significant vector for attacks, requiring businesses to adopt stricter supply chain risk management practices.\nThe road to cybersecurity resilience is a marathon, not a sprint. As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, so must the defenses designed to thwart them. In an era where data is the new oil, securing it is no longer optional \u2014 it\u2019s imperative.\n\u201cEveryone has been dealing with cybersecurity for a long time,\u201d XiFin Chief Financial Officer Erik Sallee told PYMNTS in an interview posted in June. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it other than blocking and tackling, doing the right thing every day keeping all your systems up to date, making sure you\u2019re working with good vendors and investing in it.\u201d\nRead more: Digital Evolution of Finance Function Sees CFOs Embracing Cyber Duty\nThe Need for Vigilance, Adaptability and Innovation\nIn interviews for the \u201cWhat\u2019s Next in Payments\u201c series, a panel of executives explained to PYMNTS that a multilayered security strategy, also known as defense in depth, reduces risks at various levels.\nAs we move into 2025, organizations and individuals must prioritize cybersecurity as a strategic imperative. Staying secure in 2025 demands an approach that combines technology, education and preparedness. Companies should consider taking steps such as implementing zero-trust architectures, performing regular penetration testing and deploying advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems to reduce vulnerabilities.\nAPIs, a critical component of modern systems, can be particularly vulnerable to attacks. To mitigate these risks, robust authentication and authorization protocols should be implemented, and API usage should be continuously monitored and audited to detect anomalies. Adopting API gateways can further enhance security by centralizing and enforcing controls.\nEducation and training remain key components of a strong cybersecurity strategy, as people often represent the most vulnerable point in any system. Employees should be regularly updated on the latest phishing tactics and cyber threats, while simulated real-world attack scenarios can help build preparedness and resilience.\nAI also plays a vital role in cybersecurity, providing tools for detecting and responding to known attack patterns automatically while identifying anomalies in real time. Businesses can leverage machine learning models to analyze data and predict emerging threats, staying one step ahead of potential attackers.\nPYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s 29-page report, \u201cLeveraging AI and ML to Thwart Scammers,\u201d a collaboration with Hawk, contains eight charts of proprietary data examining the role of ML and AI to help keep fraudsters from getting the upper hand."
