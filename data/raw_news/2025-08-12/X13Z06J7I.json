  "description": "A DNA analysis of two people who lived in Britain in the seventh century reveals they had recent African ancestry.",
  "content": "Two people who lived in England during the Early Middle Ages had recent sub-Saharan African ancestry \u2014 likely from a grandparent, a new analysis reveals.\n\n\"The DNA shows that there is human, as well as material, connection and that it extends into West Africa,\" study co-author , a historical archaeologist at the University of Lancashire in the U.K., told Live Science in an email.\n\nArchaeologists discovered the burial of an adolescent girl at Updown cemetery in Kent and the burial of a young man at Worth Matravers cemetery in Dorset. Both cemeteries, located in southern Britain, were dated to the seventh century, after the fall of the , when Anglo-Saxon peoples occupied the island.\n\nDNA analysis of five people buried at Updown and 18 people buried at Worth Matravers found that most of these individuals had Northern European or western British and Irish ancestry, researchers . But when they sequenced the DNA of the girl buried in grave 47 at Updown, they realized her ancestry came from an entirely different continent.\n\nIn two studies published Wednesday (Aug. 13) in the journal Antiquity, researchers detailed the unusual genetic backgrounds of the girl from and the young man from .\n\nAnalysis of the young people's mitochondrial DNA, which is passed from mother to child, revealed that both had mothers who were likely from Northern Europe. But their autosomal DNA, which comes from chromosomes that do not code for biological sex, showed clear signals of non-European ancestry.\n\n\"Both individuals thus show genetically and geographically mixed descent,\" and had an estimated 20% to 40% ancestry characteristic of sub-Saharan Africa, Sayer and colleagues wrote in the study. Updown girl's DNA had affinity to that of present-day , Mende, Mandenka and Esan groups, the team found.\n\nBased on a statistical model, the researchers propose that both people had a grandparent with African ancestry, possibly from similar groups that left sub-Saharan Africa between the mid-sixth and early seventh centuries.\n\nThe fact that these individuals were buried with their communities suggests they were valued by their peers, the authors wrote in the study.\n\nThe Updown girl was buried with a knife, a spoon, a bone comb near her left hip, and a decorated pot from Frankish Gaul at her feet. DNA analysis also revealed that she had biological relatives in the same cemetery. The Worth Matravers young man, on the other hand, was buried in a double grave with an older man he was not biologically related to.\n\n, a bioarchaeologist at McMaster University in Ontario who was not involved in the studies, told Live Science in an email that the researchers \"do a good job of discussing the historical evidence for trade between parts of Africa and northern countries.\"\n\nGiven previous discoveries of diverse individuals dating back to the Roman Empire \u2014 including the found in York, who may have had North African ancestry \u2014 \"the presence of these individuals at Updown and Worth Matravers in 7th century Britain isn't terribly surprising,\" Prowse said.\n\nBut Sayer does not think there is continuity between the Roman period people with African ancestry and the seventh-century people found in southern Britain. After the Germanic sacked Rome in A.D. 455, they founded a kingdom in North Africa. But then the conquered them in A.D. 534.\n\n\"At the end of the Roman period, North Africa was conquered by the Vandals,\" Sayer said. \"It is the reconquest in the middle sixth century AD \u2014 around 533 to 535 \u2014 which seems to be the significant event here.\"\n\nThe DNA data showing African ancestry is \"unexpected but congruent\" with archaeological and historical evidence, the researchers wrote in the study, and is shedding new light on the early medieval period in Britain.\n\nRoman Britain quiz: What do you know about the Empire's conquest of the British Isles?",

      "text": "Abstract\nThe history of the British Isles and Ireland is characterized by multiple periods of major cultural change, including the influential transformation after the end of Roman rule, which precipitated shifts in language, settlement patterns and material culture1. The extent to which migration from continental Europe mediated these transitions is a matter of long-standing debate2,3,4. Here we study genome-wide ancient DNA from 460 medieval northwestern Europeans\u2014including 278 individuals from England\u2014alongside archaeological data, to infer contemporary population dynamics. We identify a substantial increase of continental northern European ancestry in early medieval England, which is closely related to the early medieval and present-day inhabitants of Germany and Denmark, implying large-scale substantial migration across the North Sea into Britain during the Early Middle Ages. As a result, the individuals who we analysed from eastern England derived up to 76% of their ancestry from the continental North Sea zone, albeit with substantial regional variation and heterogeneity within sites. We show that women with immigrant ancestry were more often furnished with grave goods than women with local ancestry, whereas men with weapons were as likely not to be of immigrant ancestry. A comparison with present-day Britain indicates that subsequent demographic events reduced the fraction of continental northern European ancestry while introducing further ancestry components into the English gene pool, including substantial southwestern European ancestry most closely related to that seen in Iron Age France5,6.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nMain\nThe first millennium ce saw major demographic, cultural and political change in Europe, including the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, migration and the emergence of medieval institutions that shaped the modern world. The post-Roman transformation of lowland Britain was particularly profound. The end of the Roman administration in fifth century Britain preceded a dramatic shift in material culture, architecture, manufacturing and agricultural practice, and was accompanied by language change1. The archaeological record and place names indicate shared cultural features across the North Sea zone, in particular, along the east and southeast coasts of present-day England, Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony (Germany), Frisia (Netherlands) and the Jutland peninsula (Denmark)2,3,4. Examples include the appearance of Grubenh\u00e4user (sunken feature buildings), large cremation cemeteries and the styles of cremation urns or objects that used animal art and chip-carved metal7,8,9,10,11. Moreover, wrist clasps, as well as cruciform and square-headed brooches, found in sixth and seventh century Britain had attested southern Scandinavian origins12,13. Despite these similarities across the North Sea zone, there was also insular material culture that had no continental equivalent14,15. Adding to this, some places and geographical features such as rivers retained names of Celtic or late Latin origin16,17.\nFrom the Renaissance to the present day, the primary explanatory narrative for these changes has been invasion and conquest followed by resettlement from the continent18. On the basis of a small set of written sources, it was supposed that the local Romano-British population was largely replaced by migrants from the Germanic-speaking part of the continent. However, the extent to which these traditional cultural historical interpretations explain patterns of material culture or agree with the historical accounts has been questioned18. For example, historical sources going back to Bede (writing in the eight century) indicated Jutes as settlers in Kent. But, in an issue that became known as \u2018the problem of the Jutes\u201919,20,21, this historically attested migration is difficult to determine from or reconcile with the archaeological record. Indeed, material culture elements found in Kent resemble those of contemporary Merovingian France and Alemannic (southern) Germany, rather than the rest of England or Denmark. Such discrepancies between the archaeological record and historical narratives could be argued to support a rejection of migration or invasion hypotheses, and this was the preferred theoretical position of many archaeologists from the 1960s onwards1,18,22. By that time, many scholars favoured a model of elite dominance involving small, mobile warbands and the acculturation of the local British population. However, the available isotopic and DNA evidence, even if hitherto small scale, suggests that immigrants were less wealthy and buried alongside locals23,24,25,26,27,28, which does not fit a model of elite influence that could explain the adoption of a West Germanic language with apparently minimal influence from Celtic or Latin29,30,31,32.\nThere is a history of addressing these questions using genetic data. After early attempts to use ancient genetic data failed33, researchers turned to studies based on present-day populations and uniparentally inherited markers, but still without reaching consensus. Work based on present-day Y chromosomes inferred 50\u2013100% replacement of male lineages during the Early Middle Ages in eastern England34,35. More recently, the first genome-wide study of present-day British people concluded that immigrant continental northern European ancestry makes up less than 50% of the present-day southeastern English gene pool36. However, populations change over time through drift and gene flow, so present-day populations may be poor proxies for ancient groups of unknown genetic makeup. The feasibility of ancient DNA analyses to inform on population history in Britain was first demonstrated with the report of genome-wide ancient DNA (aDNA) data26,37 from 20 individuals from the Iron Age to the Early Middle Ages, two studies that have provided unambiguous evidence for continental ancestry in early and middle Anglo-Saxon contexts.\nHere we investigate early medieval population dynamics in England and across the North Sea zone with the first large-scale genome-wide study of aDNA in this time period and region, increasing the archaeogenetic record in England specifically, from 8 to 285 individuals. We target a comprehensive time transect of sites in the south and east of England, spanning predominantly the time period 450\u2013850 ce, starting with early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries including Apple Down, Dover Buckland, Eastry, Ely, Hatherdene Close, Lakenheath, Oakington, Polhill and West Heslerton. This allows us to address questions concerning the extent of continental migration to England, and its effect on the local insular gene pool. In addition, the association of artefacts with individuals allows us to study the dynamics of the migration process at the community level.\nNew aDNA data\nWe sampled skeletal remains from 494 ancient northwestern Europeans from 37 different sites in England, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, dated between approximately 200 and 1300 ce (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Table 1). We prepared powder from skeletal material, extracted aDNA and converted it into double-stranded or single-stranded libraries (Methods). We selected 439 libraries for hybridization DNA capture to enrich for sequences that overlapped 1.24 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For 40 libraries, we generated complete genomes without capture, with a mean coverage of 0.9\u00d7.\nAfter quality filtering (Methods) and exclusion of duplicate individuals, genome-wide data for 460 individuals were available for analysis. These include 278 ancient individuals from England, and 182 individuals from neighbouring ancient populations in Ireland and the European continent (Fig. 1). We combined our newly reported data with published aDNA from 4,336 individuals (Supplementary Note 2), including 1,098 post-Neolithic genomes from northwestern Europe26,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44. We also compiled a reference dataset of 10,176 present-day European individuals36,45,46,47 genotyped on an intersection of 445,171 SNPs (Supplementary Note 2). To aid interpretation of our genetic data, we also radiocarbon-dated 57 samples selected on the basis of ancestry composition, burial assemblage and preservation.\nPopulation shifts in post-Roman England\nWe performed principal component analysis (PCA) on 5,365 present-day northwestern Europeans, from Ireland to Sweden, and projected our ancient genomes onto this genetic variation (Fig. 2). For present-day variation, PC1 and PC2 broadly reflect geography, forming a V-shaped pattern from Scandinavians via individuals from northern Germany and the Netherlands towards those from Britain and Ireland. We highlight the position of individuals from present-day England (Fig. 2a), which follow a clinal distribution defined by the western British and Irish (WBI; which includes Irish, Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh) at one extreme and overlapping present-day Dutch at the other extreme. The ancient genomes fall onto a slightly separate cline, with most of the early medieval individuals from Dutch, German and Danish sites plotting on top of present-day continental northern Europeans (CNEs; northern Germans and Danish), whereas Bronze and Iron Age individuals from Britain and Ireland cluster together with WBI (Fig. 2b). Of note, in contrast to the preceding Bronze and Iron Age individuals from Britain and Ireland, the majority of the early medieval samples from England (England EMA) plot together with the ancient individuals from the continental North Sea area along with the present-day CNEs. The divergence between prehistoric and early medieval individuals from England is also seen in the distribution of genetic distances (FST) as well as shared alleles (F4) on both the population (Extended Data Fig. 1) and the individual scale (Supplementary Fig. 3.3). We notice that the individuals from early medieval English sites are distinctly heterogeneous in the first two PCs and cover the full extent of the cline between the Bronze and Iron Age cluster and the early medieval cluster.\nThese genetic patterns suggest that early medieval individuals from England have variable amounts of CNE ancestry. Although most individuals from early medieval English sites cluster clearly with either present-day WBI samples or CNEs, many individuals fall between these two clusters, suggesting admixture between these ancestral groups. To quantitatively estimate these ancestry compositions, we decomposed ancestral sources using a supervised clustering approach implemented in the software ADMIXTURE48. Specifically, we assembled modern populations into two metapopulations that serve as proxies for the source ancestries in early medieval England defined above: CNE (n = 407) and WBI (n = 667). We confirmed that these two present-day metapopulations accurately represent the ancient admixture sources by testing their relationships to the ancient individuals from England using FST statistics and F4 statistics of the form F4(Yoruba, Test; WBI, CNE) (Extended Data Fig. 1 and 2). The resulting ancestry estimates for early medieval English individuals are indeed tightly congruent with both PCA PC1 position and F4 statistics (Pearson\u2019s |r| > 0.9 between PCA, F4 and ADMIXTURE ancestry assessments).\nApplying our CNE\u2013WBI ancestry decomposition to prehistoric samples, we found the genome-wide CNE ancestry in Britain and Ireland to be very low before the Early Middle Ages (Extended Data Fig. 3). In Bell Beaker and Bronze Age individuals from England, CNE ancestry does not account for more than 1% (Fig. 3a). This cannot be explained by genetic drift due to the temporal gap between our present-day CNE proxy and the Bronze Age, as shown by F4 statistics (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2), which are robust against such drift. Similar proportions were also measured during the Iron Age (1% on average). CNE ancestry increased only during the Roman period, to 15% on average, although this estimate is based on only seven individuals. Six of those seven Roman-era individuals are from a single site, Eboracum (present-day York); which was a Colonia, the highest rank of Roman city with a legionary fortress, and as such it may have attracted a more cosmopolitan population than most of the rest of England (Fig. 3b).\nIn contrast to these previous periods, the majority of the early medieval individuals from England in our sample derive either all or a large fraction of their ancestry from continental northern Europe, with CNE ancestry of 76 \u00b1 2% on average (Methods). Although CNE ancestry is predominant in central and eastern England, it is much less prevalent in the south and southwest of England, and absent in the one site that we analysed from Ireland (Fig. 3b). Moreover, we observed differences in continental ancestry not only between but also within sites. Although we estimate CNE ancestry to be prevalent across eastern English cemeteries, there was considerable variation at the individual level, ranging from 0% to 100% of CNE ancestry within a site. For example, at Hatherdene Close (n = 17) in Cambridgeshire, we estimated a mean CNE ancestry of approximately 70%, with eight individuals exhibiting exclusively CNE ancestry, but three individuals having low or zero CNE ancestry. Overall, these patterns of genetic heterogeneity, from the transregional to the family level, are consistent with continuous interaction between the Iron Age-derived Romano-British population and migrants from the continent.\nWe find no significant differences of CNE or WBI ancestry between male and female individuals (Supplementary Note 7), and find individuals of both ancestries within prominent and/or furnished burials. In England overall, individuals with CNE ancestry (here and in the following, CNE means more than 50% CNE, and WBI means less than 50% CNE) are more likely to be found with grave goods than individuals with WBI ancestry (Fisher\u2019s exact test P = 0.016). Of note, this appears to be driven by female individuals with CNE ancestry who are more likely to be found with grave goods (P = 0.001), and in particular brooches (P = 0.012), than female individuals with WBI ancestry (both based on Fisher\u2019s exact test). However, graves belonging to male individuals with CNE ancestry are just as likely to have grave goods (P = 0.57) or weapons (P = 1) as those with WBI ancestry (both based on Fisher\u2019s exact test). This is underlined by specific examples, such as a near 100% WBI male burial in grave 37 at Updown Eastry found with a seax under a barrow marked by a ring ditch, indicating a prominent weapon burial associated with a prominent person or status (Supplementary Fig. 1.1).\nThis pattern is also visible in East Anglia specifically, where individuals with CNE ancestry more often have grave goods (P = 0.014). This is also significant when considering only female individuals (P = 0.025), but not when considering females with brooches, which display gender-related status (P = 0.197). At the site level, these patterns are partly significant at Hatherdene Close (P = 0.015, 0.036 and 0.1, respectively). Treating ancestry not as a binary but as a continuous variable largely agrees with the previous results (see Supplementary Note 7), with a notable exception of West Heslerton, which stands out from this overall pattern, where men with a greater proportion of CNE ancestry are more likely to be found with weapons (Wilcoxon rank sum P = 0.02, although non-significant with Fisher\u2019s exact test P = 0.53), which is the only significant signal of this type that we found (Lakenheath also displays many CNE burials with weapons, but with limited sample size).\nThere are notable individual exceptions to these patterns, such as a predominantly (60%) WBI burial at grave 80 in Oakington, found with the skeleton of a cow, silvered disc brooches and a chatelaine, and interred under a barrow, which is one of the more notable or wealthy burials in this cemetery49 (Supplementary Fig. 1.4). We note that several burials with weapons that were previously identified as female and discussed in the literature23,50 have turned out to be genetically male in our analysis (see the highlighted entries in Supplementary Table 1). Of note, however, a single individual still displays a sex\u2013gender difference: a teenage boy buried with an equal-arm brooch, beads and a knife (grave 122 in West Heslerton).\nIn Dover Buckland, one of the most comprehensively sampled cemeteries in our dataset, we observed the mixing of genetic and cultural identities at the family level. For example, we found a group of relatives, spanning at least three generations, who all exhibit unadmixed CNE ancestry (Extended Data Fig. 4a,c). Down the pedigree, we then see the integration of a female into this group, who herself had unadmixed WBI ancestry (grave 304), and two daughters (graves 290 and 426), consequently of mixed ancestry. WBI ancestry entered again one generation later, as visible in near 50:50 mixed-ancestry grandchildren (graves 414, 305 and 425). Grave goods, including brooches and weapons, are in fact found on both sides of this family tree, pre-mixing and post-mixing (for example, in the youngest and mixed generation, we found both weapons, beads and pin, and their mother with a brooch). Although the first mixed generation is buried in close proximity to each other, the grandchildren are elsewhere on the site, although placed together (Extended Data Fig. 4b).\nA quite different pattern is observed at Apple Down, which is among the most western sites that we have analysed. Here graves can be classified into distinct burial configurations according to orientation, location and frequency of artefacts. We found that burials with CNE ancestry are more often buried in configuration A (located towards the middle of the site and with east\u2013west burial orientation) than in configuration B (located more towards the edges and with north\u2013south orientation)49 (Fisher\u2019s exact test P = 0.048). This shows that there is a significant difference within the treatment of individuals according to their ancestry, a finding very similar to those at early medieval cemeteries in Hungary and Italy with respect to northern versus southern European ancestry51.\nAncestry sources across the North Sea\nOur new continental medieval data from regions bordering the North Sea provide a unique opportunity to further investigate the potential source of the CNE-related ancestry increase that we have described above (Supplementary Note 3). To this end, we first selected individuals who, according to our CNE\u2013WBI decomposition, are of unadmixed CNE ancestry (CNE of more than 95%; from here from as England EMA CNE). For each site in the continental dataset, we then tested whether its individuals were genetically similar to the England EMA CNE group (n = 109) in terms of allele frequencies. Among the continental medieval groups analysed, sites from both northern Germany and Denmark are indeed indistinguishable from England EMA CNE individuals (Fig. 4). Consistently, England EMA CNE and medieval individuals from Lower Saxony exhibit almost identical genetic affinities and ancestry components (Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 3.2), possess the highest level of genetic similarity (based on F2, F3, F4 and FST statistics) (Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 3.8) and are symmetrically related to most ancient and modern populations (Supplementary Table 3.12). Together, this suggests that they are likely derived from the same source population. Using the LOCATOR52 software, which uses machine learning to map individuals into geographical space based on their genetic profiles, we infer a region spanning the northern Netherlands to the southernmost tip of Sweden as a putative source for the England EMA CNE ancestors, with a large proportion of individuals being assigned to Lower Saxony (see Methods) (Fig. 4). This similarity adds to previous evidence from the material culture and burial practices, especially between the Elbe-Weser region and the early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, from which the archaeological migration discourse initially arose53. However, we also note the strong genetic homogeneity among most analysed sites in the northern Netherlands, northern Germany and Denmark (Supplementary Note 4), implying that, during the Early Middle Ages, the continental North Sea and adjacent western Baltic Sea area was a genetic continuum spanning most of the western North European plain without major geographical substructure (Supplementary Fig. 4.1,4.4). This, together with genetic backflow from the British\u2013Irish Isles into continental Europe (Supplementary Table 4.2 and Supplementary Fig. 4.2,4.4), reflects the inferred linguistic history54 and precludes further identification of specific microregions that contributed gene flow to Britain. We note that, although our screening of plausible medieval continental sites is broad, it could overemphasize later developments of the genetic structure due to the increased replacement of cremation burials by inhumations on the continent. It also has a specific caveat in Scandinavia, where our medieval reference populations are mostly from Viking-era burials, which have diverse and mixed ancestries that may not be representative of the earlier populations there42,44.\nAlready during the Early Middle Ages, several individuals from multiple sites exhibit modest degrees of excess affinity (5.4%) to present-day individuals from the Scandinavian peninsula (Supplementary Fig. 6.2a), indicating additional sources. Although close cultural contacts to the Scandinavian peninsula are attested in the archaeological record3, we did not find this genetic variation to be geographically stratified within early medieval England (Supplementary Fig. 6.2b). This Scandinavian Peninsula-related ancestry increases substantially (to 30.6%) only during the Viking period (Supplementary Note 6).\nHaving established the close relatedness between specific continental regions and the individuals from early medieval England, we modelled the latter more directly using ancient source populations with the method qpAdm35. Specifically, we pooled ancient individuals in England by site and modelled each group as being admixed between two sources: one represented by pooled Iron Age/Roman period individuals from England, and the other represented by pooled early medieval individuals from Lower Saxony (from here known as LowerSaxony EMA). The resulting admixture proportions obtained in this way for early medieval sites in England are strongly correlated with our mean estimates from supervised ADMIXTURE above, as well as site-wise F4 statistics and mean PCA position (Pearson\u2019s |r| > 0.9 between all four ancestry assessments) (Extended Data Fig. 6).\nUsing this model, we detected an average of 86 \u00b1 2% ancestry from Lower Saxony across all early medieval sites in England, only slightly higher than the 76 \u00b1 2% estimated using present-day source populations and supervised ADMIXTURE. At a regional scale, we observed more ancestry from Lower Saxony in eastern England than in the southwest, consistent with ancestry arriving from the east, either in one event or over a continuous time period. Our estimate of genome-wide ancestry is supported by independent evidence for population turnover from uniparental markers (Supplementary Fig. 2.7). Before the Middle Ages, post-Neolithic individuals from Britain and Ireland carried overwhelmingly the major Y chromosomal haplogroup R1b-P312, especially the sub-haplogroup R-L21 (refs. 39,41), which in present day shows a cline across the region, with highest frequencies in the west55,56. By contrast, the early medieval population of England exhibits a substantial fraction of continental-derived haplotypes belonging to haplogroups R1b-U106, R1a-M420, I2a1-L460 and I1-M253, which are commonly found in northern and central Europe (and are also common among ancient continental individuals including the ones that we report). In particular, Y chromosomal haplogroups I1-M253 and R1a-M420 were absent from our Bronze, Iron and Roman Age British and Irish individuals, but were identified in more than one-third of our individuals from early medieval England. Overall, haplogroups absent in Bronze and Iron Age England represent at least 73 \u00b1 4% of the Y chromosomes in our early medieval English sample, mirroring the turnover estimates from autosomal data. Similarly, mitochondrial genomes show evidence of female lineage population turnover from regions bordering the North Sea (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2.4).\nEstimates of continental ancestry on the X chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. 2.11), as well as estimates of source origin of Y chromosomal haplogroups (Supplementary Fig. 2.16) point to no significant difference between male-specific lineages and autosomal admixture estimates (Supplementary Note 2). Although neither mitochondrial, Y chromosomal or X chromosomal data can exclude subtle levels of sex bias during the admixture (Supplementary Note 2), they are also consistent with a model of no sex bias, suggesting that the migrants included both men and women who mixed at similar levels with the local population. We note that absence of sex bias during the early medieval CNE\u2013WBI admixture does not exclude possibilities for sex bias in the later admixture processes that caused the dilution of CNE ancestry in present-day England observed below.\nRecent population shifts in England\nAlthough the most prominent signal of admixture in early medieval England is the rise in ancestry related to medieval and modern continental northern Europe, we found that several English sites include genomes that could not be explained as products of admixture between the two hypothesized ancestral gene pools\u2014England IA or LowerSaxony EMA\u2014using qpAdm57. Instead, these genomes have additional continental western and southern European ancestry (Supplementary Note 5). This ancestry is genetically very similar to Iron Age genomes from France5,6 (France IA) (Extended Data Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 5.1 and Supplementary Fig. 5.3,5.4). The majority of this French Iron Age-derived ancestry is found in early medieval southeastern England, namely, at the sites of Apple Down, Eastry, Dover Buckland and Rookery Hill, where it constitutes up to 51% of the ancestry identified (Extended Data Fig. 8a and Supplementary Table 5.4).\nThe appearance of France IA-related ancestry in early medieval England anticipates a pattern that we also clearly see in the present-day English population structure, in which we found that the same two-way CNE\u2013WBI model that fits most ancient English fails for the modern population (Supplementary Fig. 5.8,5.11). Indeed, the missing component in the modern English population appears to be represented well by France IA (Supplementary Table 5.2 and Supplementary Fig. 5.2).\nUsing qpAdm (Methods), most present-day Scottish, Welsh and Irish genomes can be modelled as receiving most or all of their ancestry from the British Bronze or Iron Age reference groups, with little or no continental contribution. By contrast, for all present-day English samples the simple two-way admixture model (England LIA + England EMA CNE) fails. By extending our model to a three-way with added France IA as a third component, we now obtain fitting models (Supplementary Fig. 5.11,5.21). We estimate that the ancestry of the present-day English ranges between 25% and 47% England EMA CNE-like, 11% and 57% England LIA-like and 14% and 43% France IA-like. There are substantial genetic differences between English regions (Fig. 5a), with less ancient continental ancestry (England EMA CNE or France IA related) evident in southwestern and northwestern England as well as along the Welsh borders (Fig. 5c). By contrast, we saw peaks in CNE-like ancestry of up to 47% for southeastern, eastern and central England, especially Sussex, the East Midlands and East Anglia. We found substantial France IA ancestry only in England, but not in Wales, Scotland or Ireland, following an east-to-west cline in Britain (Pearson\u2019s |r| > 0.86), accounting for as much as 43% of the ancestry in East Anglia (Fig. 5d). Very similar results were produced using LowerSaxony EMA as a source for CNE ancestry (Extended Data Fig. 8b). One potential caveat in this analysis is our relatively sparse Roman sample from England, where we particularly lack samples from the south, which might have pre-existing France IA-related ancestry. We, therefore, turned to one of our early medieval sites, the post-Roman cemetery of Worth Matravers at the southern coast of Dorset, whose individuals have nearly no CNE ancestry (less than 6% on average), and thus may serve as a more temporally close proxy for post-Roman Britain before the arrival of CNEs. When used as a source in our model, we found that the estimates of France IA-related ancestry in present-day England changed by less than 3% on average across the regions (Fig. 5b), suggesting that France IA-related ancestry entered England to a substantial amount after the Roman period. We note that a model involving southern or western European-like ancestry in England has been previously proposed36 on the basis of present-day samples, but we can now go further and delineate this third component more clearly against the CNE-like immigrant gene pool making up the majority of the early medieval individuals from England that we studied.\nOur three-way population model for present-day England supports a view of post-Roman English genetic history as punctuated by gene flow processes from at least two major sources: first, the attested arrival of CNE ancestry during the Early Middle Ages from northern Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, and second, the arrival of ancestry related to France IA. Although we cannot precisely date the order of those arrivals, at least substantial amounts of France IA-related ancestry seem to be absent in northern and eastern England during the Early Middle Ages and therefore must have arrived there subsequently. In other parts of England, however, it may have entered together with CNE ancestry or even earlier. Notably in southern England, namely, Eastry, Apple Down and Rookery Hill, several early medieval individuals already exhibit France IA-related ancestry, which probably results, at least in part, from localized mobility between the south of England and the Frankish areas of Europe during the Early Middle Ages (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Indeed, Frankish material culture is evident in these regions, particularly in Kent and Sussex58,59,60. Admixture from this second source is, therefore, unlikely to have resulted from a single discrete wave. More plausibly, it resulted from pulses of immigration or continuous gene flow between eastern England and its neighbouring regions.\nDiscussion\nThe \u2018Anglo-Saxon settlement\u2019 is among the most intensely debated topics in British history, but much of the discussion remains anchored to the contents of Bede\u2019s Ecclesiastical History and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle18. These early writings defined the settlement as a single event, or a series of events, tied to the immediate aftermath of the Roman administration in the fifth to sixth century. In the archaeological and historical debate, this has been described as happening to varying degrees; as the Adventus Saxonum (a folk migration of named Germanic tribes), an invasion or the movement of a limited number of elite male migrants18,61. To this day, little agreement has been reached over the scale of migration, the mode of interaction between locals and newcomers, or how the transformation of the social, material, and linguistic or religious spheres was achieved. Here we provide strong evidence of large-scale early medieval migration across the North Sea zone and extend its temporal scope. In particular, we show that these migrations started earlier than previously assumed, as evidenced by individuals with CNE ancestry from later Roman contexts, and continued throughout the middle Anglo-Saxon period. Our results from middle Saxon sites such as Sedgeford push the estimated dates of arrival of CNE ancestry to as late as the eight century and merge these events with interpersonal mobility from Sweden and other Scandinavian regions during the later Viking invasion and settlement. Together, these migrations appear to be part of a continuous movement of people from across the North Sea to Britain from the later Roman period into the eleventh century ce.\nOur results overwhelmingly support the view that the formation of early medieval society in England was not simply the result of a small elite migration18,61, but that mass migration from afar must also have had a substantial role. We identified numerous individuals with only continental ancestry, suggesting that many of them were migrants themselves or were their unadmixed descendants. Both the lack of genetic evidence for male sex bias, and the correlation between ancestry and archaeological features, point to women being an important factor in this migration. Although men with migrant and local ancestry were buried in similar ways, women with migrant ancestries were more often found with grave goods than women with local ancestry. This could point to social stratification, or plausibly might simply reflect the degree to which women of local ancestry were integrated into the emerging CNE families. It is clear, however, that these social differences are subtle, given that we did not find evidence for this pattern in male burials, and that we found significant regional and site-level differences. Previous hypotheses about the social mechanisms in this migration have included partial social segregation62, elite migration18,61, substantial population replacement34 or no migration at all1,22. Our combined genetic and archaeological analysis point to a complex, regionally contingent migration with partial integration that was probably dependent on the fortunes of specific families and their individual members.\nIn present-day Britain, we saw substantial northern continental ancestry, albeit at a lower level than during the early medieval period, pointing to a lasting demographic impact of the \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 migrations. Specifically, in early medieval western England, Wales and Scotland, and more generally in England during the Norman period, further aDNA sampling may clarify how CNE ancestry spread and was subsequently diluted. Beyond the substantial early medieval immigration of northwestern continental European people found here, we have also identified a second major source of continental ancestry in modern Britain from sources more to the European south and west. This second ancestry component is already evident in our early medieval samples. In Southeast England specifically, individuals at several sites show ancestry whose closest match is in modern-day western Germany, Belgium and/or France, which matches the Frankish connections seen in the archaeological record for these regions. Our data and analyses indicate that this second genetic introgression continued further into the Middle Ages and potentially beyond.\nMethods\nStudy design\nArchaeological research\nProvenance information for samples from all archaeological sites are given in Supplementary Information Section 1, together with short descriptions of each site, the institution owning the samples (or custodians of the samples), the responsible coauthor who obtained permission to analyse and the year of the permission granted.\nSampling\nSampling of 494 bone and teeth samples took place in clean-room facilities dedicated to aDNA work, for 296 samples at the Max Planck Institute for Science of Human History in Jena (MPI-SHH), for 65 at the Department of Biological and Geographical Sciences at the University of Huddersfield, for 33 at the Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School (HMS), for 32 at the Institute for Scientific Archaeology of the Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen, for 31 at the Leiden University Medical Centre in Leiden, for 15 at the Globe Institute of the University of Copenhagen, for 12 at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide, and for 10 at the Research Laboratory for Archaeology, University of Oxford. The sampling workflow included documenting and photographing the provided samples. For teeth processed at the MPI-SHH, we cut along the cementum\u2013enamel junction and collected powder by drilling into the pulp chamber. The teeth processed at the Leiden University Medical Centre were sampled according to a previously published paper63. For the petrous bones, we either cut the petrous pyramid longitudinally to drill the dense part directly from either side64 or applied the cranial base drilling method as previously described65. We collected between 30 and 200 mg of bone or tooth powder per sample for DNA extractions.\nDNA extraction\nAt MPI-SHH and HMS, aDNA was extracted following a modified protocol66, as described in www.protocols.io/view/ancient-dna-extraction-from-skeletal-material-baksicwe, in which we replaced the extended-MinElute-column assembly for manual extractions with columns from the Roche High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit67, and for automated extraction with a protocol that replaced spin columns with silica beads in the purification step68. Extraction of aDNA at the Leiden University Medical Centre, at the Globe Institute and at the University of Adelaide followed the protocols of Kootker et al.63, Damgaard et al.69 and Brotherton et al.70, respectively. Extraction of aDNA at the Universities of Oxford and Huddersfield followed a published protocol71.\nLibrary construction\nWe generated 104 double-indexed72 double-stranded libraries using 25 \u00b5l of DNA extract and following established protocols73. We applied the partial UDG (UDG half)74 protocol to remove most of the aDNA damage while preserving the characteristic damage pattern in the terminal nucleotides. For 375 extracts, we generated double-indexed single-stranded libraries75 using 20 \u00b5l of DNA extract and applied no UDG treatment.\nShotgun screening, capture and sequencing\nLibraries produced at MPI-SHH were sequenced in-house on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform to an average depth of 5 million reads and after demultiplexing processed through EAGER76. After an initial quality filter based on the presence of aDNA damage and endogenous DNA higher than 0.1%, we subsequently enriched 439 libraries using in-solution capture probes synthesized by Agilent Technologies for approximately 1240K SNPs along the nuclear genome77. The captured libraries were sequenced for 20\u201340 million reads on average using either a single end (1 \u00d7 75 bp reads) or paired-end configuration (2 \u00d7 50 bp reads). In addition, 40 genomes were shotgun sequenced for 225 million reads on average to low coverage. For the 120 samples processed at HMS, we enriched for sequences overlapping approximately 1240K SNPs77 as well as the mitochondrial genome78, and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq500 instruments for 2 \u00d7 76 cycles, or on HiseqX10 instruments for 2 \u00d7 101 cycles (reading out both indices) approximately until the point in which every additional 100 sequences generated yielded fewer than one additional SNP with data.\naDNA data processing\nRead processing and aDNA damage\nFor data produced at the MPI-SHH, after demultiplexing based on a unique pair of indexes, raw sequence data were processed using EAGER76. This included clipping sequencing adaptors from reads with AdapterRemoval (v2.3.1)79 and mapping of reads with Burrows\u2013Wheeler Aligner (BWA)80 v0.7.12 against the human reference genome hg19, with seed length (-l) disabled, maximum number of differences (-n) of 0.01 and a quality filter (-q) of 30. We removed duplicate reads with the same orientation and start and end positions using DeDup76 v0.12.2. Terminal base deamination damage calculation was done using mapDamage81 v2.0.6, specifying a length (-l) of 100 bp. For the 107 libraries that underwent UDG half treatment, we used BamUtil v1.0.14 (https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BamUtil:_trimBam) to clip two bases at the start and end of all reads for each sample to remove residual deaminations, thus removing genotyping errors that could arise due to aDNA damage.\nFor data produced at the HMS, after trimming barcodes and adapters57, we merged read pairs with at least 15 bp of overlap, allowing no more than one mismatch if base quality was at least 20, or up to three mismatches if base qualities were less than 20. We chose the nucleotide of the higher quality in case of a conflict while setting the local base quality to the minimum of the two using a custom toolkit (https://github.com/DReichLab/ADNA-Tools). We aligned merged sequences to human genome hg19 using BWA80 v0.7.15 with a maximum number of differences (-n) of 0.01, a maximum number of gap opens (-o) of 2 and seed length (-l) of 16,500. PCR duplicates were identified by tagging all aligned sequences with the same start and stop positions and orientation and, in some cases, in-line barcodes using Picard MarkDuplicates (http://broadinstitute.Github.io/picard/). We only considered sequences that spanned at least 30 bp, and subsequently selected a single copy of each such sequence that had the highest base-quality score. To remove aDNA damage, we trimmed the last two bases of each sequence for UDG-treated libraries and the last five for non-UDG-treated libraries.\nSex determination\nTo determine the genetic sex of ancient individuals processed at the MPI-SHH, we calculated the coverage on the autosomes as well as on each sex chromosome and subsequently normalized the X reads and Y reads by the autosomal coverage82. For that, we used a custom script (https://github.com/TCLamnidis/Sex.DetERRmine) for the calculation of each relative coverage as well as their associated error bars83. Female individuals were expected to have an X rate of 1 and a Y rate of 0, whereas male individuals were expected to have a rate of 0.5 for both X and Y chromosomes. For individuals processed at the HMS, we calculated the ratio of sequences mapping to the Y chromosome to the sum of sequences mapping to the X and Y chromosome for the 1240K data. A ratio less than 3% is consistent with a female individual and a ratio higher than 35% is consistent with a male individual6.\nContamination estimation\nWe used the Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data (ANGSD) package84 (v0.923) to test for heterozygosity of polymorphic sites on the X chromosome in male individuals, applying a contamination threshold of 5% at the results of method two. For male and female samples, we estimated contamination levels on the mitochondrial DNA either using Schmutzi85 (v1.5.4) by comparing the consensus mitogenome of the ancient sample to a panel of 197 worldwide mitogenomes as a potential contamination source (MPI-SHH), or by estimating the match rate to the consensus sequence using contamMix86 v1.0-12 (HMS), applying a contamination threshold of 5%. We used PMDtools87 (v0.50) to isolate sequences from each sample that had clear evidence of contamination (over 5% on the X chromosome or mitogenome) according to the post-mortem damage score (PMD score > 3, using only bases with phred-scaled quality of at least 30 to compute the score), and performed contamination estimation again. If a sample scored below the threshold, it was included in the analysis and modelling. If the authenticity of a sample could not be verified or falsified, it was included in population genetic analyses but not used for modelling. In summary, the median mitochondrial DNA contamination is 1.0%, and the median X chromosome contamination is 1.1% (after PMD filtering).\nGenotyping\nWe used the program pileupCaller (v1.4.0.2) (https://github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools.git) to genotype the trimmed BAM files of UDG half libraries. A pileup file was generated using samtools mpileup with parameters -q 30 -Q 30 -B containing only sites overlapping with our capture panel. From this file, for each individual and each SNP on the 1240K panel57,88,89, one read covering the SNP was drawn at random, and a pseudohaploid call was made, that is, the ancient individual was assumed homozygous for the allele on the randomly drawn read for the SNP in question. For libraries that underwent no UDG treatment, we used the parameter -SingleStrandMode, which causes pileupCaller to ignore reads aligning to the forward strand at C/T polymorphisms and at G/A polymorphisms to ignore reads aligning to the reverse strand, which should remove post-mortem damage in aDNA libraries prepared with the non-UDG single-stranded protocol.\nMitochondrial and Y chromosome haplogroup assignment\nTo process mitochondrial DNA data generated at the MPI-SHH, we extracted reads from 1240K data using samtools90 v1.3.1 and mapped these to the revised Cambridge reference sequence. At the HMS, we aligned merged sequences to the mitochondrial genome RSRS91. We subsequently called consensus sequences using Geneious92 R9.8.1 and used HaploGrep 2 (ref. 93) v2.4.0 (https://haplogrep.uibk.ac.at/; with PhyloTree version 17-FU1) to determine mitochondrial haplotypes. For the male individuals processed at the MPI-SHH, we used pileup from the Rsamtools package to call the Y chromosome SNPs of the 1240K SNP panel (mapping quality of 30 or more and base quality of 30 or more). We then manually assigned Y chromosome haplogroups using pileups of Y SNPs included in the 1240K panel that overlap with SNPs included on the ISOGG SNP index v.15.73 (Y-DNA Haplogroup Tree 2019\u20132020; 2020.07.11). For male individuals processed at the HMS, we automatically determined Y chromosome haplogroups using both targeted SNPs and off-target sequences aligning to the Y chromosome based on comparisons to the Y chromosome phylogenetic tree from Yfull version 8.09 (https://www.yfull.com/)6.\nKinship estimation\nWe calculated the PWMR94 in all pairs of individuals from our pseudo-haploid dataset to double check for potential duplicate individuals and to determine first-degree, second-degree and third-degree relatives. For this purpose, we also used READ95 to determine first-degree, second-degree and third-degree relatedness among individuals based on the proportion of non-matching alleles (P0) in nonoverlapping windows of 1 Mb and to calculate standard errors. We also used the method LcMLkin96, which uses genotype likelihoods to estimate the three k-coefficients (k0, k1 or k2), which define the probability that two individuals have zero, one or two alleles identical by descendent at a random site in the genome. We performed LcMLkin to distinguish between possible parent\u2013offspring or sibling relationships.\nPopulation genetic analysis\nDataset\nWe merged our aDNA data with previously published datasets of 4,336 ancient individuals reported by the Reich laboratory in the Allen Ancient DNA Resource v.50.0 (https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data). We assembled a dataset from mostly European populations for genome-wide analyses36,45,46,47,97,98,99,100,101,102,103. This modern set includes 10,176 individuals (Supplementary Note 2). Loci and individuals with less than 95% call rate as well as a 15-Mb region surrounding the HLA region36 were removed and loci on three previously reported long-range linkage disequilibrium regions on chromosomes 6, 8 and 11 (refs. 104,105) were pruned using PLINK106 (v1.90b3.29). aDNA data were merged to this dataset, correcting for reference allele and strand flips. We kept 445,171 autosomal SNPs after intersecting autosomal SNPs in the 1240K capture with the modern analysis set.\nAbbreviations\nWe used the following abbreviations in population labels: N, Neolithic; C, Chalcolithic; EBA, Early Bronze Age; MBA, Middle Bronze Age; LBA, Late Bronze Age; Iron Age, IA; RA, Roman Age; EMA, Early Middle Ages; MA, Middle Ages. In Britain, these periods roughly correspond to the following simplified time ranges: Neolithic: 4000\u20132500 bce, Chalcolithic and EBA: 2500\u20131600 bce; MBA: 1600\u20131200 bce; LBA: 1200\u2013800 bce; IA: 800 bce to 400 ce; EMA 400\u20131000 ce.\nPCA\nWe carried out PCA using the smartpca software v16000 from the EIGENSOFT package (v6.0.1)107. We computed PCs on three different sets of modern European populations (Supplementary Note 2) and projected ancient individuals using lsqproject: YES.\nF statistics\nF3 and F4 statistics were computed with ADMIXTOOLS108 v3.0 (https://github.com/DReichLab). F3 statistics were calculated using qp3Pop (v435). For F4 statistics, we used the qpDstat (v755) and with the activated F4 mode. Significant deviation from zero can be interpreted as rejection of the tree population typology ((outgroup, X);(Pop1, Pop2)). Under the assumption that no gene flow occurred between Pop1 and Pop2 and the outgroup, a positive f-statistic suggests affinity between X and Pop2, whereas a negative value indicates affinity between X and Pop1. Standard errors were calculated with the default block jackknife 5 cM in size.\nFixation index\nWe calculated FST using smartpca software v16000 from the EIGENSOFT package (v6.0.1)107 with the fstonly, inbreed and fsthiprecision options set to YES.\nMaximum likelihood tree\nWe constructed maximum likelihood trees using TreeMix (v1.12)109. For each tree, we performed a round of global rearrangements after adding all populations (-global) and calculated 100 bootstrap replicates to assess the uncertainty of the fitted model (-bootstrap). Sample size correction was disabled.\nInference of mixture proportions\nWe estimated ancestry proportions using qpWave57,110 (v410) and qpAdm57 (v810) from ADMIXTOOLS108 v3.0 with the allsnps: YES option and a basic set of 11 outgroups: YRI.SG, Poland, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Wales, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands. For some analyses, we added additional outgroups to this basic set (Supplementary Notes 4\u20136).\nPrediction of geographical origins\nLOCATOR52 (v1.2) was run using a geolocated reference panel consisting of 670 Bronze Age, Iron Age and medieval European samples with 1X coverage higher than 50% and considering only polymorphisms covered at least in 50% of the samples, leaving a total of 920,060 SNPs. Default parameters were used, except that the width of each neural layer was 512 and -imputed-missing was set to YES. The best run was selected as the one showing the lowest validation error and the highest R2 numbers from a total of 40 independent runs.\nADMIXTURE analysis\nWe performed model-based clustering analysis using ADMIXTURE48 (v1.3). We used ADMIXTURE in supervised mode, in which we estimated admixture proportions for the ancient individuals using modern reference populations at various K values (Supplementary Notes 3\u20136). These analyses were run on haploid data with the parameter \u2013haploid set to all (=\"*\"). Standard errors for point estimates were calculated using 1,000 bootstrap replicates with the -B parameter. To obtain point estimates for populations, we averaged individual point estimates and calculated the standard error of the mean (s.e.m.): s.e.m. = \\(\\frac{\\sigma }{\\surd n}\\). We found that this better reflects the diversity within the population than a propagation of error approach, which underestimates the variance within the point estimate sample. For unsupervised ADMIXTURE analysis (Supplementary Notes 3 and 5), we carried out linkage disequilibrium pruning on the dataset using PLINK106 with the flag\u2013indep-pairwise 200 25 0.4, leaving 306,393 SNPs. We ran ADMIXTURE with the cross-validation (\u2013cv.) flag specifying from K = 2 to K = 10 clusters, with five replicates for each value of K. For each value of K, the replicate with highest log likelihood was kept.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nRaw sequence data (bam files) from the 479 newly reported ancient individuals will be available before publication from the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number PRJEB54899.

      "text": "What is DNA?\nLearn about what DNA is made of, how it works, who discovered it and other interesting DNA facts.\nDNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, and it's a molecule that supplies the genetic instructions that tell living creatures how to develop, live and reproduce. DNA can be found inside every cell and is passed down from parents to their offspring.\nWhat is DNA made of?\nDNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains three components: a phosphate group, which is one phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms; a sugar molecule; and a nitrogen base. The four types of nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) and cytosine (C), and together, these serve as the \"letters\" that make up the genetic code of our DNA.\nDNA has a structure called a double helix. Nucleotides are attached together to form two long strands that spiral to create this structure. If you think of the double-helix as a ladder, the phosphate and sugar molecules would be the sides, while the base pairs would be the rungs. The bases on one strand pair with the bases on another strand: Adenine pairs with thymine (A-T), and guanine pairs with cytosine (G-C).\nHuman DNA is made up of around 3 billion base pairs, and more than 99% of those bases are the same in all people, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM).\nRelated: How accurate are DNA tests?\nSimilar to the way that letters in the alphabet can be arranged to form words, the order of nitrogen bases in a DNA sequence forms genes, which, in the language of the cell, tell cells how to make proteins. The shorthand for this process is that genes \"encode\" proteins.\nBut DNA is not the direct template for protein production. To make a protein, the cell makes a copy of the gene, using not DNA but ribonucleic acid, or RNA. RNA shares a similar structure to DNA, except it contains only one strand, rather than two \u2014 so it looks like just one half of a ladder. In addition, while RNA has three of the four nitrogen bases in common with DNA, it uses a base called uracil rather than thymine to pair with adenine.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nAs a cell prepares to build a new protein, its DNA unzips to expose one strand of the gene with the instructions to build said protein. Then, an enzyme zooms in and constructs a new RNA molecule whose sequence mirrors that of the unzipped gene. This RNA copy, called messenger RNA (mRNA), tells the cell's protein-making machinery which amino acids to string together into a protein, according to \"Biochemistry\" (W. H. Freeman and Company, 2002).\nDNA molecules are long \u2014 so long, in fact, that they can't fit into cells without the right packaging. To fit inside cells, DNA is coiled tightly to form structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome contains a single DNA molecule, wrapped tightly around spool-like proteins called histones, which provide chromosomes their structure. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, which are found inside each cell's nucleus, the control center of the cell.\nMost chromosomes look like microscopic Xs; that said, humans and most other mammals carry a pair of sex chromosomes that can be either X or Y-shaped, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute. In general, females carry two X sex chromosomes in each body cell and males carry one X and one Y. But there is some natural variation in the number of sex chromosomes people carry \u2014 sometimes, there may be extra sex chromosomes, or one might be missing, so other patterns, such as X, XXX, XXY and XXYY, can also occur, Discover reported.\nWho discovered DNA?\nDNA was first observed by Swiss biochemist Friedrich Miescher in 1869, according to a paper published in 2005 in the journal Developmental Biology. Miescher used biochemical methods to isolate DNA \u2014 which he then called nuclein \u2014 from white blood cells and sperm, and determined that it was very different from protein. (The term \"nucleic acid\" derives from \"nuclein.\")\nBut for many years, researchers did not realize the importance of this molecule.\nIn 1952, chemist Rosalind Franklin, who was working in the lab of biophysicist Maurice Wilkins, used X-ray diffraction \u2014 a way of determining the structure of a molecule by the way X-rays bounce off it \u2014 to learn that DNA had a helical structure. Franklin documented this structure in what became known as Photo 51.\nIn 1953, Wilkins showed the photo to biologists James Watson and Francis Crick \u2014 without Franklin's knowledge. Armed with the information that DNA was a double helix and previous reports that the bases adenine and thymine occurred in equal amounts within DNA, as did guanine and cytosine, Watson and Crick published a landmark 1953 paper in the journal Nature. In that paper, they proposed the iconic double-helix model of DNA as we now know it, with sugar-phosphate sides and rungs made up of A-T and G-C base pairs. They also suggested that, based on their proposed structure, DNA could be copied \u2014 and, therefore, passed on.\nWatson, Crick and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1962 \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material.\" Franklin was not included in the award, even though her work was integral to the research.\nWhat is the function of DNA?\nGenes encode proteins that perform all sorts of functions for humans (and other living beings).\nThe human gene HBA1, for example, contains instructions for building the protein alpha globin, which is a component of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells, according to the NLM. To take another example, the gene OR6A2 encodes an olfactory receptor, a protein that detects odors in the nose, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Gene database. Depending on which version of OR6A2 you have, you may love cilantro or think it tastes like soap, according to a study published in 2012 in the journal Flavour.\nAlthough each one of your 37.2 trillion cells carries a copy of your DNA, not all cells build the same proteins. One reason for this is that molecules called \"transcription factors\" latch onto DNA to control which genes get switched on and off, and therefore, which proteins get made when, where and in what quantities in each cell, Live Science previously reported. DNA also gets packaged slightly differently in different cell types, and this influences how and where transcription factors can grab onto the molecule.\nIn addition, epigenetics \u2014 which literally means \"above\" or \"on top of\" genetics \u2014 refers to external modifications to DNA that turn specific genes on or off.\nFor instance, small molecules called methyl groups can attach to a DNA strand and prevent specific genes from being expressed. Another example of epigenetics is called \"histone modification,\" where changes to the spool-like proteins inside chromosomes can make specific segments of DNA more or less accessible to the proteins that \"read\" genes. Such epigenetic changes to DNA can be passed onto future generations if the changes occur in sperm or egg cells, Live Science previously reported.\nHow is DNA sequenced?\nDNA sequencing involves technology that allows researchers to determine the order of bases in a section of DNA. The technology can be used to determine the order of bases in genes, chromosomes or an entire genome. In 2000, researchers completed a \"working draft\" sequence of the human genome, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute, and finished the project in 2003.\nDNA testing\nA person's DNA contains information about their heritage, and it can sometimes reveal whether they are at an elevated risk for certain diseases.\nDNA tests, or genetic tests, are used for a variety of reasons, including to diagnose genetic disorders, to determine whether a person is a carrier of a genetic mutation that they could pass on to their children and to examine whether a person is at risk for a genetic disease. For instance, certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are known to increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers, and a genetic test can reveal whether a person has these mutations.\nGenetic test results can have implications for a person's health, and the tests are often provided along with genetic counseling to help individuals understand the results and consequences.\nPeople also use the results of genetic testing to find relatives and learn about their family trees through companies such as Ancestry and MyHeritage.\nAdditional resources and reading\n- Learn about how much of your DNA is just \"junk\" with SciShow on Youtube.\n- Read more about how DNA testing works with Science News for Students.\n- Check out renowned science writer Carl Zimmer's 2018 book, \"She Has Her Mother's Laugh: The Powers, Perversions, and Potential of Heredity.\"\nBibliography\nBerg, J.

      "text": "Newly discovered 'ghost' lineage linked to ancient mystery population in Tibet, DNA study finds\nA study of more than 100 genomes from people who lived in ancient China has unmasked a \"ghost\" in their midst.\nA 7,100-year-old skeleton from China has revealed a \"ghost\" lineage that scientists had only theorized about until now, a new study finds.\nResearchers made the discovery while studying ancient skeletons that could help them map the diverse genetics of central China. The DNA of this ghost lineage individual, an Early Neolithic woman who was buried at the Xingyi archaeological site in southwestern China's Yunnan province, also holds clues to the origins of Tibetan people.\n\"There likely were more of her kind, but they just haven't been sampled yet,\" study co-author Qiaomei Fu, a paleontologist at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, told Live Science in an email.\nFu and colleagues detailed their analysis of 127 human genomes from southwestern China in a study published May 29 in the journal Science. Most of the skeletons that they sampled were dated between 1,400 and 7,150 years ago and came from Yunnan province, which today has the highest ethnic and linguistic diversity in all of China.\n\"Ancient humans that lived in this region may be key to addressing several remaining questions on the prehistoric populations of East and Southeast Asia,\" the researchers wrote in the study. Those unanswered questions include the origins of people who live on the Tibetan Plateau, as previous studies have shown that Tibetans have northern East Asian ancestry along with a unique ghost ancestry that has mystified researchers.\nThe oldest person the researchers tested was found to be the missing link between Tibetans and the ghost' lineage.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nGhost hunters\nAt the Xingyi archaeological site in central Yunnan, dozens of burials were discovered that dated from the Neolithic period (7000 to 2000 B.C.) to the Bronze Age (2000 to 770 B.C.). Beneath all the other burials, archaeologists found a female skeleton with no grave goods. Carbon dating revealed she lived about 7,100 years ago, and isotope analysis of her diet showed she was probably a hunter-gatherer.\nBut genomic analysis of the woman, who has been named Xingyi_EN, was a surprise: her ancestry was not very similar to East and South Asians but was closer to a \"deeply diverged\" Asian population whose genes contributed to the ghost population only seen in modern Tibetans.\nA \"ghost population\" refers to a group of people who were not previously known from skeletal remains but whose existence has been inferred through statistical analysis of ancient and modern DNA.\nThe mystery ancestry seen in Xingyi_EN does not match Neanderthals or Denisovans, both well-known ancient populations that did contribute some \"ghost\" DNA to humans. Rather, Xingyi_EN is evidence of a previously unknown lineage that diverged from other humans at least 40,000 years ago, according to the researchers, and has been named the Basal Asian Xingyi lineage.\nFor thousands of years, the lineage was separated from other human groups, meaning there was no admixture \u2014 interbreeding that would mix their DNA. \"The possible isolation allowed this ancestry to persist without apparent admixture with other populations,\" Fu said.\nBut at some point, Xingyi_EN's relatives did interbreed with other groups of East Asian ancestry, mixing DNA. \"The mixed population has lasted for quite a long time and contributed genes to some Tibetans today,\" Fu explained.\nHowever, these results should be taken with caution, the researchers noted in the study. Given the genetic evidence comes from just a single person, further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between Xingyi_EN and the Tibetan ghost lineage.\nStone Age quiz: What do you know about the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic?\nKristina Killgrove is a staff writer at Live Science with a focus on archaeology and paleoanthropology news.

      "text": "Oldest and most complete ancient Egyptian human genome ever sequenced reveals ties to Mesopotamia\nIn a first, researchers have sequenced the complete genome of a man from ancient Egypt, and the results reveal that he had genetic ties with Mesopotamian DNA.\nScientists have sequenced the oldest and most complete genome from ancient Egypt \u2014 and the DNA reveals that a man who lived 5,000 years ago had roots in both Mesopotamia and North Africa, a new study finds.\nThe man \u2014 who lived during the Old Kingdom in the third millennium B.C., just a few centuries after Upper and Lower Egypt unified into one empire \u2014 provides researchers with a rare glimpse into the genetic roots of ancient Egyptians.\nThe individual's body was first recovered from a tomb in Nuwayrat, in Upper Egypt, in 1902 and now reveals new information about the genetic makeup of early Egyptians. Prior to this analysis, only three ancient Egyptian genomes had been sequenced, and all were partial.\n\"I was very surprised\" by the success of the sequencing, study co-author Pontus Skoglund, who studies ancient DNA at The Francis Crick Institute in the U.K., said at a news conference Tuesday (July 1), before the paper's publication. \"It was a long shot that it would work, as it is with many of these individuals.\"\nAn old potter\nRadiocarbon dating found that the man had lived around 2855 to 2570 B.C., during the Old Kingdom, a period known for its stability, innovation, and the construction of the step pyramid and the Great Pyramid of Giza, according to a statement.\nHe was buried in a ceramic pot within a rock-cut tomb and was preserved well enough that two DNA extracts from the roots of his teeth could be sequenced. Researchers compared his genome against a library of thousands of known DNA samples.\nEventually, they found that most of the man's genome could be traced to North African Neolithic ancestry, according to the study, which was published in the journal Nature Wednesday (July 2). About 20% of his DNA was linked to the eastern Fertile Crescent, including ancient Mesopotamia and its neighboring regions.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe facial reconstruction of the Egyptian man whose genome can be traced to ancient Mesopotamia.\nRemains were buried in a pottery coffin in Nuwayrat, in Upper Egypt, in 1902.\nScientists analyzed the genome of an ancient individual found in Nuwayrat (red dot), about 165 miles (265 kilometers) south of Cairo. It's rare to find preserved human DNA from ancient Egypt, but another individual's DNA from Abusir el-Meleq (purple diamond) from the Third Intermediate Period (circa 1070 to 713 B.C.) was previously sequenced.\nThis body was uniquely well preserved compared with those of other ancient Egyptians, which often degrade due to the high temperatures of the region. \"The pot burial, in combination with the rock-cut tomb into which the pot burial was placed, provided a stable environment\" that likely helped preserve the DNA, study co-author Linus Girdland-Flink, an archaeologist at the University of Aberdeen in the U.K., explained at the news conference.\nRelated: Why are so many ancient Egyptians buried at the Saqqara necropolis?\nThe man's remains provide clues about his life in ancient Egypt nearly 5,000 years ago. He lived to between 44 and 64 years old, which would have been considered an advanced age for his time. The high degree of osteoporosis and arthritis suggests he was on the higher end of that age bracket, study co-author Joel Irish, a bioarchaeologist at Liverpool John Moores University in the U.K., said at the conference.\nThe man's ceramic-pot burial and rock tomb point to an elevated social status, which contrasts with the many signs of hard physical labor on his remains. Irish found evidence that the man had held his hands out and sat for extended periods of time \u2014 a clue that he may have been a potter.\nAncient Egypt's genetic roots\nBecause most of the man's genetic ancestry is linked to North Africa, it's likely that \"at least part of the Egyptian population mainly emerged from local population,\" study first author Adeline Morez Jacobs, a biological anthropologist at the University of Padua in Italy, said at the conference.\nMore notably, the link to Mesopotamia \"was quite interesting because we actually know from archaeology that the Egyptian and the eastern Fertile Crescent cultures influenced each other for millennia,\" she said. It was already known that the groups shared goods, domesticated plants and animals, writing systems and farming practices, but this genome is evidence that the populations intermixed more deeply.\nHowever, Morez Jacobs cautioned that this man's DNA may not represent the broader Egyptian population of his time. \"We need to remember, this is a single individual,\" she said. \"We didn't capture the full diversity of the population.\"\nAncient Egypt quiz: Test your smarts about pyramids, hieroglyphs and King Tut\nPerri Thaler is an intern at Live Science.

This project took over years, saw the development of new approaches to spatial statistics, stature, and chronology and required the physical experience of excavation to understand. The projects aim was to take a holistic and comprehensive approach to understanding cemetery development and horizontal stratigraphy and to use this to really drill down into the complex, unique local development of cemetery sites to explore the role of the individual, the family and household and their impact on localised expressions of gender, life course and wealth. A number of research papers resulted, and these present a methodological perspectives on space, social time or the dynamic of regional mobility and family identity. The largest single product of this project has been the publication of large open access book titled \u2018Early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries: Kinship, community, identity\u2019\nThe DNA of Early Medieval Migration\nOur history is contained with our Genes. An exploration of this ideas with Stephan Schiffels who was at the Sagner Institute. This first exploration of the biology of migration was first published in Nature Communication in 2016. It explored samples for Oakington sixth century cemetery, since then we have expanded the collaboration to include Max Planck, Jena, Harvard and Huddersfield and we have been busy collecting samples, lots and lots of samples from the UK and the continent. The results are spectacular. Watch out for the forthcoming publications for more.\nExcavation and Heritage Projects\nRibchester Revisited\nThe Ribchester Project was a five-year excavation situated over the north gate of the Roman fort. It combined excavation and heritage project involving geophysics, survey, text pitting and a large excavation focused on the later fort. The project contributed to the protection of the fort, and cumulated in Ribchester being removed from English Heritages at Risk List. Importantly it has also established that occupation within the fort extended well beyond AD370 when it was believed abandoned. During the excavation and initial post excavation phase we collected and sieved one of the most comprehensive environmental samples possible. The project involved collaboration the ANU, and was funded via this collaboration, thought the IFR and contributions for English Heritage. Post Excavation work continues. Visit the discussion about this project on the Foreign countries podcast.\nOakington, Life on the Edge/Bones without Barriers\nOakington was a large early Anglo-Saxon cemetery in Cambridgeshire dated between he early fifth and sixth centuries AD. I was PI for the excavation between 2010 and 2014 and worked in collaboration with Oxford Archaeology East and Manchester Metropolitan University. Funding came for the IFR (Excavation) and Leverhulme (Outreach) and Welcome (DNA) with university support for a dedicated PhD student looking at tooth metrics. The primary aims of the project were to look at life on the edge of the fen in the early middle ages, and to explore the ethics and heritage implications of excavating the ancient dead without screens and in full public view.\nAt the time of writing there are seven key publications which report results from this project and have looked at the ancient DNA, the long term impact of excavating the dead within a community outreach project, or the presence of a pregnant woman, or fully articulated cow on the site as well as its spatial origination and dating.

      "text": "Severe drought helped bring about 'barbarian' invasion of Roman Britain, study finds\nA drought helped bring about an invasion of Roman Britain in A.D. 367, researchers wrote in a new paper.\nA severe three-year drought helped bring about a \"barbarian\" invasion of Roman Britain in A.D. 367, a new study finds.\nIn that year, Roman troops stationed at Hadrian's Wall on the empire's northern frontier rebelled and three different \"barbarian\" groups invaded Roman Britain, with the Picts attacking northern Britain from Scotland, the Scotti invading western Britain from Ireland and the Saxons invading southern Britain from the European continent.\nThe rebellion and attacks weakened the Western Roman Empire's hold on the province of Britannia. The violence led to the capture or death of senior Roman commanders, and some Roman soldiers are said to have deserted to join the \"barbarians,\" according to a statement.\nThe Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus (lived circa 330 to 395) claimed in his book \"Res Gestae\" (Latin for \"things done\" or \"things that happened\") that the three groups conspired with each other against the Western Roman Empire; and other historians have called the events the \"barbarian conspiracy.\" While the Western Roman Empire, which included parts of Western Europe, Central Europe and North Africa, regained control of southern Britain in 369, they were forced to abandon it permanently in 410.\nNow, a new analysis of oak tree rings from southern Britain and northern France reveals that a severe drought plagued the region from 364 to 366.\n\"A sequence of severe summer droughts from 364 to 366 not only contributed to prolonged harvest failures and food shortages, but also played a role in the 'Barbarian Conspiracy', a catastrophic military defeat for Roman Britain in 367,\" the researchers wrote in a study published April 16 in the journal Climatic Change.\nScientists used tree rings to estimate the amount of precipitation that fell on southern Britain from the fourth to sixth centuries. From A.D. 350 to 500, the average monthly precipitation during the main growing season, which lasts from April to July, was 2 inches (51 millimeters). However, it was far less during the years of the rebellion and attacks: in 364, it was 1.14 inches (29 mm); in 365 it was 1.10 inches (28 mm); and in 366 it was 1.45 inches (37 mm), the team found.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\"Drought from 364 to 366 would have impacted spring-sown crop growth substantially, triggering poor harvests,\" study lead author Charles Norman, a doctoral student in the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge, said in the statement.\nHistorical accounts support this: in 367, Ammianus Marcellinus wrote that the population in Britain was in \"utmost conditions of famine.\"\nThis food shortage would have affected deliveries of food to Roman troops at Hadrian's Wall, damaging their morale, the researchers wrote in the paper.\n\"Three consecutive droughts would have had a devastating impact on the productivity of Roman Britain's most important agricultural region,\" study co-author Ulf B\u00fcntgen, a professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge, said in the statement. \"As Roman writers tell us, this resulted in food shortages with all of the destabilizing societal effects this brings.\"\nThe team was careful not to blame the rebellion and invasion entirely on the famine, however. They noted that the Western Roman Empire was experiencing political and economic problems during this time that would have affected its ability to respond to the problems in Britain.\n\"We propose the 364\u2013366 drought as an environmental catalyst that may explain the scale and abrupt nature of the event,\" the researchers wrote in the study.\nRoman emperor quiz: Test your knowledge on the rulers of the ancient empire\nOwen Jarus is a regular contributor to Live Science who writes about archaeology and humans' past.

      "text": "Royal tomb in Benin has traces of human blood on its walls, hinting at human sacrifice, study finds\nResearchers examining the wall of a ceremonial tomb in Benin found proteins that could have come only from human blood.\nNearly 200 years ago, human blood is said to have been incorporated into a ceremonial tomb built within a royal palace complex in what is now Benin, according to legend. Now, an investigation into the proteins found within the tomb's walls reveals evidence that the legend is true.\nAccording to a new study, the tomb at Abomey, once the capital of the West African kingdom of Dahomey, contains proteins that could have come only from human blood, confirming the site's grisly history.\nIt's one of the first times such a discovery has been made through \"paleoproteomics,\" the study of trace proteins left behind in archaeological contexts.\n\"This discovery is important, as it provides concrete evidence of historical rituals and practices,\" biochemist Jean Armengaud, an expert on ancient proteins at France's Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, told Live Science.\nArmengaud is the senior author of the new study, which was published May 29 in the journal Proteomics. He and his colleagues examined samples taken at the tomb between 2018 and 2022, during excavations at the site by archaeologists from France and Benin.\nRelated: 7 extraordinary African kingdoms from ancient times to centuries ago\nAccording to local lore, the tomb within the Abomey palace complex \u2014 built in the 19th century by King Ghezo of Dahomey, in honor of his brother King Adandozan \u2014 used plaster that included the blood of 41 human sacrifices; 41 was considered a sacred number, the authors wrote in the study.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nDahomey king\nGhezo, who ruled from 1818 until 1858, famously led several military expeditions against the region's powerful Yoruba state, or Oyo Empire, and thereby ended the Dahomey kingdom's annual tribute of slaves.\nHe was considered a powerful ruler and reportedly showcased the deaths of his foes to secure his reign. According to historical accounts, the path to his hut was paved with the skulls and jawbones of defeated enemies, and one of his thrones stood on the skulls of four enemy leaders.\nDahomey, now called Benin after the nearby Bight (or Bay) of Benin, is a center of the original African Vodun or Vodou religion that was developed in the Caribbean region. Traditional Vodun often features sacrifices of animal blood.\nDistinctive proteins\nThe researchers applied a technique called tandem mass spectrometry \u2014to proteins contained in samples of the wall of the tomb, which consists of two round huts joined together. The method breaks down ions into fragments to reveal their chemical structure.\nTheir study yielded more than 10,000 matches in a database of proteins that identified the presence of thousands of microorganisms, as well as both human and chicken blood.\n\"Since proteins are more stable molecules compared to DNA, paleoproteomics can provide extensive information about the organisms that produced these proteins in ancient times,\" Armengaud said.\nThe results show clearly that human blood was one of the substances in the wall \u2014 in line with historical accounts, never verified until now, that claimed blood from human sacrifices was mixed with \"red oil\" and sacred water to make the plaster.\nIn this case, Armengaud said, the paleoproteomic study was preferable to a paleogenomic study with ancient DNA, which might detect genetic material from individuals, such as the people who built the structure, without determining how they were involved.\nBut paleoproteomics and paleogenomics can also complement each other. Armengaud hopes DNA sequencing of samples from the Abomey tomb can identify the number of sacrificial victims and their origins, thereby providing a more detailed historical context.\nMatthew Collins, an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge who wasn't involved in the latest study, told Live Science that the research showed how proteomics could be applied in complex and challenging situations.\n\"If you were using DNA, then you could tell that certain species were present \u2014 but what you couldn't determine is the type of tissues that were involved,\" he said. \"But here you've got evidence of tissue proteins associated with human blood.\"\nTom Metcalfe is a freelance journalist and regular Live Science contributor who is based in London in the United Kingdom.

      "text": "4,000-year-old bones reveal 'unprecedented' violence \u2014 tongue removal, cannibalism and evisceration in Bronze Age Britain\nThe extremely violent treatment of the corpses of at least 37 Bronze Age people is rewriting the history of prehistoric Britain.\nMore than 4,000 years ago, nearly 40 people died extremely violent deaths in what is now England, with a modern analysis of their bones revealing scalping, tongue removal, decapitation, defleshing, evisceration and cannibalism.\n\"It paints a considerably darker picture of the period than many would have expected,\" Rick Schulting, an archaeologist at the University of Oxford, said in a statement, and it's \"a stark reminder that people in prehistory could match more recent atrocities.\"\nSchulting and colleagues published a detailed study of these skeletons Monday (Dec. 16) in the journal Antiquity. They noted that, in the 1970s, archaeologists found more than 3,000 bone fragments in a 66-foot-deep (20 meters) natural limestone shaft at the site of Charterhouse Warren in the county of Somerset in southwest England. At least 37 people, who ranged in age from newborns to adults, were found in the shaft, and radiocarbon dates suggest the people died at least four millennia ago, during the Early Bronze Age (2200 to 2000 B.C.).\nLooking closely at the fragmented bones, the research team determined that at least 30% of the skulls had been fractured around the time of death, implying that many \u2014 or possibly all \u2014 of the people suffered violent deaths. What happened after death was even more gruesome.\nAdditionally, the researchers found that roughly 20% of the bones had cut marks, most of which had been made with stone tools. The cut marks' locations revealed the kinds of violent actions the dead bodies were subjected to: Cut marks on the frontal bone of one skull suggested scalping, long slicing marks on a lower jaw of another person suggested tongue removal, and cuts on the ribs may be from evisceration, the team said. At least six people had cut marks on their second cervical vertebra, which meant they were decapitated, and a number of small hand and foot bones had crushing fractures consistent with human chewing.\nRelated: Ritually bent Bronze Age sword unearthed in Danish bog is 'very rare find'\nThe sheer number of violent deaths and extensive processing of the bodies are extremely unusual for Bronze Age Britain, the researchers noted in their study, and the practices are clearly not related to any known funeral rite.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\"The presence of at least 37 individuals suggests the massacre of a substantial segment of a community,\" the researchers wrote. \"In this case, the violence may have continued postmortem,\" and it is likely that \"the aim was to not only eradicate another group, but to thoroughly 'other' them in the process.\"\nBut the reason for the brutal mass murder and cannibalism is not clear. The researchers suggested that the level of violence \"could indicate that the actions were retaliatory, in response to a previous violent event or the perceived breach of a serious social taboo,\" meaning the violence was not meaningless but rather an intensely political act.\n\"The assemblage from Charterhouse Warren definitely shows signs of perimortem [around the time of death] trauma along with numerous tool marks consistent with body processing,\" Anna Osterholtz, a bioarchaeologist at Mississippi State University who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.\n\"Violence like this often has a social function,\" Osterholtz said, because \"violent acts, when performed in front of an audience, are important for group identity formation and the negotiation of social relationships.\" But what the violence tells us about group identity can be gleaned only from archaeological evidence.\nOne possible clue to the massacre comes from the identification of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, in the teeth of two children found at Charterhouse Warren, the researchers noted. The fact that at least two people had plague when they died \"raises the possibility that illness exacerbated a sense of fear in the region,\" the researchers wrote.\nResearch on these Early Bronze Age human remains has not been completed. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory,\" the researchers wrote.\nKristina Killgrove is a staff writer at Live Science with a focus on archaeology and paleoanthropology news.

      "text": "Who were the Vandals, the 'barbarians' who sacked Rome?\nThe Vandals sacked Rome and carved out a kingdom in North Africa.\nThe Vandals were a Germanic people who sacked Rome and founded a kingdom in North Africa that flourished for about a century, until it was conquered by the Byzantine Empire in A.D. 534.\nHistory has not been kind to the Vandals. The word \"vandal\" has become synonymous with destruction, in part because the texts about them were written mainly by Romans and other non-Vandals.\nDespite this modern name association, the Vandals were likely no more violent or destructive than their contemporaries. While the Vandals did sack Rome in A.D. 455, they spared most of the city's inhabitants and didn't burn down its buildings. \"Despite the negative connotation their name now carries, the Vandals conducted themselves much better during the sack of Rome than did many other invading barbarians,\" Torsten Cumberland Jacobsen, a former curator of the Royal Danish Arsenal Museum, wrote in his book \"A History of the Vandals\" (Westholme Publishing, 2012).\nVandalism\nIt wasn't until after the French Revolution, in the late 18th century, that the name \"Vandals\" became widely associated with destruction, Stephen Kershaw, who holds a doctorate in classics, wrote in his book \"The Enemies of Rome: The Barbarian Rebellion Against the Roman Empire\" (Pegasus Books, 2020).\nKershaw noted that the French abbot Henri Gr\u00e9goire de Blois used the term \"Vandalisme\" to describe the destruction of artwork during and after the French Revolution, in reference to the \"barbarian\" sacking of the \"civilized\" ancient Rome. The word \"vandalism\" then became widely used to describe acts of damage and destruction.\nEarly Vandal history\nAround the fourth century A.D. the name \"Vandal\" tended to be applied to two tribal confederations, the Hasding and Siling Vandals, but in earlier times it likely covered a greater number of tribes under the name 'Vandili,' Jacobsen wrote.\nJacobsen noted that the Vandals may have originated in southern Scandinavia, and that the name Vandal \"appears [in historical records] in central Sweden in the parish of Vendel, old Swedish Vaendil.\"\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThere are few surviving records of the Vandals' early years. One of the oldest written records of the Vandals comes from the Roman writer Cassius Dio (A.D. 155 to 235). He told of a group of Vandals led by two chiefs named Ra\u00fcs and Raptus, who made an incursion into Dacia (around modern-day Romania) and eventually made a deal with the Romans to acquire land.\nAnother writer named Jordanes (a person of Gothic descent who lived in the sixth century A.D.) claimed that in the fourth century A.D., the Vandals controlled a substantial amount of territory north of the Danube River but were defeated by the Goths and sought refuge with the Romans. Today, some scholars believe this claim is untrue. \"Recent historians divide roughly fifty-fifty on whether to take Jordanes\" word about this defeat and [resettlement in Roman territory],\" Walter Goffart, emeritus professor of history at the University of Toronto, wrote in his book \"Barbarian Tides: The Migration Age and the Later Roman Empire\" (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006).\nUltimately, evidence of the Vandals' early years in written records remains scarce, and there are also few early archaeological remains to help fill in the record.\n\"From their first appearance on the Danube frontier in the second century to [their defeat of the Romans in southern Spain] in 422, the Vandals appear only fleetingly within our written sources and leave little or no mark on the archaeological record,\" Andy Merrills, an associate professor of ancient history at the University of Leicester in the U.K., and Richard Miles, a professor of Roman history and archaeology at the University of Sydney in Australia, wrote in their book \"The Vandals\" (Wiley, 2014).\nCrossing the Rhine\nAround A.D. 375, a people called the Huns arrived north of the Danube from the Eurasian steppe, and they drove a number of other peoples \u2014 likely including the Vandals \u2014 to migrate toward the Roman Empire. This put a great deal of pressure on the Roman Empire, which by this point was facing frequent crises and had divided into Eastern and Western halves to better control the empire's vast territory.\n\"In 401, [Roman general] Stilicho, himself of Vandal origins, managed to stop the Vandals' plundering migration through the province of Raetia and engaged them as federates [allies] to settle in the provinces of Vindelica and Noricum,\" near the Roman frontier in central Europe in an area that now includes parts of Germany and Austria, Jacobsen wrote.\nThis arrangement soon fell apart. On Dec. 31, 406, a group of Vandals successfully crossed the Rhine river and advanced into the Roman territory of Gaul [what is now France, parts of Belgium and parts of western Germany], and they fought battles against the Franks, another Germanic people. The Franks had already crossed into Roman territory allying with them at times.\nRoman inaction and counterattack\nAt first, the Vandal march into Roman territory did not attract much attention, as the Western Roman emperor Honorius faced more immediate problems: One of his generals had seized control of Britain and part of Gaul and styled himself as Emperor Constantine III.\n\"Constantine [III's] usurpation, and the invasion of the troops from Britain, was perceived to be a far greater threat to the stability of the empire than the activity of some barbarians to the north,\" Merrills and Miles wrote.\nAmid the chaos engulfing the Western Roman Empire, the Vandals made their way to Iberia (modern-day Spain and Portugal) around A.D. 410. There, the Siling Vandals took over the province of Baetica (south central Spain), while the Hasding Vandals took part of Gallaecia (northwest Spain).\nIn A.D. 418, the Siling Vandals suffered a defeat at the hands of the Visigoths. The Hasdings were then pushed out of Gallaecia by a Roman army, Goffart wrote.\nAfter these losses, the Vandal survivors united in southern Spain and fought against the Romans again in 422. This time, they won a pivotal victory in a battle near Tarraco (now called Tarragona), a port city in Spain. The victory saved the Vandals from destruction.\nThe Vandal forces were led or co-led by a man named Gunderic, while a general named Castinus led the Roman forces, who tried to starve the Vandal forces by cutting off their supply lines, Jeroen W.P. Wijnendaele, a senior postdoctoral research fellow at Ghent University in Belgium, wrote in his book \"The Last of the Romans: Bonifatius \u2014 Warlord and comes Africae\" (Bloomsbury, 2015).\nAt first, this strategy was successful. However, the Visigoths, who had been allied with the Romans, deserted the Roman contingent, reducing the size of the Roman forces. Then, Castinus launched a full-out attack against the Vandals rather than continuing to cut off their supply lines.\nThe Romans were \"soundly beaten\" in the assault, and the Vandals \"won their first major victory since having crossed the Rhine and were clearly established as the dominant force in southern Spain,\" Wijnendaele wrote. In the years following their victory, the Vandals consolidated their hold on Spain, capturing Seville after launching two campaigns against the city in 425 and 428, Wijnendaele noted.\nVandal conquest of North Africa\nIn A.D. 428, a new Vandal leader named Genseric (also spelled Gaiseric or Geiseric) ascended the throne and led the Vandals to North Africa. Under Genseric's rule, which lasted about 50 years, the Vandals took over much of North Africa and established a kingdom there.\nThis conquest was made easier by Roman infighting. In A.D. 429, the Western Roman Empire was ruled by a child named Valentinian III, who depended on his mother, Galla Placidia, for advice. A Roman general named Aetius had her ear and conspired against the governor of North Africa, a powerful rival named Bonifatius (also spelled Bonifacius). This resulted in Bonifatius being deemed an enemy of the Western Roman Empire.\nBy the time the Vandals invaded North Africa, Bonifatius' forces had already beaten off two attacks launched by the Western Roman Empire, Wijnendaele wrote.\nSome ancient writers claimed that Bonifatius invited the Vandals into North Africa to fight on his behalf against the Western Roman Empire. However, Wijnendaele noted that the ancient writers who made that claim lived at least a century after the events took place, while the ancient writers who lived in Africa around the time of the invasion made no such claim.\nRegardless of whether Bonifatius invited them, the Vandals scarcely needed an invitation. North Africa, at that time, was a wealthy area that provided Rome with much of its grain.\nThe Vandals advanced quickly into North Africa and laid siege to the city of Hippo Regius (modern-day Annaba, Algeria) in A.D. 430. Wijnendaele noted that even in the best-case scenario, Bonifatius' troops would have been outnumbered 3 to 1.\nThe Vandals laid siege to Hippo Regius for over a year but were unable to take the city, and they were eventually forced to withdraw. Procopius, a writer who lived in the sixth century, wrote that the Vandals \"were unable to secure Hippo Regius either by force or by surrender, and since at the same time they were being pressed by hunger, they raised the siege\" (translation by Wijnendaele).\nReinforcements from the Eastern Roman Empire arrived and, with Bonifatius' forces, directly attacked the withdrawing Vandal force. The attack was a disaster for the Romans. \"A fierce battle was fought in which they were badly beaten by the enemy, and they made haste to flee as each one could,\" Procopius wrote. After this defeat, the Romans abandoned Hippo Regius, and the Vandals sacked the city.\nIn A.D. 435, the Romans signed a peace treaty in which they ceded part of North Africa \u2014 what is now Morocco and Algeria\u2014 to the Vandals. But in A.D. 439, the Vandals broke the treaty and captured the city of Carthage (modern-day Tunis, Tunisia), before advancing into Sicily.\nAs the Vandals took over territory in North Africa, they persecuted members of the Catholic clergy. The Vandals followed a different type of Christianity, known as Arianism.\n\"Arianism was the teaching of the priest Arius [A.D. 250 to 336], who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, in the early fourth century. His main belief was that the Son, Jesus, had been created by his father, God. God was therefore unbegotten and had always existed, and so was superior to the Son. The Holy Spirit had been created by Jesus under the auspices of the Father, and so was subservient to them both,\" Jacobsen wrote. The Catholic belief (the Trinity) is somewhat different, holding that God is present in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, making them one and equal.\nThese differing beliefs set the Vandals apart from the Romans, which led to the Vandals persecuting Roman clergy and the Romans condemning the Vandals as heretics.\nVandal sack of Rome\nAt its height, the Vandal kingdom encompassed an area of North Africa along the Mediterranean coast in modern-day Tunisia and Algeria, as well as numerous islands that included Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Malta, Mallorca and Ibiza. This gave them control of much of Rome's grain supply.\nThe Vandal king Genseric had become extremely powerful and influential by A.D. 455, and his son, Huneric, was set to marry a Roman princess named Eudocia. When Valentinian III, who had by that point reached adulthood, was murdered in that year, Eudocia was pledged to another man. In response to this offense, the enraged Genseric moved his forces toward Rome.\nThe Romans were powerless to stop him. According to one tradition, the Romans didn't even bother to send out an army but instead sent Pope Leo I out to reason with Genseric. Whether this really happened is unknown, but the Vandals were allowed to enter Rome and plunder it unopposed, so long as they avoided killing the inhabitants and burning down the city.\n\"For fourteen days, the Vandals slowly and leisurely plunder the city of its wealth. Everything was taken down from the Imperial Palace on the Palatine Hill, and the churches were emptied of their collected treasures,\" Jacobsen wrote.\n\"Despite the great indignity of the sack of Rome, it appears that Genseric was true to his word and did not destroy the buildings. Also, we hear nothing of any killings\" Jacobsen wrote. However, in some ancient accounts, Genseric captured Romans and took them back to North Africa as slaves.\nFollowing the sacking, the Vandals returned to their kingdom in North Africa. However, North Africa was a key source of grain, and the Romans tried to take it back on several occasions. The emperor Avitus (reign A.D. 455 to 456) launched a campaign against the Vandals that failed, and in response the Vandals cut off Italy's grain supply, Kershaw noted, which fueled civil unrest in Rome. Avitus' successor, Majoran (reign 457 to 461), launched a campaign against the Vandals that also failed, and he was forced to sign a peace treaty with them. The emperor Procopius Anthemius (reign 467 to 472), aided by forces from the Eastern Roman Empire, launched another campaign to take back North Africa that included an armada of 1,100 ships, noted Kershaw. After some initial success, this fleet suffered heavy losses due to the Vandals' use of fireships (ships loaded with flammable materials and set on fire near enemy ships), and ultimately this campaign also failed, and the Romans were forced to sign another peace treaty.\nVandal decline\nGenseric died in A.D. 476 and ultimately outlived the Western Roman Empire, which came to an end in A.D. 476 when the last Roman emperor was deposed. \"For almost fifty years, he had ruled the Vandals and taken them from a wandering tribe of little significance to masters of a great kingdom in the rich provinces of Roman North Africa,\" Jacobsen wrote.\nHowever, Genseric's successors faced economic problems, quarrels over succession (Vandal rules stipulated that the eldest male in the family should be king) and conflicts with the Byzantine Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire that was based at Constantinople.\nLater Vandal rulers attempted various remedies to fix the kingdom's precarious situation. A Vandal ruler named Thrasamund (died A.D. 523) forged an alliance through marriage with the Ostrogoths, who controlled Italy. Another Vandal ruler named Hilderic (died A.D. 533) tried to improve relations with the Byzantine Empire but was forced out in a revolt.\nAfter Hilderic's death, the Byzantines launched a successful invasion of the Vandals' kingdom, and the last Vandal king, named Gelimer, was captured and taken to Constantinople. Byzantine Emperor Justinian I treated Gelimer with respect and offered to make him a high-ranking nobleman if Gelimer would forgo his Arian Christian beliefs and convert to the Catholic form of Christianity. However, Gelimer declined the offer.\n\"Refusing the rank of patrician, for which he would have had to abjure his Arian faith, Gelimer was nevertheless invited by Justinian to retire to an estate in Greece \u2014 rather a subdued end for the last of the Vandal kings,\" Merrills and Miles wrote.\nAdditional resources\n- This British Museum blog post written by curator Barry Ager offers a perspective on why the Vandals have such a bad reputation.\n- The Metropolitan Museum of Art has an illustrated essay that looks at the \"Barbarians\" and Rome.\n- This paper published in the journal Revue belge de Philologie et d'Histoire (French for \"Belgian Review of Philology and History\") in 2013 and written by Arbia Hilali, details the importance of North Africa's agriculture for Rome.\nOriginally published on Live Science on Sept. 29, 2017 and updated on Aug. 30, 2022.\nOwen Jarus is a regular contributor to Live Science who writes about archaeology and humans' past.

      "text": "'Very rare' African ebony figurines found in 1,500-year-old Christian burials in Israeli desert\nThree 1,500-year-old burials in the Negev desert have pendants of bone and ebony that may depict the deceased individuals' ancestors.\nArchaeologists in Israel have unearthed three 1,500-year-old Christian burials that contain very rare figurines crafted from ebony and bone and depict people from Africa.\nThe figurines \u2014 which were likely worn as pendants \u2014 might depict these individuals' ancestors, researchers wrote in a new study, which was published in the most recent 2025 issue of the journal 'Atiqot. It's possible that the buried individuals or their ancestors were Africans who had converted to Christianity and then moved to the Negev, the researchers wrote.\n\"The figurines show that a Christian community lived in the south of the country about 1,500 years ago, possibly with some of its members coming from Africa,\" the researchers said in a statement from the Israel Antiquities Authority.\nThe three burials, which held the remains of two women and one child, were found within a cemetery near the archaeological site of Tel Mal\u1e25ata in the northeastern Negev. The cemetery dates to the Roman-Byzantine period and has many cist, or stone-lined graves.\nArchaeologists have been excavating Tel Mal\u1e25ata since the 1970s and have found artifacts showing that the site has been occupied off and one since the Middle Bronze Age (2000 to 1500 B.C.). During the early Roman period, the site had a fortress or fortified mansion, which later became \"a central settlement and an administrative capital\" during the Roman-Byzantine period, the researchers wrote in the study. Various papers have noted that the site sat on \"an important trade crossroads through which passed luxury goods from Arabia and beyond,\" the team wrote in the study.\nTrade likely brought the ebony to the individuals. Ebony is a black wood, which in this case came from the Ceylon ebony (Diospyros ebenum), a slow-growing tree from southern India and Sri Lanka.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe Byzantine Empire began trading with India and Sri Lanka in the fourth century A.D., which provided the empire with plants, spices, cotton, silk and ebony, the researchers noted. The burials date from the sixth to seventh centuries A.D., a few centuries after this trade started.\nMother-child burial\nOf the five figurines analyzed, three are made from bone and two from ebony. While bone figurines were \"common from the Neolithic period onward, and used in domestic rituals as well as in burials,\" the team wrote in the study that \"ebony figurines are very rare.\"\nEven though the deceased were buried in Christian-style burials, \"it is possible that the figures represent ancestors, and thus they reflect traditions passed down from generation to generation \u2014 even after the adoption of the Christian religion,\" the researchers said in the statement.\nOne cist tomb held a woman who died between the ages of 18 and 21 and who had several grave goods: glass vessels, a bronze bracelet and a bone figurine depicting a woman, the researchers reported.\nAnother cist tomb held a woman who may have been slightly older \u2014 she died between the ages of 20 and 30. She was buried with two alabaster jars and several grave goods, including one bone figurine showing the \"upper part of a female body\" and one ebony figurine that \"depicts a very detailed face of a female, with typical African features,\" the researchers wrote in the study.\nThe last cist tomb held the remains of a 6- to 8-year-old child who was buried with bronze jewelry and two figurines \u2014 one made of bone and one of ebony. The ebony pendant \"shows a very detailed face and torso of a male figure, with typical African features,\" the researchers wrote in the study. \"The figurine has long hair, and possibly represents an ancestor of the deceased.\"\nThe ebony pendants in the woman's and child's graves are similar in size and style, which hints that they were related and were perhaps mother and child, the researchers said.\n\"It is likely that a woman and a child who were buried side-by-side, and in whose graves two of the figurines were discovered, belonged to the same family \u2014 and perhaps they were even mother and son,\" the researchers said in the statement.\nLaura is the archaeology and Life's Little Mysteries editor at Live Science.

      "text": "The Roman Empire: Rulers, expansion and fall\nWhile many date the collapse of the Roman Empire to the fifth century, in reality it didn't fall until AD 1453.\nThe Roman Empire began in 27 B.C., when Octavian, Julius Caesar's adopted son and heir, was granted the title \"Augustus,\" meaning \"revered one,\" by the Roman senate. This new title signified Octavian's elevation to the position of emperor in all but name, ending the Roman Republic, according to many modern historians.\nOctavian was granted this title after emerging victorious from a series of civil wars triggered by the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. During these wars Mark Antony, Caesar's former general, fought for control of the Roman world against some of Caesar's assassins, and later he allied with Cleopatra to fight against Octavian\nWhile some of the republic's institutions, such as the senate, continued to function after 27 B.C., their powers were much reduced. Power instead became focused on Augustus and his successors.\nPax Romana\nModern-day historians sometimes use the phrase \"Pax Romana\" (Roman Peace) to describe the period between 27 B.C., when Octavian was given the title Augustus, and A.D. 180, when Emperor Marcus Aurelius died. This phrase is sometimes used because it was a relatively stable period in Roman history, compared to periods before and after these years.\nHowever, relative is the operative term as there were plenty of wars, assassinations and civil strife within the Roman Empire during this period. Augustus tried, in some ways, to portray his period of rule (which lasted until his death in A.D. 14) as a relatively peaceful time.\n\"Among the many images of him [Augustus], relatively few, especially of the statues, busts and reliefs, depict him as a general,\" wrote Adrian Goldsworthy, a historian, in his book \"Pax Romana: War, Peace and Conquest in the Roman World\" (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2016).\nWhile Augustus wanted to depict his period of rule as peaceful, the reality was quite different. During Augustus' rule, the Roman army fought in Iberia, conquering areas that were not already under Roman control. The army also advanced deep into what is now Germany in the hopes of incorporating it into the Roman Empire. This met with disaster when three legions, including their commander, Quintilius Varus, were completely annihilated at the Battle of the Teutoburg forest in A.D. 9.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe Roman historian Suetonius (who lived around A.D. 70 to 122) claimed that this loss had a profound impact on Augustus. \"They say that he was so greatly affected that for several months in succession he cut neither his beard nor his hair, and sometimes he would [bash] his head against a door, crying: 'Quintilius Varus, give me back my legions!' And he observed the day of the disaster each year as one of sorrow and mourning,\" Suetonius wrote (translation by John Carew Rolfe).\nThe Roman historian Tacitus (circa A.D. 55 to 120) claimed that Augustus, in his final will, advised his successor Tiberius (Augustus's adopted son) to not expand the empire but keep it within its present frontiers. While Tiberius, who reigned from A.D. 14 to 37, largely kept the empire within its frontiers, future emperors did not \u2014 with some future military adventures also ending in disaster.\nRelated: 8 powerful female figures of ancient Rome\nThere was also no shortage of strife and civil war during the \"Pax Romana.\" Emperor Caligula, who reigned from A.D. 37 to 41, was killed by members of the Praetorian Guard (the unit in charge of protecting the emperor) and Nero's reign (A.D. 54 to 68) ended in civil war. Emperor Domitian (reign A.D. 81 to 96) was also assassinated during the so-called Pax Romana.\nThe most enduring military conquest made after the death of Augustus came during the reign of Emperor Claudius, who ruled from A.D. 41 to 54. He and his successor, Nero, succeeded in invading and occupying England. The attempt almost failed, and the Romans came close to being expelled while battling the Iceni queen Boudicca in A.D. 60 to 61. Ultimately the Roman Empire was victorious and held onto England until A.D. 410.\nHowever, the Romans' attempts to invade Scotland were unsuccessful. One notable attempt occurred during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius (r. A.D. 138 to 161 ) who captured part of Scotland and built a series of fortifications there that modern-day historians sometimes call the \"Antonine Wall.\" His successors were unable to hold onto even a portion of Scotland and Roman troops eventually retreated to Hadrian's Wall, which is located in northern England around AD 160.\nOther Roman rulers sought to expand the empire during their reign.Emperor Trajan (r. A.D. 98 to 117) launched an ambitious attempt to expand the Roman Empire, conquering Dacia, a territory located around modern-day Romania. The Romans held onto Dacia until the A.D. 270s.\nTrajan also attempted to invade and occupy what is now Iraq. While Trajan succeeded in advancing to the Persian Gulf his forces could not hold onto the territory, and his successor Hadrian (r. A.D. 117 to138 ) withdrew from Iraq and focused on fortifying and consolidating the empire's existing borders.\nThere were also numerous rebellions throughout the empire during the Pax Romana. In Judea, an unsuccessful revolt by the Jews in A.D. 66 to 74 resulted in the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, the most holy site for Jews, by Roman forces; the abandonment of Qumran, the site where the Dead Sea Scrolls were stored in nearby caves; and the destruction of a rebel force at Masada.\nThere were more rebellions in Judea during the Pax Romana, with one rebellion, which ended in A.D. 136, resulting in the slaughter of more than half a million Jews by Roman forces, the survivors fanning out around the world.\nEnd of the Pax Romana\nAfter Marcus Aurelius died in A.D. 180 his son, Commodus, became emperor.. Commodus's rule was plagued by infighting. A failed attempt to assassinate the emperor in A.D. 182 led to the murders of a large number of people accused of being involved in the conspiracy, including many of Marcus Aurelius's senior advisors, wrote David Potter, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Michigan in the book \"The Roman Empire at Bay: AD 180-395 second edition\" (Routledge, 2014).\nOn the evening of Dec. 31, A.D. 192 to Jan. 1, A.D. 193 Narcissus, an athlete who trained Commodus in gladiator fighting, killed the emperor. Civil war then engulfed the Roman Empire, and A.D. 193 A.D. became known as the year of the five emperors.\nTroops loyal to a military commander named Septimus Severus (r. A.D. 193 to 211) ultimately prevailed in the civil war. After gaining control of the empire Severus embarked on a policy of trying to expand the empire's borders, launching a military expedition into modern-day Syria and Iraq.\nWhile Severus succeeded in conquering and controlling the area it came at a great cost. The contemporary historian Cassius Dio (c. A.D. 155 to 235) wrote that the new territory was a \"cause of constant wars and of enormous expense.\" (Translation by David Potter.) Severus also tried to conquer Scotland but died while on campaign.\nAfter Severus' death, a lengthy period of instability ensued, which was exacerbated by invasions from assorted \"barbarian\" groups, including invasions of Greece by the Goths.\nA series of epidemics, sometimes called the \"Plague of Cyprian\" (named after a bishop of Carthage who believed the world was coming to an end) ravaged the Roman Empire between A.D. 250 and 271, killing at least two Roman emperors.\nRelated: 20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history\nThe plague's effects were horrible. \"The intestines are shaken with a continual vomiting, [and] the eyes are on fire with the injected blood,\" Cyprian wrote in a work called \"De mortalitate\" (translation by Philip Schaff).\nReforms of Diocletian\nEmperor Diocletian's reign from A.D. 284 to 305 saw a brief period of relative stability as the emperor enacted a series of radical reforms. Instead of one emperor, Diocletian created a \"tetrarchy\" consisting of four co-emperors \u2014 although he was the most important of the four \u2014 in an effort to stabilize the empire's government.\nDiocletian reformed the economy, coinage, justice system and provincial structure to try and balance the teetering empire. He also sought to prevent the sons of emperors from succeeding their fathers, instead relying on a system of appointments made by the two most senior emperors.\nDiocletian abdicated in A.D. 305, hoping that the tetrarchy system of four co-emperors would be able to peacefully transition, noted Potter. However, the empire fell into civil war not long after Diocletian abdicated, and the tetrarchy system was soon abandoned.\nRise of Christianity\nAs the Roman Empire was ravaged by civil war, invasions and epidemics, Christianity became increasingly popular. The Plague of Cyprian played an important role in Christianity's rise, noted Candida Moss, a professor of religion at the University of Birmingham, U.K., in an article published in 2014 on CNN.\n\"The fact that even Roman emperors were dying and pagan priests had no way to explain or prevent the plague only strengthened the Christian position. The experience of widespread disease and death and the high probability that they themselves might die made Christians more willing to embrace martyrdom,\" Moss wrote.\nChristians still faced persecution despite the growing popularity of their religion. Diocletian in particular persecuted Christians, passing edicts decreeing that Christian churches and manuscripts should be destroyed, any freedmen who became Christians should be enslaved again and that Christians could not seek legal recourse if they were assaulted. His orders were enforced to varying degrees across the empire, noted Potter.\nThe civil wars that followed Diocletian's abdication changed the situation for Christians dramatically. While people today sometimes give Constantine sole credit for legalizing Christianity, in reality there were several competing rulers who issued edicts legalizing Christianity during the 310s.\nUltimately Constantine \u2014 who was the son of one of the four emperors \u2014 prevailed in the civil wars, becoming ruler of the entire Roman Empire in A.D. 324, before dying in A.D. 337. Many ancient Christians and modern-day historians believe that Constantine himself converted to Christianity during his reign and was baptized before his death.\nIn the decades that followed Constantine's death the Roman Empire again fell into civil war, although Christianity gradually grew to become the official religion of the Roman Empire in 380, with pagan groups being persecuted.\nFall of the Roman Empire\nDuring Constantine's reign he ordered the construction of a new city called Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul). After his death the emperor's descendants fought each other for control of the empire.\nA system gradually came into place where there was one emperor in control of the western half of the Roman Empire while a second emperor (ruling from Constantinople) controlled the eastern half. The two emperors at times worked together and at other moments were in conflict with each other. This schism could also be seen in Christianity, as differences between clerics in the eastern and western half of the empire resulted in the rise of the Roman Catholic Church based in the west and Orthodox churches in the east.\nThe fates of the western and eastern halves of the Roman Empire were dramatically different. Throughout the fourth and fifth centuries the eastern half of the Roman Empire continued to thrive and was able to repel various \"barbarian\" invasions. The western half went into decline, gradually losing territory to the various groups that were moving across the Western Roman Empire's borders.\nAn assortment of groups including the Goths, Vandals and Huns took over the western half of the Roman Empire. Ancient Rome was sacked twice, first by the Goths in A.D. 410 and then by the Vandals in A.D. 455. In A.D. 476 the Western Roman Empire officially ceased to exist.\nRelated: Why did Rome fall?\nBut the eastern half, based at Constantinople, continued to thrive, becoming what modern-day historians often call the Byzantine Empire. However, while modern-day historians use this term the people who lived in this empire continued to call themselves Roman. It wasn't until 1453 \u2014 when Constantinople was captured by the Ottoman military \u2014 that the Roman Empire truly ceased to exist.\nAdditional resources\n- View AI portraits of Roman emperors\n- Mary Beard's book \"SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome\" (Liveright, 2015) provides a detailed look at Roman history\n- Learn more about why Rome itself fell in Adrian Goldsworthy's book \"How Rome Fell: Death of a Superpower\" (Yale University Press, 2009)\n- Also check out Goldworthy's book \"In the Name of Rome: The Men Who Won the Roman Empire\" (Yale University Press, 2016)\nFollow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

      "text": "Lion mauled gladiator to death 1,800 years ago in Roman Britain, controversial study suggests\nA skeleton in England may have belonged to a gladiator who died fighting a large cat, possibly a lion, a new study finds.\nBite marks on a 1,800-year-old skeleton from Roman Britain suggest that a gladiator was mauled to death by a large cat, possibly a lion, a new study reports.\nHowever, scholars who were not involved with the research had mixed responses to the team's findings, with one expert saying that this person would not have been a gladiator and wondered if the individual was instead a condemned prisoner.\nDespite the disagreement, a few things are certain: The man's bones reveal that he was decapitated, possibly when he was dying or already dead. \"The decapitation of this individual was likely either to put him out of his misery at the point of death, or for the sake of conforming to customary practice,\" the authors wrote in the new study, which was published Wednesday (April 23) in the journal PLOS One.\nThe shape and depth of the bite marks found on the man's skeleton indicate that a large cat, possibly a lion, had mauled him. \"The shape is entirely consistent with documented cases of large cat bite,\" the team wrote in the paper.\nThe man, who was between 26 and 35 years old at the time of his death, was buried in a cemetery that is thought to contain the burials of other gladiators. In Roman times, the cemetery was in Eboracum, which is now the modern-day city of York, England.\nRelated: Did Roman gladiators really fight to the death?\nThe individual, who was excavated in 2004 and 2005, has two possible identities, said study co-author John Pearce, a reader in archaeology at King's College London: a trained gladiator who fought the large cat with a weapon, or a man who had been condemned to death and had fought bare-handed or while tied to a post.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nPearce thinks the likeliest scenario is that the man was a trained gladiator. \"The likelihood of this is high in this case because of the argument that the cemetery in which he is buried is one for gladiators,\" Pearce told Live Science in an email.\nThe other skeletons unearthed at the cemetery have injuries consistent with those of gladiators. \"There is evidence of healed trauma in the collection of bodies recovered from this site which suggests repeated fighting,\" study first author Timothy Thompson, vice president for students and learning at Maynooth University in Ireland, who has a background in forensic anthropology, told Live Science in an email. Moreover, many of the buried individuals were beheaded, which sometimes happened to defeated gladiators at the end of a fight, the team wrote in the paper.\nThe fight in which the man died likely would have taken place in an amphitheater in the city. \"As a major city in Britain and the home of a legion, Roman York would almost certainly have had at least one amphitheatre,\" Pearce said. However, the amphitheater's exact location is unclear.\nAlthough images of fights against beasts have been found at Roman sites and textual accounts mention these battles, there has been little anthropological evidence of them until now. This is \"the first physical evidence for human-animal gladiatorial combat from the Roman period seen anywhere in Europe,\" the team wrote in the paper.\nIn a modern experiment, researchers gave a bone to a large cat at an English zoo so they could examine its scavenging bite marks.\nA modern puncture mark on a bone left by a leopard at an English zoo.\nAnother view of the bite marks left by a large cat on bone.\nLong trip for a cat\nThe large cat would have been brought to York through a combination of sea, river and road travel, Pearce said, noting that there was \"no native big cat fauna\" in England. The large cat may have been brought all the way from North Africa.\n\"The cat would have been brought via the well-established supply routes that linked York,\" Pearce said. He noted that the rivers of continental Europe, such as the Rhine and Rhone, may have been used to move the cat. The animal would have been caged or in a crate during this journey, and it would have been difficult for its handlers to have kept it fed without getting mauled. It's not clear if the animal's handlers had some form of tranquilizer they could use.\nThere would have been a high risk of the animal dying due to the stress of the lengthy journey, Pearce noted.\nControversial conclusions\nScholars who weren't involved with the research had mixed reactions to the team's findings.\nAlfonso Ma\u00f1as, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley who has studied gladiators extensively, was doubtful about many of the team's findings. For instance, this man could not have been a gladiator, Ma\u00f1as said, because in the Roman Empire, people who fought beasts were either condemned prisoners or venatores, fighters trained to fight beasts \u2014 neither of whom were considered gladiators. Gladiator researchers are \"trying to eliminate the old mistake that gladiators fought beasts,\" Ma\u00f1as told Live Science.\nHe also noted that the tooth marks could have come from wolves, which are indigenous to Britain, rather than from a lion or other large cat. One possibility is that this man was executed through beheading and was bitten by a wolf or dog afterward, Ma\u00f1as said.\nOther researchers thought the findings presented in the article were plausible. The conclusions are \"certainly an interesting and exciting prospect,\" Jordon Houston, an honorary academic in the Department of Classical Studies and Ancient History at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, told Live Science in an email. \"Overall, this is a great article and very well researched.\"\nMike Bishop, an independent scholar who has extensively studied Roman gladiators and the Roman military, told Live Science in an email that \"the paper is certainly interesting, largely for confirming what was already suspected \u2014 that human/large animal combat occurred in the north-western provinces of the empire.\"\nMichael Carter, a professor of classics and archaeology at Brock University in Canada who has studied gladiators extensively, was generally supportive of the paper's findings. The team's analysis is \"convincing, and justifies the speculation that the person was killed by a large cat,\" Carter told Live Science in an email. \"The scenario that I imagine is most likely is that the victim had been condemned to the beasts.\"\nOwen Jarus is a regular contributor to Live Science who writes about archaeology and humans' past.

      "text": "Byzantine Empire: Map, history and facts\nThe Byzantine Empire, also called Byzantium, was the eastern half of the Roman Empire that continued on after the western half of the empire collapsed.\nThe Byzantine Empire, also known as Byzantium, refers to the eastern half of the Roman Empire that survived for nearly 1,000 years after the western half of the empire collapsed.\nThe Byzantine Empire was based at Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), and at its peak it controlled territory stretching from southern Spain to Syria.\nThroughout their history, the Byzantines rarely controlled Rome and spoke mainly Greek. Despite this, the people of Byzantium continued to refer to themselves as \"Romans,\" Timothy Gregory, professor emeritus of History at Ohio State University, wrote in the book \"A History of Byzantium\" (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010). Their broader empire was considered to be a \"Roman\" empire even though it rarely controlled Rome.\nUnlike the western half of the empire, the Byzantine Empire flourished and experienced a \"golden age\" during the reign of Justinian (A.D. 527 to 565), during which the empire's territories extended into Western Europe, and the emperor's builders constructed the Hagia Sophia, a great cathedral that still stands and is now used as a mosque.\nAfter Justinian's death, the Byzantine Empire weakened and lost territory. In 1204, during the Crusades, the Byzantines were betrayed when crusaders from the west sacked Constantinople in an attempt to gain money.\nThe Byzantine Empire eventually fell when Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1453 following a siege.\nOrigins\nBy the early fourth century A.D., the Roman Empire covered a huge territory, from northern England to Syria. However, it had become difficult to govern and rife with problems, so in A.D. 293, the emperor Diocletian introduced a system known as the tetrarchy. This effectively split the empire into four regions \u2014 two of which were ruled by emperors (augustus), and the other two ruled by each emperor's heir (caesar). Constantius (lived 250-306) was named one of these caesars and eventually rose to be augustus in the west. Upon his death in 306, the army declared his son, Constantine, as augustus.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nConstantine took control of the western half of the Roman Empire after winning the Battle of Milvian Bridge in A.D. 312 against Maxentius, a rival claimant for the western throne. Legends told during Constantine's lifetime say that before the battle, Constantine had some sort of religious experience that resulted in him warming to Christianity. In A.D. 324 Constantine became emperor of the entire Roman Empire after winning the Battle of Chrysopolis in what is now Turkey against Licinius, the emperor in the east.\nWith the empire reunited, Constantine brought in a number of important changes that laid the foundations for the Byzantine Empire.\n\"The most significant of these changes were the emergence of Christianity as the favored (and then the official) religion of the state, and the creation of Constantinople as the new urban center of the empire on the shores of the Bosphorus, midway between all the empire's frontiers,\" Gregory noted.\nConstantinople was built on the site of Byzantium, an urban center that had a long history of prior occupation. The writer Sozomen, who lived in the fifth century A.D., claimed that Constantine's choice of location for his new city was inspired by God \u2014 with God supposedly appearing before Constantine and directing him to build the city where he did.\nGregory noted that Constantine was baptized shortly before his death in A.D. 337. Constantine's death led to a series of short-lived successors. Theodosius I was the last sole Roman emperor. After his death in A.D. 395, the empire was split into two empires \u2014 east and west.\nThe fifth century would mark the end of the western half of the Roman Empire. After losing territories to so-called \"barbarian\" groups and being plagued with infighting, the Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476 when its last emperor was forced to abdicate.\nThe Eastern Roman Empire, in contrast,survived, becoming what we today call the \"Byzantine Empire,\" although its people still considered themselves \"Romans.\"\nJustinian I\nJustinian I became emperor in 527. He was the nephew and adopted son of Justin I, who had been a palace guard before usurping the throne in 518. While many historians say that Byzantium's golden age occurred during his reign, Justinian's rule didn't start off very promisingly.\nEarly in his reign, Justinian moved to further cement Christianity as the official religion of the Byzantine Empire. By the time of his accession to the throne, traditional Greco-Roman religions had been largely banned. Justinian expanded this by closing the philosophical school at Athens in 529, a place where students learned about the works of ancient Greek philosophers, such as Plato, who had followed traditional Greco-Roman religions.\nIn 532, just five years into his rule, Constantinople was hit by the Nika riots (Nika means \"victory\" or \"conquer\" in Greek). The ancient writer Procopius (who lived in the sixth century A.D.) wrote that Constantinople, along with other imperial cities, was split into two factions \u2014 the \"Blues\" and the \"Greens\" \u2014 which tended to take out their rivalry at chariot races and other events. Chariot races were hugely popular at the time and were entwined with imperial power: Justinian himself was a \"Blue,\" author James Grout wrote in the Encyclopaedia Romana.\nPrior to the unrest, Byzantine authorities arrested several members of both factions and sentenced them to be executed. This provoked supporters of the Blues and Greens, who were also angry at the high taxes Justinian had imposed. When the factions' demands for the release of the arrested members were ignored, they united and tried to overthrow the emperor.\nThe \"members of the two factions conspiring together and declaring a truce with each other, seized the prisoners and then straightway entered the prison and released all those who were in confinement there \u2026 Fire was applied to the city as if it had fallen under the hand of an enemy \u2026\" Procopius wrote.(From History of the Wars, I, xxiv, translated by H.B. Dewing, Macmillan, 1914 through the Fordham University website).\nThe riots lasted several days, and Justinian had to call in troops to put down the rioters. (Procopius wrote that 30,000 people were killed as a result.) The riots caused widespread damage, but Justinian took advantage of the situation to build something grand. At the site of a destroyed church called the Hagia Sophia (meaning \"Holy Wisdom\") he ordered a new, far grander cathedral to be built.\n\"Hagia Sophia's dimensions are formidable for any structure not built of steel,\" Helen Gardner, an art historian, and Fred Kleiner, a professor of art history at Boston University, wrote in the book \"Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A Global History\" (Cengage Learning, 2015). The replacement cathedral \" is about 270 feet [82 meters] long and 240 feet [73 meters] wide. The dome is 108 feet [33 meters] in diameter and its crown rises some 180 feet [55 meters] above the pavement,\" they wrote.\nAfter it was built, around 537, Justinian is said to have remarked, \"Solomon, I have outdone thee.\" This quote is first mentioned by writers centuries after the Hagia Sophia was built and may be apocryphal. The cathedral's great baptistry, which may have recently been uncovered by archaeologists, was the place where many Byzantine emperors were baptized.\nIn addition to building an incredible cathedral, Justinian oversaw a major territorial expansion of the empire, winning back territory in North Africa, Italy (including Rome) and parts of Western Europe.\nThe intellectual achievements of Justinian's reign were also significant. \"Art and literature flourished under his rule, and his officials carried out a remarkably thorough synthesis of Roman law that has served as the basis of the legal systems of much of Europe up to the present day,\" Gregory wrote.\nThese achievements happened despite the fact that Justinian provided little direct support for art or literature, wrote Filippomaria Pontani, a professor at the Ca' Foscari University in Venice, in the book \"History of Ancient Greek Scholarship: From the Beginnings to the End of the Byzantine Age\" (Brill, 2020).\n\"The long reign of emperor Justinian (527\u2013565) witnessed a remarkable flourishing of poets, jurists, architects and historians,\" but \"the direct patronage of Justinian in the specific field of letters was in fact rather limited,\" Pontani wrote. Additionally, a large-scale burning of books deemed to be \"pagan\" occurred in 562, Pontani noted.\nIn 541 to 542, a plague tore through Justinian's empire and even inflicted the emperor himself, although he survived. However, \"many of his compatriots did not, and some scholars have argued that as much as one-third the population of Constantinople perished,\" Gregory wrote, noting that the disease would re-occur roughly every 15 years from that moment into the seventh century.\nA food shortage brought about by cooler weather conditions occurred around the same time making matters worse. Research suggests that a piece of Halley's comet smashed into Earth in A.D. 536, which pushed so much dust into the atmosphere that the planet cooled considerably. It has also been suggested that a volcanic eruption in El Salvador contributed to this cooler climate.\nThe Byzantine Dark Age\nJustinian I died in 565. The centuries after Justinian's death are sometimes referred to as the Byzantine \"Dark Age,\" as a series of misfortunes befell the empire.\nIn the west, much of the territory that Justinian had captured was lost. By the beginning of the seventh century, \"much of Italy was under Lombard rule, Gaul was in Frankish hands and the coastal regions of Spain, the final acquisition of Justinian's re-conquest, were soon to fall to the Visigoths,\" Andrew Louth, emeritus professor of Patristic and Byzantine Studies at Durham University, wrote in a chapter of the book \"The Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire\" (Cambridge University Press, 2008).\nLouth noted that between 630 and 660, much of the empire's eastern territory, including Egypt, was conquered by Arab kingdoms, notably such as the Rashidun and Umayyad caliphates. This significantly weakened the Byzantine position. \"This radical upheaval, together with the persistent aggression of the Arabs against the remaining Byzantine lands and the incursions of Slavs and peoples hailing from the central European steppe into the Balkans, accelerated the transition of the cities of the eastern Mediterranean world that was already well underway,\" Louth wrote.\n\"By the end of the (seventh) century the cities had lost much of their social and cultural significance and survived as fortified enclaves,\" as well as markets, Louth added. \"Even Constantinople barely survived, and did so in much reduced circumstances.\"\nRecent research has uncovered evidence that even trash-disposal services were stopped in some Byzantine cities; archaeologists found that it came to an end at Elusa, in Israel, during the mid-sixth century.\nThese difficult times perhaps contributed to the iconoclasm that occurred in the eighth and ninth centuries in the Byzantine Empire. During this period, much Byzantine religious artwork was destroyed.\nByzantine comeback?\nByzantium never returned to the \"golden age\" it had experienced during Justinian's rule. Nevertheless, the military situation stabilized in the ninth century, and by the 11th century, Byzantium had regained a considerable amount of territory that it had lost.\nBy the time of Emperor Basil II's death in December 1025, after a reign of almost 50 years, Byzantium was \"the dominant power of the Balkans and Middle East, with apparently secure frontiers along the Danube, in the Armenian highlands and beyond the Euphrates,\" Michael Angold, professor emeritus at the University of Edinburgh, wrote in another chapter of \"The Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire.\" Additionally, the Byzantines succeeded in spreading Christianity to Russia.\nHowever, this comeback of sorts was tenuous to say the least. \"Fifty years later, Byzantium was struggling for its existence. All its frontiers were breached,\" Angold wrote. By this time, nomads were entering Turkey and the Danube provinces, while the Normans had seized the Byzantine Empire's Italian territories.\nNevertheless, the empire eventually regained some semblance of stability once again and continued on.\nThe Great Schism of 1054\nOn July 16, 1054, a papal legate (representative) named Humbert of Silva Candida excommunicated the Patriarch of Constantinople Michael I Cerularius. At the time Pope Leo IX had recently died and a new pope had not been selected. The patriarch refused to relinquish power and excommunicated Humbert in return. This resulted in a schism breaking out between the church at Constantinople and the church in Rome.\nMichael I Cerularius had brought in rules stating that all churches in Constantinople should follow Greek customs - even those whose worshippers had many members from western Europe, wrote Philip Kennedy, a Senior Research Fellow in theology at Mansfield College at the University of Oxford in his book \"Christianity: An Introduction\" (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2011). This annoyed Pope Leo IX who sent legates led by Humbert to Constantinople with a letter of protest against his actions. Cerularius refused to meet these legates and after Pope Leo IX died Humbert decided to excommunicate Cerularius wrote Kennedy.\nA number of differences in customs had built up between western churches and Greek churches over the centuries. For instance the churches in Rome used unleavened bread whereas the Greek churches tended to use leavened bread. There were also differences in how the Nicene Creed - a statement of faith - should be worded. There were also differences in priestly celibacy - with Greek churches allowing married priests.\nKennedy noted that in the early 11th century when the Normans invaded Sicily they forced Greeks living on the island to adopt religious customs used in Rome, something that annoyed church officials in Constantinople including Cerularius.\nThe Fourth Crusade\nIn 1204, an army of crusaders from the west sacked Constantinople and installed a short-lived line of rulers.\nThe idea of Christians crusading against other Christians was strange even by the standards of the Middle Ages. There are a number of reasons why it came to this. The Great Schism of 1054 and the subsequent decades of separation between the Orthodox Church and the church in Rome was a significant factor, wrote John Giebfried, an assistant professor of history at East Georgia State College and Kyle Lincoln, a special lecturer at Oakland University, in their book \"The Remaking of the Medieval World, 1204 The Fourth Crusade\" (University of North Carolina Press, 2021). Another important factor is that people from the west were massacred in Constantinople in 1182, Giebfried and Lincoln wrote.\nThis meant that in 1203, a number of cash-strapped crusaders who were looking for money to finance a military expedition to Egypt were willing to hear out Alexius Angelos, a claimant to the Byzantine throne who encouraged the crusaders to journey to Constantinople.\nAlexius Angelos promised the crusaders that if \"they helped to reinstate him in Constantinople he would pay them 200,000 marks, give them all the supplies they needed and provide an army of 10,000 men. He would also place the Greek Orthodox Church under the authority of the papacy,\" Jonathan Phillips, a professor at the Royal Holloway University of London, wrote in an article in History Today in 2004.\nPhillips noted that by this time, the Byzantine military was in bad shape. \"The death of Emperor Manuel Comnenus (1143-80) presaged a series of regencies, usurpations and coups. Between 1180 and 1204 no fewer than fifty-eight rebellions or uprisings took place across the empire.\"\nThe crusaders succeeded in taking Constantinople in 1204;, they sacked the city and installed a new line of \"Latin\" kings from the west on the Byzantine throne. These rulers would remain in place until a Greek general named Michael Palaeologus re-took Constantinople and crowned himself Michael VIII in1261 (he went on to rule until 1282).\nThe end of the Byzantine Empire\nWhile Constantinople was once again under control of a Greek ruler, its end was drawing near. The empire struggled on into the 15th century, but the emperors gradually lost their importance in favor of religious officials.\nIn 1395, Patriarch Anthony, the Patriarch of Constantinople, felt the need to give a speech explaining why the Byzantine emperor was still important. \"The holy emperor has a great place in the church, for he is not like other rulers or governors of other regions. This is so because from the beginning the emperors established and confirmed the [true] faith in all the inhabited world\u2026\" he said.(From the book Byzantium: Church Society, and Civilization Seen through Contemporary Eyes, University of Chicago Press, 1984, through Fordham University website)\nIn 1453, the Ottoman Empire, which had been expanding into Byzantine territory since the 14th century, besieged and captured Constantinople, putting an end to the Byzantine Empire. Today, although the Byzantine Empire is long gone, the city of Constantinople (now called Istanbul) flourishes and is still regarded as a crossroads, both literally and metaphorically, between Europe and Asia.\nThis article was updated on May 10, 2022, by Live Science contributor Owen Jarus.\nAdditional resources\nThe Byzantine Empire's warriors fought many battles.

      "text": "Archaeologists discover rare liquid gypsum burial of 'high-status individual' from Roman Britain\nA Roman-era cemetery, found ahead of a construction project in England, holds an unusual burial at its center.\nArchaeologists in England have discovered a Roman-era cemetery with an unusual burial at its center \u2014 a stone coffin holding a deceased individual encased in liquid gypsum.\nThis practice is known from Roman times, but archaeologists still don't fully understand it. The mineral was made into a cement or plaster and then poured over the deceased person to make a hard cast. This process sometimes preserved organic remnants such as clothing or a burial shroud. The gypsum from the newfound burial is fragmentary, but it retains impressions of the individual's shroud and preserved a small piece of fabric.\nThis type of burial is largely known from Roman urban centers \u2014 such as York in England, which has 45 documented gypsum burials \u2014 but it's rare to find them in rural regions, as this one was. In this case, \"we do believe this would have been an expensive endeavour and is therefore indicative of a high-status individual,\" said Jessica Lowther, community archaeologist for Headland Archaeology, the company that did the excavation.\nThe gypsum was artfully carved and came from a quarry about 30 miles (50 kilometers) away from the site, and it would have cost a big sum to purchase and transport, according to a statement from Headland Archaeology. These factors, combined with the grave's central location in the cemetery, indicate that the person buried there was elite or part of a prominent family.\nWhile no grave goods were found in the coffin, archaeologists did find a glass vessel nearby that may have once held a libation, or toast for the deceased, according to the statement.\nRelated: 'Liquid gypsum' burial from Roman Britain scanned in 3D, revealing 1,700-year-old secrets\nArchaeologists found the cemetery ahead of construction work that aims to widen a highway in Cambridgeshire. The cemetery dates to the Roman period in Britain (A.D. 42 to 410).\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nA glass vessel was the only grave good found by the gypsum burial.\nA burial from the Roman-era cemetery in which the individual's skull was placed at their feet.\nThe cemetery sat along an ancient Roman road. During the excavation, the team found 14 graves around the central gypsum burial and unearthed seven more beyond a boundary ditch.\nCuriously, the cemetery had a variety of burial types, which is uncommon for such a small burial ground. These included cist burials, which are lined with long stones; cremation burials; decapitation burials; burials with iron nails, which hint at the presence of a wooden coffin; and even an empty grave, according to the statement.\nBurials from both inside and beyond the boundary ditch had prominent grave goods, including jewelry. One burial, southwest of the gypsum grave, had a large pile of grave goods at the buried individual's feet. This person died between the ages of 16 and 20 and was female, a bone analysis found.\nA copper alloy bangle that archaeologists found in the grave of a young woman.\nA cist burial that archaeologists unearthed at the Roman cemetery.\n\"One theory as to why she was buried with this cache at her feet instead of wearing it is that it could have been meant for her dowry,\" Lowther told Live Science in an email. \"Among these grave goods were a beautiful pair of silver earrings, nine copper alloy bracelets, three copper alloy rings, and a silver band and oval plate, thought to be the shank and bezel of a signet ring.\"\nAnother burial with grave goods, located beyond the boundary ditch, belonged to a child. This youth's grave had 10 copper alloy bracelets, four bone bracelets, a bone comb and also a pair of silver earrings that were \"remarkably like those from the burial of the young woman,\" Lowther said.\nBut their similarity doesn't mean the two individuals are related, as \"this also could be the style of a distinctive local craftsperson,\" she noted.\nSpecialists plan to study the remains, which \"will hopefully be able to untangle the questions surrounding the longevity of the cemetery and how it fits into the surrounding landscape, as well as shedding some light on the individual stories of those buried here,\" Lowther said.\nLaura is the archaeology and Life's Little Mysteries editor at Live Science. She also reports on general science, including paleontology. Her work has appeared in The New York Times, Scholastic, Popular Science and Spectrum, a site on autism research.
