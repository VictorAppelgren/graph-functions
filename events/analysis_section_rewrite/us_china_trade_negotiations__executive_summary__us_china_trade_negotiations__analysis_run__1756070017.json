      "feedback": "Strong scaffold, but tighten for a world‑class brief: collapse the draft into 4–6 crisp lines, each tethered to a single primary source ID and with explicit transitions between Regime 1–3; map every claim to core anchors (e.g., 0UOO8VW2V, KFTWPFGAF, SGB2PAZGK for regime framing; D5M2JYKVS for near‑term tariff/licensing signals; I35H3FBSN for Intel governance/54-week timing; M6M4LNMC4 for governance risk and Apple risk backdrop) and reconcile any conflicts rather than listing sources ad hoc; replace the sprawling causal narration with a principled first‑principles chain: policy action alters capex timing in domestic silicon/AI infra, which reprices suppliers/credit and shifts macro risk premia that drive multiples, discount rates, and onshore margins; quantify the house view with explicit numbers from the material (60–70% base Regime 2, 20–30% Regime 3; 10% baseline/30% top line tariffs; circa 2.6% S&P futures move; Intel ~10% equity stake) and clearly label the range and uncertainty; restructure the near‑term horizon into concrete catalysts and invalidation points (export‑control list expansions; Nvidia licensing outcomes; Intel governance terms; clear 0–14/14–42/42–90 day milestones) and tighten the watchlist to 2–3 items per window; purge repetition and hedging language, ensure 4–6 sentences/bullets total, and explicitly indicate where each assertion is sourced to avoid cross‑source ambiguity.",
