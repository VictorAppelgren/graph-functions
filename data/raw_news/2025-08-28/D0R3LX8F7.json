He noted that easing \u201cmay\u201d be appropriate, given that monetary policy is still in \u201crestrictive territory\u201d at a time when the risk of a weaker labor market can materialize \u201cquickly\u201d and inflationary expectations are well-anchored enough to handle temporary tariff-induced price increases. Markets reacted by dialing up the probability of a September rate cut to nearly 90% \u2014 though much still depends on the next set of employment reports.",
