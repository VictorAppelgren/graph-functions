      "feedback": "The analysis draft demonstrates a solid understanding of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it could benefit from enhanced clarity and depth in several areas. First, strengthen the causal chain by explicitly linking how inflationary pressures from tariffs impact consumer behavior and the Fed's decision-making process. Incorporate specific quantitative data to support assertions, such as the exact percentage of expected rate cuts or historical comparisons to similar economic conditions. Ensure that the discussion aligns with the multi-year horizon focus by articulating potential long-term implications of current trends, including the structural shifts in the economy and labor market. Additionally, refine the conclusion by clearly delineating the base case scenario, key risks, and specific catalysts to watch, ensuring that each point is grounded in the analysis provided. Lastly, improve citation density by integrating more references to the source material throughout the analysis to bolster credibility and allow for easier verification of claims.",
