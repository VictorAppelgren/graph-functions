  "title": "Are Bentley Systems, Incorporated (NASDAQ:BSY) Investors Paying Above The Intrinsic Value?",
  "description": "Key Insights The projected fair value for Bentley Systems is US$40.30 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Bentley...",
  "content": "\u2022 The projected fair value for Bentley Systems is US$40.30 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\u2022 Bentley Systems is estimated to be 35% overvalued based on current share price of US$54.30\n\u2022 Analyst price target for BSY is US$59.08, which is 47% above our fair value estimate Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Bentley Systems, Incorporated (NASDAQ:BSY) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.8b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 3.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.6%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$18b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$7.8b The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$13b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$54.3, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Bentley Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.197. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. See our latest analysis for Bentley Systems\n\u2022 Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\u2022 Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\n\u2022 Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\u2022 Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\u2022 Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market. Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value? For Bentley Systems, there are three fundamental factors you should explore:\n\u2022 Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Bentley Systems , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.\n\u2022 Future Earnings: How does BSY's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling.

  "argos_summary": "Bentley Systems (NASDAQ:BSY) is currently trading above its intrinsic value, with a discounted cash flow fair value of $40.30 versus a market price of $54.30\u2014about 35% overvalued. Analysts project a 12\u2011month target of $59.08, reflecting expectations of continued earnings growth, but the company\u2019s high P/E of 67.2x versus the software industry average of 35.9x signals premium pricing. The valuation model uses a 10\u2011year cash\u2011flow projection and a terminal growth rate tied to the 5\u2011year U.S. Treasury yield, discounting at 8.6%. Investors should weigh the overvaluation against the company\u2019s strong earnings growth outlook and low debt profile before deciding on a position.",
