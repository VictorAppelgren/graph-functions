  "title": "Why I'm recommending this Google Pixel 10 model to most people (and don't regret it)",
  "description": "With enhanced features and a better camera, the Pixel 10 raises the bar for entry-level handsets in 2025.",
  "content": "\u2022 The Google Pixel 10 packs the Tensor G5 chipset, a new telephoto lens, and other long-awaited hardware upgrades.\n\u2022 On the software side, the Google Pixel 10's AI suite can predict your needs, edit photos for you, and more.\n\u2022 While packing all of these upgrades, the Pixel 10 still retails for $799.\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nAs summer draws to a close and Techtember nears, Google is kicking off the transition with its Made by Google event this week. One of the major releases at the event is Google's latest entry-level flagship device, the Pixel 10 -- and out of the entire Pixel 10 Series, it's the device to keep an eye on.\n\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\n\nWhile the Pixel 10 is the company's baseline model, after spending hands-on time with all the new devices ahead of launch, I can confidently say it's the best fit for most users. Why? The Pixel 10 packs highly anticipated upgrades, such as a better camera, battery, and chipset (which supports a plethora of new and exciting AI features), all at the same $799 price point as its predecessor.\n\nHere are my first impressions and a round-up of what makes this phone a solid option.\n\nThe traditional compact and sleek feel of the Pixel baseline models continues with the Pixel 10, which sports similar dimensions and weight (a mere 0.2 ounces heavier) as its predecessor and feels just as comfortable in the palm of your hand.\n\nWith rounded corners, aluminum sides, a smooth Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 back (also featured on the front), and a camera bar, the device maintains the same aesthetic as the Pixel 9 while also sporting fun new phone colors.\n\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\n\nWhile the new lineup includes the Obsidian color from prior years' releases, the phone also comes in new colors: Indigo, a bright blue color similar to Apple's Ultramarine color for the iPhone 16; Indigo, a white shade with a subtle blue undertone; and Lemongrass, a vibrant yellow-lime shade.\n\nThe glassy finish provides a nice sheen on the exterior, but if you mind smudges, you may want to watch out. Like last year, the phones still feature an IP68 rating for durability against water and dust.\n\nThe displays got a facelift for a better viewing experience in indoor and outdoor settings, across both productivity and entertainment activities. The 6.3-inch Actua display now supports up to 3000 nits of peak brightness (up from last year's 2700 nits), and keeps the buttery smooth 120Hz refresh rate, 2424x1080 resolution, and OLED panel found on the Pixel 9.\n\n2. Most capable camera system yet on a base Pixel\n\nOne of the biggest upgrades of the Pixel 10 is its camera system, which is the best on any base Pixel. The phone features a new 5x telephoto lens, which enables a wider optical zoom range, with a Super Res zoom up to 20x. In practice, this capability means that the phone is better when cropping in close on a subject, even from a distance, helping you capture crisper shots while maximizing the zoom. This feature set also closes the gap between the base and Pro phones even further.\n\nAlso: Google just settled the foldable phone debate with one number -- and I hope Samsung is watching\n\nThe triple camera array replaces the dual camera system, featuring a 48MP main camera, a 13MP 120-degree ultrawide, and a new 10.8MP telephoto lens. If you were hoping for an upgrade from the lower-quality front camera, you'll have to wait until the next model, as the Pixel 10 keeps last year's 10.5MP selfie camera. It's not bad, but also not the best.\n\nWhile the addition of a third lens meant a downgrade in the sensors' specs compared to those of the previous year's model, the camera's Imaging Signal Processor (ISP), enabled by the new Tensor G5 chipset, is set to improve the photo quality. Google promises this setup delivers Pixel's \"best image and video quality yet.\"\n\nAlso: Changing these 10 settings on my Pixel phone greatly improved the user experience\n\nWhen taking photos in the demo room, I was satisfied with the crispness and quality of the shots from both the front and back cameras. To truly judge how well the Pixel 10 does in different light conditions, I will have to wait for my in-depth testing. In addition to the actual camera upgrades, the photo-taking software received the bulk of AI upgrades, which will likely boost your photo-taking and editing experience, resulting in overall better picture quality.\n\nThe Pixel 10 features an expansive suite of AI features, all enabled by the new Tensor G5 chipset. The processor was designed for Gemini and is Google's most AI-optimized chipset yet, with a TPU that is up to 60% more powerful and a CPU that is 34% faster, according to Google.\n\nWhile we'll have to test the phone in the real world to gauge performance, the chipset supports computational enhancements on the Pixel 10, such as the ISP upgrades discussed above, a longer battery life (30 hours), and improved experiences when using AI features.\n\nAlso: 7 Google Pixel phone settings you should change immediately (and how to do it)\n\nOn-device processing is a win for users as it not only allows them to experience faster speeds when using AI features by avoiding cloud-based processing, but also provides privacy, as all of their information stays on the device. The Tensor G5 can run Google's Gemini Nano model on-device, a powerful model that supports the extensive suite of AI features that are sprinkled across nearly every phone function, from the camera to texts and phone calls.\n\nAs with every device launch from the last year, Google's new hardware is accompanied by a ton of new AI features. While most tech companies are in a race where they release similar features to keep up with their rivals, I was impressed that Google managed to include some truly original features that should add value to some users' lives.\n\nA perfect example is the new Camera Coach feature, which, as its name implies, uses AI to help you get the perfect shot. The feature gives step-by-step instructions and even generates a sample image of what you should aim for in the final picture. Some of the feedback includes correcting your angle, lighting, and more.\n\nAlso: I upgraded to Android 16 - here's what I love and what's still missing\n\nOther new features include: Edit with Ask Photos, which allows you to use natural language prompts to edit something out of an image, such as removing reflection; Magic Cue, which can anticipate your needs and suggest relevant information and actions based on what you are doing on your phone; and a new Daily Hub feature, which puts all the information you need in one place, including AI-powered insights about your day. Even older features, such as Best Take and Add Me, have received a boost.\n\nGoogle might trickle these experiences down to older models via a software update. However, the company may choose to keep these features exclusive to the Tensor G5 chipset due to processing demands or as an incentive to upgrade.\n\nIf you have ever looked at an iPhone user with MagSafe envy, Google has finally brought the same experience to Pixel phones via its new Pixelsnap magnetic technology. Pixelsnap allows users to attach their phones to compatible magnetic accessories, including chargers, mounts, docks, and more, unlocking new experiences with their phones.\n\nWhen this functionality is paired with the Qi2 wireless charging support available on the Pixel 10, users can take advantage of the full glory of fast wireless charging.\n\nAlso: PixelSnap is the MagSafe for Android phones we've been waiting for - here's our first look\n\nGoogle also launched a Pixelsnap Charger with Stand and a Pixelsnap Ring Stand, which allow users to prop their phones up for a hands-free experience. This approach is ideal for viewing movies, scrolling on social media, video calls, and more.\n\nEven if you don't want to purchase the accessories, they work with existing MagSafe accessories, so there are thousands of products already on the market that now work with Pixel phones.",

      "text": "Gemini just got two of ChatGPT's best features - and they're free\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Gemini can now remember chat context for personalized answers.\n- Users can use Temporary Chat for added privacy.\n- Google also added new data control settings you'll want to look at now.\nYou can now reference your past chats with Google's Gemini AI chatbot for more personalized responses, the company said Wednesday. Google also added a Temporary Chat feature and new data control settings. Everyone, including free users, can take advantage of the features in the Gemini app.\nAlso: You can try Gemini Live in your favorite Google apps now, and it blew me away\nWhile every major AI company is constantly racing to release the latest and greatest AI models, sometimes the most impactful updates are actually the less flashy features that improve the chatbot using experience. These new Gemini features aim to make users' lives easier in ways ChatGPT already has.\nKeep reading below to find out how to access the features (and if you should).\nMore personalized responses\nAI is only as helpful as the information it is given. As a result, prompt engineering -- or creating a prompt for a chatbot that has as much specific information as possible to make it produce a higher-quality response -- is a huge part of using a chatbot successfully. However, this can often be a time-consuming process, especially if you're working on something longer-term; re-explaining your context every time can be tedious.\nAlso: GPT-5 was meant to cut choices, but OpenAI just added multiple modes - why?\nNow, Gemini can reference your past conversations to learn more about you over time and produce more personalized answers. All this means is that if you shared details about your preferences or your life, Gemini can then reference those details in your future response.\nFor example, if I disclose I have a 15-pound Yorkie in one conversation, and in another I ask what games I should play with my dog, it will already take into account his breed and weight without me having to repeat myself. It works the same way as ChatGPT's Memory feature, which rolled out in April. Anthropic's Claude also got the capability this week.\nThe feature is being rolled out to users in the coming weeks, beginning today. Google shares that the experience is first limited to the 2.5 Pro model in select countries, and that it will expand the feature to 2.5 Flash in the weeks ahead.\nAlso: Why Perplexity is going after Google Chrome - and yes, it's serious\nIt is important to note that the feature is on by default, but if you don't want Gemini to remember or reference your past conversations, you can turn the setting off in your Settings. To do so, in the Gemini app, visit \"Settings,\" \"Personal context,\" and \"Your past chats with Gemini,\" where you can toggle the setting on and off, as seen in the image below.\nSpecific interactions with the chatbot can also be managed and deleted from your conversations in Gemini Apps Activity. More on that below.\nTemporary Chat\nTemporary Chat is one of my favorite features in ChatGPT, and now it is finally available in Gemini. The feature is simple: whenever you want to have a conversation with Gemini that you don't want it to recall at a later date or be saved to your history, all you have to do is click the Temporary Chat icon next to \"New chat.\"\nAlso: Don't like GPT-5? You can still use GPT-4 and other legacy models in ChatGPT - here's how\nIt is the same concept behind turning on Incognito mode in Google Chrome or Private Window in Safari.\nWhen Temporary Chat is on, your conversation won't appear in your recent chats or Gemini Apps Activity, meaning it will not be used to train Google's AI models. The downside is that it won't be used to personalize your Gemini experience (the feature listed above), but it does give you peace of mind that your conversation isn't going to be referenced.\nThe feature is also rolling out today and will be available all users in the coming weeks.\nNew data control settings\nIn the upcoming weeks, Google will rename the \"Gemini Apps Activity\" to \"Keep Activity.\" When this setting is toggled on, a sample of your uploads, starting on September 2, will be used to \"help improve Google services for everyone.\" If you don't want your data used that way, you can turn off the setting or use the Temporary Chats option. For instructions on how to turn the setting off, you can visit Google's step-by-step guide.\nIf you currently have your \"Gemini Apps Activity\" off, even when the switch to \"Keep Activity\" happens, it will stay off. As a result, if privacy means a lot to you, I would recommend making the switch now."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\n7 Google Pixel phone settings you should change immediately (and how to do it)\nIf you just bought a new Google Pixel phone, or are planning to buy one in the near future, there's a handful of settings that you should know about before you venture out with your newfound pocket companion.\nAlso: I changed this Android setting to instantly double my phone speed\nModifying some of these settings will be up to your personal taste, but all of them will generally improve the performance and reliability of your Pixel phone. Who wouldn't want that?\nSee below for the list of the key changes I always make when setting up a Google Pixel, including why each one is significant and how you can do the same with your own device.\n1. Double the speed via Developer Options\nTo start, let's tweak the one setting that will make every other task on this list faster to complete: Dialing up your phone's animations. We're basically allowing the Pixel to run all of its animations, from opening and closing apps to bringing down the notification panel, in double time. Here's how.\nOpen your settings > scroll down to About phone > find the Build number (which should be at the very bottom of the list) > and tap the tile seven times. A message should pop up saying that Developer Options is now turned on.\nAlso: You can now use Gemini in Google Messages, if you're among the lucky few\nGo back to your main settings list > tap on System > Developer Options > and then scroll down until you find the animation scale tiles. Tap on each one and adjust the value from 1x to .5x. This means that all of your phone animations will now take half of the time to execute.\n2. Turn on Smooth Display\nLast year's $499 7a made it clear that high refresh rates are becoming the new norm. Sort of. While even mid-range Pixel phones now sport at least 90Hz displays, the smoother refresh rate is not always turned on by default. Here's how to flip the switch.\nAlso: Leak reveals the Pixel 8a's specs, with big upgrades on the way\nOpen up your settings > tap on Display > and then toggle on Smooth Display. While Smooth Display follows an adaptive approach to refreshing the frames on your phone, meaning they'll cycle between 60Hz and 90Hz (or 120Hz if you're on a Pixel 8 Pro) depending on what task you're doing or how much battery is left, the visual experience will be noticeably more pleasing to the eyes than what you had at the start.\n3. A power button that serves its purpose\nDid you know that a press-and-hold of the power button (right side key) doesn't actually give you the power off prompt? Instead, Google's voice assistant appears, which is fine, but also not what you may be after. Let's change that.\nGo into your settings, tap on the System tab, Gestures, and then Press & hold power button. Switch the action from Digital assistant to Power menu.\n4. Personalize Quick Settings menu\nWhether this is your first time using a Google Pixel, or an Android phone in general, do yourself a favor and get familiar with the Quick Settings menu. You can access it by swiping down from the top of the screen. The Quick Settings menu, as the name implies, presents you with a layout of one-tap shortcuts, including access to Wi-Fi connections, Bluetooth, alarms, location services, and more.\nYou can modify this list of toggles by tapping on the pencil icon when you expand the list of Quick Settings. Then, simply drag and drop shortcuts, remove the ones you don't need, and position the toggles to your liking.\nAlso: Why Google's $499 Pixel 8 is the best phone deal right now\nAs a bonus tip, it never hurts to set a timed Night Light -- think digital blue light filter -- for when you're using your phone before bed. Tap and hold the Night Light Quick Settings toggle to open its full settings > set the filter intensity (the stronger, the warmer-toned the display gets) > then set a schedule.\n5. Turn off the annoying gestures\nAlright, not all the default gestures are annoying, but they're mostly turned on by default and can be unnecessary. When you first set up a Google Pixel, you'll find the following list of active gestures by going to your settings > System > Gestures:\n- Quickly open camera\n- Flip camera for selfie\n- Tap to check phone\n- Lift to check phone\nAgain, you might find every one of those useful and choose to keep them on. Personally, I turn off Lift to check phone, since I can do without a waking screen every time I pick up my device. Doing so prevents the phone's motion sensor from staying active, which should help with battery life -- even if it's to a small extent.\n6. Unleash fast charging\nComing from a Samsung Galaxy and OnePlus phone, my most recent testing of the Google Pixel 8 series left me unsatisfied with its charging speed. Part of the reason was that Google capped the device's charging rate at 30W. The second was because the Pixel had Adaptive Charging turned on to begin with.\nReview: Google Pixel 8 Pro: Five months later, still the AI phone to beat in 2024\nJust so I'm not burning any bridges with battery preservationists, Adaptive Charging is a good feature to have. It tells the Pixel to purposely slow down charging when you're not using the phone as much, like during your sleep or a commute, to prevent the battery from burning out as quickly.\nHowever, at a time when we're so reliant on our phones, the normal, faster-charging pace is often needed. To reap the benefits of every 30W (or 18W for Pixel A series devices) of power, open your settings > tap on Battery > Adaptive preferences > and then toggle off Adaptive Charging.\n7. Use Adaptive alert vibration\nIt's one thing to turn off the ringer when you set your phone on your work desk and another to keep the notifications from vibrating your device to oblivion. Starting with the Pixel 7a, Google introduced a sound feature called Adaptive alert vibration.\nAlso: 5 reasons you should update your Google Pixel phone ASAP\nThe way it works is simple: When the Pixel is left face up and unmoved, incoming notifications will trigger a lighter vibration than usual, with the intention of being less distracting.\nYou can turn on the feature by going to the Sound & Vibration settings menu > tapping Vibration & haptics > and then turning on Adaptive alert vibration."

I had just wrapped up testing Samsung's $1,900 foldable phone, and Google all but confirmed the new Pixel phones would look identical to last year's, spoiling the surprise ahead of this week's event.\nThe question I had going in was simple: Was this a lack of ambition or a sign of unwavering confidence?\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nIt took only minutes of hands-on time to find the answer -- and realize just how wrong I was about which Pixel model I would actually want this year. No, the designers at Google haven't run out of ideas for decorating a glass rectangle; instead, they've improved something that was already great. And one model in particular left the biggest impression on me.\nThe Pixel 10 just barely missed the mark\nGoing into the Made by Google event, I was fully prepared to slap my wallet down for the standard Pixel 10 model, ending a seven-year streak of buying the XL/Pro variant. The writing was on the wall: A dedicated telephoto lens would give the base Pixel the camera bump it needed to rival its Pro siblings, Qi2 wireless charging with integrated magnets set the stage for Android's MagSafe moment, and a charming Indigo color (pictured above) had my caseless habits drooling.\nBut a closer examination of the device and its spec sheet revealed some not-so-obvious shortcomings. First, fitting a dedicated telephoto lens into the rear camera bar meant that Google had to downgrade to smaller main and ultrawide sensors, resulting in camera samples that, based on my albeit limited sample size, lacked color accuracy and contrast compared to the Pro models.\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but Google just sold me on the Pixel 10 with these features\nGoogle is also launching a new dock mode that passively displays the time, weather, photos, and even smart home controls when the Pixel 10 is mounted on the new PixelSnap charging mount. However, the standard Pixel 10 lacks the LTPO technology -- which allows the display to refresh from 1Hz to 120Hz -- found on the Pro models, meaning it's less power efficient when docked.\nBy the end of my Pixel 10 demo, the glossy back cover of my Indigo unit was plastered with fingerprint marks -- a gentle reminder of why the most expensive phones on the market opt for satin finishes instead of shiny glass.\nI almost folded for this Pixel model\nThat left me with the Pixel 10 Pro phones, including a Fold model that features slimmer front screen bezels, a larger battery, the same Qi2 charging as the Pixel 10, and a $1,799 price tag that makes you think twice. Coming from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which greatly improved in lightness and ergonomics this year, I was fully prepared for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to feel outdated.\nInstead, the device felt balanced and, frankly, much more durable in the hand. Google's done something extravagant with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold; it's the first foldable phone ever to be certified with an IP68 rating, making it both water- and dust-resistant. Why has this never been done before? The mechanical nature of foldable phones, with all their hinge systems and rail maneuvers, makes it nearly impossible to fend off dust-sized particles.\nAlso: Google just settled the foldable phone debate with one number - and I hope Samsung is watching\nAchieving this engineering feat automatically puts the Pixel 10 Pro Fold ahead of the competition when it comes to longevity and reliability. (Again, the designers at Google are clearly not out of ideas.)\nThen came the bad news. Like previous years, Google's most expensive hardware product is a tier below the Pro and Pro XL models when it comes to general specs like camera and charging, a choice that makes the Pro Fold a tough sell against more capable, non-folding flagships. This model also charges at up to 30W wired and 15W wireless, compared to the Pro XL's 45W wired and 25W wireless.\nThat leaves two, and one big difference\nGoogle has kept the feature parity between its Pro and Pro XL models fairly balanced over the years, and from a bird's-eye view, that remains true in 2025. But then you start to notice the minor ways in which the XL model pulls ahead and wonder if the gap has ever been larger.\nLike with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, charging and endurance are the most notable differences between the Pro and Pro XL. The latter has both a larger battery (5,200mAh vs. 4,870mAh) and faster wired and wireless charging. It's also the only Pixel model this year to support the new Qi2.5 standard, allowing it to pull in wireless energy at a 25W rating.\nI've also found the Pro XL model's larger 6.8-inch screen more optimal for Google's various new AI features, whether it's for displaying Magic Cues in messages and phone calls, or photo tips when Camera Coach is turned on, cementing it as the phone I'll likely upgrade to this summer."

At its Made by Google hardware event thi sweek, the company unveiled its new Pixel 10 Pro Fold, a $1,799 foldable phone that's the first of its kind to feature an IP68 rating.\nThose two digits -- especially the first one -- are really important, whether you're a frequent beach goer or often find a pile of dust and debris when you pull your phone out of your pocket. An IP68 rating represents the device's Ingress Protection code, a compliance standard for how well it can resist water and dust.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nWhile foldable phones like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 have long offered water resistance (IPX8), their vulnerability to dust and small particles has made many consumers hesitant to commit -- especially at premium prices. That's why the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's IP68 rating is as noteworthy as it is.\nThe enhanced durability should greatly reduce the likelihood of the phone being damaged by everyday wear, particle intrusion, and more. An IP68 rating also puts the Pixel 10 Pro Fold in the same protection level as traditional slab phones -- it's quite the feat considering how difficult it is to design a device with moving parts that also withstand dust and debris.\nAlso: The best flip phones of 2025: Where does the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 stand?\nGoogle says the Pixel 10 Pro Fold features a remodeled hinge, with a gearless, high-strength beam system made from spacecraft-grade materials. You're looking at a foldable phone that's advertised to withstand more than 10 years of folding.\nThe redesigned interior also gave room for Google to squeeze in a larger 5,010mAh battery (up from last year's 4,650mAh) as well as magnetic adapters for PixelSnap accessories -- think MagSafe for Android.\nAlso: Finally, Pixel 10 ends Android's MagSafe envy with its new PixelSnap feature\nHow significant is the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's durability upgrade to you? Does the IP68 rating make it a more enticing option than other foldable phones? Sound off in the comments below.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "Gemini Nano is coming to the Pixel 8 after all, along with two new AI features\nWhen Google first announced Gemini Nano, the company made its AI model designed for mobile devices a big selling point for the Pixel 8 Pro. After initially blaming hardware limitations for leaving out the base Pixel 8 model, Google has now found a way to give Gemini Nano to Pixel 8 users after all.\nGoogle confirmed today that its on-device AI model will be headed to the Pixel 8 in the next Pixel Feature Drop, which should arrive in June \u2013 in developer preview mode. That means any Pixel 8 user can access Gemini Nano by simply turning it on in the Developer options. Gemini Nano will almost certainly come to the wider Pixel 8 audience eventually, but for now, it'll be reserved for testing only.\nAlso: What is Gemini? Everything you should know about Google's new AI model\nGemini Nano will power two new features on the Pixel 8 that were previously exclusive to the Pixel 8 Pro.\nFirst, the Recorder app is getting a Summarize feature that can generate a few bullet points based on an audio recording's transcript. This should make Recorder fantastic for taking meeting notes: just tap the Summarize button once a meeting recording is finished.\nThe second feature will be Gboard Smart Reply, which Google says allows for higher quality smart replies that include conversational awareness. On the Pixel 8 Pro, that feature works with WhatsApp, Line, and Kakao Talk.\nWhen Google introduced Gemini Nano, a lot of Pixel 8 users felt left out. Google blamed the Pixel 8 for having less RAM compared to the Pixel 8 Pro. Since Gemini Nano runs locally on the device, Google was worried about the quality of the Gemini experience.\nThat said, both of Google's phones are powered by the same Tensor G3 chipset. Furthermore, Samsung managed to get Gemini Nano on the Galaxy S24 series, the entry model of which has 8GB of RAM, just like the Pixel 8."

Google's latest Pixel 10 Pro phone has an upgraded Tensor G5 processor, which makes it more powerful than any Pixel phone ever. If you have an older Pixel, you may wonder if the new flagship is worth the upgrade and why.\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but Google just sold me on the Pixel 10 with these features\nThe Pixel 10 lineup is the first to get Pixelsnap wireless charging, which is Google's response to Apple's MagSafe on the iPhone. While older Pixel phones supported wireless charging, the Pixelsnap features strong magnets to hold accessories like a battery pack or wallet.\nThis is just one of the many changes coming with the Pixel 10 Pro. Here's how the new flagship compares to previous models, including the Pixel 9 Pro, 8 Pro, 7 Pro, and 6 Pro.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 9 Pro\nThe Pixel 10 Pro's biggest upgrade is its performance, as it features a pretty significant performance boost compared to the 9 Pro. The new Google Tensor G5 processor features a more efficient 3nm process node and can deliver up to 36% faster performance than the Pixel 9 Pro. Both models have the same camera 50MP main camera, a 48MP ultrawide camera, and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens camera.\nAlso: Google Pixel phones just got a major Bluetooth connectivity upgrade - why 6.0 is such a big deal\nIf you have a Google Pixel 9 Pro, you may find that the new 10 Pro doesn't show much of a physical change. The current flagship has some new features, but it's more of an iterative upgrade to the previous model than anything else, with almost identical dimensions and a similar design.\nIf you're wondering whether upgrading to a Pixel 10 Pro from the previous model, the magnetic Pixelsnap wireless charging may make it worthwhile.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 8 Pro\nThe notable Tensor G5 processor will make the most difference in the 10 Pro's performance compared to the Pixel 8 Pro, but the new flagship also features a brighter display, improved battery, and an upgraded selfie camera.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nThe Pixel 8 Pro's rear camera set is the same as the new 10 Pro, but the front-facing camera is a big upgrade, going from 10.5MP to a 42MP sensor. The display on the new flagship supports a higher peak brightness, going from the 8 Pro's 2,400 nits to 3,300 nits.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro has 16GB of RAM, an increase from the 12GB in the 8 Pro, to boost its day-to-day performance a bit more.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 7 Pro\nThe older the Pixel model you have, the bigger the upgrade the Pixel 10 Pro represents. Compared to the Pixel 7 Pro, the 10 Pro features a brighter, more resistant display, a better camera array, support for Wi-Fi 7, and faster, more capable performance.\nAlso: PixelSnap is the MagSafe for Android phones we've been waiting for - here's our first look\nThe Tensor G5 is undoubtedly a major upgrade from the Pixel 7 Pro's Tensor G2, giving the 10 Pro a noticeable difference in everyday use. This, along with bringing the RAM from 12GB to 16GB, should deliver snappier performance and the ability to run AI tasks with more ease.\nWhile the Pixel 10 Pro doesn't feature a complete overhaul of the full camera array that you've come to love in the Pixel 7 Pro, it does have some huge improvements. The Pixel 10 Pro's rear triple camera system adds a 48MP telephoto lens to what used to be a dual-camera system in the 7 Pro. The new flagship's ultrawide camera has a 48MP sensor that outshines the 7 Pro's 12MP sensor, and the front-facing camera goes from 10.8MP to 42MP.\nPixel 10 Pro versus Pixel 6 Pro\nComing from the Pixel 6 Pro to a Pixel 10 Pro is a no-brainer and will deliver the biggest upgrade for users. The camera array alone is fully updated, with more powerful sensors that have higher sensitivity -- not to mention the set of more recent Pixel-exclusive photography software features to upgrade your experience from capturing to editing.\nAlso: I compared the new $130 Pixel Buds to Apple, Sony and Bose - here's how Google wins\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro's new Tensor G5 processor is the best Pixel chipset available and a massive upgrade from the Pixel 6 Pro's original Tensor chip. If you're a Pixel 6 Pro user, this means you'll see a cleaner, snappier performance with the new smartphone.\nThe 6 Pro has an 800-nit peak brightness, which is only a fraction of the Pixel 10 Pro's 3,300 nits of peak brightness. As far as protection, the new 10 Pro has the Gorilla Glass Victus 2, a newer finish than the 6 Pro's Gorilla Glass Victus."

With gear like MagSafe batteries and MagSafe wallets that refine the mobile experience, it's easy to upgrade your phone's functionality without breaking the bank.\nThe market is flooded with smartphone accessories, and it's hard to know what is worth your cash. We simplified the process by testing numerous options ranging in product type, style, and price, so you can find the most useful MagSafe accessories. Some of the best MagSafe accessories right now are wallets, chargers, and grips.\nWhat are the best MagSafe accessories right now?\nWe rounded up some of the best, and our favorite, MagSafe accessories right now. Some of our picks are Anker's 3-1 MagGo Wireless Qi2 Charger and Casely's Grippy Mount. Read on for more top MagSafe accessories including battery packs, phone stands, car mounts, wallets, and SSDs.\nAlso: Every iPhone owner should use MagSafe -- I can't live without these 7 favorite accessories\nThe best MagSafe accessories of 2025\nIf you're a content creator or you just like to take photos and videos during solo outings, this MagSafe mount is a handy gadget to have in your MagSafe accessory repertoire. You can easily stick your phone to any clean, flat, and glossy surface and instantly create a mount for your iPhone. When I tested the Casely Grippy Mount, I was surprised by how strong the magnetic hold was, even when I stuck it to a cheap, over-the-door mirror. It's a nifty option for mounting your phone for streaming or for taking it out on solo endeavors to help shoot content hands-free.\nCustomers on Casely's website said that they liked the Grippy Mount's strong magnetic grip and hold, plus the ability to use their phone hands-free for photo, video, or entertainment purposes.\nCasely Grippy Mount features: Available in several colors | Compatible with iPhone 12 and newer, but requires MagSafe case | Fastens phone to any clean, flat, glossy surface like mirrors and windows | Allows for easy hands-free photo and video shooting, plus browsing\nAnker's MagGo 3-1 Wireless Charging Station for iPhone is still a wireless charging dream almost seven months after my initial purchase. It's also ZDNET's pick for best wireless charger. This device features 15W charging, offers a stand component for my iPhone, charges all of my Apple devices at once, and folds up for easy transport and storage. It also comes with a wall adapter, which isn't always a guarantee.\nAlso: I found a Qi2 charging station that can do it all (and Apple users will love it)\nI first purchased this Anker charger after ZDNET's Sabrina Ortiz tested it last year. I was looking for a safe and functional 3-in-1 charger that would cut down the number of cords I needed to pack while traveling. This is it. Unveiled at CES 2023, this 3-in-1 is truly worth your money if you own an Apple Watch and a pair of AirPods too and want a great charger for at home and on the go. Ortiz said that the charging speed on this charger is comparable to individual cords with respective wall adapters, even when charging simultaneously. \"Whether I was charging one device or three, I noticed that the devices were charging at a comparable speed to when I normally had them plugged into their respective wall chargers,\" she wrote in her review.\nI can concur based on my personal use. This stand charges up all of my devices quickly, and I love how easy it is to pack up to take on a trip. Even though this Anker charger is on the pricier side, costing $110, it's worth it thanks to its function and duality. It also frequently goes on sale. Compared to other options on the market, I think this 3-in-1 pick offers immense value because it can be used at home or on the go with ease, especially if you can grab it on sale.\nVerified Amazon customers give this Anker charger a 4.6 out of 5 stars and said they liked the compactness and convenience of this design as well as the easy-to-use setup, foldability, and magnetic strength. However, some customers said the simultaneous charging wasn't consistent.\nAuthor's Note: The Anker MagGo 3-1 charger in white is on sale for $82 (save $28) at Amazon upon the latest publication.\nAnker MagGo 3-1 Wireless Charging Station features: Compatibility: iPhone (any with MagSafe), Wireless Earbuds, Apple Watch | Color: White or Black | Foldable | Easy for travel | Comes with wall adapter\nThis Torras MiniMag Battery Pack is the thinnest wireless charger I've tested. It doesn't have any kickstand or added features, but its 5,000mAh capacity is pretty comparable to other packs. If you're buying a battery pack for the first time, I recommend this one. Thanks to its slim profile, you'll be able to use it realistically in more situations than not. If you're going to spend around $50 on a battery anyway, it might as well be one that is multifunctional.\nThe MiniMag pack is available typically under $50, and is only 0.3 inches thick, which makes it ultra slim and easily portable. It's a lot less bulky than other options, like the Belkin BoostCharge QI2, but it provides a similar charging experience. It provides 18W USB-C charging or 7.5W wireless charging as well.\nAlso: This ultra-thin battery pack I tested is a must-have travel gadget (and it works with MagSafe)\nDespite some possible improvement areas, like the pack being a bit slippery to hold and lacks grip, it's still a good buy. This probably isn't the best battery if you're looking for added features like kickstands or grips or larger capacity options. However, Torras does make a\nTorras users on Amazon said that they liked the quick charging speed and lightweight profile. and slim design of the Torras MiniMag battery pack. However, some said the battery gets too hot.\nTorras MiniMag Wireless charger features: Slim profile and design | Two color options | Competitive charging | 5,000mAh battery capacity | Lightweight\nIf you shoot video from your point of view (POV) frequently, consider a MagSafe accessory that will amp up your functionality. This MagSafe neck mount from Telesin does just that. ZDNET's senior reviews editor Kerry Wan tried one out while covering the iPhone 16 launch and immediately purchased one.\n\"I recently got this POV MagSafe mount, and it's perfect for hands-free video shooting. Saw dozens of content creators at Apple Park using it a few weeks ago,\" he said.\nVerified Amazon customers said that they liked the easy and simple setup of the Telesin neck mount and said that they enjoyed using it to shoot video from their POV, or to just keep using their phone hands-free. One customer said she even enjoys using this neck mount to use her phone while walking her dogs.\nTelesin MagSafe Neck Mount features: Portrait and Landscape compatible | multi-functional shooting modes like landscape, portrait, overhead, and low angle, which allows you to play with a wide range of POV scenarios | Extended pole for viewing while shooting | Enhanced Dual-Ear and Strap for added stability | Dual-sided phone grip\nAfter getting my hands on the ESR Aura MagSafe wallet and stand, I was immediately obsessed. This wallet quickly shot to the top of my rotation and rightfully earned its spot as my favorite MagSafe wallet to date.\nWhile this wallet is very similar to others, the value it offers is amazing. You get a quality vegan leather wallet, strong magnetic hold, five card slots including a dedicated ID pocket, notches for easy card access, and five universal colors to pick from -- all for under $30 right now.\nAlso: I've tested dozens of MagSafe accessories, but this new wallet stand is my ideal iPhone companion\nWhen I tested this wallet, I was most impressed with how functional the dedicated ID slot is and how purposeful every element is. Each feature, like the notches that allow for easy card access, was thoughtfully designed and implemented and truly upgraded the accessory experience. Plus, ESR offers some of the most fun colors I have seen in a long time including pastel pink, purple and some universal neutrals.\nESR customers said they liked that the Aura wallet came in vibrant colors, as well as the strong magnet, dedicated ID slot, and ample storage it provides. Some customers said that it offers great value for the price, and it has a 5-star rating on ESR's website.\nESR Aura MagSafe wallet features: Multi-functional | Dimensions: 4.1 x 2.6 x 0.5 inches | Card capacity: Five cards (includes ID window)\nIf you don't need a larger capacity to store your favorite cards, cash, or other incidentals, a card holder is probably a better bet. While Moft markets their Snap-on Phone Stand and Wallet as a wallet, it's definitely more of a card holder. Based upon my own testing, I've only ever been able to fit two cards. Most of the time prefer to just use it for one important card, like my NJ Transit SmartLink card.\nThe $30 holder's design is sleek, minimalist, and it's available in a wide range of color options. While there's cheaper wallet options out there, this is fairly priced considering the dual function. You get the stand and card holder combo, plus the quality material and construction. Most other wallet options are often upwards of $35, so Moft has competitively priced a great MagSafe accessory.\nI have used this card holder countless times, and it is my favorite option when I am traveling with only one card. I find it easy to remove and insert cards from this wallet, but sometimes it can be tricky to quickly pull out two cards. This isn't a big deal unless you're rushing to make the train in the morning like me. Regardless, I have gifted this three times and think it's a great option to add to your MagSafe collection.\nMoft Snap on Phone Stand and Wallet features: Thin profile and design | Works in Floating, Portait, and Landscape modes | Compatible with other Moft accessories, like the MagSafe battery pack | Compatible with iPhone 12+ and MagSafe compatible phone cases\nThis product makes the biggest impact if you want to upgrade your at-home desk from drab to fab. The Journey Alti Ultra was my first time using a wireless charging desk mat. My world has seriously changed since testing this over the last several months. This mat is nearly the perfect size for my smaller standing desk with just a bit of overhang. It also upgrades the plain, plastic-like surface to a luxurious and cushioned space.\nThis mat provides the perfect base for my wireless mouse and keyboard. It doesn't slide or move around, which is key while using a walking pad and standing desk. It also features certified 15W MagSafe charging for my iPhone and AirPods Pro (second-generation). The charging pad is detachable from the desk mat as well, so I can use it separately. The double-layered, reversible mat with vegan leather creates a nifty spot to slip sticky notes, papers, or other incidentals. This mat upgraded my cheap standing desk into a functional workspace, keeping all my essentials easily handy, organized, and charged in one place.\nJourney customers gave the Alti wireless desk mat five stars on the Journey website. Customers said they liked the size, detachability, and sleek, luxurious look and feel of the Alti wireless mat.

Make sure that your iPhone is compatible with the accessory you are looking to purchase and that you keep an eye out for other requirements, often hidden in the fine print, like needing a MagSafe phone case. If you're not an iPhone user, be sure to find options to make your device MagSafe compatible, and again, watch for compatibility when checking out. Always read full product descriptions before you add to your cart, trust me.\n- Price: Probably the most obvious thing to keep in mind is the cost. MagSafe accessories can be really handy and helpful, but only if they're within your budget or worth the long-term investment. Otherwise, they may be an unnecessary expense or something that winds up sitting in a drawer for several years before being tossed out. Try to keep a reasonable budget for yourself when shopping, and remember that the best products aren't always the most expensive items on the market, and it's always a good idea to check out sale events.\n- Use case: This ties into the bullet above, but keeping your use case in mind while shopping for MagSafe gear is critical to avoid buying junk that you throw out or give away down the line. For something to be worth the money you spend on it, it has to bring added value and fix a current problem you're experiencing with your phone. If you only need a card holder to store your transit card, you don't necessarily need to splash out on a pricier wallet option that holds more cards and cash. Try to stay reasonable with yourself to avoid spending unnecessary cash and contributing to more tech waste.\nHow did we choose these MagSafe accessories?\nZDNET only recommends products we ourselves have used or researched extensively so we can speak to each product's value, function, and overall user experience. While rounding up this list of MagSafe accessories, of which, we've tested every product included, here's a few things we kept in mind to guide our selections accordingly.\n- Functionality: From laptop stands to car mounts, there's a diversity of MagSafe use cases on this list. We considered user experience and overall functionality in each product we spotlighted. Keep in mind that we've gone hands-on with many other MagSafe accessories like wallets, chargers, and battery packs, and you can check out our full, in-depth best of lists if you're looking for a few more options.\n- Price: Accessorizing your mobile device is a lot like customizing a purse or a bedroom. You have essential items like cases and chargers, as well as nonessential add-ons like grips, stands, mounts, and more. The beauty of accessorizing is you can take it as little or as far as you'd like and spend as little or as much as you're comfortable with. While most accessories remain under the $100 mark, there are several items like MagSafe charging stations that can easily push over that limit. We made sure to consider numerous types of accessories across varying price points and their overall value compared to what you'll pay. We think every item on this list is worth the money if it's the type of product you're looking for, but ultimately, the total cost spent on accessorizing with MagSafe is up to you.\n- Best List picks: The accessory options included in this list are certainly not the only options available on the market and are definitely not the only MagSafe accessories that we've tried. Since ZDNET has already extensively tested many MagSafe accessories across several categories, including MagSafe wallets, battery packs, wireless chargers, and more, we considered the top-ranking picks selected for those lists to ensure congruency on our site and to maintain the authority in our picks.\nFAQs on MagSafe accessories\nWhat is MagSafe?\nMagSafe was originally developed as a safety feature for MacBook charging cords, but it's now built into iPhone 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 models for use with a range of accessories.\nThe system uses a series of magnets around the iPhone's internal charging coil that sense other compatible devices and hold them securely. The magnets are specifically designed for the MagSafe system to protect your iPhone from damage.\nWhich iPhone models have MagSafe?\nThe majority of recent iPhone models on the market including the iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16 feature MagSafe charging. Some charging cases for Apple's AirPods, such as the latest AirPods Pro, also have MagSafe built in. The newest iPhone 16e is not MagSafe compatible.\nAlso: Every iPhone 16 model compared: Which new iPhone should you buy?\nIs MagSafe the same as Qi?\nThe two systems work on the same wireless charging principles, but the key difference is that Qi chargers don't use magnets for alignment. Qi chargers need a near-perfect alignment for optimal speeds. The MagSafe system eliminates the hassle of positioning and repositioning your devices on the charger by using magnets to properly align the charging puck and iPhone's internal charging coils, giving you consistent, fast charging every time.\nIs MagSafe charging better than cable charging?\nIt's a personal preference. Both cable charging and wireless charging boost your phone effectively. But with a cable, you must ensure you're near an outlet or alternative power source when recharging your phone.\nWith MagSafe, you can experience wire-free charging at home and even purchase a battery pack for power on the go. So, if you're a mobile a lot, we recommend a MagSafe battery pack to keep your iPhone charged while you travel. For certain situations or environments, a cable may be preferred.\nWhy should I bother with MagSafe accessories?\nMagSafe capabilities can enhance your user experience and your iPhone's functionality. Besides creating simpler, more efficient wireless charging, MagSafe technology opens the door for various accessories such as wallets, car vent clips and mounts, fitness mounts, power banks, grips and key ring accessories, and more to widen the iPhone experience and make your life as efficient as possible.\nAre there alternative MagSafe accessories to consider?\nThe market is flooded with MagSafe accessory options. Check out a few other picks we'd recommend below.\nBest MagSafe expandable wallet accessory\nOhsnap Snap Grip Wallet\nThe Ohsnap Snap Grip Wallet is a MagSafe expandable wallet. It's super sleek, comes in several colors, and includes a built-in grip and stand. I love it for its premium look and lightweight feel, but keep in mind you will have to remove this off the back of your device in order to access your cards.\nAlso: I've tested dozens of MagSafe wallets, but this is the most premium one yet\nBest travel 3-in-1 MagSafe charger\nAnker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Foldable Charger\nIf you're looking for the ultimate travel charger, I love this 3-in-1 option from Anker. It's great for travel and at-home use, lightweight, and folds up easily. Plus, it comes in four colors.\nAlso: My new favorite travel accessory is a 3-in-1 MagSafe charger that's smaller than a cookie\nBest MagSafe car mount and charger\nESR Qi2 15W MagSafe Wireless Car Charger and Mount\nIf you're looking for a home for your phone in the car, ESR's MagSafe mount keeps your cell in one spot, makes a great road trip companion, and offers Qi2 15W charging, so you'll never be without a battery.\nAlso: Finally, an iPhone car mount with Qi2 charging and won't break the bank"

Considering it's the iPhone 16 that we're talking about, perhaps I shouldn't be as surprised by the polish and familiarity.\nAlso: Tech winners and losers of 2024: The year in true innovation and total product flops\nOnce you factor in all the new features, including the Action button, Camera Control, and incoming Apple Intelligence, the standard iPhones feel more capable than ever -- so much so that I'm not feeling much Pro model FOMO this time around. It helps that they look fantastic, with bold and tasteful colors that most people will be drawn to as soon as they walk inside an Apple store. I saw it with my own eyes on launch day.\nWith this year's standard iPhones, Apple is taking what I'd like to call the \"Sibling\" strategy. You know how the older sibling tends to get all the latest and greatest things first -- shirts, toys, and shoes? After a year, or when the excitement for something wears off, it's passed down to the younger sibling, so what's old is new again. That's exactly what Apple has done with last year's iPhone 15 Pro model and this year's iPhone 16, and I don't mind that at all.\nAlso: iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 16: Should you upgrade to Apple's latest model?\nThe new Action button, for example, replaces the physical mute-switch toggle and can be mapped to a unique function, from turning on the flashlight to starting a voice memo to firing up the camera. Of course, you can also set the Action button to switch between alert and silent.\nConsidering this is the iPhone's have-it-your-way era, you should really try to embrace the customization freedom here. My Action button is currently set to \"turn on AirDrop for 10 minutes\" as I'm camera-testing the phone and frequently uploading images and videos to my MacBook. That prompt will likely change by the end of the week, possibly to quick-launch the ESPN app, so that I can catch up on NFL scores and be let down by the Giants again. That's all part of the beauty of the Action button... and Giants football.\nThere's also a new Camera Control located on the bottom-right side of the phones, which looks and functions like the one on the Pro versions. At the most basic level, pressing the Camera Control snaps a photo or starts a video recording. For some Apple magic, a lighter, more gentle press of the same key (Apple tells me not to call it a button) brings up a slider for your most recent camera setting, whether that's zoom range, exposure, or f-stop.\nAlso: We tested the iPhone 16 Pro camera system, and it's highly underrated - with one tragic flaw\nA double light press on Camera Control brings up a carousel of shooting modes and settings, each of which you can access with another light press. Lastly, swiping on the touch-capacitive surface will dial between the settings.\nThat's to say, Camera Control has a learning curve, so much so that I wouldn't have been mad if Apple made the feature exclusive to the Pro models. Because it's not, it will be many users' first experience with adjusting camera settings at such a finite level, and that's very exciting.\nGoing into my testing, my biggest concern was whether the placement (or ergonomics) of the Camera Control would spoil what is otherwise a genius feature. Since the key is situated closer to the middle of the side edge (more so if you're on the smaller iPhone 16), you're now capturing photos by pressing down with your index finger instead of your thumb. Retraining your muscle memory is required here; I often found myself habitually tapping the screen to focus and capture instead.\nThe positioning of Camera Control also means that whenever I capture photos in a 16:9 aspect ratio (like the ones for this review), which takes up more viewfinder space, my shutter hand often covers part of the screen. That may be a concern when I'm taking a family photo or of a landscape that spans from one end of the viewfinder to the other, and I want the proper framing.\nWhile it works both ways, Camera Control encourages you to position the iPhone in landscape orientation, playing to the iPhone 16's newest ability to capture immersive spatial photos and videos for VR. It's another feature that's trickled down from last year's Pro model, but nothing I'd stress using.\nMuch like how you'll need an elusive 8K TV to watch 8K videos, you'll need a compatible VR headset to consume spatial content. I've watched several spatial videos on both the Apple Vision Pro and the Meta Quest 3, and while they're much more immersive than any other digital content out there, the ability to capture them should be seen as a bonus and not a requisite as you consider the iPhone 16.\nAlso: Every iPhone 16 model features a new camera button. Here's what it can do\nYou're more likely to take advantage of the new 12MP ultrawide camera. With an f/2.2 aperture (versus last year's f/2.4), the iPhone 16 can pull in more light (read: capture more details both during the day and night) and take macro shots, much like how the iPhone 15 Pro does with its ultrawide lens.\nThe iPhone 16 brings together the utility of the ultrawide with the new 48MP Fusion camera (which combines the main with a 2x digital zoom capability) and Photographic Styles that can now be modified before and after the shot (which is a game-changer if you've never been a fan of the balanced, low-contrast look of the iPhone's default color profile). The result is one of the most versatile iPhone camera systems ever.\nWhether it was reproducing the vibrant colors of my dinner in a dimly lit restaurant, extracting details from small succulents, or capturing the controlled chaos of my morning commute, I rarely felt like the iPhone 16 was unable to get the shot.\nAlso: Why my new iPhone 16 cost me way more than its retail price\nI say rarely because there was one evening when I wanted to take a photo of the moon. It appeared closer to the Earth than ever, was glowing in a warm orangish hue, and felt like the perfect photo-op with my family celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival back in September.\nUnfortunately, the iPhone 16's zoom capability, capped at 2x like last year, was barely able to capture the essence of the moment. There was a noticeable amount of noise as I hesitantly dialed up the digital zoom, and, for once, I missed the 5x optical camera on the Pro models.\nWhile I hoped to see at least a 90Hz refresh rate on the new iPhones, assuming that ProMotion (120Hz) was restricted to Pro devices only, Apple continues to ship the standard models with 60Hz panels. This isn't a deal-breaker by any means, and frankly, users coming from older non-Pro iPhone models won't know what they're missing. Rendering fewer frames also helps the iPhone 16's battery life, which, so far, has been sufficient to last me about a day and a half per charge.\nStill, it's 2024, when even a $150 Android phone comes with smoother display tech. A 90Hz panel, let alone a 120Hz panel, would've made me instantly upgrade from an iPhone 14 or iPhone 15.\nAlso: How iOS 18 changes the way you charge your iPhone\nTo Apple's credit, the company did bump up the wireless charging speed (up to 25W via MagSafe) on iPhone 16 models, though wired charging rates remain at 20W. From my testing, the iPhone 16 Plus charged from 0% to 100% in roughly one hour and 47 minutes, which is noticeably slower than most flagship phones ($700+) on the market. But, again, if you're coming from an older non-Pro iPhone, the speeds won't impress or disappoint you.\nThe state of Apple Intelligence (for now)\nThere's one thing I haven't mentioned yet in this review, and that's Apple Intelligence, the suite of artificial intelligence tools scattered across iOS 18. That's because the bulk of the AI experience was released late in October, and many consumers are just starting to pick up on its features. Some of them, like Image Playground and Genmoji came out last month, while Siri integration across more apps is expected to arrive next year.\nI've been testing the beta, and some AI features are certainly more useful and practical than others. For example, I'm a fan of the new Siri, which leverages ChatGPT to better understand natural language, taking into account stutters, pause fillers, and corrections you make in your prompts. I can ask Siri to show me the AFC standings and follow up with a question specifically about the Giants, and it'll understand that I'm referencing the football team and not the baseball team.\nAlso: iOS 18 with Apple Intelligence is here. Try these 5 AI features first\nOther Apple Intelligence features, like notification summaries, have been hit-or-miss for me. They often oversimplify or misinterpret things, such as when a Threads user's comment was summarized as \"Red iPhone and Google phone is lavender.\" Again, I'm on the beta, so most of this should hopefully be fixed via training and software updates. There's room for recovery.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThat's to say, you shouldn't buy the iPhone 16 for its AI capabilities -- not yet, at least. Until the software is more polished, my advice is that unless your carrier offers a generous trade-in deal for your iPhone 14 or iPhone 15, you should wait a few more months and see how Apple progresses with its AI developments and if there are any features you would use on a regular basis.\nUntil then, I'll continue to evaluate the iPhone 16 for what it is, and you should consider it for what it offers today. That means buying it for the performant A18 chipset, the more flexible camera system, and the exceptional battery life. If you value one-handed usability and comfort, go with the smaller iPhone 16. If you value longer battery life and a more immersive viewing experience and are willing to pay $100 more, go with the iPhone 16 Plus. Everything else about the two models, from the camera systems to the processors to the charging speeds, are identical.\nHow we test phones\nZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major phone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and special features. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:\n- Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.\n- Performance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, all background tasks closed, and as stable a mobile connection as possible.\n- Camera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.\n- Battery life and charging: We evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).\n- Special features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users.\n- Pricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.\nFor a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.\nThis article was originally published on September 24, 2024, and was updated on December 6, 2024."

That was challenging since I've had one since the beginning. But, as Google made its plans clear that the Pixel 9 line of phones would be all about AI, I decided I'd had enough.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2024\nThere were two main reasons I'd decided it was time to jump ship: Too much AI is a bad thing, and bland designs. In that decision, I'd set my sights on the Nothing Phone 3. Since then, however, it became clear that AI would be intertwined no matter which phone I purchased.\nSad trombone sound.\nI get it. I really do. Every tech company believes AI is good for us (whether we agree or not). AI is here to stay, and the only way to avoid it might be to purchase one of the many low-end phones that will be lucky to have Gemini on board as an assistant.\nAlso: Pixel 9 Pro XL vs. Galaxy S24 Ultra: I tested both and here are the key differences\nSo, why did I purchase a Pixel 9 Pro? Outside of throwing my hands up in the air about AI, there were a few reasons. So let me explain.\n1. The new design\nI've been waiting for Google to finally wake up and realize its designs were blah. The only Pixel device with a smattering of aesthetic taste was the Pixel 4, and that phone was wrecked by the worst battery in the history of Pixel devices.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 9 model, and this is the best one for most people\nGoogle wanted us to believe the Pixel designs were sleek and elegant, but they were uninspired and couldn't stand up to the competition. Seriously, look what Carl Pei and Nothing were doing with design. You can't beat that.\nBut then, the Pixel 9 was leaked (and finally announced), and I have to say Google finally did it. That hideous edge-to-edge camera hump? Gone. In its place is a more standard camera pill that brings the Pixel phones more in line with modern aesthetics. On top of that, we're finally getting some fun colorways that rival what Google offered with the Pixel 4. Phones should have a bit of personality, and the Pixel 9 achieves that.\n2. The camera\nThe one thing that had me hesitant to switch phones was the blasted Pixel camera. To say it's good is a massive understatement. I've tried so many different phones and have yet to find one with a better camera.\nAlso: Google Pixel 9 Pro vs Pixel 8 Pro: The key differences\nIt's not that I take a ton of photos with my phone but, when I do, my Pixel 8 Pro has not once let me down. The quality of the Pixel cameras is so much better than the competition that it's almost unfair, so the idea of using a lesser camera had me questioning my decision from the start.\n3. Android, pure and simple\nOther than the camera, the one thing I've enjoyed the most about the Pixel phones is the version of Android shipped with the devices. There's no OEM overlay or bloatware to deal with and the Pixel Launcher is hard to beat. Most of the major Android phone manufacturers offer their own takes on Android and I've yet to see what that improves on the OG. And with all the bloatware shipped with other devices, it can get very frustrating trying to remove those redundant (and lesser-quality apps).\n4. The onboarding\nIf you've ever purchased a Pixel phone to replace a previous Pixel phone, you know how seamless and effortless the onboarding process is. Connect both phones via a USB C cable and let Android do its thing. All the apps are installed for you, your accounts are transferred, and even some configurations are migrated. It seriously doesn't get any easier than that, and the thought of using a sub-par onboarding process makes me cringe.\n5. The trade-in\nGoogle offered me a $700 trade-in value for my Pixel 8 Pro, which brought the price of the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro, including a case, to just under $600. Sure, I could have purchased a mid-level phone at that price, but getting a flagship phone for $600 is a bargain that I couldn't pass up.\nAlso: I went hands-on with Google's $1,800 Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and I'm ready to leave Samsung\nGoogle has always been fairly generous with trade-in values, so if you're considering upgrading, I recommend checking your trade-in value there first.\nI've been hanging with the Pixel devices for a long time, and they have rarely let me down. Yes, there have been some call quality, battery, and Bluetooth issues over the years, but that's almost to be expected in this era of release, release, release. Would I have liked to have found another phone that was every bit the equal to the Pixel? Of course. Unfortunately, from my perspective, that phone doesn't exist.\nErgo, I'm sticking with the Pixel.\nFor now."

Google's launch of its Pixel 10 Series is no different, with some new features Google hopes might draw in new users from other devices.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nAt its Made by Google event, Google unveiled the new Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and Pixel 10, as well as the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a. Beyond fun new phone colors, better camera systems, and other hardware upgrades, AI is at the core, powered by the new Google Tensor G5 processor.\nThe chipset, co-designed with Google DeepMind, can run Gemini Nano on the device, the engine powering all these new AI experiences. Here's a full round-up of the new AI features and my personal hands-on experiences with each.\n1. Magic Cue\nWhile AI tools like chatbots can be helpful, they require you to context-switch to other tabs, ask your question, go back to whichever window you were originally working out of, and paste it in. In order to upgrade that experience and level up the assistance, AI needs to predict your needs -- which is exactly what Magic Cue aims to do.\nAlso: I tried the standard Google Pixel 10 and didn't miss the Pro models one bit\nThe Magic Cue feature suggests relevant information and actions based on what you're doing. For example, in the demo featured in the image above, the user was calling an airline, so Magic Cue automatically surfaced the flight details to prevent scrambling to find them while on the call.\nIn another demo, the user got a text asking where the reservation was. Instead of the demoer having to find the details, Magic Cue surfaced the reservation information based on what was in the user's inbox. Then, all the user had to do was tap and send it. Since the feature leverages the Google Tensor G5 chip, information is processed locally on the device.\n2. Daily Hub\nSticking with the trend of making information as accessible as possible, the new Daily Hub feature found in your Discover feed puts all of the information you need in one place. It also includes an integration with Magic Cue, which gathers insights from your apps.\nAs seen in the image, it can remind you of actions from your Google Keep and Gmail, including dinner plans, reservations, and flight details. In practice, it is very similar to Samsung's At a Glance feature, just native to the Google experience powering Pixel.\n3. Voice Translate\nOne use case where generative AI really excels is language translation. Because LLMs have a deep grasp of language and how people speak -- including conversational and non-linear speech -- speech translation has gotten a lot more accurate. As a result, many smartphone manufacturers, like Apple, are incorporating AI translation in their own products, and Google unveiled its own.\nWith Voice Translation, you can hear a translation in real time while on a phone call. The most noteworthy part is that it copies the sound of the speaker's voice, making the new audio sound as free-flowing and natural as possible. There is also a really helpful transcript you can follow to help keep track of the dialogue even further.\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but the Google Pixel 10 has me reconsidering my loyalty\nWhen I demoed the feature, I was pleasantly surprised at how quick it was, and most importantly, at how well it copied my voice to make me sound like I was actually speaking German. At rollout, Voice Translate works when translating to or from English with Spanish, German, Japanese, French, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, and Indonesian.\n4. Camera Coach\nA good chunk of the new AI features are focused on elevating your photo-taking and editing experience. The new Camera Coach feature aims to take the guesswork out of taking a photo, using Gemini's multimodal capabilities to help you snap the perfect shot by suggesting angles, lighting, and camera modes.\nBeyond step-by-step instructions, Gemini will even generate a sample image of what you should aim for in the final product. For example, in a demo, the user was trying to take a photo of a plant leaf but had the angle off-center. Gemini generated the image of the leaf positioned correctly, so then all the demoer had to do was match the visual by adjusting his position.\nAlso: Google just copied the worst feature of modern iPhones (but not all hope is lost)\nOne of the features I was most impressed by was Camera Coach's ability to recognize what was being shown in the display, down to the specific location. For example, in the image above, the Camera Coach asked the demoer what they wanted to be shown in the photo by identifying that it was a waterfront view, and that it was Chelsea Piers in New York, alongside the Hudson River.\n5. Edit with Ask Photos\nProducing a good photo is equal parts capturing the right shot and post-production editing to optimize it. However, photo editing can often be tricky (especially if you're inexperienced), as there are so many little tools often used in combination. This new feature allows you to describe the change you want using natural language and have the AI make the changes instantaneously.\nAlso: I tried Pixel Watch 4 - and these are my 7 favorite upgrades in Google's new watch\nFor example, the image at the top of the article was very nicely framed, but it had a distracting glare. Instead of having to find the right tools, you can just say that you'd like to remove the glare, and in a couple of seconds, it's done. Other, more general applications include asking it to \"make it better\" resulted in actions like straightening it out and improving the lighting.\n6. Improved the Add Me feature and Auto Best Take\nWhile the Add Me and Auto Best Take features are not new, Google upgraded them to make them even more helpful. The Add Me feature, which lets people add the photographer to the photo, now works with photos with an even bigger group of people.\nMeanwhile, Auto Best Take automatically finds the best picture in which everyone looks great, where previously you would have had to manually select which ones you wanted to combine.\nBonus: Google AI Pro plan one-year subscription\nGoogle's AI Pro Plan costs $20 per month and packages all of Google's best AI offerings. These include the best models in Gemini and standalone tools, including expanded access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, NotebookLM, Deep Research, Veo 3, and Jules."

No, not Apple's product launch -- that's next month. I'm talking about Made by Google 2025. The tech giant held its annual event on Wednesday, where it showed off its upcoming releases; namely the Pixel 10 series, Pixel Watch 4, and the Pixel Buds 2a.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nWe managed to get a sneak peek at the devices ahead of the big day, and we're here to share everything we know. Admittedly, none of the hardware announcements are super surprising. We've had a pretty good idea that the aforementioned devices were going to be headliners, especially since Google unveiled the Pixel 10 series early in July.\nIt isn't all hardware reveals, however, as the event packs a few notable surprises -- including new smartphone features like Magic Cue and Pixelsnap. Google provided a more entertaining look during its presentation, but here's a quick breakdown of all the products and software updates being shown off at Made by Google.\n1. Google Pixel 10 series: Pro, XL, and Fold\nGoogle's Pixel 10 series is the star of the show. The line consists of four models: the base Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Unlike the previous generation, this batch isn't an overhaul of the Pixel line. It primarily builds on what the Pixel 9 line brought to the table.\nPixel 10: Starting with the base model, the Pixel 10 sports a 6.3-inch Actua display, 12GB of RAM, and a new 5x telephoto camera alongside the 50MP wide and 48MP ultrawide lenses. This new option delivers 10x optical image quality and Super Res Zoom up to 20x, letting you capture high-quality close-up shots from further away. Pricing starts at $799, and the model will be available in Obsidian (black), Indigo (blue), Frost (white), and Lemongrass (green).\nPixel 10 Pro: The Pro model is similar in size, sporting a 6.3-inch Super Actua display that outputs at a new peak brightness of 3,300 nits. Notable upgrades include 16GB of RAM, a purported 30-hour battery life, and a better 5x telephoto lens, allowing the Pixel 10 Pro to support 100x Pro Res Zoom for great-looking closeups. Prices start at $999, and it'll be available in Obsidian (black), Moonstone (gray), Porcelain (white), and Jade (green).\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but Google just sold me on the Pixel 10 with these features\nPixel 10 Pro XL: The Pixel 10 Pro XL has many of the same features and specifications as the Pixel 10 Pro, with one major difference: It has a 6.8-inch Super Actua display. Prices start at $1,199, and it'll be available in the same colors as the 10 Pro.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is larger than the previous generation, boasting a 6.4-inch Actua outer display and an 8-inch Super Actua inner display. Google made interesting design changes, namely what it describes as a \"new gearless, high-strength hinge\" that allows the 10 Pro Fold to survive over 10 years of constant opening and closing.\nPerhaps more importantly, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first foldable phone to feature an IP68 rating, providing complete protection against dust and allowing it to survive brief submersion underwater. Its closest competitor, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, only supports an IP48 rating. Pricing for the Fold starts at $1,799, and it'll be available in two colors: Moonstone and Jade.\nAll four models run on Google's new Tensor G5 chipset, which the company says is 60% more powerful than the previous generation Tensor G4. Each smartphone boasts 30-hour battery life, key support from Gemini AI, and receives seven years of software and security updates. Preorders for the Pixel 10 series have begun, August 20, with open sales availability starting next week on August 28.\nYou will have to wait a while to order the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, as it won't be available until October 9.\n2. Magic Cue, Pixelsnap, and more AI tools\nGoogle is once again utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to elevate the user experience. This time, the company is focused on improving AI assistance on its smartphones to make certain features easier to use. Additionally, Google is making an interesting design change that could revamp the way people interact with their Pixel phones.\nAlso: How to clear your Android phone cache (and give it a serious speed boost)\nMagic Cue: Magic Cue is another personal assistant AI, but one that's more proactive. Instead of waiting for your input, the feature anticipates your needs and suggests actions or provides information \"based on the context of your phone.\" For example, let's say you're calling your airline about an upcoming flight. Magic Cue will instantly bring up your flight details during the call.\nCamera updates: All Pixel 10 models will receive two new camera features. First is Camera Coach, which will provide suggestions on how to set up shots or recommend certain camera modes to use. Auto Best Take allows the phone to combine similar photographs into one perfect image. Then there's the improved Add Me. While functioning much like before, the feature now lets you add the photographer to bigger group photos.\nPixelsnap: Pixelsnap is a new magnetic technology that will be included on all Pixel 10 phones. It allows users to snap Qi2-compatible wireless chargers, stands, and grips to the back of the device. If that sounds familiar, iPhones have supported similar technology for years.\nAlso: PixelSnap is the MagSafe for Android phones we've been waiting for - here's our first look\nTo coincide with the implementation of Pixelsnap, Google will be rolling out supporting accessories. The Pixelsnap Charger ($40) provides Qi2 wireless charging up to 25W. The Pixelsnap Charger with Stand ($70) does the same thing but sports a stable dock to support smartphones. Then there's the Pixelsnap Ring Stand ($30) for hands-free viewing. Google will also release special Pixelsnap compatible phone cases at $50 each.\n3. Google Pixel Buds 2a\nGoogle is revealing the Pixel Buds 2a, a new budget-friendly version of the Pixel Buds 2 Pro. Housed inside the familiar egg-shaped case, the company says this pair is the first A-Series earbuds to feature Active Noise Cancelation with Silent Seal 1.5 to block out outside noise. To hear the surrounding environment, users can activate Transparency Mode to allow sound to pass through.\nGoogle's Pixel Buds 2a shares multiple features with the Buds 2 Pro, including 11mm dynamic drivers, support for spatial audio, and a 5-band equalizer for adjusting the bass, treble, and other parts of the audio. The buds run on the Tensor A1 chipset and boast a 20-hour battery life with the charging case.\nAlso: I compared the new $130 Pixel Buds to Apple, Sony and Bose - here's how Google wins\nThe Pixel Buds 2a will be available on store shelves on October 9 for $130, and in two colors: Hazel (black) and Iris (light blue). Preorders open today, August 20. There is no word on when the Pixel Buds 3 Pro will roll out. However, if Google follows the same pattern with the Buds Pro and Buds 2 Pro, expect new earbuds next year.\n4. Google Pixel Watch 4\nRounding out the list is the Pixel Watch 4. Google's future wearable introduces multiple design updates and extra safety features.\nLike the Pixel Watch 3, this model sports an Actua 360 domed display made out of tough Corning Gorilla Glass. However, this generation's touchscreen is 10% larger than before and 50% brighter, boasting 3,000 nits. Its battery sees an improvement too, now lasting a purported 40 hours on a single charge for the 45mm model and 30 hours for the 41mm watch.\nAlso: I tried Pixel Watch 4 - and these are my 7 favorite upgrades in Google's new watch\nBoth sizes are gaining 25% faster charging speeds, along with a redesigned charging system that now flanks the side edge of the watch instead of the middle surface. How this plays out in the real world remains to be tested.\nThe most significant design change, however, is that the Pixel Watch 4 can actually be repaired. Google says the wearable is its \"first watch designed with serviceability in mind\" as users are able to replace the display and battery.\nMany safety features found on the Pixel Watch 4 are carryovers from the Pixel Watch 3. You have Loss of Pulse, which allows the Watch 4 to call for an ambulance if it detects that your heart has stopped beating. Fall and Crash Detection contacts emergency services if it detects that you've had a bad fall or were in a car accident.\nThere is a new feature in all this. Pixel Watch 4 LTE has an SOS satellite communication function that enables users to contact emergency services if they're ever in a location without any cellular or Wi-Fi connections.\nAlso: The best smartwatches 2025: I wore these for weeks and found the perfect one for your wrist\nThe Pixel Watch 4 will be available in two different sizes: 41mm and 45mm, with colors correlating to a certain size. The 45 Pixel Watch 4 will have three colors for its wrist bands: black, white, and gray. The 41mm Pixel Watch 4 keeps the white and black wrist bands, but also throws in Iris blue and Lemongrass green bands.\nThe 41mm Pixel Watch 4 will retail for $350, while the 45mm model will be a bit more expensive at $400. Preorders go live today, August 20. The wearable is set to hit store shelves on October 9."

Everything to know about artificial intelligence\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a concept that refers to a machine's ability to perform a task that would've previously required human intelligence. It's been around since the 1950s, and its definition has been modified over decades of research and technological advancements.\nToday, AI powers self-driving cars, laptops, chatbots like ChatGPT, and image generators. So what is it, and how does it work?\nThe phrase AI comes from the idea that if intelligence is inherent to organic life, its existence elsewhere makes it artificial. Computer scientist Alan Turing was one of the first to explore the idea that machines could use information and logic to make decisions as people do. He coined the Turing test, which compares machine ability to human ability to see if people can detect it as artificial (convincing deepfakes are an example of AI passing the Turing test).\nBasic computing systems function because programmers code them to do specific tasks. AI, on the other hand, is only possible when computers can store information, including past commands, similar to how the human brain learns by storing skills and memories. This ability makes AI systems capable of adapting and performing new skills for tasks they weren't explicitly programmed to do.\nAlso: ChatGPT vs. Microsoft Copilot vs. Gemini: Which is the best AI chatbot?\nSome experts define intelligence as the ability to adapt, solve problems, plan, improvise in new situations, and learn new things. Though these systems aren't a replacement for human intelligence or social interaction, today's AI systems demonstrate some traits found in human intelligence, including learning, problem-solving, pattern-finding, perception, and even a limited spectrum of creativity and social awareness.\nAlso: The best AI image generators to try right now\nOf course, an important component of human intelligence is something that AI hasn't been able to replicate yet: context. For example, Google AI lacks real-world logic and can't discern human subtleties like sarcasm and humor, as evidenced by the technology advising you to add glue to pizza sauce to help the cheese stick or use gasoline to make spaghetti spicy. These examples are lower stakes, but an AI system taking action without semantic understanding can have major consequences in the wrong situation.\nHow can I use AI?\nAI has a slew of possible applications, many of which are now widely available in everyday life. At the consumer level, this potential includes the newly revamped Google Search, wearables, and even vacuums. The smart speakers on your mantle with Alexa or Google voice assistant built-in are also great examples of AI.\nPopular AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and Claude can be used for conversational questions or tasks, like breaking down concepts, drafting emails or project outlines, and even writing creative stories. But because AI models cannot tell fact from fiction, these chatbots tend to hallucinate or make things up -- where applicable, always verify the statements a chatbot makes with independent research, especially if you're unsure about the quality of its citations.\nAlso: How does ChatGPT work?\nA major function of AI in consumer products is personalization, whether for targeted ads or biometric security. This is why your phone can distinguish your face from someone else's when you're unlocking it with Face ID, for example -- it's learned what yours looks like by referencing billions of other people's faces and matching specific data points.\nOn a bigger scale, marketing and content teams can use AI to streamline production, while developers write and execute code with it. AI can also exponentially increase the speed and efficiency of medical research.\nWhat is machine learning (ML)?\nMachine learning (ML) refers to the process of training a set of algorithms on large amounts of data to recognize patterns, which helps make predictions and decisions. This pattern-seeking enables systems to automate tasks they haven't been explicitly programmed to do, which is the biggest differentiator of AI from other computer science topics. This capability is what many refer to as AI, but ML is a subset of AI.\nWhen data is structured, or organized, a system can more easily detect an anomaly -- for example, when a transaction on your credit card is from a part of the world it's not used to seeing in your activity.\nAlso: What is machine learning? Everything you need to know\nExamples of ML include search engines, image and speech recognition, and fraud detection. Similar to Face ID, when users upload photos to Facebook, the social network's image recognition can analyze the images, recognize faces, and make recommendations to tag the friends it's identified. With time, practice, and more image data, the system hones this skill and becomes more accurate.\nHow does machine learning work?\nMachine learning is generally split into two main categories: supervised and unsupervised learning.\nSupervised learning\nThis common technique for teaching AI systems uses annotated data or data labeled and categorized by humans. ML systems are then fed this data to learn patterns.\nSuppose you wanted to train an ML model to recognize and differentiate images of circles and squares. In that case, you'd gather a large dataset of images of circles (like photos of planets, wheels, and other circular objects) and squares (tables, whiteboards, etc.), complete with labels for what each shape is.\nThe algorithm would then learn from this labeled collection of images to distinguish the shapes and their characteristics: in this case, circles don't have corners, and squares have four equal-length sides. The system can then see a new image and determine the shapes.\nUnsupervised learning\nBy contrast, unsupervised learning lets algorithms try to identify patterns in unlabeled data by looking for similarities that it can use to categorize the data.\nThe algorithms aren't programmed in advance to pick out specific types of data; they simply look for data with similarities that they can group -- for example, segmenting customers based on shopping behavior to target them with personalized marketing campaigns.\nAlso: Machine learning is going real-time: Here's why and how\nReinforcement learning\nIn reinforcement learning, the system is trained to maximize a reward based on input data, going through a trial-and-error process until it arrives at the best possible outcome.\nImagine training a system to play a video game. The system can receive a positive reward if it gets a higher score and a negative reward for a low score. The system learns to analyze the game and make moves, learning solely from the rewards it receives. It can eventually play by itself and learn to achieve a high score without human intervention.\nReinforcement learning is also used in research, where it can help teach autonomous robots the optimal way to behave in real-world environments. Robots learning to navigate new environments they haven't ingested data on -- like maneuvering around surprise obstacles -- is an example of more advanced ML that can be considered AI.\nWhat are the different types of AI?\nArtificial intelligence can be divided into three subcategories: narrow AI, general AI, and super AI.\nWhat is narrow AI?\nArtificial narrow intelligence (ANI) refers to intelligent systems designed or trained to carry out specific tasks or solve particular problems without being explicitly designed. This type of AI is crucial to voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.\nANI is sometimes called weak AI, as it doesn't possess general intelligence. But that doesn't mean it isn't powerful in its own right. In addition to voice assistants, image-recognition systems, technologies that respond to simple customer service requests, and tools that flag inappropriate content online are examples of ANI.\nChatGPT is also an example of ANI, as it is programmed to perform a specific task: generate text responses to prompts it's given.\nWhat is general AI?\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI), or strong AI, is still a hypothetical concept as it involves a machine understanding and autonomously performing vastly different tasks based on accumulated experience. This type of intelligence is more on the level of human intellect, as AGI systems would be able to reason and think more like people do.\nAlso: AI's true goal may no longer be intelligence\nLike a human, AGI could potentially understand any intellectual task, think abstractly, learn from its experiences, and use that knowledge to solve new problems. Essentially, we're talking about a system or machine capable of common sense, which is currently unachievable with any available AI.\nDeveloping a system with consciousness is still, presumably, a fair way in the distance, but it is the ultimate goal of AI research. OpenAI hints that its forthcoming GPT-5 will get us closer to AGI.\nWhat is super AI?\nArtificial superintelligence (ASI) would be a machine intelligence that surpasses all forms of human intelligence and outperforms humans in every function. A system like this wouldn't just rock humankind to its core -- it could also destroy it. If that sounds like something straight out of a science fiction novel, it's because it kind of is.\nAlso: Mechanics of the future: Meet the specialists assembling AI\nAn intelligent system that can learn and continuously improve itself is still a hypothetical concept. However, if applied effectively and ethically, the system could lead to extraordinary progress and achievements in medicine, technology, and more.\nWhat are some recent examples of AI?\nSome of the most impressive advancements in AI are the development and release of GPT 3.5 and, most recently, GPT-4o, in addition to lifelike AI avatars and deepfakes. But there have been many other revolutionary achievements in AI -- too many to include here.\nHere are some of the most notable.\nChatGPT (and the GPTs)\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot capable of generating and translating natural language and answering questions. Though it's arguably the most popular AI tool, thanks to its widespread accessibility, OpenAI made significant waves in artificial intelligence by creating GPTs 1, 2, and 3 before releasing ChatGPT.\nAlso: 6 ways ChatGPT can make your everyday life easier\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, and GPT-3 was the largest language model at its 2020 launch, with 175 billion parameters. Then came GPT-3.5, which powers the free tier of ChatGPT. The largest version, GPT-4, accessible through the free version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Plus, and Microsoft Copilot, has one trillion parameters.\nSelf-driving cars\nThough the safety of self-driving cars is a top concern for potential users, the technology continues to advance and improve with breakthroughs in AI. These vehicles use ML algorithms to combine data from sensors and cameras to perceive their surroundings and determine the best course of action.\nAlso: An autonomous car that wakes up and greets you could be in your future\nThe autopilot feature in Tesla's electric vehicles is probably what most people think of when considering self-driving cars. But Waymo, from Google's parent company Alphabet, also makes autonomous rides -- as a driverless taxi, for example, or to deliver Uber Eats -- in San Francisco, CA, and Phoenix, AZ.\nCruise is another robotaxi service, and auto companies like Audi, GM, and Ford are also presumably working on self-driving vehicle technology.\nRobotics\nThe achievements of Boston Dynamics stand out in the area of AI and robotics. Though we're still a long way from creating Terminator-level AI technology, watching Boston Dyanmics' hydraulic, humanoid robots use AI to navigate and respond to different terrains is impressive.\nDeepMind\nGoogle subsidiary DeepMind is an AI pioneer focusing on AGI. Though not there yet, the company made headlines in 2016 for creating AlphaGo, an AI system that beat the world's best (human) professional Go player.\nSince then, DeepMind has created AlphaFold, a system that can predict the complex 3D shapes of proteins. It has also developed programs to diagnose eye diseases as effectively as top doctors.\nAlso: What is generative AI and why is it so popular? Here's everything you need to know\nWhat are large language models?\nA predominant example of AI is large language models (LLMs). These models use unsupervised machine learning and are trained on massive amounts of text to learn how human language works. Tech companies often scrape these texts from the internet for free to keep costs down -- they include articles, books, content from websites and forums, and more.\nIn the training process, LLMs process billions of words and phrases to learn patterns and relationships between them, enabling the models to generate human-like answers to prompts.\nBut again, keep in mind that these models are replicating common grammatical patterns and word pairings, albeit at a sophisticated level -- they aren't thinking like we do, in the sense that they cannot understand fact, logic, or common sense.\nAlso: AI will unleash the next level of human potential. Here's how\nOpenAI's recently released GPT-4o tops the Chatbot Arena leaderboard as of now. The company's GPT-4 Turbo is considered one of the most advanced LLMs, while GPT-4 is the largest LLM at supposedly 1.78 trillion parameters. ChatGPT runs on both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Gemini is powered by an LLM of the same name developed by Google, and while its number of parameters hasn't been confirmed, it's estimated to be as many as 175 trillion.\nWhat are neural networks?\nThe success of machine learning relies on neural networks. These are mathematical models whose structure and functioning are loosely based on the connections between neurons in the human brain, mimicking how they signal to one another.\nImagine a group of robots that are working together to solve a puzzle. Each is programmed to recognize a different shape or color in the puzzle pieces. A neural network is like a group of robots combining their abilities to solve the puzzle together.\nNeural networks can tweak internal parameters to change what they output. Each is fed databases to learn what it should put out when presented with certain data during training.\nAlso: Six skills you need to become an AI prompt engineer\nThese networks comprise interconnected layers of algorithms that feed data into each other. Neural networks can be trained to perform specific tasks by modifying the importance attributed to data as it passes between layers. During the training of these neural networks, the weights attached to data as it passes between layers will continue to be varied until the output from the neural network is very close to what is desired.\nAt that point, the network will have 'learned' how to carry out a particular task. The desired output could be anything from correctly labeling fruit in an image to predicting when an elevator might fail based on its sensor data.\nWhat is deep learning?\nDeep learning is part of the ML family and involves training artificial neural networks with three or more layers to perform different tasks. These neural networks are expanded into sprawling networks with a large number of deep layers that are trained using massive amounts of data.\nDeep learning models tend to have more than three layers at least and can have hundreds of layers at most. Deep learning can use supervised or unsupervised learning or both in training processes.\nAlso: What is deep learning? Everything you need to know\nBecause deep learning technology can learn to recognize complex patterns in data using AI, it is often used in natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and image recognition.\nWhat is conversational AI?\nConversational AI refers to systems programmed to have conversations with a user and are trained to listen (input) and respond (output) in a conversational manner. Conversational AI uses NLP to understand and respond naturally.\nAlso: Why conversational AI is now ready for prime time\nSome examples of conversational AI are chatbots like Gemini, smart speakers with a voice assistant like Amazon Alexa, or virtual assistants on your smartphone like Siri.\nWhat AI services are available to use?\nConsumers and businesses alike have a wealth of AI services available to expedite tasks and add convenience to day-to-day life -- you probably have something in your home that uses AI in some capacity.\nHere are some common examples of AI available to the public, both free and for a cost:\n- Voice assistants: Amazon Alexa on the Echo device on your shelf, Apple's Siri on your iPhone, and Google Assistant on a Pixel device all use natural language processing to understand and respond to your questions or commands.\n- Chatbots: AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Perplexity are another form of virtual assistant that can interact with people and, in some cases, hold human-like conversations, even mimicking empathy and concern.\n- Language translation: Services like Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Amazon Translate, and ChatGPT use machine learning to translate text.\n- Productivity: Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 is a great example of an LLM used as an AI productivity tool embedded within Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, Excel, Teams, and more to automate tasks. For example, simply entering 'Email the team about the latest status on the project' will trigger Copilot to automatically gather information from emails and documents to generate a text with your request.\n- Image and video recognition: Different programs use AI to find information about the content in images and videos, such as faces, text, and objects. Clarifai, which employs machine learning to organize unstructured data from sources, and Amazon Rekognition, an AWS service that lets users upload images to receive information, are two examples of this.\n- Software development: Many developers have been using ChatGPT to write and debug code for over a year, but many other AI tools are available to make a programmer's job easier. One example is the AI pair programmer GitHub Copilot by OpenAI Codex, a generative language model that can write code faster with less effort by autocompleting comments and code instantly.\n- Building a business: Many companies are creating AI tools specifically for businesses, like OpenAI's GPT-4 API, or Amazon Bedrock, a suite of cloud-based AI tools for developers.\nAlso: The best free AI courses (and whether AI 'micro-degrees' and certificates are worth it)\nWhat company is leading the AI race?\nWith generative AI taking off, several companies are working competitively in the space -- both legacy tech firms and startups. While each is developing too quickly for there to be a static leader, here are some of the major players.\nOpenAI\nUnsurprisingly, OpenAI has made a huge impact in AI after making its powerful generative AI tools available for free, including ChatGPT and Dall-E 3, an AI image generator.\nAlso: Have 10 hours? IBM will train you in AI fundamentals - for free\nAnthropic\nAnthropic created Claude, a powerful group of LLMs, and is considered a primary competitor of OpenAI. The company focuses on safety and ethical concerns in its AI research.\nAlphabet\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, has its hands in several different AI systems through companies including DeepMind, Waymo, and Google.\nAlso: Ready to upskill? Look to the edge (where it's not all about AI)\nGoogle had a rough start in the AI chatbot race with an underperforming tool called Google Bard, originally powered by LaMDA. The company then switched the LLM behind Bard twice -- the first time for PaLM 2, and then for Gemini, the LLM currently powering it. With the last change, Google also renamed the bot Bard for Gemini.\nAlso: What is Gemini? Everything you should know about Google's new AI model\nDeepMind continues to pursue AGI. It's developed machine-learning models for Document AI, optimized the viewer experience on Youtube, made AlphaFold available for researchers worldwide, and more.\nThough you may not hear of Alphabet's AI endeavors in the news every day, its work in deep learning and AI in general has the potential to change the future for human beings.\nMicrosoft\nAside from creating Microsoft Copilot, the company provides a suite of AI tools for developers on Azure, such as platforms for developing machine learning, data analytics, conversational AI, and customizable APIs that achieve human parity in computer vision, speech, and language.\nAlso: Microsoft CEO Nadella: 'Expect us to incorporate AI in every layer of the stack'\nMicrosoft has also invested heavily in OpenAI's development. The tech giant uses GPT-4 in Copilot, formerly known as Bing chat, and in an advanced version of Dall-E 3 to generate images through Microsoft Designer.\nApple\nApple has also entered the space most recently with its AI-upgraded line of iPads and potential new announcements to come at WWDC.\nOther companies\nOther firms are making strides in artificial intelligence, including Baidu, Alibaba, Cruise, Lenovo, Tesla, and more.\nHow will AI change the world?\nAt the rate and scale it's being applied, AI will impact how we work, shop, and consume media, and our privacy, our health, and more. As with most historical shifts, the benefits, downsides, and potential harms are mixed.\nEvery advancement in technology has changed the nature of work. By automating certain tasks, AI is transforming the day-to-day work lives of people across industries, and creating new roles (and rendering some obsolete). In creative fields, for example, generative AI reduces the cost, time, and human input to make marketing and video content.\nAlso: 12 reasons AI taking on more work doesn't mean it replaces you\nAI is increasingly playing a role in our healthcare systems and medical research. The technology could help make care more scalable and accessible. Doctors and radiologists could make cancer diagnoses using fewer resources, spot genetic sequences related to diseases, and identify molecules that could lead to more effective medications, potentially saving countless lives.\nAlso: How AI hallucinations could help create life-saving antibiotics\nThe tech is also creating new questions about how we keep all kinds of data -- even our thoughts -- private. AI has made facial recognition and surveillance commonplace, causing many experts to advocate banning it altogether. At the same time that AI is heightening privacy and security concerns, the technology is also enabling companies to make strides in cybersecurity software.\nAs models -- and the companies that build them -- get more powerful, users call for more transparency around how they're created, and at what cost. The practice of companies scraping images and text from the internet to train their models has prompted a still-unfolding legal conversation around licensing creative material.\nNeural networks can be used to realistically replicate someone's voice or likeness without their consent, making deepfakes and misinformation a present concern, especially for upcoming elections.\nBecause AI makes automation so easy on a large scale, researchers and tech employees share concerns about its role in weapons manufacturing and warfare.\nAlso: The ethics of generative AI: How we can harness this powerful technology\nWill an AI steal your job?\nThe possibility of artificially intelligent systems replacing a considerable chunk of modern labor is a credible near-future possibility.\nWhile commonplace AI won't replace all jobs, what seems certain is that AI will change the nature of work, with the only question being how rapidly and profoundly automation will alter the workplace.\nAlso: These are the jobs most likely to be taken over by AI\nHowever, artificial intelligence can't run independently. While many jobs with routine, repetitive data work might be automated, workers in other jobs can use tools like generative AI to become more productive and efficient.\nThere is a broad range of opinions among AI experts about how quickly artificially intelligent systems will surpass human capabilities.\nAlso: Can AI be a team player in collaborative software development?"

      "text": "Changing these 10 settings on my Pixel phone greatly improved the user experience\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Google Pixel phones are notorious for having hidden settings that can greatly enhance the user experience.\n- The list includes options for ramping up the display refresh rate, optimizing the battery life, and gestures.\n- I demo them on a Pixel 9a running on Android 15, but newer and older software versions should have similar capabilities.\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nWith Google expected to announce new Pixel phones this week, you may be wondering if now is the best time to upgrade and switch phones. Perhaps a better question to ask is how you can optimize your current device to make it last longer.\nLike any Pixel phone, the best features often aren't enabled by default. I've tested generations of Google Pixel phones, and to achieve the best user experience, you almost always have to do a bit of digging and research.\nAlso: After owning every Google Pixel flagship, here's why 2025 will be a turning point for me\nThat's why I've done the hard work for you and gathered the best, most effective tips below, all of which are based on a Pixel 9a running Android 15 and 16. Depending on which Pixel model and Android version you're using, the exact menu locations may vary slightly, but the settings themselves are widely available across recent Pixel generations.\n1. Enable Smooth Display\nPixels continue to ship with a brilliant Actua 120Hz OLED screen set to a more conservative 60Hz by default. It's fine for battery conservation, but if you want buttery-smooth scrolling and animations that show off the screen's full potential, turn on Smooth Display.\nAlso: 7 Google Pixel phone settings you should change immediately (and how to do it)\nGo to Settings > Display > Smooth Display and toggle it on. You'll immediately notice a boost in responsiveness when scrolling through social feeds or navigating the UI.\n2. Customize Quick Tap\nThe Pixel's Quick Tap feature lets you double-tap anywhere on the back of the phone to trigger customizable actions -- but it's not enabled by default. You can set it to launch the camera, take a screenshot, pause music, or open your favorite app.\nAlso: My 7 favorite new Android 16 features include delights for every Pixel user\nGo to Settings > System > Gestures > Quick Tap, then turn it on and choose your preferred shortcut. I set mine to toggle the flashlight, which comes in very handy.\n3. Maximize battery life with Adaptive Battery and Extreme Saver\nPixels already have solid battery life, but Google's battery-saving tools take it even further. Adaptive Battery learns which apps you use most and cuts power to the rest. Extreme Battery Saver shuts down predetermined non-essential apps to stretch power for days.\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nEnable both in Settings > Battery > Battery Saver > Adaptive Battery and Battery Saver > Extreme Battery Saver. You can also set schedules for them to activate automatically when needed.\n4. Personalize the lock screen with At a Glance\nThe Pixel's lock screen can become a mini command center if you turn on its smarter widgets. At a Glance can show flight info, weather alerts, calendar events, and more.\nAlso: I upgraded to Android 16 - here's what I love and what's still missing\nAll of this happens through the Pixel Launcher. On the home screen, tap and hold any open space and select Home settings, then tap the settings icon for At a Glance. There, you can manage what kinds of information will appear and what data sources it taps into (with your permission, of course).\nAs a bonus, your home screen will also showcase this info in the At a Glance widget, so you're more likely to catch those reminders and updates.\n5. Enhance Now Playing for even greater song identification\nNow Playing is a cool feature that auto-detects songs playing around you. The phone displays that information on your lock screen passively. Even though the database is impressive and stored fully on-device, it can't identify every song out there. That's where Google Search comes in.\nAlso: I changed 8 settings on my Pixel phone to dramatically improve battery life\nHead to Settings > Display > Lock Screen > Now Playing and activate Identify songs playing nearby. Then, turn on Show search button on Lock Screen. The next time Now Playing comes up short, tap the lock screen icon to send that audio fingerprint to Google Search for a second opinion. It doesn't always work, but when it does, you'll be glad you did.\n6. Enable app suggestions on the home screen\nThe Pixel Launcher can surface app suggestions based on personal context like location, time of day, and your usage habits.\nAlso: 6 Android home screen launchers that are better than your default\nTap and hold an open space on the home screen and go to Home settings > Suggestions. Enable Suggestions on Home Screen, then remove at least one static icon from the bottom row on your Home Screen. That spot will turn yellow and begin to dynamically shift depending on usage patterns. You can even apply this to the whole row if you want.\n7. Set up Live Translate and Interpreter Mode\nTensor-powered Pixels support offline translation tools. Live Translate lets you automatically translate text messages in real time.\nAlso: 6 hidden Android features every user should know - and how they make life easier\nGo to Settings > System > Live Translate and Add a language. Depending on your selections, you'll unlock different features like in-message translation, camera view translation, and Live Caption translation for videos. Interpreter mode still requires Google Assistant, which is becoming less central now that Gemini is taking over.\n8. Change your lock screen privacy settings\nBy default, notifications appear on your lock screen, which means others might see your messages. I always adjust this setting on my new Pixel devices.\nGo to Settings > Notifications and set Sensitive notifications to Off. This keeps the sender and app visible but hides the message contents. For maximum privacy, go to Notifications on lock screen and select Don't show any notifications.\n9. Use caller ID and spam ID to save time and sanity\nPixel phones actively filter spam and unknown numbers. With Caller ID and Spam, Google flags robocalls and other junk before you even answer.\nAlso: Your Android phone is getting a huge security upgrade for free - what's new\nOpen the Phone app > Settings > Caller ID and Spam. Enable See caller and spam ID, and those incoming calls will be given a bright red warning that's impossible to ignore. If your Pixel shows the option to turn on Filter spam calls, I recommend activating that, which prevents those calls from ringing your phone, instead sending them directly to voicemail.\n10. Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices\nThis one is for the Pixel superfans out there. If you own multiple Pixel devices signed in with the same Google account, you can sync notification dismissals across them.\nGo to Settings > Notifications > Dismiss notifications across Pixel devices. Toggle on Dismiss on this device, grant notification access, and choose the apps you want synced. Make sure to repeat the process on your other Pixel devices, and you'll never see the same notification twice between them.\nAlso: Sick of ads on Android? Change these 5 settings for more privacy - fast\nA few small tweaks can go a long way toward making your new Pixel feel faster, smarter, and more personal. Whether it's your first Pixel or, like me, you've lost count at this point, taking a moment to dig into these settings helps unlock some of the best of what Google offers.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.\nFollow my latest tech reviews and projects across social media.

      "text": "I upgraded my Pixel 9 Pro to Android 16 - here's what I love (and what's still missing)\nAndroid 16 looked to be one of the most impressive upgrades to the mobile operating system in recent times. Google teased some seriously cool features that would elevate Android to the next level. However, although some of those expected features made their way to the final release, some did not.\nBecause some of the more hotly anticipated features have yet to materialize, Android 16 seems (on the surface) to be kinda blah. But don't be fooled. Even though the big UI changes were held back, there's still a lot to love about what was released.\nAlso: Your Android phone just got a major feature upgrade for free - including these Pixel models\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Google released Android 16 early. Usually, those major updates are held back until late summer/fall. (Android 15 was released in September 2024.) Why did Google release this latest update three months early? It's pretty simple: With new Android devices set to release this summer, it's now a safe bet they'll ship with the latest release.\nWhen the Pixel 9 line of phones was released last year, they shipped with Android 14 because 15 wasn't ready. That was a big disappointment to Pixel fans everywhere. To avoid this, Google released a \"version\" of Android 16 to ensure it would be ready for the release of the Pixel 10 phones.\nIn addition, Google has decided to speed up the release of Android, with two releases each year (probably so they can ensure the latest Pixel devices always have the latest version).\nWith that out of the way, let's first talk about what I love in Android 16.\nWhat's to love?\nOK, the \"what's to love\" section is a bit thin at the moment. But that doesn't mean it's not important, because Android 16 brings a few new features that are key to user security. With Android 16, securing your phone became a whole lot easier.\nWithin Settings > \"Security & privacy,\" you'll find an entry called Advanced Protection. When enabled, this all-or-nothing security feature helps defend against online attacks, malicious applications, insecure connections, and other threats. But, like I said, this is all-or-nothing. When you enable Advanced Protection, it's all in, and you can't customize it. That's fine for the majority of users, but you'll want to understand three things:\nAlso: These apps are quietly draining your phone battery - how to find and shut them down\n- Apps on your device can see if Advanced Protection is enabled.\n- Devices with 2G protection available will have 2G connections blocked (with the exception of emergency calling).\n- Some websites may not load properly.\nUnless you have a good reason not to enable Advanced Protection, I highly recommend you do so (it does require a restart).\nThere's also less clutter in the notification shade now because notifications are automatically bundled for each app. This will help to keep your notifications organized and looking less like an alphabet soup of information.\nAndroid 16 also improves battery life. With Pixel devices, there's even a new \"Battery health\" page (Settings > Battery > Battery health) that displays your battery percentage, allows you to change charging optimization and enable battery health assistance, and gives you battery health tips.\nAlso: How to clear your Android phone's cache and make it feel like new\nSpeaking of battery, Android 16 better uses AI to help optimize your battery, so you'll get even more usage from a full charge. I've noticed the difference. Thanks to Android's AI, I'm finding my battery drains a bit slower than it did in Android 15. Since upgrading, I've consistently ended my day (which, granted, comes around 6 p.m. when I dock my phone) in the 70% area (as opposed to the 60% range).\nFor those who use the Linux system on Android, the terminal app now has a tabbed interface, which is really handy. With the tabbed UI, you can run an SSH session in one tab while doing other things in other tabs.\nOK, now that I've told you about some of the features that found their way into Android 16, let's talk about what didn't.\nWhat's missing?\nThe big thing missing is Material 3 Expressive. This was supposed to be the big change for Android, building on Material Design and adding more naturally feeling animations, new icon shapes, background blur effects, improved color themes, home screen enhancements, and UI redesigns for many Google apps.\nI was excited about this feature (especially the background blur effects), but alas, it has yet to arrive. When will it arrive? The closest estimation is \"later this year.\" If I had to guess, Material 3 Expressive will arrive in time for the Pixel 10 release. Surely Google wants to provide the full Android 16 experience with its new devices; otherwise, it would be perceived as a failure to deliver.\nAlso: Why the Android 16 design overhaul has me more excited than ever\nAnother big feature that's missing in this first Android 16 release is Desktop Mode, similar to Samsung's DeX mode. Desktop Mode is exactly what it sounds like: Plug your Android Phone into an external display, and you'll experience a desktop-like environment.\nSadly, not yet. You won't even find the \"Enable desktop experience features\" option in Settings > System > Developer options (which is where it was in the beta).\nLooks like we're going to have to wait for those two features (which were often touted as the biggest new additions to Android 16).\nPatience, patience, patience\nIn this never-ending cycle of releases, it gets harder and harder to remain patient. I'm fairly certain we'll see these two big features arrive when the Pixel 10 devices are released, so it should only be a few short months. Even so, those two missing pieces make the release of Android 16 feel a bit uninspired. When those two additions find their way into the OS, however, it will feel like a brand new OS.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

Instead, it competes by adding quality-of-life features -- a couple of which are industry-firsts for a foldable phone.\nIf you are ready to upgrade from a slab phone to a foldable one, now is the best time to do so. However, it can be confusing to make a decision when both Google and Samsung book-style foldables are so good this year.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nHere's how the new Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold compares to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, and which one is the best for you.\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nYou should buy the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold if\u2026\n1. You work in a dust-prone environment\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first book-style foldable to sport an IP68 rating, which means it is truly resistant against minute dust particles. In comparison, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rated IP48 for dust and water resistance, so it is protected against solid particles bigger than 1 millimeter. Since dust particles are smaller than 1mm, there's no guarantee that a Z Fold 7 will do well against dust.\nAlso: Google just settled the foldable phone debate with one number -- and I hope Samsung is watching\nIf you live in a place susceptible to dust or work in a dusty environment, the Google foldable will serve you better. It isn't dustproof, per se, but you can get extra peace of mind when using it in those environments.\n2. You are shifting from an iPhone\nIf you can't wait for a foldable iPhone and want to switch to a book-style foldable this year, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the phone to buy. While switching to a Samsung foldable is equally easy/tedious, you'll be able to retain your iPhone's MagSafe-compatible accessories if you buy the Google foldable.\nThe Pixel 10 series comes with a new feature called PixelSnap. It is like MagSafe, where you get magnets to attach a slew of accessories. The new tech is based on Qi2 standards and offers 15W wireless charging on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. So, if you have MagSafe-compatible charging pads, power banks, or even tripods, they should theoretically be compatible with the new Google phones. This makes shifting to an Android foldable easier for an iPhone user.\n3. You want a more affordable folding phone\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best (if not the best) book-style foldables you can buy right now. It weighs less than most slab flagship phones and feels like a 'normal' phone in the hand. But it also carries a massive $2000 price tag. If you don't want to spend two grand on your new phone, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the way to go.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nThe new Google foldable undercuts its Samsung rival by $200. The base 256GB storage variant is priced at $1,800. You can currently purchase the Galaxy Z Fold 7 for as low as $1,700 on Amazon, but that's the current discount price. Once it goes on sale, you should be able to find discounts on the Pixel foldable, too.\n4. You want to use all the Gemini AI features for a year\nIf you are new to the AI world and want to try the best of Google AI features for free, Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the way to go. The company is offering a year's worth of Gemini AI Pro subscription for free with its Pixel 10 Pro series. This means you can get enhanced features like access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Veo 3 for AI-generated videos, 2TB of cloud storage, and previews of upcoming AI tools. By contrast, Samsung is giving six months of free access to the same service with its Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nYou should buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 if\u2026\n1. You want the slimmest and lightest folding phone\nI love my Galaxy Z Fold 7 for its slim and light design. In fact, it is more comfortable to hold and use than big flagship phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Samsung's own Galaxy S25 Ultra. At 215 grams, it is one of the most comfortable phones to use on the market right now. Plus, it measures just 8.9mm when folded and 4.2mm when unfolded, which feels surreal at times.\nAlso: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\nSamsung has almost perfected the form factor with its latest foldable. If you want a foldable phone without the foldable design quirks, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the phone for you (if you are a right-hander, because hinge edges are still very sharp for left-handed people).\n2. A folding phone's crease bothers you\nWhen I first unboxed the Galaxy Z Fold 7, I was amazed by the inner screen's flatness when I rubbed my hand over it. If you have used a folding phone before but couldn't live with it because of a gigantic crease running down the middle of its big screen, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be a breath of fresh air for you.\nSamsung's new folding phone features the smallest crease in its segment. You can still see it at certain angles, but it won't bother you at all. In comparison, Google's crease situation still needs work.\n3. You want a polished suite of AI features\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 can run Gemini, but the Pixel 10 Pro Fold can't run Galaxy AI features. That's not to say the Google phone doesn't have exclusives. The new Magic Cue and Camera Coach features are worth trying.\nAlso: PixelSnap is the MagSafe for Android phones we've been waiting for - here's our first look\nHowever, Galaxy AI has a more tried-and-tested suite of comparatively more polished AI features, such as AI Select, a damn good object eraser, and more. You can also avail free six months of Gemini AI Pro to try Veo 3, NotebookLM, etc., with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.\n4. You want to buy a foldable in the next few weeks\nIf you want to buy a new folding phone in the next month, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is your only choice because the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't go on sale till October 9. That's seven weeks after launch. By contrast, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is already available and might persuade potential Pixel buyers, especially at the new price.\nI have yet to use the Pixel 10 Pro Fold as a daily driver, so I don't have an opinion on the cameras or battery life. While it packs a bigger cell than its counterpart, I'll only be able to tell the difference after I have used it in daily life. Both phones run Android 16 out of the box and are promised to receive up to seven years of OS and Android security updates, so they should last long."

Finally, Android is invited to the magnetic snap party, with the Pixel 10 being the first Android to support wireless charging with a magnetic snap and the Qi2 charging standard. Google is launching Pixelsnap alongside three accessories to start, with an entire ecosystem of branded accessories coming down the road.\nSince the technology here is based on the Qi2 wireless charging standard, any of the MagSafe accessories previously marketed for iPhones will work on the Pixel 10. This opens up a ton of options for Android users who were previously relegated to workarounds and third-party products with varying degrees of success.\nThe Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) announced its pursuit of a standardized system for Apple and Android devices as far back as two years ago, but magnetic Qi2 charging technology built into the phones has been sorely missing from Android devices for years.\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but Google just sold me on the Pixel 10 with these features\nThis is despite the fact that Androids were the first to offer wireless charging over 10 years ago, but have since been outpaced by the iPhone's MagSafe feature, which has spawned an entire ecosystem of products from wallets to chargers to other accessories.\nGoogle's branded products releasing today include the Pixelsnap ring stand for $29, which just props your phone up on a surface and acts as a secondary grip, the Pixelsnap charger that snaps to the back of the phone but has a wired connection for $39, and a combo charger with a stand for $69.\nYou can expect a host of new products in the Pixelsnap ecosystem soon, including everything we see from MagSafe products like car mounts, grips, wallets, and other unique accessories.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nAll of the new Pixel 10 models will support PixelSnap wireless charging, reaching speeds of up to 25W, the Qi2 standard for both iPhones and Android devices.\nFor Apple, this means losing its majority market share in the MagSafe accessory category, since many of the devices that were previously marketed for the iPhone will now work on the Pixel 10. If additional Android models open up to this feature (and they most certainly will), it will no longer be a selling point unique to the iPhone."

No, not Apple's product launch -- that's next month. I'm talking about Made by Google 2025. The tech giant held its annual event on Wednesday, where it showed off its upcoming releases; namely the Pixel 10 series, Pixel Watch 4, and the Pixel Buds 2a.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nWe managed to get a sneak peek at the devices ahead of the big day, and we're here to share everything we know. Admittedly, none of the hardware announcements are super surprising. We've had a pretty good idea that the aforementioned devices were going to be headliners, especially since Google unveiled the Pixel 10 series early in July.\nIt isn't all hardware reveals, however, as the event packs a few notable surprises -- including new smartphone features like Magic Cue and Pixelsnap. Google provided a more entertaining look during its presentation, but here's a quick breakdown of all the products and software updates being shown off at Made by Google.\n1. Google Pixel 10 series: Pro, XL, and Fold\nGoogle's Pixel 10 series is the star of the show. The line consists of four models: the base Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Unlike the previous generation, this batch isn't an overhaul of the Pixel line. It primarily builds on what the Pixel 9 line brought to the table.\nPixel 10: Starting with the base model, the Pixel 10 sports a 6.3-inch Actua display, 12GB of RAM, and a new 5x telephoto camera alongside the 50MP wide and 48MP ultrawide lenses. This new option delivers 10x optical image quality and Super Res Zoom up to 20x, letting you capture high-quality close-up shots from further away. Pricing starts at $799, and the model will be available in Obsidian (black), Indigo (blue), Frost (white), and Lemongrass (green).\nPixel 10 Pro: The Pro model is similar in size, sporting a 6.3-inch Super Actua display that outputs at a new peak brightness of 3,300 nits. Notable upgrades include 16GB of RAM, a purported 30-hour battery life, and a better 5x telephoto lens, allowing the Pixel 10 Pro to support 100x Pro Res Zoom for great-looking closeups. Prices start at $999, and it'll be available in Obsidian (black), Moonstone (gray), Porcelain (white), and Jade (green).\nAlso: I'm a longtime iPhone user, but Google just sold me on the Pixel 10 with these features\nPixel 10 Pro XL: The Pixel 10 Pro XL has many of the same features and specifications as the Pixel 10 Pro, with one major difference: It has a 6.8-inch Super Actua display. Prices start at $1,199, and it'll be available in the same colors as the 10 Pro.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is larger than the previous generation, boasting a 6.4-inch Actua outer display and an 8-inch Super Actua inner display. Google made interesting design changes, namely what it describes as a \"new gearless, high-strength hinge\" that allows the 10 Pro Fold to survive over 10 years of constant opening and closing.\nPerhaps more importantly, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first foldable phone to feature an IP68 rating, providing complete protection against dust and allowing it to survive brief submersion underwater. Its closest competitor, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, only supports an IP48 rating. Pricing for the Fold starts at $1,799, and it'll be available in two colors: Moonstone and Jade.\nAll four models run on Google's new Tensor G5 chipset, which the company says is 60% more powerful than the previous generation Tensor G4. Each smartphone boasts 30-hour battery life, key support from Gemini AI, and receives seven years of software and security updates. Preorders for the Pixel 10 series have begun, August 20, with open sales availability starting next week on August 28.\nYou will have to wait a while to order the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, as it won't be available until October 9.\n2. Magic Cue, Pixelsnap, and more AI tools\nGoogle is once again utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to elevate the user experience. This time, the company is focused on improving AI assistance on its smartphones to make certain features easier to use. Additionally, Google is making an interesting design change that could revamp the way people interact with their Pixel phones.\nAlso: How to clear your Android phone cache (and give it a serious speed boost)\nMagic Cue: Magic Cue is another personal assistant AI, but one that's more proactive. Instead of waiting for your input, the feature anticipates your needs and suggests actions or provides information \"based on the context of your phone.\" For example, let's say you're calling your airline about an upcoming flight. Magic Cue will instantly bring up your flight details during the call.\nCamera updates: All Pixel 10 models will receive two new camera features. First is Camera Coach, which will provide suggestions on how to set up shots or recommend certain camera modes to use. Auto Best Take allows the phone to combine similar photographs into one perfect image. Then there's the improved Add Me. While functioning much like before, the feature now lets you add the photographer to bigger group photos.\nPixelsnap: Pixelsnap is a new magnetic technology that will be included on all Pixel 10 phones. It allows users to snap Qi2-compatible wireless chargers, stands, and grips to the back of the device. If that sounds familiar, iPhones have supported similar technology for years.\nAlso: PixelSnap is the MagSafe for Android phones we've been waiting for - here's our first look\nTo coincide with the implementation of Pixelsnap, Google will be rolling out supporting accessories. The Pixelsnap Charger ($40) provides Qi2 wireless charging up to 25W. The Pixelsnap Charger with Stand ($70) does the same thing but sports a stable dock to support smartphones. Then there's the Pixelsnap Ring Stand ($30) for hands-free viewing. Google will also release special Pixelsnap compatible phone cases at $50 each.\n3. Google Pixel Buds 2a\nGoogle is revealing the Pixel Buds 2a, a new budget-friendly version of the Pixel Buds 2 Pro. Housed inside the familiar egg-shaped case, the company says this pair is the first A-Series earbuds to feature Active Noise Cancelation with Silent Seal 1.5 to block out outside noise. To hear the surrounding environment, users can activate Transparency Mode to allow sound to pass through.\nGoogle's Pixel Buds 2a shares multiple features with the Buds 2 Pro, including 11mm dynamic drivers, support for spatial audio, and a 5-band equalizer for adjusting the bass, treble, and other parts of the audio. The buds run on the Tensor A1 chipset and boast a 20-hour battery life with the charging case.\nAlso: I compared the new $130 Pixel Buds to Apple, Sony and Bose - here's how Google wins\nThe Pixel Buds 2a will be available on store shelves on October 9 for $130, and in two colors: Hazel (black) and Iris (light blue). Preorders open today, August 20. There is no word on when the Pixel Buds 3 Pro will roll out. However, if Google follows the same pattern with the Buds Pro and Buds 2 Pro, expect new earbuds next year.\n4. Google Pixel Watch 4\nRounding out the list is the Pixel Watch 4. Google's future wearable introduces multiple design updates and extra safety features.\nLike the Pixel Watch 3, this model sports an Actua 360 domed display made out of tough Corning Gorilla Glass. However, this generation's touchscreen is 10% larger than before and 50% brighter, boasting 3,000 nits. Its battery sees an improvement too, now lasting a purported 40 hours on a single charge for the 45mm model and 30 hours for the 41mm watch.\nAlso: I tried Pixel Watch 4 - and these are my 7 favorite upgrades in Google's new watch\nBoth sizes are gaining 25% faster charging speeds, along with a redesigned charging system that now flanks the side edge of the watch instead of the middle surface. How this plays out in the real world remains to be tested.\nThe most significant design change, however, is that the Pixel Watch 4 can actually be repaired. Google says the wearable is its \"first watch designed with serviceability in mind\" as users are able to replace the display and battery.\nMany safety features found on the Pixel Watch 4 are carryovers from the Pixel Watch 3. You have Loss of Pulse, which allows the Watch 4 to call for an ambulance if it detects that your heart has stopped beating. Fall and Crash Detection contacts emergency services if it detects that you've had a bad fall or were in a car accident.\nThere is a new feature in all this. Pixel Watch 4 LTE has an SOS satellite communication function that enables users to contact emergency services if they're ever in a location without any cellular or Wi-Fi connections.\nAlso: The best smartwatches 2025: I wore these for weeks and found the perfect one for your wrist\nThe Pixel Watch 4 will be available in two different sizes: 41mm and 45mm, with colors correlating to a certain size. The 45 Pixel Watch 4 will have three colors for its wrist bands: black, white, and gray. The 41mm Pixel Watch 4 keeps the white and black wrist bands, but also throws in Iris blue and Lemongrass green bands.\nThe 41mm Pixel Watch 4 will retail for $350, while the 45mm model will be a bit more expensive at $400. Preorders go live today, August 20. The wearable is set to hit store shelves on October 9."
