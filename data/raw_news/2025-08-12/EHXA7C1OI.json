At HyProMag USA LLC (\"HyProMag USA\"), CoTec's U.S.-based rare earth permanent magnet recycling and manufacturing joint venture, the detailed design and engineering (\"DDE\") phase remains on schedule and within budget, following the engagement of PegasusTSI Inc. and BBA USA Inc. as our EPCM partners in April.

Our Quebec based Lac Jeannine iron ore tailings and reclamation project continues to progress, permitting for the 2025 drilling program was secured and drilling commenced at the Lac Jeannine Project site on August 4, 2025. This drilling campaign aims to increase the size of the mineral resource and potentially double the life-of-mine without additional capex, unlocking substantial upside potential. In advance of the upcoming feasibility study, we are studying the application of the Salter Cyclone Multi-Gravity Separators (\"MGS\") technology for the recovery of additional iron ore from the project. Our other portfolio companies also achieved important milestones - Ceibo Inc. (\"Ceibo\"), CoTec's investment in low-carbon copper heap leaching technology, continues to progress scaled up testing at Glencore's Lomas Bayas mine and produced its first copper cathode at a demonstration plant at Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera San Ger\u00f3nimo, and MagIron LLC (\"MagIron\"), CoTec's 16.6% stake in a U.S. based iron ore concentrator with more than 20 years of feedstock, made steady progress toward completion of its NI 43-101 feasibility study. The second quarter also saw notable financing activity, with the launch of our Listed Issuer Financing Exemption offering and concurrent private placement. Subsequent to quarter-end the financing closed and was 35% oversubscribed, raising total gross proceeds of $13.5 million.

      "text": "CoTec is a next-generation resource company focused on transforming undervalued mineral assets into high-margin operations through the deployment of breakthrough extraction and processing technologies.\nOur approach targets low-grade and complex deposits that have historically been uneconomic. By leveraging technologies that dramatically reduce water and energy usage compared to traditional methods, CoTec unlocks new sources of critical minerals with improved economics and sustainability.\nWe currently hold investments in six transformative technologies and three mineral assets, providing exposure to key commodities such as rare earths, iron ore, and copper. Our strategy is to acquire and operate assets where our technologies offer a clear advantage\u2014creating value through scalability, strategic partnerships, and ultimately spinning off these businesses as standalone operations.\nCoTec is publicly listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and OTCQB under the symbols TSX-V: CTH and OTCQB: CTHCF.\nCoTec invests in disruptive, scalable technologies that have the potential to fundamentally change how minerals and metals are extracted, refined, and processed. We focus on early-stage innovations with commercial potential and back them with decades of operational experience and a highly engaged Board of Directors.\nWhat sets CoTec apart is our dual network: deep roots in the global resource extraction industry, and strong connections to technology funds, universities, innovation labs, and forward-thinking mining professionals. This unique positioning enables us to accelerate the development and deployment of next-generation technologies.\nFor more advanced technologies, CoTec pursues joint ventures and partnerships to fast-track commercial applications. In an industry often slow to adopt change, we bring an entrepreneurial mindset and a nimble approach\u2014ready to move where incumbents hesitate.\nWe scale value through a two-pronged strategy:\nCoTec is building a new kind of resource company\u2014one that brings together innovation and ownership to deliver profitability, efficiency, and long-term value.\nAt CoTec, we believe the future of resource production will be defined by innovation. We\u2019re not just following the transition\u2014we\u2019re building it, by backing breakthrough technologies that can unlock value where others can\u2019t.\nGlobal demand for critical minerals is accelerating, but traditional mining methods alone won\u2019t meet the moment. CoTec is pioneering a new model: we invest in and deploy proven, disruptive technologies that make it possible to extract and process materials more efficiently, more cleanly, and from sources previously considered uneconomic\u2014such as legacy stockpiles, tailings, and recycled material.\nWhat sets us apart is our strategy. We don\u2019t just fund technology\u2014we own it, and integrate it into undervalued assets we control, creating a clear path from innovation to production. Our goal is to build a portfolio of scalable, cost-effective operations that can meet the growing demand for critical minerals\u2014with faster timelines, lower capital intensity, and stronger margins.\nWe\u2019ve already screened hundreds of technologies, invested in only the most credible and commercially viable, and are now entering the next phase: applying them to real-world assets to create long-term value."
