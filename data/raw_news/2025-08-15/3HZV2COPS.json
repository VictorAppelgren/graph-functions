  "title": "Flintshire residents without water for second day as Wales prepares for heatwave",
  "description": "Thousands of people have been left without water for a second day due to a burst water main in Broughton.",
  "content": "Frustrated residents in Flintshire have been left without water for a second day as some parts of Wales prepare for this year's fourth heatwave. Thousands of people have been affected by a burst water main in Broughton, with residents helping deliver bottled water to others, and long queues reported at water stations. Welsh Water said the water main will be fixed on Friday afternoon, although it warned disruption could continue with supplies expected to be restored to everyone on Sunday. \"This will take time as we need to avoid causing any secondary bursts on this extensive network which is over 500km,\" it said.\n\nThe burst water main is affecting residents in Flint, Holywell, Ffynnongroyw, Greenfield, Llanerch y Mor, Mostyn, Oakenholt, Talacre, Whitford, Aston, Queensferry, Hawarden, Ewloe, Mancot, Garden City, Shotton, Northop, Deeside and the surrounding areas. Two Cymru Premier matches have also been postponed due to the disruption. Bottled water stations across Flintshire are keeping people topped up but some have seen long queues. Beth Hall, animal keeper at Greenacres Animal Park which has a variety of farm and exotic animals, said she was concerned about the impact on the animals. \"We have camels that could drink 200ml in the space of a couple of minutes. We're heavily reliant on bottled water donations,\" she said. \"We [humans] have other sources of water like fizzy drinks, but animals rely on water. \"Its affected us a lot as a business. We rely on the summer holidays to get us through winter months.\" Ricky Blackwell from Connah's Quay is part of Deeside Roundtable community group and has started delivering water to local residents. \"Obviously we go to a lot of disabled people and pensioners who haven't been able to get it, they phone up and ask for priority deliveries,\" he said. \"We put them on the list but we can't guarantee it because obviously there's such a demand at the moment. So we've taken it off our own backs to just go round and get the water out to them.\"\n\nFiona Lettsome from Queensferry has been without water since Thursday and travelled to Mold for supplies. \"I come up to my daughter's and I didn't know it had come off obviously until I saw it on the news. \"I live on my own but you still need water for things like the toilet, so I'm using my water bottle,\" she said. James Fox, from Queensferry, said his water also went off on Thursday morning. \"We've been coming since then to come and get water. There's not much we can do,\" he said.\n\nWelsh Water CEO Peter Perry has apologised to customers, and said the company was working \"around the clock\" to get water back on, as well as providing alternative supplies. He said the delay was due to the \"nature of the main\", which is 30 inches (76cm) in diameter and 16ft (5m) underground. He added the \"safety of our workforce\" had to be considered due to the complex nature of the main. The company said the repair on a large main in Broughton carried out last weekend was done to get people back on supply as quickly as possible and allow it to refill the network. \"It wasn't meant to be a temporary repair, it was meant to be a permanent repair,\" Mr Perry told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. \"Unfortunately that began to leak,\" he said, adding that engineers had planned to fix the main on Thursday evening under \"controlled conditions\" but were unable to do so.",

      "text": "'Cool spaces' provide help as Wales faces heatwaves\n- Published\nCommunities in Wales are setting up \"cool spaces\" to help people cope with the heat as they prepare for a second blast of hot weather in the space of a week.\nTemperatures are forecasted to reach 29C in Cardiff going into the weekend, after highs of 32.8C in the city on Tuesday.\nIt means some parts of Wales are set to experience their fourth heatwave of the year, although it will be cooler in north Wales and by the coast.\nOn Thursday, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) declared drought conditions in south-east Wales following the driest six-month period in decades.\nWelsh Water said there were no plans for restrictions to be placed on the use of water, however it urged people to take precautions in the heat.\n- Published1 day ago\n- Published26 July\n- Published3 days ago\nAt Caldicot's TogetherWorks community centre in Monmouthshire, manager Isla Arendell has been trying to encourage people to use the centre as a \"cool space\" where they can meet others away from the confined warmth in their homes.\n\"I suppose it's come off from the warm space during the winter, we're looking at perhaps being sort of like a cool space where people can come in, chill, we've got a lovely community garden people can sit in,\" she said.\nMore than 100 electric fans have been donated and given out at the centre, which Ms Arendell said had proved \"very popular\".\nJohn Hubbard, 72, who was attending the men's breakfast club on the site, said he has tried hard to keep his home cool.\n\"It's sort of counter to what we normally do in this country, but closing the windows, even if it's really hot, is the thing to do,\" he said.\n\"Unfortunately, our best rooms are our lounge and our bedroom face south, so we get the full blast of the sun.\"\nTony Knight, 81, added: \"I like the hot weather as long as it's not too hot. I go out every day for a walk, but if it's too hot I walk around the supermarkets and it's nice.\"\nResidents of care homes often have less choice about where they can go to keep cool.\nAt Pen-Y-Bont Care home in Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, staff member Luke Griffiths said the team tried to keep communal spaces cool with air conditioning, and focused on making sure residents stayed hydrated.\n\"We think ahead, we do monitor our residents' fluid intake, we set fluid targets for each resident, we encourage regular breaks for our staff members as well and we ensure the ventilation is correct in the building,\" he said.\nJohn Greenland, 65, is a resident at the home and said he struggled in the warm weather.\nHe said: \"I don't like it. If I'm hot I try and cool down a bit. I have a lot of drinks. I get very hot and I sweat like anything.\"\nMartha Lowman, 80, said she did not enjoy seeing predictions of high temperatures on the weather forecasts.\nShe said: \"I like to keep in the shade and drink plenty of fluids. It's exhausting really. It's quite unusual for us to have such hot weather.\n\"When I lived in Australia, it was normal out there but this is not normal for us.\"\nWhile linking climate change with specific individual extreme weather events can be difficult, scientists say climate change is generally making heatwaves hotter, longer and more frequent.\nAccording to BBC weather forecaster and meteorologist Sabrina Lee, we may have to get used to this sort of weather more often.\nShe said: \"We expect our summers to be hotter and drier. When we get heatwaves, they're expected to become more frequent and intense and there's going to be more concerns in the future when it comes to wildfires and droughts.\"\nShe added we may need to alter how we carry out tasks that we have previously taken for granted.\n\"I think the tone of my forecasts will become more serious. We expect to have to adapt in future years, so our daily routines may have to be changed.\n\"For example, when we take the dog for a walk, or if you're an outdoor worker, you have to tweak your schedule to avoid some of that heat.\"\nFor those planning to be outside in the warm weekend weather, Celyn-Mai Clement, 23, from St John Ambulance Cymru, advised people to keep hydrated and wear a hat and sunglasses to avoid eye damage.\n\"We advise that you cover up using loose light clothing but the best advice is to use sunscreen,\" she said.\nOn Thursday, environment watchdog Natural Resources Wales said it had recorded the driest six-month period since the drought of 1976.\nAs a result, the threshold has been met to put south-east Wales in to drought status.\n\"The lack of significant rainfall has taken its toll on the environment, and we are receiving reports of low flows and dry riverbeds in some locations, low groundwater levels as well as reports of fish in distress and algal blooms,\" said Rhian Thomas, of NRW.\n\"Catchments in south-east Wales have been particularly impacted, with rivers receiving very little rainfall in recent months, and the Usk and Wye recording persistently high river temperatures which can threaten fish populations.\"\nNRW added that a drier season meant wildfires could occur more easily, but it was the \"rivers where we're seeing that impact at the minute\".\nIt said that all of the water used daily comes from our river systems, so if we can limit our use at home, that can add up to have an impact.\nHowever, Welsh Water said there was currently no shortage of drinking water.\n\"We have no concerns about reservoir levels across our operating area, with most at levels close to what we would expect at this time of year,\" they said.\n\"We are managing the extra demand associated with the dry weather in terms of preserving storage within our network service reservoirs, but at this stage we have no plans to introduce any temporary use bans.\""
