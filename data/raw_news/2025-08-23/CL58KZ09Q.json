  "description": "If you think climate change is a hoax, you might believe wind turbines poison groundwater.",
  "content": "When Donald Trump recently claimed, during what was supposed to be a press conference about a European Union trade deal, that wind turbines were a \"con job\" that drive whales \"loco,\" kill birds and even people, he wasn\u2019t just repeating old myths. He was tapping into a global pattern of conspiracy theories around renewable energy\u2014particularly wind farms. (Trump calls them \u201cwindmills\u201d\u2014a climate denier trope.)\n\nLike 19th century fears that telephones would spread diseases, wind farm conspiracy theories reflect deeper anxieties about change. They combine distrust of government, nostalgia for the fossil fuel era, and a resistance to confronting the complexities of the modern world.\n\nAnd research shows that, once these fears are embedded in someone\u2019s worldview, no amount of fact-checking is likely to shift them.\n\nAlthough we\u2019ve known about climate change from carbon dioxide as probable and relatively imminent since at least the 1950s, early arguments for renewables tended to be seen more as a way of breaking the stranglehold of large fossil-fuel companies.\n\nThe idea that fossil companies would delay access to renewable energy was nicely illustrated in a classic episode of The Simpsons when Mr. Burns builds a tower to blot out the sun over Springfield, forcing people to buy his nuclear power.\n\nBack in the real world, similar dynamics were at play. In 2004, Australian Prime Minister John Howard gathered fossil fuel CEOs to help him slow the growth of renewables, under the auspices of a Low Emissions Technology Advisory Group.\n\nMeanwhile, advocates of renewables\u2014especially wind\u2014often found it difficult to build public support for wind, in part because the existing power providers (mines, oil fields, nuclear) tend to be out of sight and out of mind.\n\nPublic opposition has also been fed by health scares, such as \u201cwind turbine syndrome.\u201d Labeled a \u201cnon-disease\u201d and non-existent by medical experts, it continued to circulate for years.",

      "text": "So it appears we are to be treated to another pointless examination of a manufactured controversy in the name of health science. One can only guess at the motivations for the Federal Government announcing a NHMRC-led review of the science around the purported health effects of wind farms, but you can be sure it\u2019s not being driven by scientific curiosity.\nIn fact this review is probably the most futile bit of spending yet announced in the term of the Abbott administration and is exactly the sort of tomfoolery you might expect of a cabinet which has no room for science. Why? Because there is no controversy about the so-called Wind Turbine Syndrome. It doesn\u2019t exist as a thing. It has not, as the philosophers might say, been reified.\nWind turbines have no health effects on the surrounding populations. That\u2019s not just my personal opinion. It\u2019s the overwhelming scientific consensus. The book is closed, the story is written, the circus has folded its tents and moved on.\nIt would, however, potentially suit the Abbott Government politically to keep this manufactroversy going. The conservative side of politics in this country has a well-documented preference for fossil fuel production, largely based on economic arguments and the hope of carbon capture technology to reduce carbon emissions from current coal-fired power stations. Using fringe science to advance political ends is nothing new, but this is not a political comment column so I don\u2019t propose to stray too far from discussing that science.\nThe proverbial musty tomes of medical history are full of such exotic diagnoses as Railway Spine or the Vapours not to mention Fan Death in South Korea. Why not investigate those as well? After all, it has been a long time since the NHMRC had a look at them as well.\nThis facetious rhetorical question has a serious answer. Why does it seem ridiculous to have a Government enquiry into Fan Death, which is after all reported as the 5th most common cause of serious injury during summer in Korea, according to the Korean Consumer Protection Board?\nI submit that there is no scientific justification for any further investigation of \u2018Wind Turbine Syndrome\u2019 just as there is no reason to investigate Fan Death or Railway Spine, because they are not real diagnoses. They are cultural responses to new or unfamiliar technology. I would support an academic investigation into the sociological aspects of the phenomenon as it may help us understand how to prevent useful and essential renewable energy technology from being hindered by groups of sincerely deluded activists. But a scientific investigation? A complete and utter waste of my tax dollars, as it will not alter either the scientific consensus or the tiny, one-track minds of the denialists.\nAnd as for the Chief Scientist\u2019s report on assessing the \u2018evidence\u2019 supporting homeopathy and other implausible treatments, don\u2019t get me started. The UK parliament produced the defintive smackdown on homeopathy in 2010, but for some reason the Government is stalling the report which many (including myself) hope will stop these treatment being paid for with funds from the 30% Private Health Rebate (ie tax dollars). The delay in implementation is meant to allow for more \u2018consultation with industry\u2019. Again, it\u2019s certainly not to allow for any more scientific input, as the supporting evidence consisted of tumbleweeds 2 years ago when it started, and it\u2019s tumbleweeds all the way down still.\nThe most unsavoury aspect of this announcement is more subtle. The younger Bush administration in the USA became notorious for its disregard for the scientific process. They forced policy to drive evidence, rather than the other way around. They purportedly dictated the preferred outcomes of major environmental studies using funding threats to hold the scientists hostage. They cut funding from scientific programs that seemed \u2018pointless\u2019 to scientifically illiterate pollies and bureaucrats. The ideologically-driven ban on stem-cell research by the Bush administration set the USA back a decade in major biotech research, which also meant that the industry created by this innovation left their shores.\nMr Abbott clearly signalled his intentions prior to the election to curb free enquiry and direct research funds to \u2018useful\u2019 areas. Now he has commissioned a large scientifically futile project at his own behest, so we would be naive not to expect more of the same.\nAustralia cannot afford the luxury of a scientifcally illiterate body politic for very long. From the stump-jump plough and Coolgardie safe to the invention of WiFi, we have had to use technological solutions to the difficulties of living in this country. We have punched well above our weight for a very long time thanks to our outstanding record of scientific innovation, which has been enabled by solid support from Governments which have always judged it (rightly in my view) to be a critical path to keeping and improving our quality of life.\nUntil now, it seems. When junk science can be used as a prop in a political debate, and jobs in outdated and harmful industries are valued more highly than jobs in the industries of the future. It\u2019s not too late for the PM to reverse this apparent willingness to use bad science as a political tool, and to unwind his Government\u2019s disregard for the proud track record of Australian scientific innovation but until then we will pay the price for his War on Smart."

How do we know? It\u2019s in the leaked minutes of the LETAG group\u2026\nWhat do I mean? The \u201cLow Emissions Technology Advisory Group\u201d (LETAG) that he\u2019d set up. He called a meeting in May 2004 asking for oil company help in killing off the renewables he had been forced to accept as part of the energy mix\u2026\nThe amount of carbon dioxide in the air was roughly xxxppm. As of 2023 it is 423ppm, but check here for daily measures.\nThe context was that John Howard was under pressure to say yes to a national emissions trading scheme. One had been defeated in 2000, thanks to his henchman Nick Minchin, but this time the whole Cabinet \u2013 the Treasurer, the Foreign Affairs, the Environment guy etc were all united in agreeing that Australia should have a national emissions trading scheme. Howard didn\u2019t want it, so he delayed the decision by a month. He then consulted with a couple of his mates, stiffened his spine, came back and afterwards and said \u201cno.\u201d And was able to do it, though the action was then pilloried and used by Labour in 2006-7, to show just how anti climate action Howard had been.\nBy the way, we know about this meeting, but not from its memoirs or anyone else\u2019s. But because the information is contained in the minutes of a meeting of the Low Emissions Technology Advisory Group. The minutes were not usually released, but these were leaked.

      "text": "Abstract\nReaching net-zero targets requires massive increases in wind energy production, but efforts to build wind farms can meet stern local opposition. Here, inspired by related work on vaccinations, we examine whether opposition to wind farms is associated with a world view that conspiracies are common (\u2018conspiracy mentality\u2019). In eight pre-registered studies (collective N = 4,170), we found moderate-to-large relationships between various indices of conspiracy beliefs and wind farm opposition. Indeed, the relationship between wind farm opposition and conspiracy beliefs was many times greater than its relationship with age, gender, education and political orientation. Information provision increased support, even among those high in conspiracy mentality. However, information provision was less effective when it was presented as a debate (that is, including negative arguments) and among participants who endorsed specific conspiracy theories about wind farms. Thus, the data suggest preventive measures are more realistic than informational interventions to curb the potentially negative impact of conspiracy beliefs.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nMain\nFor many countries, achieving net-zero targets will require an extraordinary ramping up of energy sourced from wind. For example, when Princeton University modelled a pathway to net-zero emissions in the United States that relied entirely on renewable energy, they calculated it would require over 1 million square kilometres of land, roughly the size of Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois and Louisiana combined1. In Germany, the current government agreed to designate 2% of the country\u2019s landscape for the construction of wind farms2. The scale of escalation suggests a fundamental transformation in people\u2019s exposure to\u2014and relationship with\u2014wind farms in the future.\nExisting research suggests that people are positive about wind energy in the abstract, but when it comes to actually establishing wind farms in local communities, there has been substantial resistance, to the point where many proposals have been killed off3. In some cases, resistance has been amplified by organized campaigns of disinformation (for example, about negative health consequences of wind farms)4,5. These pockets of resistance might be early red flags for what other nations may soon experience once wind farms become a more visible and salient part of people\u2019s lived experiences. Just as nations will need to massively ramp up investment in wind farms to meet renewable energy targets, so too does the scientific community need to ramp up its ability to anticipate (and defuse) factors that lead to wind farm resistance.\nIn other domains, it has long been understood that people\u2019s attitudes towards science and emerging technologies are shaped by their cultural and ideological world views6,7,8,9. One world view that has become a particular focus of attention is what we refer to here as \u2018conspiracy mentality\u2019, the notion that it is commonplace for groups of elites with bad intentions to conduct elaborate hoaxes on the public and to do so in near-perfect secrecy10,11,12. People who subscribe to this world view are more likely to be sceptical about climate science and (in particular) about vaccines9,13,14. This general, relatively stable world view manifests in beliefs in specific conspiracy theories regarding concrete situations or topics15. In many Western countries, for example, up to a quarter of variance in people\u2019s attitudes towards vaccines can be explained merely by knowing whether they believe Princess Diana was murdered or the 9/11 attacks were an inside job13. Knowing the powerful role of conspiracy mentality and specific conspiracy beliefs in understanding attitudes towards other large-scale social initiatives, it seems overdue to examine its role in people\u2019s attitudes towards wind farms.\nIn this Article, we report research in which we examine the relationship between several indicators of conspiracy beliefs and opposition to wind farms. In addition, we test experimentally the effects of different types of information provision on participants\u2019 attitudes. We find that conspiracy mentality explains a large portion of people\u2019s resistance to vote in favour of a potential wind farm in their community. Believing in a specific conspiracy theory around the construction of the wind farm does so to an even larger degree. Informing people about the benefits of the wind farm has a considerable positive effect on their intentions to vote for the wind farms, particularly among those with a strong conspiracy mentality. These effects are smaller when people are also provided with counterarguments or when they believe in a specific conspiracy theory about the wind farm. Overall, our research suggests that conspiracy beliefs play a major role in understanding resistance to wind farms and sheds light on how to counteract this opposition.\nConspiracy mentality and resistance to wind farms\nThere are at least two reasons to assume that wind farms are vulnerable to being caught in the net of suspicion implied by a conspiracy mentality. First, conspiracy theories have long circulated about wind turbines, even if this phenomenon has largely evaded academic attention. For example, despite dozens of academic studies indicating that wind farms pose no threat to human health16,17, conspiracy theories persist that they contribute to congenital abnormalities, fatigue and/or cancer, claims that have been propagated by anti-wind farm lobby groups and echoed by senior politicians including former US President Donald Trump5,18. More mainstream conspiracy theories assert that politicians are pushing ineffective technologies for cynical financial reasons. High conspiracy mentality predisposes people to believe such misinformation15.\nSecond, attitudes towards wind farms appear to be trust sensitive; analyses of surveys, experiments and interview data converge to argue that support for wind farms is primarily shaped by people\u2019s sense of equity, integrity-based trust, justice and fairness19,20,21. Given that conspiracy mentality is characterized by distrust of elites12,22\u2014and given that trust in the involved parties (for example, local governments) is a key driver of the acceptance of wind farms19,20\u2014it seems reasonable to expect that people with a stronger conspiracy mentality might be more opposed to the construction of wind farms in their community. Similarly, wind farms could be rejected because wind energy is largely accepted by societies, and holding views in counterpoint to the mainstream is related to conspiracy mentality23,24.\nWe tested this prediction in eight pre-registered studies in Germany (collective N = 4,170). The German context is ideally suited to examine this question because of Germany\u2019s leading role in wind farm technology; in 2020, it produced 131 TWh (103.7 TWh onshore), which amounts to 23.7% of the country\u2019s gross energy consumption25. Germany ranks third in terms of installed wind power capacities26, and the current government has envisaged to nearly double the capacity until 203027. However, there have been examples of citizen resistance towards wind farms in Germany28,29, and occasionally, such protests have been seized upon by far-right populist parties as part of a broader sentiment of alienation and resentment in coal mining communities30. In short, policy around wind energy is a major topic in Germany, one that is discussed both at the grassroots level and in official political debates. Understanding the psychology of wind farm resistance in an early adopter such as Germany will provide important clues to what might occur in other countries seeking rapid decarbonization.\nWe asked participants to imagine a scenario in which the construction of five wind turbines was planned close to their community and to indicate the likelihood (0\u2013100%) with which they would vote in favour of the wind turbines in a local referendum. In addition, we measured participants\u2019 conspiracy mentality (for example, \u2018Politicians and other leaders are nothing but the string puppets of powers operating in the background\u2019; \u2018Most people do not recognize to what extent our life is determined by conspiracies that are concocted in secret\u2019)12. None of the items used in this measure referred to wind farms or energy policies.\nStudies 1\u20137 were conducted with convenience samples of German adults. When aggregated, they revealed a strong negative correlation, r(2,055) = \u22120.34, p < 0.001, such that acceptance of wind turbines was lower among those with a stronger conspiracy mentality. To obtain a more accurate estimation of this relationship in the German population, Study 8 (N = 2,115) used a nationally quota-balanced sample regarding gender, age, education and state. We also controlled for political orientation, given that conspiracy mentality is particularly strong among conservatives in Germany31. On average, participants in this sample indicated modestly high support for the building of wind turbines (mean (M) = 64.95, standard deviation (SD) = 31.30). However, supporting our prediction, a higher conspiracy mentality strongly predicted lower support for the building of wind turbines, unstandardized regression coefficient (b) = \u22127.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) [\u22128.90; \u22126.98], Student\u2019s t(2,106) = \u221216.23, p < 0.001, Pearson correlation coefficient (r) = \u22120.33, over and above age, gender, education, and political orientation (Fig. 1). This means that conspiracy mentality (M = 4.01, SD = 1.34) was associated with lower support for wind turbines by 11 percentage points per standard deviation (for example, from 65% to 54% from people with average conspiracy mentality to people with 1 SD above average).\nEffects of providing arguments in favour of wind farms\nThe substantial and robust relationship between conspiracy mentality and rejection of wind farms raises the question of how this resistance might be reduced. Usually, there are campaigns preceding local referenda in which stakeholders provide information supporting their position to the local population. Indeed, there is initial evidence that such communication can help increase wind farm acceptance3,32. One important factor that was identified in these studies was the local authority\u2019s support for the wind project. It is, however, questionable whether such support would be beneficial to persuading people with a conspiracy mentality, as there is some evidence that they react defensively towards communication provided by sources of power33.\nIn Studies 1\u20138, we also tested whether communication that provides arguments in favour of wind turbines would increase likelihood of voting for wind turbines and whether this depended on participants\u2019 conspiracy mentality. We provided participants in one experimental condition with a leaflet (written by the authors but inspired by real information campaigns; Supplementary Methods) about hypothetical planned wind turbines said to be issued by the local municipality. The leaflet featured arguments about, for instance, potential for reducing carbon emissions, security of energy supply and opportunities for financial profit of citizens and municipality. In a merged analysis across all studies (N = 4,170), moderated multiple regressions showed that providing pro arguments about wind turbines significantly increased participants\u2019 willingness to vote in favour of constructing them, compared with a no-information control, b = 4.66, 95% CI [3.74; 5.57], t(4,164) = 9.98, p < 0.001. Interestingly, an interaction with conspiracy mentality emerged, b = 0.76, 95% CI [0.05; 1.46], t(4,164) = 2.11, p = 0.035, such that the effect of communication was greatest among those with a stronger conspiracy mentality (Fig. 2). In other words, a communication that took participants roughly 2 minutes (median 112 seconds) to read was highly effective in reducing the negative relationship between conspiracy mentality and wind farm acceptance.\nTo probe the robustness of these effects, Study 2 examined what would happen if the information was provided by industry (as opposed to government); the effects reported above remained unchanged (Supplementary Table 7). In Study 3, we examined what happens if the referendum was initiated by local opponents of the project (as opposed to supporters). Again, the main effects of conspiracy mentality and information provision were not moderated by this manipulation (Supplementary Table 7). Thus, our data provide stable evidence that communication in favour of building wind turbines increases likelihood of voting for it\u2014especially among those with strong conspiracy mentality.\nA subset of studies (Studies 4\u20136, 8) included an additional experimental condition in which participants received arguments in favour of the wind turbines but also the same number of contra arguments. Here we sought to increase ecological validity because in real-world contexts, people are exposed to pro and contra arguments as part of debate. These studies also spoke to a theoretical controversy. On the basis of the classical Yale model of persuasion, this kind of two-sided communication could be considered particularly trustworthy and effective34, although subsequent research has shown inconsistent results35.\nResults revealed that the effectiveness of pro arguments was significantly reduced when counterarguments were also included, b = \u22123.19, 95% CI [\u22124.21; \u22122.17], t(4,164) = \u22126.13, p < 0.001. Still, receiving both pro and contra arguments slightly increased willingness to vote in favour of wind turbines compared with receiving no communication, b = 1.47, 95% CI [0.45; 2.49], t(4,164) = 2.81, p = 0.005 (Fig. 2). It is reassuring to know that providing pro and contra arguments simultaneously does not make things worse\u2014especially in light of previous research showing that denialists\u2019 rhetoric reduces beliefs in anthropogenic climate change36. Still, these studies demonstrate that stakeholders who want to convince the local population of wind turbines\u2019 merits might have a harder time when facing other stakeholders with competing interests.\nSpecific conspiracy beliefs\nResults reported so far are based on a measure of conspiracy mentality; that is, the general propensity to believe in conspiracy theories. As outlined above, this needs to be distinguished from believing a specific conspiracy theory within a given context15; in this case, conspiracies surrounding the referendum that participants were evaluating. To examine specific conspiracy beliefs, we included six items (for example, \u2018The municipality withholds important information that would speak against the construction of the wind turbines\u2019; \u2018The municipality has made secret arrangements with the executing energy company so that both would profit financially from the construction of the wind turbines\u2019). These beliefs were relatively widespread in the nationally quota-balanced sample; 26% of participants scored above the scale midpoint (M = 3.23, SD = 1.39; Fig. 3).\nThese conspiracy beliefs were even more strongly associated with lower support for wind turbines than conspiracy mentality (again controlling for demographic variables and political orientation), b = \u221211.51, 95% CI [\u221212.33; \u221210.69], t(2,106) = \u221227.45, p < 0.001, r = \u22120.51 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Support for wind turbines was by approximately 16 percentage points lower with each 1 SD increase in specific conspiracy beliefs. When adding specific conspiracy beliefs and conspiracy mentality simultaneously to the regression, conspiracy mentality predicted substantially less variance, b = \u22121.25, 95% CI [\u22122.32; \u22120.17], t(2,105) = \u22122.28, p = 0.023, than the specific belief, b = \u221210.83, 95% CI [\u221211.84; \u22129.82], t(2,105) = \u221221.01, p < 0.001. This supports the idea that specific conspiracy beliefs are manifestations of conspiracy mentality in concrete contexts15.\nProviding arguments in favour of building the wind turbines still enhanced support among those strongly endorsing specific conspiracy beliefs, b = 2.86, 95% CI [1.95; 3.76], t(3,747) = p < 0.001, but only about half of the extent to which it did for those with a strong conspiracy mentality. However, in the studies for which positive information was balanced with negative information, there was no reliable improvement in voting intentions among those with strong specific conspiracy beliefs, b = 0.54, 95% CI [\u22120.42; 1.50], t(3,747) = 1.10, p = 0.270. Although there was no evidence that information provision caused backfire effects among those high in conspiracy beliefs, it is sobering that the positive effects of supportive evidence could be neutralized by counterarguments.\nDiscussion\nA rapid increase in the number of wind farms is needed to reduce carbon emissions worldwide and to slow climate change. The current research revealed a factor that could be a major barrier to achieving this goal: conspiracy beliefs. We showed that the stronger people\u2019s conspiracy mentality, the less likely they were to vote for the construction of wind turbines close to their community in a potential referendum. It is revealing to examine the relative strength in predictive value of conspiracy mentality compared with other variables (percentage of variance explained in voting intentions can be calculated by squaring the correlations). Conspiracy mentality explained five times more variance compared with political orientation and around 20 times more variance than age, gender, education and state in the nationally quota-balanced sample.\nNotably, over a quarter of this sample scored high on endorsement of specific conspiracy theories about the wind farm construction. When considering participants\u2019 beliefs in these specific conspiracy theories, the relationship was even stronger, explaining at least 25 times more variance in voting intentions compared with the other variables. These findings suggest that a predisposition to believe conspiracy theories is a barrier to wind farm acceptance and even more so when this general predisposition crystallizes into believing specific conspiracy theories about the authorities\u2019 motives.\nLongitudinal research provided evidence for the causal effects of conspiracy beliefs on vaccination and countermeasures during the COVID-19 pandemic37,38,39. It therefore also seems reasonable to assume a similar causal pathway here: that participants start with a general conspiracy mentality, which takes shape in the form of specific conspiracy beliefs, which then directly affect voting intentions15 (but see ref. 40). However, our studies are not designed to test this causal claim. Longitudinal studies may be useful going forward in terms of shoring up the case for a causal relationship between conspiracy beliefs and wind farm resistance.\nOur studies also investigated potential methods of intervention and offered good news: people can be reached via public communication that stresses the benefits of wind farms. Overall, and particularly among those holding a strong conspiracy mentality, willingness to vote for the construction of wind turbines could be enhanced by providing pro arguments (for example, potential to reduce emissions). This communication was still effective (but to a lesser degree) among people who strongly believed in specific conspiracy theories around the wind turbines. This adds substance to the limited body of research investigating public communication about wind energy projects3,32. It shows that providing arguments early on (ideally before specific conspiracy beliefs evolve) is important to increase wind farm acceptance and to counter the negative phenomena associated with conspiracy mentality. Drawing on research on conspiracy mentality and vaccination, such communication might be even more effective when it comes from people\u2019s close social environment (compared with authorities)41 as peer influence also shapes energy-related behaviours42. The positive effect of information provision is reassuring given discussion in other literature that in polarized environments, information about science can cause backfire effects43,44 and in the context of a general scepticism in the scholarly community that conspiracy theorists can be \u2018reached\u2019 through information provision alone45,46.\nHowever, some of the reported studies examined effects of information provision under more realistic conditions, that is, when people had access to both arguments in favour of and against building the wind turbines. These results gave less reason for optimism. On one hand, balanced communication was still somewhat effective among those with a strong conspiracy mentality. On the other hand, it remained ineffective among those who strongly believed in a specific conspiracy theory around the referendum. One way of reaching these people might be prevention rather than intervention.\nPreventive approaches against conspiracy beliefs and their negative correlates have already been tested in the literature. Most prominently, inoculation or pre-bunking strategies are effective in reducing people\u2019s susceptibility to misinformation and conspiracy theories46,47,48. That is, providing people with a weak dose of false information up front, or making them aware of the strategies that are used by conspiracy theorists, can prepare them to resist misinformation. Likewise, providing detailed explanations about an issue before conspiracy theories spread can increase people\u2019s resistance against these narratives49,50. Such strategies could be applied in the domain of wind farm acceptance as well.\nEmbedded in the German context, the current research focused on a single country in which wind energy already plays a major role. But given their pledge to reach net-zero emissions, other countries will probably be in a similar position of increasing wind energy in the future. Investigating the role of conspiracy mentality in shaping citizens\u2019 support for wind farms in a country on the forefront of implementing this technology provides valuable insights for other countries on steep decarbonization trajectories.\nMethods\nParticipants and study design\nWe pre-registered all studies on aspredicted.org (Study 1: https://aspredicted.org/46at3.pdf; Study 2: https://aspredicted.org/rn59j.pdf; Study 3: https://aspredicted.org/z3by8.pdf; Study 4: https://aspredicted.org/pg5st.pdf; Study 5: https://aspredicted.org/gt893.pdf; Study 6: https://aspredicted.org/vv9wi.pdf; Study 7: https://aspredicted.org/mq4ut.pdf; Study 8: https://aspredicted.org/m295a.pdf).\nIn total, N = 4,170 participants took part in our studies (Study 1: n = 142; Study 2: n = 275; Study 3: n = 361; Study 4: n = 416; Study 5: n = 419; Study 6: n = 249; Study 7: n = 193; Study 8: n = 2,115). Three hundred and one additional participants were excluded based on pre-registered criteria (below). The sample sizes of all single studies were determined to be able to detect at least a small effect (f\u00b2 = 0.05) in a multiple regression analysis with a statistical power of 80% at a significance level of 5%. Demographic data of the participants are presented in the Supplementary Table 1. All studies were conducted online with German adults who were recruited via participant platforms (Clickworker: Studies 1, 2, 3 and 7; Prolific: Studies 5 and 6). Study 8 was run by a recruiting agency (Respondi) to collect a nationally quota-balanced sample (in terms of age, gender, education and state). Payment of participants differed between studies due to different survey lengths but was generally above the statutory minimum wage in the country (except Study 8 for which the recruiting agency determined the payment).\nAs noted in our pre-registrations, we included participants in our analyses if they fulfilled the following criteria: were at least 18 years old, spoke German fluently (because study materials were largely text based), did not fail the attention check items included in the survey, did not take the survey multiple times, were not psychology students (because they are familiar with psychological study procedures and might be suspicious about our hypotheses) and were not identified as statistical outliers in the main analysis (based on studentized deleted residuals, see pre-registrations). In Study 8, however, we did not apply the language and psychology criteria (as pre-registered) to not compromise the representativeness of the sample. For the same reason, we did not analyse the data of 75 participants in Study 8 who were additionally recruited due to a sampling error of the recruiting agency. On the basis of these criteria N = 301 participants from the original samples were excluded (Study 1: n = 10; Study 2: n = 24; Study 3: n = 36; Study 4: n = 34; Study 5: n = 28; Study 6: n = 22; Study 7: n = 4; Study 8: n = 143). The applied exclusions did not change the results in a way that would lead to different conclusions than the ones we presented in the main text.\nProcedure and measures\nThe experiments were implemented via the Qualtrics survey software. The procedure and measures were nearly identical across all studies. Slight differences across studies were due to the specific research questions addressed in each study. After giving informed consent at the outset of the studies, participants were asked to imagine that there were plans to build five wind turbines close to their communities and that there was a referendum to decide on these plans. Participants were aware that the referendum and the wind farms were fictitious.\nThen, participants were randomly assigned to different experimental conditions. Two of these conditions were identical in all studies: the only pro condition and the no communication condition. In the only pro condition, participants were told that the municipality published a leaflet to inform citizens about the planned wind turbines and that the information was based on independent experts\u2019 reviews. The leaflet contained seven arguments in favour of building the wind turbines (Supplementary Methods for details). Participants in the no communication condition did not receive such a leaflet but directly proceeded with the survey. Besides these two basic experimental conditions, several studies contained additional experimental conditions (Supplementary Table 2 for an overview). In Study 2, we added a condition in which the leaflet (containing only pro arguments) ostensibly stemmed from the operating energy company (instead of the municipality) to manipulate vested interests (Supplementary Table 8 for manipulation check results). Studies 4 and 5 contained an additional experimental condition in which participants received an equal number of arguments opposed to building the wind turbines in alternation with the pro arguments. These counterarguments were said to be raised by a local initiative opposing the wind turbines. In Studies 6 and 8, we presented the same balanced arguments, but here they were presented by the same source (that is, the municipality bringing up both sides but eventually refuting the counterarguments). We refer to these latter two conditions as balanced conditions.\nAfterwards, participants were asked to indicate their voting intentions as our main dependent variable. The concrete wording of the referendum was \u2018Are you in favour of the municipality leasing land for the purpose of constructing and operating five wind turbines?\u2019. Participants\u2019 response options ranged from \u2018I would definitely vote no\u2019 (0%) to \u2018I would definitely vote yes\u2019 (100%). In Study 3, we added two experimental conditions (one presenting only pro and one presenting no communication) in which the framing of the referendum was reversed; that is, asking whether participants were against (instead of in favour of) constructing the wind turbines. In all studies, we included further measures for exploratory reasons (Supplementary Table 3 for a complete list of measures). In Studies 3\u20138, we measured belief in specific conspiracy theories about the referendum with a six-item scale. Conspiracy mentality was always assessed at the end of the survey with a 12-item scale12. Both measures were not substantially affected by the preceding experimental manipulation (conspiracy mentality: effect size eta-squared (\u03b7\u00b2) = 0.002; specific conspiracy beliefs: \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.01). Thus, we were successful in our aim to not activate conspiracy theories with our manipulation. Demographic information including age, gender and education was then retrieved before debriefing participants about the purpose of the study.\nAnalysis strategy\nTo analyse the relationship between conspiracy mentality (or specific conspiracy beliefs) and the acceptance of wind turbines in the nationally quota-balanced sample (that is, Study 8), we conducted linear multiple regression analysis. Conspiracy mentality was included as predictor and age, gender (+1 female, \u22121 male), education (1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high), political orientation (from 1 \u2018left\u2019 to 7 \u2018right\u2019) and state. We sorted the 16 German federal states according to their installed onshore wind power capacity divided by the size of the state. Then, we split the states into two groups representing the lower (\u22121) and the upper half (+1) in terms of installed capacity per km\u00b2 resulting in comparable numbers of participants (Supplementary Table 4 for the rank order of the states). To be able to include gender as a covariate in these analyses, we removed the two participants who reported their gender as \u2018other\u2019.\nTo examine the impact of the pro arguments versus balanced arguments, we report merged analyses across all studies in the main text (that is, we combined the data of all studies into one large dataset). This was possible because all studies shared the crucial properties of the experimental design and used the same procedure and measures. Such an aggregated way of analysing the data has the advantage of maximizing statistical power to detect the true effect of interest with smaller confidence intervals51. It also allows for presenting all the data we collected in an efficient and transparent manner (that is, we report all studies that we conducted to test the research questions). The reason for conducting several smaller studies partly lies in the fact that the first results were counter to our theory-driven expectations (pre-registrations), which led us to replicate them in subsequent studies and to test several plausible moderators (as outlined in the main text). The final study served to confirm these results with a large and nationally quota-balanced sample.\nThe merged analyses followed the pre-registration of Study 8 and contained three experimental conditions (communication: only pro versus balanced versus no communication). In a first linear multiple regression analysis, we tested the impact of the only pro (versus no communication) condition on willingness to vote for the construction of the wind turbines. To this end, and following the recommendations of Aiken and West52, we used orthogonal contrasts to code the experimental conditions (focal contrast: +1 only pro, 0 balanced, \u22121 no communication; residual contrast: \u22121 only pro, +2 balanced, \u22121 no communication) and mean-centred the continuous predictor conspiracy mentality. In addition, the interaction terms of both contrasts and mean-centred conspiracy mentality were included as predictors. Following the same principal procedure, we conducted two more linear multiple regression analyses to examine the effectiveness of the balanced communication. These two regression analyses used different contrasts to compare the balanced with the only pro condition (focal contrast: \u22121 only pro, +1 balanced, 0 no communication; residual contrast: +1 only pro, +1 balanced, \u22122 no communication) and the balanced with the no communication condition (focal contrast: 0 only pro, +1 balanced, \u22121 no communication; residual contrast: +2 only pro, \u22121 balanced, \u22121 no communication). All statistical tests were two sided. Analyses with specific conspiracy beliefs as predictor were carried out analogously. Complete results of these regression analyses and the pre-registered analyses for all individual studies can be found in the Supplementary Notes. All analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS v25.

      "text": "We have grown so used to many things. To the pictures of wildfires and cremated animals, to the ice sheets calving into the ocean, to the promises of world leaders that they will heed the \u201clast chance\u201d warning of the scientists.\nIt\u2019s hard for anyone under the age of 40 to remember a time when carbon dioxide build-up, whether it was \u201cthe greenhouse effect\u201d, or \u201cglobal warming\u201d or \u201cclimate change\u201d or now \u201cclimate crisis\u201d, wasn\u2019t in the news.\nThe long hot summer of 1988 \u2013 35 years ago \u2013 is held as the moment that world leaders began to mouth the right pieties.\nPresidential candidate (and soon to be president) George H.W. Bush said he would use the \u201cWhite House effect\u201d to fix the Greenhouse Effect (he didn\u2019t). UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher warned of a giant experiment being conducted \u201cwith the system of this planet itself\u201d.\nThirty-five years. But it was actually 35 years before that \u2013 fully 70 years ago this month \u2013 that the danger of carbon dioxide build-up in the atmosphere first travelled around the world.\nThat carbon dioxide trapped heat was uncontroversial. Irish scientist John Tyndall (possibly drawing on the work of an American, Eunice Foote) had shown that it did back in the mid-1800s.\nIn 1895, Swedish Nobel prize winner Svante Arrhenius had suggested that \u2013 over hundreds of years \u2013 the build-up of carbon dioxide released when humans burn oil, coal and gas might trap so much heat as to melt the tundra and make freezing winters a thing of the past.\nHis work was challenged, but the idea occasionally popped up in popular journals. In 1938 English steam engineer Guy Callendar suggested to the Royal Meteorological Society in London that warming was underway.\nBut it was in early May, 1953, at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union, that Canadian physicist Gilbert Plass \u2013 who had been corresponding with Callendar \u2013 told the gathered scientists that trouble was afoot.\nPlass said that:\nThe large increase in industrial activity during the present century is discharging so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that the average temperature is rising at the rate of 1.5 degrees per century.\nThis got picked up by the Associated Press and other wire services and appeared in newspapers all around the world (even as far afield as the Sydney Morning Herald). Plass\u2019s warning also popped up in Newsweek on May 18 and in Time on May 25.\nThe fact that the world was warming was already uncontroversial among scientists. But the emphatic connection with carbon dioxide made by Plass, as opposed to competing theories such as orbital wobbles or sunspot activity, was newsworthy.\nPlass had become interested in the question of carbon dioxide buildup while working for the Ford Motor Company. He looked at how carbon dioxide actually functions in the real world, not just at sea level (without getting too technical. Many scientists had dismissed Arrhenius\u2019s earlier work on the basis of false confidence that carbon dioxide worked the same there as in the stratosphere).\nPlass kept working on the issue, with technical and popular publications through the rest of the 1950s. In 1956, he had an academic article on \u201cthe carbon dioxide theory of climate change\u201d published in the Swedish scientific journal Tellus, and also a popular article in the American Scientist. And he was present at the first major meetings to discuss carbon dioxide build up.\nMeanwhile, the carbon dioxide theory started getting more coverage among science journalists. One, George Wendt, wrote up the findings in the then well-regarded UNESCO Courier, and this got excerpted in the Irish Times in 1954, the same year that British journalists started mentioning it.\nIn 1957 the then-new magazine New Scientist mentioned it. By the end of the 1950s, anyone who read a newspaper could have been aware of the basic idea.\nThroughout the 50s and 60s US, Swedish, German and Soviet scientists were examining the issue. In 1965 President Lyndon Johnson even namechecked carbon dioxide build-up in an address to Congress.\nBy the end of the 1960s international collaboration was beginning, though there was caution still. For instance, in April 1969 the American scientist Charles Keeling, who had been measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at a Hawaiian observatory, revealed that he had been asked to change the title of a lecture from, \u201cIf carbon dioxide from fossil fuels is changing man\u2019s environment, what will we do about it?\u201d to \u201cIs carbon dioxide from fossil fuel changing man\u2019s environment?\u201d\nFor climate historians like me, the 1970s are a fascinating period of intense measurement, modelling, observation and thinking which, by the end of the decade, produced a working consensus that there was serious trouble ahead. In effect, Plass had nailed it.\nWhen Plass spoke out, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide was at about 310 parts per million. Today, they\u2019re 423 or so. Every year, as we burn more oil, coal and gas, the concentration climbs and more heat is trapped.\nBy the time Plass\u2019s warning is 100 years old, the concentrations will be much higher. There\u2019s a very good chance we will have gone over the 2\u00b0C warming level that used to be regarded as \u201csafe\u201d.\nDon\u2019t have time to read about climate change as much as you\u2019d like?\nGet a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.

This essay goes beyond these considerations to explore the often-unarticulated explanations for animosity toward this energy technology. Originally, it posits that opposition to visually obvious turbines arises from the successful history of an electric utility system that made its product largely invisible in its manufacture and physical manifestation. The existence of conspicuous turbines, however, reminds observers that power generation requires difficult choices in a technology-based society. The system\u2019s previous achievement in hiding infrastructural elements, in other words, sometimes works ironically to spur objections to wind turbines. Receiving little historical study, the concealed features of a system\u2019s infrastructure often influence assessments of technologies. By revealing the previously invisible, this essay, which draws on research in history, landscape architecture, geography, and psychology, therefore provides insights for social scientists and policymakers."

      "text": "Abstract\nDespite their alignment with sustainable development principles, wind farms often provoke controversy and misinformation, particularly regarding the noise they produce and their potential impact on human functioning. Concerns have been raised about the possible effects of this noise on irritation levels, psychological well-being, and cognitive functioning. Yet, there is still a lack of controlled, comprehensive studies that could substantiate these concerns. Here, a cognitive neuroscience approach is proposed to experimentally and multifactorial explore wind turbine noise\u2019s impact on various mental functions. We used recordings from an actual wind turbine to investigate its effects on the dynamics of brain waves crucial for complex cognitive tasks, as well as on sustained attention and inductive reasoning in healthy adult volunteers. We also tested the subjective evaluation of the stress induced by wind turbine noise and the annoyance it causes. Control conditions included silence and road traffic noise (participants were blind to the nature of acoustic variables). The findings of this pilot study reveal that short-term exposure to wind turbine noise with a sound pressure level corresponding to the real-world situation (i.e., 65 dB SPL) does not adversely affect any of the examined cognitive functions and is not perceived as more stressful or bothersome than road traffic noise. Furthermore, we utilized various psychological scales and found that even tendencies towards rumination or reduced capacity for reflection and ambiguity tolerance did not lead to maladaptive perceptions of wind turbine noise and, therefore, to a state that might indirectly influence mental functioning. Although these results cannot be generalized, they support the concept that the interlinkage between exposure to wind turbine noise and human cognitive functioning is not a cause-and-effect relationship. We discuss the mediating role of socially constructed beliefs about wind farms in this interrelation. We also indicate how important the use of a cognitive neuroscience approach in future research may be for an objective assessment of the impact of wind farms on human cognition.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nNoise, a pervasive environmental stressor, has been demonstrated to adversely affect human functioning, encompassing physiological and psychological processes, as well as the neuronal mechanisms underpinning behavior and the execution of cognitive tasks. Consequently, noise has emerged as a significant public health concern worldwide, with its influence on human functioning, particularly mental functioning, becoming a focal point of rigorous scientific investigation (Jafari et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2024). A synthesis of these studies reveals that individuals exposed to elevated noise levels undergo adverse psychophysiological changes (primarily felt as an increase in annoyance), often culminating in disturbances in cognitive functioning. These disturbances may manifest as diminished effectiveness in performing tasks requiring concentrated attention, storing information in working memory, or problem-solving within the reasoning process (Astuti et al., 2023; Muller et al., 2023; Pieper et al., 2021). In other words, such mechanisms as subjective noise annoyance assessment controls, in a way, the impact of noise on mental processes. A prevalent source of noise capable of influencing cognitive abilities in this manner is, for example, the noise generated by air conditioners. Research indicates that impulsive sounds produced by air conditioners can elicit physiological responses, subsequently impacting cognition (Soeta and Onogawa, 2023). In recent years, novel noise sources have emerged, and their impact on diverse cognitive functions remains largely uncharted. Nonetheless, systematic research suggests that certain new noises can be highly disruptive. An example of this is the noise generated by drones, which research suggests is considerably more annoying than other typical environmental noise sources and is poorly masked by ambient noise (Alkmim et al., 2022; Schaffer et al., 2021; Torija and Nicholls, 2022).\nIn the context of some new noises, various misleading or fake information have surfaced, insinuating that such noises may possess a certain uniqueness that impairs cognition. A case in point is the noise from wind turbines. Despite the development of wind farms being a pivotal element of the global energy transformation and numerous countries investing in this technology to increase the share of renewable energy sources in their energy mix and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the social perception of wind farms is markedly diverse (Davy et al., 2020; Hanning and Evans, 2012). They are often negatively evaluated, for instance, as overly intrusive in the landscape, insufficiently contributing to the development of the local community residing near the farm, and as a source of noise that is purported to affect life detrimentally, including impairing cognitive functioning, particularly concentration efficiency (Hansen and Hansen, 2020; Lundheim et al., 2022; Takeuchi, 2023). This phenomenon has been informally termed wind turbine syndrome (Pierpont, 2009), yet its actual etiology has never been described. As a result, conspiracy slogans or internet posts are often disseminated suggesting that, for example, wind turbine noise could limit learning effectiveness in nearby schools or constrain mental processes conducted in local homes or workplaces. Since there are no controlled and comprehensive studies on these issues (Clark and Paunovic, 2018; van Kamp and van den Berg, 2021; cf. Pleban et al., 2024), the degree to which these claims reflect reality remains a matter for further investigation (Marshall et al., 2023).\nPrior studies into the influence of wind turbine noise on the comprehensive spectrum of human functionality have yielded diverse outcomes, some of which remain equivocal, contributing to a non-comprehensive or inconsistent body of evidence. This is particularly relevant to health issues, where numerous investigations have examined the impact of wind turbine noise on various aspects of health-related quality of life (Shepherd et al., 2011), such as cardiovascular functioning or sleep efficiency (Ageborg Morsing et al., 2018; Michaud et al., 2025; Smith et al., 2020). The only relatively consistent research results pertain to the increase in annoyance levels among people living near wind farms and the generally high annoyance ratings attributed to wind turbine noise (Ramalho et al., 2025; van Kamp and van den Berg, 2021). For instance, for equivalent day-evening-night noise levels, wind turbine noise is rated as the most annoying, followed by aircraft noise, then road noise, with railroad noise being the least annoying (Janssen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is often posited that annoyance (which has negative consequences for cognitive functioning) is the sole health risk factor associated with wind turbine noise (Radun et al., 2022). Nonetheless, the reasons for this increase in annoyance remain unclear.\nOne of the common hypothetical explanations of annoyance caused by wind turbine noise may be related to acoustic characteristics. This noise differs from other environmental noises (e.g., traffic, trains, air traffic), particularly in terms of sound level changes over time and spectral structure. A distinguishing feature of wind turbine noise is the periodicity of level changes, known as amplitude modulation. The noise level of a wind turbine periodically decreases and increases within a range of about 4 dB. This change occurs at an average frequency of about 0.5 Hz to 2 Hz, although it can sometimes reach up to 4 Hz (Ioannidou et al., 2016). It is argued that the amplitude modulation of wind turbine noise is the most significant factor determining the detection of this sound against other noises and the effect on the degree of annoyance (Hafke-Dys et al., 2016). The greater the change in sound level over time (modulation depth), the greater the annoyance caused by wind turbine noise. In terms of spectral structure, when comparing the sound spectra of road traffic noise and wind turbine noise expressed in dB SPL, in both cases, there is a large proportion of acoustic energy in the low-frequency range (<200 Hz) (see Fig. 2a in \u201cMethods\u201d). However, despite the high sound pressure levels in the low-frequency range, especially in the infrasound range (up to 20 Hz), this band does not play a significant role in the perception of wind turbine and road traffic noise sounds (van Kamp and van den Berg, 2021; Yokoyama et al., 2014). On the other hand, when analyzing the spectra of wind turbine and road noise, taking into account the correction curve A (dBA), it can be seen that for road traffic noise, the energy maximum clearly falls in the 1 kHz frequency band (Okada et al., 2020). In contrast, a clear maximum does not occur for wind turbine noise, but the band\u2019s energy from 400 to about 1600 Hz is dominant (Fig. 2a). The amplitude modulation is likely the largest contributor to the annoyance rating of wind turbine noise, the occurrence of which causes an unmasking effect compared to other types of environmental noise (Hafke-Dys et al., 2016).\nHowever, a growing body of literature suggests that the assessed annoyance is less strongly linked to the acoustic characteristics of wind turbine noise than previously believed. This has led to the formulation of an alternative hypothesis, proposing that the source of annoyance is rooted in non-acoustic variables (McCunney et al., 2014; Schmidt and Klokker, 2014), or, as a very recent questionnaire-based study suggests (Ata Teneler and Hassoy, 2024), in the interaction of acoustic factors with non-acoustic variables. These variables may be associated with visual phenomena, such as the visibility of wind turbines or shadow flicker (Hubner et al., 2019; Knopper and Ollson, 2011; Szychowska et al., 2018; van Kamp and van den Berg, 2021; Voicescu et al., 2016), but primarily with socially constructed attitudes and expectations or certain psychological conditions (Miedema and Vos, 2003; Pohl et al., 2018; Schaffer et al., 2016). As shown by the latest systematic review (Obuseh et al., 2025), social contexts, such as misinformation about the impact of wind turbines on human functioning, may play a major role here. It is also postulated that potential adverse physical and mental responses emerge solely among individuals with a negatively oriented personality, exhibiting, for instance, high levels of neuroticism, negative affect, and intolerance to frustration (Taylor et al., 2013). The importance of such personality characteristics for wind turbine noise perception was demonstrated in a rapid evidence review covering 2020\u20132024 (Woodland et al., 2024). Moreover, a systematic literature review including publications from 1998\u20132022 (Ramalho et al., 2025) shows no empirical evidence proving a cause-and-effect relationship between wind turbine noise and health, suggesting the presence of moderating social and psychological factors. Thus, within the framework of this hypothesis, it is conjectured that wind turbine noise does not exert a genuine (direct) negative impact on human functioning in a broad sense (Michaud et al., 2016). This could be, in essence, a nocebo effect, where the dissemination of inaccurate information through social conversations and media reports can build artificial adverse symptoms, especially in psychologically sensitive people (Clark et al., 2020; Crichton and Petrie, 2015; Schaffer et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2020). However, recent discussions (e.g., Michaud et al., 2025; Woodland et al., 2024) have noted that due to the non-interventional and opinion-based nature of most studies to date, as well as inconsistent and poor-quality evidence, it is impossible to conclude whether the impact of wind turbine noise on physical-mental health is objective or merely a socio-culturally constructed stressor.\nIn light of the literature reviewed above, and bearing in mind the importance of renewable energy and the development of wind farms (Brouwer et al., 2025; le Maitre et al., 2024; Martinez and Iglesias, 2024), it seems that a new approach is needed in research on the impact of wind turbine noise on human functioning (Michaud et al., 2025; Rabbani et al., 2025). Such an approach should allow for a more objective and comprehensive assessment of this impact. It may limit the role of misinformation in decision-making or opinion-forming and increase the share of evidence in discussions among stakeholder groups, such as residents, policymakers, and energy developers (Brouwer et al., 2025; Tsionas et al., 2025). Against this background, this work proposes a novel approach to explore the impact of wind turbine noise on various mental functions by applying cognitive neuroscience techniques and tenets that current traditional approaches have missed (Boone and Piccinini, 2016; Ilardi and Feldman, 2001). Apart from describing the assumptions of such a unique approach, we attempted to apply it in a pilot study with three research questions. The first question is whether exposure to wind turbine noise significantly changes mental functioning when tested by recording brain activity and objective measurements of cognitive processes. The second question explores whether wind turbine noise is perceived as bothersome and stressful when highly ecologically valid conditions and blinding procedures are used. The last question is whether noise-induced annoyance levels are proportional to the participants\u2019 personality traits measured by valid psychological tools. Based on the results, we scrutinize the interlinkage between exposure to wind turbine noise and human cognitive functioning. We also discuss how to further develop a proposed cognitive neuroscience approach to advance research on the wind industry\u2019s impact on human cognition.\nMethods\nApproach and hypotheses\nThe proposed approach includes several minimum criteria for the research procedure. These guidelines are derived from methodological assumptions in the interdisciplinary field of cognitive neuroscience and the literature review on the psychophysical consequences of exposure to wind turbine noise. Firstly, the study should be highly controlled and allow for manipulation of the independent variable (noise exposure). Therefore, it should take the form of laboratory-based experiments. Additionally, such an experiment should explore both behavioral effects (using recognized and standardized psychological methods) and directly record responses from the nervous system, e.g., through electroencephalography or other brain activity imaging techniques (Basner et al., 2014). Secondly, such a study must also demonstrate high ecological validity (Klichowski and Kroliczak, 2020), i.e., resemble real-world scenarios of wind turbine noise exposure (Alamir et al., 2019). Using a somewhat artificial model, i.e., laboratory-based experiments, this would be evident in the use of actual recordings of wind turbine noise at volumes characteristic of natural situations as acoustic stimuli, unlike the majority of past research where synthetic sounds were used (Maijala et al., 2021). Simultaneously, the recordings must be clean in that they are not contaminated by other noises, such as sounds from a nearby highway, which often occurred in previous studies (McKenna et al., 2025). Furthermore, ecological validity should be ensured by measuring cognitive components associated with everyday mental tasks (e.g., fluid intelligence, problem-solving) rather than tasks abstracted from daily life (Malecki et al., 2023). Thirdly, it is crucial to consider the psychological conditions (characteristics) that render wind turbine noise more bothersome and stressful using standardized psychological tests. The study should also be organized so that the examinee is unaware of the nature of the sound (i.e., blinding) and non-focused listening is employed (Alamir et al., 2019; Szychowska et al., 2018; Turi et al., 2019). Finally, it is imperative to confirm that all participants exhibit standard auditory perception across an extensive frequency spectrum, noting that traditional audiological examinations rarely assess hearing sensitivity below 250 Hz, thereby overlooking a significant frequency domain when evaluating the impact of wind turbine noise (Alamir et al., 2019; Yonemura and Sakamoto, 2025).\nHere, we conducted a pilot study for such a complex cognitive neuroscience experiment. Employing a baseline-intervention design and recordings from an actual wind turbine (with the sound pressure levels corresponding to the real situation in which a person residing at a distance of several hundred meters from sources), we compared how the dynamics of brain waves crucial for complex cognitive tasks and the effectiveness of sustained attention and inductive reasoning change under short-term exposure to wind turbine noise. Note that sustained attention plays a crucial role in everyday learning and working, and that in everyday life most reasoning is inductive (Cowley, 2018; Hayes and Heit, 2017). We also examined the level of such changes when exposed to road traffic noise and in the absence of any noise. Additionally, we tested the subjective evaluation of noise-induced annoyance and stress while controlling the participants\u2019 hearing. We correlated these results with the diagnosed levels of such psychological characteristics in the participants as ambiguity tolerance, rumination, and reflection, i.e., variables moderating the adaptation process (or lack thereof) to new, atypical conditions (Thalbourne and Houran, 2000; Thomsen et al., 2013). Importantly, we only revealed the nature of sounds during debriefing. Thus, participants did not know what they heard, i.e., the procedure was blind.\nWe defined three hypotheses to predict the potential answers to the three research questions mentioned in the introduction: (i) The exposure to wind turbine and road traffic noise would elicit significant changes in cognitive functioning, both at behavioral and neuronal levels, compared to a control group operating in silence. Specifically, the noise-exposed groups would deteriorate in cognitive performance, while the control group might exhibit stability or even improvement. Hypothesis 1 thus refers to the theoretical assumption described earlier that individuals exposed to noise undergo adverse psychophysiological changes (primarily felt as an increase in annoyance), often culminating in diminished effectiveness in performing tasks requiring concentrated attention or problem-solving within the reasoning process (Astuti et al., 2023; Muller et al., 2023; Pieper et al., 2021). (ii) Wind turbine noise would be perceived as more bothersome and stressful than road traffic noise, thereby inducing more pronounced negative changes. Hypothesis 2 is based on research findings indicating the generally high annoyance ratings attributed to wind turbine noise (Ramalho et al., 2025; Radun et al., 2022; van Kamp and van den Berg, 2021), and that for equivalent noise levels, wind turbine noise is rated as more annoying than road noise (Janssen et al., 2011). (iii) The perceived annoyance and stress from wind turbine noise would be inversely proportional to the participant\u2019s tolerance for ambiguity and reflectiveness and directly proportional to their tendency for rumination. In other words, individuals with less adaptive strategies for perceiving new situations and a higher propensity for neurotic self-focused thoughts would be expected to find wind turbine noise more annoying and stressful. Hypothesis 3 thus relates to the concept that non-acoustic variables, such as psychological traits stimulating negative responses to unusual stimuli, like intolerance to frustration or epistemic self-focused thoughts, cause maladaptive perceptions of wind turbine noise (Obuseh et al., 2025; Pohl et al., 2018; Schaffer et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2013; Woodland et al., 2024).\nParticipants\nIn order to determine the minimum sample size necessary for this pilot study, an a priori power analysis was conducted for a mixed-model 2 \u00d7 3 ANOVA. This analysis included the within-subject factor of time (comprising the baseline/initial phase of the study and the intervention/second phase) and the between-subject factor of the group (encompassing wind turbine noise, road traffic noise, and silence). The investigation was performed using G*Power for Mac (Version 3.1.9.6). The results indicated that a total of 42 participants are needed to demonstrate a medium effect size (f) of 0.25, with a Type I error (\u03b1) of 0.05 and a Type II error (\u03b2) of 0.20 (1\u2013\u03b2/power = 0.80), and, therefore, to achieve the power of 80%, typically sought in behavioral sciences (Cohen, 1988; Tomczak et al., 2014). Consequently, 45 volunteers were recruited.\nAs is typical for basic laboratory cognitive neuroscience experiments (particularly those beginning a broader research program or a cycle of full-scale studies), the participants were healthy university students (30 females, 15 males, recruited via university website, email, and snowball sampling), aged between 18 and 25 years (mean=22.47, SD = 1.63). Thus, they were mature individuals who were not yet subject to aging processes and had a lengthy educational background. It is important to note that a previous study (Miedema and Vos, 1999) indicated that age is a factor that modifies the evaluation of noise annoyance. However, there is no linear relationship; instead, it has a curvilinear shape, meaning that relatively young (<20) and relatively old (>60) individuals report less annoyance than people between 20 and 60 years old. Moreover, a recent literature review (Ni and Huang, 2022) showed that noise-induced annoyance increases with age, peaking at around 18 years and then declining until approximately 30 years, after which it stabilizes, albeit with a continued gradual decline. Consequently, the participants in our study belong to the age group that is typically the most sensitive to noise compared to other age groups. Regarding education, individuals with higher education levels feel relatively more annoyed. Therefore, our group should be characterized by a sensitivity to noise annoyance (although we had a few people just starting their university studies). As such, similar exposure to wind turbine noise as in our experiment would not cause higher annoyance in younger or older individuals and those with lower education levels. In other studies on the impact of noise on human functioning, an analogous selection of the research sample was used, both in the decision on the size and in the recruitment of volunteers from the university student population (for a recent example, see Yonemura and Sakamoto, 2025 and Zhang et al., 2024).\nEligibility was determined using a brief questionnaire to ensure that they met the inclusion criteria (e.g., being of legal age, having university student status) and did not meet any of the exclusion criteria (e.g., having severe head injuries or undergone ear surgery, experiencing dizziness or tinnitus). All participants reported having normal or corrected-to-normal vision abilities and no history of neurological disorders or severe head injuries. Additionally, they declared not to use any medication that could affect the functioning of the nervous system, not to have used psychoactive substances within 24 h prior to the experiment, and not to have consumed caffeine on the day of the examination. Furthermore, all individuals have self-declared normal hearing abilities, which were corroborated by three auditory assessments: audiometry, otoacoustic emissions, and tympanometry. Audiometric measurements of participants\u2019 hearing thresholds were performed for frequencies in the 0.125\u20138 kHz range using an AC40 Interacoustics audiometer. The measurement frequencies were 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 kHz. The study participants\u2019 mean hearing thresholds in the 0.125\u20138 kHz frequency range were 3 dB HL and did not exceed 25 dB HL for each frequency. The measured SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) values of DP (distortion product) otoacoustic emission were 21 dB SPL. Tympanometry results showed Type A tympanograms in all participants. Before the study, participants were assured of anonymity and provided written informed consent. All 45 volunteers completed the study.\nProcedure\nBefore the experiment commenced, all volunteers were required to complete a digital questionnaire at home, which included a demographic survey, the Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale, and the Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire. Then, irrespective of their responses, they were randomly allocated to one of the groups: (1) exposed to the noise of road traffic, (2) subjected to the wind turbines noise, or (3) a group in which participants performed all tasks in silence. We used a gender-balanced approach \u2013 the same number of females (n = 10) and males (n = 5) were in each group. The groups did not differ in mean age (F2,42 = 0.897, p = 0.416). We used a between-groups study design to prevent carryover effects of the preceding sound to the following procedure, which can occur in a within-subjects study design.\nThe laboratory part of the study procedure (implemented in our Cognitive Neuroscience Center) was divided into two nearly identical phases, i.e., baseline/first section of the study and intervention/second section. Each section was initiated with a 10-min task involving reading a text on a tablet. More precisely, participants were asked to sit comfortably in an armchair and provided with a tablet (Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 LTE, SM-T535) displaying a popular science article in their native language. They were instructed to relax and read silently at their own pace until they were informed that the time was up. Subsequently, participants moved to a computer station (located in another laboratory room) where an EEG measurement was conducted, followed by two cognitive ability assessments: the Sustained Attention to Response Task and the Matrix Reasoning Item Bank test. After completing all tasks in the first section, they returned to the first room with an armchair to continue reading the article for another 10 min. Further, based on the assigned condition, they completed the remaining measurements and tasks from the second part of the study either in silence or while exposed to wind turbines or road traffic noise. Afterward, participants from the road traffic and wind turbine noise groups completed two additional pen-and-paper questionnaires related to the subjective assessment of the auditory stimuli used in the study: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and Noise Annoyance Questionnaire. Finally, their hearing was evaluated using audiometry (Interacoustics AC40), otoacoustic emission testing, and tympanometry (Interacoustics Titan) in the psychoacoustic laboratory in our center\u2019s third room. The last element was a debriefing, during which we revealed the nature of sounds to participants from the noise-exposed groups.\nIt must be strongly emphasized that participants were not informed about the purpose of the noise exposure either before or during the experiment. They were only told that there might be some sound during the study. The participants did not know if or when the sound would occur, nor did they know what the sound would be (blinding). After the study, we asked the group exposed to wind turbine noise to name the sound. None identified it as wind turbine noise. Most provided general descriptions indicating it was some noise, and some participants specified that the sound reminded them of a noise generated by ocean waves or an airplane.\nThe research procedure was approved by The Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Educational Studies at Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, on December 12, 2022 (Ethical Approval No. WSE-KEdsPB-03/2022/2023) and adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The overall workflow of our experimental design is visualized in Fig. 1, and all its relevant elements are described in the following subsections.\nTolerance of Ambiguity Scale\nThe Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale is comprised of 12 items, each presented as a statement. Respondents must indicate their level of agreement with each statement on a scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree). The instrument presupposes a unifactorial structure for ambiguity tolerance. Hence, the scoring is conducted by summing the points assigned to individual responses (note that seven items are reverse scored). A higher overall score on the scale (ranging from a minimum of 12 to a maximum of 84) indicates a greater tolerance of ambiguity (McQuarrie and Mick, 1992). Herein, ambiguity tolerance is conceptualized as the capacity to manage ambiguous situations, i.e., ones that cannot be adequately categorized. The scale thus gauges the degree to which an individual perceives ambiguous situations as desirable and their typical reactions to such situations. Individuals with low ambiguity tolerance typically exhibit aversion to undefined stimuli, whereas those with high ambiguity tolerance often respond to such stimuli with curiosity. Low ambiguity tolerance may elicit a sense of threat and limit engagement in atypical experiences, whereas high ambiguity tolerance may stimulate satisfaction and enhance activity (Thalbourne and Houran, 2000). Given that our study involved participants who are native speakers of Polish, we utilized the Polish adaptation of the Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale (Czajeczny, 2016).\nRumination-Reflection Questionnaire\nThe Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire is made up of 13 items. Individuals rate each item on a scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). These 13 statements comprise six items diagnosing rumination (one item is reverse scored) and seven for reflectiveness (two are reverse-scored). The score is calculated by summing the points for each part. For rumination, one can receive from 6 to 30 points, and for reflectiveness, from 7 to 35 points. The higher the sum score, the more pronounced the characteristic (Trapnell and Campbell, 1999). These scales measure two types of thoughts that arise, for example, in new situations. Ruminations are maladaptive thoughts that unnecessarily consume a large part of cognitive resources and consequently hinder the performance of new tasks (they, of course, also have many other consequences). They are, therefore, a type of neurotic self-focused thoughts. On the other hand, reflectiveness refers to adaptive thoughts that open the mind to new experiences and facilitate the performance of cognitive tasks (and improve functioning in several other areas). Thus, these are epistemic self-focused thoughts (Thomsen et al., 2013). In our study, we used the Polish version of the Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire (Radon, 2014).\nEEG\nThe power ratio of theta to beta frequencies (Theta/Beta Ratio, TBR) in spontaneous EEG is a widely recognized biomarker for cognitive control, where lower TBR indicates a higher level of attentional (Angelidis et al., 2016) and executive control (van Son et al., 2019), and cognitive processing (Clarke et al., 2019). Therefore, a decrease in TBR is indicative of an enhancement in cognitive functioning, whereas an increase in TBR suggests a decline in cognitive performance. To determine TBR, we collected the EEG signals using an amplifier (ProComp 2, Thought Technology) connected to a gold-plated active FCz electrode, adhering to the international standard 10-10 electrode placement system. Reference and ground electrodes were attached to the left and right earlobes, respectively. During the measurement, the impedance was kept below 5 k\u03a9 for each channel, and the sampling frequency of the EEG signal was set at 256 Hz. We used the diagnostic protocol (built into BioGraph Infiniti Software, Thought Technology), which consisted of three parts, each lasting 60 s. The first two parts were conducted in the resting state with the participant\u2019s eyes open and then closed. The last part involved the cognitive state, during which the participant was asked to silently read text displayed on the screen of a 21.5-in. Apple iMac computer, which was positioned ~57 cm away from the participant. Following the collection, the EEG signal was preserved for subsequent offline analysis. After removing eye and muscle artifacts, the signal was segmented into frequency bands based on the Fourier Transform with the range designated as 4\u20138 Hz for theta and 13\u201330 Hz for beta waves. Based on this, the TBR was computed individually for each segment and finally for the entire measurement duration.\nSustained Attention to Response Task\nThe Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) was employed to measure participants\u2019 ability to sustain attention. This Go/No-Go task requires participants to react to and inhibit reactions to specific stimuli across 225 trials. During the initial 250 ms of each trial, either a Go stimulus, represented by digits from 1 to 9 excluding 3, or a No-Go stimulus, represented by the digit 3, is presented, followed by a mask (a diagonal cross inscribed in a ring) for 900 ms. The presentation of numbers is pseudo-randomized, with each digit appearing 25 times and never consecutively. The size of the white font displayed on a black screen is also randomized (48, 72, 94, 100, and 120 points). Participants are instructed to respond to Go stimuli by pressing the keyboard\u2019s spacebar and withhold their reaction when the digit 3 appears on the screen, emphasizing both accuracy and speed of responses equally. The test is preceded by a training session of 18 trials, including two No-Go trials. We used the online SART test on the Psytoolkit platform (version 3.4.4) for non-commercial research purposes (Stoet, 2010, 2017). One of its advantages is the ability to edit the code provided on the website freely. Since the Psytoolkit\u2019s SART slightly differs from the original version, we made minor modifications to the code (removed the error message; the modified code is available in the Open Science Framework database: https://osf.io/wpk4c) to align it with the version developed by Robertson et al.1997). We tested using the Firefox browser on an Apple iMac 21.5-in. computer. Participants performed the task seated ~57 cm away from the screen, using a wired Apple keyboard (they pressed the spacebar with both index fingers). Psytoolkit recorded data for the SART test, including reaction time and response accuracy for each stimulus. Based on these data, we calculated the percentage correctness of the reaction for all Go stimuli and separately for No-Go stimuli, as well as the average reaction time for Go stimuli. Additionally, we calculated a skill index by dividing the correct response to No-Go stimuli by the average reaction time to Go stimuli and multiplying the result by 1000. This index better reflects the efficiency of task performance (Jonker et al., 2013) and thus better represents the general ability to sustain attention, with higher scores indicating better test performance. Responses to Go stimuli with reaction times more than two standard deviations above or below the mean were excluded from all analyses.\nMatrix Reasoning Item Bank test\nThe Matrix Reasoning Item Bank (MaRs-IB) test assesses individuals\u2019 inductive reasoning. This test is considered a good indicator of fluid intelligence correlated with reasoning, problem-solving, and learning abilities. Therefore, MaRs-IB is used to assess the efficiency of complex cognitive processes. It is also a good indicator of working memory capacity, which is the aspect of cognition most often affected by noise (Chierchia et al., 2019; Klichowski, 2024). It does not require a psychology degree for administration and is freely available for research (https://osf.io/g96f4/). Moreover, it can be simply implemented in computer-based experiments. The design of MaRs-IB is similar to Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices (Raven, 2009). It consists of three-by-three matrices filled with abstract shapes, with the bottom right-hand side cell always empty. The participant\u2019s task is to analyze the relationships between the shapes in the cells (which could vary across color, size, position, and shape) and select the missing shape from a set of four possible answers (an example matrix is shown in Fig. 5a). (Chierchia et al., 2019) developed three counterbalanced test forms, each with 80 matrices differing only in the exact shape. Thanks to this, it is possible to implement selected test forms in procedures with a pre-test or baseline and a post-test or intervention without repeating the same trials. Additionally, items can be freely adapted and selected for tasks of different duration and difficulty levels. Therefore, following the approach of Jaeggi et al. (2014), who divided the 36 matrices from the advanced version of Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices into pre-test/baseline and post-test/intervention, we prepared similar (modeled on the Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices test) sets based on MaRs-IB matrices. We have already used them in our recent study, and the detailed description and the adjustment procedure are shown in our paper (Klichowski et al., 2023). Briefly, we selected the 18 most difficult matrices from two test forms, arranged by the number of transformations, and we verified the reliability of this test for baseline-intervention comparisons (selected matrices are available in the Open Science Framework database: https://osf.io/kp48h). In the current study, participants had 60 s to solve one matrix, with a clock symbol appearing on the screen after 50 s to indicate the remaining 10 s. If no response was given within 1 min, the software automatically moved to the next trial. At the same time, the participants were informed that the tasks should be completed as correctly and quickly as possible, so as soon as they knew the answer, they should provide it and continue to the following matrix. Participants were required to complete two training trials before taking the test. They performed the task on an Apple iMac 21.5-in. computer, using a certified pad (Cedrus RB-730) to provide answers and SuperLab 6.1.2 software, which ran tests and recorded data for analysis. Based on these data, we calculated the accuracy as a percentage of correct responses to all trials, the total test completion time, and the average response time for only correctly answered matrices in both study phases. Since the matrices in parts one and two were analogously related pairs of the same difficulty level and type, we could compare them. So, for this last analysis, we matched them together and removed reaction time from any matrices that were only solved correctly in the first or second section of the study. Subsequently, we separately calculated the average reaction time for the remaining responses in baseline and intervention. Trials with response times under 250 ms were not included in the analyses.\nDepression, Anxiety and Stress Scale\nThe Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS) is a self-report instrument developed to assess an individual\u2019s emotional states over a specific period of time (Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995). The DASS questionnaire is open-access, and its administration does not necessitate any particular qualifications or skills. It can be downloaded from the official website and copied without restriction. The scale is available in several versions: the original DASS-42 and two shorter versions, DASS-12, as well as DASS-21, which we used in this study. Owing to its ability to reduce response time while preserving high reliability, DASS-21 is recommended for research applications. It includes 21 items divided into three subscales, each corresponding to a negative emotional state: depression, anxiety, and tension/stress. Participants are asked to select a number from 0 to 3 that best represents the extent to which the statement applies to them over a specified period, which in our study was the duration of experimental noise exposure. Scores are calculated for each subscale separately and for the entire test, then multiplied by 2 to enable comparison with results from the DASS-42, with higher scores (range for a single scale 0\u201342 points and the entire test 0\u2013126 points) indicating greater severity of negative emotional symptoms. While our primary objective was to examine stress, necessitating the use of the corresponding subscale, the authors of the tool note that this subscale pertains to a narrow understanding of stress. Given the close interrelation of the emotional states investigated in the questionnaire, a broader understanding of stress can be achieved by using all three subscales together. Consequently, we administered the entire DASS-21 questionnaire. However, we focused our analysis solely on the stress subscale results and the overall test outcome, omitting the results of the depression and anxiety scales themselves. We used the Polish translation of the DASS form, the factorial validity of which has been confirmed (Makara-Studzinska et al., 2022).\nNoise annoyance\nAnnoyance caused by noise was evaluated using a modified 11-point scale from the International Commission on Biological Effects of Noise (ICBEN) (Fields et al., 2001). This scale is a standardized way of assessing noise annoyance and is part of the procedure for assessing noise annoyance contained in the ISO/TS 15666:2021 standard; therefore, it is widely used in noise research (Clark et al., 2021). Participants were instructed to select a number that most accurately represented the level of disturbance, irritation, or annoyance they experienced from the sounds while conducting the experimental task. The ICBEN scale extends from 0 to 10, where 0 signifies a situation where the sounds were not annoying, and 10 denotes extreme annoyance induced by the sounds. If a noise source is rated 7 points or higher, then this indicates a high level of annoyance with the noise source being evaluated.\nAcoustic conditions\nIn the study conducted, our focus was on two distinct types of noise. The first type was road traffic noise, predominantly generated by vehicles in transit on the highway. The second type of stimulus was the noise produced by an operational wind turbine.\nIt should be noted that in practically all cases of the most used 2 MW wind turbines, the distance between the wind turbines and residential areas is no less than 500 m. For this reason, in the study setting, we assumed exactly this least favorable case of wind turbine location concerning areas people use. The sound pressure levels of wind turbine noise (as well as road traffic noise) were at 65.4 dB SPL. This sound pressure level corresponds to the actual average noise level of a wind turbine at 500 m. Thus, the study\u2019s conditions should be considered boundary conditions under which wind turbine noise may be generated soon. However, wind turbine and road traffic noise levels used in the study were not hazardous to health, as levels of 65 dB SPL correspond to the average level of speech during conversation.\nTo ensure a high degree of ecological validity, we utilized recordings of real-world noises and implemented them in an experimental setup using acoustically sophisticated procedures for playback. The subsequent sections provide a detailed account of the approach to obtaining these recordings and the procedure adopted for their experimental playback.\nRoad traffic noise\nRoad traffic noise, characterized by the sounds of cars and trucks moving on the highway during peak traffic, was recorded outdoor at a distance of 500 m from the A2 highway near Poznan, a large city in Poland. The recording was facilitated using a RODE NTSF1 ambisonic microphone, positioned at a height of 1.5 m relative to the ground level and connected to a SQuadriga II digital recording device. A Svantek SVAN 979 1. class sound level meter microphone was also deployed adjacent to the ambisonic microphone to measure the sound levels. From the recorded road traffic noise, a 15-min signal was selected. This signal was then duplicated three times to prepare a one-hour recording, which was subsequently presented to the participants during the experiment. Due to the continuous flow of vehicles on the highway, individual passes cannot be distinguished from the noise of road traffic. During the tests, the equivalent level of road traffic noise was set at LRTNeq = 65.4 dB SPL (56.8 dBA).\nWind turbine noise\nThe noise emitted by a single operational wind turbine was recorded outdoor at one of the wind farms located near Poznan. The recording was facilitated using a RODE NTSF1 ambisonic microphone, which was connected to a SQuadriga II digital recorder. A Svantek SVAN 979 first-class sound level meter microphone was used to control the sound levels. Both microphones were positioned at a height of 1.5 m relative to the ground level and were distanced 500 m from the wind turbine. The recordings were made for a typical 2 MW wind turbine commonly used in the country\u2019s wind farms, with a nacelle at 105 m and a rotor diameter of 90 m. During the recording session, the wind speed at the wind turbine hub height (105 m) was 8.2 m per second; at 10 m above the ground, it was ~4.5 m per second; and at the height of 1.5 m, the wind speed was less than 1 meter per second. The wind did not compromise the quality of the sound recordings. A seven-minute segment of the wind turbine noise signal was selected from the collected recordings and looped to generate one-hour sound material for the experiments. The wind turbine noise was characterized by periodic fluctuations in the sound level, known as amplitude modulation. The average modulation rate was 0.8\u20131 Hz, while the modulation depth, on average, stood around 6.9 dB. During the experiment, the equivalent noise level of the wind turbine was LWTNeq = 65.4 dB SPL (38.5 dBA). This level was equal to the equivalent level of road traffic noise. Both recordings (road traffic and wind turbine noise) which have been developed are available in the Open Science Framework database: https://osf.io/wpk4c.\nRoad traffic noise and wind turbine noise playback\nParticipants were presented with the original wind turbine/road traffic noise sounds as they were recorded in the environment, also keeping the sound pressure level of the sounds presented. The sounds were not filtered. The road traffic and wind turbine noise recordings were played back in an acoustically isolated room. The playback was facilitated using an Apple iMac 21.5-in. computer, which was connected to two Yamaha HS5 speakers and a Velodyne EQ-Max 15 subwoofer. Both the road traffic and wind turbine noise had equivalent levels of 65.4 dB SPL. The 1/3 octave spectra of the road traffic and wind turbine noise are depicted in Fig. 2a. The speakers were symmetrically positioned on the left and right sides relative to the participant, maintaining a distance of 1 m, and were aligned with the height of the listener\u2019s head. Figure 2b shows an arrangement of the locations of the sound sources. The sounds were calibrated using a Class 1 SVANTEK SVAN 979 sound level meter in the test room. The calibration microphone, connected to the sound level meter, was located where the test subject\u2019s head was during listening. Equivalent sound levels were measured during calibration. The gain was selected to obtain equivalent sound levels of 65.4 dB SPL for both wind turbine and road traffic noise. This test set replicates the situation where a person is exposed to a wind turbine or road traffic noise outside their property or inside a room with a window open (i.e., without the noise reduction provided by a closed window).\nData analysis\nInitially, we employed a repeated measures ANOVA for each dependent variable with time (baseline/first section of the study, intervention/second section) as the repeated measure factors and group (wind turbine noise, road traffic noise, silence) as between-subject factors. The Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied where appropriate. We utilized partial eta squared (\u03b7\u00b2p) to gauge the effect size. Subsequently, we computed the changes/delta (\u0394) between intervention and baseline measurements by subtracting the baseline value from the second measurement result. Then, using a one-way ANOVA with group as a grouping variable, we compared the differences in mean \u0394 between groups, as well as in the assessment of stress and annoyance levels. All necessary post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons were conducted with an additional Tukey\u2019s correction. Finally, we performed a Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis between the assessed levels of stress and annoyance and the values obtained from the scales of ambiguity tolerance, rumination, and reflection. All statistical analyses were executed using jamovi (Version 2.3.18.0) for Mac (Lenth, 2020; R Core Team, 2021; Singmann, 2018; The jamovi project, 2022), and the jamovi file with anonymized data is available in the Open Science Framework database: https://osf.io/wpk4c. Prior to any analyses, a combination of visual methods using Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plots and assessment using skewness and kurtosis was employed to examine indicators related to the shape of the distribution (Ghasemi and Zahediasl, 2012; Kim, 2013). The level of significance adopted was \u03b1 = 0.05.\nResults\nAlterations in neural dynamics\nIn our pilot study, we found no significant main effect of time on neural dynamics during the resting state (Fig. 3a, b), irrespective of whether the eyes were open (F1,42 = 0.270, p = 0.606, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.006) or closed (F1,42 = 2.806, p = 0.101, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.063). A similar observation was made for the main effect of group, which remained non-significant in both phases (F2,42 = 0.636, p = 0.534, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.029 and F2,42 = 0.927, p = 0.404, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.042, respectively). However, an effect of time was noted for the cognitive state (F1,42 = 5.168, p = 0.028, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.110), as indicated by a deterioration in TBR by 0.04 (from 1.15 to 1.19, t = 2.273, df = 42, Tukey\u2019s p = 0.028). Despite this observation, the main effect of group did not reach significance (F2,42 = 1.451, p = 0.246, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.065). Moreover, the time \u00d7 group interaction was also non-significant (F2,42 = 1.049, p = 0.359, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.048; Fig. 3c). Consequently, the change in TBR over the entire measurement duration merely showed a trend (F1,42 = 3.296, p = 0.077, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.073) toward worsening (by 0.03, from 1.15) without reaching statistical significance (t = 1.815, df = 42, Tukey\u2019s p = 0.077). Furthermore, neither the effect of group (F2,42 = 1.096, p = 0.343, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.050) nor the time \u00d7 group interaction (F2,42 = 0.562, p = 0.574, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.026) were significant for overall TBR (Fig. 3d).\nUltimately, the group variable did not manifest as a distinguishing factor for the average \u0394 derived from the EEG recordings. No significant differences were detected in TBR during various states when comparing the groups. This includes the resting state with the participant\u2019s eyes open (F2,42 = 0.053, p = 0.949), the resting state with the participant\u2019s eyes closed (F2,42 = 0.352, p = 0.705), the cognitive state (F2,42 = 1.049, p = 0.359), and throughout the entire duration of the measurement (F2,42 = 0.562, p = 0.574). In other words, the observed deterioration in neural dynamics in the cognitive state and the negative trend in global TBR were not attributable to exposure to wind turbine (or control) noise. Instead, these effects were likely due to cognitive fatigue resulting from participation in a relatively long experiment or other factors.\nEffects on cognitive behaviors\nAlthough we observed a main effect of time in some instances involving improved cognitive functioning as a specific manifestation of gaining skills and learning, we did not detect a group effect anywhere. Moreover, none of the interactions of time and group were significant.\nFor sustained attention, an improvement occurred in the accuracy of responses to Go stimuli (F1,42 = 5.377, p = 0.025, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.113) as such that the participants improved their score by an average 0.57% (from 98.41% to 98.98%, t = 2.319, df = 42, Tukey\u2019s p = 0.025). However, the group effect was not significant here (F2,42 = 1.481, p = 0.239, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.066). Also, the time \u00d7 group interaction was not significant (F2,42 = 0.267, p = 0.767, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.013; Fig. 4a). The mean reaction time to Go stimuli (Fig. 4b) did not improve in terms of speed (F1,42 = 0.171, p = 0.682, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.004), and this was a finding that did not differ between groups (F2,42 = 0.681, p = 0.512, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.031). The same was observed for the accuracy of responses to No-Go stimuli (Fig. 4c). There was neither a time effect (F1,42 = 0.537, p = 0.468, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.013) nor a group effect (F2,42 = 0.712, p = 0.193, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.075). Ultimately, the analysis for the skill index (Fig. 4d) did not show a global change (improvement or deterioration) in sustained attention (F1,42 = 0.146, p = 0.705, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.003) and no differences in this respect between groups (F2,42 = 1.480, p = 0.239, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.066).\nConcerning inductive reasoning, improvement occurred in all of the three contexts analyzed (Fig. 5b\u2013d). Regarding the accuracy of responses, the main effect of time was significant (F1,42 = 9.311, p = 0.004, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.181), leading to an average improvement of 7.65% in participants\u2019 performance during the second part of the test (from 60.74% to 68.39%, t = 3.051, df = 42, Tukey\u2019s p = 0.004). This effect was also apparent in the execution speed of the test section (F1,42 = 16.293, p = 0.00023, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.280), with participants completing the second part, on average, 1 min and 42 s faster (from the initial 10 min and 37 s to 8 min and 55 s, t = 4.036, df = 42, Tukey\u2019s p = 0.00023). Moreover, the influence of time extended to the average response time (F1,42 = 37.926, p < 0.00001, \u03b7\u00b2p = 0.475), which was reduced by an average of 6 s in the second part (from 35 s to 29 s, t = 6.158, df = 42, Tukey\u2019s p < 0.00001). Despite these observations, no group effect was detected (all F2,42 < 2.304, all p > 0.112, all \u03b7\u00b2p < 0.099), and the interaction between time and group remained consistently non-significant (all F2,42 < 1.179, all p > 0.318, all \u03b7\u00b2p < 0.053).\nMoreover, the group variable did not emerge as a differentiating factor for the mean \u0394 calculated from the behavioral measurements. Consequently, no differences were observed between groups in terms of the change in response accuracy to Go stimuli (F2,42 = 0.267, p = 0.767), the average reaction time to Go stimuli (F2,42 = 0.589, p = 0.560), the response accuracy to No-Go stimuli (F2,42 = 0.018, p = 0.982), and the sustained attention skill index (F2,42 = 0.051, p = 0.950). Similarly, no disparities were found between groups when it comes to change in the response accuracy during inductive reasoning (F2,42 = 0.395, p = 0.676) and the total test completion time (F2,42 = 0.305, p = 0.739), including the average response time (F2,42 = 1.179, p = 0.318).\nAssessment of stress and annoyance levels, and their psychological underpinnings\nParticipants evaluated the stress induced by the acoustic conditions of the experiment as extremely low, both in terms of the stress subscale (mean=9.27 points, SD = 7.06 points) and the overall emotional score (mean=19.47 points, SD = 14.63 points). In both instances (Fig. 6a, b), no significant differences were detected between the groups (F1,28 = 0.023, p = 0.880 and F1,28 = 0.002, p = 0.961, respectively). A similar pattern was observed in the context of noise annoyance. Participants rated it as minimal (mean=2.00 points, SD = 2.03 points). Moreover, as Fig. 6c and Table 1 show, although wind turbine noise was reported as marginally more annoying than road traffic noise (the mean difference=0.80), this disparity was not significant (F1,28 = 1.167, p = 0.289).\nFurthermore, the distributions of these three variables in response to wind turbine noise did not correlate with the values obtained from the scales of ambiguity tolerance (for the stress subscale r = \u22120.423 and p = 0.116, for the overall emotional score r = \u22120.243 and p = 0.382, for the noise annoyance r = \u22120.397 and p = 0.142; Fig. 7a), rumination (r = 0.252, p = 0.364, r = 0.317, p = 0.249, and r = \u22120.358, p = 0.191, respectively; Fig. 7b), and reflection (r = \u22120.265, p = 0.340, r = \u22120.061, p = 0.829, and r = \u22120.207, p = 0.460; Fig. 7c). Therefore, even a low tolerance for ambiguity or tendencies towards neurotic self-focused thoughts, as well as a diminished capacity for epistemic self-reflection, did not result in maladaptive perceptions of wind turbine noise, which could have an indirect impact on cognitive functioning.\nDiscussion\nThe limitations of previous research approaches leave open the question of whether wind turbine noise directly affects human functioning or if its possible negative impact results from non-acoustic variables, such as socio-culturally constructed beliefs (Michaud et al., 2016; Michaud et al., 2025; Ramalho et al., 2025; Tsionas et al., 2025; Woodland et al., 2024). Considering the social importance of this unresolved issue (Brouwer et al., 2025; le Maitre et al., 2024; Martinez and Iglesias, 2024), we described in this work how cognitive neuroscience techniques and tenets can be applied for a more objective and comprehensive assessment of the impact of wind turbine noise on various mental functions. Apart from outlining the assumptions of such a unique approach, we attempted to apply it in a pilot study. Overall, in line with the proposed approach, we conducted the study under highly controlled conditions (i.e., in a laboratory) while ensuring high ecological validity. Additionally, the primary dependent variable was measured not only at the behavioral level (using recognized psychological tests) but also at the neuronal level (via EEG). The dependent variable itself was cognitive processes associated with everyday mental tasks. The study was also blind regarding the independent variable (acoustic conditions). This was accompanied by controlling psychological and auditory factors, as well as measuring annoyance and stress levels.\nOur results did not show a negative impact of short-term exposure to wind turbine noise on cognitive functions when tested at the neuronal and behavioral levels. Wind turbine noise neither lowered cognitive efficiency nor interfered with learning mechanisms (Figs. 4 and 5), nor changed the natural dynamics of brain waves for a given state (cognitive or rest, Fig. 3). Furthermore, this noise was not perceived as significantly more annoying or stressful than road traffic noise (Fig. 6 and Table 1), even when individuals exhibited maladaptive traits, such as low ambiguity tolerance (Fig. 7a), decreased reflection/epistemic self-focused thoughts (Fig. 7c), and high rumination/neurotic self-focused thoughts (Fig. 7b). Therefore, our initial hypothesis that exposure to wind turbine noise would detrimentally affect cognitive functioning was not validated. The other two hypotheses, namely that wind turbine noise would be perceived as more bothersome and stressful than road traffic noise and that psychological traits moderate its perception, were also not supported.\nHowever, these null results do not negate the potential adverse influence of such noise on human brain processes or the fact that psychological diversity plays no role here. Instead, they indicate that under the conditions proposed in our approach, which are blind to the nature of the acoustic variable and thus detached from the social meanings attributed to wind turbine noise, such effects do not occur. It should be noted that, based on the ICBEN scale results, 14 out of 15 participants exposed to wind turbine noise rated their annoyance as either 0 (n = 4), 1 (n = 3), 3 (n = 2), or 4 (n = 5), indicating minimal disturbance, even in the presence of maladaptive or neurotic psychological traits. Only one individual rated their annoyance as high (at 7), despite a low score for rumination, but with low ambiguity tolerance and reflectivity. This implies that 93% of participants did not find wind turbine noise intrusive (Clark et al., 2021; Fields et al., 2001). As per previous studies, noise would negatively impact the neural dynamics of complex cognitive processes, sustained attention, and inductive reasoning only in case of high annoyance (Astuti et al., 2023; Muller et al., 2023; Pieper et al., 2021). The low annoyance (as well as stress) ratings observed in our exploration would be attributed to the fact that participants were unaware of the nature of the sounds they were exposed to (the procedure was blind, and no volunteers identified experimental sounds as wind turbine noise). Thus, they did not evaluate the noise from the perspective of socially constructed assertions or as a consequence of wind turbine syndrome mechanisms (Clark et al., 2020; Pierpont, 2009; Schaffer et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2020). As a result, they did not experience the nocebo effect (Crichton and Petrie, 2015), and we did not observe any impact of wind turbine noise on their cognitive functioning. This suggests that the sound pressure level of the wind turbine noise used in our study, i.e., 65 dB SPL, which mirrors real-world conditions and has no effect on the onset of hearing loss (Natarajan et al., 2023), does not directly threaten also human cognitive functioning. The real threat likely stems from socially constructed beliefs (Davy et al., 2020; Hanning and Evans, 2012; Hansen and Hansen, 2020; Lundheim et al., 2022; Takeuchi, 2023).\nThis interpretation is compatible with previous findings showing social contexts, such as socialization and misinformation, as a moderator of the interlinkage between wind turbine noise and human functioning (Miedema and Vos, 2003; Obuseh et al., 2025; Pohl et al., 2018; Ramalho et al., 2025; Schaffer et al., 2016). More broadly, it is consistent with approaches emphasizing that concerning wind turbines, the source of annoyance is rooted in non-acoustic variables (Ata Teneler and Hassoy, 2024; McCunney et al., 2014; Schmidt and Klokker, 2014). Nevertheless, further research is needed to confirm the proposed interpretation. For instance, our experiment could be replicated with a placebo-controlled condition, where beliefs are induced. Participants would be informed in one group that they would perform tasks amidst wind turbine noise. In another group, individuals would receive the same instruction but would not be exposed to wind turbine noise. Instead, they would listen to a non-annoying control sound (Klichowski et al., 2023). The results, correlated with psychological scales, could reveal the personality profile of individuals susceptible to wind turbine syndrome; however, it would be necessary to ensure a more diverse and extensive sample than in our experiment (Clark et al., 2020; Crichton and Petrie, 2015; Schaffer et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2020; Taylor et al., 2013; Woodland et al., 2024).\nFuture research should also address the problem of the duration of noise exposure (Alamir et al., 2019; Merino-Martinez et al., 2021). We are uncertain whether we would observe no adverse effects if participants were exposed to noise longer, for example, for several hours. Yet, it is essential to emphasize that our goal was to investigate the direct impact of wind turbine noise on the dynamics of mechanisms controlling cognitive processes. Therefore, short-term exposure to wind turbine noise was appropriate here. Moreover, it was ecologically valid, as people sometimes find themselves where they need to perform short cognitive tasks near wind farms (not while living next to them). However, the results of our study cannot be extrapolated to more frequent situations where exposure to wind turbine noise is much longer (such as for individuals who work or live close to wind farms). Thus, it remains an open question whether prolonged exposure would lead to annoyance and, as a consequence, impair cognitive functions; alternatively, whether or not some habituation may occur in a long-exposure situation and minimize the annoyance (Mutschler et al., 2010). New studies are needed to answer these questions. Duration of exposure should be manipulated in them. Such experiments may take into account, for example, conditions with short exposure (as in our experiment), more prolonged exposure (e.g., 3\u20135 h), and extremely long exposure (e.g., 24 h). To objectively evaluate the impact of different exposure durations to wind turbine noise on various cognitive functions, a between-group study design should be chosen, and the measurement of cognitive process efficiency should be run at the end of each exposure type.\nSome technical and operational contexts should also be considered in further experiments. The wind turbine noise used in the study was recorded during operation at a hub wind speed above 8 m per second. At wind speeds of 8 m per second and above, the turbine generates maximum noise levels, and the sound power level, which uniquely characterizes any sound/noise source, including wind turbines, ranges from 104 to 108 dBA (Hoen et al., 2023). Since the sound power level of any wind turbine reaches its maximum value at a wind speed of 8 m per second, measurements are made at this wind speed (Keith et al., 2016). Additionally, the 2 MW wind turbine is now widely used in wind farms, including in Poland (Talarek et al., 2022), and (Hoen et al., 2023) show that the difference in sound power level between a 2 MW turbine and a larger turbine (up to 5 MW) is at most 4 dB. Thus, it can be assumed that the wind turbine noise recording used in our study represents the situation when the turbine is 500 m away from the observer, reflecting maximum noise levels for such a distance (importantly, without the noise reduction provided by the building facade, Hu et al., 2022). Future studies should use recordings from different wind turbine models or those prepared under different operational conditions, such as starting multiple turbines or varying weather conditions, as additional conditions.\nConclusions\nIn this work, we proposed a cognitive neuroscience approach to experimentally and multifactorially explore the impact of wind turbine noise on various mental functions. The uniqueness of this approach lies in adopting multiple assumptions inspired by cognitive neuroscience methodologies while simultaneously adhering to psychoacoustic research standards previously used in wind energy development studies. In summary, this approach involves conducting highly controlled laboratory experiments using recognized tests and techniques to measure cognitive components associated with everyday mental tasks at both the behavioral and neuronal levels. Additionally, it requires constructing high ecological validity conditions, for example, by using actual recordings of wind turbine noise at volumes characteristic of natural situations as an experimental factor. The approach assumes that participants are blind to the nature and manipulation of acoustic variables and that all participants exhibit standard auditory perception across an extensive frequency spectrum. Furthermore, it includes the control of psychological variables (using reliable and standardized psychological tests) that could render wind turbine noise more annoying and stressful.\nUsing this approach, we conducted a pilot study, the results of which indicate that when participants are exposed to wind turbine noise with a sound pressure level corresponding to real-world situations (i.e., 65 dB SPL) without knowing that it is the sound of an operating wind farm, the noise does not adversely affect brain functions and is not perceived maladaptively, even when individuals have tendencies towards maladaptive thoughts. These results cannot be generalized; however, they support the concept that the interlinkage between exposure to wind turbine noise and human cognitive functioning is not a cause-and-effect relationship but is mediated by socially constructed beliefs about wind farms. Further development of this promising approach could advance research on the wind industry\u2019s impact on human cognition. Undoubtedly, subsequent studies must consider additional elements such as placebo-controlled conditions, manipulation of exposure duration, recordings from different wind turbine models prepared under various operational conditions, and diverse and extensive samples. The results of the studies using our approach extended with the above-mentioned additional procedure criteria could limit misinformation\u2019s role in decision-making or opinion-forming and increase the share of evidence in discussions among stakeholder groups, such as residents, policymakers, and energy developers. Additionally, they could help formulate reliable recommendations regarding wind energy policy.\nData availability\nThe anonymized data generated in the current study is available in the Open Science Framework database: https://osf.io/wpk4c.\nReferences\nAgeborg Morsing J, Smith MG, Ogren M, Thorsson P, Pedersen E, Forssen J, Persson Waye K (2018) Wind turbine noise and sleep: Pilot studies on the influence of noise characteristics.

      "text": "The wind turbines visible from Donald Trump\u2019s Turnberry and Menie golf courses have long enraged the president. At a press conference at his Ayrshire resort announcing a trade deal with the EU this weekend, Trump launched into an unprompted tirade against windfarms, instructing European countries to get rid of theirs. He was visiting Turnberry for the first time since the nearby onshore Kirk Hill windfarm began producing energy from eight turbines.\nBut were his comments about wind power correct?\nIt\u2019s the \u2018most expensive form of energy\u2019\nTrump claimed: \u201cIt is the worst form of energy, the most expensive form of energy, but windmills should not be allowed.\u201d\nThis is certainly not true for onshore wind, which is cheap to build and generates electricity very inexpensively. Offshore windfarms cost more to build but, when it is windy, produce electricity extremely cheaply. There are costs associated with wind; the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has recently faced criticism for setting the maximum price at his upcoming renewable energy auction at \u00a3113 a megawatt-hour for offshore wind, for record-length contracts of 20 years.\nBy comparison, the wholesale gas price is \u00a378/MWh at present. However, during the price spike of 2022, wholesale gas went above \u00a3170/MWh. Because Britain\u2019s electricity grid has not been sufficiently updated, windfarms are also often paid millions to switch off when it is very windy to avoid overloading the network.\nHowever, even with these added costs, offshore wind is less expensive than nuclear to build, has a stable price compared with gas, which is sold on international markets, and is cheaper to generate than fossil fuels.\nTurbines drive whales \u2018loco\u2019\nTrump has often claimed that offshore wind kills whales and drives them crazy.\nIt is tricky to make definitive claims about whether or not whales are driven \u201cloco\u201d by offshore wind, as many aspects of whale behaviour are not well understood by scientists. However, it does not appear there is direct evidence that offshore windfarms frequently cause whale deaths. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said: \u201cThere are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.\u201d\nWhales could be disturbed during the initial stages of offshore-wind construction. High-resolution geophysical surveys to map the seafloor are carried out that could disturb marine mammals. However, these are much smaller in scale than those conducted for oil and gas exploration.\nMost of the known direct causes of whale deaths are related to the fishing industry, with the mammal caught in or ingesting fishing equipment. The warming and acidification of oceans caused by global heating from burning fossil fuels is also a threat to whales\u2019 survival.\nThey kill birds\nTrump said windfarms \u201ckill the birds\u201d, and this is true, to an extent. Birds can collide with the turbines, and offshore windfarms are sometimes constructed in important feeding sites for seabirds such as puffins as they are put in shallow waters where sand eels are found.\nHowever, the proportion of birds killed by turbines is tiny compared with the amount killed, for example, by domestic cats and from flying into power lines. Destroying bird habitat and poisoning their food with pesticides has also had a greater impact on populations than the prevalence of wind turbines.\nSome wind companies are taking action to become less lethal to birds; a project in Norway painted its turbines black, which resulted in 70% fewer bird deaths.\nTurbines only last eight years before having to be binned\nTrump claimed: \u201cWhen they start to rust and rot in eight years you can\u2019t really turn them off, you can\u2019t burn them. They won\u2019t let you bury the propellers, the props, because there\u2019s a certain type of fibre that doesn\u2019t go well with the land.\u201d\nThis is not true. Wind turbines have a typical lifespan of 20-25 years, and the industry is getting better at recycling old parts; according to the National Grid, 96% of a wind turbine is made from recyclable materials. Their outer shell, shafts, gearing and electrical components are typically made from steel, copper, aluminium, other precious metals and recyclable plastics. The blades are made from fibreglass, which is not biodegradable and is indeed typically sent to landfill. However, scientists have found a way to repurpose them into cement, and the blades have been used to create pedestrian footbridges in Ireland and noise barriers for highways in the US.\nThey\u2019re made in China\nHe\u2019s right on this one; China accounts for about 60% of global wind turbine manufacturing. However, the country dominates the rest of the globe on most manufacturing, so this isn\u2019t a surprise.\nThe UK wind manufacturing sector is growing as part of the green economy, providing jobs in post-industrial areas in particular.\nThey\u2019re \u2018killing us\u2019\nTrump claimed wind turbines were killing people. There have been a handful of human deaths linked to turbines, but these are construction accidents. Deaths are not uncommon in many big industries, including oil and gas , but wind turbines do not pose a fatal threat to the general public."

      "text": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| |||||||\n|\nWho Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One) |\n|\n| NOTE: For the second part of this episode, see Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two). |\n| \u201c | Since the beginning of time, man has yearned to destroy the sun. I will do the next best thing: block it out. | \u201e |\n| ~ Mr. Burns |\n\"Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)\" is the twenty-fifth and final episode of Season 6 and the first part of the two-parter \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\". Both parts were originally produced entirely for that season.\nSynopsis[]\nMr. Burns's greed soars to new heights when the elementary school strikes oil, culminating in his blocking out the sun to keep the town in the dark and dependent on his power plant \u2014 and someone tries to stop him by gunning him down. But who?\nFull Story[]\nAt the beginning of the normal ordinary school week, Principal Seymour Skinner opens up the school to find that Superdude, the fourth grade gerbil, has passed away. He gives Groundskeeper Willie the task of burying the gerbil, and in the process Willie strikes oil, causing the school to explode.\nUp on the roof, Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers are inspecting what caused the explosion when a worker comes up and tells them they struck oil. He also holds up the corpse of Superdude. After thanking Superdude, Skinner tosses the gerbil off the roof. Everyone in the school rejoices, as now they have all the money they could ever want. While several teachers want new equipment, other requests are more exorbitant - and are just as quickly approved; Lunchlady Doris wants more staff and a better kitchen, Willie wants a crystal slop bucket and a brand new filthy blanket, Otto Mann wants a double guitar, and Lisa Simpson wants to hire Tito Puente to teach jazz at the school.\nHowever, Charles Montgomery Burns has his eyes on the well, wishing to take the oil for himself in order to secure his energy monopoly over Springfield. He initially attempts to fool Skinner into selling the drilling rights to him by poorly disguising himself as Jimbo Jones, but Skinner immediately sees through the disguise, questioning Burns as to how he thought he could mistake the towns most prominent 104-year old man for one of his elementary school students. Despite Smithers' objections, Burns then organizes a slant drilling operation to tap the oil well before the school can, thereby stealing the oil for himself.\nBurns' drilling operation causes chaos throughout Springfield. The initial jet of oil smashes into Bart's treehouse, leaving it in a wreck, injuring him and breaking Santa's Little Helper's hind legs. The drilling also creates a large sink-hole in the ground under Grampa's retirement home, causing it to collapse and forcing all the occupants to vacate the building until further notice. Abe is forced to move in with the rest of the Simpson family along with his few remaining possessions, including a loaded Smith & Wesson; when Marge demands that he get rid of the gun, Abe buries it in the back yard with Bart. Along with the physical destruction, the toxic fumes from the oil drilling force Moe's Tavern to close until the operation concludes; an angered Moe grabs a shotgun from under the bar. The alcoholic Barney Gumble has now lost his primary beer supply, and after being forced to leave, he pulls out a derringer. Similarly, the barflies Larry and Sam also have nowhere to go. Additionally, Springfield Elementary is unable to take any legal action against Burns, as he is considered owner of the oil after tapping the well first, and can no longer afford any new equipment because the school is now bankrupt from building and dismantling their oil derrick; Willie and Puente are both laid off as a result. Willie vows to kill Burns and maim Smithers right there before running out of the office.\nThe only person whose hatred towards Burns is not directly caused by the oil well is Homer. Instead, the cause of his anger is that despite working for Burns for the last 10 years, meeting with him many times and even introducing him to his family, Burns constantly fails to remember Homer's name. Adding insult to injury, he refers to Homer using various dehumanizing epithets, even when Homer is present, in place of his actual identity. Homer's attempts to get Burns to remember his name are fruitless; after following Marge's suggestion and sending him a box of chocolates with a family photo inside, Burns remembers the rest of the Simpsons but neglects to eat the final chocolate covering Homer's face before disposing on the box. His subsequent thank you letter only mentions Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, enraging Homer to the point that he yells out a profanity that is heard for miles. Homer later breaks into Burns' office and spray paints \"I AM HOMER SIMPSON\" on the wall; when Burns catches him in the act and demands \"Who the devil are you?\", Homer snaps and grabs his boss, shaking him while repeating his name. Burns is unable to understand what Homer is saying and the latter is dragged away by security, yelling to the former that he is a dead man.\nNot even Smithers can stand the acts his beloved employer has undertaken. He dryly points out that Mr. Burns has crushed all his enemies - even though none of those people posed a threat to him. However, Burns declares that he hasn't taken out his biggest enemy: the sun. He reveals to Smithers his grandest scheme yet: since humanity has been trying to destory the sun since the beginning of time, he will do the next best thing and block it out with a giant disc, shrouding Springfield in darkness and thereby forcing its inhabitants to continuously use the electricity from his power plant. Smithers is horrified and points out that all plant life would die, owls would hoot constantly and the town's sundial would become useless, but Burns does not listen and berates Smithers for his insubordination. Smithers finally stands up to his boss, declaring that he will not fall in line until he steps back from the brink of insanity; Burns refuses to back down and fires Smither, who angrily storms out of the office.\nMayor Quimby calls an emergency town meeting; after noticing that many in the audience are stroking guns, he opens the floor, and a number of people complain.\nMr. Burns then shows up, and Bart charges at him in rage. Mr. Burns brandishes a gun hidden in his blazer, stating that he has decided to protect himself ever since he was attacked in his office by an 'unidentified assailant' (Homer, of course). He taunts the townspeople for trying to intimidate him but not having the guts to follow through with their threats.\nFinally, Burns activates his sun-blocker, leaving the town aghast, and walks away, laughing. Just as he leaves, Krusty returns from Reno, although he quickly leaves the area when, having not witnessed Mr. Burns' vile behavior, he sees the townspeople glaring angrily.\nAs Burns relishes in everybody's misery, the citizens of Springfield leave the town hall. Amid an eerie silence, Burns walks down the street, whistling and humming merrily to himself. Whilst this is happening, several people notice a number of strange phenomena:\n- Carl discovers that Mr. Smithers has left his jacket at the town hall.\n- Otto finds that Principal Skinner left his mother Agnes behind at the same hall.\n- Back at the Simpsons residence, the cigar box which held Grampa's gun has been dug up. Frighteningly, apart from a stray bullet, the box is now empty.\n- As Marge places Maggie and Santa's Little Helper into the family car, she suddenly notices that the rest of her family are absent. Curious, she wanders away from the car to search for them.\nUnaware, Mr Burn's remains in a cheerful mood and states that he feels like celebrating. As he is saying this, Burns walks behind a pillar, leaving only a shadow on the wall. Burn's stops suddenly and turns to face somebody hidden from view. Walking towards this person, Mr Burn's completely disappears from view, saying: -\n\"Oh it's you, what are you so happy about? (Gasps) I see. I think you'd better drop it. I said drop it!\"\nHe is then heard struggling with the someone.\nMeanwhile, at the front of Town Hall, Marge noticing that the streets are deserted, asks aloud where everybody has got to? Suddenly, a gunshot is heard. A second later, Mr Burn's staggers out from behind Town Hall, clutching his chest in agony. Refusing to answer a worried but unhelpful Jimbo's question if he's alright, Burns wanders over to and collapses onto the town's sundial. The shocked residents of Springfield gathers around, realizing that the man they all hate and wanted a piece of has just been shot.\nFollowing a bit of tomfoolery from Chief Wiggum, Marge asks how are they going to figure out the shooters identity? Nearly everybody in town had a reason to shoot Mr Burns and is therefore a suspect. There is a pause, in which several citizens look at one another suspiciously. Dr. Hibbert then breaks the silence with a laugh, before saying \"Well I couldn't possibly solve this mystery. Can YOU?\" He points at the screen, towards what is thought to be the viewer, but when the camera pans back, it shows that he is pointing at Chief Wiggum.\nAlthough he does not seem confident, Wiggum says that yes, he will give it a shot, since it is his job as a police officer. An ominous tune plays after this and the words \"To Be Continued\" appear onscreen. Thus, the episode and the season concludes with a cliffhanger.\nSuspects[]\nMarge states that every person in town could be a suspect and it is true that Burns blocked out the sun. However there are certain suspects whose motives are focused on, and the public was assured that the contest was winnable, so there could only be a limited number of suspects - presumably a character present at the Town Meeting who has been seen before. The most obvious suspects at the meeting were...\n- Homer Simpson - lost it after Burns kept forgetting his name, alongside this like Barney, Lenny, Larry, and Sam, he loses Moe's bar.\n- Waylon Smithers - lost his job.\n- Seymour Skinner - lost his oil well.\n- Moe Syzlak - lost his bar.\n- Barney Gumble - lost Moe's bar.\n- Abraham Simpson - lost his retirement home and his magazines.\n- Bart Simpson - his dog's legs were broken and his treehouse was destroyed.\n- Tito Puente - lost his job.\n- Groundskeeper Willie - lost his job and his dream of a crystal slap bucket.\n- Lisa Simpson - lost her music program, she is an animal lover and Santa's Little Helper was injured.\n- However as well as the primary suspects who draw the most attention to themselves at the Town Hall, there are other, less significant characters in the general area and at the Town Hall with potential motives...\n- Dewey Largo - like Tito and Willie, he too lost his job at the school.\n- Lunchlady Doris - she lost her potential canteen staff.\n- Edna Krabappel - the school lost all extra equipment.\n- Miss Hoover - the school lost all extra equipment.\n- Jimbo Jones - Burns stole his clothes to try to dupe Skinner. Unfortunately, Jimbo isn't a suspect, as he is at a same location as Marge and being the first two alongside her who notice Mr. Burns got injured from a gunshot.\n- Old Jewish Man - lost his retirement home and his sunbathing magazines.\n- Jasper Beardley - lost his retirement home.\n- Sideshow Mel - offers to deal with Burns.\n- The Sea Captain - threatens Burns.\n- Apu Nahasapeemapetilon - states that somebody should have dealt with Burns.\n- Snake - Apologizes to Apu for not dealing with Burns and he is a known criminal and has a gun.\n- The barflies Lenny, Larry and Sam - like Barney, they lose Moe's bar.\n- Clancy Wiggum - it's his job to find the shooter and he could pin it on anybody and look like a hero. Wiggum is always carrying a gun and is well known to be corrupt.\n- (Cleared later in part 1) Marge Simpson - \"He's making us all yell!\"\n- Maggie Simpson - Vents her anger at the town meeting, likely because of her connection to her family, who all vented their anger.\n- Santa's Little Helper - his legs were broken because of Burns, and he had shifty eyes.\n- And of course... any other person who had connections to the suspects and wanted to gain revenge on their behalf...\nClues[]\nThere are clues in this episode that rule out many of the suspects.\n- When speaking to his shooter, Burns does not draw his gun, flee or call out for help. Instead he talks almost amicably, before struggling hand-to-hand with them. Burns is a very weak old man, and most people could overwhelm him quickly, so this shows...\n- a) Burns' attacker is not intimidating, partly because...\n- b) Burns' attacker arrives at the scene unarmed, so inevitably...\n- c) Burns' attacker is an opportunist rather than a planner!\n- It is not until Bart runs at Burns that he reveals his gun to the townsfolk, some of whom have brought weapons or made plans. This adds to how Burns was shot by an opportunist who had not yet threatened him, somebody without an obvious motive.\n- Burns recognizes his shooter. This rules out Homer, as throughout the episode, Burns cannot remember his name.\n- Burns is shot with a small-calibre weapon. We hear a single clear gunshot.\n- When Burns collapses on the sundial, we see that his holster is empty. Since he didn't draw it to defend himself, his attacker must have been the one to take it and use it on him, so logically they didn't bring a gun.\n- Burns struggles hand-to-hand before he is shot, so logically his shooter did not bring a melee weapon either.\n- Burns' attacker never speaks nor makes any noise.\n- Smithers says that he never misses an episode of \"Pardon My Zinger\" Earlier in the episode on the TV at Moe's Tavern, we see that Pardon My Zinger airs at 3 PM, the same time as the shooting. Smithers confirms this claim when he is seen leaving the town meeting early - but in a different direction to Burns.\n- When Burns collapses on the sundial after getting shot, his arms - which, if you look at the sundial at a certain angle, resembles clock hands at 3:00 PM - land on W and the S, hinting at the shooter's possible initials; W.S. (Or M.S.)\n- Burns hints at \"stealing candy from a baby\" earlier in the episode.\n- Otto, Carl, and Agnes were all seen in the town hall just moments before Burns was shot. It is extremely unlikely that they would be able to get from inside the town hall to the location Burns was shot behind it in time to shoot him at the time that he was shot, all but clearing all three of them, even if they all lost stuff from Burns' actions.\nBehind the Laughter[]\nPromo Cards[]\nReception[]\nThe episode (and the second part) received positive reviews from critics and the writers of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \"A superb end to the season - and what's more, it's a genuine whodunnit. There's no cheating - all the clues are there.\" \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\" ranked 25th in Entertainment Weekly's Top 25 Simpsons episodes' list, in 2003.\nAs of November 2024, Part One is marked as one of the Top-Rated episodes on IMDB, with a rating of 9.2 out of 10."

  "argos_summary": "The article examines how Trump\u2019s false claims about wind turbines\u2014such as them killing whales, birds, and people\u2014reflect a broader pattern of conspiracy theories surrounding renewable energy. It reviews research showing that a general conspiracy mentality strongly predicts opposition to wind farms, and that specific conspiracy beliefs about a particular project are even more powerful, though providing pro\u2011wind arguments can increase support, especially when no counterarguments are presented. A pilot study on wind\u2011turbine noise found no adverse cognitive or physiological effects at realistic exposure levels, suggesting that perceived harms are largely socially constructed rather than scientifically grounded. The piece also briefly recounts Trump\u2019s wind\u2011turbine statements and includes a summary of the Simpsons episode \u201cWho Shot Mr. Burns?\u201d as an unrelated cultural reference.",
