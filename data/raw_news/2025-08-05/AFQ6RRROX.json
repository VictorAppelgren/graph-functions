  "title": "Canada's Goods Trade Deficit Widens on Machinery Imports",
  "description": "Canada\u2019s merchandise trade deficit reached a record high in the second quarter, with June\u2019s gap between exports and imports expanding.",
  "content": "The country\u2019s trade shortfall with the world widened to C$5.9 billion ($4.3 billion) in June, from C$5.5 billion in May, according to Statistics Canada data Tuesday. That\u2019s slightly lower than the median projection of a C$6.3 billion deficit in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\n\nTotal imports grew 1.4% in June, the first increase in four months. An inbound shipment from the US of high-value equipment for an oil project off the Newfoundland coast led the increase. But excluding the industrial machinery product category, total imports were down 1.9%.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nTotal exports rose 0.9% in June, the second consecutive monthly increase. But higher prices for crude oil and refined petroleum were responsible for most of that growth. In volume terms, total exports were down 0.4%, while imports were up 1.5%.\n\nCanada\u2019s quarterly trade deficit hit C$19 billion in the second quarter, from C$388 million during the first three months of this year. Exports fell 12.8% on a quarterly basis, led by energy products, cars and parts and consumer goods.\n\nWhile the Canadian economy has been resilient in the face of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, its US-reliant trade sector is among the hardest hit. The Trump administration\u2019s sectoral levies on auto, steel and aluminum cratered demand for the Canadian-made products in the US.\n\nCanada\u2019s export weakness has been driven by declining US imports. Data released in the US at the same time on Tuesday showed that country\u2019s trade deficit narrowed in June to the tightest since September 2023 as companies scaled back on imports after a massive surge earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cWhile trade flows should stabilize in the months ahead, the level of trade will remain lower than it was previously due to ongoing US tariff policy and related uncertainty,\u201d Andrew Grantham, economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a report to investors.\n\n\u201cExport volumes may see a temporary boost in July, much like earlier this year when looming tariff changes triggered some front-running,\u201d he said in a report to investors. \u201cHowever, forward-looking data suggests export volumes will stay weak through the rest of the year.\u201d\n\nImports of cars and parts were up 2.9% in June, after two straight monthly declines. But higher shipments from Mexico contributed most to the increase and helped offset decreases of lower imports for engines and parts, which were down due to Canada\u2019s tariff-hit auto production.",
