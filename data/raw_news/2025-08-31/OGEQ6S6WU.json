  "content": "Harmony & Healing has announced the launch of its new Private Benefit Concert program, bringing the energy and connection of live music directly into backyards, wineries, corporate spaces, and private event venues. These intimate, high-energy concert/dance parties not only create unforgettable evenings for hosts and their guests, they also raise vital funds to provide free live musical visits to patients in hospitals, hospices, rehab facilities, and memory care centers.\n\nThe Private Benefit Concert program offers hosts a turnkey way to throw an extraordinary party with a purpose. Harmony & Healing founder David Victor, a former member of the multi-platinum band BOSTON, performs alongside drummer Michael Brandon and bassist Russell Vazquez in their powerhouse trio, \u201cTherapy Dawgs\u201d. The band delivers multiple sets of crowd-pleasing, danceable hits, transforming private venues into unforgettable live music experiences.\n\nUnlike large, formal benefit concerts that require complex logistics, these events are designed to be simpler for the host. Harmony & Healing handles the performance, lighting, sound, and crew, while the host focuses on food and beverages and inviting friends, family, and colleagues to enjoy the show. These events also feature a lively live auction, with prizes such as autographed guitars, exclusive wine tastings, vacation getaways, and VIP tickets to major sporting events or concerts.\n\nEarly hosts are already sharing glowing reviews. Joe Schembri, who hosted a Private Benefit Concert in Danville in June 2025, said, \u201cThe energy was absolutely incredible. David and his band brought such professionalism and heart to our backyard. Our guests are still talking about it months later.\u201d In August 2025, Pleasanton host Geoff Rodgers added, \u201cI was worried about logistics, but the team made it so easy. We raised significant funds while creating memories that will last a lifetime.\u201d\n\nThe concept works because it creates an exclusive, intimate atmosphere that cannot be replicated in larger venues. Guests enjoy the rare experience of a private concert by professional musicians in a relaxed, familiar setting, while knowing that their participation is helping to fund a meaningful cause. Every dollar raised supports Harmony & Healing\u2019s mission to provide no-cost, live musical visits both in-person and via Zoom to patients of all ages and their loved ones.\n\nFounded by David Victor in the San Francisco Bay Area, Harmony & Healing has become known for its compassionate approach to using music as a tool for emotional connection, stress reduction, and joy. These musical visits are not formal music therapy, but rather carefully curated performances that tap into patients\u2019 most cherished memories and associations. The organization\u2019s professional musicians are selected not only for their talent but for their ability to connect on a personal level with patients, families, and caregivers.\n\nPrivate Benefit Concerts are an extension of that mission, allowing supporters to bring the same level of artistry and connection into their own communities while raising the funds that make the free patient visits possible. The money generated from each concert directly supports the organization\u2019s roster of artists, ensuring that patients and their families never pay for the performances they receive.\n\nThe need for this work is ongoing. Patients in hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities often face long days filled with medical procedures and uncertainty. For many, a live musical visit is a welcome break that lifts spirits, rekindles happy memories, and provides moments of genuine human connection. These visits also reach veterans living with PTSD, children in pediatric care, and individuals in memory care, where music can stimulate recognition and response even when other forms of communication have faded.\n\nVictor sees the Private Benefit Concert program as a way to deepen community engagement while sustaining the charity\u2019s impact year-round. \u201cA Private Benefit Concert is more than just a party,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to connect with your friends and neighbors through great music, while knowing that the joy you experience that night is directly bringing comfort and healing to patients in hospice, rehab and hospitals who truly need it.\u201d\n\nHarmony & Healing encourages interested hosts to think creatively about their venues. While many concerts take place in spacious backyards, others are held in wineries, community centers, or corporate settings. The key is creating a welcoming space where guests can relax, enjoy the music, and participate in the fundraising activities.\n\nThe organization provides guidance on event flow, auction timing, and promotion to make each concert as successful as possible. From the moment the band arrives for setup to the final encore, hosts can relax knowing the details are handled. The result is an evening that strengthens community bonds, celebrates live music, and funds a mission that touches lives across the country.\n\nTo learn more about hosting a Private Benefit Concert and becoming part of this growing movement, visit the Harmony & Healing website.\n\nFor more information about Harmony & Healing, contact the company here:",
