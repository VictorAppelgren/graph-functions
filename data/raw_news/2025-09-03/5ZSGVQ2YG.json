      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is the small Android phone I've been waiting for\nFebruary 1, 2025\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro\nMSRP: $999.00\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro\nIf you\u2019ve read any of my many reviews here at Android Authority, you\u2019ll know I like a small phone. You\u2019ll know I appreciated devices like the base Pixel 8 and iPhone 15 because they would fit comfortably in my hand (and pocket) and let me go about my life without feeling like I had a tablet in my pocket.\nBut you\u2019ll also know that smaller phones almost always come with compromises, like ditching a telephoto sensor, trimming a few gigabytes of RAM, or capping the charging speed \u2014 minor cuts that limit the overall experience. I always had to give something up to keep a phone I liked in my pocket, at least until Google launched the Pixel 9 Pro.\nNot too big, not too small\nIf I\u2019ve waxed poetic once about Google\u2019s design evolution over the years, I\u2019ve done it a hundred times \u2014 and now I\u2019ll do it just one more time. After all, Google\u2019s penchant for colorful finishes and clean lines drew me to the Pixel series in the first place, and the Pixel 9 Pro is no exception. In fact, the Pixel 9 Pro specifically might well be the best iteration yet, if only because it finally gives me the top-tier Pixel experience in a phone that I can use one-handed. I think it\u2019s fairly obvious that Google saw what Apple was doing with its two Pro-level iPhones and decided it could do one better.\nThat\u2019s not much of an exaggeration, either \u2014 the Pixel 9 Pro is more iPhone-like than ever. It has a simple G logo on the back instead of a half-eaten apple and a camera bar that\u2019s become more of an island, but the flattened side rails and display are similar enough to make Tim Cook blush. And, like I said when I called the Pixel 9 Pro XL the best iPhone ever, I mean that in the best ways. See, Apple has long set a standard when it comes to smartphone build quality. Whether or not its latest iPhone models look exciting, you know they\u2019ll feel sturdy and reliable. Google\u2019s annual updates, on the other hand, always felt like they had room to improve, either due to super-thin side rails, curved displays prone to accidental touches, or in-display fingerprint readers that weren\u2019t very good.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is the best-made Pixel of all time, and it even fits in my hand.\nNow, it\u2019s hard to even think of those flaws while using the Pixel 9 Pro. Google\u2019s new 6.3-inch AMOLED panel is perfectly flat, yet the slight curve on the back of the aluminum frame allows the phone to sit comfortably in your hand for a long day of usage. Its slightly textured back panel of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 feels ever so slightly more premium than its predecessor, tucking comfortably into the glossy frame rather than sticking out behind it. And, while I thought that glossy frame might have worked against Google\u2019s larger Pixel 9 Pro XL, it\u2019s much easier to admire on a smaller phone that doesn\u2019t feel like you have to hold onto it for dear life. Even if you drop it, the IP68 rating should give you a little peace of mind in dirt and water if you\u2019re out for a weekend away from home. Nevertheless, you\u2019ll definitely want to protect your investment with a suitable case.\nDespite its smaller stature, the Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s display packs the same impressive specs as its top-end sibling. It pairs its slim bezels with an impressive 3,000 nits of peak brightness while holding a solid 2,000 nits in high-brightness mode. Both measures are enough to keep the Pixel 9 Pro easily visible while sitting on the beach during Labor Day weekend on the East Coast \u2014 though I\u2019ve hardly come close to maxing out the phone\u2019s display otherwise. It\u2019s still interrupted by a punch-hole selfie camera, but even that\u2019s about as easy to ignore as the bezels.\nI\u2019ll admit that a small part of me, somewhere deep down, feels slightly disappointed by Google\u2019s newfound maturity. Shrinking the camera bar and giving it durable aluminum edges might make it more durable, but it also means that the days of two-toned Pixels might be gone for good. Its side rails might be easier to hold, yet they\u2019re less distinctive in an ever-evolving Android market. Even the color options feel more muted on the Pixel 9 series, with fun hues like Bay and Mint making way for Rose Quartz and Hazel. They\u2019re still gorgeous, just not as fun or flashy as Pixels of the past.\nHowever, if my biggest complaints are improved durability and slightly grown-up colors, the Pixel 9 Pro is doing many things right. Taking all the best parts of the Pixel 9 Pro XL, it\u2019s easily the most enjoyable Pixel to use in my experience, and it feels like it should set the tone for smaller, lighter phones in the future. The Pixel 9 Pro feels like a message to Samsung, OnePlus, and other Android competitors that a pro-level phone doesn\u2019t need a massive display.\nOh, and the temperature sensor is still here \u2014 just figured I should mention it after Google essentially forgot about it. I\u2019m still struggling to find reasons to use it.\nIt still runs (mostly) like a Pro\nOf course, with Google packing its updated Tensor G4 chipset into a smaller body with less room for cooling components, I was a little nervous about how the Pixel 9 Pro would perform. I figured that any thermal shortcomings associated with the Tensor chip would only be amplified by its new, pocket-friendly residence and that the Pixel 9 Pro might fall a bit behind its full-sized sibling, the Pixel 9 Pro XL. I\u2019m happy to report that I was wrong (mostly).\nAs usual, I put the chipset \u2014 which comes backed by 16GB of RAM and a disappointing 128GB of storage in its base configuration \u2014 through its paces with our usual set of CPU, GPU, and battery tests. But, while you might expect that extra RAM to kick things up a notch, you can only actually use 13GB of it with the remaining 3GB carved out for Gemini. Anyway, I lined it up against its top Android foes and Apple\u2019s more portable Pro, if only so that it could tell me what I already knew: The Tensor G4 is still no benchmarking beast.\nSure, it beat its predecessor, the Tensor G3, in just about all of our testing, but it still has a decent gap to make up before it\u2019s genuinely racing against the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or Apple\u2019s A17 Pro \u2014 though rumor has it that we might see some of those improvements on the Pixel 10. Surprisingly, the Pixel 9 Pro is neck and neck with the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL across most of our workload and CPU tests. It\u2019s not a significant gap \u2014 just a percentage point or two across most of my tests \u2014 but good news for small phone enthusiasts everywhere. That said, the expected dip in GPU performance for the smaller Pixel 9 Pro is pretty visible as the phone drops to the Tensor G3-powered Pixel 8 Pro\u2018s performance after just five runs, while the XL version manages to sustain decent stability for another 10 runs. This is likely due to the reduced room for the new vapor chamber.\nOf course, while we compared the Pixel 9 Pro to the latest from Apple and Google at its launch, things have changed since then. The iPhone 16 series arrived with Apple\u2019s A18 chip under the hood and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 series picked up an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, both of which open the gap a little bit wider over the Tensor G4. So, we\u2019re right back to Google feeling a bit further behind on paper, but we\u2019ll hold out some hope for the next generation to tighten up again.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro's performance keeps up with the XL model... mostly.\nThankfully, the Pixel 9 Pro feels just as capable as its sibling in day-to-day use. I headed down to the Jersey shore for a holiday weekend and compared my Pixel 9 Pro head-to-head against the Pixel 9 Pro XL my dad recently bought from Verizon. We started our days at about the same time, me kicking off my day with a mix of Spotify streaming and checking the Chelsea FC score a few times throughout a five-mile run and him heading to the end of the island to capture some photos and see how the cameras compared to the Galaxy S21 Ultra that he traded in.\nThe rest of the day saw us use our Pixels a bit closer together, sitting in the sun and sand and putting the Tensor G4 under a bit more thermal load than it probably would have liked. I put my Pixel 9 Pro through an hour or so of gaming, split between Royal Match and Warhammer 40,000: Tacticus, which warmed it up a bit, but never to the point where I needed to hide it in the shade to let it cool off. Even though my stretch of gaming didn\u2019t cook the Tensor G4, it did show me one thing \u2014 the Pixel 9 Pro has a bit of a battery weakness.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking \u2014 of course, the Pixel 9 Pro puts in a shorter battery shift than Google\u2019s other Pro-grade Pixels; it has a smaller battery (over ~300mAh smaller than the XL). That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s also powering a smaller display, so I was still surprised to see such a gap in our battery drain testing. It fell short of the Pixel 9 Pro XL by a pretty good margin across all categories, faring the worst when 4K video was involved \u2014 either recording or playback.\nThe smaller Pixel\u2019s Zoom and web results are a bit more respectable, and it leads Google\u2019s trio in gaming durability, but it\u2019s not enough that you can expect two full days of usage between charges. Real life involves a better mix of usage, so you might not feel the effects of poor gaming battery usage, but I found myself reaching for a charger more than every 36 hours.\nWhen you need a charge, you\u2019ll run into another one of Google\u2019s puzzling Pixel decisions. Even though it bumped the Pixel 9 Pro XL\u2019s wired charging up to 37W, it left the Pixel 9 Pro behind with 27W wired charging with a USB PD PPS-enabled charger. Strangely, that\u2019s the same speed the previous Pixel 8 Pro supported, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the graph above. The Pixel 9 Pro took almost 90 minutes to fill with Google\u2019s brand-new 45W charger, while the Pixel 8 Pro filled its larger battery nearly 10 minutes quicker with an older 68W Motorola TurboPower charger I had lying around.\nInterestingly, our testing showed that the Pixel 9 Pro spent more time charging at near-peak speeds (21 minutes instead of 19), but it reached a top temperature of 42.2 degrees Celsius compared to the Pixel 8 Pro\u2019s 38.2 degrees, which is likely where you see the dropoff at around the 35-minute mark above. Thankfully, though, the Pixel 9 Pro appears capable of reaching its full 27W speeds from that same TurboPower charger that I\u2019ve trusted for a few years \u2014 unlike the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which seems to require an extra special set of chargers to reach its full potential due to weird interactions with charger voltage.\nYou can also skip Google\u2019s headache of a wired setup and charge your Pixel 9 Pro wirelessly, in which case it\u2019ll reach 21W with the second-generation Pixel Stand ($79 at Best Buy) or 12W from any other Qi-certified pad. I wish I could make complete sense of Google\u2019s plan for its charging setup, but alas, Goog\u2019 gonna Goog\u2019.\nPortable Pixel cameras\nOne thing I wasn\u2019t worried about was Google\u2019s cameras not living up to the hype on the Pixel 9 Pro. After all, it packs the same trio of high-resolution sensors I just finished testing on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, just in an easier-to-wield form factor. That means you once again have a 50MP primary sensor with a shallow maximum aperture of \u0192/1.7 with which to capture your world, as well as ultrawide and telephoto sensors to back it up. They fill out the camera bar nicely and make the Pixel 9 Pro one of the best camera phones around \u2014 especially at its size.\nBoth of Google\u2019s peripheral lenses offer matching 48MP resolutions but are pretty much opposites otherwise. The ultrawide snapper gained the same maximum aperture as the primary camera but swapped to a slightly tighter 123-degree field of view \u2014 just like the Pixel 9 Pro XL. While you probably won\u2019t notice that loss of three degrees, you\u2019ll probably welcome the extra light capture, which should make it easier to grab macro shots using Google\u2019s software-based solution. Oh, and it\u2019s a little easier to get close to your subject with the smaller 6.3-inch footprint. The Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s periscope telephoto sensor offers less of a change from its predecessor, sticking with 5x optical zoom and reaching up to 30x Super Res Zoom. Let\u2019s head to the beach to check out a few camera samples.\nFirst, proof that Google still knows how to shoot and process a well-lit photo. My weekend at the beach wasn\u2019t quite as adventurous or colorful as my trips to Pittsburgh and Washington, DC, with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but I found that the smaller Pixel 9 Pro was just as willing to pull details out of shots throughout its zoom range. I\u2019m particularly pleased with the photo of the sun setting over the bay, which caught everything from the color of the sky to the small birds on the dock and kept the wood boards in the foreground in soft focus.\nThe image of the capybara in the second row is good, too, even if the water around the world\u2019s largest rodent is pretty gross. Google nailed the colors of the floating leaves and the shade as it falls across the animal\u2019s fur, and you can just about make out the turtle swimming just below the surface of the background. I would have liked a little more pop in the image of the boats next to it, though, which looks a little bit dead and flat.\nThankfully, I got all the pop I wanted on an evening walk downtown. The Pixel 9 Pro gave the middle image of a neon sign plenty of glow in the building and on the tree in the background while preserving the barely visible telephone wires overhead. I\u2019m impressed that you can still make out a bit of green in the leaves in the shot to the left, too \u2014 low-light photos often crush those clusters to blackness.\nI\u2019ve said this before, too \u2014 macro mode should always be software-based, and the Pixel 9 Pro shows why. It gives its 48MP ultrawide sensor double duty, and the wide-open aperture means that it can grab more light to process. The result is a snail shell that shows every last grain of sand and a Black-Eyed Susan with plenty of detail through its \u201cblack eye.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s overall zoom range is pretty impressive, too. I would typically bin almost all of my 10x and 30x samples shortly after writing a review, but I\u2019m pleased with the details in the seagull and the tracks in the sand at 10x zoom. Our feathered friend is a little bit fuzzier at 30x zoom, but you can still make out that he\u2019d come to steal your hotdog if given a chance.\nAnd then, there\u2019s Google\u2019s updated selection of AI-powered features. I already mentioned that I liked the revamp of panorama mode on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and it\u2019s just as good here. It\u2019s incredibly simple to line up your shot across a series of dots rather than trusting a steady hand, even if there\u2019s a tiny processing error along the dock to the right side.\nUnfortunately, Zoom Enhance isn\u2019t quite as impressive. It took almost a year to launch after being announced alongside the Pixel 8 Pro, but the result is a photo that looks far too sharp in some places while not looking much different in others. The patriotic badge to the right seems almost like it\u2019s been cut with a laser to capture the leaves and outline, giving it edges that are much too sharp. Rather than Zoom Enhance, the feature feels more like Zoom Oversharpen, and sharper isn\u2019t always better.\nZoom Enhance? More like Zoom Oversharpen... which isn't the same thing.\nOther AI-powered features let you be a little more creative, like the improved Reimagine option in Magic Editor. On top of resizing and rearranging elements of your shot, you can now replace the sky, the ground, and things your subject is holding with a tap and a little typing. The Pixel 9 Pro still gets a little fuzzy at the edges of its image generation, but it\u2019s significantly better than the artifact-heavy version launched with the previous generation.\nGoogle gave the Pixel 9 Pro the same selfie camera overhaul as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which remains one of the bigger surprises in this year\u2019s camera setup. It packed a 42MP sensor into its punch hole, which captured more accurate colors and details when I compared it to the base Pixel 9\u2019s 10.5MP shooter.\nI could copy and paste the Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s video chops if I wanted to, too \u2014 they\u2019re the same as the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It can shoot clips at up to 20x Super Res Zoom, which Google will then apply Video Boost for smoother, sharper final results. The Pixel 9 Pro can upscale videos to 8K resolution, from which you can clip 33MP stills.\nYou can also check out full-resolution versions of these samples (and several more) at this Google Drive link. Oh, and if you want even more samples from the Pixel 9 Pro XL \u2014 which has the same hardware \u2014 we have a gallery of those at this Google Drive link.\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s Gemini\nAs you\u2019ve probably figured out, everything the Pixel 9 Pro XL can do, the Pixel 9 Pro can do too \u2014 just smaller. That, of course, includes its mountain of AI-powered capabilities. I\u2019ve already touched on a few camera-focused features above, but they\u2019re only the start of Google\u2019s lofty plans for the Gemini age.\nAnd yes, I still have reservations about everything I do being used to train Gemini (one week in Pixel-land isn\u2019t enough to change that), but Google\u2019s finished product is much better than the current offerings from Samsung, Motorola, and other phone brands hurriedly jumping into the AI race. Maybe it rushed a few things to market on the Pixel 8 series and launched its Gemini Assistant without giving it the power to, well, assist with your smart home, but it\u2019s clear that Google has learned a lot in the last year or so.\nGemini has come an impressively long way in just one generation, whether I'm creating images or asking tricky questions.\nEverything feels a little smoother and quicker, whether you\u2019re chatting with a revamped and interruptible Gemini Live or generating images from text in Pixel Studio. I\u2019ll admit that since swapping from the Pixel 9 Pro XL to the Pixel 9 Pro, I\u2019ve been a bit more inclined to use the latter than the former \u2014 but that\u2019s more so I wouldn\u2019t have to explain the concept of Gemini Live to my grandparents while sharing a beach house for the weekend. The fact still stands that Gemini Live, with its eight interchangeable voices, is scary good, just in a way that I think would freak out two people who currently use a Motorola Moto G Play from 2021.\nOn the other hand, Pixel Studio feels like something every parent wishes they had when their kid asked them to draw something. In fact, that\u2019s kind of how I explained it while showing off my \u201csmartphone of the week,\u201d as my family calls it. This time, I stuck to a theme of beach-related creations, putting animals on surfboards and burying treasure on 85th Street, and the Pixel Studio continued to show off its Imagen 3-powered chops. You still can\u2019t generate people, though, making the overall experience much different from Samsung\u2019s Portrait Studio.\nOther features, like the revamped Pixel Weather app and all-new Pixel Screenshots app, are more like the unsung heroes of Google\u2019s Gemini revolution. You might not notice things like organizable widgets for the air pressure and wind direction if you never scroll past the hourly forecast and radar, but the AI-generated Weather Report is like the one-sentence reminder your mom used to give you before you headed out the door for school in the morning. I\u2019ll also readily admit that I\u2019m not a screenshot guy \u2014 preferring to leave a billion Chrome tabs open as reminders \u2014 but I might start changing my tune if I can remember to make folders every time I research seven vs seven soccer tactics and look for betting advice during college football season.\nThese are also just the Gemini features we can use so far. Google\u2019s Pixel 9 series is promised software updates for seven years, including Pixel Drops, including security patches, Android versions, and regular feature drops. The Pixel 9 Pro launched with Android 14, which seemed like an unusual step, but it picked up Android 15 shortly after launch.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review verdict: Small and mighty in equal measure\nWhen I finished reviewing the Pixel 9 Pro XL, I called it the phone I\u2019d been waiting for. As it turns out, the Pixel 9 Pro was the phone I actually had been waiting for \u2014 I just didn\u2019t know it. Everything I said about Google\u2019s larger flagship absolutely still rings true, with impressive cameras, an impressive suite of AI-powered features that are mostly user-ready, and a build quality that\u2019s head and shoulders above Pixels of the past. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is a sublime choice for anyone who wants the very best Pixel has ever had to offer and wants it in the biggest package possible. But for me, it\u2019s just far more enjoyable on a phone that I can use with one hand.\nGoogle\u2019s ability to pack this much power into a 6.3-inch smartphone should put other Android flagship series\u2019 on notice. You don\u2019t need to churn out a nearly 7-inch smartphone to call it a Pro or even an Ultra (though I guess that size still justifies the Plus moniker). The Pixel 9 Pro combines a battery capacity that rivals the Galaxy S24 Plus, cameras that out-process the OnePlus 12, and an update commitment that goes up against just about anyone. Factor in its build quality, and there aren\u2019t many phones I\u2019d reach for before this one.\nFinally, a pro-grade Pixel that fits comfortably in my pocket.\nAnd yet, the Pixel 9 Pro isn\u2019t without a few small phone compromises. Google didn\u2019t see fit to bring its fastest charging to its smaller model, nor has it figured out a few of the kinks (thermals and benchmarking) that have plagued the Tensor chip since its earliest days. Perhaps the latter results from the former, but we\u2019ll probably find out when Google makes its anticipated switch from Samsung to TSMC for its next in-house chipset. I don\u2019t think either flaw is a true dealbreaker, though, as the Pixel 9 Pro escapes most of the charging headache that plagues its big brother while feeling just as smooth as any other flagship from day to day.\nBut if you want a solution for at least one of those issues, Google has a Pixel 9 Pro XL ($1099 at Amazon) that it\u2019ll sell you. It offers almost the same experience as the Pixel 9 Pro, from the flattened-out design to the brilliant cameras and Gemini infusion, just bigger. It picks up an extra half-inch of screen real estate to match its 5,060mAh battery and grabs the 37W wired charging that can save you a few minutes \u2014 provided you have one of a particular set of chargers. My colleagues and I don\u2019t often hand out five-star ratings at the end of reviews, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL more than earned its accolades.\nShould you decide to venture outside of Google\u2019s ecosystem, it becomes a bit tougher to choose natural rivals for the Pixel 9 Pro. It\u2019s configured closer to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Plus ($999.99 at Amazon), yet sized to match the base Galaxy S25 ($809.99 at Amazon). Personally, I\u2019d rather have Google\u2019s more natural cameras and more complete AI experience, but I\u2019m sure that some will reach for the Galaxy S25 Plus with its larger 6.7-inch display and faster 45W wired charging at the same price. Both of Samsung\u2019s smaller phones pack the more powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, which might sway users, too, even though it won\u2019t feel any quicker in day-to-day usage.\nAnd then there\u2019s the iPhone \u2014 Google\u2019s twin from another operating system. Whereas the Pixel 9 Pro XL matched up nicely against the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the Pixel 9 Pro is more comfortable against the smaller iPhone 16 Pro ($999 at Amazon). From the side, the two are nearly twins, sharing flat frames and glossy finishes and even matching the placement of their antennas with only the square camera bump and Google\u2019s camera bar to tell them apart, as well as Apple\u2019s new Camera Control, which I\u2019ve only found a few reliable uses for. Of course, going for the iPhone probably means diving headfirst into Apple\u2019s larger ecosystem, which could be quite the investment once you add an Apple Watch and maybe an iPad to replace your current Android alternatives.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nNothing's CMF Phone 1 is a fun, bold budget phone but it has one big drawback for folks like me\nDecember 20, 2024\nNothing CMF Phone 1\nMSRP: $199.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nNothing CMF Phone 1\nEver since features like replaceable batteries disappeared from smartphones, we\u2019ve been begging for someone to bring them back. Some have tried, like the LG G5 with its Friends modules or the Fairphone 5 with its ten interchangeable parts, but neither made a lasting impact. Now, a new device has entered the modular market: Nothing\u2019s budget-friendly CMF Phone 1.\nOn the surface, it seems like a no-brainer \u2014 pack a budget Android phone with some decent specs and make it stand out with interchangeable back panels and accessories like a kickstand. In practice, the CMF Phone 1 doesn\u2019t make life so easy, at least not for someone like me in the US. It\u2019s a phone I\u2019d love to recommend to absolutely anyone looking for a fantastic budget phone for less than $200, but there are some things you need to know before picking one up.\nGo-go gadget, smartphone\nRight out of the box, the CMF Phone 1 looks and feels like something new \u2014 especially in the Light Green or Orange finish. It has a certain industrial flair to it with four screws around the edges and Nothing\u2019s classic dot-based branding on the back panel. In some ways, I think the CMF Phone 1 reminds me of the ill-fated Rabbit R1, but in a much more practical, modular sense than that of the aforementioned square, overcomplicated AI companion.\nUnlike some of Nothing\u2019s other designs, where the industrial inspiration is there for aesthetics, the CMF Phone 1\u2019s screws have a purpose. Yes, they unscrew so you can take the budget-focused device apart \u2014 well, partly apart. It\u2019s not quite as exciting as a truly replaceable battery, but the CMF Phone 1\u2019s four removable screws allow you to remove and replace the back panel to change the color of your device as well as add an optional vegan leather case to it. You\u2019ll, of course, also have to remove the button-shaped Accessory Point in the bottom right corner and the SIM tray on the bottom edge, but those extra pieces allow you to mix and match colors to make your Phone 1 even more unique.\nThe CMF Phone 1 pairs an industrial design with interchangeable parts, and I love the idea of it.\nIf nothing else, this is what I love about the Phone 1 \u2014 I can make it different every day. In addition to those alternative backs I mentioned, you can also pick up practical attachments like a kickstand, a lanyard, and even a card holder to replace your wallet. All three of them attach in the bottom right corner of the Phone 1, which means you can use them \u2014 possibly even more than one of them \u2014 in addition to whatever back plate you\u2019ve chosen for the day. It really is a neat setup, and it gives Nothing\u2019s most affordable phone a way to stand out from most of its budget-minded competition.\nHowever, there\u2019s a problem with the CMF Phone 1 if you\u2019re not an international buyer: It\u2019s practically impossible to get any of the accessories here in the US. Yes, technically, the phone is only available stateside as part of a beta program (which we\u2019ll get back to later), but that doesn\u2019t mean it should be available at all if you can\u2019t take advantage of one of its key selling points. Oh, and the phone comes without an NFC chip \u2014 something I never thought I\u2019d have to say again after Motorola finally added one to its Moto G lineup.\nRight now, the best someone stateside like me can do is look at the splash page for the CMF Phone 1 over at Nothing.tech, see that it has an interchangeable design, and, well, that\u2019s it. You can\u2019t reach a product page to grab a different case, the card holder, or anything else without a very quick 404 error. Users abroad might have a bit better luck \u2014 I was able to view the entire selection of accessories on Nothing\u2019s UK site \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t give me a great feeling about the state of the beta program in the US.\nIf you can get your hands on the accessories, you\u2019ll find they are a little tricky to swap in and out. I realize that Nothing\u2019s choice of flat-head screws for its CMF Phone 1 was probably done with durability in mind (I guess?), but I\u2019ve yet to swap a single screw without the included screwdriver slipping out of the groove about half a dozen times. Once I got all the screws out so I could change the black plastic back panel, I had to spend another ten minutes or so trying to wrestle the piece itself off the phone \u2014 not ideal. Also, the card holder attachment uses different screws altogether, trading the flat heads for small orange knobs that you have to tighten by hand.\nAnd then, there\u2019s Nothing\u2019s choice of materials. Unsurprisingly, given the affordable and replaceable nature of the Phone 1\u2019s parts, almost everything about it is made of plastic. Granted, the frame and the interchangeable accessories are fairly stiff plastic, but it\u2019s plastic nonetheless. That means if you drop it onto a concrete sidewalk while cheering at the Philadelphia Marathon \u2014 even one covered in leaves \u2014 you\u2019ll probably come up with some damage. Ask me how I know.\nNormally, I\u2019d brush off that damage, knowing that it happens, but it has more of a snowball effect on the CMF Phone 1. I, unfortunately, dropped my phone at such an angle that the plastic protecting the display and the frame itself pushed into each other a bit, making it harder to remove the black backing I have attached and replace it with a different color now that it doesn\u2019t sit perfectly. Thankfully, though, the 6.67-inch Gorilla Glass 5 display escaped unscathed. And no, putting the CMF Phone 1 in a case probably wouldn\u2019t have helped, as any case I used would have blocked me from using the accessories.\nWhether you spring for the CMF Phone 1\u2019s fun accessories or not, you\u2019re still getting the light, clean Nothing OS experience, which is worth the price of entry on its own. It\u2019s just as much a piece of the design as the accessories themselves, offering the right mix of dot-based widgets and accents while skipping the bloatware that usually bogs down affordable phones. Of course, the black and white dots might not be for everyone \u2014 they\u2019re occasionally hard to differentiate at a glance \u2014 but I can\u2019t help loving the personality. It\u2019s almost as much fun to swap the widgets and fonts in and out as it is to treat the CMF Phone 1 like a hi-tech Erector set, especially when so many other flavors of Android feel very similar.\nGood performance, but strict limitations\nWhile I\u2019ve come away from my time with the CMF Phone 1 a bit less impressed by its accessories (and their lack of availability), its hardware under the hood somewhat won me over. Like Nothing\u2019s other launches, it packs a mid-level MediaTek Dimensity chipset inside its plastic shell, this time backed by 6GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage at the base configuration \u2014 yet another feature that\u2019s largely disappeared from modern flagship phones.\nIf you need a little more punch, you can grab the Phone 1 with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which might be enough that you don\u2019t have to worry about said microSD slot. Either way, you\u2019ll be backing the Dimensity 7300 chipset, which sounds close to the Dimensity 7200 Pro that Nothing used for both versions of its Phone 2a. Those phones, of course, offer a bit more than the CMF Phone 1 in terms of clock speed and optional RAM \u2014 not to mention price \u2014 so I was curious to see how Nothing\u2019s new budget offering would keep up.\nMore realistically, though, I was curious to see how the Phone 1 would fare against similarly priced competition like Motorola\u2019s Moto G 5G (2024) and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy A15 5G, so I set it up for our standard gauntlet of CPU and GPU benchmarks. Unsurprisingly, the CMF Phone 1 had no problems outpacing its budget foes, breezing past offerings from Motorola and Samsung with ease. It stayed ahead of the respective Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 and Dimensity 6100 Plus processors in our main CPU test and put in a good shift against the Nothing Phone 2a, coming out on top with higher multi-core performance even if it didn\u2019t keep up on the single-core front.\nThe CMF Phone 1 also thumped its affordable Android rivals when I fired up the graphically intensive 3DMark stress tests, nearly tripling the output of both the Moto G 5G (2024) and Galaxy A15 5G. Better yet, it stayed rock-solid across all 20 runs of the test, suggesting that even if the CMF Phone 1 doesn\u2019t stack up like a top-end gaming phone, it should still deliver decent performance in lighter titles and should be able to maintain its level for a while rather than tailing off after a few minutes.\nIn real life, though, the CMF Phone 1 feels even better against most of the budget-focused Android market. Its punchy (for the price tag) chipset is paired with a huge 6.67-inch, 120Hz AMOLED display that\u2019s brighter and sharper than Motorola\u2019s LCD and Samsung\u2019s own 90Hz AMOLED option. While I couldn\u2019t use the CMF Phone 1 away from Wi-Fi (for reasons I\u2019ll get to), it handled my needs as a lightweight gaming phone for Pokemon TCG Pocket and Royal Match just fine. I also used it as my portable soccer studio over Thanksgiving, setting up Paramount Plus to keep up with the Europa League games while the rest of my family stuck to American football, glad to have the Full HD resolution while picking out players during Roma\u2019s last-minute draw against Tottenham.\nMediaTek's Dimension 7300 more than holds its own against affordable US-based chipsets.\nFor the most part, that lightweight reliance on Wi-Fi meant that the CMF Phone 1\u2019s 5,000mAh battery could last me several days between charges. It wasn\u2019t constantly hunting for reliable mobile service (because it wasn\u2019t going to get it), so the passive battery drain was minimal. Of course, to find out how the Phone 1 would handle sustained usage, I put it through our trusty drain test and found that it could once again keep up with the Nothing Phone 2a. Actually, the CMF Phone 1 beat its light-up sibling in quite a few of our use cases, from the simulated Zoom call to repeated camera snaps, and both Nothing devices lasted hours longer than the Galaxy A15 5G and Moto G 5G across most use cases.\nNow that it\u2019s beaten similarly priced options from Motorola and Samsung in several places, it\u2019s time to see how the CMF Phone 1 performs on a charger. On paper, the answer should be simple \u2014 Nothing\u2019s budget option claims that it supports up to 33W wired charging to get you back on your feet. That should be enough to beat the Moto G 5G by nearly 15W and the Galaxy A15 by about 8W at top speeds.\nIn practice, though, the performance isn\u2019t nearly as close as the numbers suggest. I set the CMF Phone 1 up on my trusty Ugreen Nexode Pro \u2014 one of the best chargers I\u2019ve used \u2014 and found that even though it spent most of its time at around 27W, it was able to finish charging a full 20 minutes faster than the Galaxy A15 5G and thumped the Moto G 5G by about 40 minutes. Based on the graph, it looks like the CMF Phone 1 was able to maintain its peak charging speed for far longer than its competitors, holding pace for about 40 minutes before tailing off.\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s time to talk about the interchangeable elephant in the room \u2014 Nothing\u2019s poor US band support. Just like with the Phone 2a and 2a Plus, Nothing is upfront about the fact that the CMF Phone 1 is primarily available as part of a beta program. What that means, though, is that it has almost none of the bands needed for customers on Verizon and AT&T to use the phone effectively. T-Mobile customers are a little luckier, as the Phone 1 covers parts of the 3G, 4G, and 5G spectrum, but once again doesn\u2019t support the entire set of bands needed.\nAs a Verizon customer, that limited support turned my CMF Phone 1 into a fancy, customizable iPod Touch. I could use it while connected to Wi-Fi and stream downloaded music to a pair of CMF Buds Pro 2 that Nothing also sent over (which are quite good \u2014 check out our review from sister site SoundGuys at the link), but it meant that the Phone 1 couldn\u2019t bail me out if my Pixel 9 Pro died while away from a charger. So, unless you\u2019re a T-Mobile customer in a well-supported area of the US, you will have a tough time with this one.\nIf you\u2019re outside of the US, though, the CMF Phone 1 has the performance chops (and band support) to compete with Android phones both at and slightly above its price point.\nIs one decent camera enough?\nMoving on to yet another area where cheaper phones tend to struggle, it\u2019s time to talk about the CMF Phone 1\u2019s budget cameras \u2014 er, camera. Yes, I know that there are technically two sensors on the back of this plastic beast, but we only really have to dig into one because the other is a lowly 2MP depth sensor with a maximum aperture of f/2.4. It only provides additional data and light for its more capable partner, so let\u2019s turn our focus (pun intended) to that slightly more useful sensor.\nNothing's 50MP camera is decent at its default zoom, but not very good otherwise.\nSaid primary sensor is a 50MP that comes from Sony and packs the CMF Phone 1 with a portrait-ready maximum aperture of f/1.8. Nothing is a little light on the other details about its primary camera, at least regarding sensor size and specific branding, though it does tout Ultra XDR support and AI Vivid modes thanks to its Truelens Engine 2.0. Unsurprisingly, there is not much else to say about the Phone 1\u2019s basic camera setup, so let\u2019s get to a few sample images.\nTypically, when I put together a gallery of sample images for a phone, I\u2019m only looking for the best ones. I usually snap away for the entire time I have a device and come away with plenty of shots I like. This time, though, I missed more shots than I hit \u2014 especially in low light. As much as I\u2019m pleased with the look at the rainforest section of the Baltimore Aquarium after dark, I\u2019m thoroughly disappointed by the shot of the musician in the bottom row, which was taken no more than five minutes earlier. I thought I held pretty still while snapping it, yet the text on the wall behind him is blurred, as is a bit of his hair.\nFor the most part, though, those misses are balanced out by the neat colors in the wider view of the main aquarium tank and the view of Independence Hall. Both show decent details throughout, with the shot of Independence Hall looking particularly crisp. The portrait mode shot of Ben Franklin isn\u2019t bad either, as it accurately identifies the edges of his colonial suit and hair. Of course, the lesson here is that you can get some pretty good views out of the CMF Phone 1 as long as you\u2019re willing to be a little bit patient \u2014 something that\u2019s true of most budget phones.\nUnfortunately, the CMF Phone 1\u2019s larger camera struggles come when you try to zoom. The lack of an ultrawide camera or a telephoto sensor means that the quality drops off quickly once you move away from 1x zoom. Nothing\u2019s lone sensor tops out at 10x zoom, which seems a bit too far, given the way that the shot of the sailboat and the seagull above turned out. Everything about the shot of the boat is a bit blurry, making it challenging to tell where the top of the ship ends and the dock begins. Granted, the seagull is a little better \u2014 you can at least pick out the bricks in the background \u2014but the bird itself looks closer to gray than mostly white. If you\u2019re willing to stick between about 1x and 4x zoom, though, Nothing\u2019s lone sensor can hold its own in good lighting.\nSurprisingly, the best camera on the CMF Phone 1 might be its 16MP selfie shooter. It\u2019s not going to give the sensors on the Pixel 9 or iPhone 16 a run for their money, but it handled the colors and textures in my sweatshirt nicely, with only slight ghosting around the white lettering. I\u2019m decently impressed by how it picked out the edges of my hair, too, as some cheap Android phones tend to cut curls off both sides of my head.\nFor video recording, the CMF Phone 1 supports quality up to 4K resolution at 30 frames per second or 1080p at up to 60fps, both of which are fine for this price tier. Nothing\u2019s electronic image stabilization is decent, though you\u2019ll have to stay at 1x zoom, as anything further has the same quality struggle as the still images above.\nCMF Phone 1 review verdict: A bold, fun budget phone, but not one for the US\nAt the end of the day, I really, really like the idea behind the CMF Phone 1, especially at its very competitive price point. I enjoy swapping the accessories in and out and knowing that the hardware screws will keep them locked securely in place. I also appreciate the power the Dimensity 7300 brings to the table, especially against other budget phones. Nothing\u2019s 33W wired charging setup is good, too, getting the CMF Phone 1 back on its feet quickly compared to affordable Android phones from Samsung and Motorola. Nothing OS is also an incredibly trendy, lean skin, too, which is a breath of fresh air when so many cheaper phones are stacked with bloatware.\nThere are some budget phone concessions you have to deal with, though. Its lone 50MP camera has the potential to be really good, but you have to keep it incredibly stable in low light. Once you get comfortable with some of the camera quirks like that, though, you might find that one camera is all you need. I\u2019ve nicked Nothing\u2019s plastic frame by dropping the Phone 1 on a bed of leaves, and the plastic back is hard enough to swap out that I\u2019m having trouble hiding my unhappy accident. Two years of Android updates and a third year of security patches doesn\u2019t quite match the Galaxy A15 5G in terms of long-term support, but it is acceptable for a phone at this price tier in the US.\nThe CMF Phone 1 is a clever idea and a great budget phone for international buyers, but I hope Nothing starts to treat the US as more than a beta testing ground.\nThat, of course, brings me back to the kicker for the CMF Phone 1 \u2014 it\u2019s simply a non-starter here in the US. You can buy it as part of the same beta program that covers Nothing\u2019s Phone 2a (\u00a3319.99 at Amazon) and Nothing 2a Plus ($417.5 at Amazon), but it\u2019s hard to find proper support. The limited band setup means you\u2019ll only have access to part of T-Mobile\u2019s network, with radio silence coming from both Verizon and AT&T. Oh, and since you can\u2019t buy Nothing\u2019s colorful accessories stateside, you\u2019re essentially buying a budget phone with half of its intended experience.\nThe rest of the world is getting a fun little phone for an excellent price, but as much as I like the idea of the CMF Phone 1, if you\u2019re in the US like me, I think I\u2019ll have to steer you in another direction. Thankfully, the current state of the budget Android market stateside means that\u2019s pretty easy to do anyway, which hasn\u2019t always been the case. Depending on your budget, there are plenty of affordable Samsung Galaxy A devices to look at or Motorola Moto G options to consider, you\u2019ll just have to decide what matters to you.\nPersonally, though, I think the Galaxy A15 5G ($178.66 at Amazon) is probably the best alternative, both for its longer software support and far more flexible triple camera setup. Yes, the CMF Phone 1 beats it from top to bottom in terms of performance, battery life, and charging, but sometimes, the best phone is the one you can use most readily. Samsung\u2019s offering also has NFC support, unlike the Phone 1.\nShould you decide to go Motorola, the Moto G 5G (2024) ($179.99 at Amazon) is the closest alternative. It\u2019s set up somewhere between the other two, pairing a pretty good 50MP primary camera with a 2MP macro sensor that constantly leaves me scratching my head. It\u2019s nicely dressed up with a vegan leather back panel in an eye-catching Sage finish, though, which is nice. Motorola\u2019s option is also the only one of the three to rock an LCD panel, but it\u2019s easily the most affordable of the bunch in case you\u2019re trying to live on a tight budget.\nOne day, when Nothing finally offers wider US distribution, I\u2019ll happily recommend the CMF Phone 1 (and the Phone 2a or 2a Plus) for budget Android fans over here, but we\u2019re just not quite there yet. For everyone else, this one is a steal.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
