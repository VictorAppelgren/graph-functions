      "text": "Monro (MNRO)\nWe wouldn\u2019t buy Monro. Its low returns on capital and plummeting sales suggest it struggles to generate demand and profits, a red flag.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Monro Will Underperform\nStarted as a single location in Rochester, New York, Monro (NASDAQ:MNRO) provides common auto services such as brake repairs, tire replacements, and oil changes.\n- Below-average returns on capital indicate management struggled to find compelling investment opportunities, and its decreasing returns suggest its historical profit centers are aging\n- Subscale operations are evident in its revenue base of $1.20 billion, meaning it has fewer distribution channels than its larger rivals\n- Earnings per share have contracted by 19.5% annually over the last five years, a headwind for returns as stock prices often echo long-term EPS performance\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Monro\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Monro\nAt $15.28 per share, Monro trades at 21.7x forward P/E. This multiple expensive for its subpar fundamentals.\nWe\u2019d rather pay up for companies with elite fundamentals than get a decent price on a poor one. High-quality businesses often have more durable earnings power, helping us sleep well at night.\n3. Monro (MNRO) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nAuto services provider Monro (NASDAQ:MNRO) beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 2.7% year on year to $301 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.22 per share was 48.6% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nMonro (MNRO) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $301 million vs analyst estimates of $296.1 million (2.7% year-on-year growth, 1.7% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.22 vs analyst estimates of $0.15 (7c beat)\n- Operating Margin: -2%, down from 4.5% in the same quarter last year\n- Same-Store Sales rose 5.7% year on year (-9.9% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $489.1 million\nCompany Overview\nStarted as a single location in Rochester, New York, Monro (NASDAQ:MNRO) provides common auto services such as brake repairs, tire replacements, and oil changes.\nThe core customer is someone who relies on their cars for daily needs, which is most of suburban and rural America. Monro understands that these car owners have busy lives and may lack the expertise to diagnose and address issues with their automobiles. The company therefore aims to be a one-stop-shop for everything from periodic maintenance to more involved repairs.\nMonro locations are moderate in size, typically 5,000 square feet and equipped with specialty tools and technology for auto repairs. These locations are strategically located in suburban areas, close to residential neighborhoods and major roadways. Even though you can\u2019t have your car fixed online, Monro does have an e-commerce presence where customers can schedule appointments, access information Monro\u2019s services, and even purchase products like tires and motor oil.\n4. Auto Parts Retailer\nCars are complex machines that need maintenance and occasional repairs, and auto parts retailers cater to the professional mechanic as well as the do-it-yourself (DIY) fixer. Work on cars may entail replacing fluids, parts, or accessories, and these stores have the parts and accessories or these jobs. While e-commerce competition presents a risk, these stores have a leg up due to the combination of broad and deep selection as well as expertise provided by sales associates. Another change on the horizon could be the increasing penetration of electric vehicles.\nAuto parts and services providers include Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP), AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), O\u2019Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY), and private company Pep Boys.\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years.\nWith $1.20 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Monro is a small retailer, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and negotiating leverage with suppliers.\nAs you can see below, Monro struggled to increase demand as its $1.20 billion of sales for the trailing 12 months was close to its revenue six years ago (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts). This was mainly because it closed stores and observed lower sales at existing, established locations.\nThis quarter, Monro reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 2.7% but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.7%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 1.4% over the next 12 months, similar to its six-year rate. This projection is underwhelming and suggests its products will face some demand challenges.\n6. Store Performance\nNumber of Stores\nA retailer\u2019s store count influences how much it can sell and how quickly revenue can grow.\nOver the last two years, Monro has generally closed its stores, averaging 1.2% annual declines.\nWhen a retailer shutters stores, it usually means that brick-and-mortar demand is less than supply, and it is responding by closing underperforming locations to improve profitability.\nNote that Monro reports its store count intermittently, so some data points are missing in the chart below.\nSame-Store Sales\nThe change in a company's store base only tells one side of the story. The other is the performance of its existing locations and e-commerce sales, which informs management teams whether they should expand or downsize their physical footprints. Same-store sales is an industry measure of whether revenue is growing at those existing stores and is driven by customer visits (often called traffic) and the average spending per customer (ticket).\nMonro\u2019s demand has been shrinking over the last two years as its same-store sales have averaged 2.6% annual declines. This performance isn\u2019t ideal, and Monro is attempting to boost same-store sales by closing stores (fewer locations sometimes lead to higher same-store sales).\nIn the latest quarter, Monro\u2019s same-store sales rose 5.7% year on year. This growth was a well-appreciated turnaround from its historical levels, showing the business is regaining momentum.\n7. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nMonro\u2019s unit economics are higher than the typical retailer, giving it the flexibility to invest in areas such as marketing and talent to reach more consumers. As you can see below, it averaged a decent 35.2% gross margin over the last two years. Said differently, Monro paid its suppliers $64.75 for every $100 in revenue.\nThis quarter, Monro\u2019s gross profit margin was 35.5%, down 1.7 percentage points year on year but still exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates by 1.3%. Monro\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 1.4 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to discount products and higher input costs (such as labor and freight expenses to transport goods).\n8. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nMonro was profitable over the last two years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 2.5% was weak for a consumer retail business.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Monro\u2019s operating margin decreased by 6 percentage points over the last year. Monro\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nThis quarter, Monro generated an operating margin profit margin of negative 2%, down 6.5 percentage points year on year. Since Monro\u2019s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was less efficient because expenses such as marketing, and administrative overhead increased.\n9. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nMonro\u2019s full-year EPS dropped 144%, or 19.5% annually, over the last five years. In a mature sector such as consumer retail, we tend to steer our readers away from companies with falling EPS because it could imply changing secular trends and preferences. If the tide turns unexpectedly, Monro\u2019s low margin of safety could leave its stock price susceptible to large downswings.\nIn Q2, Monro reported EPS at $0.22, in line with the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Monro\u2019s full-year EPS of $0.49 to grow 44.3%.\n10. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nMonro has shown robust cash profitability, giving it an edge over its competitors and the ability to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 6.6% over the last two years, quite impressive for a consumer retail business. The divergence from its underwhelming operating margin stems from the add-back of non-cash charges like depreciation and stock-based compensation. GAAP operating profit expenses these line items, but free cash flow does not.\n11. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nMonro historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 5.1%, somewhat low compared to the best consumer retail companies that consistently pump out 25%+.\n12. Balance Sheet Assessment\nMonro reported $7.80 million of cash and $524.9 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $106.9 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Monro\u2019s 4.8\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $18.56 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n13. Key Takeaways from Monro\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Monro blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock traded up 1% to $16.50 immediately after reporting.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy Monro?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 10:29 PM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy Monro or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nWe see the value of companies helping consumers, but in the case of Monro, we\u2019re out. For starters, its revenue has declined over the last six years, and analysts don\u2019t see anything changing over the next 12 months. And while its projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities. On top of that, its shrinking same-store sales tell us it will need to change its strategy to succeed.\nMonro\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 22.1x. This multiple tells us a lot of good news is priced in - we think there are better stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $15.67 on the company (compared to the current share price of $15.70)."

Not only are its sales cratering but also its low returns on capital suggest it struggles to generate profits.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Advance Auto Parts Will Underperform\nFounded in Virginia in 1932, Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) is an auto parts and accessories retailer that sells everything from carburetors to motor oil to car floor mats.\n- Persistent operating margin losses and eroding margin over the last year point to growing market pressures and a poorly managed expense base\n- Below-average returns on capital indicate management struggled to find compelling investment opportunities, and its decreasing returns suggest its historical profit centers are aging\n- Depletion of cash reserves could lead to a fundraising event that triggers shareholder dilution\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Advance Auto Parts\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Advance Auto Parts\nAdvance Auto Parts\u2019s stock price of $59.36 implies a valuation ratio of 27.7x forward P/E. This multiple rich for the business quality. Not a great combination.\nIt\u2019s better to pay up for high-quality businesses with strong long-term earnings potential rather than to buy lower-quality companies with open questions and big downside risks.\n3. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) Research Report: Q1 CY2025 Update\nAuto parts and accessories retailer Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) reported Q1 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations, but sales fell by 6.8% year on year to $2.58 billion. The company expects the full year\u2019s revenue to be around $8.5 billion, close to analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.22 per share was 68% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nAdvance Auto Parts (AAP) Q1 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $2.58 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.50 billion (6.8% year-on-year decline, 3.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: -$0.22 vs analyst estimates of -$0.69 (68% beat)\n- The company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $8.5 billion at the midpoint\n- Management reiterated its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance of $2 at the midpoint\n- Operating Margin: -5.1%, down from 1.9% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was -$198 million compared to -$46.27 million in the same quarter last year\n- Locations: 4,285 at quarter end, down from 4,777 in the same quarter last year\n- Same-Store Sales were flat year on year, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $1.87 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in Virginia in 1932, Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) is an auto parts and accessories retailer that sells everything from carburetors to motor oil to car floor mats.\nThe company serves both do-it-yourself (DIY) customers as well as professional mechanics and auto repair businesses. The company understands that DIY customers may have varying levels of expertise in auto repair, so stores feature automotive expert sales associates who can help you find which brake pads will fit your 2019 Ford Focus, for example.\nFor the professional mechanic, Advance Auto Parts has a particularly strong selection of commercial products such as heavy-duty truck parts. The company also offers a commercial program with dedicated account managers, customized billing options, and professional-grade tools for rent. A fleet of commercial delivery vehicles thousands strong make sure professional customers get what they need in a timely manner.\nAdvance Auto Parts stores are typically located in smaller towns and more rural areas compared to auto parts peers, with a strong footprint in the Eastern US. The typical store is roughly 7,500 square feet, with many featuring areas and help desks specifically for professional customers. In addition to its brick-and-mortar stores, Advance Auto Parts also has an e-commerce presence that allows customers to buy products to be shipped to their homes or to buy and pick up at the nearest store to save time.\n4. Auto Parts Retailer\nCars are complex machines that need maintenance and occasional repairs, and auto parts retailers cater to the professional mechanic as well as the do-it-yourself (DIY) fixer. Work on cars may entail replacing fluids, parts, or accessories, and these stores have the parts and accessories or these jobs. While e-commerce competition presents a risk, these stores have a leg up due to the combination of broad and deep selection as well as expertise provided by sales associates. Another change on the horizon could be the increasing penetration of electric vehicles.\nCompetitors offering auto parts and accessories include AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), O\u2019Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY), Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC), and private company Pep Boys.\n5. Sales Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years.\nWith $8.90 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Advance Auto Parts is a mid-sized retailer, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from better economies of scale.\nAs you can see below, Advance Auto Parts\u2019s revenue declined by 1.3% per year over the last six years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts) as it closed stores.\nThis quarter, Advance Auto Parts\u2019s revenue fell by 6.8% year on year to $2.58 billion but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 3.2%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 4.6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last six years. This projection is underwhelming and suggests its products will see some demand headwinds.\n6. Store Performance\nNumber of Stores\nThe number of stores a retailer operates is a critical driver of how quickly company-level sales can grow.\nAdvance Auto Parts listed 4,285 locations in the latest quarter and has generally closed its stores over the last two years, averaging 3.4% annual declines.\nWhen a retailer shutters stores, it usually means that brick-and-mortar demand is less than supply, and it is responding by closing underperforming locations to improve profitability.\nSame-Store Sales\nThe change in a company's store base only tells one side of the story. The other is the performance of its existing locations and e-commerce sales, which informs management teams whether they should expand or downsize their physical footprints. Same-store sales provides a deeper understanding of this issue because it measures organic growth at brick-and-mortar shops for at least a year.\nAdvance Auto Parts\u2019s demand within its existing locations has barely increased over the last two years as its same-store sales were flat. This performance isn\u2019t ideal, and Advance Auto Parts is attempting to boost same-store sales by closing stores (fewer locations sometimes lead to higher same-store sales).\nIn the latest quarter, Advance Auto Parts\u2019s year on year same-store sales were flat. This performance was more or less in line with its historical levels.\n7. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nAt StockStory, we prefer high gross margin businesses because they indicate pricing power or differentiated products, giving the company a chance to generate higher operating profits.\nAdvance Auto Parts\u2019s unit economics are higher than the typical retailer, giving it the flexibility to invest in areas such as marketing and talent to reach more consumers. As you can see below, it averaged a decent 35.8% gross margin over the last two years. Said differently, Advance Auto Parts paid its suppliers $64.19 for every $100 in revenue.\nAdvance Auto Parts\u2019s gross profit margin came in at 42.9% this quarter, up 14.2 percentage points year on year and exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates by 4.1%. Advance Auto Parts\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending up over the past 12 months, increasing by 4.8 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest the company has less pressure to discount products and is realizing better unit economics due to stable or shrinking input costs (such as labor and freight expenses to transport goods).\n8. Operating Margin\nDespite the consumer retail industry\u2019s secular decline, unprofitable public companies are few and far between. Unfortunately, Advance Auto Parts was one of them over the last two years as its high expenses contributed to an average operating margin of negative 4.8%.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Advance Auto Parts\u2019s operating margin decreased by 10.4 percentage points over the last year. Advance Auto Parts\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nAdvance Auto Parts\u2019s operating margin was negative 5.1% this quarter. The company's consistent lack of profits raise a flag.\n9. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nAdvance Auto Parts\u2019s full-year EPS turned negative over the last five years. In a mature sector such as consumer retail, we tend to steer our readers away from companies with falling EPS because it could imply changing secular trends and preferences. If the tide turns unexpectedly, Advance Auto Parts\u2019s low margin of safety could leave its stock price susceptible to large downswings.\nIn Q1, Advance Auto Parts reported EPS at negative $0.22, down from $0.67 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts forecast Advance Auto Parts\u2019s full-year EPS of negative $0.69 will flip to positive $2.14.\n10. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nAdvance Auto Parts has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 1.3%, subpar for a consumer retail business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Advance Auto Parts\u2019s margin dropped by 8 percentage points over the last year. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its already low cash conversion. If the trend continues, it could signal it\u2019s in the middle of a big investment cycle.\nAdvance Auto Parts burned through $198 million of cash in Q1, equivalent to a negative 7.7% margin. The company\u2019s cash burn increased from $46.27 million of lost cash in the same quarter last year. These numbers deviate from its longer-term margin, indicating it is a seasonal business that must build up inventory during certain quarters.\n11. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAdvance Auto Parts historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 2.6%, lower than the typical cost of capital (how much it costs to raise money) for consumer retail companies.\n12. Balance Sheet Risk\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nAdvance Auto Parts burned through $247.9 million of cash over the last year, and its $3.67 billion of debt exceeds the $1.67 billion of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble.\nUnless the Advance Auto Parts\u2019s fundamentals change quickly, it might find itself in a position where it must raise capital from investors to continue operating. Whether that would be favorable is unclear because dilution is a headwind for shareholder returns.\nWe remain cautious of Advance Auto Parts until it generates consistent free cash flow or any of its announced financing plans materialize on its balance sheet.\n13. Key Takeaways from Advance Auto Parts\u2019s Q1 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Advance Auto Parts blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year EPS guidance trumped Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, we think this was a very solid quarter with some key areas of upside, especially amid fears of economic weakness and tariff headwinds. The stock traded up 22.3% to $38.25 immediately following the results.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy Advance Auto Parts?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 10:40 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Advance Auto Parts.\nAdvance Auto Parts doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. To begin with, its revenue has declined over the last six years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities. On top of that, its operating margins reveal poor profitability compared to other retailers.\nAdvance Auto Parts\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 27.6x. This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - we think there are better opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $49.25 on the company (compared to the current share price of $59.29), implying they don\u2019t see much short-term potential in Advance Auto Parts."

      "text": "Genuine Parts (GPC)\nGenuine Parts doesn\u2019t excite us. Its sales have underperformed and its low returns on capital show it has few growth opportunities.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Genuine Parts Will Underperform\nLargely targeting the professional customer, Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) sells auto and industrial parts such as batteries, belts, bearings, and machine fluids.\n- Large revenue base makes it harder to increase sales quickly, and its annual revenue growth of 4.7% over the last six years was below our standards for the consumer retail sector\n- Operating margin fell from an already low starting point over the last year, and the smaller profit dollars make it harder to react to unexpected market developments\n- Rapid rollout of new stores raises questions since current locations haven\u2019t demonstrated acceptable same-store sales growth\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Genuine Parts\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Genuine Parts\nGenuine Parts is trading at $133.40 per share, or 16.4x forward P/E. While valuation is appropriate for the quality you get, we\u2019re still on the sidelines for now.\nWe prefer to invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with superior earnings growth.\n3. Genuine Parts (GPC) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nAuto and industrial parts retailer Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 3.4% year on year to $6.16 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $2.10 per share was 2.1% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nGenuine Parts (GPC) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $6.16 billion vs analyst estimates of $6.11 billion (3.4% year-on-year growth, 0.9% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $2.10 vs analyst estimates of $2.06 (2.1% beat)\n- Management lowered its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $7.75 at the midpoint, a 3.1% decrease\n- Operating Margin: 9%, up from 6.7% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 1.3%, down from 2.5% in the same quarter last year\n- Same-Store Sales were flat year on year (-0.9% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $17.19 billion\nCompany Overview\nLargely targeting the professional customer, Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) sells auto and industrial parts such as batteries, belts, bearings, and machine fluids.\nThese customers include mechanics, maintenance technicians, and other industrial service professionals. However, some brands carried by Genuine Parts, such as NAPA Auto Parts cater to do-it-yourself (DIY) customers. This brand\u2019s wide range of auto parts and accessories means that the \u2018average Joe\u2019 can find products he can work with, especially since Genuine Parts stores are staffed with knowledgeable associates willing to help any customer.\nAside from the well-known NAPA brand, Genuine Parts carries other trusted auto parts brands such as ACDelco, Bosch, and Gates. These names offer everything from spark plugs to carburetors in auto. With regards to industrial products, the company carries power transmission, electrical, and wiring products from brands such as 3M, Motion Industries, Wagner, EIS, and Inenco.\nGenuine Parts stores range from 2,500 to 12,500 square feet depending on the location. These stores can be found in urban and suburban areas, often strategically placed in proximity of auto body shops and industrial parks where customers may operate. In addition to the store footprint, Genuine Parts has an e-commerce presence, launched in 1999, where customers can search and purchase products online, with options for in-store pickup or delivery.\n4. Auto Parts Retailer\nCars are complex machines that need maintenance and occasional repairs, and auto parts retailers cater to the professional mechanic as well as the do-it-yourself (DIY) fixer. Work on cars may entail replacing fluids, parts, or accessories, and these stores have the parts and accessories or these jobs. While e-commerce competition presents a risk, these stores have a leg up due to the combination of broad and deep selection as well as expertise provided by sales associates. Another change on the horizon could be the increasing penetration of electric vehicles.\nCompetitors offering auto and/or industrial parts include Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP), AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), Grainger (NYSE:GWW), and Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST).\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years.\nWith $23.77 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Genuine Parts is one of the larger companies in the consumer retail industry and benefits from a well-known brand that influences purchasing decisions. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because it\u2019s harder to find incremental growth when you\u2019ve penetrated most of the market. For Genuine Parts to boost its sales, it likely needs to adjust its prices or lean into foreign markets.\nAs you can see below, Genuine Parts\u2019s sales grew at a sluggish 4.7% compounded annual growth rate over the last six years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts).\nThis quarter, Genuine Parts reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 3.4% but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 0.9%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.3% over the next 12 months, similar to its six-year rate. We still think its growth trajectory is satisfactory given its scale and indicates the market is baking in success for its products.\n6. Store Performance\nNumber of Stores\nA retailer\u2019s store count often determines how much revenue it can generate.\nGenuine Parts opened new stores at a rapid clip over the last two years, averaging 5.6% annual growth, much faster than the broader consumer retail sector.\nWhen a retailer opens new stores, it usually means it\u2019s investing for growth because demand is greater than supply, especially in areas where consumers may not have a store within reasonable driving distance.\nNote that Genuine Parts reports its store count intermittently, so some data points are missing in the chart below.\nSame-Store Sales\nThe change in a company's store base only tells one side of the story. The other is the performance of its existing locations and e-commerce sales, which informs management teams whether they should expand or downsize their physical footprints. Same-store sales is an industry measure of whether revenue is growing at those existing stores and is driven by customer visits (often called traffic) and the average spending per customer (ticket).\nGenuine Parts\u2019s demand within its existing locations has barely increased over the last two years as its same-store sales were flat. Genuine Parts should consider improving its foot traffic and efficiency before expanding its store base.\nIn the latest quarter, Genuine Parts\u2019s year on year same-store sales were flat. This performance was more or less in line with its historical levels.\n7. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nWe prefer higher gross margins because they not only make it easier to generate more operating profits but also indicate product differentiation, negotiating leverage, and pricing power.\nGenuine Parts\u2019s unit economics are higher than the typical retailer, giving it the flexibility to invest in areas such as marketing and talent to reach more consumers. As you can see below, it averaged a decent 36.6% gross margin over the last two years. Said differently, Genuine Parts paid its suppliers $63.39 for every $100 in revenue.\nGenuine Parts produced a 37.7% gross profit margin in Q2, up 1 percentage points year on year and exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates by 2%. Zooming out, the company\u2019s full-year margin has remained steady over the past 12 months, suggesting it strives to keep prices low for customers and has stable input costs (such as labor and freight expenses to transport goods).\n8. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income - the bottom line - excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\nGenuine Parts was profitable over the last two years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 6.3% was weak for a consumer retail business.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Genuine Parts\u2019s operating margin decreased by 1.2 percentage points over the last year. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Genuine Parts\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nIn Q2, Genuine Parts generated an operating margin profit margin of 9%, up 2.3 percentage points year on year. The increase was encouraging, and because its operating margin rose more than its gross margin, we can infer it was more efficient with expenses such as marketing, and administrative overhead.\n9. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nGenuine Parts\u2019s unimpressive 4.4% annual EPS growth over the last six years aligns with its revenue performance. On the bright side, this tells us its incremental sales were profitable.\nIn Q2, Genuine Parts reported EPS at $2.10, down from $2.44 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 2.1%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Genuine Parts\u2019s full-year EPS of $7.34 to grow 10.9%.\n10. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nGenuine Parts has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 2.7% over the last two years, slightly better than the broader consumer retail sector.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Genuine Parts\u2019s margin dropped by 3.4 percentage points over the last year. This decrease came from the higher costs associated with opening more stores.\nGenuine Parts\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $80.96 million in Q2, equivalent to a 1.3% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 1.2 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, suggesting its historical struggles have dragged on.\n11. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nGenuine Parts historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 14.3%, somewhat low compared to the best consumer retail companies that consistently pump out 25%+.\n12. Balance Sheet Assessment\nGenuine Parts reported $458 million of cash and $6.42 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $2.06 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Genuine Parts\u2019s 2.9\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $54.22 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n13. Key Takeaways from Genuine Parts\u2019s Q2 Results\nWhile revenue and EPS beat by a bit, full-year EPS guidance was lowered due to \"challenging market conditions\", which is a big negative. The stock traded down 3.1% to $120.02 immediately after reporting.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy Genuine Parts?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 10:43 PM EDT\nBefore making an investment decision, investors should account for Genuine Parts\u2019s business fundamentals and valuation in addition to what happened in the latest quarter.\nGenuine Parts isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it doesn\u2019t pass our bar. To kick things off, its revenue growth was a little slower over the last six years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its new store openings have increased its brand equity, the downside is its poor same-store sales performance has been a headwind. On top of that, its operating margins are low compared to other retailers.\nGenuine Parts\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 16.6x. Investors with a higher risk tolerance might like the company, but we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $138.22 on the company (compared to the current share price of $134.76)."
