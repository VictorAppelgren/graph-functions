      "feedback": "The draft has a solid multi‑year frame and credible tie‑ins to policy and crypto dynamics, but to reach world‑class quality you should re‑structure and elevate the explicit causality, anchors, and quantitative discipline. Edit plan: (1) Reframe into a clean horizon structure: Base Case (multi‑year structural regime), with explicit upside/downside regime transitions and their triggers; add a concise “Base Case, Key Risks, What to Watch, Confidence” section as the terminus. (2) Embed first‑principles anchors and invariant channels drawn from the sources, e.g., Fed framework (2% target, flexible average inflation targeting) and the implied neutral real rate regime; specify how real rate differentials, expected inflation path, and the policy reaction function anchor the long‑horizon regime and the BoP/terms‑of‑trade/ productivity channels that feed asset pricing. (3) Formalize the causal chain: policy stance and inflation trajectory → cost of capital/discount rate for risk assets (including crypto) → ETF/institutional inflows and corporate treasuries → crypto price discovery and volatility spillovers; connect to the Bitmine/ETH‑ETF/Project Crypto GENIUS/Trump retirement‑plan moves as concrete transmission nodes (cite OGK8WLL69). (4) Make the medium‑term case concrete with catalysts/triggers and clear invalidation conditions: Powell’s Jackson Hole guidance and rate‑cut timing as a trigger; tariff/shock regimes; regulatory developments (GENIUS Act, Project Crypto) as accelerants or brakes; add a single invalidation scenario (hawkish shift or regulatory reversal) with price and flow implications. (5) Quantify with discipline: extract explicit numbers from sources and use them to bound paths, e.g., ETH highs around 4,955 dollars and BTC around 124k (and near‑term moves to 110k–120k ranges); note Bitmine’s $45 million purchase as a demonstration of treasury demand; cite ETH ETF inflows and stablecoin activity as anchors for long‑horizon demand; avoid vague adjectives and provide ranges tied to scenarios rather than statements like “essential.” (6) Strengthen alignment with SECTION FOCUS by naming the two or three invariant macro channels you rely on (policy credibility, rate path, institutional crypto demand) and show how each regime shifts those channels; (7) tighten the narrative around the Ford/Govt/UBI elements: treat NL5YYTLF2 and 22PL3Q360 as cross‑checks on macro risk and cyclicality rather than as side notes; reconcile any conflicts by presenting both sides with conditional probability and noting where data is weak. (8) Improve citation discipline: attach each substantive claim to one of the IDs you intend to rely on (OGK8WLL69 for crypto/ Powell, NL5YYTLF2 for identity/UBI psychology context, 22PL3Q360 for cyclicity/macro risk in autos, 2QRLB974F and 1GVYF2V8O for Kevin O’Leary points) and ensure no statements about these topics are made without a corresponding source. (9) Reduce over‑reach and ensure the prose stays compact; if you keep the current sentences, prune redundancy (e.g., duplicate mentions of “institutional demand”) and move from narrative assertions to a concise, evidence‑backed matrix of regime states with probabilistic flavor. (10) After edits, run a final consistency check to ensure every numbered assertion has a source ID and every numeric claim aligns with the numbers in OGK8WLL69, NL5YYTLF2, 22PL3Q360, and the Kevin O’Leary pieces (1GVYF2V8O, 2QRLB974F). This will convert the piece from a thematically coherent draft to a rigorously sourced, world‑class, multi‑year macro view.",
