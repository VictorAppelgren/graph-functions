  "description": "HALIFAX \u2014 A gold mine in eastern Nova Scotia received its final permit approval from the provincial government on Wednesday, seven years after the project was first\u2026",
  "content": "Goldboro\u2019s approval comes after the government announced in June it would accelerate the environmental review process for mining and other resource projects. Premier Tim Houston said at the time he wanted to accelerate resource development to boost the province\u2019s economy during the trade war with the United States.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve relaxed any terms and conditions, this approval contains \u2026 conditions that are informed by the eight years of science, study and consultation that predated this work,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nHe confirmed that the company has a site reclamation bond of $41 million \u2014 to be used to restore the land once mining ends \u2014 that is required to be updated every three years to ensure that \u201cit continues to be sufficient into the future.\u201d\n\nOfficials say the mine is expected to generate about $528 million in tax revenue over 15 years and create 230 on-site jobs as well as hundreds of spinoff jobs. They said the company is also to pay an annual royalty to the province of one per cent of its net revenue.\n\nThe company, which is now waiting on federal environmental approval, has benefits agreements with the Municipality of the District of Guysborough and the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi\u2019kmaw Chiefs, although details of those agreements were not released Wednesday.\n\nKevin Bullock, NexGold\u2019s CEO and president, said the company expects to get federal approval within the next 90 days, adding that project financing will then have to be secured before work can begin by mid to late next year.\n\nHe said the $1.7-billion estimate for the mine is a few years old, and the actual cost will likely be higher once work gets underway.",
