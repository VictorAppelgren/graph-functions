      "feedback": "The draft omits explicit dxy mapping and magnitude ranges, mis‑attributes probabilities, and repeats the same probability source for two distinct downside scenarios. Rewrite each line to include “dxy” in the driver/mechanism, state a 0.3‑0.5 % upside or 0.2‑0.4 % downside range, and cite the correct source for each probability (88 % from 7XH2DKEKV for the Fed cut, 70 % from XTQIQRP5K for tariff‑risk, 10 % from U21K4ALYQ for Fed hike, and 10 % from U21K4ALYQ for tariff rollback/Ukraine de‑escalation). Ensure each line remains a single sentence, keeps the canonical handle (dxy) in the driver, and uses distinct catalysts (Fed minutes, July CPI, tariff announcements, Ukraine updates). This will satisfy the handle‑mapping, catalyst‑window, and probability‑justification requirements.",
