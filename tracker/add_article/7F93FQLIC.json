      "summary": "The Asia‑Pacific Mivan construction market is projected to grow from USD 1.09 billion in 2024 to USD 2.18 billion by 2030, driven by rapid urbanisation, demand for efficient housing, and adoption of aluminium formwork technology. Mivan’s speed, quality and cost‑efficiency appeal to large‑scale projects in India, China and Southeast Asia, though high upfront costs limit uptake by smaller contractors. Government initiatives such as India’s Housing for All further boost adoption by cutting project timelines up to 30%.",
