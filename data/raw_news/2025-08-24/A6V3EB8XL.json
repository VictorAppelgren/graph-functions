  "description": "The GOP firebrand reportedly boasted about her polling numbers to a slim crowd",
  "content": "South Carolina Republican. Rep. Nancy Mace cancelled a speech in her home state after only a small crowd decided to show up, according to a report.\n\nEvent organizers had urged people to RSVP in advance to hear Mace discuss \u201cprotecting parental rights\u201d at an event hosted by far-right group Moms for Liberty in Horry County on Thursday, warning that \u201cseating is limited.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t appear to be a problem.\n\nWhen the event kicked off, just eight people were in the room, My Horry News reported.\n\nThe gubernatorial candidate didn\u2019t take the stage to deliver remarks, but a member of Mace\u2019s team emerged, chatted with the event organizer, and told reporters that Mace would take their questions and then meet with the attendees individually, the outlet reported.\n\nAt least 100 people were expected to attend, according to the outlet.\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from a spokesperson for Mace.\n\nDespite the low turnout, the congresswoman boasted to reporters about how she was dominating the polls in South Carolina\u2019s race for governor, ABC News 4 reported. She announced her run earlier this month.\n\n\u201cHorry County makes presidents. Horry County elected Donald Trump, and they\u2019re a big part of the state,\u201d Mace said at the event. \u201cWe're winning by double digits everywhere, but particularly with folks who support the president.\u201d\n\nLast month, before she launched her campaign, a survey by South Carolina Policy Council found that Mace led with 16 percent of GOP-identifying voters.\n\nMore recently, her team published findings from a poll, conducted this month among 600 Republican voters, that shows Mace leading the five-way contest with 25 percent.\n\nThe poll found that 83 percent of respondents had heard of Mace. She has made recent headlines for her attacks on transgender Americans, including her colleague, Delaware Democratic Rep. Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of Congress.\n\nSouth Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and Rep. Ralph Norman are also running to lead the state.\n\nMace texted the results of the poll to Trump, My Horry News reported. The president then shared the results on his Truth Social account.\n\nAlthough she was once a vocal critic of the president following the Capitol attacks on January 6, 2021, the pair have since seemed to patch things up. Trump endorsed Mace for her 2024 re-election to Congress and Mace returned the favor by endorsing him for his 2024 presidential run. This month, she openly asked for his endorsement for governor, going so far as to describe herself as \u201cTrump in high heels.\u201d\n\n\"I'm just saying I've done a lot for the president, and if you talk to him, I would really like his support for governor,\" she said at an event earlier this month, ABC News reported.",

      "text": "How Nancy Mace went from being a \u2018caucus of one\u2019 to the lead anti-trans voice in Congress\nNancy Mace\u2019s turn from a swing-district mainstream Republican to a vocal anti-trans voice reveals just as much about the state of the GOP as it does her, Eric Garcia writes\nLast week, South Carolina Representative Nancy Mace made headlines when she introduced legislation that would ban transgender women from using women\u2019s restrooms on Capitol Hill. Mace, of course, did this in response to the election of Sarah McBride, who in January will become the first openly transgender member of Congress.\nMace\u2019s move was successful in two ways: House Speaker Mike Johnson agreed to ban trans people from using Capitol bathrooms that correspond to their sex assigned at birth \u2014 and the Republican lawmaker gained the notoriety that she clearly desired, even earning praise from Marjorie Taylor Greene, the right-wing firebrand with whom she regularly feuded during their first term in Congress.\nOn the surface, Mace going on the warpath against trans people may seem jolting, as she\u2019d once positioned herself as a different kind of Republican. In 2021, she\u2019d even insisted she was a supporter of LGBTQ rights, saying \u201cReligious Liberty, gay rights and transgender equality can all co-exist,\u201d as one of her former communications directors pointed out on X this month.\nWhen The Independent profiled her in early 2023, she called herself a \u201ccaucus of one.\u201d She mostly voted in line with other mainstream Republicans and voted to make Kevin McCarthy speaker at the beginning of 2023.\nThings changed later that year, when Mace joined some of the same obstructionists who had voted against McCarthy \u2014 an effort led by former Florida Representative Matt Gaetz \u2014 to oust the speaker. She gained further notoriety when during one meeting with House Republicans, she wore a giant red \u201cA\u201d emblazoned on her shirt.\nAll of these moves have allowed her to move up the ranks in the Republican Party. And it explains how the current Republican Party operates, rewarding controversial, headline-grabbing stunts over thoughtful policy.\nMace first won her seat in 2020, when Republicans significantly pared down Democrats\u2019 majority in the House. House Republican leader McCarthy \u2014 who once bemoaned that his party looked \u201clike the most restrictive country club in America\u201d \u2014 had aggressively recruited women and people of color to run in swing districts.\nAnd Mace had a quintessential American story. After being raped as a teenager, Mace dropped out of high school before she worked at a Waffle House, got her GED and became the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, a prestigious military academy.\nHer status as a single mother who was unafraid of a bit of trash talk made her seem like the kind of Republican who could lead the GOP beyond Trump, even though she had worked on his 2016 campaign. While she opposed Trump\u2019s impeachment after January 6, she did vocally criticize him.\nShe did not back away from picking fights with fringe figures like Greene. When Greene attacked her for supposedly being \u201cpro-abort\u201d \u2014 which Mace isn\u2019t except in the cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother \u2014 Mace said bless her f**king heart\u201d and called her a \u201creligious bigot.\u201d\nOn the policy side, she tried to find a middle way at times, introducing legislation to decriminalize cannabis. She voted with Democrats and a handful of Republicans to codify protections for same-sex and interracial married couples and to protect access to contraception.\nAfter Democrats did better in the 2022 midterm elections in part because of the anger about the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v Jackson decision, she warned that \u201cWe're not going to win hearts and minds over by being a**holes to women.\u201d\nBut Mace and other fresh-faced Republicans had one problem: The GOP did not want to move on beyond Trump. Ultimately, Trump did not exit the stage after January 6 and her policy proposals largely went nowhere.\nHe endorsed Mace\u2019s primary challenger in 2022, which famously led to her filming a selfie video in front of Trump Tower, which he proceeded to mock. She would survive, but it would teach her \u2014 and other Republicans \u2014 a lesson: The Republican Party was not interested in policymakers who could offer something different from Trump. Rather, it wanted more of the same.\nMace has since taken a rightward turn.\nThis can also explain the hard-right shift of some of the GOP\u2019s other female policymakers. Elise Stefanik, who previously worked for George W Bush and Paul Ryan, would go from being a moderate who voted against Trump\u2019s tax cuts in 2017 to being his most vocal defender during his impeachment trial.\nSenator Katie Britt of Alabama, a former chief of staff to Senator Richard Shelby who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and can bring home millions of dollars to her home state, gave her State of the Union response in a kitchen in a heavily affected and strained voice.\nAll three got behind Trump fairly early this time around. While more policy-oriented Republicans like Lisa Murkowski find themselves having to answer uncomfortable questions about Trump\u2019s latest cabinet pick, the lawmakers who glom onto social issues or grandstanding have been rewarded handsomely.\nBritt is now a regular in Republican circles. Stefanik will become Trump\u2019s US ambassador to the United Nations and Mace got to speak at the Republican National Convention.\nDemocrats, led by McBride, have responded by calling Mace\u2019s legislation as a \u201cdistraction.\u201d But anyone who has been to a conservative conference knows that if anything, conservatives see tax policy or the retirement age for Medicare as a distraction and banning trans women from sports and bathrooms as an animating policy alongside restricting immigration.\nPolitics is all about incentives. And as of right now, GOP politics rewards culture war crusaders.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

US politics Nancy Mace boasts about securing $195M in infrastructure funds. She voted against the law that made it possible South Carolina congresswoman voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which made the $195 million grant possible\nNancy Mace boasts about securing huge grant for South Carolina\nSign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email Get our free Inside Washington email Representative Nancy Mace has once again boasted about securing an infrastructure grant for her home state of South Carolina, despite voting against a bill that made the grant possible.\nMace, a right-wing lawmaker who is now running for governor in South Carolina , told the conservative network NewsMax2 on Wednesday that she \u201chelped secure the largest infrastructure grant in state history, in South Carolina history.\u201d\nLast year, Mace\u2019s state received $195 million to support the construction of a traffic interchange, marking the \u201clargest single grant award in the agency's history,\u201d the South Carolina Department of Transportation said . The federal grant was awarded through the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America program , which had \"historic levels of funding thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,\u201d the Transportation Department said.\nThat law, which was also known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was signed by former President Joe Biden in November 2021. Mace voted against it.\nWhile Mace voted against the law, she afterwards wrote a letter to former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg supporting the grant application.\nNancy Mace claimed she helped secure the 'largest infrastructure grant in [South Carolina] history.' While Mace advocated for the grant, she voted against a federal law that helped support it (Getty Images) Mace's communications director, Sydney Long, emphasized that the lawmaker helped secure the grant by writing the letter to Buttigieg and collaborating with state and local officials.\n\"While Congresswoman Mace has consistently raised concerns about reckless federal spending, she has always fought to ensure once federal dollars are allocated, South Carolina benefits,\" Long told The Independent . \"She has repeatedly emphasized South Carolina tax dollars matter just as much as anyone else\u2019s, and she works tirelessly to turn them into jobs and investment at home.\"\nMace made a nearly identical claim about securing the grant earlier this month at a town hall event.\n\u201cOne of the things the press will not tell you: I am one of the leading members of Congress who\u2019s gotten resources for our state,\u201d Mace said on August 6. \u201cIn fact, our office assisted in getting the largest infrastructure grant in South Carolina history, at $195 million earlier this year. The press won\u2019t tell you that.\u201d\nWhen asked by CNN how she could tout the grant despite voting against Biden\u2019s bill, Mace said it was her job to ensure the funds were appropriated.\n\u201cWe fight over how we spend the money, how we appropriate it, but once the appropriations happen, I\u2019m gonna make sure that South Carolina, that we get our fair share, because that money\u2019s getting spent and our tax dollars in South Carolina is equal to anybody else\u2019s in California, New York, Tennessee,\u201d Mace told CNN.\nMace also faced blowback online last year for making a similar claim.\n\u201cWe helped secure $195 million\u2014the largest grant in South Carolina's history from the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2014to kick off the Long Point Road Interchange Project,\u201d Mace wrote on X in October.\nMace\u2019s post was then hit with a community note clarifying she voted against the bill.\n\u201cRep. Nancy Mace voted against the infrastructure act that supplied this funding,\u201d the community note reads.\nMace made another post two days later, clarifying her claim: \"Of course we opposed the infrastructure package stuffed with trillions in partisan pork. But now that it's law, that money's getting spent whether we like it or not\u2014so you better believe we're making sure it gets reinvested right here in South Carolina.\"\nThis story was updated on August 21, 2025, to include comments from Sydney Long.\nThank you for registering Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

US politics Trump critic turned ally Nancy Mace announces run for South Carolina governor The right-wing Republican touts Trump\u2019s praise in her announcement ad and adopts the phase \u201cSouth Carolina First\u201d\nEric Garcia Washington, DC\nMonday 04 August 2025 17:42 BST\nNancy Mace says she loves watching videos of ICE ambushing immigrants in court\nSign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email Get our free Inside Washington email Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) \u2013 a former critic of President Donald Trump who became one of his most outspoken defenders on Capitol Hill while also becoming one of the most virulent voices against transgender people \u2013 announced she would is running to be governor of South Carolina.\nDespite having a thin legislative record, Mace has largely built a name for herself for bombastic stunts such as pushing to ban Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender person elected to Congress, from using the women\u2019s restroom and voting to eject Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House.\n\u201cI don't answer to the establishment,\u201d she said during her speech. \u201cI don't know those in the back room a single thing. I answer to the people.\u201d\nMace made her announcement at the Citadel, South Carolina\u2019s military college, where she became the first woman to graduate. That came after she had initially dropped out of high school following being raped as a teenager, an ordeal she has publicly recounted.\nDuring her announcement, Mace mentioned a series of hardline policies, mostly focusing on immigration and cutting the state\u2019s income tax to zero in five years.\nRep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) announced her campaign for governor. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) \u201cThey are all here, and we will work with ICE better than ever to ensure that anyone who is here illegally gets deported immediately, we will work with ICE in every respect,\u201d she said of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\u201cIf we need housing price we have it, if we need to have boots on the ground to help ICE, we will do it everything in our power, and we will not let another sanctuary share it dictate who gets to stay here when they're here illegally.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, Mace also said that she would oppose what she called the \u201cgender cult,\u201d citing how she called out Clemson University for having 15 gender options.\n\u201cI hold the line on women and kids, Insanity and education by vetoing any funding to any college that pushes gender ideology and refuses to define what a woman is,\u201d Mace said. \u201cIf a school erases women, it erases its right to your tax dollars.\u201d\nBut Mace faces a crowded primary. Fellow Rep. Ralph Norman, who endorsed Nikki Haley during the 2024 preisdential primary, is also running. Another opponent is state attorney general Al Wilson, whom Mace accused on the House floor of ignoring her report of sexual assault , though Wilson said that Mace\u2019s report never made it to his office .\nMace first came to Washington after serving in South Carolina\u2019s state legislature. In 2014, she staged a primary challenge to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) at the peak of the Tea Party movement. She later worked on the 2016 Trump campaign in the Palmetto State.\nIn 2020, she beat former Democratic congressman Joe Cunningham in South Carolina\u2019s 1st district. Initially, after the January 6 riot, Mace criticized Trump and said she held him responsible for the riot, though she voted against impeaching him.\nThat led to Trump endorsing her Republican primary opponent Katie Arrington in 2022. In response, Mace posted a video of herself infront of Trump Tower in New York.\nMace initially billed herself as a moderate Republican who was part of a \u201cCaucus of One,\u201d telling The Independent in 2023 that she was \u201cpro-baby, pro-gun, pro-pot, pro-gay .\u201d She initially worked on legislation to decriminalize cannabis and voted with Democrats to legalize protections for same-sex and interracial married couples.\nBut after her primary win, she moved significantly to the right. After initially voting for McCarthy as speaker, when former congressman Matt Gaetz filed a motion to vacate, Mace joined Gaetz and six other Republicans to eject McCarthy alongside every Democrat present at the time.\nGiven many of her opponents within the GOP, Mace would likely need to win the support of the president. While Trump has not made an endorsement in the race yet, her announcement ad features Trump praising her.\nSouth Carolina\u2019s gubernatorial primary will take place in June of next year.\nThank you for registering Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "Trump finally responds to Gavin Newsom\u2019s mocking \u2013 and busts out an old nickname to do it\nCalifornia Governor has been savagely mimicking president\u2019s social media tone in recent weeks to troll conservative media figures, many of whom have unwisely taken the bait\nPresident Donald Trump has hit back at California Gov. Gavin Newsom for brutally mimicking his social media style, dusting off a familiar nickname to deride his West Coast imitator in the process.\n\u201cGavin Newscum is way down in the polls,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social late on Wednesday night. \u201cHe is viewed as the man who is destroying the once Great State of California. I will save California!!!\u201d\nThe president repeatedly clashed with Trump in recent months, notably in January when devastating wildfires hit Southern California and again in June when Trump sent in the National Guard to suppress anti-ICE demonstrations in downtown L.A.\nThis month, the governor has begun savagely parodying the commander-in-chief\u2019s idiosyncratic posting style through his GovPressOffice X account, blustering about his greatness in all-caps and inventing infantile slurs with which to attack hostile media personalities, just as Trump has done for years.\nNewsom\u2019s team took just nine minutes to respond to the president\u2019s \u201cNewscum\u201d message, replying with three snowflake emojis.\nThey have since reposted another highly characteristic Trump post, in which the president accuses MSNBC of experiencing poor ratings, with the outraged comment: \u201cTRUMP IS IMITATING ME! \u2013 GCN.\u201d\nNewsom\u2019s new approach has seen Kid Rock and several Fox News presenters react angrily, with Dana Perino, Tomi Lahren, Raymond Arroyo, and Trace Gallagher, all taking the bait and engaging with the governor\u2019s arch-trolling.\nPerino hit out at the governor on Fox\u2019s The Five by urging him to stop for the sake of his assumed presidential ambitions and asking why his wife had not stepped in to prevent him from pursuing the pranks.\n\u201cDANA \u2018DING DONG\u2019 PERINO (NEVER HEARD OF HER UNTIL TODAY!) IS MELTING DOWN BECAUSE OF ME, GAVIN C. NEWSOM!\u201d came the inevitable reply.\n\u201cFOX HATES THAT I AM AMERICA\u2019S MOST FAVORITE GOVERNOR (\u2018RATINGS KING\u2019) SAVING AMERICA \u2013 WHILE TRUMP CAN\u2019T EVEN CONQUER THE \u2018BIG\u2019 STAIRS ON AIR FORCE ONE ANYMORE!!! TRUMP HAS \u2018LOST HIS STEP\u2019 AND FOX IS LOSING IT BECAUSE WHEN I TYPE, AMERICA NOW WINS!!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.\u201d\nLahren, meanwhile, berated Newsom and his \u201cteam of losers\u201d after they jokingly claimed to have confused MAGA activist Scott Presler with South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious for her anti-trans agenda.\nThe broadcaster was accused of being \u201cwoke\u201d when she complained about the offense caused.\nGallagher was also dispatched in ruthlessly faux-Trumpian style: \u201cBIRD-BRAIN TREY GALLAGHER (A SO-CALLED FOX \u2018NEWS\u2019 HOST THAT NOBODY HAS EVER HEARD OF) SAYS MY POSTS ARE \u2018CHILDISH\u2019 AND \u2018UNBECOMING\u2019 OF A LEADER \u2013 CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

TOTAL SNOOZE FEST! SAD!!!\u201d\nMediaite\u2019s Colby Hall has said that Newsom is \u201cshooting fish in a barrel,\u201d describing his feed as \u201can X-ray of Trumpian excess\u201d and praising him by saying he has not merely entered \u201cthe arena of schoolyard retorts\u201d but \u201cgrabbed the microphone, turned it upside down, and made the absurd impossible to ignore.\u201d\nSpeaking for himself last week, the governor said: \u201cI\u2019m just following [Trump\u2019s] example.

      "text": "'I am Trump in high heels': Rep. Nancy Mace seeks Trump endorsement at South Carolina town hall\n\"I would really like his support for governor,\" Mace told the crowd of Trump.\nDuring a town hall event, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace compared herself to President Donald Trump and requested he endorse her for South Carolina's governor -- a race where there is already a crowded slate of five candidates.\nIn Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Mace encountered a friendly crowd at her first town hall since launching her bid for governor and called on them to have Trump -- and his supporters -- back her.\n\"I'm just saying I've done a lot for the president, and if you talk to him, I would really like his support for governor,\" she said Wednesday during her first stop on her so-called \"Mother of All Town Halls\" tour.\nMace is one of several Republicans who have already thrown their hats into the ring for the state's top job. Attorney General Alan Wilson, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and Rep. Ralph Norman have also announced their campaigns.\nMace outlined her campaign promises, urging the audience to support her run to lead the state. She also likened herself to Trump, who is popular in the state after winning it in his 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential runs.\n\"I want to take what's broken in South Carolina, and I want to burn it down to the ground and build it right back up, right where it needs to be, because you've earned it. You deserve it, and you deserve someone who's going to work 24/7. I don't sleep. I went to bed at 1 a.m., and I was up at 4 a.m. OK, I am Trump in high heels. I love what I am doing. I mean, he doesn't sleep,\" she said.\nTrump enthusiastically backed Mace for Congress in 2024 after she endorsed him in the state's presidential primary. Their support for each other was a change after an earlier clash. One day after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Mace said Trump's \"entire legacy\" was \"wiped out\" by the siege. Later, during the 2022 midterms, Trump called Mace \"terrible\" and a letdown.\nTrump has not yet publicly commented on Mace's recent request for his endorsement.\nAs governor, Mace said child rapists would get the death penalty, eliciting a loud applause from the crowd. She said businesses who employ \"illegal aliens\" will be fined $1,000 a day, and hopes to bring down the state income tax.\nThe congresswoman repeatedly brought up her work to ban transgender women from using facilities on federal properties, such as bathrooms and locker rooms.\n\"We're going to stop that in South Carolina, because on day one, if you give me a bathroom bill -- state legislature, I will sign it into law. We're going to keep men out of women's spaces,\" she said.\nMace also recounted how she helped get Mike Johnson elected as speaker of the House by getting Trump on the phone with remaining Republican holdouts.\n\"When there's one guy in the room that can bring all of us together, I witnessed it, and that man was Donald J. Trump, so I was there for him when we got the speaker elected.\"\nMace engaged with an agreeable crowd during the short question-and-answer portion, during which topics including the Department of Government Efficiency, fluoride in water and Trump's promise to provide a tax credit on generators were raised.\nPressed by an audience member about Trump's promise to provide a tax credit on generators for individuals who live in dangerous or coastal communities following the floods, Mace said, \"I can absolutely remind him.\"\nMace said she hopes \"like hell\" DOGE is \"on its way\" to South Carolina, claiming she has helped DOGE find \"some of these crazy contracts\" that DOGE claims are wasteful.\n\"We've got to audit some of our agencies, particularly the Department of Education. I want to know where all the money is going, and can we take some of it out of the bureaucracy and give it to our teachers?\" she said.\nThe congresswoman said she would support \"any action to remove fluoride from our water and also ban chemtrails,\" the widely debunked conspiracy theory that claims the white lines from aircraft are releasing chemicals -- including for nefarious reasons.\nHer friendly town hall came at a time when many other members of Congress are facing hostile crowd at rowdy events. Earlier this week, a town hall crowd shouted at and heckled Republican Rep. Mike Flood as he touted Trump's massive policy and tax bill that was signed into law in July.\nABC News' Sarah Beth Hensley contributed to this report."

      "text": "With the first half of the 2025-26 legislative session in the rearview mirror, the South Carolina Policy Council is polling South Carolinians to see where they stand on the issues the legislature addressed last year and aim to address in 2026.\nWith a gubernatorial race on the horizon and both parties' primaries coming up we also wanted to see where our state stood on speculative candidates for both Democrats and Republicans. This poll also covers the issues of taxes and spending, transparency, education, parental rights, judicial reform, and lastly public sentiment towards tech and infrastructure.\nBelow you will find some of our key findings from our poll of 1,200 registered voters statewide, which was conducted by Targoz Market Research during the week of July 21 to 25. The poll\u2019s margin of error was plus or minus 2.77%.\nGubernatorial candidates and approval ratings\nTo start let's look at where voters are on Republican and Democratic gubernatorial candidates.\nRepublican-identifying voters were asked If the 2026 GOP primary for governor were held today, which of the following candidates would you choose? Their responses were as follows:\n- 16% selected Nancy Mace, U.S. Congresswoman\n- 15% selected Alan Wilson, Attorney General\n- 8% selected Pam Evette, Lieutenant Governor\n- 6% selected Ralph Norman, U.S. Congressman\n- 3% selected Josh Kimbrell, State Senator\n- 52% remain undecided\nAmong individuals who identified as Democrats, when asked, if the 2026 Democratic primary for governor were held today, which of the following candidates would you vote for? Respondents answered as follows:\n- 5% selected Jermaine Johnson, State Representative\n- 5% selected Jeffrey Graham, State Senator\n- 2% selected Russell Ott, State Senator\n- 2% selected Ed Sutton, State Senator\n- 2% selected Mandy Powers Norrell, Former State Representative\n- 83% remain undecided\nFollowing the conclusion of the first half of the 2025-26 legislative session, 49% of South Carolina voters approve of the way the South Carolina State Legislature is handling its job, while 43% disapprove. This is a decline from 55% approval in January from our poll earlier this year.\nTaxes and spending\nStates across the country are slashing taxes, and voters want to see South Carolina follow suit. across the board support eliminating income taxes. 73% of South Carolina voters support eliminating income taxes, while just 17% oppose the elimination of income taxes.\n74% of voters also believe that eliminating S.C.\u2019s state income tax would make the state more attractive for businesses and job creation.\nSCPC has advocated for a spending limit to prevent spending increases year over year by population and inflation growth. Voters agree with this proposition. 68% of Voters would support a state law codifying a spending limit based on population plus inflation while only 16% would oppose the measure.\nEducation\nWhen asked about their satisfaction with the way things are going in K-12 public education in South Carolina:\n- 47% were dissatisfied\n- 42% were satisfied\nA proposed Senate bill (S.537) would prohibit South Carolina public schools from adopting mandatory grading floors, which require teachers to assign minimum grades (e.g., 50 or 60 out of 100) for incomplete or low-quality work, and mandate zeros for assignments not submitted. 51% of South Carolinians support this proposal, while just 33% oppose.\nAdditionally South Carolinians strongly favor parental rights in the classroom. When asked how important it was that parents have the right to review all school curricula, access their child\u2019s educational records, and choose between public, private, or homeschool options without state interference, 72% said that\u2019s important with 56% saying it's very important.\nTransparency\nSouth Carolina voters strongly support efforts to increase transparency in both legislative proceedings and state budget decisions.\nWhen asked whether all legislative committee and subcommittee meetings should be livestreamed and archived for public viewing, 80% of respondents expressed support, with 53% saying they \"strongly support\" the measure.\nSupport was similarly strong for greater transparency around earmark spending. 81% of voters said they support a state law requiring full public disclosure of earmarks in the budget, including the name of the sponsoring lawmaker, the recipient, the amount, and the project\u2019s purpose, before the budget is approved.\nData centers and energy\nTemperatures on data centers remain mixed. When asked if they support the construction of new data centers in their community, 43% expressed opposition, with 42% expressing support to the idea.\nHowever, enthusiasm declines when energy costs come into the equation. Of those 42% who supported, when asked if they would still support building data centers even if it led to higher utility bills to fund infrastructure upgrades, less than half of them would continue to support.\nEnergy baseload is a critical component of that question, as the primary driver behind rising rates. Increased consumption will come at a cost to consumers. When asked if they supported expanding nuclear energy in South Carolina, 58% supported expanding nuclear energy, while only 27% opposed.\nTakeaways\nThe first take away revolves around the gubernatorial primaries. Both races are wide open with plenty of room. The majority of South Carolina voters on both sides of the isle are still undecided.\nAdditionally, these poll results highlight several key policy issues in South Carolina. South Carolinians across political party lines support eliminating income tax, adopting spending limits, and share concerns about data centers.\nEvaluating these crosstabs should be a reminder that the partisan political divide is not all as it seems, and that voters are united on far more issues than they think.\nFor the full crosstabs, see the links below:\nCrosstabs Generation, Income, Homeownership\nTransparency Initiative Disclosure\nIf you have questions about the poll or would like to arrange an interview, please email [email protected] or call 803-779-5022.\nMethodology statement:\n- Online poll of 1,200 registered voters in South Carolina conducted by Targoz Market Research.\n- Only respondents who passed our data quality checks were included in the final results and compensated for participating.\n- Sampling was stratified by demographics and geography.\n- Respondents were compensated for their participation.\n- Results were weighted by demographics, party, geography, and behavioral measures to properly reflect the profile of the state.\n- Estimated margin of error: +/- 2.77%\n- Fieldwork: July 21-25, 2025\n- Due to weighting and rounding, percentages may not always total exactly 100%.\nThis report may be republished in whole or in part, provided that proper credit is given to the author(s) and the South Carolina Policy Council."

I don't really care,\u201d Mace exclaimed as Connolly asked her to let him finish.\n\u201cYou want penises in women's bathrooms, and I'm not going to have it,\u201d she continued.\nThe slur is one of the \u201cmost extreme slurs for a trans person, similar to other extreme slurs for other historically marginalized groups,\u201d according to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.\nAfter order was restored, Connolly, a Democrat, condemned her outburst. \u201cHere in the committee, a level of the quorum requires us to try consciously to avoid slurs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can have debate and policy discussion without offending human beings who are fellow citizens.\u201d\nAgain, Mace interrupted.\n\u201cMr. Chairman, I\u2019m not gonna be counseled by a man over men and women\u2019s spaces, or men who have mental health issues dressing as women,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not being counseled by some guy over this.\u201d\nBut Committee Chair James Comer, a fellow Republican, dismissed the remark and said he was not \u201cup to date\u201d on his \u201cLGBTQ terminology.\u201d\nMace\u2019s communications director Gabrielle Lipsky told The Independent, \u201cthe only thing the Left has going for them is political correctness because they are so wrong on everything.\u201d\n\u201cSo far, the President Donald Trump White House has exposed their failures and abuses of our federal government, and we are determined to keep going,\u201d she continued. \u201cMaybe the Left should start worrying about how their failures impact the American people, the national deficit, and Western values instead of obsessing over \u2018mean words.\u2019\u201d\nConnolly isn\u2019t the only one concerned by Mace\u2019s outburst.\nBriahna Joy Gray, an attorney and former press secretary for Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 2020 presidential campaign, condemned the remarks on X.\n\u201cNancy Mace once seemed like one of the more reasonable Republicans given her stance on reproductive issues,\u201d Gray wrote. \u201cNow she\u2019s screeching \u201ct*****\u201d repeatedly while claiming it\u2019s about protecting cis women.\u201d\n\u201cTo be clear: That slur is about denigrating someone\u2019s identity, not their behavior/political beliefs,\u201d she added.\nThis is far from the first time Mace has used the anti-trans slur. The lawmaker used the slur in two separate videos posted to X in early December, and later complained when the social media site flagged one of them for potentially violating its rules of conduct.\nShe has also repeatedly leveled anti-trans rhetoric against her colleague, Representative Sarah McBride, who is first trans member of Congress. Mace, in addition to repeatedly misgendering Bride and others, even introduced a bill to bar transgender women from using women\u2019s bathrooms in the Capitol.\nMace\u2019s position on the LGBTQ+ community has radically shifted in recent years.\nIn 2021, she was one of the only Republicans to sponsor the Serving Our LGBTQ Veterans Act, which proposed establishing a Center for LGBTQ Veterans within the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nThat same year, she even called for \u201ctransgender equality\u201d while asserting herself as a pro-LGBTQ+ rights lawmaker.\n\u201cI strongly support LGBTQ rights and equality,\u201d Mace told the Washington Examiner. \u201cNo one should be discriminated against.\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a black-and-white issue,\u201d Mace added. \u201cI do believe that religious liberty, the First Amendment, gay rights, and transgender equality can all coexist. I\u2019m also a constitutionalist, and we have to ensure anti-discrimination laws don\u2019t violate First Amendment rights or religious freedom.\u201d\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"
