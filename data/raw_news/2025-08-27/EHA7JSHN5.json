  "title": "Online Learning's Moment: How Colleges Struggle To Meet Rising Demand",
  "description": "A collaboration between Quality Matters, Eduventures and EDUCAUSE has resulted in new data revealing how today\u2019s digital learning landscape has fundamentally shifted.",
  "content": "Nearly nine in 10 colleges plan to expand online programs to meet surging demand\u2014a complete reversal from just two decades ago when policymakers actively restricted digital education. At that time, the \u201c50% rule\u201d colleges and universities to seek special approval if more than half of their courses or programs went digital, or if more than half of their students participated in online learning. This was a regulatory response to legitimate concerns in the 1990s around correspondence courses (read as: paper, pencil, mail), educational quality and student protection.\n\nBut a between Quality Matters, Eduventures and EDUCAUSE has resulted in new data that reveal how today\u2019s digital learning landscape has fundamentally shifted. \n\n\n\n According to the 10th edition of the , nearly three-quarters of institutions report increased interest in online education from graduate students, 66% from adult undergrads and 60% from historically traditional-age college students.\n\n\n\n Chief online learning officers surveyed shared that as a result, institutions of higher education can barely keep pace with student demand for online learning, and most remain structurally unprepared for the transformation they are attempting to manage.\n\n\"Online learning has moved from the margins to the mainstream of higher education. The real story isn\u2019t just the demand; it\u2019s whether colleges can adapt their culture, structures and teaching models fast enough to keep pace,\u201d says Dr. Bethany Simunich, vice president of innovation and research at Quality Matters and co-author of the report.\n\nWe\u2019ve moved from policy debates about limiting online education to a reality where colleges struggle to meet legitimate demand. But this transformation exposes a troubling pattern that continually plagues higher education: institutions consistently lag behind market forces they helped create, then scramble to catch up when disruption becomes unavoidable.\n\nThe growth in students\u2019 interest in online education challenges assumptions about the demand for this modality, particularly in a postpandemic era. Traditional undergraduates digital courses despite expressing preferences for in-person learning, a cognitive dissonance that chief online learning officers noted as particularly revealing.\n\nBehavioral economists recognize this contradiction as the gap between stated preferences and revealed preferences. Students may idealize campus life, but their enrollment decisions shed light on education's new reality: the need to accommodate work schedules, housing constraints and financial pressures can make traditional college attendance economically untenable for a growing number of learners.\n\n\"Since 2020, demand for online learning has surged, yet too many students still hit unnecessary roadblocks that delay or derail their degree,\" says Shawna Thayer, CEO of Sophia Learning, an online platform that provides self-paced, transferable college-level courses. \"The real test for institutions is making sure students can get the credits they need, when they need them. Remove those barriers, and you give students a clear, efficient path to completion.\"\n\nDr. Mark Milliron, president and CEO of National University, describes today's online learners as the \u2014working adults, caregivers and veterans logging in from job sites, kitchen tables and military base housing. \"We build systems that fit their lives\u2014anytime, anywhere\u2014not the other way around,\" Milliron says.\n\nThe demographic driving this demand mirrors my experience crafting distance education policy 20 years ago. These aren\u2019t traditional students choosing convenience over rigor. They're learners for whom campus-based education may represent an inaccessible luxury and who need education to bend around existing responsibilities rather than the reverse.\n\nThe Capacity Paradox: Where Need Meets Institutional Failure\n\nBeneath these encouraging statistics about a growing interest in online education among learners lies a concerning disparity. Public four-year institutions report ambitious expansion plans, with over half expecting to launch five or more new online programs in the next three years. Community colleges\u2014which often serve the populations most dependent on flexible, affordable education\u2014tell a starkly different story: only one in five plan similar growth.\n\nThis capacity mismatch becomes more troubling when it's considered alongside persistent infrastructure gaps. A decade after the CHLOE Report first identified digital access barriers, 95% of institutions still report , with community college students disproportionately affected.\n\nThe pattern is emblematic of a broader challenge in American higher education: market dynamics reward institutions for serving populations with existing advantages while underinvesting in those serving students with the greatest need. Community colleges, already , struggle to provide the comprehensive faculty development and student support systems that effective online education often requires.\n\nPerhaps most revealing in the data is how institutions are approaching the integration of artificial intelligence. While 77% of chief online learning officers believe AI will become crucial within two years, only 23% have developed institution-wide strategies. Another 66% of these professionals describe fragmented, department-level efforts with no coordinated approach. Nearly 10% have no AI strategy whatsoever, which should concern anyone who remembers how unprepared institutions were for pandemic-driven online learning demand.\n\n\"[The finding] that nearly 10% of institutions have no AI strategy is a five-alarm fire for higher education,\" says Josh Jones, CEO of QuantHub, a data and AI skills training platform offering online courses and credentials. \"We're watching history repeat itself. This mirrors exactly how universities approached online learning in 2010, and we know how unprepared that left them for 2020. But this time, the stakes are higher. [I]nstitutions without coherent AI strategies aren't just falling behind\u2014they're failing to prepare students for a fundamentally transformed workforce.\"\n\nHigher education leaders and policymakers alike have a habit of treating transformative technologies as experimental rather than strategic opportunities. I observed this behavior in the early days of policy development for distance education. Then, when demand exploded during the pandemic, many institutions that pilot programs provided an insufficient foundation for institutional transformation.\n\nThe growing need to prepare the workforce for AI makes the fragmentation across higher education institutions even more consequential than the online learning adoption curve. Current institutional approaches favor operational efficiency over educational innovation: 49% of survey respondents cited AI's potential for workload reduction and 46% noted its potential for course preparation. Fewer institutions are exploring personalized learning or intelligent advising. This suggests institutions may be optimizing AI for administrative convenience rather than student outcomes.\n\nDespite a decade of online education growth, institutional investment in human capital has plateaued. Only 28% of institutions report faculty are fully prepared for online course design, a since 2020. Meanwhile, 47% of online courses, meaning institutions are putting the pressure of maintaining instructional quality and mastering evolving technologies on some of their least-supported instructors.\n\nThis creates a vulnerability that compounds the AI strategy fragmentation problem. \"When nearly half of online courses are taught by adjuncts, fragmented AI strategies become even more dangerous,\" Jones says. These instructors, often working across multiple institutions with minimal institutional support, become students' primary interface with AI-enhanced learning environments\u2014yet they receive the least comprehensive training.\n\nThe pattern mirrors trends in American higher education\u2019s employment practices, where institutions have while reducing investment in professional development. From a policy perspective, these are the same institutional capacity constraints we encountered when expanding distance education access two decades ago: removing regulatory barriers meant little if institutions lacked human resources to deliver quality education at scale.\n\nThe competitive landscape in higher education has intensified, with 83% of public four-year institutions reporting increased online competition, which suggests a maturing market. But rather than triggering a race to the bottom, this pressure appears to be driving innovation in student support systems and educational quality.\n\nMichael London, founder and CEO of Uwill, which provides teletherapy and digital mental health services to colleges, identifies this as higher education's next competitive frontier. \"Online learning is only as strong as the support behind it,\" London says. \"To ensure students thrive, we must provide online student services that are as innovative and accessible as the courses themselves. Mental health support isn't optional; it is a foundation for successful learning in any environment.\"\n\nThis evolution represents significant progress from early distance education debates, when critics worried that online students would be isolated and under-supported. Online program leaders that online learners require more comprehensive support, not less, precisely because they're balancing education with complex life circumstances.\n\nNational University's exemplifies this strategic thinking, blending virtual access to academic coaching, mental health support and career services with physical spaces for in-person connection. It's designed around the recognition that online learners need support systems engineered for their actual lives rather than traditional campus services adapted for an online environment.\n\nThe competitive environment is also accelerating credential innovation, with community colleges leading transformation despite capacity constraints. Investment in non-degree credentials like certificates and microcredentials has more than doubled since 2018-19, with nearly 70% of public two-year colleges driving innovation while four-year institutions lag despite similar student demand.\n\nPerhaps most encouraging is how market pressure appears to be elevating quality. Michael Zimmerman, president of , an online two-year college, notes that student expectations have evolved considerably. \"Students are looking for more affordable and relevant pathways to achieve their career goals,\u201d says Zimmerman. \u201cAnd it's not only working adults fueling the demand for online, it's Gen Z too. But Gen Z expects more than what colleges have typically delivered online. They want community and personalization.\"\n\nIndustry leaders report that AI integration is revolutionizing quality standards and course design processes. \"When I talk with faculty and instructional designers, it's clear that AI is starting to reshape how they think about quality and course design,\" says Dr. Whitney Kilgore, chief academic officer iDesign, a firm that works with colleges to design online programs. \"The conversation isn't just about access anymore; it's about how to use technology to raise the bar on quality.\"\n\nThis sentiment represents a fundamental shift from the access-versus-quality debates that shaped early distance education policy. Today\u2019s challenge isn't whether online education can match the quality and rigor of in-person courses; rather, it's whether institutions can innovate quickly enough to meet rising expectations while maintaining educational integrity.\n\nThe institutions that will thrive are those learning from the online education adoption curve rather than repeating it. While the CHLOE 10 Report documents many of these institutional challenges in detail, the strategic implications point to a few critical adaptations for colleges and universities:\n\nDevelop comprehensive AI strategies immediately, before they become crisis-driven necessities. This means establishing governance structures that integrate AI planning into academic and operational strategies, comprehensive faculty development programs and student success metrics designed for AI-enhanced learning environments.\n\nAddress the community college capacity crisis as both an equity imperative and economic necessity. Policymakers and institutional leaders must recognize that the greatest unmet demand for accessible higher education exists at institutions serving the most economically vulnerable populations. Targeted investments in technology infrastructure, faculty development and student support at these institutions represent crucial interventions for maintaining higher education's social mobility function.\n\nInvest in systematic faculty development that goes beyond emergency pandemic training to encompass both innovation and technological literacy, with particular attention to supporting adjunct faculty who deliver nearly half of online instruction but receive the least institutional support.\n\nEngineer student support systems around online learners' complex life circumstances rather than adapting campus-based services for digital delivery. This includes flexible scheduling for advising and support services, proactive intervention systems and comprehensive mental health resources accessible outside traditional institutional hours.\n\nBuild coherent data capabilities that enable evidence-based decision making about program design, student success intervention and institutional effectiveness.\n\nThe regulatory framework that once restricted online education has evolved to enable innovation. The question now is whether institutional strategies can evolve as rapidly as student needs and technological capabilities. This is a challenge that extends far beyond higher education to encompass how established organizations adapt to technological disruption.\n\nAs someone who witnessed the first wave of online education policy development, I'm struck by how far we've traveled from those Capitol Hill hearing rooms where lawmakers worried about students taking too many courses online. Now, the work begins to figure out how to scale digital education responsibly and ensure it serves the learners who represent higher education's future.",

Kuenzi,\nRebecca R. Skinner,\nand David P. Smole\nAnalysts in Social Legislation\nDomestic Social Policy Division\nCongressional Research Service \u02dc\nThe Library of Congress\nDistance Education and Title IV of the Higher\nEducation Act: Policy, Practice, and Reauthorization\nSummary\nThe phrase \u201cdistance education\u201d (DE) has been used to describe a wide variety\nof structured learning environments that occur away from the \u201ctraditional\u201d bricks and\nmortar classroom setting. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) identifies five\ndifferent DE delivery modes: correspondence study, interactive videoconferencing,\ntelecourses, asynchronous online instruction, and synchronous online instruction.\nBased on an ED survey, 56% of institutions of higher education (IHEs) offered DE\ncourses in 2000-2001, in which over 3 million students were enrolled.\nTo participate in federal student aid (FSA) programs authorized under Title IV\nof the Higher Education Act (HEA), institutions must meet eligibility requirements\nknown collectively as the 50% rules. According to the rules, if telecommunications\ncourses and correspondence courses constitute at least half of the total courses\noffered at an IHE, then telecommunications courses are considered to be\ncorrespondence courses; and if more than 50% of an IHE\u2019s courses are\ncorrespondence courses, or if 50% or more of an IHE\u2019s students are enrolled in\ncorrespondence courses, the IHE loses its Title IV eligibility. Students\u2019 eligibility for\nFSA also depends on their own DE coursetaking.\nThe Distance Education Demonstration Project (DEDP) waives certain\neligibility requirements for about two dozen IHEs in order to \u201ctest the quality and\nviability\u201d of DE programs (P.L. 105-244). An ED report on the DEDP concluded\nthat these restrictions should be loosened and that this would have few negative\nconsequences. A GAO study of the impact of the 50% rules concluded that doing so\nwithout management accountability would probably increase occurrences of fraud\nand abuse. GAO recommended that ED study the cost of waiving the 50% rules.\nTo be eligible for Title IV programs, IHEs must be accredited by an agency or\nassociation recognized by ED as a reliable authority for assessing the quality of\neducation. There are several special challenges associated with evaluating and\naccrediting DE programs and courses. DE courses and programs are offered through\ndifferent modes of instruction, requiring accreditors to evaluate the curriculum and\ninstruction, faculty support, student support, and student learning outcomes of these\nprograms in different ways. DE programs and courses are offered by a variety of\nproviders, ranging from traditional four-year institutions to online degree-granting\ninstitutions to corporate universities. DE is also used for short-term continuing\neducation and training in professional fields, often separate from degree programs.\nDue to the substantial changes in the availability of technology and demand for\nDE courses since the 1998 reauthorization of the HEA, there are numerous issues that\nmay be discussed during the upcoming reauthorization. These include whether to\nreauthorize the DEDP; whether to change the 50% rules used in determining the\neligibility of IHEs to participate in programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA;\nand whether to change the requirements for federal recognition of accrediting\norganizations that are applicable to DE. This report will be updated.\nContents\nIntroduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nWhat Is Distance Education? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\nHow Prevalent is Distance Education? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\nDE Course Offerings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\nDE Course Enrollment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nTitle IV of the Higher Education Act as It Affects Distance Education . . . . . . . . 6\nInstitutional Eligibility and the 50% Rules . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\nStudent Eligibility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\nTelecommunications and Correspondence Course Programs . . . . . . . 10\nStudent Enrollment Status . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\nCost of Attendance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\nThe Distance Education Demonstration Program . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\nEffect of Waiving the 50% Rules . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\nAccreditation and Distance Education . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\nFederal Recognition of Accrediting Organizations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\nStandards Used to Evaluate DE Programs and Courses . . . . . . . . . . . 17\nIssues for Reauthorization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\nDistance Education Demonstration Program . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n50% Rules . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\nDE at Proprietary and Postsecondary Vocational Institutions . . . . . . . . . . . 20\nAccreditation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\nList of Figures\nFigure 1.

It is likely that these issues will reemerge in the 109th Congress as\nlegislation is introduced to reauthorize the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965.1\nThe issues include whether to reauthorize the Distance Education Demonstration\nProject (DEDP); whether to amend or eliminate the 50% rules applicable to\ndetermining the eligibility of institutions of higher education (IHEs) to participate in\nprograms authorized under Title IV of the HEA; and whether to change the\nrequirements for federal recognition of accrediting organizations that are applicable\nto DE. This report explores the growth of DE into a significant component of the\nmodern postsecondary education landscape and then examines a number of issues\ninvolved in the debate surrounding HEA reauthorization.2\nMany observers trace the origins of DE to correspondence study3 and in\nparticular to the founding of the University of Chicago and its correspondence\nprogram and extension division in 1892.4 According to University archivists,\n1 P.L. 89-329, as amended by P.L. 105-244 [20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\net seq.]. For more\ninformation on issues related to the reauthorization of the HEA see CRS Issue Brief\nIB10097,\nThe Higher Education Act: Reauthorization Status and Issues, by James B.\nStedman.\n2 In this report, our discussion of DE is limited to how it relates to the reauthorization of the\nHEA. However, federal support for DE programs and initiatives is also provided through\nother programs (e.g., programs authorized under ESEA \u2014 the Elementary and Secondary\nEducation Act of 1965, as amended (P.L. 107-110); Perkins III \u2014 the Carl D. Perkins\nVocational and Applied Technology Education Amendments of 1998 (P.L. 105-332); and\nWIA \u2014 Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220)).\n3 According to Von Pittman, \u201cEarly collegiate-level correspondence study was often called\n\u2018home study\u2019 to distinguish it from the product of proprietary schools. For much the same\nreason, colleges and universities began to call it \u2018independent study\u2019 beginning in the late\n1960s,\u201d Moore & Anderson,\nHandbook of Distance Education, 2003.\n4 Michael Moore,\nContemporary Issues in American Distance Education (New York:\nPergamon, 1990); and Watkins & Wright,\nThe Foundations of American Distance\n(continued...)\nCRS-2\nThe campus of the University was never meant to contain its educational\nmission. As conceived by William R. Harper, the University of Chicago\nincluded an extension division that would bring instruction to students who could\nnot work toward their degrees on campus. The extension offered three methods\nof instruction: students could learn by attending a series of scheduled lectures\n(lecture-study), register for courses offered in an extension center (class-study),\nor receive instruction through the mail at home (correspondence-study). At a\ntime when state universities were bound to their rural land-grant campuses and\nthe concept of adult education was still new, the University\u2019s offering of\nextension courses in the heart of the city provided opportunities for students for\nwhom conventional higher education was out of reach.5\nThe promise of bringing educational opportunity to individuals who lack access\nto traditional classrooms has remained the central rationale for DE up to the present\nday. In the last reauthorization of the HEA the Congress stated, \u201cDistance education\nholds the promise of expanding access to higher education at a time when the number\nof postsecondary students will be expanding, including those seeking retraining and\nthose in rural communities without access to local colleges and universities\u201d (H.Rept.\n105-481).\nWhile its purpose has been longstanding and straightforward, what actually\nconstitutes DE is often unclear and has changed over time. The remainder of this\nsection discusses the characteristics that define DE and the extent to which DE\noccurs in the U.S. at the postsecondary education level. The following section\nexamines DE in the context of the HEA and Title IV in particular. This includes\ndiscussing the rules governing institutional and student eligibility for receipt of\nFederal Student Aid (FSA). The DEDP, the effect of eligibility rules on DE, and\naccreditation of DE are also discussed. The report concludes with a review of DE\nissues likely to arise during HEA reauthorization.\nWhat Is Distance Education?\nThe phrase DE has been\nDistance Education: The process of extending\nused to describe a wide variety\nlearning, or delivering instructional resource-\no f s t r u c t u r e d l e a r n i n g\nsharing opportunities, to locations away from a\nenvironments that occur away\nclassroom, building or site, to another classroom,\nfrom the \u201ctraditional\u201d bricks\nbuilding or site by using video, audio, computer,\nand mortar classroom setting.\nmultimedia communications, or some combination\nThe definition in the text box\nof these with other traditional delivery methods.\n\u2014\nInstructional Technology Council\n4 (...continued)\nEducation: A Century of Collegiate Correspondence Study (Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt\n1991).\n5 Alice Schreyer,\nThe University and the City: A Centennial View of the University of\nChicago (Chicago: University of Chicago Library, 1992), available at\n[http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/spcl/centcat/home.html].\nCRS-3\ntypifies the current use of the term.6\nHowever, with the growing use of telecommunications technology in education\ngenerally, there is not always a clear distinction between DE and\ntraditional\neducation. Computer and network technology now provide students and teachers\nwith means of communicating that are on par with what previously could have been\nachieved only through face-to-face interaction. E-mail can replace a visit to the\ndepartment office. A chat room can replace a group study session in the student\nunion. Some types of lab work can be completed in a student\u2019s dorm room rather\nthan at a computer lab. The point at which an educational process conducted via\ntelecommunications technology ceases to be \u201ctraditional\u201d education and begins to be\n\u201cdistance\u201d education has become blurred.\nThe Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has developed a somewhat arbitrary standard\nfor categorizing DE based on the proportion of content that is delivered online. It\nclassifies an \u201conline\u201d course as having at least 80% of the course content delivered\nonline, a \u201cblended\u201d or \u201chybrid\u201d course as 30% to 80% online content, a \u201cweb\nfacilitated\u201d course as under 30% online content, and a \u201ctraditional\u201d course as having\nno online content.7\nYet, it also recognizes that the potential of online learning goes well beyond\nsimply learning outside the traditional classroom. Telecommunications technologies\nnot only allow learning to take place anywhere, but also at\nany time \u2014 most\nimportantly, when it is convenient for the student. When time elapses during the\nexchange in a learning experience (e.g., students listening to a prerecorded lecture or\nexchanging messages on an online discussion group), this process is referred to as\nasynchronous learning.\nIn its report to Congress on the status of the DEDP (discussed later in this\nreport), ED includes\nasynchronous learning in its list of DE delivery modes:\nCorrespondence study \u2014 the institution mails lessons to students who work\nindependently and periodically submit assignments and examinations for grading\nby an instructor;\nInteractive videoconferencing \u2014 telecommunications networks link a faculty\nmember with students located in classrooms around the state or region;\nTelecourses \u2014 instruction is delivered on videotape (or through cable\ndistribution) to students studying at home;\nAsynchronous online instruction \u2014 students have access to electronic classrooms\nthat contain instructional materials with links to other online resources, and tools\nto facilitate group discussion, small group activities, and one-to-one\ncommunication; and\n6 Instructional Technology Council website hosted by Dallas TeleLearning, available at\n[http://telelearning.dcccd.edu/].\n7 I.

How much spatial and temporal distance must there be for a learning\nexperience to be termed distance education? Much of the remainder of this report is\ndevoted to clarifying the boundaries of DE set by Title IV of the HEA. However,\nbefore doing so, we first describe the prevalence of DE in the U.S. postsecondary\neducational system.\nHow Prevalent is Distance Education?\nGiven the elusive definition of DE, it is quite difficult to measure the extent to\nwhich DE is being utilized. The most recent and reliable data on the utilization of\nDE come from ED\u2019s 2001 survey of two-year and four-year, Title IV-eligible, degree-\ngranting institutions based on the Postsecondary Education Quick Information\nSystem (PEQIS).9\nIn the PEQIS survey, DE was defined as courses delivered to off-campus\nlocations through audio, video, or computer transmission either synchronously or\nasynchronously. This definition excluded courses delivered on-campus, through\nwritten correspondence, or at a remote site visited in person by the instructor.\nCourses involving on-campus meetings for lab work or exams or occasional lectures\ncould still be considered DE in the PEQIS survey.\nDE Course Offerings. Fifty-six percent of IHEs offered DE courses in\nacademic year 2000-2001 and an additional 12% reported planning to do so in the\nnext three years. DE is much more prevalent among public schools (90% of two-year\nand 89% of four-year) than among private schools (16% of two-year and 40% of\nfour-year). Perhaps not surprisingly, small schools have been less likely than large\nschools to offer DE courses (41% for IHEs with enrollments under 3,000 compared\nto 95% for IHEs with enrollments of 3,000 or greater). Data on IHEs offering DE\ncourses are presented in\nTable 1.\n8 U.S. Department of Education,\nSecond Report to Congress on the Distance Education\nDemonstration Program, 2003.\n9 Available data on use of DE at institutions that do not report to PEQIS (i.e., non-Title IV-\neligible and/or non-degree-granting institutions) are not reliable enough to produce\nnationally representative estimates. ED conducted the PEQIS survey in 1995 and 1998;\nhowever, due to sampling differences, much of the data are not comparable to the 2001\nsurvey.

Most of these courses were\ntaken for college credit (2.9 million), primarily undergraduate credit (2.4 million).\nPublic two-year institutions enrolled just under half (1.5 million) of the total and just\nunder half (1.4 million) of those enrolled for college credit.

Detail\nmay not sum to totals because of rounding, missing data, or because too few cases were reported for\na reliable estimate for private two-year institutions.\na. Data for private two-year institutions are not reported in a separate category because too few\nprivate two-year institutions in the sample offered distance education courses in 2000-2001 to\nmake reliable estimates. Data for private two-year institutions are included in the totals and in\nanalysis by other institutional characteristics. Thus, total enrollments do not always equal the\nsum of categories of courses.\nb. Two-year branches of public four-year institutions occasionally offer graduate/first-professional\nlevel courses.\n\u2021 Reporting standards not met.\nTitle IV of the Higher Education Act as It\nAffects Distance Education\nTitle IV of the HEA authorizes federal programs that provide student financial\naid to support attendance at a variety of postsecondary institutions, including public\ninstitutions, private not-for-profit institutions, for-profit (proprietary) institutions, and\ntrade and technical schools. In order for a student attending a postsecondary\ninstitution to receive Title IV student aid, the institution must:\n! be licensed or otherwise legally authorized to provide postsecondary\neducation in the state in which it is located;\n! be accredited by an agency recognized for that purpose by the\nSecretary of Education; and\nCRS-7\n! be deemed eligible and certified to participate in federal student aid\nprograms by ED.11\nIn addition to these requirements, IHEs also must comply with specific statutory\nrequirements related to DE. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in\nan institution losing its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. At the same\ntime, certain provisions generally applicable to institutional eligibility may also affect\nstudent eligibility for Title IV aid. This section discusses aspects of DE related to\ninstitutional and student eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and also\nexamines how DE affects the accreditation of IHEs.\nIn contrast to the pedagogically-based definition of DE discussed above, under\nTitle IV of the HEA, the terms \u201ccorrespondence courses\u201d and \u201ctelecommunications\ncourses,\u201d are used rather than \u201cdistance education,\u201d (with the exception of the\nDEDP). Federal regulations12 define a correspondence course as a home study course\noffered by an IHE in which the IHE provides the student with instructional materials.\nUpon completing a section of the instructional materials, the student takes a\ncorresponding examination provided by the IHE and returns it to the IHE for grading.\nIn contrast, a telecommunications course is a course that is offered via the application\nof technology. This includes courses offered by Internet, audio or computer\ntransmission,13 or television. As some correspondence courses also include some\nform of telecommunications technology, courses are classified as correspondence or\ntelecommunications based on the predominant mode of instruction.14 As will be\ndiscussed in the next section, in certain circumstances telecommunications courses\nmay arbitrarily be considered to be correspondence courses for purposes of\ndetermining institutional eligibility for participation in Title IV programs.\nInstitutional Eligibility and the 50% Rules\nTo participate in Title IV student aid programs, institutions must meet eligibility\nrequirements that specifically apply to DE.15 Several of these requirements are\nknown collectively as the 50% rules. The 50% rules were incorporated into the HEA\nduring the 1992 reauthorization, in part, as a response to cases of fraud and abuse that\n11 For more information on institutional eligibility requirements to participate in Title IV\nprograms, see CRS Report RL31926,\nInstitutional Eligibility for Participation in Title IV\nStudent Aid Programs Under the Higher Education Act: Background and Issues, by\nRebecca R. Skinner.\n12 34 C.F.R.\u00a7 600.2.\n13 This could include, for example, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite\ntransmission.\n14 Courses delivered through video cassettes or discs are considered correspondence courses\nunless the IHE delivers the same instruction to students attending classroom-based courses\nduring the same year.

(Hereafter cited as ED,\nFSA Handbook, 2004-2005.)\n15 Many of these requirements may be waived by the Secretary under the DEDP. The DEDP\nand applicable waivers are discussed later in this report.\nCRS-8\nhad occurred at institutions that primarily delivered instruction through print-based\nmedia. According to the report by the House Committee on Education and Labor for\nH.R. 3553 (the 1992 House bill to reauthorize the HEA):\nIn amending this section of the Higher Education Act, the Committee intends to\nimprove the integrity of the Federal student assistance programs and to prevent\nfraud and abuse in the programs ... H.R. 3553 reforms the criteria by which\ninstitutions become eligible to participate in the Title IV programs. Institutions\nwhich offer half or more of their courses as correspondence will no longer be\nconsidered eligible institutions under this title. (H.Rept. 102-447)\nReport language for the Senate bill (S. 1150) to reauthorize the HEA was even\nstronger on this issue:\nThe integrity of title IV programs has been harmed immeasurably by persistent\nreports of fraud and abusive actions by schools and other program participants,\nespecially in the Stafford loan program where profit incentives are great ... There\nhave also been numerous instances of abuse in the use of correspondence\ncourses, particularly in short-term programs. While the Committee understands\nthat there are many legitimate uses of correspondence courses, this bill seeks to\naddress the areas of abuse by eliminating the use of student aid for any\ncorrespondence course that is not part of an associate\u2019s or bachelor\u2019s degree\nprogram. Further, this bill removes from eligibility any school that offers more\nthan 50% of its courses by correspondence. (S.Rept. 102-204)\nThe compromise that came out of the conference committee was eventually\npassed as P.L. 102-325 and contained the following rules:\n1. At IHEs that are not institutes or schools described in \u00a7521(4)(C) of the\nCarl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (P.L.\n101-392)16 and at which\nat least 50% of the programs lead to an associate,\nbaccalaureate, or graduate degree, telecommunications courses shall\nnot\nbe considered to be correspondence courses, unless the sum of\ntelecommunications and correspondence courses\nequals or exceeds 50%\n(HEA, \u00a7484(l)(1)).17\n16 Section 521(4)(C) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education\nAct (P.L. 101-392) defines an\narea vocational education school as \u201ca technical institute or\nvocational school used exclusively or principally for the provision of vocational education\nto individuals who have completed or left high school and who are available for study in\npreparation for entering the labor market.\u201d This section was deleted from the United States\nCode under P.L. 105-332; however, references to this section remain in regulations at 34\nC.F.R. Part 600 and in the Federal Student Aid Handbook (ED,\nFSA Handbook, 2004-2005).\n17 For more information, see ED,\nFSA Handbook, 2004-2005, Institutional Eligibility,\nChapter 12.\nCRS-9\n2. If\nmore than 50% of an institution\u2019s courses are correspondence\ncourses, it\nloses its Title IV eligibility (HEA, \u00a7102(a)(3)(A)).18\n3. If\n50% or more of an institution\u2019s students are enrolled in\ncorrespondence courses, it\nloses its Title IV eligibility (HEA,\n\u00a7102(a)(3)(B)).19\nIt is important to note that the three 50% rules are applied in conjunction with\none another in determining institutional eligibility. Institutions not meeting the\nrequirements of either rule 2 or 3 are not eligible to participate in Title IV programs.\nThe first rule determines the application of rules 2 and 3.

Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (P.L. 101-392).\n19 This limitation may be waived for a two-year or four-year institution offering associate\u2019s\ndegrees or bachelor\u2019s degrees, respectively, if the students participating in the\ncorrespondence courses do not receive more than 5% of the total Title IV funds received by\nall students enrolled in the institution.\nCRS-10\nAccording to the first rule, as stated above, telecommunications courses are\nconsidered correspondence courses in instances where correspondence and/or\ntelecommunications courses constitute at least half of the courses offered by an IHE.\nTelecommunications courses also are considered to be correspondence courses if less\nthan half of the programs at an IHE lead to an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate\ndegree. The result from this first rule can affect the application of the other two 50%\nrules, which consider the proportion of correspondence courses offered at institutions\nand the proportion of students enrolled in them.\nAccording to the second rule, an institution loses eligibility to participate in\nTitle IV programs if the sum of its correspondence courses (including\ntelecommunications courses, if defined as such) exceeds 50% of the total number of\ncourses offered, regardless of the proportion of students enrolled in these classes.\nUnder the third 50% rule, an institution loses Title IV eligibility if 50% or more of\nthe institution\u2019s students are enrolled in correspondence courses, regardless of the\nnumber of the institution\u2019s courses offered via correspondence. In addition, if\ntelecommunications courses are considered correspondence courses under the first\n50% rule, certain DE students might lose eligibility to receive Title IV aid (as is\ndiscussed below), even if the institution as an entity remains eligible to participate\nin Title IV programs.\nIt should be noted that the 50% rules apply to\ninstitutions, not programs. Thus,\nan individual educational program could be composed entirely of correspondence or\ntelecommunications courses and still be considered an eligible program for the\npurposes of Title IV, assuming the institution does not run afoul of the 50% rules and\nthe program is otherwise eligible. Also, in order to maintain institutional eligibility\nfor FSA programs, institutions may decide to identify programs that do not lead to\na degree and that are offered solely through correspondence as non-FSA programs.\nIn such cases, the programs and the students enrolled in them do not factor into the\ndetermination of institutional eligibility.20\nStudent Eligibility\nEligibility for DE students to receive FSA depends on many factors including\n(a) the eligibility of the institution they attend to participate in FSA programs (with\nparticular respect to the application of the 50% rules); (b) the classification of their\nprogram of instruction; (c) their enrollment status; and (d) whether participation in\nDE affects the calculation of their cost of attendance (COA). The eligibility of\ninstitutions offering DE programs to participate in FSA programs was discussed in\nthe previous section. Factors that affect the eligibility of DE students to receive FSA\nare discussed below.\nTelecommunications and Correspondence Course Programs. In\ngeneral, for a student to be eligible to receive FSA, the student must \u201cbe enrolled or\naccepted for enrollment in a degree, certificate, or other program ... leading to a\n20 ED,\nFSA Handbook, 2004-2005, pp. 2-147 through 2-148.\nCRS-11\nrecognized educational credential\u201d at an eligible institution.21 For students enrolled\nin DE programs, eligibility to receive FSA depends on whether their program of\nstudy leads to a degree, a certificate, or a diploma and whether their courses are\nclassified as telecommunications or correspondence courses based on the first 50%\nrule (see\nFigure 2). Students enrolled in telecommunications courses are eligible for\nFSA if they are enrolled in a program leading to an associate, baccalaureate, graduate,\nor professional degree, or in a program of one year or more in length leading to a\ncertificate. Students taking telecommunications courses as part of a certificate\nprogram that is less than one year in duration are not eligible to receive FSA funds.\nStudents enrolled in correspondence courses are eligible for FSA if they are enrolled\nin a program leading to an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree.

For DE students, enrollment in correspondence\ncourses may determine their enrollment status for FSA purposes (i.e., full-time, three-\nquarter-time, half-time, or less-than-half-time), and affect their eligibility to receive\nFSA under certain HEA programs. (These limits are applicable only to\ncorrespondence courses and do not apply to telecommunications courses.)23 DE\nstudents who are enrolled\nonly in correspondence study may\nnot be considered\nenrolled more than half-time, regardless of the number of courses they are taking;\nhowever, students who combine correspondence and regular coursework may be\nconsidered enrolled more than half-time. (Under the DEDP this provision may be\nwaived, thus allowing students enrolled only in correspondence courses to be\nconsidered enrolled full-time.)24\nStudents\u2019 eligibility for FSA under certain HEA programs depends on their\nenrollment status. For example, students must be enrolled at least half-time to\nreceive aid under the Stafford and PLUS Loan programs.25 Students enrolled less-\nthan-half-time may be eligible for the Pell Grant and campus-based aid programs\n(Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Federal Work-\nStudy (FWS), and Perkins Loans); however, Pell Grant award amounts are calculated\naccording to formulas that take enrollment status into account.26 Institutions are\nrequired to award campus-based aid to students enrolled less-than-full-time in a\nproportion comparable to the extent that the institutions\u2019 funding allocations were\nbased on the financial need of such students.27\nFigure 3 shows how enrollment in\ncorrespondence courses may affect students\u2019 eligibility for FSA.\n23 However, as previously discussed, under the first 50% rule telecommunications courses\nare considered to be correspondence courses if more than 50% of the courses offered at the\ninstitution are either telecommunications or correspondence courses, or if less than 50% of\nits programs lead to an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree.\n24 U.S. Department of Education,\nStudent Financial Aid Handbook, 2004-2005, vol. 2 \u2014\nSchool Eligibility and Operation, Chapter 8; Distance Education, pp.2-157.\n25 HEA, \u00a7 484(b).\n26 For additional information on the Pell Grant program, see CRS Report RL31668,\nFederal\nPell Grant Program of the Higher Education Act: Background and Reauthorization, by\nJames B.

For DE students enrolled less-than-half-time or only\nin correspondence study, the amount of FSA they may be eligible to receive may be\naffected by limitations on what may be included in the calculation of their COA.28\nFor students enrolled less-than-half time, their COA may include only the costs of\ntuition, fees, books, supplies, transportation, and dependent care expenses.29 For\nstudents in correspondence study, their COA is generally limited to the costs of\ntuition, fees, books, and supplies. (However, for correspondence courses with a\nresidential training component, an allowance for travel, and room and board also may\nbe included in the COA.)30 Additionally, for students attending institutions\nparticipating in the DEDP, computer costs may be included in their COA.31\n28 In general, a student\u2019s COA is the sum of the following: (a) tuition and fees, (b) allowance\nfor books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses, including\ncomputer costs for students enrolled at least half-time, (c) allowance for room and board,\n(d) reasonable costs for approved study-abroad programs, (e) dependent care expenses, (f)\nreasonable expenses for students with disabilities, (g) reasonable expenses associated with\nemployment in cooperative education programs, and (h) FSA loan fees (HEA, \u00a7 472).\n29 HEA, \u00a7 472(4). This provision applies to all students, regardless of whether enrolled in\ntelecommunications, correspondence, or regular courses.\n30 U.S. Department of Education,\nStudent Financial Aid Handbook, 2004-2005, vol. 2\n\u2014\nSchool Eligibility and Operations, Chapter 8; Distance Education, p. 2-155.\n31 HEA, \u00a7 486(b)(2).\nCRS-14\nThe Distance Education Demonstration Program\nThe DEDP was created as part of the 1998 reauthorization of the HEA (P.L.\n105-244). The main purpose of the DEDP is to \u201ctest the quality and viability\u201d of\neducational programs that are relieved of some of the restrictions imposed by the\ninstitutional and student eligibility rules previously discussed. Under the DEDP, the\nSecretary may waive a number of statutory and regulatory provisions that might\nhinder the provision of DE courses and programs. IHEs, systems of IHEs, and\nconsortia of IHEs may participate in the DEDP. Having key provisions waived\nallows participants in the DEDP and students enrolled in DE courses to qualify for\nFSA.\nAs part of the DEDP, the Secretary may waive the following provisions of law\nand regulation:\n! The three 50% rules (HEA, \u00a7\u00a7484(l)(1), 102(a)(3)(A), and\n102(a)(3)(B));\n! The exclusion of computer costs from the calculation of COA for\nstudents enrolled in correspondence courses (HEA, \u00a7472(5));\n! The definition of \u201cacademic and award year,\u201d as it relates to the\nminimum number of weeks of instruction (HEA, \u00a7481(a));\n! The definition of \u201celigible program,\u201d as it relates to the minimum\nnumber of weeks of instruction (HEA, \u00a7481(b)); and\n! Any regulations promulgated by the Secretary under Part F \u2014 Need\nAnalysis, or Part G \u2014 General Provisions Related to Student\nAssistance Programs, that may inhibit the operation of quality DE\nprograms.32\nThe DEDP grew from nine participants in 1999 to 23 participants in 2003.\nDuring that time, the number of offsite students enrolled in these DE programs\nincreased from less than 13,000 to over 27,000 while onsite course enrollment\nincreased from 19,000 to over 42,000. In 2003, 17 individual institutions, four\nsystems, and two consortia were selected in a competitive process to participate in\nthe program. Participants were chosen to represent a variety of institutional sizes and\nmissions across the country as well as a variety of delivery methods. According to\nED\u2019s July 2003 report to Congress on the status of the DEDP:\nSixteen participants received waivers of the three provisions that relate to the\namount of correspondence education an institution eligible for the Title IV\nstudent financial assistance programs may provide (the \u201c50% rules\u201d). Seven are\ncurrently using these waivers to continue to participate in the Federal student aid\nprograms. Fourteen participants received waivers for provisions relating to the\nrequired length of a program and definition of a week of instruction (the \u201c12-\n32 HEA, \u00a7 486(b)(2).\nCRS-15\nhour rule\u201d).33 Seven received waivers of the definition of a full-time student as\nit relates to correspondence study, and three received waivers of the requirements\nrelating to satisfactory academic progress. Western Governors University\nreceived additional waivers, as provided in the authorizing statute, because of its\nunique structure.34\nThe Government Accountability Office (formerly the General Accounting\nOffice) has found that while existing Federal restrictions on schools offering DE\nprograms affect only a small number of schools, the number of affected schools is\nexpected to grow in future years. GAO reports that 14 schools (serving 225,000\nstudents) are either now or soon will be adversely affected the 50% rules. Thirteen\nof these schools participate in the DEDP and most have obtained waivers from the\n50% rules.35\nEffect of Waiving the 50% Rules. Two recent reports have considered the\neffects of the 50% rules on institutions and financial aid. According to ED\u2019s most\nrecent report on the DEDP submitted to Congress in July 2003,36 16 of the 23\nparticipating institutions, systems, and consortia37 received waivers from all of the\n50% rules. Western Governors University also received similar waivers as specified\nin the program legislation.38 Of the institutions that received waivers of the 50%\nrules eight, including Western Governors University, relied on the waivers to\ncontinue their eligibility to participate in FSA programs.39\nBased on this study, ED concluded that waiving these provisions for DE\nprograms resulted neither in increased incidences of fraud and abuse nor other\nnegative consequences.40 In addition, ED concluded that the financial viability and\nadministrative capability of an institution posed a much greater risk to the integrity\nof FSA programs than the mode in which instruction is delivered. ED also\nrecommended changing statutory language and regulations related to FSA to increase\nDE opportunities for students.\n33 On November 1, 2002, ED promulgated regulations eliminating the 12-hour rule,\npreviously codified at 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 668.2, 668.3, and 668.8 (\nFederal Register, vol. 67, no.\n212, pp. 67047-67083).\n34 U.S. Department of Education,\nSecond Report to Congress on the Distance Education\nDemonstration Program, 2003. Available at [http://www.ed.gov/programs/disted/\nsecondreport.pdf]. (Hereafter referred to as ED,\nSecond Report on Distance Education.)\n35 U.S. General Accounting Office,\nDistance Education: Improved Data on Program Costs\nand Guidelines on Quality Assessments Needed to Inform Federal Policy, Feb. 2004, GAO-\n04-279.\n36 ED,\nSecond Report on Distance Education.\n37 The 23 participants accounted for a total of 107 institutions.\n38 This institution was made eligible to participate in the DEDP through \u00a7 486(b)(3)(D).\n39 The other institutions had not expanded the size of their distance education programs to\nthe extent that they would have exceeded or were close to exceeding the 50% rules.\n40 ED,\nSecond Report on Distance Education.\nCRS-16\nGAO also has conducted a study of DE at the postsecondary level.41 This 2002\nstudy examined the factors that would need to be considered before changes were\nmade to existing statutory language or regulations that affect DE programs. GAO\nfocused on whether any changes would result in increased access to postsecondary\neducation or increased incidence of fraud and abuse, and how much it would cost to\nimplement the changes. GAO concluded that removing restrictions without some\nform of management accountability would probably increase occurrences of fraud\nand abuse. Suggested forms of accountability included continuing to allow\ninstitutions to request waivers and monitoring institutions that are granted waivers,\nor exempting institutions from restrictions based on specific criteria, such as student\nloan default rates. In terms of cost, ED has acknowledged that changing existing\nlaws and regulations to provide DE students with greater access to FSA, could\nincrease the cost of FSA programs. GAO recommended that ED study the cost of\nwaiving the 50% rules.\nAccreditation and Distance Education\nTo be eligible for Title IV programs, IHEs must be accredited by an agency or\nassociation recognized by ED as a reliable authority for assessing the quality of\neducation or training provided by that institution.\nThere are three major types of accrediting organizations:\nRegional accrediting organizations. These eight commissions operate in six\nregions of the U.S. and grant accreditation status to whole institutions, as\nopposed to individual programs. They accredit approximately 3,000 colleges and\nuniversities \u2014 over 97% of which are degree-granting, non-profit institutions.\nNational accrediting organizations. These organizations operate across the U.S.\nand accredit whole institutions. About 80% of the institutions they accredit are\nfor-profit (proprietary) institutions.\nSpecialized accrediting organizations. These organizations operate nationwide,\naccrediting programs and single purpose institutions. In many cases, a particular\nprogram at an institution (e.g., law program) may be accredited by a specialized\naccrediting organization, while the institution is accredited by a regional or\nnational accrediting organization.42\nFederal Recognition of Accrediting Organizations. The HEA\nspecifically states that an accrediting agency or association will only be recognized\nby ED if it:\n... consistently applies and enforces standards that ensure that the courses or\nprograms of instruction, training, or study offered by the institution of higher\n41 U.S. General Accounting Office,\nDistance Education: Growth in Distance Education\nPrograms and Implications for Federal Education Policy, 2002, GAO-02-1125T. Available\nat [http://www.gao.gov].\n42 Council for Higher Education Accreditation,\nProfile of Accreditation, Aug. 2003.\nAvailable at [http://www.chea.org/pdf/fact_sheet_1_profile.pdf].\nCRS-17\neducation, including distance education courses or programs, are of sufficient\nquality to achieve for the duration of the accreditation period, the stated objective\nfor which the courses or the programs are offered.43\nAfter ED determines that an accrediting agency or association should be recognized,\nit must then determine the scope of recognition. Section 496(n)(3) states that if an\naccrediting agency or association reviews institutions offering DE courses or\nprograms and meets the requirements of Section 496, its scope of recognition will\ninclude the accreditation of institutions offering DE courses or programs. Thus,\naccrediting agencies must have established policies for evaluating the quality of DE\ncourses or programs offered by an institution.\nStandards Used to Evaluate DE Programs and Courses. There are\nseveral challenges associated with evaluating and accrediting DE programs and\ncourses.44 Accrediting agencies traditionally have focused their efforts on evaluating\ninstitutions providing instruction in classroom-based settings. DE courses and\nprograms are offered through different modes of instruction, requiring accrediting\nbodies to evaluate the curriculum and instruction, faculty support, student support,\nand student learning outcomes of these programs in different ways. At the same\ntime, accrediting bodies must determine whether providers have adequate resources\nto offer a high quality program. Secondly, DE programs and courses are offered by\na variety of providers, ranging from traditional four-year institutions to online degree-\ngranting institutions to corporate universities. Accrediting bodies need to have\nstandards in place to address the accreditation needs of these different types of\nproviders. Thirdly, DE is often used for short-term continuing education and training\nin professional fields, distinct from a particular degree program. This challenge is\none that has not yet been addressed by many accrediting agencies, as most agencies\ndo not engage in reviews of short-term training programs, (which in general are not\neligible for FSA).\nAccording to the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), all eight\nregional accrediting commissions, for example, have established distance learning\nguidelines for institutions that operate within existing accrediting standards.45 The\nbest practices focus on five areas related to DE: (1) institutional context and\ncommitment; (2) curriculum and instruction; (3) faculty support; (4) student support;\nand (5) evaluation and assessment. Within each area, a description of elements\nessential to providing quality distance education courses and programs is included.\nThe regional accrediting commissions also have issued a formal statement regarding\ntheir commitment to quality distance education programs.\n43 HEA, \u00a7 496(a)(4).\n44 Council for Higher Education Accreditation,\nAccreditation and Assuring Quality in\nDistance Learning, CHEA Monograph Series 2002, no. 1.\n45 The best practices were based on work conducted by the Western Cooperative for\nEducational Telecommunications of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher\nEducation and completed in 1996. See Council for Higher Education Accreditation.\nCore\nAcademic Values, Quality, and Regional Accreditation: The Challenge of Distance\nLearning, 2000. Available at [http://www.chea.org/Research/core-values.cfm].\nCRS-18\nOther organizations also have developed indicators of quality distance education\nprograms. For example, the Institute for Higher Education Policy has developed a\nseries of 24 benchmarks specifically for evaluating internet-based distance\neducation.46 Several of the national accrediting organizations also have developed\nindividual standards, policies, or processes for reviewing distance education\nprograms and courses.\nGAO Study of Accreditation of Distance Education Programs and\nCourses. While accrediting agencies that review distance education programs and\ncourses must have established policies and processes for evaluating these courses or\nprograms in order to be recognized by ED, there is substantial variation in the extent\nto which this happens in practice. A recent study on distance education conducted\nby GAO specifically examined the issue of accrediting agency assessments of\ndistance education courses and programs.47\nThe GAO report examined the issue of accreditation from two perspectives: (1)\nthe extent to which accrediting agencies included distance education programs in\ntheir reviews; and (2) the extent to which accrediting agencies considered student\noutcomes in classroom-based programs and distance education programs. Of the\nseven accrediting agencies examined by GAO, all seven had policies and procedures\nin place for reviewing distance education courses and programs. There were\ndifferences, however, in the extent to which distance education programs were\nactually reviewed during assessments of the quality of an institution\u2019s educational\nprogram. For example, GAO found that some accrediting agencies do not review\ndistance education programs unless at least half of the institution\u2019s courses are\noffered by distance education, while others have set a 25% threshhold for reviewing\ndistance education programs.\nGAO also examined the extent to which student outcomes are considered by\naccrediting agencies in their evaluations of both classroom-based and distance\neducation programs. Accrediting agencies were examined based on three criteria\ndeveloped by GAO: \u201c(1) setting measurable goals for program outcomes, (2)\ndeveloping strategies for meeting these goals, and (3) disclosing the results of their\nefforts to the public.\u201d48 Only one of the seven accrediting agencies met all three\ncriteria with respect to evaluating DE programs.\n46 The Institute for Higher Education Policy,\nQuality On the Line: Benchmarks for Success\nin Internet-Based Distance Education, Apr. 2000. Available at [http://www.ihep.com/\nPubs/PDF/Quality.pdf].\n47 U.S. General Accounting Office,\nDistance Education: Improved Data on Program Costs\nand Guidelines on Quality Assessments Needed to Inform Federal Policy, GAO-04-279,\n2004. Available at [http://www.gao.gov].\n48 It should be noted that these are not criteria that accrediting agencies are required to meet\nby law or by ED. Rather, they are criteria developed based on GAO\u2019s experience in\nexamining how organizations focus on outcomes.\nCRS-19\nIssues for Reauthorization\nDuring the 109th Congress, it is likely that a number of bills will be introduced\nto amend and extend authorization for HEA programs. Given the substantial changes\nthat have occurred in the availability of communications technology and the demand\nfor DE courses since the 1998 HEA reauthorization, there are several important\nissues affecting DE that are likely to be debated as reauthorization is considered. Key\ntopics include whether to amend or extend the DEDP, whether to retain or amend the\n50% rules, whether to retain or amend the criteria used to determine institutional and\nprogram eligibility for proprietary and postsecondary vocational institutions that offer\nDE programs, and whether to revise the requirements regarding DE that accrediting\nbodies must adhere to in order to be recognized by ED.\nDistance Education Demonstration Program\nUnder the DEDP, IHEs offering programs through DE are able to have waived\na number of Title IV program requirements that might otherwise have made them\nineligible to participate in Title IV programs. (The specific provisions of the DEDP\nwere described earlier in this report.) During reauthorization, it may be debated\nwhether to retain the DEDP, to expand it to include more IHEs, or to amend specific\nprovisions of the HEA so that waivers under the DEDP would no longer be required.\nFor instance, requirements applicable to the disbursement of student aid funds\nare based on student participation in term-based, on-campus instruction. Existing\nrequirements may restrict federal aid to students participating in DE and may not be\neasily applied to DE programs. The amendments of 1998 partially addressed this\nissue through the creation of the DEDP. Congress may debate whether changes\nshould be made to the determination of student attendance status (i.e., full time or\npart time) based on the type of DE program in which the student is enrolled. In\naddition, Congress may consider the inclusion of room and board in the calculation\nof FSA for students participating in different types of DE programs.\nWhile the waiver of several requirements is available under the DEDP, the\nCongress may amend some of these provisions so that DE programs would become\neligible for FSA without the need for these waivers. A number of these areas are\ndiscussed below.\n50% Rules\nAs previously discussed, the 50% rules affect both institutional eligibility and\nstudent eligibility to participate in Title IV FSA programs. In the 108th Congress,\nlegislative proposals were introduced in the House and Senate that would curtail the\nscope of the 50% rules as they apply to DE. For example, proposals have been made\nto eliminate or amend the provision in the first 50% rule that leads to\ntelecommunications courses being considered correspondence courses in certain\nCRS-20\ninstances.49 Many of these proposals also would specifically make the other two 50%\nrules applicable only to correspondence courses. For purposes of determining\ninstitutional and student eligibility for FSA purposes, these proposals would in effect\ntreat courses offered through telecommunications in the same way as courses offered\nthrough traditional methods. The 50% rules would remain in effect for institutions\noffering courses through correspondence.\nThere is some debate about whether the 50% rules hinder IHEs\u2019 ability to meet\nstudent demand for DE programs and courses. If the rules were relaxed and there\nwas sufficient demand, increased numbers of students could begin taking advantage\nof DE programs and courses. This could result in increased costs to the federal\ngovernment if more students became eligible for FSA. Also, there may be some\nconcern that eliminating the 50% rules could result in increased incidences of fraud\nand abuse among eligible IHEs. A number of the proposals that would amend the\n50% rules, however, would also add new requirements applicable to the accreditation\nof DE programs, potentially as a means of assuring quality. This is discussed in\nfurther detail below.\nDE at Proprietary and Postsecondary Vocational Institutions\nUnder current law, proprietary and postsecondary vocational institutions must\noffer at least one \u201celigible program\u201d to be eligible to receive funds under Title IV.50\nA program is determined to be an eligible program if it is of a specified minimum\nlength. In the 108th Congress, several proposals were made to amend the definition\nof \u201celigible program,\u201d applicable to proprietary and postsecondary vocational\ninstitutions, so that it would also include specific references to programs offered\nthrough DE. Some proposals would define a DE program as an eligible program if\n(1) the program is an otherwise eligible program; (2) it is offered in whole or part\nthrough telecommunications; and (3) it is offered by an IHE that has been evaluated\nand determined by an accrediting body recognized by ED to have the capability to\neffectively provide DE programs.51\nAlternatively, other proposals would add a category to the definition of an\neligible program for non-correspondence DE programs, which it appears would be\ndistinct from the definition based on program length.52 A program offered\npredominately through DE methods and processes (other than through\ncorrespondence courses), would be an eligible program if the program has been\nreviewed and approved by a recognized accrediting body and if the IHE offering the\n49 See, for example, H.R. 2913, H.R. 3039, H.R. 4283, S. 901 and S. 1203.\n50 HEA, \u00a7 102. H.R. 3039 and H.R. 4283 would establish a so-called \u201csingle\u201d definition\nfor an IHE under \u00a7 101. Under these proposals, institutions offering at least one eligible\nprogram would generally become eligible to participate in all applicable HEA programs.\n51 See, for example, H.R. 3039 and H.R. 4283.\n52 For a discussion of current requirements, see CRS Report RL31926,\nInstitutional\nEligibility for Participation in Title IV Student Aid Programs Under the Higher Education\nAct: Background and Issues, by Rebecca R. Skinner, pp. 8-9.\nCRS-21\nprogram has not run afoul of certain financial and administrative requirements.53\nSome of these proposals would establish new criteria under which proprietary and\npostsecondary institutions offering DE programs could become eligible to participate\nin Title IV programs. These proposals would allow programs to qualify as \u201celigible\nprograms\u201d based on the means through which education is provided (i.e., DE), rather\nthan the duration of the program as is required under current law.\nAccreditation\nIssues related to accreditation may be debated as the HEA is considered for\nreauthorization. Proposals dealing with accreditation range from those that would\neliminate accreditation and preaccreditation requirements for institutional eligibility\nto those that would create additional requirements applicable to accrediting bodies\n\u2014 for example, expanding the scope of their recognition to include the evaluation\nof the quality of IHEs offering DE.54 With respect to DE, there are two major issues\nthat involve the accreditation of IHEs. These involve the standards applicable to the\naccreditation of DE programs and courses, and policies governing the transferability\nof credit from one IHE to another. The first issue is particular to DE, while the\nsecond issue is part of the larger debate about accreditation.\nUnder current law, \u00a7496 of the HEA specifies requirements for the recognition\nof accrediting bodies by the Secretary. With regard to accreditation, DE programs\nare currently treated in a manner consistent with education provided through\ntraditional means.55 Several bills have been introduced that would establish\nadditional requirements specific to DE for accrediting bodies seeking to have the\naccreditation of institutions offering programs through DE included within the scope\nof their recognition. Proposals include adding to the requirements of accrediting\nbodies specific provisions regarding the assessment of: student achievement for\nstudents enrolled in DE programs, the availability of resources and support services\nfor DE students, and the interaction between students and faculty in DE programs.\nIt appears that these proposals would establish a policy of treating programs\noffered through DE differently than programs offered through traditional methods.\nSome might argue (in light of GAO\u2019s findings) that DE programs are different\nenough from traditional education programs to require special review, while others\nmight be concerned that additional requirements are inappropriate and that they\namount to a new burden being placed on accrediting bodies.\nThere is also debate over the practice of some IHEs being selective in their\nrecognition of credits earned at other accredited IHEs when students seek to transfer\nfrom one IHE to another. For instance, some IHEs only recognize credits from IHEs\n53 See, for example, H.R. 2913 and S. 1203.\n54 See, for example, H.R. 838, which would eliminate accreditation and preaccreditation\nrequirements for institutional eligibility; and H.R. 2913, H.R. 3039, H.R. 4283, and S. 1203,\nwhich would create additional requirements for the recognition of entities accrediting IHEs\noffering programs through DE.\n55 See, for example, HEA, \u00a7\u00a7 496(a)(4) and 496(n).\nCRS-22\naccredited by specific types of accrediting agencies (e.g., regional accreditors). Some\nhave expressed concern as to why credits earned for a course taken at an IHE\naccredited by an agency or association recognized by the Secretary (and which may\nhave been paid for in part through FSA) would not be accepted for transfer by\nanother accredited IHE. Non-acceptance of transfer credits may be seen as inefficient\nfor the student, who may need to complete and pay for a second comparable course;\ninefficient for institutions, when seats are being filled by students re-taking courses;\nand inefficient for the federal government, if FSA is being used to support students\nre-taking courses in such instances.\nIn reaction to concerns such as these, proposals have been made to require IHEs\nto adopt policies stating that they will not deny students the transfer of credits from\nother IHEs that have been accredited by agencies or associations recognized by the\nSecretary, solely on the basis of the accrediting body.56 Some IHEs, however, view\nthis as eroding their autonomy in establishing their own academic standards. For\ninstance, the proposed policy could be viewed as prohibiting IHEs from having\npolicies regarding the acceptance of transfer credits that raise the bar above the\nminimum established by any accrediting body recognized by the Secretary. Even if\nsome accrediting bodies voluntarily established more rigorous standards for the IHEs\nthey accredit, IHEs accredited by those bodies would be prohibited from denying the\ntransfer of credit from IHEs held only to the minimum standards required by the\nSecretary, without going through a formal process of reviewing individual courses\nagainst an established set of objective criteria. Some suggest that such a review\nprocess would contribute to the escalation of college costs.57\n56 See, for example, H.R. 4283.\n57 Testimony of Barmak Nassirian, Associate Executive Director, American Association of\nCollegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, in U.S. Congress, House Committee on\nEducation and the Workforce,\nH.R. 4283, the College Access & Opportunity Act: Are\nStudents at Proprietary Institutions Treated Equitably Under Current Law? hearing, June\n16, 2004."

      "text": "You have /5 articles left.\nSign up for a free account or log in.\njacoblund/iStock/Getty Images\nAs online education grows as an option for college students, institutions are considering how best to accommodate students\u2019 mental health and wellness needs.\nRecent research from Uwill and the Online Learning Consortium (OLC) found 82 percent of faculty, staff and administrators who work with online students have seen an increase in demand for mental health support over the past academic year.\nThe survey, published May 30, found 54 percent of faculty and staff believe there\u2019s a lack of services tailored to online student needs, highlighting a need for additional resources that accommodate distance learners.\nOnline learners are often the overlooked group of students in higher education, says Uwill CEO Michael London, but online students are not a monolith and students will often transition between online to in-person learning in today\u2019s landscape, which makes it important for campus leaders to consider how best to serve them.\nMethodology\nThe survey was fielded online and the 338 respondents included faculty, student success support staff, academic advisers, institutional leaders, counseling staff and administrators from public, private nonprofit and private for-profit institutions. Respondents were from all 50 states and Washington, D.C. as well as 36 countries.\nSurvey says: The demand among online learners wasn\u2019t shocking to London, because it\u2019s part of a larger trend of mental health needs, he says, but really highlights how demand can put pressure on those who are not licensed professionals to provide care.\nSeven in 10 respondents say online students reach out regarding their mental health concerns either occasionally, frequently or very frequently. However, over one-third (37 percent) felt inadequately trained to recognize or respond to students\u2019 mental health issues.\nTreating students\u2019 mental health is \u201cnot what I, as a campus leader, would want faculty and staff to be doing,\u201d London says. Instead, campus leaders should focus on training faculty and staff to get students to the right place.\nFour in five faculty and staff say they have a high level of interest in receiving training on how to better support their students\u2019 mental well-being.\nThe greatest barrier to online students accessing supports, respondents say, is a lack of awareness of available services (58 percent), financial constraints and insurance coverage issues (46 percent) and limited appointment availability (44 percent), on top of a lack of services for this student population (54 percent) or a lack of services in general (45 percent).\nOne-third of campus stakeholders say they believe students are not satisfied with the mental health services offered by their institution.\nOnline student mental health in focus: A spring 2023 Student Voice survey from Inside Higher Ed, conducted by College Pulse, found 68 percent of students who take exclusively online courses (n = 80) experience chronic stress, 14 percentage points higher than the total response. Over half of these students say balancing school and other obligations is one of the biggest contributors to their academic stress in college, while the same rough number said exams are a contributor.\nOnline-only students were most likely to say stress is negatively impacting their ability to focus, learn and do well in school a great deal (39 percent) or somewhat (47 percent), compared to their in-person and hybrid learning peers.\nSo what? Based on the survey\u2019s findings, higher education practitioners and leaders can prioritize the following actions:\n- Build community for students. Compared to their peers who take some or all of their classes in-person, online learners are more likely to be isolated from their classmates and need additional help from the institution to get connected. Online learning communities or social media platforms can help build relationships among cohorts.\n- Check in with students. Sometimes it can be difficult for a staff or faculty member to know when an online learner is struggling because there\u2019s less face-to-face interaction. Institutions can utilize their data to become aware of those with additional needs, tracking assignment submission, LMS log-ins or meetings with support staff to gauge student health, London says. While not every online institution has robust mental health care, many provide wraparound coaching or mentorship support, which could translate into filling this need.\n- Invest in professional development. One in four online-only students say their professors have a responsibility to help with their mental health, according to Student Voice data. Campus leaders can support faculty and staff members in feeling more comfortable aiding students\u2019 well-being or referring them to a professional through training or certification opportunities.\n- Invest in digital mental health initiatives. While two-thirds of respondents in the Uwill survey say students have access to onsite counseling, only 39 percent said those same resources were available online. There are a variety of online providers who target college students and their experiences that can accommodate the competing priorities of online students. Having a service available also builds capacity of faculty and staff, says London, because they don\u2019t have to focus on those issues, but instead refer them to others.\nDo you have a wellness tip that might help others encourage student success?

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nMore than three years since the COVID-19 pandemic upended the higher education landscape, student enrollment in higher education is just leveling off following a period of double-digit declines. It's a continuation of a worrying trendline. Since 2010, 3 million fewer people than expected have enrolled in college, according to data compiled by the Sorenson Impact Center at the University of Utah. The combination of declining birth rates and a rapidly aging population means that colleges and universities face the potential for a perilous drop in the number of traditional-aged students who for years have been the backbone of higher education.\nThis \"demographic cliff\" represents an unprecedented challenge to higher education. Unlike in decades past, where students followed a linear path to and through higher education, today's college-going realities look very different. A group of learners has emerged, one that has often been overlooked by traditional higher education models. They are the \"and-ers,\" students who are simultaneously balancing education and work, education and parenting, education and deployment, education and caring for aging parents. The \"and\" list goes on. The defining characteristic of \"and-ers,\" however, is that education isn't always their first priority \u2014 and for good reason. Yes, they are students, but their identity is not defined by school alone.\nOver the past two decades, the \"and-ers\" have fast become the norm for students in higher education, regardless of age or educational background. According to data from the Georgetown University Center for Education and the Workforce from 2018, nearly 70% of all college students hold jobs, and nearly half of these working learners are putting in 15-to-35 hours per week. While these numbers are likely to have shifted in the years since this study, they offer a glimpse into the continued reality of working students. Though working while in school is often necessary to pay the rent and cover tuition, it can often take a toll on those who work to support themselves and cover the cost of college. More than half of students who work 15 hours per week or more end up with GPAs of C or worse \u2014 and students with poor grades often need more time to earn a degree and may struggle to graduate at all. The bigger question here, however, is whether their failure to thrive is more about their complicated contexts or our inability to offer policies, practices, models, and modalities that better meet their needs.\nTo serve \"and-ers\" well, colleges have to do more than just offer a little extra flexibility through night classes or online programs. Colleges must retool their educational offerings, programs, and support services to better serve this growing population. Colleges can help working learners succeed by providing flexible schedules, personalized pathways to degrees, stackable credentials, and wraparound support services. They can also work with employers to create partnerships that offer tuition assistance, job training, and career advancement opportunities. In doing so, they can create opportunities for these students to not just survive but thrive in their personal and professional lives.\nHigher education is already undergoing a healthy culture shift to meet these students where they are \u2014 and there are plenty of promising new models to show for it. Over the past decade, Northern Kentucky University has built and fine-tuned a work-based learning partnership with national nonprofit Education at Work. This program enables full-time students to gain professional experience working for Fortune 500 employers. The combination of hourly wages earned on the job \u2014 and tuition assistance benefits provided by the employers \u2014 substantially offsets the cost of college, while helping students develop valuable skills sought by employers after they finish college.\nWhile it's important to give students access to more meaningful types of employment opportunities, it's just as critical to support those who have existing jobs. City Colleges of Chicago, a large urban community college system, has built a homegrown support model in collaboration with nonprofit One Million Degrees to serve its students, many of whom are financially independent or work. This holistic support program blends academic and non-academic coaching services, apprenticeship opportunities, scholarship aid, and intensive academic advising to help striving students succeed.\nMeeting the needs of \"and-ers'' isn't just about work. It's about helping them to balance the complex array of \"and\" challenges. For example, Education Design Lab organized a \"Single Moms Success\" Design Challenge to mobilize community colleges that are finding new and innovative ways to make the higher education experience more inclusive for parents. National University (NU), where I serve as president, partners with nonprofit InsideTrack to deliver one-on-one success coaching that works holistically with each student to help understand their needs beyond the classroom and develop an education plan that works for them.\nThese are just a handful of examples of how colleges can support \"and-ers.\" The most successful colleges and universities of the future will be those that embrace the potential of what we at NU call \"whole-human education.\" It's about ensuring that every learner feels a deep sense of belonging that comes from knowing that their institution is not just a virtual or physical place for learning, but an ally that will fight with them to overcome obstacles and work with them to make the most of their educational journeys.\nRetooling higher education to meet the needs of working learners can help institutions survive and thrive in the years ahead. By doing so, they can help create a more equitable \u2014 and accessible \u2014 system of higher education that helps more \"and-ers\" cross the commencement stage."

      "text": "\"Contingent\u201d faculty positions include both part- and full-time non-tenure-track appointments.\n- Their common characteristic is that institutions make little or no long-term commitment to faculty holding these positions.\nToday, a large proportion of faculty appointments are part-time.\n- This includes positions that may be classified by the institution as adjuncts, part-time lecturers, or another name.\n- Many faculty in so-called \u201cpart-time\u201d positions actually teach the equivalent of a full-time course load.\n- Other part-time appointments are held by graduate student employees, whose chances of obtaining tenure-track positions in the future are increasingly uncertain.What is billed as a teaching apprenticeship often instead amounts to years of intensive, low-paid work that distracts from, rather than complementing, graduate studies.\n- To support themselves, part-time faculty often commute between institutions and prepare courses on a grueling timetable, making enormous sacrifices to maintain interaction with their students.\n- Since faculty classified as part-time are typically paid by the course, without benefits, many college teachers lack access to health insurance and retirement plans. Back to top\nBoth part-time and full-time non-tenure-track appointments are increasingly prevalent.\nContingent positions that are ineligible for tenure now account for nearly 70 percent of all instructional staff appointments in American higher education, including 49 percent part time and 19 percent full-time non-tenure-track. See more data here. Back to top\nThe majority of faculty working on contingent appointments do not have professional careers outside of academe, and most teach basic core courses rather than narrow specialties.\n- While a small percentage of part-time faculty are specialists or practitioners of a profession such as law or architecture and teach a class on the side, this situation is the exception rather than the norm.\n- In other words, contingent faculty are \"real\" faculty, not other professionals who are moonlighting by teaching a course.\n- Students at community colleges and in lower-level undergraduate courses are disproportionately taught by faculty on contingent appointments. Back to top\nThe excessive use of, and inadequate compensation and professional support for, faculty in contingent positions exploits these colleagues.\n- Positions that require comparable work, responsibilities, and qualifications should be comparably compensated.\n- As the AAUP recommended in 1993, compensation for part-time appointments should be the applicable fraction of the compensation (including benefits) for a comparable full-time position. Back to top\nThe turn towards cheaper contingent labor is largely a matter of priorities rather than economic necessity.\n- While many institutions are currently suffering budget cuts, the greatest growth in contingent appointments occurred during times of economic prosperity.\n- Many institutions have invested heavily in facilities and technology while cutting instructional spending.\n- Though incoming students may find finer facilities, they are also likely to find fewer full-time faculty with adequate time, professional support, and resources available for their instruction. Back to top\nMany contingent faculty members are excellent teachers and scholars.\n- But no matter how qualified and dedicated, faculty teaching in these positions are hobbled in the performance of their duties by a lack of professional treatment and support.\n- Many lack access to such basics as offices, computer support, and photocopying services. Back to top\nHeavy reliance on contingent faculty appointments hurts students.\n- Faculty working conditions are student learning conditions.\n- Faculty on contingent appointments are typically paid only for the hours they spend in the classroom. While they may be excellent teachers, they are not given adequate institutional support for time spent meeting with students, evaluating student work, and class planning and preparation.\n- Adjuncts are often hired on the spur of the moment with little evaluation or time to prepare--sometimes after a semester has already started.\n- Faculty in contingent positions often receive little or no evaluation and mentoring, making them especially vulnerable to being dismissed over one or two student complaints.\n- Faculty in contingent positions, though they may teach the majority of some types of courses, are often cut out of department and institution-wide planning. The knowledge that they have about their students and the strengths and weaknesses of the courses they teach is not taken into consideration.\n- The high turnover among contingent faculty members mean that students in a department may never have the same teacher twice, or may be unable to find an instructor who knows them well enough to write a letter of recommendation.\n- The free exchange of ideas may be hampered by the fear of dismissal for unpopular utterances, so students may be deprived of the debate essential to citizenship.\n- They may also be deprived of rigorous evaluations of their work. Back to top\nOveruse of contingent faculty appointments hurts all faculty.\n- The integrity of faculty work is threatened as parts of the whole are divided and assigned piecemeal to instructors, lecturers, graduate students, specialists, researchers, and administrators.\n- Proportionally fewer tenure-track faculty means fewer people to divide up the work of advising students, setting curriculum, and serving on college-wide committees.\n- Divisions among instructors create a less cohesive faculty; on some campuses, tenure-track and adjunct faculty rarely interact or participate in planning together.\n- Tenure should be a big tent that provides due process protections for the academic freedom of all faculty; where contingent appointments predominate, it becomes instead a merit badge for a select few. Back to top\nAcademic freedom is weakened when a majority of the faculty lack the protections of tenure.\n- The insecure relationship between faculty members in contingent positions and their institutions can chill the climate for academic freedom, which is essential to the common good of a free society.\n- Faculty serving in insecure contingent positions may be less likely to take risks in the classroom or in scholarly and service work. Back to top\nThe use of non-tenure-track appointments should be limited to specialized fields and emergency situations.\n- While we recognize that current patterns of faculty appointment depart substantially from the ideal, the AAUP recommends that no more than 15 percent of the total instruction within an institution, and no more than 25 percent of the total instruction within any department, should be provided by faculty with non-tenure-track appointments.\n- While institutions often cite \"flexibility\" for a reason to hire faculty off the tenure track, contingent appointments are often clustered in programs with very high levels of predictability--such as freshman writing courses that are required for all students. Back to top\nShared governance responsibilities should be shared among all faculty, including those appointed to part-time positions.\n- Curricular and other academic decisions benefit from the participation of all faculty, especially those who teach core courses.\n- Faculty and administrators should together determine the appropriate modes and levels of participation in governance for part-time faculty, considering issues such as voting rights, representation, and inclusion in committees and governance bodies. Back to top\nWhen contingent appointments are used, they should include job security and due process protections. Contingent faculty appointments, like all faculty appointments, should include:\n- the full range of faculty responsibilities (teaching, scholarship, service);\n- comparable compensation for comparable work;\n- assurance of continuing employment after a reasonable opportunity for successive reviews;\n- inclusion in institutional governance structures; and\n- appointment and review processes that involve faculty peers and follow accepted academic due process. Back to top\nThe proportion of faculty appointments that are on the tenure line should be increased. This can be done by:\n- Changing the status of faculty members currently holding non-tenure-track appointments. Individuals holding contingent appointments are offered tenure-eligible reappointments.\n- Creating new tenure-line appointments. New tenure-line positions are created and open searches are held for candidates to fill them.\n- In both cases, transition to a higher proportion of tenured faculty should be accomplished primarily through attrition, retirements, and, where appropriate \u201cgrandfathering\u201d of currently contingent faculty into tenured positions. Faculty in contingent positions should not bear the cost of transition. Back to top\nAdditional information about contingent faculty is available here."

As online learning moves from an experimental phase to an established institutional function, CHLOE documents steps to achieve stability, reliability, and consistency.\nSurvey Pool\nIn contrast to other surveys, CHLOE seeks the insight and perspective of the senior online officer at each participating institution in the belief that this individual has a unique vantage point from which to assess online learning at their institution.\nQM's Collaboration with Eduventures and EDUCAUSE\nIn 2016, Eduventures Research and Quality Matters formed a partnership to fill a gap in the research related to online education by focusing on how it is being carried out at postsecondary institutions across the United States. The first CHLOE Survey was conducted in 2016 and resulted In the 2017 CHLOE 1 Report. In 2023, EDUCAUSE joined Eduventures Research and QM to work on the CHLOE Project, beginning with CHLOE 9.\nUpcoming Surveys\nCHLOE 11 will continue to measure the way online learning reshapes the face of higher education in the future by surveying those managing this shift.\nParticipate in CHLOE Surveys >>\nThe Reports\nCHLOE 10 | Meeting the Moment: Navigating Growth, Competition, and AI in Online Higher Education\nOnline learning continues to reshape higher education; however, the 2025 report reveals that institutions are struggling to keep up. Facing a surge in interest, increased competition, impacts from AI, and a lack of institutional preparedness, the chief online learning officers (COLOs) surveyed for the report share the stark disconnect between growing student expectations and institutional preparedness.\nMajor takeaways from the tenth survey of U.S. COLOs on how their two- and four-year schools are managing online learning include:\n- Online learning demand continues surging with 74% of COLOs reporting increased graduate student demand, 66% seeing growth in adult undergraduate interest, and 60% noting rises in traditional-age students. The takeaway is clear: students increasingly expect flexible learning options to fit education into the tapestry of work, family and financial realities.\n- Investment in nondegree offerings, such as certificates, micro-credentials, and bootcamps is surging with 65% of COLOs reporting some or major investment in these programs, more than doubling from 29% in 2018-19, with community colleges leading this trend and positioning nondegree pathways as cornerstones of their online strategies.\n- While only 35% of COLOs consider AI very or extremely important today, 72% expect it to be within two years. At the same time, institutional AI strategy remains fragmented with just two-thirds working on strategies and 9% having no plan at all. Meanwhile, the digital divide persists as a barrier, with 21% of COLOs reporting it affects many students and 57% noting uneven AI tool access impacts learners.\nCHLOE 9 | Strategy Shift: Institutions Respond to Sustained Online Demand\nStudent demand for online and hybrid learning continues to grow, and institutions are working hard to find their footing in this post-pandemic environment. The deeper story is that institutions are reexamining their identities and priorities in light of this increased multi-modal demand.\nMajor takeaways from the ninth survey of U.S. chief online learning officers on how their two- and four-year schools are managing online learning include:\n- The preference for online modalities among U.S. learners continues to surge. Nearly half of COLOs surveyed indicated that enrollment in online degree programs at their institutions is now higher than that of on-campus programs.\n- More than half (56%) of COLOs indicated that their institutions have undergone a strategic shift in response to this demand. As overall enrollment continues to lag behind the post-pandemic years, this opportunity to reach more learners may be pivotal for institutional financial sustainability.\n- COLOs reported a wide variety of approaches for addressing the presence of artificial intelligence at their institutions. 35% of COLOs reported having AI-related policies; 32% of COLOs say that AI as a topic is taught to students; only 6% of COLOs said students are actively discouraged from using AI.\nCHLOE 8: Student Demand Moves Higher Ed Toward a Multi-Modal Future\nStudent demand for online and hybrid learning continues to grow, and institutions are working hard to find their footing in this post-pandemic environment. The deeper story is that institutions are reexamining their identities and priorities in light of this increased multi-modal demand.\nMajor takeaways from the eighth survey of U.S. chief online officers on how their two- and four-year schools are managing online learning include:\n- A majority of respondents report stagnant or declining enrollment among traditional undergraduates in face-to-face programs, and an even greater percentage say that the number of adult undergraduates and graduate students in these programs is declining.\n- Chief online officers report strong growth for fully online programs (36%) or hybrid programs (20%), and a greater percentage say adult undergraduate and graduate online and hybrid programs are growing.\n- Approximately half the respondents confirm that their present strategic plans and resource allocations support a greater emphasis on online learning and multi-modal study. An additional 36% indicate their institutions are reconsidering strategic priorities in light of student demand.\nCHLOE 7: Tracking Online Learning From Mainstream Acceptance to Universal Adoption\nIn the next few years, online learning will become a part of nearly every higher ed student\u2019s experience. That\u2019s one takeaway from the CHLOE 7 report, a joint project of Quality MattersTM and Eduventures\u00ae that offers an overview of the online learning landscape at higher education institutions. The report draws on survey responses from chief online officers at two- and four-year colleges and universities, who are uniquely situated to assess the current state of online education.\nSignificant takeaways from the in-depth report include:\n- A large majority of respondents predict that by 2025 most higher education learner experiences will include online learning.\n- Institutions can and should adjust their strategies and allocate more resources to online learning in response to student needs.\n- While quality assurance standards for online courses are in place, review processes for ensuring standards are met are lagging.\nCHLOE 6: Online Learning Leaders Adapt for a Post-Pandemic World\nThe COVID pandemic constituted a stress test on how online learning could respond to an externally driven emergency requiring its rapid expansion and how such an experience, encompassing the entirety of higher education, might change its scope, image and future direction. CHLOE 6 establishes that the pivot to remote learning increased the reach and accelerated the adoption of online learning, and increased the influence of chief online officers.\n- All sectors of higher education invested in ed tech in 2020 and 2021, amounting to the biggest investment jump ever. This included largely in-person schools that had not previously made significant investments in online learning-related technologies.\n- Two-thirds of surveyed institutions relied on their chief online officer to coordinate their institution\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including course conversion, faculty training, student preparedness, technology capability, and quality assurance.\n- When asked about future online undergraduate enrollment, only 13% of Chief Online Officers (COOs) expected the moderate growth seen in pre-pandemic years, while 77% predicted some or major acceleration in this trend.\nReport authors conclude that institutions would be well-advised to capitalize on the momentum or positivity generated by the pandemic\u2019s forced shift into fully-distanced learning.\nCHLOE 5: The Pivot to Remote Teaching in Spring 2020 and Its Impact\nCHLOE 5 is a departure from the previous four surveys and reports in its focus on a single issue \u2014 the impact of higher education's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it is having on the short- and long-term prospects of online learning.\nIn CHLOE 5, Chief Online Officers:\n- Identify the key challenges their institutions had to overcome during their pivot to remote instruction in spring 2020\n- Acknowledge the specific challenges involved in the pivot, while concluding the pivot was largely successful from the institutional, student, and faculty perspectives\n- Specify their priorities for quality improvement to remote instruction to get closer to true online learning should expanded online learning continue into fall 2020 and beyond\nA notable conclusion from CHLOE 5 is that although colleges may be announcing a return to the in-person classroom in the fall, their online officers are preparing for a term of improved remote study.\nCHLOE 4: Navigating the Mainstream\nThe number of participants in CHLOE continued to grow in this fourth year, up 31% from participation in CHLOE 3. Respondents to CHLOE 4 included 20 of the 60 Flagship schools in the U.S. (33%). Some surprising contrasts with other sectors emerge from a first look at Flagship institutions.\nCHLOE 4 added a sixth type to the list of models used to categorize the way institutions manage online education: Flagship - The leading 4-year public universities, with research and public service roles, as designed by their home states and recognized by the Association of American Universities, with fewer than 7,500 fully and partly online students.\nCHLOE 4 continued coverage from the earlier CHLOE surveys and found, for example, that use of OPMs doubled from 12% to 24% between 2017 and 2019. It confirmed findings from the earlier reports, such as the finding that \u201centerprise\u201d institutions \u2014 those that already have the largest online enrollments at more than 7,500 fully and partly online students \u2014 have the most aggressive plans for program expansion and that the course development process is largely internal, with heavy dependence on faculty and less consistent involvement of instructional designers.\nCHLOE 4 dug deeper with more open-ended questions about issues such as long-term institutional goals and the relationships of chief online officers with other senior administrators. The top three goals for online education over the coming five years listed by chief online officers were improving quality, increasing enrollment and adding courses and programs.\nCHLOE 3 Report: Behind the Numbers\nCHLOE 3 broke new ground in identifying a number of different institutional approaches to online learning, as crystalized in the descriptions of five models (Enterprise schools, Regional Public and Regional Private 4-Year schools, 4-Year schools with Low Online Enrollment, and Community Colleges). Major themes in CHLOE 3 include a more complete picture of the growth, prevalence, and scope of the Chief Online Officer position; the emergence of online committees and councils as a component of institutional shared governance; associations between online course structure, student engagement and outcomes; and the widespread neglect of coordinated blended learning.\nCHLOE 2 Report: A Deeper Dive\nCHLOE 2 (survey issued in 2017) saw participation increase by 75% over the CHLOE 1 (2016) Survey. The larger sample confirmed major findings of the first survey on such mainstream issues as: widespread perceptions that online learning is a revenue generator, increasing competition, and reliance on institutional budgeting processes to meet the needs of online learning. This report delves into more detail than that of the CHLOE 1 Report with a focus on the motives behind the choices made by leaders of online programs.\nCHLOE 1 Report\nThe 2017 CHLOE Report, \u201cThe Changing Landscape of Online Education,\u201d establishes baseline information on important trends in the management of online learning, current and emerging tools and methods in the field, regulation and accreditation challenges, and quality assurance activities. The CHLOE Survey, upon which the report is based, sets the stage for wider discussion of these issues."

      "text": "In recent days, I\u2019ve been reflecting on my time as a policy advisor to the United States House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce in 2003, when we wrestled with how and whether to waive Department of Education regulations to aid in the growth of distance education. How could we balance vital consumer protections, and the responsibility of safeguarding federal aid, with the promise of connecting an unprecedented number of students with vital education and training through online modalities?\nMembers of Congress resisted expanding the Distance Education Demonstration Program (DEDP), or even memorializing in statute what the demonstration program was teaching us about how students and institutions were experimenting with promising new technologies. At that time, policymakers were concerned about maintaining quality and ensuring academic integrity. Equity and access concerns were paramount. Many of the institutions participating in distance education at that time were also for-profit providers and policymakers had a level of increased scrutiny about their motivations.\nFast forward seventeen years, and policymakers and institutions are again grappling with the promise and the peril of moving higher education online. We know that an institution\u2019s transition to online education is neither quick nor seamless. It takes intense coordination and planning among administrators, faculty and instructional designers. Students\u2019 transition to online learning (even for digital natives) is not without challenges either. Many students\u2014like the ones profiled by Digital US, a national coalition of 25 community organizations and employers working to support digital skill development\u2014struggle with consistent access to devices, internet, or tech support, and are unfamiliar or uncomfortable learning online.\nTo explore how the challenge of moving online is playing out on-the-ground across a range of contexts, I\u2019m going to spend the next few weeks sharing the perspectives of a college president, a faculty member, a nontraditional education provider, and current student as part of a multi-part series on the role of online learning in higher education.\nTo start, I visited with Dr. Becky Takeda-Tinker, president of Colorado State University - Global Campus (CSU-Global) about the challenges and opportunities that exist for institutions as they transition to an online learning platform in the middle of a pandemic.\nAlison Griffin: What challenges might campus leaders and faculty face as they attempt to quickly stand up courses and programs in the coming weeks?\nBecky Takeda-Tinker: We know that the one-size-fits-all learning environment doesn\u2019t work in a physical classroom setting, and it certainly isn\u2019t effective in an online learning environment. Today\u2019s students are accustomed to a smart phone that is user-friendly, provides on-demand access to information, helps them stay organized, is continually improving and upgrading in the background, and actually learns from their behavior \u2014 so that is their expectation of what technology-mediated learning should be, as well.\nMoving courses or programs to online-delivery systems can be done in numerous ways, depending on the preferences and abilities of the instructor. We find the myriad pathways to implementing technology-based education are not that different from the diverse ways that teachers can teach in a face-to-face environment. In other words, teachers drive the learning through their thoughtful lesson plans and course structures, and technology tools facilitate it while the organization\u2019s overall environment supports both students and teachers.\nFor online education, some educators will post presentations and syllabi leaving students to download and review the information on their own, while others will use video conferencing to teach classes in real-time. And then others may utilize specially-designed learning platforms that can host interactive multimedia learning activities to facilitate self-paced educational environments, or provide a virtual learning environment that includes a combination of techniques\u2014the permutations of online education possibilities is truly endless.\nHowever, it is the primary goal of educators to engage and retain students as they move towards course and program completion. Consequently, it is their responsibility to determine the most effective online course composition or framework needed for their particular type of students. This is based on their institutional mission, the student demographics, and student needs as well as various learning styles and different course subject areas. That accountability requires that an institution\u2019s online education courses, programs and environments be highly intentional, especially given that technology-based education can track and measure multiple factors regarding student engagement, class participation, learning achievement and satisfaction.\nGriffin: How does an \u201cemergency\u201d transition to online differ in your mind from a planned online instructional format?\nTakeda-Tinker: During this pandemic, we hear that institutions across the nation are moving themselves \u201conline in a matter of days,\u201d which in most cases is actually just providing remote access to learning materials as assignment submission. It is likely to result in a variety of outcomes, since these programs have not been created with the intentional planning, thought, tools, content and interactivity needed to provide an engaging environment for today\u2019s students.\nUnderstandably, while trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by closing their physical campuses, leaders and educators don\u2019t have a lot of other options if they are trying to help students complete their course for the semester, so this \u2018emergency transition\u2019 has great merit. However, as we move past this phase of a quick-solution and into more permanent adoptions of online learning as an alternative learning modality, strategic planning by each organization and educator will be important. Institutional leaders have a rare opportunity to not just follow what has been done in the past or what their peer institution may be doing, but to thoughtfully plan how their campus utilizes online educational models to truly engage and serve their unique student populations with programs, tools, services and faculty and support staff.\nGriffin: How can faculty replicate the best of in-person teaching through an online modality?\nTakeda-Tinker: We have found that educators who try to replicate their in-person teaching techniques in online environments often need assistance in adapting their expertise to effective online instruction. Providing specialized training for instructors and academic leaders so they can understand the environment and student-centered culture, and meet the needs of learners through online modalities is paramount. And to keep them apprised, aligned and comfortable with new technology tools, it is important to provide, on an ongoing basis, online training courses on the many new tools that various faculty groups have selected for integration into the learning environment each year.\nAdditionally vital to the student online learning experience is the construction of the courses themselves. In the case of CSU-Global, our program faculty leaders are academic and industry experts in their areas so as they plan their courses, they draw upon the insights of industry leaders to identify learning outcomes that align with industry needs. Based on the identified learning outcomes for their courses and programs, our academic leaders then collaborate with curriculum development teams of instructional designers, multimedia experts, content experts, project managers and quality assurance reviewers who work together to map out the learning components, technical tools, learning aids and exercises, grading rubrics and student engagement techniques that blend together to create courses and programs.\nOur educational courses and programs are truly cooperative initiatives that draw upon team members\u2019 respective expertise to design and teach online classes that engage our students while they acquire the skills and knowledge they need for workplace success and academic achievement. So while we may teach at a distance through virtual and technological means, through data-driven outcomes, we have demonstrated that online learning can provide even better outcomes because of that level of intentionality and group-based expertise.\nGriffin: What concerns do you have about the rush to online education in response to COVID19?\nTakeda-Tinker: My concerns, and those of the CSU Global staff and faculty, lie in the student experience. I understand the need of institutions and faculty across the world to quickly move their classes to an online environment, and I applaud their courage to make that leap at a time of few options. However, we are concerned that the rush to just upload learning materials and assignments to a learning platform will provide students with an incomplete perspective of the positive learning experience that strategic and intentional online learning courses and programs can offer.\nI started in online education with CSU Global in 2008, and there have been so many new advancements in technology-based tools and offerings that really change the way that people can learn efficiently and effectively. And with data provided on learning achievement that runs in the background of online learning platforms, it would pain me to see the embrace of online learning pushed back a decade due to poor or ineffective learning experiences. The industry of technology-based learning has advanced exponentially in a positive direction and I\u2019m hopeful that students across the globe have the opportunity to experience the optimal learning environment we are all capable of now providing."

      "text": "Community colleges receive much less funding per student than public four-year institutions, even though they serve a greater proportion of students who are underrepresented in higher education and who may need additional programs and supports to be successful. Research shows that per-student spending by colleges is directly related to student outcomes and that a lack of resources is a major impediment to community college effectiveness.[1] Better resourced institutions have higher retention and attainment rates, among Black and Latinx students in particular.[2][3] But community colleges often lack the resources to implement reforms that research has shown lead to better and more equitable outcomes.\nThere is wide variation in state policy contexts, governance structures, and funding mechanisms among community colleges. More than half of their public funding comes from state and local governments, and while federal funding has increased in recent decades, state funding has fallen.[4] The large infusion of federal dollars during the pandemic\u2014as well as debate over increasing the federal role\u2014has made effective federal funding policy even more critical.\nTotal Revenue for Community Colleges, by Source, Fiscal Year 2017\nWhat the Research Tells Us\nCommunity colleges operate with substantially fewer resources for core academic and student support functions than public four-year institutions.\n- Public two-year colleges[5] receive less than half the revenue for education-related purposes per full-time-equivalent student of public four-year colleges ($8,700 vs. $17,500).[6]\n- Community colleges that serve the most disadvantaged populations receive the fewest dollars per student.[7]\nAlthough the federal government invests heavily in higher education, the lion\u2019s share of this funding does not flow to community colleges.\n- In fiscal year 2017, community colleges received 18% of their revenue from the federal government, 33% from the state, 17% from tuition and fees, 20% from local sources, and the rest from self-supporting operations and other sources.[8]\n- Most federal funding for higher education goes toward financial aid to students and research grants, not operating funds.[9] Many community colleges get no federal grants.[10]\n- In fiscal year 2017, federal spending on major higher education programs, including student aid, totaled $75 billion. State spending was $87 billion, and local funding (mostly to community colleges) was $10.5 billion.[11]\n- Community colleges receive about 19% of the Title III funding allocated to Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) ($114 million of the total $590 million), though nearly 40% of MSIs are community colleges.[12] Community colleges receive 42% of the Title V funding for Hispanic-Serving institutions.[13]\n- Public two-year colleges receive $329 million of about $1 billion in funding from the Department of Labor for workforce and apprenticeship programs.[14]\nCOVID-19 relief funding has helped community colleges continue to operate during the pandemic. The funding formula has evolved to better account for the population of students at community colleges.\n- Higher education institutions and their students have received substantial help from the federal government through the CARES Act (March 2020), the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (December 2020), and American Rescue Plan Act (March 2021).[15] In total, the three relief packages provide $76.2 billion to higher education institutions to defray COVID-19 related expenses, carry out student support activities, and provide financial grants to students.[16]\n- About $19.3 billion of this federal support has been allocated to public two-year colleges; about $34.7 billion has been allocated to public four-year colleges. Under CARES, public two-year colleges were allocated about 31% of the total for public colleges; under CRRSA and ARP, they were allocated about 37%.[17] About 38% of undergraduates at public colleges attend two-year colleges.[18]\n- The CARES Act funding formula used full-time-equivalent (FTE) students to measure the size of the student population (and low-income student population), depressing funding levels for community colleges relative to four-year colleges, as community colleges serve many more part-time students. The funding formula for the second and third relief packages counted full- and part-time students, boosting funding for community colleges.[19]\nKey Considerations for Federal Policy\n- Allocating funding by the number of low-income students and by the number of both part-time and full-time students, as was done under the CRRSA and American Rescue Plan Acts, can be a model for providing federal funding to community colleges in the future.\n- The federal government should consider grant opportunities that help community colleges make improvements to core instruction and student services functions that are backed by evidence.\nEndnotes\n- ^ Deming, D.

      "text": "Kameshwari Shankar watched for years as college and university courses were increasingly taught online instead of face to face, but without a definitive way of understanding which students benefited the most from them, or what if anything they learned.\nAs an associate professor of economics at City College in New York, Shankar knew that one of the most important requirements of scientific research was often missing from studies of the effectiveness of online higher education: a control group.\nThen came the Covid-19 pandemic, forcing almost everyone on earth online and creating a randomized trial on a planetary scale with a control group so big, it was a researcher\u2019s wildest dream.\n\u201cThe pandemic and the lockdown \u2014 that\u2019s a great natural experiment,\u201d said Shankar. \u201cA gold mine of evidence,\u201d a study she co-authored called it.\nNow the results of this experiment are starting to come in. They suggest that online higher education may work better than pre-pandemic research showed, and that it is evolving decisively toward a combination of in-person and online, or \u201cblended,\u201d classes.\n\u201cFor two years we\u2019ve had sort of a petri dish of experimenting with learning online,\u201d said Anant Agarwal, chief platform officer of the online program management company 2U and former CEO of edX, the online provider created by MIT and Harvard and sold last year to 2U for $800 million. \u201cNow people are sitting down and saying, \u2018Let\u2019s take a breath. Let\u2019s see what worked and didn\u2019t work.\u2019 \u201d\nAbout a third of higher education was entirely online before the pandemic, and the rest continued to be delivered face to face in brick-and-mortar classrooms, according to the research company Bay View Analytics. The huge spike that occurred during the peak of lockdowns propelled not only unprecedented innovation and investment in online higher education, but also a spree of research into whether and how well it works.\n\u201cInitially when we were doing that research it was always on the class or the course level and very rarely were you able to see how online education worked across programs and across institutions,\u201d never mind across the world, said Michael Brown, assistant professor of higher education and student affairs at the Iowa State University School of Education.\nRelated: How higher education lost its shine\nThere were 236 papers presented with the word \u201conline\u201d in their titles at this year\u2019s meeting of the American Educational Research Association, compared to 158 the year before the pandemic \u2014 a nearly 50 percent increase. Felice Levine, the association\u2019s executive director, likened these projects to the real-time, rapid-response studies of the impact of natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina.\n\u201cThis is action research on steroids!\u201d a university administrator enthused in a survey, referring to a type of scholarship that examines an activity in progress.\nMuch of the pre-pandemic research into online higher education concluded that students in online programs did worse than students in in-person courses, with lower grades, higher dropout rates and poorer performance in subsequent classes. On average, outcomes were especially bad for men, Black students and students who had fared poorly in their earlier educations.\nBut many of these studies suffered from what scholars describe as self-selection bias, said Shankar \u2014 in this case, the fact that people who chose to take courses online also shared other inherent characteristics, skewing the results.\nStudents who enrolled in online programs before Covid tended to be older and studying part time, for instance, and often had jobs and families. \u201cWe would expect a part-time student with other obligations to perform less well,\u201d Shankar said.\nDuring the pandemic, the variety of students learning online \u201cabsolutely increased,\u201d said Di Xu, an associate professor of higher education and public policy at the University of California, Irvine, who began doing research into online learning before Covid. That makes it easier to objectively determine \u201cwho seems to benefit and who struggles the most,\u201d Xu said.\nShankar and others have been combing through the massive amounts of newer information generated during the pandemic, when learning online was largely no longer a choice, eliminating self-selection bias. \u201cWe are optimistic that the post-pandemic data will show more favorable outcomes,\u201d she said.\nAlready, in surveys conducted at City College, Shankar and her co-authors have found that online instruction appears particularly effective in large introductory classes with 100 or more students, since those students can use chats and virtual feedback to raise questions they aren\u2019t able to ask in giant, impersonal lecture halls.\nStudents in small elective classes like it less, saying there is too little opportunity for face-to-face discussion.\nRelated: A handful of colleges are finally providing training in a way consumers want it: fast\nAnother study has found that providing required courses online helps students graduate more quickly, often because in-person versions of the courses are full or unavailable.\nStudents in general are also at least somewhat more interested in learning online now than they were before the pandemic. That\u2019s the consensus of roughly 75 percent of university chief online officers in the Changing Landscape of Online Education, or CHLOE, survey by the nonprofit Quality Matters and the higher education consulting firm Eduventures. College and university students will all now be online for at least part of their educations, these administrators almost unanimously say.\nNot everyone loved online learning during the pandemic \u2014 especially in the early stages, when it was at its most haphazard. Nearly three in 10 students in a Strada Education survey in the fall of 2020 said their ability to learn was much worse online than in person.\nEven now, acceptance is lukewarm, emerging research shows.\nOnly about a third of Americans say they are \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cdefinitely\u201d confident about the quality of online courses, another Strada survey found. Forty-seven percent of students and 43 percent of faculty members give online education an A for meeting their educational needs, according to Bay View Analytics.\nBut 57 percent of students are more optimistic about classes that are entirely online than they were before Covid. Nearly 99 percent of the university chief online officers in the CHLOE survey expect an increase in online instruction, up from 70 percent who expected one before Covid.\n\u201cFor two years we\u2019ve had sort of a petri dish of experimenting with learning online. Now people are sitting down and saying, \u2018Let\u2019s take a breath. Let\u2019s see what worked and didn\u2019t work.\u2019 \u201d\nAnant Agarwal, chief platform officer, 2U\nAs for faculty, even if only 43 percent give a top grade to online higher education, in Agarwal\u2019s opinion, that\u2019s a win. \u201cReally what happened during the pandemic is people tried it for the first time and many of them liked it,\u201d he said. That has resulted in \u201ca much bigger leap than in the normal course of evolution.\u201d\nAnother thing that\u2019s taken a big leap is blended learning, combining such things as short videos and frequent, computer-graded tests with in-person classroom lectures and discussion. Though it\u2019s been practiced for a while, there\u2019s now widespread consensus that online higher education, at least for undergraduates, will largely take this form.\n\u201cWhat we have now is an unprecedented agreement about the direction of higher education, in terms of teaching mode, that we have never seen before,\u201d said Jeff Seaman, director of Bay View Analytics, who has tracked this field since 2003.\nRelated: Impatient for workers, businesses help students take college shortcuts\nBy last year, more than half of all faculty said they \u201cagreed\u201d or \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d that they wanted to combine online with face-to-face instruction, a Bay View Analytics survey found. A Harvard University task force found that 82 percent of faculty there were interested in adding digital tools they adopted while teaching remotely to their in-person classes.\nThat number likely includes many faculty who, before the pandemic, stuck to fully in-person teaching, Brown, of Iowa State, said. \u201cThen this terrible thing happened that forced people to try online education who would have probably resisted it for another decade. If there is a takeaway that\u2019s clear now, it\u2019s that the shift in teaching culture has opened folks up to technology more.\u201d\nAgarwal said the pandemic also exposed bad practices, such as online-only classes that consisted almost exclusively of very long lectures.\n\u201cThe world has not gone back to zero, but has settled somewhere in the middle where we\u2019re coming into a blended future,\u201d he said.\nMore than four out of five institutions built up their technical teams during the pandemic to support online learning, and are offering more faculty training programs in it, the CHLOE survey found \u2014 an infrastructure that will likely stick around.\nSome scholars caution that the unprecedented nature of the pandemic could complicate research as much as self-selection bias did before it started. Faculty and students had to juggle outside stress, for instance.\n\u201cYou have all of these factors going on with the pandemic affecting everything from personal health to family members\u2019 health to employment,\u201d said Cassandra Hart, an associate professor of education policy at the University of California, Davis, who is studying the effect of the pandemic on higher education.\nAdded Xu: \u201cThe shift to remote instruction due to the pandemic was accompanied by so many other things that changed at the same time. It\u2019s really difficult to tease out the impact of instruction.\u201d\nOnline higher education also took so many forms \u2014 from professors lecturing over Zoom to sophisticated multimedia courses developed by professional instructional designers \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to generalize about.\nRelated: Momentum builds behind a way to lower the cost of college: A degree in three years\n\u201cThe variability is massive,\u201d Seaman said. \u201cI just see too many people lumping all of this stuff together, and you can\u2019t do that.\u201d\nBut Shankar said all of those varieties of online learning offer more, not less, opportunity for study. \u201cThat would be another gold mine of evidence,\u201d she said: \u201cnot just online versus traditional, but also within online what works and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nOne finding that has emerged from the pandemic could have the greatest effect of all on online higher education: Nearly half of employers said their opinion of the quality of online credentials has improved, according to a survey by the Northeastern University Center for the Future of Higher Education and Talent Strategy.\nStill, since so many students who participated in it haven\u2019t yet applied for jobs or even graduated, conclusively measuring the effectiveness of online learning will take time. The academic semester now under way, researchers say, is a first test of new methods and acceptance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take years for us to really be able to see, out of the things coming out of the pandemic, what works well, what works well in some settings and what works well for some students and not for others,\u201d Hart said.\nThis story about online higher education was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

  "argos_summary": "Nearly nine in ten colleges plan to expand online programs, reversing a 1990s policy that capped digital courses, but most institutions are unprepared for the surge in demand, especially for graduate, adult, and traditional students.  The CHLOE surveys reveal gaps in AI strategy, faculty development, and student support\u2014particularly mental health services\u2014while community colleges face significant funding shortfalls that limit their capacity to meet the needs of the most vulnerable learners.  Historical policy debates around the 50% rule and the Distance Education Demonstration Program illustrate how regulatory barriers have been lifted, yet institutional readiness remains uneven, echoing past challenges of scaling distance education.  To sustain growth and equity, higher education must invest in comprehensive AI plans, strengthen faculty and student support, and reallocate resources to community colleges and other underfunded institutions.",
