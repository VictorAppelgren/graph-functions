It was not a minor, though,\u201d she told Pirro, noting that \u201cit\u2019s happened to a lot of people in our building, sadly.\u201d\n\u201cHe was homeless and half-dressed \u2013 clearly wasn\u2019t in his clear mind,\u201d Phillips said of her attacker.\nThe former CNN journalist said she felt her best option was to fight back.\n\u201cIt was scary as hell, I\u2019m not going to lie, but I fought back. I didn\u2019t see any weapons in his hands. I felt like it was my only choice,\u201d Phillips recalled.\nTrump fumed Monday that DC has been \u201covertaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people.\u201d\nThe president vowed that his administration is \u201cnot going to let it happen anymore,\u201d and will remove homeless encampments from all public places, including in parks and underpasses.\nThe latest data from DC\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department shows violent crime has dropped 26% in the district so far this year, compared to 2024.\nOverall crime is down 7% so far, according to MPD.\nTrump claimed Monday that the numbers were \u201cphony\u201d and promised that Attorney General Pam Bondi will be \u201clooking into that.\u201d\nThe president noted that a DC police commander was suspended last month for allegedly falsifying crime data to make trends appear more positive.\nPirro, in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, described DC as an \u201cincredibly violent area\u201d with a crime problem that is so \u201chorrific\u201d that residents have stopped reporting some of it altogether.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got here are people that are not even making complaints about the quality-of-life crimes, whether it\u2019s shoplifting or damaging property or an attempted carjacking,\u201d the DC US attorney said.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even call the police,\u201d Pirro continued, arguing that \u201cwe\u2019re not even seeing most of the crime that\u2019s occurring.\u201d\nThe former New York district attorney and Fox News host also argued that the reason Trump\u2019s press conference announcing the DC crime crackdown was \u201cso packed\u201d is because many journalists, like Phillips, have been the victims of crime in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\u201cThose reporters in that room \u2013 and it was packed to the gills \u2013 experience crime themselves,\u201d Pirro said."

George Allen and again by ex-Gov. Bob McDonnell.\nHis son filed for divorce from Cara in January 2025, court records show. Peter admitted to the affair in his response to Cara\u2019s allegations in her own documents.\nThe estranged couple was hitched in 2014 and have two daughters, ages 2 and 9, and two sons, ages 5 and 7, court papers show.\nThey have a prenup agreement.\nCara is seeking half of their marital assets \u2014 including from their companies \u2014 child support and $500,000 to pay lawyers and experts as she fights the divorce case, the filings show.\nThey currently share custody of their children after working out an agreement on that front in Feb. 27, 2024, the filing says.\nA rep for Cara and a representative for Peter separately declined to comment.

He threw sunscreen at our boat trying to wake us up,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was running up and down, naked, screaming, \u2018Do something!\u2019\u201d\nSuffolk County police said the bystanders tried to resuscitate the popular designer before first responders arrived \u2014 but it was too late and Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra was pronounced dead.\nThe 911 caller and his pal, regulars at the yacht club, did not recognize Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra.\nThe blue-eyed beauty hailed from the small town of Carlow, just over 50 miles outside Dublin, she said in an interview last year with the Irish Independent.\nStudious and driven to succeed, she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration and management from University College in Dublin and went on to earn a master\u2019s degree in digital marketing at the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate School of Business, also in Dublin, in 2014.\n\u201cI always knew I wanted to be successful, that I was money-driven, business-driven, and that fashion is a tough industry and it would be a slow road,\u201d she told the Independent.\nAt just 26, she was vice president of client experiences for an Irish-based retail marketing agency \u2014 and bored with her career, she told the outlet.\nIn 2021, she launched East x East and a fashion accessories company, Duper.\nThe companies\u2019 success was enough to allow Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra to spend her summers in the Hamptons, where she was able to mix business with pleasure.\nRyan\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a lawyer for Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra was not on file."
