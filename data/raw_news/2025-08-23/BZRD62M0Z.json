  "title": "Concern That Gamified Investing Targets Emerging Adults To Be Gamblers",
  "description": "Mental health experts are voicing concern that gamified investing combines the risks of gaming and gambling to lure young adults into investor trading at a disadvantage",
  "content": "Mental health experts have voiced concerns about possible negative effects of gaming and gambling on traditional-aged college students and emerging adults. For example, in a 2020 study in the journal of Depression and Anxiety, which included over 40,000 undergraduate students across the nation, ten percent of students reported that computer gaming/problematic internet use had a negative impact on their academic performance, and that this use was associated with mental health symptomatology. In addition, a 2023 study in the journal of HealthCare summarized how gambling among college students is associated with poor academic performance, violence, substance use, mental health symptoms, and even suicide.\n\nDespite that gaming and gambling are often separated, gamified investing appears to combine aspects of these domains, and some mental health experts fear that gamified investing targets emerging adults who typically don\u2019t have the same level of financial literacy as seasoned traders. Thus, young traders might be vulnerable to consequences that could impact their mental health, well-being, and livelihood.\n\nAccording to a 2023 article on Nasdaq.com, gamified investing occurs when financial platforms and trading apps integrate game-like elements, such as rewards for completing trades, competition, badges, and leaderboards. According to this article, the purpose of gamified investing is to utilize the principles found in many video games to better engage users and to motivate their investment activity. The article noted possible risks of this type of investing, such as increased financial risk-taking and fostering a short-term mindset.\n\nIn 2024, TheConversation.com, an online platform of articles written by academic and research experts, released a report on the popularity of gamified investing apps and the potential risk for young investors. According to this report, gamified investing is effective in attracting young investors, and it encourages a casino-like experience that could encourage emerging adults to chase large financial payouts. This report also noted potential benefits of gamification techniques, such as price notifications that make it easier to correct mistakes. However, the report argued that financial institutions need to decide if they would rather empower a new generation of investors or simply turn young investors into gamblers.\n\nPossible Impact Of Gamified Investing On Mental Health\n\nAccording to a 2025 report on IV-capital.com, critics of gamified investing argue that it focuses on emotional decision-making and behavior that increases volatility as well as the potential for significant financial loses. Such factors could have a negative impact on the mental health of emerging adults. As stated, many emerging adults have low financial literacy in terms of investor trading, and there\u2019s concern that this could be a risk factor. For example, a 2020 report on Frobes.com discussed how a young investor died by suicide after seeing a $730,000 negative balance in a trading app. According to this report, the balance may not have represented uncollateralized indebtedness, but rather a temporary balance before the assigned stocks settled into the account.\n\nA 2022 report by the Financial Conduct Authority also expressed concerns about problematic behaviors linked to gamified trading apps. According to this report, gamified investing can lead to gambling-like behavior among investors. Furthermore, a 2025 report by the International Finance Student Association argued that gamified investing can stimulate the release of dopamine in the brain, which can result in addictive compulsions to keep investing.\n\nIn conclusion, emerging adults should make responsible decisions while engaging in investor trading. Part of this decision-making is being informed about the unique impact of gamified investing. As stated above, there are noted benefits to these types of investments. It\u2019s interesting to note that a 2024 study in the journal of BioMed Central Public Health found positive effects of gamified interventions on digital apps that promote mental health prevention. Thus, gamification can also be a powerful tool in promoting mental health outcomes among emerging adults.",

      "text": "The rise of investing apps and platforms has introduced a new trend: the gamification of investing. By borrowing techniques from video games\u2014like achievements, leaderboards, and rewards\u2014these tools aim to make investing more engaging and accessible. While this innovation has democratized financial markets, allowing more people to participate, it has also sparked debate. Does gamification empower individuals to take control of their financial futures, or does it encourage risky, impulsive behavior?\nHow Gamification is Changing Investing\nGamification employs psychological triggers to make investing more appealing. Platforms like Robinhood and eToro use colorful interfaces, push notifications, and real-time feedback to keep users engaged. Features such as confetti animations for trades, social trading communities, and challenges create a sense of achievement and competition, turning what was once seen as a complex, intimidating process into an interactive experience.\nThis approach has undeniably broadened access to investing. Many users who might never have opened a brokerage account are now actively buying stocks, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies. By simplifying the process and eliminating barriers like high fees or complex user interfaces, gamified platforms are helping a new generation of investors enter the market.\nThe Downsides of Gamification\nDespite its benefits, gamification has a darker side. Critics argue that it can turn investing into a form of entertainment rather than a thoughtful, goal-driven process. The use of game-like mechanics can encourage frequent trading and risk-taking, behaviors that often lead to poor investment outcomes. For example, rewards for completing trades or notifications highlighting trending assets can push users toward speculative investments without fully understanding the risks.\nAdditionally, the emphasis on short-term gratification clashes with the long-term nature of investing. While seasoned investors focus on strategies like diversification and compounding, gamified platforms often steer users toward instant rewards, undermining sound financial principles.\nAnother concern is the potential for emotional decision-making. Features designed to evoke excitement or urgency can cloud judgment, leading users to buy or sell based on hype rather than research. This behavior not only increases volatility but can also result in significant losses for inexperienced investors.\nFinding a Balance\nThe gamification of investing isn\u2019t inherently bad\u2014it depends on how it\u2019s implemented and used. Platforms that educate users while gamifying the experience can strike a balance between engagement and responsibility. For instance, incorporating educational content, tools for risk assessment, and reminders about long-term goals can help investors make more informed decisions.\nUsers also bear responsibility for their actions. Understanding the psychological effects of gamification is crucial for avoiding impulsive behavior. Setting clear financial goals and sticking to a disciplined strategy can help counteract the urge to treat investing as a game.\nThe Future of Gamified Investing\nAs gamified investing continues to evolve, its impact on financial markets will likely grow. Regulatory bodies are starting to scrutinize platforms for potentially harmful practices, and companies may need to strike a better balance between engagement and ethics.\nFor individual investors, the key is awareness. By recognizing the benefits and risks of gamification, you can use these platforms as tools for empowerment rather than entertainment. Whether gamification helps or hurts ultimately depends on how we choose to engage with it."

      "text": "- Research\n- Open access\n- Published:\nEffectiveness of gamified digital interventions in mental health prevention and health promotion among adults: a scoping review\nBMC Public Health volume 24, Article number: 69 (2024)\nAbstract\nBackground\nThough still a young field of research, gamified digital interventions have demonstrated potential in exerting a favourable impact on health and overall well-being. With the increasing use of the internet and digital devices, the integration of game elements presents novel opportunities for preventing mental disorders and enhancing mental health. Hence, this review aims to assess the effectiveness of gamified interventions focusing on preventing mental disorders or promoting mental health among adults.\nMethods\nBased on a scoping review across four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and Web of Science), 7,953 studies were initially identified. After removing duplicates and screening titles, abstracts and full texts, 16 studies were identified as suitable for inclusion in a narrative synthesis of findings. We included interventional studies encompassing an intervention and a control group aiming to investigate the effectiveness of the use of gamified digital mental health interventions and the use of gamified digital elements.\nResults\nOverall, positive effects of gamified interventions on mental health-related outcomes were identified. In particular, beneficial consequences for psychological well-being and depressive symptoms were observed in all studies. However, further outcomes, such as resilience, anxiety, stress or satisfaction with life, showed heterogenous findings. Most game elements used were reward, sensation and progress, whilst the quantity of elements was not consistent and, therefore, no substantiated conclusion regarding the (optimal) quantity or composition of game elements can be drawn. Further, the outcomes, measurements and analyses differed greatly between the 16 included studies making comparisons difficult.\nConclusion\nIn summary, this review demonstrates the potential of integrating digital game elements on mental health and well-being with still a great gap of research. A taxonomy is needed to adequately address relevant game elements in the field of mental health promotion and prevention of mental disorders. Therefore, future studies should explicitly focus on the mechanisms of effect and apply rigorous study designs.\nBackground\nThe mental health of individuals is affected by a variety of determinants on different levels such as individual or social factors, economics and culture, as well as living and working conditions, environmental and biological factors [1]. In 2016, about 16% of the global population was affected by mental or addictive disorders [2]. The most common mental disorders are depression (prevalence per 100,000: 3,627) and anxiety disorders (prevalence per 100,000: 3,715) [2]. In 1990, the global prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders was about 12.7%, proving them to be the most common mental disorders for at least 30 years [3]. Moreover, within the COVID-19 pandemic the prevalence has considerably increased in most countries [4]. Nochaiwong et al. [5] have also indicated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global prevalence of mental health problems among the general population.\nFor counteracting these challenges, digital technologies may be supportive. At the moment, the whole health sector is undergoing a monumental shift: Digital technologies are shaping the present and the future of health care. Additionally, the interest in online health information continues to grow. Along with the growing use and relevance of the Internet worldwide (2005: 1 billion; 2022: 5.3 billion) [6], the increasing relevance of digital applications and media results in new possibilities and potentials for health promotion and prevention, especially in terms of mobile and web-based applications [7]. Moreover, the digital transformation reveals changes on a social, organisational and individual level [8]. For targeting changes on those levels, innovative digital methods and concepts such as gamification have been utilized increasingly. Gamification is defined as the utilization of game-design techniques and elements outside of a game-context to positively impact user behaviour [9, 10]. The game elements cannot always be clearly separated, but largely refer to typical characteristics of a game [9]. In contrast to serious games \u2013 which we do no focus upon in this contribution \u2013, it is not about the complete game, but about playful elements. Positive effects on health and well-being through gamification have been observed [11,12,13,14,15]. Thus, e.g., Johnson et al. [11] identified within their systematic review that the majority of studies found positive effects on health and well-being through gamified elements. In addition, Bostock and colleagues [15] found within their randomized controlled trial a significant positive association with gamification and well-being, likewise with stress. Further, in an multi-centre interventional study, gamification has been proven to be an effective strategy for prevention of diseases and helps reducing expenses in prevention [16]. Thus, gamified interventions can induce behaviour change by improving self-determination and self-management skills [17]. In addition, continuous use of such applications increases also the satisfaction and self-esteem [18]. Overall, gamification seems to be an effective strategy to promote health. Previous reviews already investigated gamified interventions and the effect on mental health [11,12,13,14]. However, current literature has not comprehensively focused on prevention and health promotion [11,12,13]. Previous research such as by Six et al. [13] examined the effectiveness of gamification in mental health apps to reduce depression symptoms of adults, regardless of whether they are sick or not. Cheng et al. [14] in turn analysed which game elements and mental health and well-being domains are most commonly utilized and targeted in interventions of gamification for mental health and well-being. In this respect, further research is required in terms of whether and how gamified digital interventions can promote mental health and prevent mental disorders among adults.\nIn this context, we consider two research questions to be relevant: How effective is the use of gamified interventions, measured by relevant indicators for improving mental health or preventing mental diseases, for working-age adults? And secondly: Which game elements are most commonly used within the interventions identified?\nMethods\nOriginally planned as a systematic literature review, we performed a screening in four major databases, namely MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, PsycInfo and Web of Science. The primary objective was to identify intervention studies featuring at least one control condition that have been published between 2010 and 2022. The search was executed in January 2023. To ensure consistency and comparability, we used the following complete search algorithm, based on similar reviews [11, 14]:\n-\n\u201cmental health\u201d and \u201cwell-being\u201d were included as terms with positive connotations since well-being was seen as a mental health-related outcome in this study;\n-\n\u201cmental disorders\u201d and \u201cmental illness\u201d as terms with negative connotations;\n-\nand \u201cdepression\u201d as well as \u201canxiety\u201d as the most common disorders in this context. These two indications were chosen due to their high prevalence and importance in the field of mental disorders as already described in the background section, but also other indications were included if identified by the search algorithm.\nThus, the following search strategy was utilised:\n(gamif* OR game* OR playful*) AND (mental health OR wellbeing OR (mental illness* AND prevent*) OR (mental disorder* AND prevent*) OR (depress* AND prevent*) OR (anxi*AND prevent*))\nThe database search yielded a total of 7,953 records, of which 3,024 duplicates were removed. The study selection process started with the screening of titles and abstracts. Two authors (LA and PAS) independently carried out the initial title and abstract screening, which led to an interrater-agreement of 96.4%. In case of inconsistency a third party (FF or KW) screened those abstracts. The screening of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 4,871 studies. The screening of references of systematic reviews identified within the database search and studies included in the full text screening has not led to further hits. Subsequently, two authors (LA and PAS) independently appraised the full-texts against the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1) and any discrepancies (n = 8) were resolved by consensus. Finally, the full text screening for the remaining 58 records resulted in 16 included studies (see Fig. 1).\nResults are presented in accordance with the PRISMA statement [19]. Due to the high heterogeneity of studies, we were unable to compare effect estimates as originally planned. For that reason, we decided to shift the systematic literature review to a scoping review for synthesizing the results. We extracted information on the study design (e.g., sample size, drop-outs, number and time of follow-ups, primary and secondary outcomes as well as scales for measuring these outcomes) and intervention (e.g., country where the study was conducted, duration and characteristics of intervention and control group). For the latter, we additionally prepared a documentation of game mechanics based on the studies by Toda et al. [20] and Hervas et al. [21] to investigate the use of game elements in mental health promotion and prevention. Thus, the following game elements were included: Reward, Sensation, Progress, Challenges, Surprise, Storytelling/Narration, Social sharing, Level, Leaderboard, Goals, Avatar. For an explanation of the elements used in this study, see supplementary material. The results are described as a qualitative overview, allowing for a systematization of the outcomes and categorization of game elements.\nAn assessment of the methodological quality of the included randomized controlled studies was conducted by two authors (LA and FF) independently. The assessment was based on the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized studies (RoB2), which also allows to assess the quality of cluster-randomized studies [22]. No discrepancies in assessment were observed.\nResults\nA total of 16 studies were identified and included in the synthesis on the effectiveness of gamified digital interventions on mental health prevention and promotion among adults (Table 2). The measurements, statistical analyses and outcomes differed greatly; however, all studies showed overall a positive impact on mental health outcomes in at least one related outcome measurement.\nCharacteristics of primary studies\nOverall, four studies originated from the United Kingdom (UK), three each from Australia and New Zealand, two from the Netherlands, one from Portugal and one from the United States of America (USA). One study included participants from eleven countries; for another study, the location could not be determined. In most studies, generally healthy working-aged adults were observed (n = 13), while some focused specifically on university students (n = 3). Overall, 3,585 participants were included in the studies, with higher percentage of women (62%). The duration of the interventions ranged from 10 min (one break) up to 12 weeks, with most studies lasting four to six weeks (n = 8). Moreover, the majority of the studies provided an active control condition (n = 12). Of those active control conditions, five studies included access to meditation guides, the provision of information or the filling out of diaries. Further, other active interventions, such as similar applications to the intervention group or apps based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), were visible in four studies. Other comparison groups framing the same intervention just the other way around, or the same intervention with another design or layout (n = 3). Seven studies had a waitlist or inactive control condition (without any intervention). While most studies were two-armed, four studies used a three-arm design. All studies identified used randomization for allocation to the groups). A comprehensive overview of the interventions, including their used psychological techniques or strategies, can be found in the supplementary material.\nOutcomes investigated within primary studies\nA broad variety of outcomes investigated within the selected studies was observed. Beyond measuring various dimensions of well-being (n = 7), the studies also analysed resilience (n = 4) and mindfulness (n = 1). In addition, stress (n = 6), depression (n = 5) or anxiety (n = 5), as well as other mental health outcomes (n = 11) such as satisfaction with life, quality of life, or positive and negative affect were examined within the included studies. Due to the large number of different outcomes, the measurement instruments used were highly heterogeneous. Even for the same outcome, various instruments were used (Table 3). A detailed overview of the outcomes examined can be found in Table 3, while all included outcomes within the studies are presented in the supplementary material.\nEffectiveness of gamified digital interventions\nResilience and mindfulness\nIn total, four studies included resilience and one study mindfulness. While significant effects were found with respect to resilience for most studies, one of the four studies measuring resilience did not show significant improvements [29]. Moreover, the study by Flett et al. [29] also failed to identify any significant effects on mindfulness.\nWell-being\nOverall, seven studies investigated well-being within their studies. Most of these studies showed significant positive effects through game-based interventions. The general well-being significantly improved in five studies [25, 26, 28, 31, 37], while all studies examining psychological or mental well-being (n = 5) found significant improvements [15, 28, 33, 34, 36]. Spiritual well-being (n = 1) [28], interpersonal well-being (n = 1) [34], community well-being (n = 2) [28, 34], and economic well-being (n = 1) [34] showed also significant progresses through a game-based intervention. In contrast, for occupational well-being no significant effects could be observed [34]. Physical well-being was significantly improved in one study [28], while no effects could be observed in another [34].\nStress, depression, and anxiety\nIn total, six studies examined stress and five studies each anxiety and depression. There is some evidence suggesting that game-based interventions have significant positive effects on (psychological di-)stress (n = 3) [15, 23, 35]. With regard to the internalizing mental health problems, positive effects on depression (n = 5) [26, 29, 30, 35, 36], and anxiety (n = 3) [33, 35, 36] were observed. Results related to stress were very mixed, with three studies showing significant improvements [15, 23, 35] and three other studies without significant effects [27, 29, 31]. All studies used different scales. The results regarding anxiety are similar: Three studies reported significant positive effects, while two studies could not identify any significant improvements. In contrast, all interventions had a significant positive impact on the prevention of depression regardless of the measurements used.\nOther mental health outcomes\nNext to the mental health outcomes reported, a diverse array of emotional outcomes could be identified within eleven studies. Flourishing partly used as a proxy for well-being, was investigated in two studies. However, no significant results were identified [29, 30]. Three studies examined satisfaction with life and one study quality of life, while findings are heterogeneous. Using the same satisfaction with life scale, two studies detected significant improvements [23, 35], while one study did not [30]. Meanwhile, quality of life was significantly improved within two gamified interventions [25, 35]. However, one study did not show any significant improvements [37]. Personal growth (= 1) [33], sleep problems (n = 1) [37], emotional cognition (n = 1) [36], frustration and irritability (n = 1) [27], cognitive engagement (n = 1) [32], cognitive and affective engagement (n = 1) [32], energetic arousal (n = 1) [24], and recovery (n = 1) [24], were identified in one study each and had a significant association with gamified interventions. At the same time, positive and negative affect, sometimes used as proxy for well-being, were included in three studies as a combination and in one study separately. Accordingly, there was a significant association for positive and negative affect visible in two studies [30, 32]. Interestingly, Howells et al. [30] reported significant improvements for positive affect but not negative affect. In turn, Schakel et al. [37] could not identify any significant effects, neither for negative nor for positive affect (Table 3).\nGame elements within primary studies\nIn total, eleven game elements were applied within the studies included in this review. The most frequently utilized elements were reward (n = 11), progress and sensation (n = 9), followed by challenges (n = 6), surprise (n = 5) social sharing and storytelling/narration (n = 4). Less frequently used were avatars, goals, leaderboards and levels (n = 2) (Fig. 2). Overall, at least three game elements were integrated in the interventions, while Kelders et al. [32] used most game elements (n = 6).\nRegarding the use of gamification, an analysis of the elements shows great variations. For example, Routledge et al. [36] showed with the integration of progress a significant improvement in psychological well-being. At the same time, Myers et al. [34] demonstrated that an integration of four elements (Challenges, Progress, Social sharing, and Sensation) also improve psychological well-being. Moreover, when integrating challenges exclusively, significant improvements for well-being and depression were observed but not for anxiety [26]. Costa et al. [25] pointed out, that the integration of four elements (Challenges, Storytelling, Social sharing, and Sensation) similarly improve well-being.\nQuality appraisal of included studies\nOverall, the studies showed some or high risk of bias, particularly due to deviations from the intended interventions or missing outcome data. In contrast, the randomization only led to low risk of bias in most of the studies. There was a study which showed only low risk for all five dimensions, whereas one study showed high risk in four dimensions and some concerns in terms of the randomization process (Fig. 3).\nIn addition to this quality assessment, we have extracted the drop-out rates. Drop-outs varied from 0 to 67.0% per study. Four studies did not report on drop-outs, and two studies attributed the drop-out explicitly to technical issues. Most studies performed per-protocol analysis or are based on complete data. Only three studies conducted both an intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis; one further study performed an intention-to-treat analysis merely.\nDiscussion\nThis scoping review investigated the effects of gamified digital interventions in mental health promotion and prevention of mental diseases among working-age adults. Further, it investigated which game elements were most commonly used. Overall, positive effects of gamified interventions on mental health were identified, in particular on psychological well-being and depressive symptoms. However, further outcomes indicated heterogenous findings. Most game elements used were reward, sensation, and progress. However, due to missing information in the primary studies, no substantiated conclusion about the (optimal) quantity or composition of game elements in an intervention can be drawn.\nAccording to our research, this is the first scoping review which investigates the effectiveness of gamified digital interventions on mental health in adults of working age from a health promotion and disease prevention perspective. Previous reviews which, however, did not concentrate on health promotion and disease prevention, underline our findings in a very general way [11, 12, 40, 41]. However, when interpreting the results in the context of mental health, one needs to take into account that we explicitly focussed on persons who showed no mental impairments and, therefore, people who have high scores on a well-being scale and low scores on a depression scale. These floor or ceiling effects may \u2013 in contrary to treatment in mentally ill persons \u2013 only lead to a limited room for improvement. For that reason, one should not merely focus on statistical significance, but also on effect sizes. However, also small effect sizes may be considered as relevant.\nWhen interpreting the overall results, several further aspects need to be considered. First, the intervention period is relatively short in all included studies. Only two studies had an intervention period of 12 weeks [28, 32]. Five studies of four weeks, or 30 days respectively [23, 26, 27, 34, 36], and four studies of only ten days or less [24, 29,30,31]. There are indications that interventions with longer duration are more effective than those of shorter length [[31], e.g. [26, 30, 34]]; e.g. interventions with a duration of more than one month did not show non-significant results in mental health-related outcomes [e.g. [15, 25, 33]]. Moreover, taking into consideration that half of the studies did not have an active control group [15, 23, 31, 35,36,37], the findings need to be interpreted with caution. The inactive control group can be compared with the intervention group, however, in these cases no assertion can be made if the gamified intervention is more effective compared to a non-gamified intervention.\nAlthough it has to be acknowledged that all intervention studies included in the synthesis used randomization for allocation purposes, high dropout rates in the majority of the studies should be kept in mind. Drop-out rates might be higher in health promotion and disease prevention than in treatment, due to low psychological strain and lower motivation [42]. However, only four studies conducted an intention-to-treat analysis to avoid systematic error caused by drop-outs.\nMental health is influenced by numerous risk and protective factors that interact with each other [43]. In this respect, different determinants, such as social conditions, working or living conditions, could influence the effectiveness of game elements in terms of well-being. Myers et al. [34], for instance, found a statistically significant relation with income as well as community and economic well-being. Thus, high-income earners were 2.34 times more likely than low-income earners to comply with the programme. These effects \u2013 as already described by Dahlgren and Whitehead [44] \u2013 was taken up in a model on digital determinants of health equities [45]. Beyond that, it might be interesting to examine a person\u2019s individual characteristics in the context of gamification. It is thereby possible that e.g., personality, level of knowledge, experiences or even level of motivation, may influence the effectiveness of an intervention. As an example, interventions could be more effective for individuals who already enjoy playing games in their free time [46]. Since too little information on other variables was provided, no conclusive statement regarding these indicators can be drawn.\nAs a matter of fact, a (long-term) impact of an intervention is one of the most important aspects. The longest follow-up in the included studies was 12 months [26]. Other longest follow-up periods were 12 weeks [35], 60 days [34], 30 days [29], and four weeks [37]. However, most studies do not report follow-up measurements. For this reason, none of the studies investigated whether well-being is increased in the long term or whether intrinsic motivation is maintained. This aspect is a key element in the health care sector. Plugmann [16] emphasizes that gamification can help to reduce costs in the field of prevention. The authors argue that new products and services with gamification can lead to a breakthrough as an innovative prevention strategy. Thereby, however, it is a prerequisite that individuals are willing to share their data. A survey examining the usage of big data and in relation the protection of the privacy indicated that two third of respondents believed that too little attention is paid to the enforcement of data protection and that it will therefore fail. On a positive note, however, the healthcare industry has the highest level of trust compared to other industries, at over 20% [47]. None of the studies included investigates the aspect of cost savings and trusts in digital interventions. In this respect, a long-term view of cost savings and the presentation of the tolerance level when opening private data is an important aspect that could be decisive for the success of gamified interventions in mental health.\nLimitations\nThere are some limitations which have to be taken into account when interpreting the results. First, the included sample covers a wide age range. We focused on people in the working age group (18\u201365), whereas young individuals have different habits and needs compared to, for example, individuals nearing the age of retirement. Accordingly, a differentiation of age would be necessary in order to address the effectiveness more specifically. Along these lines, the whole age range was not included in any of these studies. Participants in the study of Costa et al. [25] for example, had a mean age of 73 years, which is attributable to their inclusion criteria (study population should be 50 years or older). Thus, participants above the maximum age of 65 years were included. In addition, some studies focused on university students, with a mean age of e.g. 21.48 years in Keeman et al. [31] and 22.8 years in Kelders et al. [32]. So, within this review, no differentiation of age groups was done. It is therefore critical to consider whether the sample was defined too broadly or whether a differentiated presentation is necessary.\nSecond, about half of the studies comprised small sample sizes of fewer than 100 participants [23,24,25, 27, 31, 32, 37]. However, some studies investigated more than 300 participants [33,34,35,36], whereas Firestone et al. [28] counted actually 794 participants. The heterogeneous number of included participants was not taken into account and thus no weighting of the results was performed. Due to this and the heterogenic target sample, the generalisation of findings is limited.\nThird, a limitation arise from the lack of comparability of the studies, as different survey and evaluation instruments were used. For instance, the overall well-being counts four different scales for four measurements. Similar observations were made for stress, depression, and anxiety.\nFourth, all studies reported at least one significant result. This might be an indication of publication bias.\nFurthermore, a variety of statistical analyses were used. This results in a fifth and major limitation. Ratings were presented as a plus (significant positive effect), if one out of various analysis found a significant impact. Since the analysis were very heterogeneous, no differentiation between the analysis and the number of significant results has been made. Therefore, the conclusion about the strength of the effects is limited.\nSixth, several studies used HeadSpace as a gamified intervention [15, 23, 24, 27, 29, 31]. Thus, due to the high number of studies based on the HeadSpace, the variety of gamified interventions is limited, resulting in a potential for bias as this intervention and its effects are given a higher weighting.\nSeventh, the usage of game-based elements is diverse and no constant findings were observed. In some cases, especially concerning HeadSpace, the elements used are not described clearly, and different wordings are used. Thus, findings addressing these elements are insufficient, which indicates the need to a well-developed categorization or taxonomy for game elements to make clear statements about the number, type, and combinations of elements which are effective for promoting mental health and preventing mental diseases.\nFinally, the quality assessment revealed some or high risk of bias, which must be taken into account when interpreting the results. Although we decided to not only focus on randomized controlled trials, but to include all studies with a control condition, all studies used randomization for allocation. The study quality is heterogeneous, but not that bad as one might expect from experiences of digital interventions in the previous decades. Therefore, as more studies become available, a more detailed perspective on study design and statistical analysis should be considered.\nConclusions\nThere is evidence of the effectiveness of digital game elements in improving mental health among working-age adults. However, findings are still limited, and results are heterogeneous, which can be traced back to the different interventions and designs applied within the included studies. A variety of eleven elements was used, and it was not clear whether some features or combinations are more important in the context of mental health promotion and prevention.\nDespite the limited research field, the present review indicates important insights and tendencies for research and practice. Thus, especially sociodemographic variables, such as a differentiation between age groups, should be considered in future research. In the course of the next few years, it will be important to identify the long-term effects in order to expand the innovation capability described above. Accordingly, this means for policy to support digital gamified interventions, in research and in practice, to promote one\u2019s mental health. The implementation of digital interventions for treatment presents one important step in the right direction. Now, gamification should become more of a focus. Another important aspect that was taken up is the satisfaction of basic needs. In future work, the reference to self-determination theory could be more strongly focussed, whereby a more well-founded statement could be made with regard to the number and combination of game elements. Along these lines, a taxonomy is needed to adequately address relevant game design elements in the field of mental health promotion and prevention.\nFor the practice of health promotion and prevention, the increasing digital innovations result in new interfaces that need to be linked in the future. For instance, data protection is more important than ever, and the success of gamified interventions is related to the trust of users. Among other things, the current information overload is an important issue. Therefore, high-quality interventions need to be made transparent. With regard to reaching specific groups of people and associated effects, prevention and health promotion also face innovative strategies. In conclusion, some gaps with considerable potential for further research and practice in health promotion and prevention can be identified in this still very young field of research.\nAvailability of data and materials\nAll data is described in the manuscript and the supplementary material.\nReferences\nDahlgren G, Whitehead M.

      "text": "WHAT IS BEHAVIOURAL FINANCE?\nIt is a branch of Behavioural Economics, which specifically discusses the biases of the practitioners or investors who make the investment or financial decisions; they give a disproportionately higher weight to one choice or against it for no rational reason. It lies in the centre of psychology and finance and gives us a better perspective of finance at play in reality than traditional finance.\nTraditional Finance works under the assumption that all the investors are rational and logical, however in reality, the investors carry biases and can be irrational at a lot of times or have bounded rationality as they are psychological beings. Traditional Finance is guided by the efficient Market Hypothesis, developed by Eugene Fama is when the prices of financial assets are decided when all the market information is available. According to the theory, the only way to achieve higher returns is to take bigger risks.\nOften, traditional finance fails to explain market movements and thus market anomalies cannot be understood through traditional finance but through behavioural finance. It discusses the mistakes that happen while making rational financial decisions and how we can correct them as well as the opportunity that arises for agencies, brands and big players in the market who can take advantage of these same mistakes.\nAmong the two response systems, namely reflective and reflexive, reflective responses take more effort, which is why investors tend to create shortcuts and heuristics to make their decisions easier. In financial markets, because of these same heuristics or shortcuts or habits which are not very accurate, biases creep in and they tend to overweight certain situations or underweight certain data leads to an impact on their returns.\nKINDS OF BIASES\nThe above-mentioned biases or prejudices that influence decision-making are of various kinds. To understand better how these get in the way of making sound financial decisions, we will discuss the types of biases:\n- AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC- The immediate examples that come to mind and can be easily and quickly understood are the ones the practitioners form a bias towards\n- HERD MENTALITY- When the investors follow and copy what other investors are doing and do not form their own opinion or do their research is referred to as herd mentality\n- CONFIRMATION BIAS- When the investor comes across a piece of information, they tend to find the parts that affirm to their prior beliefs and thus form a bias\n- RECENCY BIAS- It is an example of memory bias, where the examples that have been experienced recently form a bias as compared to the ones that occurred in the relative past\n- LOSS AVERSION- It describes that the emotional impact of a loss is experienced at a greater level as compared to a gain of the same amount. Hence the investors are under this bias as they are guided by fear.\n- OVERCONFIDENCE- A lot of times, the investors tend to overestimate their skill and trade irrationally and frequently and end up ignoring relevant information and hence form a bias.\nTYPES OF TRADING APPS\n- Discount brokers apps- These apps provide low-cost trading and investing services without any personalized investing advice. These apps are mobile friendly providing traders a direct access to the markets without any intervention. These are suitable for individuals who are cost-conscious and prefer to maintain their own portfolios without extensive support.\nExamples- Zerodha, Upstox\n- Trading focused apps- These apps are specifically suited for active traders who are involved in intraday trading or derivatives trading. They offer easy access to market information like price levels, order size and charting tools to help the trader in making accurate and quick decisions.\nExamples- Kite, AngelOne\n- Traditional bank-based brokers- These apps provide a comprehensive range of services from investment advice, portfolio management to stock trading, mutual funds bonds etc. They directly link the trading account with the existing savings account and demat account providing a one stop shop. As compared to the discounted brokers apps, traditional bank-based brokers charge fees based on the percentage of transaction value. It is suitable for those individuals looking for premium services and are willing to pay to get a financial plan suitably tailored for them.\nExample- HDFC securities, ICICI Direct, Motilal Oswal Financial Services\n- Mutual fund platforms- These apps focus on long-term investing through mutual funds. They offer direct mutual fund plans which eliminates intermediary commission.\nExample- Zerodha Coin, Groww, ET Money\nGAMIFIED TRADING APPS: INVESTING SHOULD BE FUN!\nDopamine, addiction and hence hours long of time of investors is being looked out and searched for by gamified trading apps to extract a lot of money out of a surprisingly small group of people. Before the entry of these apps, the majority of work of attracting investors was done by stockbrokers who ended up having a negative image of pushing deals over to traders for their brokerage. But now, as these companies have cut down all the people in between, companies like Robinhood have come forward to offer trades for free with other ways to extract money from clients. They get people to trade as much as possible and that\u2019s by converting the whole process of investing into a giant game where investors play against confetti animations, for high scores.\nNEO BROKER TRADING APPS\nNeo brokers are digital financial services that make trading and investing more accessible to a broader consumer base. They offer zero or low-cost commission, seamless interface and an overall user-friendly experience.\nFeatures of Neo brokers/dopamine driven apps that influences trader behaviour-\n- Instant Gratification- Trading apps are designed in a way that they provide instant feedback, rewards and updates which keeps the traders fervently dedicated. Features like Real time updates about profit and loss keeps the trader emotionally invested and the option of buying and selling stocks with one click leads to impulsive and irrational decisions among a few retail investors.\n- Gamification Elements- It means using game-like features to keep the traders hooked and make trading more engaging. They include features like leader boards, charts, confetti on execution, streaks and badges etc. Coin DCX an Indian crypto currency trading app uses streaks to show users the current level they have unlocked just like candy crush!\nDespite the negative effects, it still offers some benefits like gamified learning and financial literacy by making trading more interesting and appealing.\n- Constant market updates and push notifications- The notifications of how the markets are moving and highlighting the \u2018hot stocks\u2019 creates a feeling of FOMO, and pushes investors to take action, also commonly known as herd mentality. When a notification pops up on the mobile screen, \u201cstocks of X company are up by 9%. Buy them now!\u201d, it creates a sense of urgency and leads to excessive risky trades.\n- Leverage offers- Some trading apps offer Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services which acts as an incentive for traders to continue trading. With low entry costs, investors generally carry an attitude like they have \u2018nothing to lose\u2019 so they jump in and trade risky stocks without any prior research or financial discipline. When the brokerage costs or commissions are high, the investors tend to be cautious with their decisions which has completely changed now.\nIn the US alone more than 10 million new investors entered the markets in the first half of 2021, according to JMP Securities. A similar rise has been observed in India. According to data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), new Demat accounts surged to a record high of 10.7 million between April 2020 and January 2021. This is more than twice the number of new accounts opened in FY20, which was 4.7 million. This section discusses the key features of trading apps which have attracted many investors in recent years.\nCONVENIENCE-DEMOCRATIZING THE INVESTMENT LANDSCAPE\nOne of the key elements pulling more users towards trading apps is the convenience in their usage. They allow traders to trade stocks, mutual funds, options and other financial instruments with ease, anywhere and anytime. Most of such apps have a simple, intuitive and easy to use interface and it does not take them much time to get a hang of the investing process. Not only is buying and selling instruments hassle-free, payments and receipts are also prompt. Traditionally, investing in stocks was considered the realm of the affluent, educated and professionals with in-depth knowledge of the market and its nitty-gritties. The process was cumbersome and time-taking, often requiring one to go through brokers or financial advisors who would execute trades on behalf of investors. The advent of online trading apps, however, has brought a radical shift and has gradually been promoting financial inclusion for the retail investors.\nFINANCIAL ACCESSIBILITY: AFFORDABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE INVESTING\nHistorically, trading stocks and investments were associated with high costs, with brokers charging substantial fees for their services. Online trading apps have revolutionized this aspect by providing a cost-effective platform for trading. Most of these apps offer minimal to zero-commissioned trading experience significantly lowering financial barriers for novice investors and ones with limited capital. However, this may raise questions about the revenue generation of these trading apps. While apps generate revenue through advertisements, premium subscriptions and other ways, one way is through Payment for Order Flow (PFOF). PFOF is a form of compensation that a trading app receives for directing orders and executing trades to a particular market maker or exchange. This allows them to offer commission-free services while still generating revenue.\nTECHNOLOGY HARNESSED TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME UPDATES & A BETTER EXPERIENCE\nThe novelty and innovation behind trading apps stems from the integration of technology and AI with the finance world. These apps leverage the power of tech and ML algorithms to generate analytics and insights allowing them to track their record and make better decisions. Another valuable feature of trading apps is the provision of real-time market updates. In the dynamic world of stock trading, staying updated with real-time information is essential. Trading apps make this easier by allowing users to monitor their investments and market trends instantly, helping them make informed decisions timely. These platforms also put investors in the driver\u2019s seat\u2014rather than promoting dependence on a broker. With real-time updates and analytics, they can buy and sell instruments of their own accord considering any associated future risks. Trading services coupled with an array of other investment tools ultimately enhance user experience. They often offer portfolio trackers, technical analysis instruments, market news updates, historical data, and future projections. These tools empower users with valuable insights, aiding in sound decision-making, and refining investment strategies. Online stock trading apps prioritize the security of their user\u2019s data and investments. They employ end-to-end encryption, biometric authentication, and other advanced security measures to ensure that the user\u2019s data and funds are safeguarded against potential threats.\nThe above-mentioned engaging and seamless features of dopamine-driven trading apps keep drawing in more investors. With real-time updates, instant trade execution, and user-friendly interfaces, these platforms make investing more accessible and appealing. As a result, their popularity continues to surge, reshaping the trading landscape. However, it is essential to look at the other side of these features which is not so alluring. For instance, in the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether apps are irresponsibly encouraging overtrading using excessive email alerts and by making investment feel like a game.\nLet\u2019s discuss what nuances of trading apps lead to impulsive and irrational decisions.\nDARK SIDE OF GAMIFICATION:EXAMINING ITS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON FINANCIAL MARKETS\nAlthough, gamification of the trading process incentivizes investor to engage more, but gamifying to a degree it actually feels like playing a game with hypothetical corpus may lead to irrationality. In many trading apps, every purchase is responded to with rewards like a score or confetti rain. This stimulates dopamine release in the user making him want to invest again without care. Behavioural psychology dictates that whenever you reward a certain behaviour a person is more likely to repeat it. A reward makes our brain produce dopamine (happy chemicals) and because dopamine makes one feel happy, the person remembers how the dopamine release was triggered (here: through trading) and tries to experience the same situation repeatedly leading to irrational and impulsive decisions.\nFROM CASINOS TO STOCK MARKETS: THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PARALLELS BETWEEN GAMBLING & TRADING APPS\nResearch by CFA Institute found that 61% of Gen Z investors aged 18\u201325 gamble online or in-person, compared with only 29% of their age group who do not invest. These statistics indicate a strong relation between gambling and overtrading (or trading irrationally).\nGambling addiction is dopamine related and this addiction stems from desires that seek pleasures, where sensations of pleasure involve dopamine flows crossing the benchmark level that is considered normal. Gambling addicts find it more difficult to generate dopamine hikes. Therefore, they need more intensive stimuli than others to trigger the same kinds of highs. Furthermore, the brain of an addict is not equipped enough to produce self-control. Taking these two features together means that gambling addicts happen to take greater risks to achieve the same psychological highs than others, and are more prone to do so, even when they know that the behaviour is highly imprudent.\nTrading apps stimulate a similar experience for the user which if not kept under check, can lead to a gambling-like experience. Using digital prompts, apps like neo brokers generate stimuli which activate the dopamine-based reward centers in investors\u2019 brains.\nInvestor Warren Buffett said that the apps were bringing casino-like behaviour to the stock market. Although the similarities between investing and gambling have been in talks for a long time, new forms of online apps and platforms have created a new need for more concern in this area. These apps and platforms offer fast and easy entry into diverse investing opportunities and risks, and they are also potentially attractive to people manifesting excessive returns. Such apps and platforms also offer high-risk investing options such as leverage (using borrowed capital) which multiplies both wins and losses and carries a risk of losing all of one\u2019s own capital in forced liquidation which is very similar to losses happening due to gambling . Studies suggest that personal risk factors, such as risk-taking, sensation-seeking, and overconfidence, are similar for both gambling and stock trading and this has been expedited by dopamine-driven trading apps.\nWAYS TO OVERCOME BIASES\nAs investors, after understanding behavioural finance in theory, we also should comprehend it in reality and be able to apply this information practically. Hence, we shall look forward to a few solutions to overcome the psychological biases in investing.\nTAKE YOUR TIME\nWe should take our full time to do our research and not get influenced by the masses or our already-known information. We should first focus on collecting the right information and then make an informed decision based on that. We should seek financial advice for proper understanding.\nDECIDE YOUR GOAL OR PURPOSE BEHIND INVESTING\nTo differentiate yourself from the masses, and overcome the bias of herd mentality, we should first get our personal reason behind investing and invest accordingly.\nASSET ALLOCATION/ DIVERSIFICATION\nSelecting multiple stocks or assets and diversifying your portfolio is a good way to overcome biases since we do not risk all our money in one preferred selection\nINVESTING DISCIPLINE\nYou should develop your discipline and make your own set of rules for investing for yourself and commit to them\nCONCLUSION\nThe rise of dopamine-driven trading apps has completely transformed the investment landscape, making investment activities more approachable and engaging for a rising cohort of investors. By simplifying the mechanisms of a complex investment system and enabling user-friendly interfaces, such platforms have democratized investing like never before. However, leveraging psychological triggers as a means of pulling more users may not go a long way. Too much gamification or excessive indulgence can trigger irrational decisions that are stimulated by the dopamine-driven rewards embedded into these apps. Although these advancements have revolutionized traditional market participation, it is crucial to acknowledge the psychological and social risks connected with it and develop mechanisms that keep these downsides under check so that such apps contribute to the economy rather than becoming a gamble.\nREFERENCES\n- Bansal, Shikha. 2020.

      "text": "With additional reporting by John Dobosz and Jeff Kauflin\nThe note found on his computer by his parents on June 12, 2020, asked a simple question. \u201cHow was a 20 year old with no income able to get assigned almost a million dollars worth of leverage?\u201d The tragic message was written by Alexander E. Kearns, a 20-year-old student at the University of Nebraska, home from college and living with his parents in Naperville, Illinois. Earlier that day, Kearns took his own life.\nRobinhood\u2019s founders have since responded to Kearns\u2019 death by suicide, pledging major changes to their platform\u2014especially around options trading.\nLike so many others, Kearns took up stock investing during the pandemic, signing up with Millennial-focused brokerage firm Robinhood, which offers commission-free trading, a fun and easy-to-use mobile app and even awards new customers free shares of stock. During the first quarter of 2020, Robinhood added a record 3 million new accounts to its platform. As the Covid-19 stock market swung wildly, Kearns had begun experimenting, trading options. His final note, filled with anger toward Robinhood, says that he had \u201cno clue\u201d what he was doing.\nIn fact, a screenshot from Kearns\u2019 mobile phone reveals that while his account had a negative $730,165 cash balance displayed in red, it may not have represented uncollateralized indebtedness at all, but rather his temporary balance until the stocks underlying his assigned options actually settled into his account.\nSilicon Valley-based Robinhood is not sharing details of Kearns\u2019 account, citing privacy concerns: \u201cAll of us at Robinhood are deeply saddened to hear this terrible news and we reached out to share our condolences with the family over the weekend.\u201d\nIt\u2019s impossible to know all of the factors contributing to suicide, especially in young people. Still, the tragic demise of Alexander Kearns is a cautionary tale of the serious risks associated with the race to the bottom in the brokerage business. Robinhood, E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Fidelity and even Merrill Lynch have all embraced commission-free trading and zero-minimum balances in an effort to attract younger customers, many of whom have little understanding of the securities and markets they are dabbling in.\n\u201cI thought everything was going fine,\u201d says Bill Brewster, Kearns\u2019 cousin-in-law and a research analyst at Chicago-based Sullimar Capital Group. His father said he was loving the markets and really enjoying investing, Brewster told Forbes, \u201cand then on Friday night, we got this call from his mom, and he had died.\u201d\nKearns apparently fell into despair late Thursday night after looking at his Robinhood account, which appeared to have $16,000 in it but also showed a cash balance of negative $730,165. In his final note, seen by Forbes, Kearns insisted that he never authorized margin trading and was shocked to find his small account could rack up such an apparent loss.\n\u201cWhen he saw that $730,000 number as a negative, he thought that he had blown up his entire future,\u201d says Brewster. \u201cI mean this is a kid that when he was younger was so conscious about savings.\u201d\nAlthough Robinhood won\u2019t release the details of his account, it\u2018s possible that Kearns was trading what\u2019s known as a \u201cbull put spread.\u201d Put options give buyers the right to sell the stock at the strike price anytime until expiration, while put-sellers are on the hook to buy the underlying stock at the strike price, if assigned. This happens automatically at expiration if the price of the underlying stock closes that day at a price one penny or more below the strike price.\nIn Kearns\u2019 note, he says that the puts he bought and sold \u201cshould have cancelled out,\u201d because normally a bull put spread involves selling put options at a higher strike price, and buying puts at a lower strike price, both with the same expiration. The trade generates a net credit, which the options trader keeps if the stock price stays above the higher strike price through expiration. It\u2019s generally considered a limited risk strategy because the simultaneous purchase and sale of put options means the maximum loss on a per-share basis is the difference between the strike prices, less the amount earned when the puts are sold initiating the trade.\nThere can be wrinkles, however, when the price of the underlying stock at expiration is between the two strike prices, or in the case of early assignment, which may have occurred in Kearns\u2019 account.\nHere\u2019s an example of how a bull put spread could produce an unexpectedly large stock position in your portfolio. On June 16, Amazon (AMZN) trades at $2,615 per share. If you\u2019re neutral to bullish on Amazon, you could sell put options that expire on July 17 with a $2,615 strike price for $28 per option. To limit your risk, the other leg of the trade is to purchase puts at a lower strike price, $2,610, for a cost of $26. That two-dollar differential (multiplied by 100) generates $200 for every contract you sell. Do three contracts and you generate $600. If Amazon closes on July 17 above $2,615, you\u2019re in the clear and keep all of the proceeds, as both puts expire worthless. If the stock closes below $2610, you will encounter your maximum loss of $900: $5.00 (difference between strike prices) minus $2.00 (proceeds earned up front) times three contracts.\nWhen the stock closes between the two strike prices, the put you bought at the lower strike price expires worthless, but the one you sold is in the money and legally binds you to buy the stock at the strike price. In the case of three contracts of $2,615 Amazon puts, that would be $784,500 to purchase 300 shares. Over a weekend, say, you may see a \u2013$784,500 debit to buy the stock, but you would not see the stock among your holdings until Monday.\nKearns may not have realized that his negative cash balance displaying on his Robinhood home screen was only temporary and would be corrected once the underlying stock was credited to his account. Indeed it\u2019s not uncommon for cash and buying power to display negative after the first half of options are processed but before the second options are exercised\u2014even if the portfolio remains positive.\n\u201cTragically, I don\u2019t even think he made that big of a mistake. This is an interface issue, they have slick interfaces. Confetti popping everywhere,\u201d says Brewster referring to the shower of colorful confetti Robinhood routinely deploys after customers make trades. \u201cThey try to gamify trading and couch it as investment.\u201d\nSays Robinhood: \u201cWe are committed to continuously improving our platform and are reviewing our options offering to determine if any changes may be appropriate.\u201d\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or text the Crisis Text Line at 741-741."

      "url": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-powerful-is-gamification-in-investing#:~:text=Gamification%20in%20investing%20can,dismantling%20these%20barriers%20to%20entry.",
      "text": "How Powerful Is Gamification In Investing?\nGamification in investing can be defined as the strategic integration of game-like elements, such as rewards, competition, and interactive features, into financial platforms and applications. This approach is designed to engage and motivate users in their investment activities by drawing inspiration from principles commonly found in video games.\nGamification aims to simplify and make the traditionally complex world of finance more accessible, user-friendly, and engaging. It encourages investors to actively participate in the market, learn about investment strategies, and manage their portfolios with enthusiasm and interactivity that surpasses traditional, text-heavy financial interfaces. Let's take a look at how gamification can affect the investing landscape.\nThe Pros of Gamification in Investing\nA primary advantage of gamification in investing lies in the improved accessibility it offers. Traditionally, investing was often perceived as a complex and daunting pursuit, primarily accessible to those with a strong financial background. Gamification simplifies the investment process by dismantling these barriers to entry. It accomplishes this through intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that facilitate comprehension and navigation within the world of investments.\nGamified platforms enable users to access investment opportunities without the confusion of industry jargon and technical intricacies, particularly appealing to newcomers in the market. The user-friendly interfaces in gamified investment platforms are designed with the user's ease in mind. They emphasize simplicity and visual appeal, rendering the investment process more engaging and less intimidating.\nThese platforms frequently incorporate interactive elements, including progress bars, achievement badges, and user-friendly dashboards, enhancing the overall user experience.\nBy mirroring the aesthetics and dynamics of popular video games, these interfaces create a more inviting environment for prospective investors, effectively lowering the psychological barriers that can dissuade individuals from venturing into the world of finance.\nAnother significant advantage of gamification in investing is integrating educational resources directly into the investment experience. This is pivotal in nurturing informed decision-making among investors. Educational components within gamification encompass tutorials, quizzes, articles, and videos accessible to users as they explore and trade in the market. This real-time learning experience proves invaluable for investors seeking to expand their knowledge and confidence in their investment endeavors.\nMany platforms have successfully merged gamification and education to offer users a comprehensive grasp of investment strategies, risk management, and market dynamics. For instance, some platforms provide simulations that permit users to practice trading with virtual currency, allowing them to gain experience without risking their capital.\nOne popular example is Robinhood, a commission-free trading app, that incorporates gamification elements to enhance the user experience. This includes features such as \"free stocks,\" which reward users with a free stock upon signing up and additional stocks for referrals. These immediate rewards aim to motivate and engage users, tapping into the psychological principles often used in games to foster participation and excitement.\nThe competitive aspect is introduced through leaderboards, where users can compete with friends and peers, adding a sense of challenge and achievement. Additionally, the ability to invest in fractional shares and the inclusion of educational content make investing more accessible and less intimidating, particularly for beginners.\nOther platforms offer educational content that elucidates essential concepts and strategies, often in an interactive and engaging format. This fusion of gamification and education empowers investors to make well-informed decisions, mitigating the risks associated with financial markets while enhancing their potential for successful outcomes.\nFor example, Banksters is an NFT-based play-and-earn game that combines aspects of investments and crypto mining, offering an entry point into the Web3 gaming sphere for trading enthusiasts. It incorporates a unique player-versus-player (PvP) structure, where participants, known as \"Banksters,\" use customized avatars with specific skills. The game is designed to include a diverse audience and provides the potential for financial rewards based on market predictions and control.\nAdditionally, Banksters is an educational platform for those interested in learning about trading techniques and market trends. Players can learn market psychology, risk management, and technical analysis while engaging in the game.\nThe pros of gamification in investing are indeed transformative. Gamification has dismantled traditional barriers to entry, making investing accessible to a broader audience, regardless of their prior financial knowledge or experience. It simplifies the investment process through user-friendly interfaces that are intuitive and engaging, inviting newcomers into the financial market with open arms.\nThe Cons of Gamification in Investing\nWhile gamification in investing offers several advantages, it also comes with its own set of drawbacks.\nIncreased Risk-Taking\nGamification can unintentionally promote heightened risk-taking among investors. This is primarily due to the psychological aspects inherent in gamified investing platforms, where the excitement of participating in challenges, earning rewards, and achieving objectives can incentivize users to take risks they might not contemplate in a more conventional investment environment.\nElements of gamification, like points, badges, and leaderboards, tap into the psychological triggers that drive individuals to take risks in gaming settings. The pursuit of higher scores or rewards often takes precedence over the assessment of actual investment risks. Consequently, investors may engage in speculative or impulsive trading, driven by the desire for immediate gains, even when such decisions may not be financially prudent.\nThe real-world consequences of excessive risk-taking in gamified investing can be substantial. Investors who prioritize gamified goals and rewards over prudent financial strategies may experience significant losses, potentially leading to financial instability, particularly for those lacking the experience or knowledge to navigate the complexities of investments. Additionally, such behavior can contribute to market volatility and pose systemic risks if many investors adopt a similar high-risk approach.\nFostered Short-Term Mindset\nOne of the notable disadvantages of gamification in investing is its tendency to foster a short-term mindset among users. Gamified platforms provide instant gratification through rewards and challenges, but they can unintentionally promote a focus on short-term gains instead of long-term financial objectives.\nGamification often relies on immediate feedback and rewards to keep users engaged. This can result in investors prioritizing short-term trading and quick wins over the patient, long-term investment strategies that tend to be more reliable and less volatile. Users may become overly preoccupied with daily portfolio fluctuations, leading to impulsive buying and selling decisions, rather than adhering to a well-considered, long-term investment plan.\nThe implications of a short-term mindset in gamified investing are concerning. Investors might miss out on the advantages of compounding returns as they frequently adjust their portfolios. This can impede their ability to achieve substantial long-term financial goals, such as building wealth over time. In essence, while gamification can make investing more engaging, it can also distract from the disciplined and strategic approach typically necessary for long-term financial success.\nMaking the Most of Gamification in Investing\nMaking the most of gamification in investing is a matter of taking an active and responsible approach to managing your financial journey. While gamification can undoubtedly improve the investment experience, it's essential to recognize your pivotal role in this process, especially when managing risks and maintaining a long-term perspective.\nFirstly, it's crucial to understand your role in managing risks. Gamified platforms can sometimes tempt users into impulsive or risky trading behavior because of the allure of rewards and instant gratification. Awareness of this psychological aspect is key, and actively working to counter such tendencies is necessary.\nResponsible investing involves making well-informed decisions, conducting thorough research, and understanding the potential consequences of your actions. Self-awareness and diligence are essential for ensuring that gamification enhances your investing experience without leading to hasty or ill-considered choices.\nSecondly, maintaining a long-term perspective is critical. Gamification often introduces elements emphasizing short-term rewards and challenges, potentially diverting your attention from your broader financial objectives. To maximize gamification, establish clear, long-term financial goals and resist the temptation to frequently monitor and adjust your investments based on short-term market fluctuations. By adopting a strategic and patient approach, you can leverage the engaging features of gamification while ensuring that your overall financial strategy remains steadfast.\nDiversification is another key element to optimize the benefits of gamification in investing. Diversifying your investment portfolio involves spreading investments across various asset classes, industries, and geographic regions. Gamified platforms often offer access to a wide array of investment options, and you should utilize this feature to create a diversified portfolio. This mitigates risks and enhances the potential for returns by reducing the impact of poor-performing assets.\nFurthermore, don't forget the value of thorough research. Even within gamified platforms, where the investment process might be more engaging and interactive, due diligence fundamentals remain indispensable. Before making investment decisions, research the assets you intend to invest in, understand their risk factors, and assess their alignment with your financial objectives. Gamification should enhance the research process by making it more accessible and engaging, rather than replacing it altogether.\nIn closing\nGamification in investing brings a mix of opportunities and challenges. It's pretty clear that to make the most of it, we need to approach it with a balanced perspective. While gamification has undoubtedly made investing more accessible and engaging, it also calls for responsible use.\nEncouraging responsible use of gamified platforms is something we all should be invested in. Regulators have a role in setting rules that protect investors, preventing them from taking undue risks and ensuring that these platforms aren't misused.\nMeanwhile, platform developers should prioritize education and encourage smart decision-making, rather than just pushing for quick, impulsive actions. These platforms should also include features discouraging excessive risk-taking and promoting a longer-term view of investing.\nBut investors also have a significant part in this. It's crucial to recognize the psychological appeal of gamified elements and be aware of our impulses. Responsible investing means doing our homework, setting long-term financial goals, and building diversified portfolios. This way, we can enjoy the interactive side of gamification while making sure we're making sound and strategic investment choices.\nSo, in the end, it's a call to action for us investors to leverage gamification wisely while steering clear of its potential downsides. Gamification has the potential to bring a fresh approach to investing, but it needs to be used thoughtfully and responsibly. With a balanced perspective, a focus on long-term financial goals, and thorough research, we can make the most of gamification while safeguarding our financial future.\nAs gamification continues to evolve, our vigilance and proactive approach are key to ensuring that this innovative method effectively serves our financial interests and long-term goals.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

      "text": "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has warned stock trading app operators to review design features, including those with game-like elements, which risk prompting consumers to take actions against their own interest.\nFeatures include sending frequent notifications with the latest market news and providing consumers with in-app points, badges and celebratory messages for making trades. The FCA has found that consumers using apps with these kind of features were more likely to invest in products beyond their risk appetite.\nAlongside its warning to app-operators, the FCA has published research that raises concerns that customers using such trading apps are exposed to high-risk investments, and that some appear to exhibit behaviours similar to problem-gambling.\nWhilst gamification can be used to engage consumers positively, the FCA found it being used in ways that may mislead consumers or lead to poor outcomes and problem behaviours.\nSarah Pritchard, Executive Director of Markets at the FCA, said:\n'Some product design features could be contributing to problematic, even gambling-like, investor behaviour. We expect all firms that offer stock trading to consumers to review and, where appropriate, make improvements to their products based on these findings. They should also ensure they are providing support to their customers, particularly those in vulnerable circumstances or those showing signs of problem gambling behaviour.'\nThe FCA intends to do further research into trading app use and design features, in particular to understand some wider financial vulnerabilities for users of these apps, such as whether they borrow to invest and the scale of any losses. The FCA\u2019s 2022 Financial Lives Survey found 9% of all adults with investments have borrowed to invest and 49% of these would not have been able to make the investment without doing so.\nTo ensure customers are being treated fairly and ahead of the new Consumer Duty coming into force next year, all firms should be reviewing their products now to ensure they are fit for purpose.\nThe Consumer Duty stipulates that firms must design services so that consumers can make effective, timely and properly informed decisions about financial products and services.\nNotes to editors\n- Read the research article.\n- Firms in this market should be proactively considering potential vulnerabilities in their customer base. The FCA\u2019s vulnerability guidance outlines its expectations.\n- Find out more information about the FCA."

      "text": "Gamification is rapidly reshaping how people consume information and engage with the world. It uses strategies such as clear goals, instant rewards and engaging visuals to make everyday tasks more enjoyable, often in a digital setting.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic nudged consumers to embrace no-contact, instant gratification experiences in an increasingly digital world.\nBusinesses found that gamification attracts new customers while keeping the existing ones engaged. As evidenced by the meteoric rise of the Robinhood investment app, even trading platforms haven\u2019t been able to escape the pull of gamification.\nWhile trading gamification attracts new and younger investors to financial markets, a key question arises: do digital engagement strategies shape investor behaviour?\nFlashy features and poor financial decisions\nIn recent years, fierce competition among online brokers has pushed them to stand out with features beyond lower fees. To boost trading activity, many brokers have implemented gamified features ranging from vibrant colours and celebratory animations, to social ranking boards and frequent price alerts.\nMy recent research shows that these strategies are particularly effective for new investors with lower financial literacy. While it\u2019s effective at attracting users, gamification can lead inexperienced traders to make poor decisions by magnifying their behavioural biases.\nMy co-researchers and I studied the effect of gamification on retail traders\u2019 behaviour using a randomized online experiment. The results echo the widespread concerns that gamification fuels investors\u2019 competitive instincts and their urge to \u201chit big.\u201d Turning trading into a casino-like experience encourages reckless decision-making.\nInfamous long-term investor Warren Buffett has also expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of \u201cinstant gratification\u201d on investor behaviour. He believes that \u201ctoo many modern investors have become entranced by speculative investing\u201d and are \u201csimply buying stocks that are trendy.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s important to introduce the younger generation to financial markets, Buffett\u2019s warning resonates at a deeper level. Is the increasingly gamified trading environment equipping new investors with the skills and confidence to build a strong financial future, or is it designed to exploit their weaknesses?\nAnd ultimately, how can technology be leveraged to build a healthier, more sustainable economy?\nWho benefits from financial literacy?\nMy co-researchers and I argue that both retail investors and intermediaries ultimately benefit from boosting financial literacy from an early age \u2014 that is, before plunging into the wild waters of financial markets.\nUltimately, the responsibility lies with individual investors to take the initiative to understand the fundamentals of financial markets and risk management. By seeking out knowledge before entering markets, they can reduce their risk and become aware of their biases and blind spots.\nTraders who don\u2019t prioritize their education may end up learning the reality of markets the hard way \u2014 often through losses in post-mortem reflection.\nAt the same time, brokerages and trading platforms have both a profit-driven and an ethical stake in promoting financial literacy. Informed users are more likely to become loyal long-term customers who engage more deeply with platforms and trading responsibly over time. Financially literate traders benefit from gamification techniques like price notifications, which allow them to correct their mistakes faster.\nFrom an ethical standpoint, financial institutions must reflect on whether they would rather empower a new generation of investors or merely turn them into gamblers.\nFinancial education is key\nSchool systems\u2019 improved or renewed efforts to empower students to navigate the economy safely and productively have received significant attention in light of both post-pandemic and inflationary economic challenges.\nAs students move up the education ladder, they could learn about more sophisticated financial products, such as leverage, derivatives or alternative investments.\nRead more: A back-to-school wish list for Ontario's 2025 high school financial literacy requirement\nHowever, the financial world is growing ever more complex with the inclusion of novel products such as cryptocurrencies and leveraged funds. Every investor faces \u2014 or will eventually face \u2014 unique financial challenges.\nThe real question is: how can we improve investors\u2019 financial literacy at scale without expecting everyone to earn the equivalent of a business degree?\nAI and the future of financial education\nThis is where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in. AI is experiencing rapid growth and can adapt learning plans based on users\u2019 existing knowledge, unique planning needs, learning pace and preferred engagement formats.\nThis adaptability makes AI a powerful tool for creating learning opportunities for investors by catering to varying learning needs.\nWide-scale collaboration among regulators, business educators and financial markets could lead to innovative programs using scalable, user-friendly tools such as chatbots. Such an approach would help improve financial literacy on a large scale and enable evidence-based policy by observing investor behaviour.\nImproving financial literacy is urgent. As a new generation of traders enters gamified investing, they risk losing their savings due to poor decisions, behavioural biases and excessive trading. Early losses can stunt a generation\u2019s future wealth prospects and set them back years, if not decades.\nOnly investors with strong critical thinking skills and self-control will progress from beginners to experienced traders and avoid falling prey to impulsive decisions."

  "argos_summary": "Gamified investing blends game mechanics with trading apps, attracting many emerging adults but raising mental\u2011health and behavioral concerns such as increased risk\u2011taking, short\u2011term focus, and gambling\u2011like habits. Studies and regulatory warnings (e.g., FCA, 2025 IV\u2011capital report) link such platforms to anxiety, depression, financial losses, and even suicide, especially among users with low financial literacy. While some research shows positive effects on well\u2011being and financial education, the evidence is mixed and often limited by short study durations and high dropout rates. The consensus urges responsible design, user education, and regulatory oversight to balance engagement with financial and psychological safety, and to harness gamification\u2019s potential for promoting mental health and financial literacy.",
