  "description": "The severely indebted real estate developer China Evergrande, already in the process of liquidation, said on Tuesday it will be delisted from Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange on Aug. 25, another setback to mainland China\u2019s property sector.",
  "content": "The severely indebted real estate developer China Evergrande, already in the process of liquidation, said on Tuesday it will be delisted from Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange on Aug. 25, another setback to mainland China\u2019s property sector.\n\nEvergrande was the world\u2019s most heavily indebted real estate developer, with over $300 billion owed to banks and bondholders, when the court handed down a liquidation order in January 2024. The court had ruled that the company had failed to provide a viable restructuring plan for its debts, which fueled fears about China\u2019s rising debt burden, and trading of its shares has been halted since the ruling.\n\nThe city\u2019s rules stipulate that the listing of companies may be canceled if trading in their securities has remained suspended for 18 months consecutively.\n\nChina Evergrande Group received a letter Aug. 8 from the city\u2019s stock exchange notifying the firm of its decision to cancel the listing as trading had not resumed by Jul. 28. The last day of the listing will be Aug. 22 and Evergrande will not apply for a review of the decision, the company said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAll shareholders, investors and potential investors of the company should note that after the last listing date, whilst the share certificates of the shares will remain valid, the shares will not be listed on, and will not be tradeable on the Stock Exchange,\u201d the statement said.\n\nEvergrande is among scores of developers that defaulted on debts after Chinese regulators cracked down on excessive borrowing in the property industry in 2020. Unable to obtain financing, their vast obligations to creditors and customers became unsustainable.\n\nThe crackdown also tipped the property industry into crisis, dragging down the world\u2019s second-largest economy and rattling financial systems in and outside China. Once among the nation\u2019s strongest growth engines, the industry is struggling to exit a prolonged downturn. Home prices in China have continued to fall even after the introduction of supportive measures by policymakers.\n\nThe Hong Kong court system has been dealing with liquidation petitions against some Chinese property developers, including one of the largest Chinese real estate companies, Country Garden, which is expected to have another hearing in January.\n\nChina South City Holdings, a smaller property developer, was also ordered to liquidate on Monday.\n\nEvergrande, founded in the mid-1990s by Hui Ka Yan, also known as Xu Jiayin, had over 90% of its assets on the Chinese mainland, according to the 2024 ruling. The firm was listed in Hong Kong in 2009 as \u201cEvergrande Real Estate Group\u201d and suspended its share trading on Jan. 29, 2024, at 0.16 Hong Kong dollars ($0.02).\n\nIts liquidators said in a progress report that they received debt claims totalling $45 billion as of Jul. 31, much higher than the some $27.5 billion of liabilities disclosed in December 2022, and that the new figure was not final.\n\nThe liquidators said they have assumed control of over 100 companies within the group and entities under their direct management control with collective assets valued at $3.5 billion as of Jan. 29, 2024. They said an estimate of the amounts that may ultimately be realized from these entities wasn\u2019t available yet.\n\nAbout $255 million worth of assets have been sold, the liquidators said, calling the realization \u201cmodest.\u201d Of this amount, $244 million was derived from subsidiaries\u2019 assets, and not all of them will be available to the company, given the complex ownership structures of the assets.\n\n\u201cThe liquidators believe that a holistic restructuring will prove out of reach, but they will, of course, explore any credible possibilities in this regard that may present themselves,\u201d they said.\n\nHui, Evergrande\u2019s founder, was detained in China in September 2023 on suspicion of committing crimes, adding to the company\u2019s woes.\n\nIn 2024, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued a fine of 4.2 billion yuan (about $584 million) against the firm\u2019s subsidiary, Hengda Real Estate Group Company, over violations including falsifying financial records. Hui was fined 47 million yuan ($6.5 million) and barred from China\u2019s securities markets for life. Some other executives were also penalised.\n\nChinese authorities in September 2024 banned the accounting firm PwC for six months and fined the company more than 400 million yuan ($56.4 million) over its involvement in the audit of the collapsed property developer.",

PwC Zhong Tian, the registered accounting entity and the main onshore arm of PwC in China, was the country\u2019s top-earning auditor in 2022, according to the latest official data.\n\u201cWe are disappointed by PwC Zhong Tian\u2019s audit work of Hengda, which fell unacceptably below the standards we expect of member firms of the PwC network,\u201d PwC network, the alliance of PwC\u2019s global member units, said in a statement.\nThe firm said that, as part of its \u201caccountability and remedial actions,\u201d PwC China\u2019s territory senior partner Daniel Li had stepped down and Hemione Hudson, the firm\u2019s global risk and regulatory leader, had taken over from him.\nThe six-month business suspension was imposed by China\u2019s Ministry of Finance. The ministry also imposed a fine of 116 million yuan ($16 million) on PwC Zhong Tian for its auditing failure of Hengda in 2018, according to an MOF statement.\nThe CSRC said in a separate statement that it had confiscated PwC Zhong Tian\u2019s revenue involved in the Evergrande case totalling 27.7 million yuan and fined the unit 297 million yuan.\n\u201cPwC has, to a certain extent, covered up and even condoned Evergrande\u2019s financial fraud and fraudulent issuance of corporate bonds,\u201d said the CSRC statement.\n\u201cIt (PwC) has to be severely punished according to law.\u201d\nOver the past few months, a growing number of Chinese clients, mainly state-owned enterprises and financial institutions, has been leaving PwC, following the launch of the regulatory investigation into the firm.\nThe firm had about 400 Chinese clients, listed at home or in offshore markets such as Hong Kong or New York, in March this year, including tech behemoths Alibaba and Tencent.\nA Reuters calculation based on filings showed more than 50 Chinese firms, including PwC\u2019s largest mainland China-listed client Bank of China, have either dropped PwC as their auditor or canceled their plans to hire it."

      "text": "After defaulting on its debt two years ago, Chinese real estate developer Evergrande was meant to be restructured and allowed to get back on its feet. But that plan now looks to be in peril, after police detained its chairman as well as staff at a financing subsidiary.\nXu Jiayin, also known as Hui Ka Yan in Cantonese, has been subject to \u201cmandatory measures\u201d on suspicion of crimes, Evergrande said Thursday in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nThe company didn\u2019t elaborate on Xu\u2019s location or the nature of the alleged crimes. Under the Chinese legal system, \u201cmandatory\u201d or \u201ccompulsory\u201d measures can include detention and formal arrest.\nXu founded Evergrande in 1996. His detention casts further serious uncertainty on the future of the embattled property giant, which was hoping to finalize a massive government-supervised debt restructuring plan in the coming weeks to stave off collapse.\nEvergrande, which still has $300 billion in liabilities and continues to bleed money, had already warned Sunday that the restructuring plan may be in trouble because of a regulatory probe into its main property development subsidiary in mainland China. Meetings with creditors were postponed.\n\u201c[Beijing] has certainly changed its posture [towards Evergrande] because what was a debt restructuring story has now taken on the mantle, albeit not yet fact, of a criminal case,\u201d said George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University\u2019s China Centre and SOAS University of London.\nEvergrande could go the way of other failed businesses, such as HNA Group or Anbang, he added. Ten years ago, they were among China\u2019s largest private conglomerates, having gone on a global buying spree. But their chairmen were detained in 2017 and 2021, and both companies were eventually liquidated and taken over by the government.\n\u201cMy guess is that this is going to bury the company as it is, though it could be acquired or broken up,\u201d Magnus said. \u201cThe company will be taken over, parceled out to, or otherwise run by, some [combination] of local government, state developer and banks.\u201d\nBut Chinese authorities will need to tread carefully, cautioned Tyran Kam, Fitch Ratings\u2019 head of China Properties, to prevent a \u201cmessy\u201d collapse.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear what will happen next for the company. But I don\u2019t think the government is deliberately forcing a liquidation,\u201d he said.\nThe chairman\u2019s detention might be partly related to its wealth management unit, Kam said. The unit had been raising funds for its parent firm from individual and corporate investors as part of China\u2019s \u201cshadow banking\u201d sector since 2015.\nEarlier this month, the police in Shenzhen, where Evergrande is headquartered, detained some staff at the unit. It was suspected of \u201cillegal fundraising,\u201d the Shenzhen government\u2019s press office said in an article on its social media account\nAs part of a wider investigation into the company, several other Evergrande executives, including Xu\u2019s son and a former chief financial officer, were also detained, state-owned Yicai reported Thursday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The report was widely cited by other Chinese media before being deleted.\nEvergrande has not responded to a CNN request for comment.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nPreviously China\u2019s second biggest real estate company, Evergrande\u2019s default in 2021 ignited a crisis in the property sector that continues to weigh on the wider economy.\nEvergrande unveiled a $19 billion dollar proposal to make peace with its international creditors in March. In August, it filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States as part of the process.\nBut last Friday, Evergrande canceled meetings with overseas investors scheduled for this week. It said it needed to reassess the terms of the restructuring plan, in part because sales had been weaker than expected.\nTaken together, the detention of its chairman, the criminal and regulatory probes, and its inability to issue new debt means the company\u2019s restructuring could fail. Trading in its shares has been halted until further notice, after plunging more than 80% since they resumed trading in August following a previous 17-month suspension.\n\u201cThe debt restructuring can\u2019t really happen if Evergrade can\u2019t issue new debt or equity, and it doesn\u2019t seem like it can,\u201d Magnus said.\n\u201cSo unless there\u2019s a last minute solution to allow new issuance, the plan looks to be toast. Quite whether there will be such a last minute solution depends on what the government and the regulators have in mind for Evergrande.\u201d\nIf the restructuring fails, and Evergrande can\u2019t strike a new deal with its creditors, it could face liquidation.\nAn investor in the company has already filed a petition in Hong Kong to force the winding up of the business. A growing number of investors are reportedly seeking to join the action if it is unable to come up with a new survival plan soon.\nWhether it will liquidate depends on how the bondholders plan to move forward with their proposal, Kam said.\nHowever, a liquidation will be a \u201cmessy process\u201d for all creditors, he added. When a company liquidates, its assets are frozen, and it stops operations.\nToo many homes\nThat could have far reaching consequences.\nEvergrande still had more than 100,000 employees at the end of 2022 and nearly 800 unfinished real estate projects to build about 700,0000 apartments in more than 200 cities across China. The market is already awash with vacant properties that by one recent estimate could house the country\u2019s entire population.\nIts employees, investors and home buyers have held a number of protests over the past two years to demand unpaid salaries, reimbursement for investment losses or compensation for unfinished homes.\nThere are also implications for thousands of home buyers who have prepaid for their units, the wider economy and domestic and international financial markets.\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t want the fabled middle class to suffer financially, or to lose their homes, but the company is becoming more and more an embarrassment for the authorities,\u201d Magnus said.\nWhile the government may be willing to let Evergrande fall, the impact on households and on confidence in the battered real estate market might be \u201ctoo much,\u201d he said, adding that officials may take steps to soften the blow to home buyers and investors.\nKam, at Fitch, believes the government will study how to stabilize the market after Evergrande falls, including how to continue its operations and complete and deliver its projects.\nAs for Magnus, he believes Evergrande\u2019s time as an independent company is over.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll try to keep its pulse beating for long enough to deliver the properties promised or manage the properties that already exist, but to all intents and purposes, Evergrande is slowly being deconstructed, I would say.\u201d"

      "text": "A court in Hong Kong has ordered the winding up of Evergrande Group, the world\u2019s most indebted property developer, dealing another blow to investor confidence as China\u2019s ailing real estate sector continues to weigh on its economy.\nThe liquidation order, made by the city\u2019s High Court on Monday, comes after the embattled Chinese real estate giant and its overseas creditors failed to agree on how to restructure the company\u2019s massive debt during talks that lasted for 19 months.\n\u201cIt seems to me that the interests of the creditors will be better protected if the company is wound up by the court, so that independent liquidators can take control over the company,\u201d Judge Linda Chan said in the ruling published Monday.\nEvergrande defaulted on its debt in 2021, sparking a property crisis in China\u2019s economy, which continues to feel the effects. The Shenzhen-based developer, with total liabilities of 2.39 trillion yuan ($333 billion) at the end of June last year, filed for bankruptcy in New York in 2023.\nOverseas creditors are owed $25 billion, the Hong Kong court document showed, and one of them \u2014 Top Shine Global \u2014 filed the winding up petition against Evergrande in Hong Kong in June 2022 in a bid to recover part of its losses.\nThe court has appointed Alvarez and Marsal as liquidator to manage the company, Evergrande said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. It will have powers to seize Evergrande assets in Hong Kong \u2014 such as the group\u2019s office tower located in the commercial district of Wan Chai \u2014 and sell them to raise funds, but the implications for the company\u2019s vast business in mainland China are unclear.\nEvergrande CEO Xiao En told state media on Monday that the liquidation order doesn\u2019t affect the operations of subsidies that are \u201cindependent legal entities,\u201d including its main property development business, Hengda Real Estate Group, which has most of its assets in mainland China.\n\u201cAt present, the management and operation systems of Hengda Real Estate Group and other domestic and overseas subsidiaries as independent legal entities remain unchanged,\u201d he told the 21st Century Business Herald.\nThat\u2019s because the legal systems of Hong Kong and China remain distinct, despite Beijing\u2019s growing control over the former British colony in recent years.\n\u201cToday\u2019s liquidation order will have very limited immediate impact on Evergrande\u2019s onshore operations or assets,\u201d said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Hong Kong-based Kaiyuan Capital.\nHong Kong and the mainland city of Shenzhen \u2014 where Evergrande is based \u2014 have a mutual insolvency recognition agreement, but it\u2019s \u201ceffectively inoperative\u201d and courts in the city are \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d to recognize the offshore liquidator, Silvers said.\n\u201cTo do so would threaten the availability of Evergrande\u2019s onshore assets to resolve its onshore obligations. Onshore, Evergrande tomorrow will be much like Evergrande yesterday,\u201d he said.\nAnother blow to investor confidence\nChinese markets were mixed on Monday in the wake of the liquidation order, with Hong Kong stocks rising but indexes in Shanghai and Shenzhen falling again, after a brief respite last week from a protracted rout.\nSince their recent peaks in February 2021, about $6 trillion \u2014 equivalent to roughly twice Britain\u2019s annual economic output \u2014 has been wiped off the value of Chinese and Hong Kong stocks.\nWhile the fate of the wider company may still be unclear, Evergrande\u2019s winding-up order is another blow to investor sentiment. If mainland China doesn\u2019t recognize the liquidation order, international creditors are likely to suffer heavy losses on their exposure to Evergrande.\n\u201cEvergrande\u2019s offshore liquidation was mostly expected, but it\u2019s still a significant setback for an already troubled onshore real estate sector, one which will further decay investor sentiment,\u201d Silvers said.\nChinese developers face $100 billion in maturing obligations this year and local governments\u2019 financing arms also have $650 billion worth of debt due. Meanwhile, the real estate crisis has started to spill over into the wider financial system because of the exposure of shadow banks to the sector.\n\u201cGiven all of these impending solvency issues, Evergrande\u2019s creditors will likely face a near wipe-out. All of which contributes to the current crisis of confidence in China\u2019s capital markets,\u201d Silvers added.\nApart from the record downturn in real estate, investors are also concerned about Chinese deflation, debt, a falling birthrate and shrinking work force, as well as Beijing\u2019s shift towards ideology-driven policies.\nEvergrande, the poster child for China\u2019s property crisis, unveiled a multi-billion-dollar restructuring plan last March.\nBut that plan was derailed in September after Chinese authorities said the company\u2019s founder and chairman Xu Jiayin was suspected of \u201ccrimes\u201d and detained by the police.\nThe spiralling property crisis has struck a hard blow to the Chinese economy.\nFor decades, China\u2019s robust growth had been propelled by a housing boom fuelled by a growing population and rapid urbanisation. The industry accounted for as much as 30% of the country\u2019s GDP, and more than two-thirds of Chinese household wealth is tied up in real estates.\nBut the sector fell into trouble after the government clamped down on excessive borrowing by developers in 2020 in an attempt to cool the property bubble. Since then, dozens of Chinese developers have defaulted on their debts.\nThe industry has since become a drag on the broader economy, which is grappling with a slow recovery from three years of pandemic lockdowns and a series of headwinds, from record high youth unemployment to mounting financial stress at local governments.\nIn December, new home prices fell by the highest amount in nearly nine years, and property investment slumped 9.6% in 2023 from the previous year, marking a second straight year of declines.\nLucas Lilieholm contributed to reporting.\nThis story has been updated with new information."

Formerly China\u2019s richest man, he was also barred from the securities markets for life.\nThe findings were revealed after an eight-month-long investigation by the CSRC.\nThe investigation had previously derailed Evergrande\u2019s debt restructuring talks with its overseas bondholders in the fall, because the company couldn\u2019t issue new notes, according to a company statement issued in September.\nDays later, Evergrande said its chairman had been detained by Chinese authorities on suspicion of \u201ccrimes.\u201d In January 2024, a Hong Kong court ordered Evergrande to liquidate.\nIn Monday\u2019s filing, Hengda said the CSRC accused the company of several violations, including inflating sales in its financial reports, relying on these allegedly falsified figures to sell bonds and failing to disclose relevant information as required.\nThe regulator said Hengda had fabricated 214 billion yuan ($30 billion) in sales for 2019, which accounted for half of that year\u2019s revenue. Another 350 billion yuan ($48.6 billion) in sales for 2020, accounting for 78% of revenue, were also falsified.\nAs a result, 2019\u2019s net profit was inflated by 63% and 2020\u2019s net profit by 87%, it said.\nThe alleged fraud, amounting to a total of 564.1 billion yuan ($78 billion) over two years, is the largest ever financial fraud case in mainland China\u2019s securities markets, according to previous regulatory statements and state media reports.\nIn addition to the penalties levied on Hengda and Xu, six other executives were fined by the CSRC for being \u201cdirectly responsible.\u201d\nLike Xu, Xia Haijun, the former vice chairman and CEO of Evergrande Group, was banned from the nation\u2019s securities markets for life.\n\u201cXu Jiayin had made decisions, organized, and implemented the financial fraud \u2026 Xia Haijun had organized, arranged and prepared the falsified financial reports\u2026 their means were really bad and the circumstances were grave,\u201d the regulator said."

      "text": "The world is still waiting to find out what will happen to troubled Chinese conglomerate Evergrande and its enormous mountain of debt.\nThe property developer\u2019s debt crisis is a major test for Beijing. Some analysts fear it could even turn into China\u2019s Lehman Brothers moment, sending shockwaves across the world\u2019s second biggest economy. Real estate \u2014 and related industries \u2014 account for as much as 30% of Chinese GDP.\nLast week, investors experienced whiplash as the firm met one crucial debt deadline, but then failed to address another. Shares shot up one day, and down the next.\nThe coming days and weeks will be critical. So far, Evergrande has failed to publicly address two interest payments on bonds over the past week.\nThat\u2019s fueling speculation over what could happen next, with potential outcomes including a Beijing-backed bailout, restructuring or default.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Evergrande, and how it got to where it is now.\nWhat is Evergrande?\nEvergrande is one of China\u2019s largest real estate developers. The company is part of the Global 500 \u2014 meaning that it\u2019s also one of the world\u2019s biggest businesses by revenue.\nListed in Hong Kong and based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, it employs about 200,000 people. It also indirectly helps sustain more than 3.8 million jobs each year.\nThe group was founded by Chinese billionaire Xu Jiayin, also known as Hui Ka Yan in Cantonese, who was once the country\u2019s richest man.\nEvergrande made its name in residential property \u2014 it boasts that it \u201cowns more than 1,300 projects in more than 280 cities\u201d across China \u2014 but its interests extend far beyond that.\nOutside housing, the group has invested in electric vehicles, sports and theme parks. It even owns a food and beverage business, selling bottled water, groceries, dairy products and other goods across China.\nIn 2010, the company bought a soccer team, which is now known as Guangzhou Evergrande. That team has since built what is believed to be the world\u2019s biggest soccer school, at a cost of $185 million to Evergrande.\nGuangzhou Evergrande continues to reach for new records: It\u2019s currently working on creating the world\u2019s biggest soccer stadium, assuming that construction is completed next year as expected. The $1.7 billion site is shaped as a giant lotus flower, and will eventually be able to seat 100,000 spectators.\nEvergrande also caters to tourists through its theme park division, Evergrande Fairyland. Its claim to fame is a massive undertaking called Ocean Flower Island in Hainan, the tropical province in China commonly referred to as the \u201cChinese Hawaii.\u201d\nThe project includes an artificial island with malls, museums and amusement parks. According to the group\u2019s most recent annual report, it started taking customers on a trial basis earlier this year, with plans for a full opening \u201cat the end of 2021.\u201d\nHow did it run into trouble?\nIn recent years, Evergrande\u2019s debts ballooned as it borrowed to finance its various pursuits.\nThe group has gained infamy for becoming China\u2019s most indebted developer, with more than $300 billion worth of liabilities. Over the last few weeks, it\u2019s warned investors of cash flow issues, saying that it could default if it\u2019s unable to raise money quickly.\nThat warning was underscored this month, when Evergrande disclosed in a stock exchange filing that it was having trouble finding buyers for some of its assets.\nIn some ways, the company\u2019s aggressive ambitions are what landed it in hot water, according to experts. The group \u201cstrayed far from its core business, which is part of how it got into this mess,\u201d said Mattie Bekink, China director of the Economist Intelligence Unit.\nGoldman Sachs analysts say the company\u2019s structure has also made it \u201cdifficult to ascertain a more precise picture of [its] recovery.\u201d In a recent note, they pointed to \u201cthe complexity of Evergrande Group, and the lack of sufficient information on the company\u2019s assets and liabilities.\u201d\nBut the group\u2019s struggles are also emblematic of underlying risks in China.\n\u201cThe story of Evergrande is the story of the deep [and] structural challenges to China\u2019s economy related to debt,\u201d said Bekink.\nThe issue isn\u2019t entirely new. Last year, a slew of Chinese state-owned companies defaulted on their loans, raising fears about China\u2019s reliance on debt-fueled investments to support growth.\nAnd in 2018, billionaire Wang Jianlin was forced to downsize his conglomerate, Dalian Wanda, as Beijing clamped down on firms borrowing heavily to push overseas.\nIn a recent note, Mark Williams, Capital Economics\u2019 chief Asia economist, said that Evergrande\u2019s collapse \u201cwould be the biggest test that China\u2019s financial system has faced in years.\u201d\n\u201cThe root of Evergrande\u2019s troubles \u2014 and those of other highly-leveraged developers \u2014 is that residential property demand in China is entering an era of sustained decline,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEvergrande\u2019s ongoing collapse has focused attention on the impact a wave of property developer defaults would have on China\u2019s growth.\u201d\nHow is it trying to move forward?\nThe company somewhat placated investors last week after saying that issues regarding a payment on a domestic yuan bond had been \u201csettled through negotiations.\u201d\nThe amount of interest it owed on the bond is about 232 million yuan ($36 million), according to data from Refinitiv.\nBut many questions still remain unanswered. Evergrande did not elaborate on the terms of the payment, and interest worth $83.5 million on a dollar-denominated bond also fell due last Thursday. That deadline came and went without an update from the company.\nThe firm also announced Wednesday that it would sell part of its stake in a local bank for roughly $1.5 billion, raising some much needed cash.\nBut instead of going toward its outstanding bond interest payments, the money will likely be used to settle its debts with that lender, Shengjing Bank. The conglomerate said it would still hang on to a 14.75% stake after the deal closes.\nEvergrande faced another bond interest payment of nearly $50 million Wednesday, though as of noon local time on Thursday it had stayed silent on the status of that debt.\nOn September 14, Evergrande announced that it had brought on financial advisers to help assess the situation.\nWhile those firms are tasked with exploring \u201call feasible solutions\u201d as quickly as possible, Evergrande has cautioned that nothing is guaranteed.\nSo far, the conglomerate has struggled to stem the bleeding, and has failed to find buyers for parts of its electric vehicle and property services businesses.\nAs of that filing, it had made \u201cno material progress\u201d in its search for investors, and \u201cit is uncertain as to whether the group will be able to consummate any such sale,\u201d it said.\nThe electric car company has addressed how those challenges have trickled down, with a disclosure this week that it was having trouble paying suppliers. It also called off plans to sell new shares in Shanghai.\nOn top of that, the group has been trying to sell off its office tower in Hong Kong, which it bought for about $1.6 billion in 2015. But that has \u201cnot been completed within the expected timetable,\u201d it said in mid-September.\nHow are investors reacting?\nEvergrande\u2019s problems spilled onto the streets this month when protests broke out at its headquarters in Shenzhen. Footage from Reuters showed scores of demonstrators at the site last week, accosting someone identified to be a company representative.\nBut shareholders have been wary for months: The stock has shed nearly 85% of its value this year.\nEarlier this month, Fitch and Moody\u2019s Investors Services both downgraded Evergrande\u2019s credit ratings, citing its liquidity issues. \u201cWe view a default of some kind as probable,\u201d Fitch wrote in a recent note.\nFitch doubled down on that view with a further downgrade on Tuesday, saying that the group was \u201clikely to have missed [an] interest payment on its senior unsecured notes.\u201d\nThe situation also appears to be spooking investors in China more broadly, at a time when they\u2019re already reeling from Beijing\u2019s crackdown on private sector companies, particularly in the tech sector. Stocks in Hong Kong, New York and other major markets have been swayed by fears of contagion from Evergrande and a slowdown in Chinese growth.\n\u201cIn our opinion, how Evergrande credit stresses will be resolved will drive market sentiment,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts wrote recently, referring to the credit market and the broader economy. They added that the Chinese bond market could be hit and a loss of confidence could \u201cspill over to the broader property sector.\u201d\nWhat could happen next?\nThe Chinese government appears to be starting to intervene.\nOver the past few days, the People\u2019s Bank of China has injected some cash into the financial system, to help settle nerves. On Tuesday alone, it added 100 billion yuan (approximately $15.5 billion), saying it was to keep liquidity going.\nIn a statement this week, the central bank also vowed to \u201cmaintain the healthy development of the real estate market, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of housing consumers.\u201d\nIt doubled down on that message Wednesday in a meeting jointly held with regulators, where authorities emphasized the need to not use \u201creal estate as a short-term [tool for] economic stimulus,\u201d according to a central bank statement.\nOfficials also directed the financial sector to focus on stabilizing land and housing prices, adding that institutions should work with \u201clocal governments to jointly maintain the steady and healthy development of the real estate market.\u201d\nAuthorities are clearly watching closely, while attempting to project calm.\nThis month, Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics, acknowledged the difficulties of \u201csome large real estate companies,\u201d according to state media.\nWithout naming Evergrande directly, Fu said that China\u2019s real estate market had remained stable this year but the impact of recent events \u201con the development of the whole industry needs to be observed.\u201d\nEarlier this month, Bloomberg also cited anonymous sources as saying that regulators had enlisted international law firm King & Wood Mallesons, among other advisers, to examine the conglomerate\u2019s finances. King & Wood Mallesons declined to comment.\nAccording to the report, officials in Evergrande\u2019s home province of Guangdong have already rejected a bailout request from its founder. Guangdong authorities and Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment.\nBeijing has few good choices. It will want to protect the thousands of people who have bought unfinished apartments, as well as construction workers, suppliers and small investors.\nIn China, real estate, and its related industries, account for as much as 20% of the urban workforce, according to Christina Zhu, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\nAuthorities will also likely aim to limit the risk of other real estate firms going under. But at the same time, they have long been trying to rein in excessive borrowing by developers \u2014 and won\u2019t want to dilute that message.\nEven with cash infusions, some suggest it may already be too late to save the company.\nEvergrande\u2019s financial problems have been widely dubbed by Chinese media as \u201ca huge black hole,\u201d implying that no amount of money can resolve the issue.\n\u201cChina has really been trying to clean up its bad corporate debt for years. And although they made some progress before the pandemic, the task often seems interminable, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re certainly seeing here,\u201d said Bekink.\n\u201cThe impacts from a large default by Evergrande would be remarkable.\u201d\n\u2014 Kristie Lu Stout, Julia Horowitz, Laura He and CNN\u2019s Beijing bureau contributed to this report."

With over $300 billion in liabilities, the company has faced significant setbacks, including the detention of its founder and ongoing investigations into financial fraud. The liquidation order is expected to further destabilize China's struggling property sector, which has already been impacted by a crackdown on excessive borrowing and a decline in home prices.",
