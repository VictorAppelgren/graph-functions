  "content": "Private equity (PE) operations are reportedly struggling to raise funds despite offering investors unheard-of incentives.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nFundraising among PE firms came to just $592 billion in the 12 months to June, the lowest total in seven years, the Financial Times (FT) reported Sunday (Aug. 24), citing data from Preqin.\n\nThis downturn happened even with PE outfits offering discounts like management fee cuts, \u201cearly-bird discounts\u201d for investors who sign on quickly to new funds and other enticements.\n\nThey \u201care offering a smorgasbord of discounts,\u201d said Marco Masotti, global head of private equity fundraising at law firm Paul Weiss, who added that PE firms were \u201cfacing mounting fee pressure and agreeing to a cascade of discounts.\u201d\n\nFundraising among PE firms is down by almost a third from unprecedented levels in 2021. Higher interest rates and a slowing dealmaking have left PE outfits unable to sell off trillions of dollars worth of aging investments, the report said. This has led to increasing frustration among investors, many of whom are now refusing to back funds.\n\nThe FT noted that dealmakers had hoped that the election of Donald Trump, coupled with a rise in deregulation, would lead to a boom in activity.\n\n\u201cThat acceleration hasn\u2019t materialized the way we had expected,\u201d said Gabrielle Joseph, a managing director for Rede Partners, a private equity fundraising advisory firm.\n\nInstead, the White House\u2019s tariffs have helped worsen the challenges facing the PE sector, helping cool activity near the end of the first quarter. The report cited a Campbell Lutyens survey from April found that 33% of limited partners planned to slow their private market investments in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariffs, while 8% were choosing an all-out pause.\n\nWriting about the tariff situation last week, PYMNTS pointed to the pressures facing companies dependent on goods like Swiss watches and Brazilian coffee.\n\n\u201cUnless they pivot on sourcing or cut expenses elsewhere, somebody has to eat those costs, and 70% of tariff-related costs will be passed on to shoppers through higher prices, Goldman Sachs assumes,\u201d that report said. \u201cRight now, consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate of 18.3%, the highest since 1934, according to the Yale Budget Lab, equivalent to an average household income loss of $2,400.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) are showing more optimism than they did when the tariffs were first announced. While 68% of micro-SMBs said in February and March that they were confident in their survival over the next two years, that figure had climbed to 75% by June, PYMNTS Intelligence research has found.",

      "text": "Now, the world\u2019s other dealmakers are hoping his return to the White House will lead to an uptick in \u201cmegamergers,\u201d the Financial Times reported Thursday (Dec. 19).\nThe global value of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is up 11% this year, in contrast to 2022 when dealmaking missed the $3 trillion mark for the first time in a decade, the report said. Megadeals \u2014 worth more than $5 billion \u2014 rose 19% even as the total number of deals dropped.\n\u201cEspecially for large-deal M&A, it\u2019s mostly about CEO and board confidence levels and \u2014 putting your politics aside for a minute \u2014 there is a lot of optimism among CEOs for their businesses with the new administration,\u201d said Tony Kim, co-president of investment banking at Centerview Partners, per the report.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can make a call on [it being] a gangbuster year in 2025, but certainly there are a lot of signs that point to that,\u201d he added, according to the report.\nMeanwhile, dealmakers are hopeful that the Trump White House will be more relaxed about big mergers after the stricter regulatory stance of the President Joe Biden administration, the report said.\nThe past year has seen some colossal M&A deals, such as Capital One\u2019s agreement to buy Discover Financial for $35.3 billion and Mars\u2019 almost $36 billion purchase of Kellanova.\nMeanwhile, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon predicted last week that dealmaking in equities, mergers and acquisitions in 2025 could surpass 10-year averages.\nThe digital asset space also views Trump as an avenue to prosperity after a Biden administration crackdown.\nThe price of bitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, hit record highs this week after the incoming president said during an interview that his presidency would adopt pro-crypto policies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna do something great with crypto because we don\u2019t want China, or anybody else \u2026 but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead,\u201d Trump told CNBC, adding that his plans include creating a strategic reserve, similar to America\u2019s oil reserve."

      "text": "One the one hand, the current administration\u2019s shifting tariffs on imported goods and commodities ranging from Swiss watches and Brazilian coffee to Canadian aluminum and steel are a blow to companies reliant on those items. Unless they pivot on sourcing or cut expenses elsewhere, somebody has to eat those costs. and 70% of tariff-related costs will be passed on to shoppers through higher prices, Goldman Sachs assumes. Right now, consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate of 18.3%, the highest since 1934, according to the Yale Budget Lab, equivalent to an average household income loss of $2,400.\nOn the other hand, America\u2019s smaller businesses are feeling newly chipper.\nAs of early June, more than 8 in 10 small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) were confident in their ability to remain operational two years from now, a recent PYMNTS Intelligence report found. This data point, captured in an early-June survey detailed in \u201cSmall Business Growth Monitor Q2 2025: From Headwinds to Hope on Main Street,\u201d marks the highest share since PYMNTS Intelligence began tracking business sentiment over three years ago, in July 2022.\nEven more striking: Small business confidence spiked at a time when uncertainty about the Trump administration\u2019s flip-flop approach to global trade swelled with off-again, on-again levies and start-and-stop negotiations with major trading partners. Just four months prior in early February, before the April \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs were announced and other \u201creciprocal\u201d duties hadn\u2019t yet emerged, nearly 1 in 5 smaller businesses were pessimistic about their survival. Almost 7% thought they might not make it.\nBut by early June, the picture was a lot brighter, with only 5.3% deeming survival unlikely. Even the tiniest firms, micro-SMBs with annual revenues under $150,000, are riding this new wave of optimism, with 3 in 4 indicating they are very or extremely likely to survive the next two years \u2014 a solid increase from 68% in March and February.\nConfidence With Tripwires\nTo be sure, it\u2019s not all puppies and rainbows.\nMid-sized businesses with annual revenues between $150,000 and $1 million saw a slight decrease in confidence in June compared to March, when the second-most recent survey was conducted. Industries like construction and utilities, along with independent retailers, are generally seeing improved financial health, while hospitality businesses are struggling the most.\nBut while micro SMBs pulled overall confidence up, 14% reported being worse off financially than six months ago, double the rate of high-revenue SMBs. These smallest firms are typically disproportionately affected by rising costs for imported goods or services, poor cash flow and late customer payments.\nThere\u2019s more. Just over 8 in 10 small business owners who applied for a business loan or line of credit within the last year found it difficult to access affordable capital, a Goldman Sachs report said in June.\nForces at Play\nThe big mystery is, with the economic headwinds, why are many of America\u2019s small businesses newly optimistic? Several factors are at play.\nFirst, consumers. They\u2019re not locking up their pocketbooks, at least not yet. Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows that they nudged up their spending by 0.3% in June, mostly on food, beverages, clothing and shoes, and recreational goods. That slight increase, after flat spending in May, coincided with an equal rise in disposable income. When money came in the door, people spent it, both on essential categories and discretionary items related to experiences and personal care (areas where many small businesses, like nail salons and summer camps, excel). Four in 10 SMBs reported benefiting from rising demand, the PYMNTS Intelligence report shows.\nNext, business boot-strapping. The report found that larger SMBs saw gains from introducing new products and services and from efficiency-boosting technology upgrades. Meanwhile, the smallest firms were more likely to emphasize better marketing and customer outreach.\nNext, competitive advantages. Andrew Clarke, the president and founder of Ground Floor Partners, a small business consulting firm in Chicago, said Thursday that some of his clients in construction, plumbing and electrical services had kept their prices higher than the competition for years because they can justify that by offering better customer service. If their costs rise due to tariffs, he said, \u201cthey just can reduce their margins\u201d and still do well.\nThen there\u2019s Uncle Sam. In July, the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d made a lucrative tax deduction enjoyed by many small businesses and self-employed individuals permanent (it was due to end on Dec. 31). It also increased the deduction starting next year and made it easier to qualify for. While that legislation came after the June survey days, small business likely already knew it was in the works, after the Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved a permanent, expanded deduction in May, making blessing by the Republican-controlled Senate in July a slam dunk.\nThe deduction allows small business owners to deduct up to 20% of their \u201cqualified,\u201d meaning core, business income, which reduces their taxable income and thus what they owe to the Internal Revenue Service. Starting next year, they can deduct 23%.\nPayment Industry Dividend\nFor the payments industry, the overall small business optimism is a good sign. When SMBs are ready to thrive and grow, they often invest in digital technologies: contactless payments, integrated online checkout, better point-of-sale systems and faster funding solutions. They look for partners who can offer flexible, secure and scalable payment methods. As businesses open new locations, launch eCommerce platforms or expand their service offerings, their need for seamless, cost-effective payments grows in lock step. That\u2019s the silver lining in the tariffs cloud.\nOf course, consumers will have to keep spending if small businesses are to grow their sales and merchant accounts and boost demand for their value-added services. And it\u2019s still early in the tariffs game to see how the levies might drive down consumption. Still, the current sentiment suggests an opportunity to support these businesses, not just with payment processing, but with broader tools including analytics, financing and fraud protection.\n\u201cSmall businesses are no strangers to adversity \u2014 resilience is in their DNA,\u201d said Dave Charest, the director of small business success at Constant Contact, a digital marketing platform. \u201cWhat sets them apart is their ability to stay close to their customers, adapt quickly and deliver real value.\u201d"

      "text": "Even amid broad economic uncertainty due to the Trump administration\u2019s global trade agenda, many small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the United States are now feeling good about their near-term future. More than eight in 10 said in early June that they expect to still be in operation two years from now, the highest share since PYMNTS Intelligence began tracking business confidence just over three years ago. It\u2019s a significant shift from only four months ago. In early February, when global tariffs were in the air but the April \u201cLiberation Day\u201d levies regime hadn\u2019t yet unfolded, nearly one in five smaller businesses were pessimistic about their odds of survival. Nearly 7% said they might not make it. By early June, just 5.3% said it was likely they won\u2019t survive.\nBut the newly rosier outlook isn\u2019t spread evenly across all businesses. Much depends on a business\u2019s size and industry. Construction and utilities firms, as well as independent retailers, are by and large seeing improved financial health. While the smallest and largest of SMBs are feeling more optimistic, mid-sized businesses (those with annual revenues between $150,000 and $1 million) saw a slight decrease in confidence in June compared to prior months. Hospitality businesses, including hotels and restaurants, are struggling the most.\nA recent, small boost in consumer spending may have helped business outlooks.\nThe fresh data comes as consumers slightly boosted their spending in June by 0.3%, Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows. The increase, driven by slightly more purchases of food, beverages, apparel and recreational goods, came alongside an identical-sized uptick in disposable income. It seems that as consumers weather economic uncertainty and maintain their spending in certain categories, particularly essentials and discretionary items related to experiences and personal care, some SMBs are showing resilience amid widespread uncertainty about the economy and consumer spending.\nMore positive outlook notwithstanding, things are far from uniformly smooth sailing. Rising costs of imported goods, services and labor pose challenges, hurting some SMBs\u2019 financial health.\nThese are just some of the findings detailed in \u201cSmall Business Growth Monitor Q2 2025: From Headwinds to Hope on Main Street,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence exclusive report. This edition examines the current financial health of SMBs and their future expectations. It draws on insights from a survey of 513 SMBs conducted from June 2, 2025, to June 17, 2025.\nSMBs Are More Optimistic Than Ever About Their Long-Term Survival\nSmall businesses are the backbone of the American economy, with nearly 35 million driving close to half (43.5%) of U.S. GDP, Small Business Administration data shows. As independent retailers, accounting firms, mom-and-pop restaurants, local construction firms and the like, so goes the nation\u2019s financial health, making the sector a bellwether of consumer spending and economic growth.\nSMBs are more optimistic about their future than they\u2019ve been in three years. As of early June, the vast majority\u201482%\u2014expected to be still operating two years from now. This marks the highest share on record since PYMNTS Intelligence began tracking SMB sentiment in July 2022. It is also a significant uptick from the 76% who said this in early February. Additionally, 12% now believe it is only somewhat likely that they will survive the next two years, compared to 17% in the February survey. Just 5.3% now say they are only slightly or not at all likely to survive, compared to 6.9% in the February survey. It seems that, for the time being, SMBs are feeling better about their prospects.\nA significant component of the recent rise in confidence is the micro-SMB segment\u2014businesses with $150,000 or less in annual revenue. Among these tiny companies, three in four say they are very or extremely likely to survive the next two years. While this share is smaller than that of larger SMBs, it marks a solid increase from 68% in both March and February. Among large SMBs with revenues exceeding $1 million, the confidence share held flat at 91%.\nBy contrast, medium-sized SMBs with revenues between $150,000 and $1 million saw a slight decrease in optimism. The share reporting high levels of confidence fell to 83% in June from 87% in March.\nGrowing Demand, Cost-Control Measures and Savvy Marketing Strategies Are Fueling SMBs\u2019 Resilience\nBolstering this confidence, a range of variables is positively affecting SMBs\u2019 performance, from exogenous factors to the strategic decisions companies have recently made about their operations. For SMBs of all sizes, increased customer demand is the most common positive contributor. All told, 40% of SMBs say they are seeing benefits from rising demand. Consumers have recently stated that they may reduce their purchases of certain goods and services if tariffs, many of which took effect on Aug. 7, drive up inflation. But they have also indicated that they plan to stick to some of their discretionary spending, particularly on household and lifestyle items, personal care products and extracurricular activities for children\u2014areas where many small businesses, such as nail salons and summer camps, excel.\nOther favorable factors include reduced operating costs and more effective marketing.\nThe largest SMBs (those with more than $1 million in annual revenue) are the most likely to benefit from introducing new products and services and from efficiency-boosting technology upgrades. The smallest firms (with annual revenues of less than $150,000) are more likely to cite more effective marketing or customer outreach.\nIn general, an SMB\u2019s financial health is boosted by factors both within its control, such as internal technology upgrades and marketing, and outside its reins, such as the level of customer demand and improved supplier terms.\nDespite Widespread Confidence, Micro-SMBs Are Facing Cost and Cash Flow Challenges\nBut while micro-SMBs are increasingly optimistic, a few are the most likely to be facing declining financial health. Specifically, 14% report being worse off financially than they were six months earlier. This percentage is double the share of high-revenue SMBs that said the same.\nConstruction and utilities businesses report being the most financially stable. Nearly two in three said in June that they\u2019re doing better than they were six months ago. This share is 20% higher than the cross-industry average. Conversely, hospitality businesses such as hotels and restaurants are struggling the most. Nearly one in four is worse off than they were six months ago.\nRising costs for imported goods or for services, poor cash flow and late customer payments disproportionately affect micro-SMBs. Among firms with annual revenues less than $150,000, 38% say higher goods and service costs have negatively impacted them. This share is considerably higher than the three in 10 SMBs with revenues of more than $1 million that said the same. The gap may be due in part to smaller businesses having less negotiating power with suppliers favoring larger businesses. Additionally, 18% of micro-SMBs report being hurt by poor cash flow or late customer payments. This figure is twice the share of high-revenue SMBs that said the same.\nMeanwhile, the largest SMBs are now the hardest hit by rising labor costs and by supply chain disruptions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, wages and salaries in June were up 1% from three months prior. Nearly one in four SMBs are negatively impacted by labor cost inflation, vs. just 12% of micro-SMBs. Additionally, 15% are adversely affected by supply chain disruptions compared to just 8.6% of micro-SMBs.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the consumer trends driving innovation in consumer finance, digital payments and financial inclusion.

      "text": "In a report Sunday (June 8) following the industry\u2019s annual European conference, the Financial Times (FT) said private equity (PE) executives were prioritizing other methods for exiting their investments, including breaking up businesses to sell them off in smaller pieces or selling companies to themselves through \u201ccontinuation funds.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember in my 20 years of growth equity investing, not having an IPO window open for this kind of long period of time,\u201d said General Atlantic Co-President Gabriel Caillaux. \u201cThat is obviously calling us to rethink not strategy, but some tactical aspects.\u201d\nAccording to the report, buyout firms have amassed a record backlog of unsold assets, as higher interest rates and market turmoil have made it tougher to take companies public or sell at acceptable prices, pressuring them to find other ways to provide returns to investors.\nThe volume of private equity-backed IPOs has fallen since the heyday of 2021, with just nine this year in Europe and the U.S., versus 116 in the same period in 2021.\nThe head of PE at one large firm told the FT that IPOs now ranked behind break-ups and minority stake sales as an exit option.\n\u201cThe IPO is number three on the list these days,\u201d this executive said. \u201cThe toolbox is really being opened now.\u201d\nThe report also noted that executives had hoped the election of President Donald Trump would usher in an IPO revival. Instead, the president\u2019s policy volatility has closed the capital markets to most potential issuers, the FT added.\nIn fact, a separate report last month from the news outlet noted that the current market volatility had led to a resurgence in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). As of that writing, 44 SPAC offerings had raised $9 billion for the year, compared with 57 companies raising $9.6 billion during the whole of 2024.\nAmong the companies going public this year via the traditional route are Circle, which last week became the U.S.\u2019s first publicly traded stablecoin issuer.\nBut despite \u201cthe fanfare, Circle faces several challenges,\u201d PYMNTS wrote. \u201cFirst, the stablecoin market is becoming competitive. Those very same blue chip banks that helped take Circle public are themselves considering becoming stablecoin issuers.\u201d\nAs covered here last month, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are exploring the launch of a jointly operated stablecoin."

      "text": "That\u2019s according to a report Monday (Aug. 11) from Bloomberg News, citing research from Goldman Sachs.\nWhile U.S. companies have so far absorbed the brunt of the impact of the White House\u2019s tariffs, consumers will soon feel more pressure as companies raise prices, the bank\u2019s economists said.\nWhile consumers have \u2014 as of the end of June \u2014 absorbed roughly 22% of tariff costs, that figure will jump to 67% should the newest levies follow in the path of earlier tariffs, the economists said.\nThe Bloomberg report notes this will lead to faster inflation. The core personal consumer expenditure index, a key Federal Reserve inflation metric, is projected to reach 3.2% year-on-year in December, according to the Goldman report. The analysts said underlying inflation net of tariffs would be 2.4%, down from 2.8% in June.\nThe findings follow last week\u2019s release of the July 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations, from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Center for Microeconomic Data.\nThat report showed that while American consumers feel more optimistic about their finances, they are wary of several other economic factors, with their short- and long-term inflation expectations increasing.\nMeanwhile, research by PYMNTS Intelligence has been tracking the effect of tariffs on consumers. It found, among other things, that nearly a third of consumers had delayed or canceled discretionary buys such as electronics, home d\u00e9cor, or even back-to-school supplies.\nAnd 42% of the surveyed consumers said they now compare prices at three or more retailers before making a purchase, up from 27% in January.\nPYMNTS analysts caution that prolonged periods of out-of-stock items can \u201ctrain\u201d shoppers to regard once-routine purchases as risky, making thrift a long-term habit and eroding lifetime customer value for brands.\n\u201cTariffs are no longer an abstract policy lever,\u201d PYMNTS wrote last week. \u201cThey are a daily pain point at the checkout aisle. Retailers must brace for a consumer who is both price-sensitive and chronically unsure whether the product will even be on the shelf.\u201d\nAnd as covered here last week, the impact of tariffs could stretch beyond higher prices for product goods.\n\u201cFor bankers, payments networks and FinTech platforms, the era of tariffs affects trade\u2011finance credit, supply\u2011chain hedging and working\u2011capital automation,\u201d that report said. \u201cProduct heads must now address new calculations for budgeting capital, currency exposure and re-routing suppliers, functions that tap into fee\u2011generating services, from letters of credit to cross\u2011border virtual accounts to receivables\u2011backed deals.\u201d"

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A), an important measure of global economic health, have stagnated this year.\n\u201cPatience is wearing a little bit thin\u201d among limited partners (LP), said Kevin Desai, PwC U.S. deal platform leader.\nLP companies combine some of the largest and most influential investors in the world and invest trillions of dollars in PE outfits in anticipation of regular returns.\nWhile the year began with the hopes of a M&A boom thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House, deal volume and value have been mostly flat year over year, with 4,535 deals adding up to $567 billion through May, PwC said.\nPwC\u2019s May 2025 Pulse Survey showed that 30% of respondents have either put deals on hold or are revising them because of tariff issues, leading investor discontent over delayed returns.\nIn the first three weeks of April alone \u2014 following the first announcement of Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 preparations for initial public offerings (IPOs) for companies with a combined valuation of over $120 billion were put on hold.\n\u201cIn a typical M&A cycle, $1 trillion would have already been put back into the market,\u201d Josh Smigel, PwC\u2019s U.S. private equity leader, told reporters while sharing the firm\u2019s 2025 midyear forecast on deal activity.\nThe news follows a report from the Financial Times earlier this month on efforts by PE firms to prioritize other methods for exiting their investments. These include breaking up businesses to sell them off in pieces or selling companies to themselves via \u201ccontinuation funds.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember in my 20 years of growth equity investing, not having an IPO window open for this kind of long period of time,\u201d said General Atlantic Co-President Gabriel Caillaux. \u201cThat is obviously calling us to rethink not strategy, but some tactical aspects.\u201d"

Meanwhile, U.S. small and medium\u2011sized businesses report rising confidence despite tariff\u2011driven cost pressures, and overall M&A activity has risen 11% this year, though the number of deals has fallen.  The combination of fee pressure, market volatility and trade policy is reshaping both private\u2011equity fundraising and the broader deal market.",
