      "title": "Democrats say retirement dollars at risk from GOP's anti-ESG approach",
      "summary": "Democratic state officials from New York to California have sent letters to major asset managers urging them to incorporate climate, supply‑chain and governance risks into retirement‑fund investments, countering a GOP push that has branded ESG as a threat to capitalism. The letters call for active fiduciary oversight and reject pressure from the Trump administration to ignore long‑term value creation. Meanwhile, the new Trump executive order expands the range of alternative assets that can be offered in 401(k) plans, sparking debate over whether such investments are appropriate for most workers. The article also traces the broader decline of ESG investing amid Republican attacks, regulatory uncertainty, and shifting market dynamics, noting that while some investors still see value in low‑carbon opportunities, the ESG label has become increasingly contested and diluted.",
