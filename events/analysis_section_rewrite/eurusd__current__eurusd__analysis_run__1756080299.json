      "feedback": "The draft already threads policy credibility (Lagarde) and geopolitical risk into macro/asset dynamics, but to reach world‑class, tighten the 0–3 week frame into a testable causal chain, anchor every claim to a number or explicit trigger, and prune noise. Actionable edits: (i) restructure into a crisp base‑case/near‑term‑c catalysts/invalidations flow, with explicit triggers and thresholds drawn from the sources—e.g., central‑bank independence signals reinforcing inflation anchors if Lagarde’s stance holds (U6HXAJR4J) and near‑term risk premia if Yemen/Israel hostilities escalate (I2SJU04DF); (ii) attach concrete catalysts and published thresholds: immediate news/policy (Lagarde Jackson Hole remarks), near‑term events (Houthis’ missile/sub‑munition activity and Red Sea/energy‑shipping risk with 2,000 km targeting range and “more than 10 fighter jets” cited in I2SJU04DF), and hardware cycle catalysts (Intel Lunar Lake/Claw 8 AI+ announcements) using the MSI Claw A8/Z2 Extreme data (price around €999, 24 GB RAM, 80 Wh battery; Neon Green design) plus the Lunar Lake note (HG440LJN4); (iii) quantify clearly where possible: e.g., baseline risk mood shifts drive risk assets vs. credible policy signaling, with escalation/red‑sea disruption pushing energy and shipping premia higher and supportive policy signaling stabilizing risk assets; (iv) strengthen the causal chain with first‑principles: credibility of independent policy sets inflation expectations; geopolitics drives risk premia and dollar/treasury moves; AI‑hardware cycles shape capex/earnings risk in the near term; (v) add an explicit invalidation point: if Houthi activity abates and ceasefire cues hold, or if Lunar Lake devices prove meaningful performance gains, the near‑term risk tilt reverses; (vi) tighten source discipline: after each factual claim cite only IDs present (U6HXAJR4J; I2SJU04DF; HG440LJN4; 3G1PVPWPD), and drop non‑essential items (Pornhub/YouTube Music chatter) unless you can show a direct horizon 0–3 week market impact; (vii) sharpen the monitoring slate: Red Sea shipping indicators/oil prices, fresh central‑bank commentary, and early Lunar Lake‑driven handheld benchmarks or pre‑order/news, with explicit mention of those data points when they appear (I2SJU04DF; U6HXAJR4J; HG440LJN4; 3G1PVPWPD); (viii) ensure a tight, concise write‑up with numbers first and narrative second to minimize hedging and generic platitudes; (ix) verify no internal contradictions (e.g., independence credibility vs. Powell/Jackson Hole politics) and reconcile any conflicting signals by presenting a conditional, probability‑weighted view; (x) adjust length to keep it strictly horizon‑focused, removing peripheral items (e.g., long‑form non‑macro tech/entertainment notes) unless you can tie them to immediate market translation; (xi) in the final write, explicitly map “watch next for” items to the cited data points (I2SJU04DF; U6HXAJR4J; HG440LJN4; 3G1PVPWPD). This will yield a world‑class, falsifiable 0–3 week analysis with coherent causal transmission, precise catalysts, and rigorous source‑to‑claim mapping.",
