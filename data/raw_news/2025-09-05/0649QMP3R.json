  "title": "LIGO and Google create a new AI tool to supercharge the hunt for gravitational waves",
  "description": "Artificial intelligence is poised to take LIGO's search for gravitational waves to the next level, with Google's help.",
  "content": "The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, has already won its researchers a Nobel Prize \u2014 and now artificial intelligence is poised to take LIGO\u2019s search for cosmic collisions to the next level.\n\nGoogle DeepMind and the LIGO team say they\u2019ve developed an AI tool called Deep Loop Shaping that has been shown to enhance the observatory\u2019s ability to track gravitational waves \u2014 faint ripples in the fabric of spacetime that are thrown off by smash-ups involving black holes and massive neutron stars.\n\nThe researchers describe the technique in a proof-of-concept study published today by the journal Science. They hope to make Deep Loop Shaping part of routine operations at LIGO\u2019s detectors in Louisiana and on the Hanford nuclear site in Washington state.\n\n\u201cDeep Loop Shaping is revolutionary, because it is able to reduce the noise level in the most unstable and most difficult feedback loop at LIGO,\u201d lead author Jonas Buchli, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, told reporters.\n\nThe existence of gravitational waves was predicted by Albert Einstein a century ago, but they were first observed directly only in 2015, using LIGO\u2019s twin 2.5-mile-long interferometers. That feat was recognized with the Nobel Prize in physics in 2017. Since then, the LIGO team has worked to increase the sensitivity of the detectors, but it\u2019s not an easy task.\n\nLIGO\u2019s system of mirrors and precision laser beams have to register spacetime warps that amount to just one-10,000th the width of a proton. At that level of sensitivity, perturbations from distant earthquakes and ocean waves can jiggle the mirrors enough to make a difference in what\u2019s registered by the detectors.\n\nResearchers developed sophisticated techniques \u2014 including some that rely on AI \u2014 to keep the 88-pound mirrors still and cancel out the \u201cnoise\u201d from such perturbations. But compensating for that noise introduces a different kind of disturbance.\n\n\u201cThe hardest problem left is, how do you keep everything so still without disturbing your measurement?\u201d said Rana Adhikari, a member of the LIGO team at Caltech. \u201cThat \u2018controls noise\u2019 has been bedeviling us for decades and decades.\u201d\n\nAdhikari compared the problem to trying to hold a mirror still with your bare hands. \u201cIf you try to keep it really still, your hands start to shake because you\u2019re holding it tightly,\u201d he said. \u201cThis method takes away the shaking.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s engineers worked with LIGO\u2019s scientists to develop software that was trained on simulated gravitational-wave readings, using a process known as reinforcement learning.\n\n\u201cBasically, they were running dozens of simulated LIGOs in parallel,\u201d Adhikari said in a news release. \u201cYou can think of the training as playing a game. You get points for reducing the noise, and dinged for increasing it. The successful \u2018players\u2019 keep going to try to win the game of LIGO. The result is beautiful \u2014 the algorithm works to suppress mirror noise.\u201d\n\nThe proof-of-concept test results, based on an hour\u2019s worth of LIGO data from the detector in Louisiana, showed that Deep Loop Shaping could quiet the motion of the mirrors 30 to 100 times better than traditional noise-reduction methods alone.\n\nStudy co-author Jan Harms, a professor at Italy\u2019s Gran Sasso Science Institute, said the technique could open up a new frontier in astronomy.\n\n\u201cWe are really excited about the potential to advance gravitational-wave science with Deep Loop Shaping,\u201d he said. \u201cMore specifically, what we can now do is open a new frequency band for gravitational-wave observations, toward the low-frequency end.\u201d\n\nHarms said the opportunity was analogous to expanding the range of a telescope to take in infrared or X-rays as well as optical wavelengths. With greater sensitivity at lower frequencies, LIGO could do a better job of detecting the collisions of neutron stars or intermediate-mass black hole binaries. LIGO could also provide more advance warning of imminent cosmic collisions.\n\n\u201cWhat you can do is a pre-merger alert, so you can let people know [that] a minute from now, two neutron stars will merge,\u201d Harms said. \u201cAnd then, if you have just enough detectors online, you can even point to a specific patch in the sky and tell them, \u2018Look there and wait for it.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith all the talk about AI hallucinations, should people be worried that Deep Loop Shaping could produce false data? \u201cI think the question of \u2018Will it misbehave after it\u2019s running a year\u2019 is a legitimate question, but we also worry about that for our classical methods, and so we monitor all of these things,\u201d Adhikari said.\n\n\u201cThis is a new area for us, so I think we\u2019ll be learning as we go along, and we\u2019ll be developing methods to veto any sort of misbehavior, not just from this system, but even our classical systems that do misbehave sometimes,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the next phase of the rollout, the LIGO team plans to put Deep Loop Shaping through longer test runs that could go on for days or weeks at a time \u2014 in Louisiana, at Hanford and eventually at LIGO-India. \u201cThis week is the time when we\u2019re going to start to have those discussions,\u201d Adhikari said.\n\nDeep Loop Shaping, and programs like it, could well become part of the standard engineering toolkit \u2014 not just for gravitational-wave detectors, but also for other applications where components have to be controlled with high precision. \u201cThis is about applications in aerospace, for example,\u201d Harms said. \u201cNavigation or manufacturing, or generally noise reduction in systems, or also civil engineering.\u201d\n\nThe technology might even find its way into noise-canceling headphones. And Buchli said there may be still other applications that engineers haven\u2019t yet thought of.\n\n\u201cI think once we send this out, hopefully some more people come to think, \u2018Oh, actually, gee, I have this really hard control problem. I think I will try that,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nBuchli, Adhikari and Harms are among 30 authors of the Science study, \u201cImproving Cosmological Reach of a Gravitational Wave Observatory Using Deep Loop Shaping.\u201d",

The federal government has operated the Hanford Sites since 1943, maintaining its isolation and limited commercial development. The size of the Hanford Site and its relative isolation helped fuel a new scientific project almost 50 years later.\nIn 1992, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was built near Hanford Site to detect gravitational wave vibrations from outer space. Its instruments, called interferometers, have arms that stretch to about 2.5 miles (4 km) long. The instruments are very sensitive to local vibrations like those from human activity. LIGO selected the Hanford area for one of its two interferometers because Hanford is still relatively isolated from a lot of human activity. The Hanford area also has the required space for the massive scientific project. Scientists use the instruments to help study major stellar events like the collision of black holes.\nLIGO is a modern example of Hanford\u2019s history of high-technology research and scientific discovery that dates to the Manhattan Project and the construction of the B Reactor. The Tri-Cities community is known for scientific and technical innovation, especially in the field of physics.\nThe LIGO Hanford Observatory has an exploration center called LExC and offers tours of its facility.\nContinue Your Journey\nAdditional sites in the Tri-Cities sharing big science stories include the B Reactor, the world\u2019s first full scale nuclear reactor, and the USS Triton Sail, part of a groundbreaking nuclear submarine now preserved and interpreted by the Port of Benton.

      "text": "AI hallucinations are incorrect or misleading results that AI models generate. These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, including insufficient training data, incorrect assumptions made by the model, or biases in the data used to train the model. AI hallucinations can be a problem for AI systems that are used to make important decisions, such as medical diagnoses or financial trading.\nNew customers get up to $300 in free credits to try Vertex AI and other Google Cloud products.\nAI models are trained on data, and they learn to make predictions by finding patterns in the data. However, the accuracy of these predictions often depends on the quality and completeness of the training data. If the training data is incomplete, biased, or otherwise flawed, the AI model may learn incorrect patterns, leading to inaccurate predictions or hallucinations.\nFor example, an AI model that is trained on a dataset of medical images may learn to identify cancer cells. However, if the dataset does not include any images of healthy tissue, the AI model may incorrectly predict that healthy tissue is cancerous.\nFlawed training data is just one reason why AI hallucinations can occur. Another factor that may contribute is a lack of proper grounding. An AI model may struggle to accurately understand real-world knowledge, physical properties, or factual information. This lack of grounding can cause the model to generate outputs that, while seemingly plausible, are actually factually incorrect, irrelevant, or nonsensical. This can even extend to fabricating links to web pages that never existed.\nAn example of this would be an AI model designed to generate summaries of news articles may produce a summary that includes details not present in the original article, or even fabricates information entirely.\nUnderstanding these potential causes of AI hallucinations is important for developers working with AI models. By carefully considering the quality and completeness of training data, as well as ensuring proper grounding, developers may minimize the risk of AI hallucinations and ensure the accuracy and reliability of their models.\nAI hallucinations can take many different forms. Some common examples include:\nWhen training an AI model, it is important to limit the number of possible outcomes that the model can predict. This can be done by using a technique called \"regularization.\" Regularization penalizes the model for making predictions that are too extreme. This helps to prevent the model from overfitting the training data and making incorrect predictions.\nWhen training an AI model, it is important to use data that is relevant to the task that the model will be performing. For example, if you are training an AI model to identify cancer, you should use a dataset of medical images. Using data that is not relevant to the task can lead to the AI model making incorrect predictions.\nWhen training an AI model, it is helpful to create a template for the model to follow. This template can help to guide the model in making predictions. For example, if you are training an AI model to write text, you could create a template that includes the following elements:\nWhen using an AI model, it is important to tell the model what you want and don't want. This can be done by providing the model with feedback. For example, if you are using an AI model to generate text, you can provide the model with feedback by telling it which text you like and don't like. This will help the model to learn what you are looking for.\nLearn how to use Google Cloud to help prevent AI hallucinations:\nStart building on Google Cloud with $300 in free credits and 20+ always free products."
