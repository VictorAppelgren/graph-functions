      "summary": "US President Trump announced imminent substantial chip tariffs, but indicated Apple and similar firms would be exempt, while the Federal Reserve’s Williams signaled a dovish stance and gradual rate cuts ahead of the upcoming Non‑Farm Payrolls report. Equity indices rose (SPX +0.83%, NDX +0.93%), Treasury yields firmed on dovish Fed talk, and the dollar edged higher. Trade data showed a widening deficit, and OPEC‑8 hinted at a production hike, adding pressure to crude prices. The market is poised for a key jobs release next week, with expectations of softer labor data potentially supporting further rate cuts and a rally in risk assets.",
