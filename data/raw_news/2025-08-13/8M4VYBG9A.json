  "title": "We Think You Can Look Beyond Ingersoll Rand's (NYSE:IR) Lackluster Earnings",
  "description": "NYSE:IR 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Ingersoll Rand's Fair Values from the Community and select yours...",
  "content": "Explore Ingersoll Rand's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nInvestors were disappointed with the weak earnings posted by Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR ). Despite the soft profit numbers, our analysis has optimistic about the overall quality of the income statement.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nFor anyone who wants to understand Ingersoll Rand's profit beyond the statutory numbers, it's important to note that during the last twelve months statutory profit was reduced by US$333m due to unusual items. It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. Assuming those unusual expenses don't come up again, we'd therefore expect Ingersoll Rand to produce a higher profit next year, all else being equal.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Ingersoll Rand's Profit Performance\n\nUnusual items (expenses) detracted from Ingersoll Rand's earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Ingersoll Rand's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Unfortunately, though, its earnings per share actually fell back over the last year. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. If you'd like to know more about Ingersoll Rand as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. For example - Ingersoll Rand has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Ingersoll Rand's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\n\nHave feedback on this article?
