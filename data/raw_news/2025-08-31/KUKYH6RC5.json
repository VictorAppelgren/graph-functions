Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways\n\nIn a world dominated by talk of solar panels, wind turbines, and nuclear reactors, some of the most fascinating breakthroughs in energy are happening in unexpected places. Scientists are experimenting with everything from using moisture to break down plastic into usable recycled material, to turning seawater into hydrogen, and even converting banana peels into biogas.\n\nThe future of energy isn't just about creativity, it's also about accessibility. A clean technology only matters if it's affordable enough to be adopted widely. That's why researchers are increasingly looking at low-cost, everyday materials that most of us see as waste. Imagine if the dredges of your morning coffee or the leftovers from a winery could one day fuel cars, buses, or even planes.\n\nWhat once seemed useless might just be the key to fueling the world. So, let's take a look at 10 unexpected energy sources you probably never imagined could be turned into fuel.\n\nRead more: The Real Reason Hydrogen Fuel Isn't More Popular\n\nYour daily caffeine fix might do more than help you live longer \u2014 it could literally power the bus you take to work. It sounds unbelievable, but researchers have discovered that used coffee grounds contain oils suitable for biodiesel production. A London-based startup called Bio-Bean, has already partnered with transport authorities to turn discarded coffee grounds into biofuel for buses.\n\nThe process is simple but brilliant. The grounds are collected from coffee shops, processed to extract oil, and converted into biodiesel. Remarkably, this new fuel works seamlessly in existing diesel engines, so there's no need for costly modifications. This approach is not only efficient, it's also eco-friendly because it reduces waste, lowers emissions and reduces the need for fossil fuels.\n\nBillions of cups of coffee are consumed globally each year, producing massive amounts of waste. If even a fraction of that waste were redirected into fuel, the environmental impact would be enormous.\n\nSeawater Can Be Split Into Hydrogen Fuel\n\nSeawater, which covers more than 70% of our planet, could become a major source of clean energy. At the University of Adelaide, scientists have developed a method to turn seawater into green hydrogen fuel, without the costly removal of the salt content. Traditional electrolysis (splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen) usually requires purified water because salt corrodes the electrodes. By using a specialized non-precious catalyst, the team bypassed this problem.\n\nThe benefits are huge. Green hydrogen is a clean fuel, and producing it directly from seawater lowers costs and energy use. Beyond the lab, companies like Equatic are scaling this idea further, with a process that not only extracts hydrogen fuel but also forces seawater to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, locking it away as stable minerals. This means the ocean doubles as both a carbon sink and a fuel factory.\n\nWhile large-scale adoption is still in progress, this discovery could completely transform energy production, offering a pathway to clean fuel and climate action at the same time.\n\nIt sounds like a science fair prank, but urine can actually generate electricity. Researchers at the University of Bath have developed miniature fuel cells that harness bacteria to break down compounds in urine. As the microbes digest the waste, they release electrons, which flow through a circuit to produce an electric current. A similar idea was explored at Northwestern University to draw nearly limitless energy from the soil using microbial fuel cells.\n\nThis method has been trialed in schools in Kenya and Uganda, where it powers LED lights in bathrooms and even charges small electronics. Beyond the novelty factor, this technology excels in places where grid power is expensive or unreliable, converting waste into a low-cost source of electricity.\n\nWhile the power output is relatively small, it shows how unexpected bio-resources can help real communities meet basic energy needs. Who knew the restroom could be a mini power plant?\n\nTofu might be a protein-packed meal on your plate, but its production leaves behind loads of soybean pulp and wastewater. Instead of letting these byproducts go to waste, scientists have found a way to convert them into biogas using anaerobic digestion. In this oxygen-free process, microorganisms break down organic matter, releasing methane-rich gas that can be used for cooking, heating, or generating electricity.\n\nFactories in Indonesia are already tapping into this system. What's clever is that tofu waste can produce the very energy that keeps tofu-producing factories running. It's cost-effective, sustainable, and reduces dependence on fossil fuels. Unlike high-tech innovations, this solution is relatively straightforward and simply repurposes existing waste materials and technology.\n\nBy turning food waste into fuel, tofu factories demonstrate how circular economies can reshape industries. Not only are they feeding people, they're also powering themselves and contributing to a greener energy grid.\n\nAir travel is a notorious contributor to carbon emissions, but a slimy green solution could change that. Algae, rich in oils and fast-growing in saltwater, is emerging as a powerful candidate for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike crops like corn or soy, algae doesn't compete with food supplies and produces far more oil per acre of land.\n\nWhat makes algae oil especially exciting is its high calorific value, meaning it releases significant energy when burned. Airlines are under pressure to adopt SAF under the European Union's RefuelEU Aviation regulations, which require 2% SAF use by 2025, rising sharply in future decades. Algae biofuel could help to meet this demand without straining agricultural land or freshwater resources.\n\nThis unusual fuel source seems like science fiction, but it's real and faces significant challenges. Large-scale cultivation, affordability, and building supply chains are just some of the hurdles preventing widespread adoption. Still, the vision of planes powered by photosynthetic organisms harvested from the sea is compelling.\n\nCows aren't just milk and beef machines \u2014 they're also renewable energy generators. Their manure, which has always been useful for crops, is now helping to light up houses and run machines. When processed in biogas plants, cow manure breaks down into methane-rich gas that can heat homes, generate electricity, and even fuel vehicles. The leftover material is a nutrient-rich biofertilizer, creating a zero-waste system.\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas, 28 times stronger than carbon dioxide. When released into the atmosphere unchecked, it contributes heavily to global warming. By capturing it for energy, farms prevent harmful emissions while creating usable fuel. For example, in Japan, a biogas facility handles about 250 tons of manure daily, producing 1.2 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 2,200 homes per year.\n\nThis approach turns farms into power plants. Instead of contributing to climate problems, livestock operations can become part of the solution. It's dirty work, but the result is a cleaner environment and a steady source of renewable power.\n\nWine Waste Can Be Fermented Into Ethanol\n\nEvery bottle of wine we enjoy leaves behind a surprisingly large amount of skins, seeds, and stems that are collectively called grape pomace. Traditionally, wineries either discard this material or use small amounts for livestock feed, but researchers are now turning it into bioethanol. By fermenting the natural sugars found in pomace with yeast, ethanol is produced, which can then be blended into fuel for cars or used as a renewable energy source.\n\nThe process has major environmental advantages. Instead of letting grape waste rot in landfills where it would release methane (a powerful greenhouse gas), it's transformed into a clean-burning fuel, helping to reduce reliance on petroleum.\n\nCountries with thriving wine industries such as France, Italy, and Spain are especially well-positioned to scale this technology. With millions of tons of pomace generated annually, the energy potential is vast. What was once winery trash could end up fueling cars, blending sustainability with one of the world's oldest industries.\n\nSlipping on a banana peel is a comedy trope, but in real life those peels can generate energy. When processed in anaerobic digesters, banana waste breaks down to release methane-rich gas, which can be used for cooking and electricity. According to researchers from the Agro-Energy Group at Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (UPM), banana waste can provide up to 55% of the electrical needs of the Ecuadorian province of El Oro.\n\nThe potential is massive. A single kilogram of dried banana peels can produce up to 0.3 cubic meters of biogas \u2014 enough to run a small generator. With more than 125 million metric tons of bananas produced worldwide each year, the fuel capacity is staggering.\n\nUrban markets and food processors throw away tons of banana waste daily. Instead of leaving it to rot in landfills (where it releases methane anyway), centralized digesters can capture that energy for communities. In some regions, researchers are even producing bioethanol from banana waste for vehicles. That means your fruit snack could one day help fuel cars.\n\nWhat happens to the truckloads of tomatoes that spoil before reaching supermarket shelves? Instead of being discarded, scientists have discovered that these rotting tomatoes can actually generate electricity using microbial electrochemical cells. In this system, microbes feed on tomato waste and release electrons during digestion. Electrodes capture those electrons, creating an electric current.\n\nTomatoes are especially useful in this process because they contain lycopene, a natural pigment that improves the transfer of electrons. Even small amounts of waste (just 10 milligrams) can produce about 0.3 watts of power, so imagine the potential in farming regions where tons of produce are often lost due to oversupply or transport issues.\n\nIf farms and processing plants harnessed this method, they could generate energy to power their own facilities instead of paying for costly waste disposal. Microbial fuel cells are still in the early stages of development, but they're a great example of turning food loss into useful energy.\n\nPlastic Waste Can Be Cooked Into Oil\n\nPlastic pollution is one of the world's biggest environmental headaches, but what if trash bags and bottles could be transformed back into fuel? Through a process called pyrolysis, non-recyclable plastics are heated in the absence of oxygen. This breaks their long polymer chains into smaller hydrocarbons, producing pyrolysis oil, which is a viable alternative to gasoline.\n\nUnlike traditional recycling processes, pyrolysis can handle dirty or mixed plastics. Startups such as Petgas in Mexico are already proving the concept, converting 1.5 tons of plastic waste into 356 gallons of fuel in a week. The market for this fuel is currently valued at more than $1.4 billion in the U.S. alone, and it's projected to significantly grow in the next decade.\n\nChallenges remain but pyrolysis offers a promising way to turn a waste crisis into an energy opportunity. Instead of piling up in landfills or choking oceans, plastics could literally keep engines running.\n\nThe promise of waste-to-energy is exciting, but adoption isn't simple. Many of these technologies struggle with high implementation costs, limited infrastructure, and skepticism from policymakers that favor established fuel sources. However, without supportive policies and public buy-in, many of these ideas may remain trapped in laboratories instead of reaching communities.\n\nThe potential payoff of adoption is clear. Diverting food waste into anaerobic digesters would reduce landfill emissions, lower energy costs, and provide decentralized power for small businesses. Plastic-to-fuel plants could reduce both pollution and dependence on imported oil. For rural areas, manure or banana peels could mean reliable electricity without waiting for the grid.\n\nThe shift might take time, but it's worth it. Waste doesn't have to be a liability; it can be a lifeline. By tackling adoption challenges head-on, governments, industries, and communities can turn overlooked byproducts into the building blocks of tomorrow's energy system.\n\nEnjoyed this article?

      "text": "Researchers Discovered How To Break Down Plastic Using Moisture In The Air\nPlastic pollution is one of the biggest environmental challenges of our time, but researchers at Northwestern University may have found a new solution. Their newly developed method can break down plastic using nothing more than moisture from the air, offering a clean, energy-efficient alternative to traditional plastic recycling.\nMost plastic waste, especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET)\u2014which is commonly found in bottles, food containers, and polyester fabrics\u2014doesn't decompose naturally. While recycling exists, current methods require harsh chemicals, high temperatures, and expensive processes, often downcycling plastic into lower-quality materials instead of fully reusing it.\nThe Northwestern team has discovered a way to break down plastic into its original building blocks using a non-toxic, solvent-free process. Their method relies on a molybdenum-based catalyst and activated carbon, which work together to break apart the chemical bonds in PET plastic. The breakthrough, however, is what happens next.\nOnce the plastic is chemically broken down, it is exposed to air. The trace moisture in the atmosphere triggers a reaction that converts the broken plastic into valuable monomers\u2014the essential components that can be recycled into brand-new plastics or even higher-value materials.\nUnlike traditional recycling, this method is safer, cheaper, and more sustainable. It eliminates the need for toxic solvents, excessive energy use, and waste byproducts. The process is also incredibly efficient, recovering 94 percent of usable material within just four hours.\nResearchers tested the system on real-world plastic waste, including bottles, polyester clothing, and mixed plastic products. It worked just as effectively, even removing colors from dyed plastics and leaving behind pure, recyclable material. It could finally be an answer to the ongoing plastic pollution problems that plague our oceans and beaches.\nTo say that this innovation could revolutionize plastic recycling is an understatement. It could finally make it possible to continuously reuse plastic without degrading its quality. The next step for the researchers is to scale up the process for industrial use, ensuring it can handle breaking down large amounts of plastic waste.\nWith plastic waste at an all-time high and microplastic rain now falling from our skies, it's more important than ever to find a solution to this ongoing issue."

      "text": "Ingenious Dirt-Powered Fuel Cell Can Draw Nearly Limitless Energy From Soil\nA team at Northwestern University has created a paperback-sized device that can rest within the soil and draw energy from it. The dirt-powered fuel cell is quite unique and can draw almost limitless energy from the soil it is placed within.\nThe device is what scientists call a microbial fuel cell. These nifty inventions have been around for more than 100 years, and they work very similar to a battery. However, instead of relying on the chemicals a battery does, they instead work with the bacteria found in the soil around them.\nWhile they have been around for a while, scientists have had issues keeping them supplied with water and oxygen when they are buried. The team at Northwestern University hoped to overcome this issue by creating new designs that give the dirt-powered fuel cells continual access to oxygen and water.\nThe design they settled on is large enough to sit deep enough to access moisture from the deep soil, while the top of the device sits flush with the surface of the soil. This creates a fresh air gap that can run down the entire length of the device's electrode. Further, the device is set up to protect the cathode from oxygen and water exposure to help it keep running even during less-than-ideal environmental scenarios.\nThe team reports that this particular design performed consistently across various moisture levels. On average, the device generated 68 times more power than was required to operate the onboard moisture and touch detection systems, the team says. The dirt-powered fuel cell could also transmit data via a tiny antenna to a base station nearby.\nOf course, the power generated here by this device isn't enough to power a full-fledged car or smartphone just yet. However, it could power smaller sensors long-term without requiring battery changes as often. Sure, that isn't the most significant improvement ever, but considering the device pulls energy from the soil around it, that's not a bad deal at all.\nThis and other advancements, like the car that runs off salt water, continue to improve our power generation options. The team published their findings in Proceedings of ACM on Interaction, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies."

A single kilogram of dried banana peels can produce up to 0.3 cubic meters of biogas \u2014 enough to run a small generator. With more than 125 million metric tons of bananas produced worldwide each year, the fuel capacity is staggering.\nUrban markets and food processors throw away tons of banana waste daily. Instead of leaving it to rot in landfills (where it releases methane anyway), centralized digesters can capture that energy for communities. In some regions, researchers are even producing bioethanol from banana waste for vehicles. That means your fruit snack could one day help fuel cars.\nRotten tomatoes can make electricity\nWhat happens to the truckloads of tomatoes that spoil before reaching supermarket shelves? Instead of being discarded, scientists have discovered that these rotting tomatoes can actually generate electricity using microbial electrochemical cells. In this system, microbes feed on tomato waste and release electrons during digestion. Electrodes capture those electrons, creating an electric current.\nTomatoes are especially useful in this process because they contain lycopene, a natural pigment that improves the transfer of electrons. Even small amounts of waste (just 10 milligrams) can produce about 0.3 watts of power, so imagine the potential in farming regions where tons of produce are often lost due to oversupply or transport issues.\nIf farms and processing plants harnessed this method, they could generate energy to power their own facilities instead of paying for costly waste disposal. Microbial fuel cells are still in the early stages of development, but they're a great example of turning food loss into useful energy.\nPlastic waste can be cooked into oil\nPlastic pollution is one of the world's biggest environmental headaches, but what if trash bags and bottles could be transformed back into fuel? Through a process called pyrolysis, non-recyclable plastics are heated in the absence of oxygen. This breaks their long polymer chains into smaller hydrocarbons, producing pyrolysis oil, which is a viable alternative to gasoline.\nUnlike traditional recycling processes, pyrolysis can handle dirty or mixed plastics. Startups such as Petgas in Mexico are already proving the concept, converting 1.5 tons of plastic waste into 356 gallons of fuel in a week. The market for this fuel is currently valued at more than $1.4 billion in the U.S. alone, and it's projected to significantly grow in the next decade.\nChallenges remain but pyrolysis offers a promising way to turn a waste crisis into an energy opportunity. Instead of piling up in landfills or choking oceans, plastics could literally keep engines running.\nTurning waste into watts\nThe promise of waste-to-energy is exciting, but adoption isn't simple. Many of these technologies struggle with high implementation costs, limited infrastructure, and skepticism from policymakers that favor established fuel sources. However, without supportive policies and public buy-in, many of these ideas may remain trapped in laboratories instead of reaching communities.\nThe potential payoff of adoption is clear. Diverting food waste into anaerobic digesters would reduce landfill emissions, lower energy costs, and provide decentralized power for small businesses. Plastic-to-fuel plants could reduce both pollution and dependence on imported oil. For rural areas, manure or banana peels could mean reliable electricity without waiting for the grid.\nThe shift might take time, but it's worth it. Waste doesn't have to be a liability; it can be a lifeline. By tackling adoption challenges head-on, governments, industries, and communities can turn overlooked byproducts into the building blocks of tomorrow's energy system."

      "text": "This Tiny Bug Transforms Food Waste Into Nutrient-Rich Biofertiliser\nWhile they might not win any beauty contests, the black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are making a massive impact by turning food waste into a nutrient-rich biofertilizer known as frass. No, I'm not joking. Bug poop might just save the world, in a manner of speaking.\nRoughly one-third of the planet's soil is degraded. That means traditional farming methods are straining under the weight of chemical fertilizers to compensate for this degradation. As such, scientists have been on the hunt for new eco-friendly solutions that won't worsen our fight against climate change.\nEnter BSFL. These tiny bugs can consume almost any type of organic waste, from food scraps to agricultural byproducts. But they don't just nibble. Researchers say they devour waste, munching through up to four times their body weight in waste every single day.\nIn comparison, traditional composting often takes up to 10 months or longer to recycle the same amount of waste. That's a pretty big difference. And, combined with other advancements in soil\u2014like the smart soil that can grow crops with less water\u2014frass could be a good opportunity to improve how farmers work their fields.\nBut the real magic happens after the black soldier fly larvae have had their feast. That's because the larvae leave behind something scientists call frass. This nutrient-packed byproduct acts as a natural fertilizer and is brimming with the components plants love and need to survive\u2014like nitrogen, phosphorus, and other beneficial microbes.\nAnd, unlike synthetic fertilizers that degrade soil health over time, frass boosts soil biodiversity and can even improve water retention. Further, because of the various microbes it is packed with, researchers say it could even help crops build natural resistance to pests and diseases.\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has wasted no time in calling on these tiny little waste eaters, either. The agency recently awarded grants to several companies that are pursuing new frontiers in BSFL farming. The model here is relatively simple, too. Local farms supply food waste to feed the larvae; in return, they get frass to enrich their soil.\nDespite its benefits, though, frass isn't widely used yet. Regulatory hurdles remain, and the US National Organic Program isn't willing to fully embrace insect-based fertilizers. Plus, there's the whole thing with public perception\u2014convincing people that bug poop is the next big thing in farming isn't exactly an easy sell despite traditional fertilizers utilizing animal poop for thousands of years.\nBut, as fertilizer costs continue to soar and climate concerns grow, BSFL could offer a low-cost, eco-friendly alternative. Reports say farmers who have tested frass on their crops have reported faster growth, healthier plants, and improved soil. All that's left to do now is topple the market that big fertilizer has spent decades building."

      "text": "New Invention Can Turn Seawater Into Hydrogen Fuel\nScientists have found a way to use electrodes to split seawater and turn it into hydrogen fuel. Normally this would create a corrosive and toxic chlorine gas byproduct. However, with this new method, researchers are able to generate clean fuel using electrolysis, while also removing the need to have pure water to do so cleanly.\nThis new process is being pushed by a California-based startup, Equatic, with support from ARPA-E, and the group plans to sell the hydrogen created by its invention to help offset the cost of the process. But how exactly does Equatic go about making hydrogen fuel without creating those corrosive byproducts?\nTo understand, we need to look at how these systems typically work. Normally, water is turned into hydrogen fuel using an electrolyzer\u2014a machine that relies on stacks of electrodes to separate the water molecules using electricity. However, existing electrolyzers have problems turning seawater into hydrogen fuel because of the corrosive minerals and dissolved salt that are separated from the water.\nThese often cause the machines to stop working, with the internal pieces becoming gummed up or rusted. Because the electrical charge used to separate the salt in the seawater attracts oxygen, it also creates toxic chlorine gas, which corrodes the machine.\nTo solve this problem, though, Equatic's co-founder Xin Chen and his colleagues designed an anode that can selectively split the water molecules from the oxygen without splitting the salt, too. It then pushes the water through a chlorine-blocking layer that stops the salt. This allows the machine to turn seawater into hydrogen fuel without gumming everything up.\nWhat's even more impressive about this new machine is that the researchers believe it should work for at least three years before the anode needs to be removed and recoated. This is, of course, just the latest development we've seen involving saltwater. Researchers have also been looking for ways to turn saltwater into drinking water more efficiently.\nThat's because the ocean is the most abundant source of water on our planet. As such, finding ways to harness that water has become a goal for researchers in various fields."

      "text": "Coffee Actually Helps You Live Longer, Decade-Long Study Says\nThere's good news brewing for coffee lovers\u2014particularly if you enjoy your caffeine fix in the morning. A recent study examining over 40,000 Americans has uncovered compelling evidence that when may be just as important as how much you drink. The findings suggest that the health benefits of morning coffee are much higher than enjoying it at any other time of the day.\nPrevious research has highlighted the health perks of moderate coffee consumption, including reduced risks of Type 2 diabetes, heart attack, and stroke. However, a new study published in the European Heart Journal takes it further by exploring when you drink your daily cup of joe.\nResearchers identified two distinct coffee-drinking patterns: morning drinkers (4 a.m. to noon) and all-day drinkers who sip coffee throughout the day and evening. Based on their findings, morning coffee drinkers reaped the most significant health benefits.\nOver a follow-up period of nearly 10 years, morning coffee drinkers showed a 16 percent lower risk of death from all causes and a 31 percent reduced risk of death from heart disease compared to non-coffee drinkers.\nThey found that the sweet spot was two to three cups of coffee per morning, which corresponded to a 29 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality. Even light drinkers (one cup or less) and heavy coffee drinkers (more than three cups) experienced health benefits from coffee in the mornings, though to a lesser degree.\nBut why exactly does drinking coffee in the morning have such a profound impact? Researchers point to two potential mechanisms. First, consuming coffee later in the day can interfere with melatonin production, disrupting your circadian rhythms and potentially undermining cardiovascular health.\nSecond, coffee's anti-inflammatory properties align well with the body's higher levels of morning inflammation, maximizing its health benefits when enjoyed earlier in the day, like in the morning.\nWhile this study observed correlations rather than direct causation, its implications are still significant. Coffee is already one of the world's most popular beverages, and its health benefits are widely endorsed in dietary guidelines."

When cut, its stem and leaves turn into lignocellulosic biomass, as well as bunch rachis, once they arrive to the packaging plant. At this point, the lignocellulosic biomass is either left on the ground to preserve the soil\u2019s richness, or taken to the open landfills, producing in both cases, greenhouse gases as it decomposes.\nAnother source of waste is rejected fruit that does not meet the standards of commercialisation. This residue can vary between 8 and 20% and is used for animal feed, or it is just rejected because of the economic reasons.\nThe potential solution, suggested by UPM researchers, are two locations for power stations from lignocellulosic biomass production from rejected bananas. This would include the production of 190,102 tonnes of discarded bananas annually and 198,602ha of lignocellulosic biomass which would result in the installed power of two plants could reach 18MW.\nRead more here."

      "text": "Crazy New Machine Can Make Gasoline Out Of Thin Air\nIn 2022, transportation accounted for nearly 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Most of that came from ICE vehicles running on fossil fuels. Despite years of hype and investment, electric vehicles still make up just 8% of cars on U.S. roads.\nFor many drivers, switching to an EV is still too expensive, inconvenient, or unappealing. That's the gap New York-based start-up Aircela is hoping to fill.\nEarlier this month, the company unveiled a working device that produces real, usable gasoline using just air, water, and renewable energy. The system is about the size of a commercial fridge. It captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converts it into fuel by combining the gas with water.\nThe gas it makes can go straight into the tank of a typical car, too. In a live demonstration, Aircela showed off the machine producing fuel on-site, proving that it is possible to make gas out of thin air.\nThe system uses a process called direct air capture, which pulls CO\u2082 from the atmosphere and combines it with water and clean electricity to make gasoline. A spokesperson said the device captures about 10 kilograms of CO\u2082 daily, producing one gallon of gas per day. It can hold up to 17 gallons at once.\nThat's not enough to fuel a car overnight, but it's a solid start. The real promise lies in scale. The machine is small, which means it could be deployed widely in homes, gas stations, or even industrial settings.\nAnd because it uses carbon already in the air, the resulting emissions are essentially neutral. Of course, the system only works as a clean solution if it runs on renewable electricity. And no single device will solve emissions on its own.\nHowever, Aircela's approach might offer something many climate solutions don't: compatibility with the way people already live. Considering the breakthroughs to make lighter, more efficient EVs are still ongoing, finding more climate-friendly ways to produce gasoline could be a huge win.\nIf the company can mass-produce it affordably, this machine that can make gas out of thin air might actually catch on."
