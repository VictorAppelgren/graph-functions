      "feedback": "The draft correctly centers tariffs and enforcement as near-term macro drivers, but it lacks a clear, calendar-driven scenario map, quantified impulse channels, and explicit invalidation triggers suitable for a 3–6 month horizon; to elevate to world-class, rewrite as a tight scenario lattice (base, 1–2 alt paths, and a policy tailwind variant) with dated triggers and path-dependency, tying each to concrete datapoints (DOJ tariff-enforcement actions; Supreme Court oral arguments slated around July 31 with potential rulings timing; CUSMA-origin-certification uptake; UK DCTS validation/Asia Regional Cumulation Group rollout in early 2026; Sri Lanka apparel export and employment metrics) and stating how those would alter margins, pricing power, and flows; quantify the Goodyear proxy where possible (tariff costs cited at about $350 million annualized; Q3 headwind ~ $180 million; ~1,800 layoffs) and map how such cost pass-through and capex/shaping of supply chains would feed equity/credit signals; connect Sri Lanka/UK policy tailwinds (DCTS, 18-country Asia cumulation, 20.4% UK export rise to $67.33m in June 2025; direct employment >350k) to sourcing-diversification dynamics, signaling potential mid-2026 relief but noting earlier procurement shifts; treat the tech-cycle narrative (MacBook M5/M6 rumors and iPhone-processor MAC variants) as an optional secondary signal that could affect electronics supply chains but not core traction unless tariff policy widens, and anchor it with 55GVT420Q; ensure coherence by stating causal chains (tariffs → input-cost pressure → margin/price-pass-through → equity impact) and by identifying invalidation risks (a favorable court ruling or early settlements that compress tariff exposure; or a renewed tariff wave that sustains inflationary pressure); structure the piece to end with a crisp base case, 1–2 clear alts, explicit risks, a watch-list of signals (DOJ actions, court outcomes, CUSMA uptake, UK DCTS progress, Goodyear-margin commentary), and a concise confidence claim; and keep it strictly to IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL, with the cited anchors: (OFY11YO0I)(AJTHKYXQ3)(WLXM1819K)(55GVT420Q).",
