Their presence was easy to verify and they communicated the process and the expectations very clearly. They seamlessly coordinated the trip and eliminated all of my initial doubts and concerns regarding the operation. The doctors were thorough and the technicians were very professional and seemed to take pride in their work. The operation was easy and worry-less because of the overall organization of Smile Hair Clinic. Highly recommended if you decide to go to Turkey \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 for your procedure. My name is Jeff, I am 42, and I live in Florida.\nI got my Hair transplant with Smile Hair Clinic in Istanbul Turkey back in March 2023.I was immediately struck by the professional and welcoming atmosphere. The staff were friendly and reassuring. I\u2019m 6 months post op now and happy with my results so far even though it\u2019s still very early in the process. The post-transplant experience has been fantastic as well. Any messages I\u2019ve had have been answered promptly (thank you Jihane), and they also look for progress photos often. Many thanks to each and everyone of you!\nIt\u2019s been 15 days now. Everything is going good for now. It\u2019s a long process and needs a lot of patience. My name is Gosavi and I\u2019m Australia. It has been a great experience with Smile clinic until now. From the start until now everything is according to the plan. Initial consultation, booking, airport pickup, hotel arrangements was absolutely on point. The pickup and drop pre op and post op was perfect as well. They really take care of you until the end that\u2019s for sure. I wasn\u2019t expecting that great dedicated service from any clinic. The food at hotel is pretty good no space for any complaints. On day 15 now and my case manager is perfectly assisting me every single day for any questions that I have. So far so good. Keen on the further journey. Will keep my comments updated.\nIt was a great experience. They are very helpful before and after the procedure. Great result as well. No regrets.\nReally satisfied with the experience so far! Had my transplant done a week ago, it is healing very well. Very well organised and great communication, at the airport I was greeted by the driver and transported to the hotel. Hotel was clean and cosy, 5 min away from the clinic. I have communicated with the clinic via WhatsApp pre and post op. Staff is very friendly and welcoming, also the clinic is modern and clean. So there's nothing to worry about.\nI recently underwent a FUE hair transplant at Smile Hair Clinic in Istanbul. After a consultation I was given all the information I needed to make an informed decision and there was no pressure to go through with the procedure. The experience was amazing from start to finish and I can\u2019t recommend the clinic and the team highly enough. From the moment I arrived at Istanbul airport, to the moment I left, the Smile Hair Clinic team made me feel comfortable and took care of me. I am now 12 months post-op and I am seeing amazing results. I would also like to make a special mention to the Patient Experience Team. They have been with me every step of the way. They\u2019re just a message or phone call away, and happy to answer any questions. I think this has been really helpful and so important when undergoing this type of procedure. A huge thank you to the team, who I highly recommend! I wouldn\u2019t hesitate in recommending Smile Hair Clinic to anyone considering a hair transplant. In fact, a friend of mine saw my results and booked a hair transplant with Smile Hair Clinic. If you are considering Smile Hair Clinic, look no further and do not hesitate.

Key Stages of a Hair Transplant Istanbul Procedure You have made all the preparations, it is finally the day of your operation and you have arrived at the clinic on time.\nHow much does a hair transplant cost Turkey?\nBetween $1,500 and $4,500 USD\nThe price of a hair transplant in Turkey might differ based on a variety of variables, including the clinic, the experience level of the surgeon, the method employed, and the quantity of grafts needed. But as of March 2025, when I wrote my latest update, hair transplants in Turkey usually cost between $1,500 and $4,500 USD. For more involved operations, certain clinics could provide discounts or bundle offers.\nThere are three key stages to a hair surgery procedure:\n- The Preliminary Stage: This stage covers all the steps from the moment of your arrival to the administration of local anesthesia. Blood Tests: This is the first key step to determine whether or not the patient might have a condition preventing them to go ahead with the procedure. The drawing of the blood should take no longer than a minute, and the results will be out by the time you finish listening to the introductory presentation by our doctors. Introductory Presentation and Graft Quality: This presentation by our doctors is unique to Smile Hair Clinic as it helps to prepare you psychologically for the operation and at the same time informs you about graft quality and its impact on the final results. The information provided helps set realistic expectations by dispelling the false promises and the exaggerated results advertised.\n- The Planning of the Procedure: During this step, you will have your individual consultation with the doctor where he/she will begin by listening to your expectations. The doctor will technically assess whether those expectations can be met, and if necessary, provide alternatives with visual demonstrations. The plan of the procedure will then be finalized taking into consideration both patient input and the doctor\u2019s technical recommendations. The blueprint of the procedure will be drawn onto the scalp and your hair will be shaved in preparation for the local anesthesia. During this stage, you will be asked to wear a patient gown and all your personal belongings will be kept safe in the room cupboard reserved just for you.\n- Local Anesthesia: Hair transplant Istanbul are performed with local anesthesia. The patient is awake throughout the procedure. While you may feel a slight burning for the first few injections, you will feel no pain for the rest of the operation. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes for the local anesthesia to take effect depending on the person.\n- 3.The Hair Transplant Istanbul Procedure: The procedure consists of 3 key phases. Extraction: Until recently grafts were extracted using the Manual Punch FUE Method. Due to technological advancements, this method has given way to the Micromotor FUE Method which allows for a faster and increased extraction of grafts per session. The extracted grafts are then collected using a pen-set and are separated by hair density ready for implantation. The grafts are maintained in a special protective liquid throughout this procedure. The Opening of Canals:The most critical phase of a hair transplant Istanbul procedure is the opening of canals as it will impact the natural look of transplanted hair. The number of extracted hair determines the number of canals to be opened. Local anesthesia is administered this time to the recipient area to prevent pain. Since the gradient and depth of the canal will directly impact the natural look, it is important that it is performed by experienced surgeons. The final result one year from the procedure will be greatly determined by the success of this phase. The vast experience of our doctors at Smile Hair Clinic will guarantee this success. Implantation: The last step is the implantation phase. The length of the phase can differ from patient to patient depending on the number of extracted grafts, the patient\u2019s overall condition, and the level of their bleeding. Once the grafts are implanted carefully the hair transplant Istanbul procedure is completed.\nHow painful is a hair transplant?\nHair transplant Turkey is not a painful procedure. Pain is minimized as painkillers and local anesthesia are applied during hair implant. We do everything we can for the comfort of the patient during the operation. The definitive solution to hair loss treatment is hair surgery.\nIs a hair transplant a good idea?\nDoes hair transplantation work? Yes, definitely! There are some factors that should be considered during hair transplant Istanbul. The transplanted hair starts to grow after approximately 6 months.\nDHI Hair Transplant Turkey Cost\nOne of Turkey\u2019s popular hair transplant techniques is Direct Hair Implantation (DHI), which has become known for its innovative procedures with natural and dense outcomes. DHI involves implanting hair follicles directly into the scalp without having to prepare any channels (micro incisions) beforehand. Grafts are implanted after extraction via a special tool called a choi pen. It is believed to be a more delicate and less aggressive procedure.\nHow Much Does DHI Hair Transplant Cost in Turkey\nTurkey is one of the top locations for hair transplants, and therefore, it showcases some of the very best surgeons. The average price for direct hair implantation in Turkey is from $1250 to $5000, and it can vary, depending on how experienced the surgeon is and the reputation of the clinic.\nIs Hair Transplant Charged Per Graft?\nWhile the most prevalent pricing method around the world, is not very common at hair clinics across Turkey. Instead, hair transplant Turkey procedures are priced per operation usually as part of an all-inclusive package. The prices for these package deals depend on the details of the deal as well as the price quality ratio of each clinic. The most ideal solution for a prospective patient is to do plenty of market of research to compare the exact details and the quality of the service provided. Patients should approach with caution if a given offer is comparatively much lower or much higher than the average price of a package deal on offer.\nThings to Consider After Hair Transplantation\nHair transplant Turkey Your hair transplant procedure is successfully complete. Now it is time to go over the points to watch out for following the procedure. It will take about 12 to 18 months for the transplanted hair to adjust to their new home and to fully grow back. The first 3 months will require some patience as the transplanted hair will gradually fall off. Some responsibility falls upon the patient during this phase. The final appearance is as much the result of a successful procedure as it is the success of the post-operative care taken by the patient. Reducing the amount you smoke, eating a healthy diet, avoiding the use of commercial shampoos, and the taking of vitamin complexes and products that nourish your hair will together help with the recovery and successful growth of your new hair. It is important to note that cases where the patient ends up dissatisfied with the final result are often the cases where the patient has failed to provide adequate post-operative care following a successful hair transplant. As with all aesthetic procedures, post-operative care is key to achieving the best possible results. Smile Hair Clinic provides its patients with all the necessary information immediately after the hair transplant Turkey procedure and will continue to monitor and support you throughout this process. We also provide a post-operative kit which includes a handbook with more detailed information about post-operative care.\nHow long do hair transplants last?\nBetween 120 days and 150 days after the hair implant operation, new hair begins to grow and continues to grow at a normal rate. About 6 months after the hair surgery session, the transplanted hair starts to grow and continues. The transplanted hair does not fall out and continues to grow for a lifetime.\nWhat is the success rate of hair transplant?\nHospital and clinical studies show that 85-95% of the transplanted hair grows easily in the area. A high rate indicates that hair transplant Turkey is generally successful. Patients think that the newly transplanted hair will be rejected on the scalp and are afraid, but this is not the case.\nDo Hair Transplant Last Forever?\nMicrotransplants leave virtually no scars. They also preserve much of the hair that will be needed for future transplants. The coverage achieved depends on the extent of your hair loss, the density of your donor hair and the number of treatments. Much of the transplanted hair will fall out within a month. About three months later (90 to 100 days), new hair begins to grow and continues to grow at a normal rate. About six months after a hair transplant, the transplanted hair begins to take on a natural appearance and will continue to grow for life. The donor area from which the hair is extracted shrinks to a small, barely noticeable incision line that is completely hidden by the surrounding hair.\nWhy is Turkey so cheap for hair transplant?\nTurkey is known for performing hair transplants at a fraction of the cost of other countries. And many people ask why hair transplant Istanbul are so cheap in Turkey. The affordable prices do not mean that the clinics are offering you inferior treatments. Turkey\u2019s costs are lower than other countries, which is why the prices are lower. Turkey\u2019s affordable labour costs give the clinics a big advantage over European competitors in determining the cost of hair transplant Turkey procedures. One of the biggest costs for any business is the physical location in which it operates. There are more than 1,200 hospitals in Turkey. The weakened Turkish lira and continued foreign exchange earnings have helped many clinics to obtain good in-hospital rates, which is reflected in their cost structure to the great benefit of patients.\nHow long do hair transplant last Turkey\nA hair transplant Turkey is a good way to achieve natural looking results. Although this procedure is designed to restore hair, the results will depend on the surgeon you choose. This is why it is important to consult a doctor who is experienced and understands hair loss. The condition of your hair will also affect the results.

Unfortunately, this process is permanent and you will not be able to go back to the way you were.\nDoes Low Cost Means Low Quality?\nLow hair transplantat Istanbul cost may cause some to hesitate and think low price also means low quality.\nThe reason why hair transplant Turkey cost and other treatments are so affordable is the balance between Turkish currency and GBP, EURO, and USD. Currency balance is the main reason you may have a top quality hair transplant and other treatments in a very experienced clinic or hospital.\nIn the past two decades, Turkish surgeons number working in the hair transplant field has been grown significantly\u2014this increased competition.
