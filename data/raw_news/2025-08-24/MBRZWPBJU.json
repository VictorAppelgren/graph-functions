  "content": "There\u2019s an old European proverb that says \u201cNo man is a hero to his valet.\u201d That\u2019s what pops into one\u2019s head when you consider a new book by King Charles\u2019s longtime butler. With kind-yet-revealing accounts of the Royals during the turbulent years of 2004 to 2011, butler-turned-etiquette expert Grant Harrold's book is a must-read for Brit Royal Family buffs. Ahead of its pub date, the author talks about Kate Middleton and makes predictions on the future of the Charles-William-Harry rift.\n\nHarrold, author of The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life of Royal Service, recently told the Mirror. that he immediately approved of Kate Middleton, who he met when she began dating Prince William. \u201cThat girl was a Queen-in-waiting in every aspect. She is the perfect Queen material and you can so obviously see that. Everything about her\u2014the way she carried herself, the way she spoke, the way she interacted with people, her kindness, her beauty\u2014she was, if I can say, the modern-day Princess Diana,\u201d Harrold said.\n\nAlong with praise for Kate, Harrold has happy memories of princes William and Harry. \u201cWilliam and Harry were so close, as brothers go. With many siblings, you can be close as children and then maybe drift a bit as you grow up in your late teens and early 20s, but William and Harry were the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it's because of their mother\u2019s death, but they were inseparable. They were hanging out together, going to pubs together, just having fun together.\u201d Reading this, you can\u2019t help but think back to candid shots from 2007 of Harry, William and Kate cheering on the English team during the RBS Six Nations Championship match between England and Italy.\n\nSuch happy memories of the family come in sharp contrast to the upcoming third anniversary of the last time the two brothers and their spouses were photographed together, outside Windsor Castle in September 2022 honoring the late Queen Elizabeth. \u201cIf I had been told all those years ago that they were going to fall out, I would\u2019ve bet \u00a3100 that it would never happen,\" Harrold said. \"Even when the rumours (of a rift) first started, I was saying publicly to the press that they would never fall out, that\u2019s how sure I was.\n\n\u201cAnd when all the conflict really started, I was asking myself \u2018Why has this all gone so badly wrong?\u2019 I couldn\u2018t wrap my head around it. Now they\u2019re not even speaking to each other, and they used to speak all the time. It\u2019s really sad,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite their public estrangement, Harrold believes that a reconciliation between the princes may happen\u2014but in private. He said: \u201cI think families fall out and families can heal, but it\u2019s never the same. So yes I can see a reconciliation, I can see Harry coming back.\n\n\"I don\u2019t see Harry and Meghan ever on the Palace balcony for Trooping the Colour for example, but I can see the family patching things up behind closed doors and working towards the King seeing his grandchildren [Archie and Lilibet]. I think that's what they're trying to work towards,\" he said. \"I think they could be thinking \u2018Let's just be a family behind closed doors and move on from this rift from our point of view, not from the public\u2019s point of view.\"\n\nRoyals devotees will want to pre-order this book, available September 23, to savor all the royal tea, served piping hot.\n\nPrince William Breaks His Silence with Personally Signed Note\u2014and I Really Should\u2019ve Seen It Coming",

      "text": "'I knew Prince William, Kate and Harry - we have to accept brutal truth about rift'\nKing Charles' former butler has lifted the lid on what goes on behind closed Palace doors, unveiling his first impressions on a young Kate Middleton and sharing the brutal truth about William and Harry's rift\nEffortlessly beautiful, her natural elegance matched only by her obvious intelligence, Kate Middleton was just 22, but royal butler Grant Harold knew she was a \u201cqueen in waiting.\u201d\nOne of King Charles \u2019 trusted butlers for seven years - spent mainly at Highgrove - he is uniquely placed to reveal what really goes on behind the palace gates.\nHe tells The Mirror : \u201cThat girl was a Queen in waiting in every aspect. She is the perfect Queen material and you can so obviously see that. Everything about her - the way she carried herself, the way she spoke, the way she interacted with people, her kindness, her beauty - she was, if I can say, the modern day Princess Diana.\u201d\nIn his new book The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life of Royal Service , Grant - who worked with the royals between 2004 and 2011 - mainly as a butler for King Charles, but occasionally seconded to work for Queen Elizabeth - first met Kate during the early years of her romance with Prince William.\nComparing her humour to that of Princess Di, he continues: \u201cDiana used to do things at Sandringham to make the staff laugh by poking her head out the window and pulling faces, and Kate was doing the same kind of thing. She is everything you can imagine, she is a beautiful and intelligent woman.\u201d\nGrant, a Scot, had wanted to work for the royal family ever since a childhood dream, in which he was dancing with Queen Elizabeth and spent most of his time with them in Highgrove, the stunning Gloucestershire palace that King Charles shared with William and Harry.\nContrasting his reception from Kate and William, who he says \"took a while\" to trust him, he recalls how Prince Harry greeted him for the first time with a water balloon fight.\nRecalling how tight knit the princes were back then, he says: \u201cWilliam and Harry were so close, as brothers go. With many siblings, you can be close as children and then maybe drift a bit as you grow up in your late teens and early 20s, but William and Harry were the opposite.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it's because of their mother\u2019s death, but they were inseparable. They were hanging out together, going to pubs together, just having fun together.\n\u201cIf I had been told all those years ago that they were going to fall out, I would\u2019ve bet \u00a3100 that it would never happen. Even when the rumours (of a rift) first started, I was saying publicly to the press that they would never fall out, that\u2019s how sure I was.\n\u201cAnd when all the conflict really started, I was asking myself \u2018Why has this all gone so badly wrong?\u2019 I couldn\u2018t wrap my head around it. Now they\u2019re not even speaking to each other, and they used to speak all the time. It\u2019s really sad.\u201d\nGrant also believes that any reconciliation between the princes may happen away from the spotlight. He says: \u201cI think families fall out and families can heal, but it\u2019s never the same. So yes I can see a reconciliation, I can see Harry coming back, but not in the Firm as it used to be.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Harry and Meghan ever on the Palace balcony for Trooping the Colour for example, but I can see the family patching things up behind closed doors and working towards the King seeing his grandchildren [Archie and Lilibet]. I think that's what they're trying to work towards. I think they could be thinking \u2018Let's just be a family behind closed doors and move on from this rift from our point of view, not from the public\u2019s point of view\u2019.\u201d\nDespite hoping for a reunion between the Sussexes and the wider Windsor family, Grant went on to say that \u201cthings are such a mess right now\u201d, and admitted: \u201cI think we have to accept that there is a real possibility that we may never see them as a united family in public.\u201d\nBut he reveals King Charles to be an exceptionally compassionate man and believes he may be the orchestrator of any reconciliation in the future, saying: \u201cThe thing that surprised me was how genuine and nice he was.\u201d\nHe recalls how he would be in the middle of serving dinner, saying: \u201cI would hear \u2018Oh and how are you today?\u2019 and I\u2019d ignored him (King Charles) because I thought he was talking to the guests.\n\u201cThen he\u2019d say my name and ask me again, and then he\u2019d start saying \u2018How\u2019s your mum? How\u2019s your papa? How\u2019s your brother? How\u2019s your home?\u2019\n\u201cIf I was having something done, he\u2019d always know and remember what was going on. He\u2019d say \u2018Did that thing get done in your house?\u2019 His kindness and compassion would catch me off guard every single time.\u201d\nCertain that Harry will have kept up some kind of communication with his father, in light of his illness, Grant continues: \u201cCharles is a very compassionate man. So, even if William - as the big brother - is angry at what Harry has done and maybe has more reservations about meeting up with Harry, I think the King, at this point in his life, will be thinking \u2018Let\u2019s look at the bigger picture. Life\u2019s too short, and family is all you\u2019ve got\u2019.\u201d\nHe also believes Harry will want to heal the rift with the king. He says: \u201cI think Harry does want to reunite with his father, because at the end of the day, Harry is aware that his father has not been a very well man, because they were very close and that doesn\u2019t always change.\u201d\nClearly a big fan of the King, Grant recalls a touching moment when he introduced him to the late Queen at a banquet at Kew palace.\nLaughing, he says: \u201cI\u2019ll never forget, I was so focused on the job, and so overwhelmed and excited to be on her service and I was thinking, \u2018Don\u2019t do anything wrong, Grant. Don\u2019t put down the wrong plate, don't drop the sauce, don't overfill the glass,\u2019 all these things.\n\u201cI remember going over to offer the Queen the vegetables and suddenly Charles looks around at the Queen and over to me and says \u2018Oh Mummy this is Grant, my newest butler\u2019. And I'm thinking \u2018Oh god not now, not over the vegetables!\u2019\u201d\nIn light of the news that William and Kate, along with their three children George, Charlotte and Louis, are set to relocate to Forest Lodge on the Windsor estate, from their current home Adelaide Cottage, Grant shares his thoughts on the fate of Buckingham Palace.\n\u201cWhen it comes to William, he is used to smaller houses like Highgrove, because he didn\u2019t grow up in the huge palaces or castles,\u201d says Grant. \u201cSo I think there\u2019ll be a transition where Windsor becomes the hub of the monarchy.\n\u201cAs Forest Lodge is on the Windsor estate, that whole area will become the royal HQ. And then Buckingham Palace could just be open year round as a tourist hotspot, while also operating as the royal office, because it is such a landmark of the royal institution.\n\u201cSo, I think Windsor will become the embodiment of the Firm as William and Kate move into their forever home. Living in Forest Lodge will be a lot cheaper than living in Buckingham Palace. Also, William has long championed homelessness causes, and it's a bit hard to support the homeless when you\u2019re living in your massive castle, so I think he\u2019s aware of that.\nGrant Harrold\u2019s book The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life of Royal Service is available from August 28th."

But way before she took on the title of Duchess of Cambridge (and now Princess of Wales), Kate Middleton\u2019s life was quite different.\nThe London native led a normal life as part of an upper-middle-class family, studying psychology and art history as she developed a passion for charity work. The royal even demonstrated a natural talent for sports, breaking a record at St. Andrew's School's track and field event (which, FYI, still stands today). But the princess's life took a turn after she met her future husband, Prince William.\nWhile discussing her thoughts on joining the royal family in 2010, shortly after her engagement, she candidly told British journalist Tom Bradby, \u201cIt\u2019s quite a daunting prospect but hopefully I\u2019ll take it in my stride. William\u2019s a great teacher, so hopefully he\u2019ll be able to help me along the way, and I really look forward to spending my time with William.\u201d\nMore than a decade later, the proud mom and future Queen Consort is radiating confidence as she successfully juggles multiple royal engagements\u2014and captures stunning portraits while she's at it.\nKeep reading for the latest on Princess Catherine.\nFast Facts\n- Official Royal Title: Catherine, Princess of Wales\n- Hometown: Reading, Berkshire, England\n- Birthday: January 9, 1982\n- Spouse: William, Prince of Wales\n- Children: Prince George of Wales, Princess Charlotte of Wales, Prince Louis of Wales\n- Star Sign: Capricorn\nEarly Life\nCatherine Elizabeth Middleton was born to Michael and Carole Middleton in 1982 at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading. The princess is the eldest of three, including Philippa (\"Pippa\") and James, and when she was just 2 years old, she and her family moved to Amman in Jordan, where she attended nursery school. Then, in 1986, the family returned to West Berkshire, where Middleton attended St. Andrew\u2019s School.\nHer Royal Highness has opened up about enjoying her childhood, thanks to her supportive family. When she appeared on Giovanna Fletcher's podcast, Happy Mum, Happy Baby, she said, \"I had a very happy childhood. It was great fun and I'm very lucky I come from a very strong family. My parents were hugely dedicated. I really appreciate now as a parent how much they sacrificed for us. They came to every sports match, they'd be the ones on the sideline shouting, and we'd always have our family holidays together.\""

And now, the ruling monarch of the United Kingdom is devoting much of his time to filling his late mother's shoes.\nThe proud father of two made history in September 2022 as the oldest royal to ascend to the throne at 73 years old, and he has since made several headlines while carrying out his royal duties, whether he's traveling abroad for a historical tour or participating in events to support special causes. Still, his most admirable trait has been his unwavering commitment to furthering environmental causes.\nIn his first speech as monarch, King Charles referenced his long-standing passion for the environment, saying, \"My life will, of course, change as I take up my new responsibilities. It will no longer be possible for me to give so much of my time and energies to the charities and issues for which I care so deeply. But I know this important work will go on in the trusted hands of others.\"\nDespite recent health setbacks and a brief hiatus, the king has remained devoted to serving his country, demonstrating his incredible leadership.

According to royal biographer Philip Eade, his parents were often separated from the former prince due to their many royal duties. His father, however, took every opportunity to help raise his son while the queen was away\u2014and Charles reportedly wasn't a fan of his strict parenting style.\nIn Time, Eade writes, \"Prince Philip\u2019s determination that his timid son should learn to stand on his own feet stemmed from the turbulent circumstances of his own childhood\u2026Having developed a hard-nosed approach to life...Prince Philip saw it as his responsibility to toughen up his son and prepare him for the rigours of one day becoming king.\""

      "text": "Prince William Breaks His Silence with Personally Signed Note\u2014and I Really Should\u2019ve Seen It Coming\nPrince William takes his family time seriously, so the royal\u2019s lack of personal and social media appearances are to be expected. However, he just broke his silence with a personal note out of the blue\u2014but one I should have seen coming. That's because Princess Kate beat him to the punch. See, Wills and Kate are each patrons of separate\u2014and sometimes opposing\u2014women\u2019s rugby teams, and those teams apparently need well wishes during this season of intense competition. (And though Kate\u2019s note may have been first, I think William\u2019s is the message that really shows extra effort...more on that below.)\nInstragram/@princeandprincessofwales\nWilliam posted images of three players with the following note, signed with his personal \u201cW\u201d: \u201c\"Good luck to Wales Women as they kick off their Rugby World Cup campaign against Scotland today!\u201d in both Welsh and English. And then, as a special touch, he wrote a phrase only in Welsh that can be translated as \u201cGood Luck Wales, go for it!\" People reported earlier this year that William is learning conversational Welsh; that tracks, as he\u2019s been frequently posting Welsh language messages.\nOverall, heartfelt sports fandom is a big thing at Kensington palace, what with William mugging at soccer matches. So it\u2019s no surprise that the day before Will\u2019s note, Kate posted a note cheering on her team, the Red Roses. (That\u2019s the team she began championing after Prince Harry stepped back from royal duties in 2020.) Kate\u2019s team represents England and triumphed over Team USA in a thrashing victory: final score 69 to 7). Well done Kate, and Red Roses.\nNot so happily, despite his multilingual shout-out, William\u2019s Welsh team was overcome, losing to Scotland by 30 points (Wales head coach Sean Lynn told BBC One: \"I've just said to the players that's just not good enough. We said we wanted to be physical and Scotland, credit to them, bullied us off the park.\u201d) The World Cup womens\u2019 games are not over, however, so there are a few more matches for the women from Wales to redeem themselves.\nAlastair Grant-WPA Pool/Getty Images\nAs for the rivalry that might be happening at chez Windsor, now that William\u2019s team has lost and Kate\u2019s has won? I\u2019m thinking the royals will keep to friendly ribbing, since the two are committed to cross-country sports patronage. For example, in March they were photographed seated together meeting with injured players at the Guinness Six Nations 2025 match between Wales and England. And just in case anyone\u2019s keeping track, in that men\u2019s rugby match, England handily defeated Wales 68 to 14. Don\u2019t give up, Wales\u2014and Prince William, we look forward to more Welsh language posts to spur your teams to victory.\nPrince William Gets Candid in Emotional New Statement About Grief"
