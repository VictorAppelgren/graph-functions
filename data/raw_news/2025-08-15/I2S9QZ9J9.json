  "content": "After spending more than a half century at the bottom of the Long Island Sound, a long lost college ring has been reunited with its owner.\n\nIt's thanks to Port Jefferson resident Dave Orlowski, who uses a metal detector to hunt for history and treasures. He's unearthed dozens of jewels, but their owners can be unknowable.\n\n\"I don't do it for money. I do it for the thrill,\" Orlowski said. \"You never know what you're going to pull out.\"\n\nWeeks ago, at Cedar Beach in Mount Sinai, Orlowski pulled out a priceless treasure, complete an ID.\n\n\"It said Alfred DiStefano, class of 1969, Fordham University,\" Orlowski said.\n\nThat started another hunt. Orlowski contacted Karen Manning, the Facebook page administrator for the Fordham Class of '69.\n\n\"Al sent me a message, and I said did you lose your ring, your Fordham ring, and he said yes, a long time ago,\" Manning explained.\n\nFifty six years ago, to be precise.\n\nThe ring was shipped to Alfred DiStefano in Texas, where the retired doctor had his postman record the reunion.\n\n\"This is a miracle. I couldn't describe it any other way,\" he said.\n\nHe recalled watching the sunset on a pier near Cedar Beach in 1969.\n\n\"I remember it like it was yesterday. I remember watching it slip off my finger into the water, and it was deep,\" he said. \"I said, it's gone.\"\n\nDiStefano said the gold palladium ring held up remarkably well after spending 56 years in the Long Island Sound.\n\n\"It's great. I haven't taken it off since I got it. I figured if I make it another 56 years, it will be on my finger. They can bury me in it,\" he said.\n\nThe ring, worth about $100 in 1969, could now have been sold for more than $3,000. Orlowski credits his wife for helping him decide it was worth far more than its weight in gold.\n\n\"She said if it were your ring, you would want it returned, and I said question answered, right there,\" Orlowski said.\n\n\"I think a lot of people would not go out of their way, the extra mile. He did, and I really appreciate it,\" DiStsfano said.\n\n\"He's very happy. It makes me happy that it made him happy,\" Orlowski said.\n\nThe ring was buried more than a foot deep. With the help of good hearts, it found its way home.",
