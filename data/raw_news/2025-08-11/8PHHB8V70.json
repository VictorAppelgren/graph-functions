  "content": "A North Carolina stock car driver died on Saturday night after suffering a medical emergency, and his car struck a wall head-on during a race at Bowman Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem.\n\nRobbie Brewer had been a veteran stock car driver and had been taking part in a Sportsman Division race when the incident happened.\n\nThe 54-year-old driver had been coming around turn three when he didn\u2019t make turn four and hit the wall straight-on, according to the Winston-Salem Journal.\n\nThe car came to a stop near the start-finish line, as the chief flagman, Randy Smith, was the first out to the crash. The track\u2019s crew had to peel the roof off the car to extract Brewer, the report stated.\n\nRace officials did not say what the medical emergency had been.\n\nCourtney Marquette, Brewer\u2019s daughter, mourned the loss of her father in a post on social media, confirming his death.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t just lose my dad, many people just lost a best friend, mentor, talking buddy or someone they could have a good time with,\u201d she wrote.\n\nTrack officials described Brewer as a \u201ctalented and passionate racer, and highly respected competitor among his peers\u201d in a statement.\n\nHe had been taking part in a 20-lap race on Saturday night and it was believed to be the first time since 2002 that a driver had died at the track, the Winston-Salem Journal reported.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere in the stands was a mixture of how you feel coming up on a terrible crash on the interstate and being in church,\u201d said race fan Tom Radulovic, who was in the stands when the crash occurred. \u201cThere was silence and reverence with some folks clearly praying.\u201d\n\nTrack historian Justin Mincey said Brewer made nearly 260 career starts on the Sportsman Division and recorded his best season in 2011 when he won the points championship.",

      "text": "Driver Robbie Brewer, a fixture at Bowman Gray Stadium for several years, has died.\nBrewer, 54, suffered a medical emergency while in his car driving in a Sportsman Division race on Saturday night at the historic track.\nCourtney Marquette, who is Brewer\u2019s daughter, confirmed the death on social media.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t just lose my dad, many people just lost a best friend, mentor, talking buddy or someone they could have a good time with,\u201d she wrote.\nAs Brewer was coming around turn three, he failed to make turn four and headed straight into the wall.\nRandy Smith, the chief flagman, was the first to reach Brewer\u2019s car after it had come to a stop near the start-finish line. Track supervisor Jimmy Brown and his crew then peeled the roof off and extracted Brewer from the car. He was taken to Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Hospital by ambulance.\nPeople are also reading\u2026\n\u201cWe are saddened by the passing of Robbie Brewer after he was transported to an area medical facility following an on-track medical incident during last night\u2019s event at Bowman Gray Stadium,\u201d track officials said in a statement. \u201cRobbie was a talented and passionate racer, and highly respected competitor among his peers. Our thoughts and prayers are with Robbie\u2019s family and friends at this time.\u201d\nBrewer made nearly 260 starts in his career in the Sportsman Division, according to track historian Justin Mincey. In 2011, he had his best season winning the points championship. In 2006, he was second in the rookie of the year voting in that division to Kenny Bost.\nHe was a consistent driver finishing in the top 10 in points in 10 of his 13 seasons. He had 11 wins overall, which placed him 36th all-time and he had 76 top five finishes.\nBrewer also made 28 starts in the Stadium Stock Division and made his first career start in June 1990.\nBrewer also raced at other tracks. In 2018 and 2019, he was the Caraway Speedway champion in the 602 Modified Division, according to Mincey. He had six featured wins in 2019 and over a span of those two seasons won 12 times at Caraway.\nSmith, who has been working at the stadium for 16 years, said Robbie had no enemies.\n\u201cHe was loved by everyone,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is one person that can say anything bad about Robbie. He was a great guy.\u201d\nFellow driver Brad Lewis, whose race shop is about two minutes from where Brewer lived, said he\u2019s heartbroken at the loss.\n\u201cHe was like a big brother to me even though we were not that far apart in age,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI\u2019m bet everybody in that pit area has a Robbie story and that\u2019s a testament to what he meant to that place and to all of us who compete over there.\u201d\nLewis said there\u2019s been countless times where Brewer helped him with a part or advice.\n\u201cHe answered the phone one night at midnight and I needed torque wrench, and about three minutes after I hung up, he was over at our shop helping us,\u201d Lewis said.\nLewis said it\u2019s going to be hard to race this coming weekend but he\u2019s going to honor his friend the best that he can.\n\u201cHe was a wheelman through and through,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI\u2019m not only going to honor him the rest of the season but for as long as we race out there. He\u2019ll be missed.\u201d\nFans in the stands\nAmong the 12,000 or so fans at the Stadium on Saturday night was Tom Radulovic of Winston-Salem.\nRadulovic, who is an occasional fan on Saturday nights, went with friend Rick Layton.\n\u201cThe atmosphere in the stands was a mixture of how you feel coming up on a terrible crash on the interstate and being in church,\u201d Radulovic said. \u201cThere was silence and reverence with some folks clearly praying.\u201d\nThere is no bad seat in the house at the quarter mile track and Radulovic had a good view of the crash.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I had a very direct line of sight into Brewer\u2019s vehicle,\u201d Radulovic said. \u201cWhen they put him on the stretcher, I was able to see his hands, looking for that little wave athletes often give. There was no movement. My heart sank.\u201d\nIt\u2019s believed to be the first death at the track during a race since 2002 when Bubba Beck died while racing. In 1958, Billy Myers had a heart attack while racing and also died.\nBack in 1937 and 1950 two drivers also died during competition."

That was pretty intense and emotional.\u201d\nPawol worked first base during the first game of Saturday\u2019s doubleheader and third base for the second game.\n\u201cShe did a good job,\u201d Braves manager Brian Snitker said Saturday. \u201cYou can tell she knows what she does.\u201d\nPawol is a rover called up from the minors, so her next MLB assignment is unclear."

In this and in all my lives,\u201d Rodriguez, 31, wrote in Spanish, including a snapshot of her oval-shaped diamond engagement ring.\nThe couple first stepped out together at Best FIFA Football Awards in Zurich in January 2017, and later made things Instagram official in May of that year.\nRonaldo and Rodriguez share five children: 8-year-old twins Eva Maria and Mateo, daughters Alana, 7, and Bella, 3, and his 15-year-old son Cristiano Jr., from a previous relationship.\nThey announced the death of Bella\u2019s newborn twin brother, \u00c1ngel, in April 2022.\nAlthough Rodriguez has been spotted with a ring on her ring finger, this is the first time she shared engagement news.\nThe couple discussed taking the next step in their relationship in the Netflix docuseries, \u201cI Am Georgina\u201d \u2014 an emotional in-depth portrait of the influencer\u2019s daily life.\n\u201cThey\u2019re always joking about the wedding, \u2018When is the wedding?'\u201d Rodriguez said of her friends in the March 2025 episode. \u201cSince Jennifer Lopez\u2019s song \u201cThe Ring Or When\u201d came out, they started singing it to me.

I\u2019m 1,000 percent sure that it\u2019ll happen.\u201d\nThe couple\u2019s engagement comes more than three years after a federal civil case accusing Ronaldo of raping a 25-year-old woman in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009 was dismissed.\nKathryn Mayorga, a former school teacher, claimed Ronaldo, who was 24 at the time, raped her at the Palms Place in 2009. The allegations were first reported in 2017 by German magazine Der Spiegel.\nUS District Judge Jennifer Dorsey dismissed the case with prejudice, due to misconduct by Mayorga\u2019s attorney, Leslie Mark Stovall, who used \u201cpurloined\u201d confidential documents.\nStovall was ordered to pay a proportion of Ronaldo\u2019s legal costs."
