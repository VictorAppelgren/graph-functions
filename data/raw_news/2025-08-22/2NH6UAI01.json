  "description": "The Yellowhead Pipeline Project, spanning over 230 kilometers (142.92 miles) from the Peers area to Fort Saskatchewan in Alberta with an estimated investment of C$2.8 billion ($2.01 billion), is expected to deliver more than 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.  The needs-assessment application is the first of two key regulatory filings that require approval from the Alberta Utilities Commission to advance the project.  ATCO expects to file a separate application later this year to seek approval for construction of the infrastructure, set to start in 2026, and to begin operations.",
