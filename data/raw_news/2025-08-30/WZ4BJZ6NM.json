  "description": "A feud over management of one of North America's longest rivers has been simmering in the courts for years. It reached a boil when the U.S. Supreme Court sent western states and the federal government...",
  "content": "Brian Richter, the group's president, said that over the last couple of decades, New Mexico has lost more than 70% of its reservoir storage along the river while groundwater has been extracted faster than it can be replenished. Add to that New Mexico has fallen behind in its water deliveries to Texas.\n\nMany details \u2014 and the price tag \u2014 have yet to be worked out, the general counsel for the New Mexico state engineer's office told state lawmakers this month. The Legislature in 2023 set aside $65 million toward the settlements and related infrastructure projects, and the state is tapping additional federal dollars. But it will still need more funds, experts say.\n\nBen Etcheverry, a board member of the New Mexico Chile Association, said farmers have transitioned to drip irrigation to save water and energy but are continually told they have to do more with even less water and pay higher rates.\n\n\u201cIt just becomes a game of whack-a-mole while we try to do better,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time we do better, it seems they turn it into a punishment.\u201d",
