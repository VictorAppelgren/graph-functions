  "title": "My Blink Outdoor Camera Ran for Over a Year Without a Recharge. It\u2019s Still One of My Smartest Buys",
  "description": "I've tested dozens of security cameras over the years.",
  "content": "The Blink Outdoor 4 security camera typically costs around $100. Right now, you can get a two-pack for $180, which is still a solid value for a wireless setup that doesn\u2019t require constant recharging.\n\u2022 The Blink's Outdoor 4 security camera comes with lithium AA batteries that lasted me well over a year, unlike competitor cameras that need frequent recharging as often as every month.\n\u2022 The Blink Outdoor 4 is one of the more affordable cams, at about $100, and it can often be found on sale.\n\u2022 The Blink app is limited to Alexa support only, meaning you cannot connect with Google, Apple or other third-party smart platforms.\n\nBlink's Outdoor 4 cam came with a big promise when I first started reviewing it: Lithium AA batteries that could last for two years without needing to be replaced. That's a ridiculously long time for a wireless security camera, which usually have batteries that need recharging every few months. I started out skeptical, but Blink's cam stayed operational on my fence, not just for a few months but season after season while I waited, increasingly impressed.\n\nWhile my Blink Outdoor 4 model didn't quite reach the full two years that Blink rates its wireless camera batteries at, a year and a half far surpasses any wireless camera with a rechargeable battery like Ring or Nest use. In my experience, those rechargeable batteries tend to last several months at the most before you need to bring them in for a recharge or switch them out with a new battery pack.\n\nThat recharging gets annoying during cold winters or for wireless cameras that are posted out of reach and require a ladder to switch batteries out. And if your cams activate all the time, batteries run out even faster. I don't mind leaning out to grab the video doorbell for a quick recharge, but for other outdoor cameras it turns into an unwanted -- and random -- task.\n\nBlink, meanwhile, promises long-lasting batteries that you replace, not recharge, when the time comes. Those new batteries cost $4 to $5, which works out to about 22 cents a month for the convenience of not bothering about it. I've found that to be a particularly helpful option for an outdoor camera I can set up and leave to do its job -- giving me one less thing to worry about.\n\nMy experience with the Blink Outdoor 4\n\nI think of the Blink Outdoor 4 as a \"jack of all trades\" outdoor camera, which is why it has earned a spot on my list of the best home security cameras as the best camera for battery life. I often find myself recommending it for someone who wants an all-purpose camera at a fairly affordable price of $100. And right now you can get a two-pack of the cameras for $180.\n\nFrom the 1080p resolution and Alexa support to the two-way audio and motion detection, the Outdoor 4 does a little of everything in a compact, weather-resistant design. But where it really shines is that extended battery life.\n\nThe Blink Outdoor 4 runs on two lithium AA batteries slotted into the back (included). Unscrew the back cover and you can have new batteries in and out in a minute -- I just did this part after a year and a half of use and the hardest part was remembering how to detach the Outdoor 4 from its mount without breaking it.\n\nUnlike some batteries with \"lithium\" in the name, these aren't rechargeable. They offer other benefits instead, including extra power compared to traditional AA batteries and an elongated shelf life of up to 25 years, so you can buy a pack without worrying about them dying. While more expensive than standard AAs, it's still relatively low cost: I can find a pack of 24 lithium AAs for $46, which works out to about $2 per battery or $4 to replace the Blink's batteries every year or two -- not a bad price for convenience.\n\nIf one to two years of battery life just isn't enough, you can also purchase a Blink extension pack ($30) to add more batteries so the cam can last even longer, a possibility if you want to put it in an out-of-the-way spot.\n\nThe Blink Outdoor 4 uses a small screw-in mount. I can't screw anything into my impervious fiber cement siding, but a fence post proved the ideal option for watching my backyard and various wildlife appearances.\n\nThe mount is a little stiff and requires careful adjustment when angling but is otherwise problem-free. With an operating temperature range of -4 to 113 degrees Fahrenheit, I watched my Blink Outdoor 4 brave blistering summers and winter snowstorms without complaint, the batteries inside still powering through.\n\nI've tinkered with dozens of home security apps and Blink remains one of my favorites. The Blink app has a welcome combination of simplicity and easily accessible camera features. A few taps can get you almost anywhere you need to go, including quick camera live views and two-way audio chats.\n\nThe app also lets you check on battery life so you can see when it's \"OK\" or reaching danger levels -- until, as I found out, it dies completely, in which case you won't be able to check on battery life.\n\nBlink's app serves up motion and human detection alerts according to your settings. It also enables the connection to the included Sync Module 2, which has a USB slot you can use for video clip storage, making the Blink subscription services ($3 per month) entirely optional.\n\nI can't talk about battery life without mentioning solar panels. Many are available for the Blink Outdoor 4, and if you have the space, you could add one. Some work better than others and the best, like this $43 model, have their own built-in battery to power the Blink because those lithium AA batteries can't be recharged.\n\nWith extra-long battery life, a solar panel is less necessary, but this is an option if you are putting your Blink camera in a sunny spot and never really want to worry about battery life at all. I haven't tested solar panels with the Blink Outdoor 4, but I have tested them with many other security cams and I can say they do keep batteries topped off, particularly in the summer months.\n\nThe specs for the Blink Outdoor 4\n\u2022 Size: 2.76 in W x 2.76 in L x 1.61 in D (70 mm W x 70 mm L x 41 mm D)\n\u2022 Optional: Weather Resistant Power Adapter (sold separately), Outdoor 4 Battery Extension Pack (available in the US and Canada)\n\u2022 Battery life: Up to 2 years with default settings. Customized settings, use and environmental conditions may affect battery performance\n\u2022 Connectivity: High-speed internet connection (such as broadband, fiber or DSL), Wi-Fi network: 2.4 GHz 802.11b/g/n\n\u2022 Lights: 1 blue LED so you know when it's active (optional), 1 red LED when recording in night vision\n\nIf you find recharging batteries every few months annoying, Blink's lithium AA batteries really do provide that extra convenience. For me, it's well worth the extra $4 to replace them every year or two.\n\nThose long-lasting batteries also make it easier to choose a spot that's harder to access but ideal for a vantage point, like above a garage door, because you know you won't have to make frequent trips up there for recharging.\n\nCap it off with a user-friendly app and a quite reasonable $100 price compared to other outdoor cameras, like the Ring Spotlight for more than $200, and the Blink Outdoor 4 should certainly be on your list if you're looking for a wireless camera. As a bonus, it frequently goes on sale during big Amazon events like Black Friday and Prime Day for as much as 50% off.\n\nIf you want an outdoor camera with more bells and whistles and smart features plus voice assistants beyond Alexa, I recommend the Arlo Pro 5S. You'll have to recharge its battery more often and the camera really needs a subscription (for a fee) to shine, but it can do nearly anything and includes Arlo's advanced AI customization options.",

      "text": "Score Breakdown\nPros\n- Compact outdoor-ready design\n- Long-term AA battery life\n- Easy mount\n- Great app interface\n- Hub included with no additional cost\n- High-quality view for an HD cam\nCons\n- Sync Module 2 hub needs careful placement\n- Audio is a bit rough\nScan our best cam lists and you'll see the Blink Outdoor 4 as a frequent pick for outdoor home security. There's a good reason for this: The Outdoor 4 is an everyman's cam, an intersection of features and price in a compact form that makes it useful for just about anyone. If you can screw in two screws for a mount, you can probably find a purpose for the Outdoor 4.\nAvailable at $100 or below, this outside camera isn't a budget model, but it's not breaking the bank either. And considering Blink's excellent ease of use, the two-way audio, video storage options and effective person detection, the Outdoor 4 gets a lot of things right -- especially if you're willing to pay around $3 per month for a Blink subscription plan. We wish it had compatibility beyond Alexa, and Blink's model doesn't have every bell or whistle (no spotlight, for example), but it remains the sort of outdoor-ready camera that most people are looking for.\nDesign and durability\nThe Blink Outdoor 4 is a model citizen when it comes to compact design and outdoor readiness. The squarish, dark gray frame, a little smaller than 3 inches by 3 inches, can fit nearly anywhere and blends into the background easily.\nOnce equipped with batteries and sealed, the cam's IP65 weather resistance keeps it protected from the elements (although you'll need an outdoor-rated USB-C cable if you aren't using batteries). Installation is simple, with a small two-screw base designed for wood or stucco placement, and a mount that snaps onto the cam and swivels in any direction to control the view.\nTop marks for that cam design, but the Outdoor 4 comes with another piece: It requires a Blink Sync Module 2 hub to connect to Wi-Fi and operate. The great news is that the Outdoor 4 is automatically bundled with a Sync Module 2 at no additional fee, a very small plug-in hub that's nearly effortless to set up. However, it's much more fragile than the Outdoor 4 and you'll have to think carefully about an indoor spot where it's near the cam (more on this below) but can avoid falls or damage.\nBlink Outdoor 4 camera quality & features\nThe Outdoor 4's cam is rated at 1080p/HD, with a field of view stretching to 143 degrees. In practice, I found that resolution very clear for an HD-rated cam, enough to spot any movement and plenty of details across the yard, from blades of grass to flitting birds. The image does get a bit stretched at the edges to fit all the detail in, but once you are used to the view it poses few issues.\nHowever, streaming the live view posed a separate challenge. When I first tested the Outdoor 4, the Sync Module 2 was a bit more than 30 yards away indoors. Relaying the Wi-Fi connection from that far away created streaming troubles, with stuttering live video that struggled to catch up to its HD potential, sometimes lagging out into fuzzy patches.\nIn a quick test, I tried moving the Sync Module 2 much closer to the Outdoor 4, around 10 yards away from the outdoor camera. This immediately solved my streaming issues, presenting a consistently clear image that didn't struggle to buffer. My recommendation is to find an indoor spot for the Sync Module 2 that's as close to the outdoor cam's location as possible -- not an easy task for every placement.\nDoes Blink Outdoor 4 have motion detection & object recognition\nThe Blink Outdoor 4 offers two motion detection options, one for general motion detection and another, locked behind a paywall, for person detection only. Both work quite well. The standard motion detection has options to increase sensitivity but is disinclined to trigger on swaying branches or small animals. The person detection spotted human figures reliably too.\nBlink also offers a 24-hour encapsulation of intermittent shots, 30 seconds of a full day and night to give a perspective on the broad activities of the day. It would be nice if there was additional object recognition like spotting packages in a driveway, but the Outdoor 4 is a more general-use cam.\nAudio quality on Blink Outdoor 4\nTwo-way audio on the Outdoor 4 lets you do everything from warn intruders to call in kids playing in the yard. The mic, while very functional, does pick up a lot of background noise. I found a constant stream of light static from breezes, traffic and general streaming issues.\nAgain, audio did improve with the new placement of the Sync Module 2, but you can still expect noticeable background noise.\nThe speaker works well, and volume can be readily adjusted, so you won't have to worry about your voice getting lost in the outdoor spaces. Quality will quickly drop off after 15 to 20 feet, but that's not uncommon in an outdoor cam, especially one that gets mounted in higher places.\nApp settings and controls\nOne of my favorite things about Blink cams is the app. It makes setup swift even for beginners (have your Wi-Fi password handy), and settings are easy to figure out. Adjusting motion sensitivity and volume is a breeze, switching between objection detection or armed modes offer intuitive icons and all triggered videos are saved in the Clips section for quick review.\nWhen you head into live view by selecting the cam image, you are met with a selection of other easy-to-use tools, including save, mute/unmute to talk and speaker on/off to listen. Device settings let you look at battery life turn on temperature alerts, change the cam name and more. Nothing is overly complicated or out of place -- it's simply one of the best security cam UIs around.\nHow long is the battery life?\nThe Blink Outdoor 4, like some other Blink models, offers an interesting wireless proposition. It comes with two lithium AA batteries, rated for up to two years of life with average use. Replacing them is a pain, but you rarely have to worry about it. It's a unique, worry-free choice that's hard to review, but we'll be happy to revisit in two years and let you know how it's going. So far the batteries are working just fine.\nIn the meantime, you also have the option to add a larger battery expansion pack to the camera so that it lasts even longer, but it's not necessary unless you really want a four-year rated battery life instead.\nNote: Despite the name, these lithium AA batteries aren't rechargeable, they merely last a long time. You'll have to purchase new batteries when they finally fade.\nDoes Blink Outdoor 4 require a subscription?\nThe Outdoor 4 has a significant advantage when it comes to video storage. Since the Sync module 2 comes bundled at no extra charge, users have an option for local storage. I attached a USB flash drive to the tiny hub and was able to switch to local video saves with relatively little effort.\nThe other option is a Blink subscription for cloud video storage. Blink has a good security track record, but you will have to pay at least $3 per (or $30 per year) for the service. Blink also keeps its person detection behind the paywall, which is a significant boost to usability, so it's worth seriously considering the fees. Fortunately, they're among the lowest monthly fees on the market for these kinds of add-ons (Ring, for example, starts at $5).\nDoes Blink Outdoor 4 work with Alexa, iOS, or Android?\nAs an Amazon brand, Blink is built for Alexa. That's great for Alexa fans: I was able to set up Blink in Alexa and start controlling the cam and viewing it through Echo Shows in under a minute. Alexa is also happy to enable two-way audio through the cam or give announcements when it detects a person.\nThe downside to the seamless Alexa experience is that the Blink Outdoor 4 doesn't really work with anything else. Google Assistant and Siri fans won't get the same options, and the cam won't play well with existing home security systems from brands like Vivint or Adobe.\nFinal verdict on Blink Outdoor 4\nThe Blink Outdoor 4 occupies a sweet spot in the outdoor security world, a general-use cam ready for the elements and providing high-quality services with a simple-to-use interface. It's not exactly high-end -- the resolution, field of view, audio and detection features fall short of the top cams we've tested. But it's very good at what it does, at a relatively reasonable price ($100) and a long-term wireless design.\nAdd in the very compact design with its simple mount, and the Outdoor 4 is hard to beat for homeowners that want an all-purpose eye on their yard or driveway. If you're looking for a few more upgrades like a spotlight, extra object detection or higher resolution, hop over to our guide to the best outdoor cams and the best cameras with lights before making up your mind."

      "text": "Summertime can often mean taking some time off to travel and get away from the home. One of the best things to do to prevent being a victim of the rising rates of package theft or a home invasion while you're on vacation is to get a security camera on your home. A wireless battery camera is easy to install and can be placed almost anywhere. The batteries are long-lasting and can sometimes be powered with solar panels. We've tested many cameras to find which ones are worth buying.\nOur Picks\nOUTDOOR SECURITY CAMERA DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $100 (save $160)\n- $25 (save $16)\n- $110 (save $110)\n- $200 (save $250)\nBest overall wireless home security camera\nWe've tested dozens of battery-powered cam models, and our experts have chosen the feature-rich Arlo Pro 5S as the best wireless security camera. Arlo\u2019s Pro 5S packs all the smart capabilities you could want into one device, plus excellent voice assistant compatibility, the well-designed Arlo app and the option to expand capabilities with an Arlo hub. It\u2019s an easy choice if you\u2019re willing to pay a bit more for a compact wireless device packed with the latest smart features.\nWhile the Arlo Pro 5S is pricey, you don't have to spend a lot to get a great security camera. For those on a budget, we've included a range of affordable wireless options we've tested that provide solid home protection. Our list includes options that have extra-long battery life, along with some that are portable (although there are some spots you'll want to avoid).\nWe also have guides for the most affordable security cameras, the best solar-powered wireless cams and outdoor models built for any weather.\nBest wireless home security cameras of 2025\nPros\n- Strong battery life with low-power mode\n- 12x zoom and night vision\n- Spotlight\n- 2K resolution\n- Broad smart home support\n- Video storage local or cloud\nCons\n- No Apple support without adding a hub\n- On the expensive side\nWhy I like it:\nThe Arlo Pro 5S 2K-resolution camera brings more to the table than any wireless cam we\u2019ve seen so far, including a battery rated for a very healthy six months and low power settings (enhanced by an optional Arlo system connection) to extend that to six months.\nThis camera offers as many features as possible to give users choices, including extra functionality like 12x zoom and color night vision. Smart home compatibility is some of the best we\u2019ve seen with support for Alexa, Google Home, Samsung and IFTTT settings, plus Apple support if you're willing to add a Base Station. You can also use the built-in spotlight and siren to ward away intruders if you feel uncomfortable, or tap into the two-way audio to have a conversation.\nFinally, the Arlo Pro 5S also offers a subscription service with tiers for cloud storage and professional monitoring. You can choose to buy a hub device like Arlo SmartHub and connect local storage if you prefer to stay off a plan. However, the latest Arlo plan includes handy tricks, including the ability to recognize fires and listen for specific sounds like dogs barking.\nWho is this for:\nBuyers who want everything in one cam and don't mind considering a subscription fee or add-on -- especially Apple users.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nThose looking for the cheapest cam, fans of simple apps and feature sets.\nPros\n- Versatile placement options\n- Battery life performs well\n- Great distance-related motion detection features\n- High-quality two-way audio\nCons\n- Expensive for an HD cam at over $150 without discounts\n- Video storage requires $5 subscription\nWhy I like it:\nWith both mounting and table-stand options, you can take the Ring Stick Up Cam anywhere so it makes the most use of its wireless capabilities. You can move it from watching a child sleep to checking on the living room to monitoring an outdoor deck space where kids (or adults) are playing. (You get the idea.) Or find the perfect spot and mount it for a permanent HD view supported by HDR and color night vision, which our tests find all worked well.\nWhile the Stick Up Cam Pro performs well inside or out, its features are most effective outdoors. These include 3D motion tracking with a \u201cBird\u2019s Eye\u201d view that can track where people move around your yard. Two-way audio is also included, but you\u2019ll need a Ring Protect plan if you want video storage. If you\u2019re put off by the Pro\u2019s fairly high price, a standard Ring Stick Up cam is available for significantly less.\nNote that Ring last year changed its policy regarding police requests for user footage, limiting law enforcement to only emergency life-or-death requests for video instead of more casual orders. That\u2019s a bit of welcome privacy compared to its previous stance.\nWho is this for:\nPeople who want to move a security cam with them, fans of great night vision with larger backyards.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nThose uninterested in subscriptions or those who want more smart home options than than Alexa.\nPros\n- Long two-year battery life\n- Included hub for storage\n- Motion detection with zone control\n- Two-way audio\n- Night vision\nCons\n- Limited to Alexa support\nWhy I like it:\nIf you\u2019re hesitant to get a wireless security camera because of the battery requirements, you have a couple of solutions. One is a solar panel, which we\u2019ll discuss below, but another option is finding a camera with excellent battery life so you don\u2019t have to worry about it for extended periods.\nWhile battery life does depend on how often cameras are activated, the Blink Outdoor 4 can last up to two years in the right conditions before needing a recharge with its lithium AA batteries. That battery life seems accurate, too -- ours has been operating for over a year and the battery life is still going strong.\nOther important staples on the Outdoor 4 include two-way audio, infrared night vision and motion zone control. We especially like that it comes with a Sync Module 2 for Wi-Fi connections and local storage, so you don\u2019t have to rely on the Blink subscription unless you prefer to pay for extras. Keep in mind, like other Amazon Blink cams this model only works with Alexa, so it\u2019s most useful if you\u2019re already part of the Amazon ecosystem with items like an Echo Show.\nWho is this for:\nBuyers look for an all-purpose outdoor cam with amazing battery life and a simple app.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nUsers who want more than Amazon Alexa, people who want a spotlight option.\nPros\n- Easy to install and manage\n- Google Assistant and Alexa support\n- Free 3 hours of video storage\n- Google AI is smart and useful\n- Fun magnetic base design\nCons\n- Shorter battery life\n- 1080p resolution could be higher for the price\nWhy I like it:\nGoogle\u2019s Nest cam (and most Nest products) are designed to be extra easy to use and install, ideal for people who want quick eyes on their important belongings with minimal work. Set up the Nest\u2019s mount indoors or outdoors, and use the magnetic connection to snap the cam on, adjust it and take it offer easily whenever you need to recharge.\nThat makes maintenance especially easy, which is important because of the lower battery life on this camera. In our tests, we found the design excellent if a bit bulky, and we liked the floodlight option too if you don't mind wiring in another component.\nThe HD cam included night vision and two-way audio, plus Google\u2019s video storage package which includes up to 3 hours of cloud storage for free, a welcome deal only offered by a few brands these days. It also works with both Alexa and Google Assistant, so you don\u2019t need to be heavily invested in Google products to get a lot out of this cam.\nWho is this for:\nFans of Google Home and free AI object detection, people who like magnetic mounts for angle adjustment.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nUsers who don't like cloud video, people looking for a very lightweight cam.\nPros\n- Powerful floodlight\n- 2K resolution\n- Apple Home compatibility with hub purchase\n- 160-degree viewing angle\n- Optional magnetic charging cable\nCons\n- Floodlight can drain battery fast, sometimes in just a few days\nWhy I like it:\nA floodlight camera is ideal for illuminating darker parts of your yard or driveway, but those tend to be spots where electrical wiring doesn\u2019t reach, so a battery camera can work very well. We found this Arlo model filled with impressive features including 2K resolution and color night vision.\nLike our top Arlo pick, it's of the few security cams that works with Apple Home, although you will need to purchase an additional SmartHub. It also has an extra-wide viewing angle of 160 degrees, making these cams good for viewing broad spaces.\nWhile you can change some settings for motion detection, object recognition and similar features, remember that the floodlight will usually trigger movement. With a floodlight rated up to 2,000 lumens, that can be a serious drain on battery life and we\u2019ve seen users complain that their batteries only last a few days. If this is a problem for you, the cam does come with a magnetic charging cable that\u2019s suited for outdoor use, so you can rig up a wired alternative or spring for a solar panel connection, so you still have options.\nWho is this for:\nUsers who want bright floodlights in a very specific spot.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who aren't fans of charging batteries for a wireless camera.\nPros\n- Free cloud storage for 3 hours\n- Two-way audio\n- Google's AI object detection works well\n- Easy placement with the battery model\nCons\n- Battery life is a little short at several months\n- 130-degree Field of view may be limited for large front yards\nWhy I like it:\nWhile Google\u2019s Nest Doorbell does come with a wired version, we prefer the battery model. In our testing, we found it easier to install to get just the right view from your front door, and the battery easily lasts at least a few months even with regular activations. Plus, that same Nest deal for 3 free hours of cloud storage is hard to beat in a video doorbell.\nFeatures like two-way audio are even more important on a doorbell, and Google also uses some of its AI expertise to help identify packages, people and vehicles with other options locked behind the subscription. Plus, you get a few color options to better match your door and trim. If you don\u2019t mind using the Google Home app to control the device, this is one of the best video doorbells we\u2019ve found as a wireless model.\nWho is this for:\nPeople who want to stop porch pirates without paying subscription fees, fans of familiar face technology.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nUsers who want Apple compatibility, people more interested in backyard or garage cams instead.\nPros\n- Amazing features for a cam often under $100\n- 2K resolution\n- Durable outdoor design\n- Built-in spotlight\n- Color night vision\n- Good smart home support\n- Great solar options\nCons\n- An $8 Arlo subscription will raise that low price\nWhy I like it:\nNot all of Arlo\u2019s cams are as pricey as our top pick: This second-gen, 2K-resolution Essential model is one of the most affordable on our list, and if you wait until a holiday sale you can save even more. In our tests we found the weighty model well-suited for all kinds of outdoor weather, with the same smooth design and user-friendly Arlo app experience as its other cams. Battery life is a little low with all those features but in our testing it still lasts several months before running out and is rated for over a year with minimal use.\nYou also get all the valuable Arlo features like two-way audio, color night vision and solid smart home compatibility. There\u2019s even a built-in spotlight for dark conditions. If you don\u2019t want to worry about battery life, this is also one of our favorite cameras to pair with a solar panel, a bundle you can easily pick while still keeping the price reasonable. Just keep in mind how much Arlo cams benefit from an $8 subscription, which will add to the cost.\nWho is this for:\nFans of cheaper wireless cams that still have a little of everything.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who would rather trade wireless features and fees for saving the most money possible.\nWireless home security cameras compared\n| | Arlo Pro 5S 2K Security Camera | Ring Stick Up Cam Pro | Blink Outdoor 4 | Google Nest Indoor/Outdoor Cam (2nd-gen) | Arlo Pro 3 with Floodlight | Google Nest Doorbell Battery Model (2nd-gen) | Arlo Essential Cam (2nd-Gen) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Price | $180 | $180 | $100 | $180 | $250 | $180 | $100 |\n| Resolution | 2K with 12x digital zoom | 1080p/HD | 1080p/HD | 1080p/HD | 2K | 720p | 2K |\n| Night vision | Color night vision with spotlight | Color night vision | Infrared night vision | Night vision and HDR | Color night vision | Night vision with HDR | Color Night Vision |\n| Audio | Two-way audio | Two-way audio | Two-way audio | Two-way Audio | Two-way audio | Two-way audio | Two-Way Audio |\n| Video storage | Cloud storage with subscription or local storage with SmartHub | Cloud storage only with subscription | With subscription or with included local storage hub | 3 hours free cloud storage, more with subscription | Cloud storage with subscription or local storage with hub | 3 hours free cloud storage, more with subscription | Cloud storage only with Arlo subscription |\n| Motion detection | Yes, object detection with subscription | Yes, with privacy and bird's eye zones | Yes, with person detection (plan required) | Yes with person, vehicle, animal, and familiar face | Yes with object detection | Yes, with person, vehicle, animal, package and familiar face detection | Yes, object detection with subscription |\n| Voice assistant | Amazon Alexa, Google Home/Assistant, Samsung SmartThings, IFTTT | Amazon Alexa | Amazon Alexa | Amazon Alexa, Google Home/Assistant | Amazon Alexa, Google Home/Assistant, Apple Home/Siri | Amazon Alexa, Google Home/Assistant | Amazon Alexa, Google Home/Assistant, IFTTT |\n| Review score | N/A | 8/10 (earlier model) | N/A | 8.4/10 | 9/10 | 8/10 | N/A |\nOther wireless cams we tested\nWyze Cam Outdoor v2: Wyze cameras have a lot going for them, including affordability and strong feature sets, which is why we've picked them in several of our lists before. Wyze is currently facing repeated security breaches and vulnerabilities, including a 2024 incident that let 13,000 people see through strangers' cams (a similar incident also happened in late 2023). Until Wyze gets a handle on its security leaks, we can't recommend it as a brand.\nArlo Pro 4: The Arlo Pro 4 remains an excellent choice for a security camera. The Arlo Pro 5S nudged it off the list for us, but you may be able to save some money with the Arlo Pro 4 and still many of the same features.\nRing Stick Up Cam: While this cam is more affordable, we ultimately prefer the better features on the Pro model instead.\nSimpliSafe Outdoor Camera Series 2: This is a great camera -- if you use a SimpliSafe system and are willing to pay for a more advanced subscription so you get all the AI goodies. But it's not a standalone camera, and so ultimately not a good fit for this list.\nReolink Argus Eco plus solar panel: While we did choose this Reolink cam as an affordable option for solar-powered wireless cameras, we prefer the much easier installation of Arlo's solar cam.\nTP-Link Tapo C420S1: This powerful 2K camera is affordable and benefits from Tapo's user-friendly features, including local video storage. It didn't quite make our list -- we found better budget options, and the design of this camera is a bit awkward for mounting -- but it's still worth a look.\nFactors to consider when choosing a wireless security camera\nDoes it work with smart home platforms? If so, do the smart features work well together?\nNowadays, home security cameras are expected to work with at least one major smart home platform. Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple HomeKit are the main ones you need to look for. Apple Home app support is usually the hardest to find.\nHow's the live view?\nWireless security cameras and video doorbells are often exposed to direct sunlight, weather and other natural elements, but many others are installed under porches, near shady trees and in all sorts of other settings. The camera must have crisp, clear video footage or even night vision so you don't get stuck with grainy and unusable footage.\nInstallation\nWireless camera installation is typically with a screwed-in mount. Some use adhesive, but that works best in mild weather and smoother surfaces, which are often in short supply outdoors, so take that option with a grain of salt. Don't drill into anything that you want to keep safe from moisture unless you're willing to carefully caulk the edges of the cam, too.\nLocal vs. cloud storage\nNot all video storage is equal. You have two main options and picking one is up to your personal preference. There's cloud storage, which sends your video footage to a remote server to be saved, and local storage, which relies on a separate accessory or piece of hardware, usually a microSD card, to hold any footage you'd like to save.\nUsually, cloud storage requires a monthly fee, and companies typically reserve the right to share that footage with others in case of emergencies, such as an FBI search. But it's very easy to manage and you don't have to be at home to change it. Local storage is cheaper but more limited by how much a storage card can hold, and may not have the same history or analysis options of cloud data.\nMotion detection and recognition\nMotion detection is one of the most important features of DIY security cameras. You'll want a feature that automatically records video and sends you alerts when the camera picks up motion. You also don't want to get alerts and useless videos every time leaves blow by (or cars drive by, deer walk past, etc.). That's where object detection comes in useful: The best security cameras can distinguish between vehicles, animals and people. The best versions like Google's AI detection can also detect packages and, if you allow them, familiar faces at your door.\nBattery life and management\nWireless cams live and then literally die based on their battery life. When looking for a good battery, keep in mind that ratings are subjective, and batteries will drain faster depending on how often the camera is activated. We've found that most wireless security cameras fall in line with their ratings and last several months with at least a few daily activations. Charging typically takes several hours, leaving it overnight is a great way to get a full charge.\nRing's Outdoor 4 cam is a notable outlier with its extra-long battery life, and solar cams offer an alternative way of charging.\nNo matter what battery option you pick, consider installing a wireless camera somewhere that's relatively easy to reach to bring the camera or its battery pack inside for charging. Not everyone wants to climb a ladder every time.\nConnectivity\nMost wireless cameras need Wi-Fi to work. Some security cameras can operate on PoE or Power over Ethernet, but then they won't be wireless, so a strong Wi-Fi network is important. This usually depends on your router more than your cams, but keep in mind Wi-Fi signals need to reach across exterior walls, sometimes multiple obstacles. Our Wi-Fi works well for exterior cams at ranges of 30 to 50 feet, but your results may vary so try to be a little flexible with placement and always test Wi-Fi before you drill.\nPrivacy and security\nYou may want to look up privacy policies for the camera you are interested, and see if the brand has had any recent security issues. We look for brands that act quickly and make significant changes when they find a security issue like Eufy's security breach back in the early 2020s or how Wyze cams had multiple security flaws in just a few months. We also like to see changes like Ring removing its casual option for police to request user videos.\nHow we test wireless security cameras\nHands-on testing is core to our evaluations of home security products. In short, when it comes to security cameras, we pay special attention to resolution, night vision and latency, extra features, general performance and overall value. We evaluate all of these elements in a real home environment over a week, posting up wireless cameras indoors and outside to see how they perform.\nSetup and detection features\nWireless camera installation is usually simple by nature, but we pay close attention to the design, weight, mounting options and general fit of the cam for at home use. That includes testing magnetic mounts, screw vs. adhesive installation and how easy it is to adjust a cam to a certain and keep it there.\nVideo quality and night vision\nIn testing, we take a close look at app live views, video recordings and general clarity. Latency is also important: Most cams will take at least a few seconds to bump up to higher resolutions, but we like see as short of times as possible, and even shorter for motion detection to trigger.\nWe'll also take a look at cam night vision in the dark, a field that has come leaps and bounds in recent years and is usually enough for any quality cam to capture nighttime details for the average yard.\nBattery life and weather resistance\nBy testing these cameras for longer, we can get a good look at battery life over weeks. Weather resistance is harder to test, but depending on the season we can expose the camera to hot sun, rainy storms or winter snow to see how it handles everything.\nSmart home integrations\nIf the camera has support for options like Apple Home and Google Home, we also try connections and controls from there. Since Matter support has been slow to come to cameras, this is one place we often run into bugs or features that are missing on certain platforms, so it's important to test.\nIf you want to read more about our review process, check out our in-depth article on how we test home security cameras and video doorbells.\nWireless security camera FAQs\nCan wireless cameras work without internet?\nWhat's a good affordable wireless security camera system?\nHow do I place a wireless security camera?\nIs it legal to use a security camera on my property?\nHow long do wireless cameras handle power outages or internet disruptions?\nRecent updates\nSpring 2025 update: We decided to add Arlo's Essential camera as a viable budget option, especially with its frequent discounts. Arlo cams more or less need a subscription to really take advantage of their advanced features, but it's still a worthy option for those who want low initial costs for a very, very good camera."

      "text": "One of the biggest changes in recent home security is all the valuable information security cameras can give you, from updates about packages to AI video searches and facial recognition. It can be surprisingly useful, but you need to put your camera in the right place for it to all work.\nI've tested dozens of cameras in every location inside and outside my home, from shelf-mounted model to magnetic bases and even solar panels. Here's where cameras work best, depending on exactly what you want them to do.\nRead more: How to Give Old Home Devices New Life as Birdcams, Energy Savers and More\nWhere should you install a home security camera?\n1. Exterior: Front door\nYou might assume that intruders always sneak into side entrances, but statistics from the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors show that 34% of burglars use the front door. It's also where package thieves are likely to strike. A camera at your main entrance keeps tabs on everybody going in and out of your home, from family members and babysitters to maintenance people, delivery people and more.\nPro tip: Video doorbells are great picks for the front door. You can use them as the primary camera or in conjunction with another outdoor camera aimed at the yard or garage.\n2. Exterior: Back and side doors\nDoors that are out of sight allow visitors to enter undetected, whether they're invited or not. NACHI statistics show 22% of break-ins happen through the back door. To ensure full knowledge of everyone who enters and exits, add cameras to your secondary doors, especially if one of them is used as often or more often than your front door, or if one (like a basement door) seems particularly enticing or accessible to a potential intruder.\n3. Exterior: Garage and driveway\nGarages are a common target of burglars because they're one of the weakest entry points. A camera pointed at your garage and/or driveway keeps a watchful eye on bikes, tools, grills, sports equipment, cars and everyone that handles them. If your garage is detached, the camera helps you stay connected. If the garage is attached, the extra layer of security monitors another possible entryway into your home. If there's a gate at the end of your driveway, you may want a camera there to spot anyone attempting to get in.\n4. Exterior: Wide yard views\nMonitoring the yard will help you keep tabs on anyone scoping out your house. It's also handy for capturing the activities of kids, animals and trespassers. As with garages, look for cams that have a wide field of view to capture lots of action, at least 130 degrees and preferably more. If you have a yard entrance, like a fence gate or a shed doorway, make sure the camera can see it.\n5. Interior: Common areas\nPlacing cameras in gathering points like the kitchen or living room is a great way to see if the kids are doing what they're supposed to do, if the babysitter is attentive, what the pets are getting into, or to check on household help like cleaners and repairmen. Consider prioritizing any rooms that have large ground-floor windows \u2014 that way you can see if anyone tampers with them or uses one as a break-in point. If there's a key point of interest like a sofa, pet bed or living room play area, make sure the camera can see it.\n6. Interior: Main stairway or hallway\nPlace a camera in the main thoroughfares inside your home to make it difficult for someone to move about undetected. If someone breaks in through a bathroom, bedroom or another unmonitored area, they'll still be captured on camera if they move about the house.\nHere's where you should never install a security camera\n- Places that violate your neighbor's privacy. Cameras are great for your safety, but you need to be mindful of the privacy of others in your neighborhood. In general, homeowners are allowed to have outdoor security cameras that cover a broad area, and it's usually OK to capture your neighbor's public-facing property in the background of your footage. Learn more with our full guide.\n- Bedrooms and bathrooms. The urge to keep a watchful eye on kids or elderly folks in your household is understandable. However, some areas have a warranted expectation of privacy. Plus, if you use a monitoring service, you run the risk of a hacker tapping into a camera that has access to your private spaces. Luckily, there are plenty of alternatives. Baby monitors are a smart choice for very young kids' rooms. Motion detectors and glass break sensors, as part of a connected home security system, can be added to doors and windows. Personal medical alert systems are strong choices for seniors.\nTips for outdoor security cam placement\nOnce you decide which locations to monitor, you also need to plan your mounting decisions. These tips make easy work of this step:\n- Install cameras 8 to 10 feet from the ground. This height is low enough to capture fine details but high enough to be out of easy reach of thieves and vandals.\n- Don't point cameras directly at the sun. Bright light causes glare and high contrast in your footage, which makes it hard to tell what's going on. Consider the movement of the sun and angle your cameras for indirect light.\n- Protect the camera from the elements. Top outdoor security cameras have ample weather- and waterproofing, but they are not all equal. Choose a camera that's appropriately rated for your climate, and place it under eaves or in another semi-protected area if you can.\n- Avoid places too close to branches or bushes. Plants grow over time and can block your security camera.\n- Let cameras be visible. Visible cameras can act as a deterrent against theft, and that's one of the best uses of your security system.\nTips for indoor security cam placement\n- Corners are your friends. Hanging an indoor camera in the corner of a room usually gives you the largest possible vantage point.\n- Choose a shelf for versatility. If you don't have to mount your cam, placing it on a shelf allows you to make adjustments later or even move it to another room.\n- Windows can cause reflection issues. Pointing a camera at the window might degrade its image quality. Many security cameras have infrared light technology, which aids in motion detection and enables the cameras to function in low light. IR light can reflect off windows and other glass objects and obscure your footage, especially in the dark. If your footage looks washed out or whited out, there is likely a reflection problem.\n- Angle for indirect light. Again, direct light will wash out your footage. With indoor cameras, be mindful of lamps, light fixtures and bright windows. Avoid facing your camera directly toward these light sources.\nDo video doorbells have special installation rules?\nPosition video doorbells so they have a good view of your porch or entryway. These cameras are angled a bit differently than other security cameras, so follow the manual instructions carefully. Usually, they need to be placed around 4 feet up from the base of the front door. In tighter spaces, video doorbells should be angled outward to capture as much activity as possible. Fortunately, many video doorbells come with a special wedge just for this purpose. Otherwise, put it where people would naturally press a doorbell.\nAre there super-portable security cams?\nIn some cases, you may want a security camera that you can move around all the time. That makes it easy to put down wherever the kids are playing, indoors or outside, or to focus on a problem spot where things keep going missing (avoid workplace refrigerators, please).\nIn these cases, we recommend battery-powered indoor/outdoor cams that you can move anywhere and that are weather-resistant in case they're left out in the rain. One candidate is Ring's Stick-Up Cam Pro ($180), which has an excellent collection of watchful features. Another option is the Google Nest Indoor/Outdoor Cam battery model ($176), which is often shown mounted but can also come with a tabletop mount.\nFor more home security tips, check out how to prevent your home security cameras from being hacked and the best cheap home security systems you can buy."

      "text": "If you're looking to celebrate your summer vacation in peace, you'll want to get the best outdoor home security cameras possible. A recent CNET survey shows that 71% of adults are thinking about how to protect their homes from thefts like porch piracy. Installing a security camera is a wonderful way to keep an eye on your home and patio, whether you're at work or enjoying your free time.\nOur Picks\nOUTDOOR SECURITY CAMERA DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $100 (save $160)\n- $25 (save $16)\n- $110 (save $110)\n- $200 (save $250)\nChoosing the right outdoor security camera can be tricky with so many options to pick from. That's why, after 150 hours of testing, our experts evaluated installation, video quality and features like motion detection and chose these top picks.\nWhat is the best overall outdoor home security camera?\nAfter rigorous testing, we're recommending the Arlo Pro 5S 2K wireless security camera. Its combination of features and compatibility is unparalleled. It packs in audio, a spotlight, a high-res lens and (if you pay for it) Arlo's extra-advanced AI detection features. Plus, at $120, it's far more affordable now than when it first came out at $250 and remains one of the best outdoor security cameras we've tested.\nAfter more than five years of testing cameras from Blink, Eufy, Lorex, Nest, Ring and TP-Link, we've also picked several other models. Whether you're looking for a broad floodlight or would prefer a budget cam that costs much less, check out the options below. We've also included tips on what makes an outdoor cam worthwhile, information on how we test and guidance on how to place cameras around your home (and where not to put security cams).\nBest outdoor home security cameras\nPros\n- 160-degree view\n- 12x digital zoom and autotracking\n- DIY-friendly\n- Long battery life with low-power modes,\n- Integrated spotlight\n- Useful down to -20 degrees,\n- Two-way audio\nCons\n- Full features, including highest resolution, require subscription\n- Expensive\n- Local storage is even more expensive\nWhy I like it:\nIf cost is no problem and you're looking for the latest features, the Arlo Pro 5S 2K is a top-line DIY model with a solid set of features. The 2K video resolution yields extra detail (although a subscription is required for maximum resolution), a 160-degree field of view is great on a cam this size and color night vision works very well to enhance images in dark conditions. It's wireless for flexible installation options and the battery is better than ever (rated up to eight months) with new low-power modes to help decrease those tiresome recharging sessions.\nThe outdoor camera also has particularly useful extras for an all-purpose security camera. The integrated spotlight turns on in low-light conditions (although you can control this via the app) and I found that the auto-tracking and the 12x zoom function help focus coverage on the most important details. The two-way audio is also a nice touch if you prefer to have cam-based conversations or call out strangers. With UV resistance, weather resistance and an operating temperature range down to minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit, it's ready for homes in nearly any climate.\nWhile the camera gets added benefits like optimized battery life from being connected to an Arlo Security System or base station, it\u2019s still easy to use it solo. The Arlo Secure subscription not only unlocks 2K resolution streaming but also enables cloud recording and, at higher tiers, enables Arlo's numerous customizable AI detection and alert features. If you prefer local storage, you\u2019ll have to add an Arlo SmartHub or Base Station, which can cost more than $100.\nWho is this for:\nUsers who want a camera that does everything with plenty to tinker with over time and don't mind paying a subscription fee.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nBuyers who want a simple cam without a lot of features to learn and people who want to avoid monthly fees.\nPros\n- Versatile camera with antennas for Wi-Fi\n- 98-foot night vision\n- 2K resolution\n- Siren included\n- Local storage option\nCons\n- Plug-in model makes installation more difficult\n- Two-way audio has limited use when watching a driveway\nWhy I like it:\nWorried about your car's catalytic converter or windows? Sometimes it can be difficult to watch a full driveway with a security camera, especially if it gets really dark. A camera equipped with an automatic siren, spotlight and night vision up to 98 feet away, like the TP-Link Tapo C310, can be one of your most effective tools for keeping trespassers at bay. You can position the camera to watch specific zones, like a driveway, at scheduled times and blare its siren and spotlight when anyone crosses the detection line.\nThe outdoor camera also features 2K resolution, Alexa and Google Assistant compatibility, and local storage via a microSD card slot (card not included). If you want cloud storage, Tapo Care plans start around $3 per month per camera and include 30 days of event recording. The IP66 weather rating will keep it safe, too.\nWhile the camera supports Wi-Fi or PoE (Power over Ethernet) if your Wi-Fi won't reach that far away from the house, it will require a wired connection. Unlike many wired outdoor cameras, the C310 doesn't support wiring directly into a junction box. You'll need an outdoor-rated socket to plug it in, which is its one downside.\nWho is this for:\nPeople with long, dark driveways who have an outdoor outlet handy.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nUsers without outdoor outlets who don't want to hire an electrician.\nPros\n- Excellent LTE option for zones outside Wi-Fi\n- Can still use Wi-Fi to save data\n- Spotlight and night vision included\n- Location tracking for finding lost cams\n- Great weather protection\nCons\n- A bit pricey\n- Really needs an Arlo plan to unlock all features\nWhy I like it:\nIf you need a camera to keep watch over a place where Wi-Fi doesn't reach, (such as construction sites, adjacent workshops or camping trips), you may want to shop for a smart security camera that connects over cellular data. Your top two options are the Arlo Go 2 and the Eufy 4G Starlight Cam, each of which includes a SIM card slot for cellular connectivity along with similar features, including night vision and customizable motion alerts. I personally advise the 1080p Arlo model.\nFor one, the Arlo Go 2 includes a microSD card slot for local storage whereas the Eufy camera only has a limiting 8GB of built-in storage. Also, the Arlo Go 2 can connect over LTE and Wi-Fi while the Eufy 4G Starlight Cam doesn't support Wi-Fi. That makes the Go 2 the more flexible of the two cameras, suitable for close to home or watching far-away properties -- and I like the Arlo app much better, while Eufy's app tends to be messy for first-time users.\nKeep in mind that you'll need an Arlo Secure plan starting at $8 per month to enable advanced AI notifications, the highest video resolution and cloud recordings. A microSD card slot is available for local storage (and to help keep from running into data caps or similar issues), but you'll be giving up those additional features.\nWho is this for:\nBuyers looking for off-site cameras and cameras that don\u2019t need to rely on Wi-Fi and people who have especially large properties to watch\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who won\u2019t want to pay more for a cellular connection.\nPros\n- Compact design with bright LEDs and easy battery swapping\n- Color night vision\n- Customization for motion detection\n- Full Alexa compatibility\nCons\n- Subscription required to unlock useful features\n- Spotlight may be too small for large areas\nWhy I like it:\nA dedicated spotlight cam focuses a beam of light in a specific direction, helping you light up dark porches, walkways, patios and corners of your yard where visibility is lacking. The Ring Spotlight Cam Pro upgrades the Plus model in several ways, including 3D motion detection, HDR views and enhanced audio.\nFew spotlight cams have such a compact design with durable LED bars that make it easy to position and angle the camera (140-degree field of view) in many directions. When power is low, the pop-out battery is easy to recharge without messing with your perfect angle.\nThe 1080p cam comes with color night vision, two-way audio and a siren you can sound when necessary. There are also privacy zones and motion zones you can tweak to control where the motion detection focuses. It can handle temperatures down to minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit, so it\u2019s no slouch during winter, either.\nRing\u2019s camera is designed to work with a Ring Protect plan, which starts at $5 per month and we consider it more or less mandatory for this cam. It enables valuable features, including the ability to record footage to the cloud, recognize people (and ignore other movement), and switch to an away mode. The biggest problem with this feature set is how expensive it is, making this the priciest cam on my list.\nWho is this for:\nBuyers looking for a compact spotlight camera that provides a lot of info about what's happening around the yard.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nBuyers who want to save money and users who don't like Alexa.\nPros\n- Battery rated for two years\n- Includes Sync Module 2\n- Dual-zone motion detection\n- Full Alexa compatibility\nCons\n- 1080p resolution could be higher\n- AA lithium batteries are awkward\n- Subscription required for full features\nWhy I like it:\nWireless security cams offer a lot to like for the modern homeowner. You can install them at nearly any awkward angle to cover blind spots or find the perfect vantage point, and there\u2019s never any need to call an electrician. In return, you have to manage battery power, and that can be a tough sell when the best spot for an outdoor camera is a hard-to-reach area. Blink\u2019s fourth-generation outdoor cam addresses the issue head-on with powered AA lithium batteries rated for up to two years of use before you have to worry about replacing them -- mine is set to last even longer than that, the last time I checked.\nBattery life isn\u2019t the only thing the Outdoor 4 brings to the table. This battery-powered camera offers a 1080p resolution, infrared night vision, two-way audio and dual-zone motion detection. Amazon\u2019s security platform has full Alexa compatibility, too, so you can look at a live view from an Echo Show, among other tricks.\nNote that the Blink Outdoor 4 comes with a Sync Module 2 for local storage so you don\u2019t have to worry about buying a hub, but you will need a USB drive to connect to it. A Blink subscription, which starts at $3 per month, adds cloud storage and person detection.\nWho is this for:\nAnyone looking for an all-purpose outdoor camera that they don't have to worry about recharging.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who really don't like Alexa and users who want a high resolution camera.\nPros\n- Compact, wireless and easy to install\n- Google's useful AI detection\n- 6x digital zoom\n- Excellent free video storage\n- Indoor or outdoor placement\nCons\n- Field of view is a little small\n- May run into problems at lower temps\nWhy I like it:\nGoogle Nest's bobbly wireless cam has secrets: It\u2019s surprisingly powerful, offers infrared LEDs for night vision and comes with IP54 weather resistance for outside use. It's also equipped with free AI detection for people, packages and animals to cut down on unnecessary alerts while giving you important info.\nThe 1080p model has a 130-degree field of view and you can quickly adjust its focus thanks to the 6x digital zoom and easy-to-install base. Motion detection, two-way audio and compatibility with Google Assistant and Alexa round this cam off nicely.\nAI alerts aren't the only free feature, either. I also like how this camera include three free hours of video storage, usually enough to take a break and check the details of an alert that you received.\nNest Aware plans add more features but that\u2019s a more-than-competitive deal if you want to avoid subscription fees. Plus, you can easily move it inside or outside depending on where you think you need security the most. Just be careful of temperatures that fall below freezing as this cam isn't rated for especially cold conditions.\nWho is this for:\nUsers who like AI object recognition and some cloud storage but don't want to pay for it and buyers who may want to move the camera inside, especially over the winter.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who dislike Nest and Google Home and those looking for a high-resolution camera.\nPros\n- Built-in solar recharging\n- Spotlight\n- Smart motion detection\n- Alexa and Google compatibility\nCons\n- Only 8GB of local storage to work with\n- Eufy's app experience can get pretty messy\nWhy I like it:\nSolar cameras offer an alternative to the traditional home security tech: A cam that you can theoretically keep charged with a few hours of well-positioned sunlight every day. The problem is that juggling a separate outdoor camera and solar panel installation is tricky, especially if you\u2019re short on room. Eufy\u2019s 2K-resolution cam uses an integrated solar panel instead so you can find a spot where the top of the camera gets enough sunlight to keep it powered, keeping manual battery recharging minimal or unnecessary.\nThe SoloCam S320, which offers a 130-degree field of view, also has a 600-lumen spotlight, color night vision and motion detection with person recognition. Without sunlight, the battery lasts up to four months. You can control it with Alexa and Google Assistant.\nThe cam is also designed to work without any subscriptions or add-ons, but that also means it\u2019s limited to (AES128-encrypted) 8GB of onboard storage. Eufy says that\u2019s enough for about two months of footage, but in my experience that can fill up quickly if your cam is recording multiple detections a day.\nWho is this for:\nPeople who don't want to worry about battery life and users who want to dodge subscription fees.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nUsers who plan on storing a lot of video with frequent activations, people who don't have the room or patience to manage a solar panel add-on installation.\nPros\n- Adjustable and customizable LED floodlights\n- Person and vehicle detection\n- 2K resolution\n- No subscription needed for onboard video storage\nCons\n- MicroSD card may need to be upgraded for larger video storage\n- Without an existing junction box, installation may be expensive\nWhy I like it:\nI've tested many floodlight cameras that I like, from the Nest Cam with floodlights that works so well with my Google Home app to the Arlo 2K wired floodlight model, which does a little of everything even if it needs a subscription to really shine. But ultimately I'm recommending this Lorex model for its combo of strong features and non-subscription model.\nFor example, the 2K resolution is excellent for a floodlight cam, which tends to overlook a large space and benefits from as many pixels as possible. It pairs well with Lorex\u2019s person-oriented motion detection, and the compatibility with Alexa and Google Home means you can use voice commands and smart displays for lots of added functionality. If the cam is close enough you can activate two-way audio and the adjustable floodlights include not only four different light scheduling options but the ability to set brightness and color temperature, something traditional floodlights just can\u2019t do.\nLorex avoids subscription fees, instead offering a pre-installed 32GB microSD chip, which cuts costs and helps secure privacy but you may need to get the ladder out when that card fills up.\nWho is this for:\nBuyers looking for a highly adaptable floodlight camera that focuses on onboard storage with no extra fees.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nUsers who like the versatility of cloud storage or prefer a brand that works more directly with their preferred app, like the Nest floodlight cam and Google Home.\nOutdoor home security cameras compared\n| Best Outdoor Cameras | Arlo Pro 5S 2K | TP-Link Tapo C310 | Arlo Go 2 | Ring Spotlight Cam Pro | Blink Outdoor 4 | Lorex 2K Floodlight Camera | Google Nest Indoor/Outdoor Cam (2nd-gen) | Lorex Fusion 2K | Eufy SoloCam S320 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Price | $120 | $35 | $200 | $230 | $100 | $280 | $165 | $220 | $130 |\n| Resolution | 2K | 2K | 1080p/HD | 1080p/HD | 1080p/HD | 2K | 1080p/HD | 2K | 2K |\n| Field of view | 160-degree, 12x digital zoom | 130-degrees | 130-degrees | 140-degrees | 143-degrees | 122-degrees, digital zoom | 130-degrees, 6x digital zoom | 360-degree panning, 12x optical zoom, 16x digital zoom | 130-degrees |\n| Power source | Battery | Wired | Battery | Battery | Battery | Wired | Battery | Wired | Battery with built-in solar panel |\n| Lighting | Spotlight | N/A | Spotlight | Spotlight | N/A | Adjustable floodlights | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Motion detection | Yes | Person detection | Yes | Advanced motion detection with motion zones | Enhanced motion detection | Smart motion detection | Yes | N/A | Person detection |\n| Audio | Two-way audio | Two-way audio | Two-way audio | Two-way audio | Two-way audio | Two-way audio | Two-way audio | N/A | Two-way audio |\n| Storage options | Subscription or separate hub | Subscription or local storage | Subscription or local storage | Subscription only | Subscription or separate hub | Local storage with include microSD card | 3 free hours of video storage, subscription to expand | Recorder required | Local, built-in storage |\n| Voice assistant | Alexa, Google Home, SmartThings | Alexa, Google Home | Alexa, Google Home | Alexa | Alexa | Alexa, Google Home | Alexa, Google Home | N/A | Alexa, Google Home |\n| Review score | N/A | N/A | N/A | 8.3 (earlier model) | 7.1 (earlier model) | N/A | 7.4 (Floodlight model) | N/A | N/A |\nFactors to consider when buying an outdoor security camera\nHow you power the camera\nOutdoor cameras need reliable power. Some users have no problems recharging a battery every several months, which typically takes about 6 hours connected to an adapter or simply leaving it overnight. Others may want to place cameras in positions where regular recharging is difficult. Wired versions of cameras skip this step but often require existing wiring in a junction box or some significant electrical work. Outdoor cameras with lights especially benefit from being wired, because lights are such a drain on battery life.\nThen there's PoE, or Power over Ethernet, which supplies an internet connection and power at the same time but requires a dedicated Ethernet line. These days, we're also seeing a growing number of solar outdoor cameras that offer a charging alternative, too.\nAll those choices come down to ease of use: We're looking for cams with reliable power options, excellent battery life, usable solar panels and other home-friendly aspects. The higher the camera is placed and the more power it uses, the more a wired solution becomes important.\nDurability\nOutdoor cams must be weather-resistant and high-quality versions should be able to handle low temperatures as well. Look for IP ratings, like IP65, which shows rain and dust resistance. If it gets cold in your area, look for cameras that are rated to operate well below freezing (most brands will give you a temperature operating range).\nVideo storage and security\nWhat do outdoor cameras do with the video they capture? The two primary choices are cloud storage through an internet connection and local storage through a hub or microSD card. Cloud storage is easy to capture and share but usually needs a subscription and raises privacy concerns when police can request video footage directly from companies.\nLocal storage is more private but can be harder to manage when storage starts getting full and needs to be culled. High-resolution video can fill up a small microSD card in a week or two if activations are frequent enough. Our list includes options for both, plus choices like the Nest Cam, which offers free cloud storage. If you're getting a microSD for local storage, we suggest getting a larger one, more than 100GB if possible.\nVideo encryption is also important to help secure video transfer and access. At this point, we would bring up the latest protocols like Matter and Thread, designed to make smart devices safer and more compatible with different platforms. While this compatibility can help many smart devices, Matter doesn't support video quite yet, so it won't apply to most of your data management here.\nResolution and field of view\nA security camera needs high-quality video and imaging to do its job well. The minimum these days is 1080p, and we're seeing a growing number of 2K and even 4K home security cameras available for greater detail. Don't go below HD-level if possible. Field of view, while less important, also helps a camera capture as large of an area as possible, which can be helpful when watching the entire front of a home or a whole backyard. About the best we've seen here is 160 degrees, but a 130-degree cam can still do well, especially if it's easy to angle.\nMotion detection and recognition\nMotion detection saves on video recordings and helps control adjacent features like spotlights and the important mobile alerts you can get on your phone. It's typically an automatic feature but made immensely better when a camera has AI recognition capabilities (preferably free). These help the camera ignore cars, leaves and possibly even animals in favor of humans, or let you choose alerts based on the subject matter. Together, the two features are a powerful mix.\nExtra features like two-way audio\nTwo-way audio can prove helpful if it's high-quality and the camera is close enough to people to be intelligible. Lighting is a very useful feature on any outdoor camera, which is why about half of our list includes lighting of some kind (and all have night vision).\nSolar power\nMost security companies now offer solar panels that you can connect to outdoor cameras. They help keep batteries recharged and if you get a lot of sun you may not have to worry about battery life for years. See if this addition makes sense for your home: While the panels can be easily angled, they will take up more space and require separate mounts.\nOther outdoor security cameras we tested\nWe've tested dozens of the most popular cameras from the biggest brands, including Google Nest, Amazon Blink, Amazon Ring, Wyze, Arlo, Eufy, Canary and more. If you're wondering why some cams made it on our current list and others didn't, it's important to note we're always watching the latest updates on features, subscriptions, privacy and new models to keep our picks current. Outdoor cams we tested that didn't quite make the list this time include:\nArlo Pro 3 Floodlight: If you're looking for a floodlight cam, this is a very strong option. We found the adjustable LED panels on the Lorex model more useful, and as we noted, a wired version is often better for power-hungry floodlights. Still, this model reviewed very well and made it onto our list of the best home security cams with lights.\nWyze Outdoor Cam v2: Wyze remains a strong choice for budget security cameras but Wyze continues to run into security and privacy concerns, from data breaches in recent years to video caching issues that let strangers see through each other's Wyze cams in 2023 and other breaches in 2024. We aren't going to recommend this cam until we're sure all security issues have been cleared up.\nNest Cam with Floodlight: The Nest Cam does have a version with floodlights but at $279 it's expensive for what you get. We preferred other floodlight options, although the Nest version could be an alternative if you really want free cloud storage and Google's AI detection.\nRing Stick Up Cam: While weather-resistant, we found the Ring Stick Up Cam slightly too fragile compared to our final picks. It's best used as an indoor/outdoor cam that you can move between places at will or find a sheltered spot under a patio to mount.\nEufy EufyCam S221(Update: Currently unavailable) The S221 is a high-quality camera model with some potential for outside use, but we disliked how a separate HomeBase 2 was absolutely required to use it, liking the versatility that Eufy's solar cam provided instead.\nHow we test home security cameras\nWe\u2019ve spent half a dozen years testing security cams, and developed a battery of tests and trials to determine exactly what outdoor cameras can do.\nSetup and installation\nAs we set up cameras, we watch for how easy it is for a newcomer to understand, what mounting options are present and how easy the camera is to set to the right angle. We also look at the software side of things, like how difficult it is to set up an account and how good the walkthroughs are.\nAfter installation, we like to run cameras for at least a week and preferably a month so that we can see how they perform over time, how quickly the battery goes down and if any errors creep into their objection detection.\nVideo quality and audio performance\nVideo and live view clarity are especially important for outdoor cameras so we test them in multiple conditions in backyards or testing facilities. We also experiment with night vision and how many yards it reaches. The details are important here, such as delays and latency in showing live views.\nThis is also an excellent time to test out audio functions and how clear audio is at 10 or 20 feet, especially in real-world conditions like a windy day.\nMotion detection, alerts and AI\nSecurity cameras have advanced features that we test with various scenarios, from delivering and \"stealing\" a package to walking a dog. That's when we see if motion detection and AI object recognition are accurate, timely and and work consistently over time. We adjust motion sensitivity and motion windows to test their accuracy as well.\nApp performance and UI\nIf you buy a security camera, you'll spend a lot of time in its app, at least on setup and probably very frequently afterward for live views and alert controls. So we check out the app thoroughly, including how easy it is to navigate, how simple the menus are to learn and if the app is cluttered or provides everything you want in a speedy layout.\nIf you want to read more about our review process, check out our in-depth article on how we test home security cameras and video doorbells.\nRecent updates\nSpring 2025: We exchanged the Lorex Fusion for a Lorex Floodlight model, because we really wanted to include a floodlight version for this list. While we like the Nest floodlight it's quite expensive and Lorex offers local cloud storage plus highly customizable LED panels that make it a strong lighting choice.\nOutdoor security camera FAQ\nOutdoor security cameras can be used for various purposes and your particular needs will determine which one is best. If you're looking for minimal upkeep, an outdoor camera with a power cord might be the best bet, whereas monitoring spaces far from a power outlet could make a battery-powered device a better option. In general, outdoor cameras with at least 1080p resolution, a wide field of view, night vision and deterrence features like a spotlight or alarm will serve you well.\n\",\"quickTake\":\"\",\"canCollapse\":\"true\",\"collapseOnPageLoad\":\"false\",\"canTruncate\":\"true\",\"truncateOnPageLoad\":\"false\"},{\"question\":\"What are the privacy and security considerations for outdoor cameras?\",\"answer\":\"If you're privacy conscious, then your best bet is to shop for security cameras that let you store the footage locally, usually on a microSD card or some other means of storage on the device itself. Once you start uploading your video for storage on a company's servers, that footage is subject to the company's policies regarding storing and sharing it.\nOn the security front, the best way to keep your footage safe from unauthorized access or hacks is to make sure that you're using two-factor authentication, which greatly reduces the odds that anyone can access your account without your knowledge. If you're uploading footage to a company's servers, you'll want to make sure that the footage is encrypted along the way.\nThe most secure approach is end-to-end encryption, or E2EE, which means nobody can access your footage without a unique decryption key associated with your device. With E2EE, even the company you're storing the footage with shouldn't be able to access your clips. \\\"Encryption in transit\\\" and \\\"encryption at rest\\\" are good standards as well but they wouldn't necessarily prevent the company you're storing footage with from being able to access your clips.\nOne more thing: It should go without saying but these outdoor cameras are meant to keep an eye on your own home and property. Set one up someplace where you don't have permission or where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy and you \"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"\\\" data-id=\\\"739f1084-e67f-4e22-b590-5500eeecf60c\\\" href=\\\"https://www.safewise.com/security-camera-laws/\\\">could run afoul of the law.\n\",\"quickTake\":\"\",\"canCollapse\":\"true\",\"collapseOnPageLoad\":\"false\",\"canTruncate\":\"true\",\"truncateOnPageLoad\":\"false\"},{\"question\":\"What is the best security camera for cold weather?\",\"answer\":\"Whether you're worried about extreme cold, rain or any other inclement weather, you'll want to be sure to check your camera's IP rating and lowest operating temperature. IP ratings of 65 or 66 are solid; you won't get dust into the outdoor camera or water unless submerged.\nGenerally, you'll also want to compare your regional winter temperatures to your camera's lowest operating temperature. Battery-operated cameras usually need warmer temperatures. The Google Nest Cam may start running into trouble as temperatures go below 32 degrees Fahrenheit regularly, while our top Arlo pick can work at minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\",\"quickTake\":\"\",\"canCollapse\":\"true\",\"collapseOnPageLoad\":\"false\",\"canTruncate\":\"true\",\"truncateOnPageLoad\":\"false\"},{\"question\":\"What do I do if my outdoor camera records a crime?\",\"answer\":\"If you believe your outdoor camera has recorded footage of a crime, first download or transfer that footage as a shareable video file on your computer so you don\u2019t have to worry about it disappearing. Then look up your local police website and see if they can file a police report online. Most do and you will usually have an opportunity to attach your video footage. Those steps are important for legal and insurance purposes.\nIf you want to pursue the incident, we suggest you immediately call the police afterward and explain your situation, clearly stating that you have evidence and are interested in taking further steps. If you aren\u2019t seeing the desired results from your conversations, consider consulting with a criminal attorney or similar legal expert.\n\",\"quickTake\":\"\",\"canCollapse\":\"true\",\"collapseOnPageLoad\":\"false\",\"canTruncate\":\"true\",\"truncateOnPageLoad\":\"false\"},{\"question\":\"Do standard outdoor security cameras have night vision?\",\"answer\":\"Yes, all outdoor security cameras should have some capability to let you see and record at night time, but some of them have extra night vision features. For example, the Arlo Pro 5S 2K has color night vision that can enhance the scene of dark environments. The TP-Link Tapo C310 also has night vision reaching 98 feet. If you're looking for specific night vision features, double-check the model you're considering to make sure it has what you want.\n\",\"quickTake\":\"\",\"canCollapse\":\"true\",\"collapseOnPageLoad\":\"false\",\"canTruncate\":\"true\",\"truncateOnPageLoad\":\"false\"},{\"question\":\"How long do outdoor security camera batteries last?\",\"answer\":\"Battery life varies based on many factors, most notably activations or every time it turns on to record sensed motion. If that happens 12 to 20 times a day, a battery can quickly drain over a few weeks. For normal activations, most batteries last several months or so. There are also outliers, like the Blink Outdoor 4.
