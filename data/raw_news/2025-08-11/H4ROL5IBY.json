  "description": "PRINCE Harry and Meghan Markle signed for their latest Netflix deal for \u201cmuch less\u201d than previously as they no longer in a strong position, a royal expert has said. The couple announced\u2026",
  "content": "PRINCE Harry and Meghan Markle signed for their latest Netflix deal for \"much less\" than previously as they no longer in a strong position, a royal expert has said.\n\nThe couple announced today they had signed a new \"multi-year, first look deal\" with the American streaming giant to produce \"film and television projects\".\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have previously released a number of shows on the platform, including a 2022 documentary on their lives and Meghan's lifestyle show With Love, Meghan this year.\n\nThey had secured a lucrative five-year contract - thought to be worth more than $100 million (\u00a374 million) - with Netflix after quitting as senior working royals in 2020.\n\nHowever, this new deal has been signed for \"much less\", an insider told Page Six.\n\nAdding to this, Royal Biographer Hugo Vickers told The Sun the couple were \"not in a strong bargaining position\" when agreeing to the new partnership with Netflix.\n\nHe added that Netflix signed the deal due to the \"publicity\" the company would get from showcasing the royals on its platform.\n\nHugo said: \"I don't think the Sussexes would have been able to pressurise them [Netflix] because they're not in a very strong bargaining position.\n\n\"Netflix will have figured out they will be getting publicity from the shows.\"\n\nThis weakened position could have led to a cheaper deal being signed as well as the introduction of a \"first look\" clause in the agreement.\n\nIt means Netflix will only pay for projects they want to screen, rather than pay in a single multi-million pound agreement like the one signed in 2020, The Sun understands.\n\nThe Sun can also reveal, however, that the streaming giants will cover Archewell Productions's overheads, including all costs for its offices and staff.\n\nNetflix will also have to fork out to the couple to have the exclusive first look on their projects.\n\nIt is not yet known how much the new extended deal will bring in for the couple, or how long it will last.\n\nMeghan said in a statement today: \"We're proud to extend our partnership with Netflix and expand our work together to include the As Ever brand.\n\n\"My husband and I feel inspired by our partners who work closely with us and our Archewell Productions team to create thoughtful content across genres that resonates globally, and celebrates our shared vision.\"\n\nOn top of Season 2 of With Love, Meghan - which will drop later this month - the couple will also film a \"Holiday Celebration\" Christmas special this December.\n\n\"Join Meghan in Montecito for a magical holiday celebration,\" the announcement read.\n\n\"Together, friends and family deck the halls, create holiday feasts, craft heartfelt gifts, and share lots of laughs \u2013 with simple how-tos to follow at home. It's a holiday wonder with warmth, tradition, and a generous dose of joy.\"\n\nThe couple will also release a short film called \"Masaka Kids, A Rhythm Within\" which will look at Uganda\u2019s Masaka region and the HIV/AIDS crisis there.\n\nThis has echoes of Harry's mum Diana's work, who pioneered social change on perceptions of HIV/AIDS.\n\nIn 1987, Princess Diana opened the UK's first purpose built HIV/AIDS unit at Middlesex Hospital in London.\n\nShe famously shook the hand of a man suffering with the illness without gloves, publicly challenging the idea that HIV/AIDS was passed from person to person by touch.\n\n'Meghan & Harry need to come up with a hit soon' JUST when you thought it was safe to turn the telly on again... Harry and Meghan are back. And their multi-year renewal with Netflix means they are not going away anytime soon. There have been tense negotiations in recent weeks but Netflix is so deeply involved with Meghan's As Ever brand it was always likely that the streaming giants would want them back. Make no mistake, Harry and Meghan would have been desperate for the deal to be renewed. They will likely be opening a bottle or two of As Ever Rose in Montecito. Because they have invested heavily in Archewell Productions and getting on board with Netflix is central not only to their post-Royal endeavours but more importantly crucial to their bank accounts. If they lost their Netflix money then how could they afford their life in the US? While the length of the deal or how much the couple are getting paid is vague we do know that Meghan will appear in a 'holiday special' in December that will likely clash with the Princess of Wales's annual Christmas carol concert at Westminster Abbey. And finally, two years after I revealed in The Sun the couple had bought the rights to the book Meet Me At The Lake, production is in active development. Sources close to the couple are coy about whether Harry or Meghan will appear on screen for the production of Masaka Kids, A Rhythm Within which will air later this year. But perhaps the best piece of news from the announcement is no repeat of the six-part documentary which dumped on the Royal Family. However, 'Harry & Meghan' was a ratings dream and none of their projects since have been anywhere as successful. They need to come up with a hit soon. And this 'first look' deal means Netflix has the first option on new projects from the couple without any guaranteed commitment. But remember the Sussexes are not the only Royals to be in bed with Netflix. The King will feature in a documentary on The King's Foundation with Idris Elba.\n\nThere is also \"active development\" on other projects with Netflix which \"span a variety of content genres\", including a feature adaptation of the bestselling romantic novel by Carley Fortune, Meet Me At The Lake.\n\nBela Bajaria, Netflix\u2019s Chief Content Officer, said: \u201cHarry and Meghan are influential voices whose stories resonate with audiences everywhere.\n\n\"The response to their work speaks for itself \u2014 Harry & Meghan gave viewers an intimate look into their lives and quickly became one of our most-watched documentary series.\n\n\"More recently, fans have been inspired by With Love, Meghan, with products from the new As Ever line consistently selling out in record time.\n\n\"We\u2019re excited to continue our partnership with Archewell Productions and to entertain our members together.\u201d\n\nThe Sun has reached out to the Sussexes for comment.",

      "text": "Why Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s new Netflix deal is another humiliating blow for much-maligned royal exiles\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle are extending their Netflix partnership, but we hear their new contract is \u201cmuch\u201d less than their previous \u201c$100 million deal\u201d with the streaming company.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not much,\u201d an insider told Page Six on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s no risk for Netflix but saves them both reputationally.\u201d\nReps for the couple did not immediately respond to Page Six\u2019s requests for comment.\nHarry and Markle\u2019s company, Archewell Productions, and Netflix announced Monday that the couple agreed to a new first-look deal ahead of their current contract ending in September.\nUnder the new deal, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will still have to run their ideas by Netflix. From there, the streaming service will decide whether it wants to obtain project rights to the duo\u2019s pitches.\nViewers can expect to see an expansion of Markle\u2019s lifestyle brand, As Ever, grow on the big screen. Season 2 of her Netflix series, \u201cWith Love, Meghan,\u201d is set to be released in late August, a press release obtained by Page Six Monday revealed.\nThe \u201cSuits\u201d alum will also be releasing a special \u201cWith Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration\u201d episode in December, featuring \u201choliday wonder with warmth, tradition, and a generous dose of joy\u201d with \u201cfriends and family.\u201d\nLater this year, a short documentary \u2014 titled \u201cMasaka Kids, A Rhythm Within\u201d and produced by Markle and Harry \u2014 will also be released, highlighting a small orphanage in Uganda, where \u201cchildren transform hardship into joy, dancing their way toward healing, belonging, and the promise of a brighter future.\u201d\nOther Archewell Productions projects in development with Netflix include an adaptation of Carley Fortune\u2019s book, \u201cMeet Me at the Lake.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to extend our partnership with Netflix and expand our work together to include the As ever brand,\u201d the actress wrote in a statement obtained by Page Six.\n\u201cMy husband and I feel inspired by our partners who work closely with us and our Archewell Productions team to create thoughtful content across genres that resonates globally, and celebrates our shared vision.\u201d\nIn a separate statement, Netflix\u2019s Chief Content Officer, Bela Bajaria, said that the company looks forward to being able to \u201centertain [their] members together.\u201d\n\u201cHarry and Meghan are influential voices whose stories resonate with audiences everywhere,\u201d the businesswoman wrote, referring to the couple\u2019s 2022 \u201cHarry & Meghan\u201d series, which \u201cgave viewers an intimate look into their lives and quickly became one of [Netflix\u2019s] most-watched documentary series.\u201d\n\u201cMore recently, fans have been inspired by \u2018With Love, Meghan,\u2019 with products from the new As Ever line consistently selling out in record time.\u201d\nLast month, Page Six exclusively reported that Harry and Meghan were continuing their partnership with Netflix.
