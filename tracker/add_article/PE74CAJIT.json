      "summary": "The S&P 500 rose 0.51%, the Nasdaq 100 gained 0.79%, while the Dow slipped 0.05%, as investors priced in a higher probability of a Fed rate cut after weaker labor market data and falling 10‑year Treasury yields. Megacap tech names such as Alphabet and Apple added momentum, whereas energy stocks lagged on a 2% drop in WTI crude. Fed officials, including Waller, Musalem and Bostic, signaled that cuts could begin next month, with futures markets pricing a 95% chance of a 25‑bp cut at the September FOMC. The broader market also benefited from lower term premiums and a modest decline in the U.S. dollar index, while European indices posted mixed results amid softer euro‑zone PMI and commodity price swings.",
