  "description": "At a crucial juncture of the match, the British No 1 had to keep her focus amid an unusual crowd disturbance",
  "content": "Emma Raducanu took issue with a crying baby during her three-hour epic against world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka at the Cincinnati Open.\n\nIn a chaotic eighth game of the deciding final set, as the match ebbed and flowed in every direction, Raducanu was distracted by a baby as she struggled to hold serve.\n\nFresh off their third-round clash at Wimbledon last month, Sabalenka and Raducanu produced another fine contest, featuring a 13-deuce game in the third set, before the 27-year-old Belarusian sealed victory in three hours and nine minutes.\n\nTelegraph Sport takes you through some of those key moments ...\n\nRaducanu, who served impressively all match, moved to 40-15 when she hit a first serve down the T and finished off the short return with a backhand winner.\n\nLittle did we know that this would be the start of a titanic service game.\n\nSabalenka keeps herself in the game and makes it deuce. She earns her first break point when Raducanu slices a backhand into the net.\n\nRaducanu responds to that error with a first serve ace down the T. Clutch play at a critical time.\n\nRaducanu and crowd want baby removed from stadium\n\nAfter squandering her sixth opportunity to hold serve, Raducanu goes to the back of the court and says: \u201cIt\u2019s been like 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nUmpire: \u201cIt\u2019s a child. Do you want me to send the child out of the stadium?\u201d\n\nRaducanu doesn\u2019t even have to reply because the spectators around her do so, saying \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nRaducanu smiles, wipes her shoulder with a towel and prepares to go again.\n\nWhy a baby is at a tennis match is another question ...",
