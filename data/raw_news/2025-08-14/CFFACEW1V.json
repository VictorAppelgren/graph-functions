The updated earnings release reads:\n\nAmaze Reports Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results with 1,134% Year-Over-Year Revenue Growth\n\nWith Q2 Revenue Baseline, Company Expects Sequential Topline Growth for Remainder of 2025\n\nNEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Aug. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amaze Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: AMZE) (\u201cAmaze\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a global leader in creator-powered commerce, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\u2022 Surpassed 200 million lifetime storefront visits and 12 million active creators, underscoring the Amaze platform\u2019s scale and influence in the rapidly expanding creator economy.\n\u2022 Announced several marquee partnerships in recent weeks, including Alex Caruso, Jamvana, Loaded Dice, Nutrius, and Ghost Gaming, among others.\n\u2022 Partnered with Picsart, allowing users to turn their digital art, edits, and designs into physical products such as hoodies, stickers, and tote bags to sell.\n\u2022 Began beta testing program for Amaze Digital Fits, a web-based tool will enable Roblox creators to design avatar fashion with no 3D experience required.\n\u2022 Partnered with VisitIQ allowing Amaze to analyze, visualize, and activate first-party fan and creator data across its fast-growing platform, enabling Amaze to turn deep audience insights into smarter marketing, more comprehensive creator support, and product innovation.\n\u2022 Launched digital payment strategy designed to modernize global payments, unlock new monetization tools, and enhance financial flexibility, emphasizing Amaze\u2019s assertive push to lead in payment innovation.\n\u2022 Formed strategic partnership with Parler, enabling creators to sell products directly through Parler\u2019s growing network of social media properties including PlayTV and Parler.com.\n\n\n\nManagement Commentary\n\n\u201cIn our first full quarter as a public company, we took important steps to position Amaze for long-term success,\u201d said Aaron Day, CEO of Amaze. \u201cTo solidify our position as the go-to platform for creators, we launched new integrations like Express Checkout and AI-driven selling tools, and we also expanded monetization opportunities to Roblox players and Picsart users. These innovations helped us surpass 200 million storefront visits and over 12 million active creators on the platform.\n\n\u201cFinancially, we generated $0.87 million in net revenue this quarter, which we view as a strong baseline for future growth. Over the past several quarters, we\u2019ve devoted significant time and effort to recapitalize the business and retool our technology infrastructure. With both initiatives far along, we now have improved liquidity to strategically invest in our business, which we expect to lead to accelerating topline growth and improved KPI performance through the second half of the year.\u201d\n\u2022 U.S. Conversion Rate: .41% of all traffic\n\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Results\n\nResults compare the second quarter ended June 30, 2025 (\u201cQ2 2025\u201d) to the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 (\u201cQ2 2024\u201d) unless otherwise indicated. Results from Q2 2024 represent only Fresh Vine Wine, Inc. results.\n\u2022 Total revenue increased 1,134% to $0.87 million in Q2 2025 from $0.07 million in the same year-ago period. The increase in net contribution revenue was mostly attributable to the addition of sales from Amaze as the Company closed the acquisition during the first quarter of 2025.\n\u2022 Gross profit increased 1,903% to $0.79 million in Q2 2025 from $(0.04) million in the same year-ago period. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to the operating leverage of the Amaze platform, which enables high-margin digital and physical sales with lower incremental cost compared to traditional wholesale models.\n\u2022 Net loss was $5.0 million, or $(3.14) per share, in Q2 2025 compared to net loss of $0.88 million, or $(1.30) per share, in the same year-ago period. The increase in net loss is largely driven by a $4.0 million increase in SG&A expenses that are primarily related to operating costs associated with Amaze\u2019s creator-focused business model, including personnel, legal and professional services related to the reverse merger, and marketing costs to support platform growth.\n\u2022 The Company had $0.31 million in cash at June 30, 2025, compared to $0.16 million at December 31, 2024.\n\nOutlook\n\nAmaze management expects to build on the base provided by its Q2 performance, both at the top and bottom line. The Company foresees net revenue continuing to ramp sequentially in Q3 as well as into Q4. As a result of these material topline increases, combined with additional organizational efficiencies, Amaze also expects to generate a temporary profit in Q4 2025/Q1 2026 due to an increase in sales related to the seasonality of the business.\n\nAmaze\u2019s Q3 2025, Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 financial outlook is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside our control. If actual results vary from these assumptions, our expectations may change. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these results.\n\nShareholder Letter\n\nAmaze management also posted a letter to shareholders on its Investor Relations website (ir.amaze.co), which further details the company\u2019s results, discusses various business initiatives, and provides a future financial and industry outlook.\n\nFor investor information, please contact IR@amaze.co\n\nFor press inquiries, please contact PR@amaze.co\n\nAvailable Information\n\nWe periodically provide other information for investors on our corporate website, https://www.amaze.co, and our investor relations website, https://ir.amaze.co.
