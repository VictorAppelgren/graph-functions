      "feedback": "The analysis draft presents a solid overview of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it can be enhanced to achieve world-class quality. To improve depth and clarity, explicitly articulate the causal relationships between inflation, labor market dynamics, and Fed policy decisions, ensuring a coherent causal chain. Incorporate specific quantitative data, such as the expected impact of tariffs on inflation rates, to ground your assertions in first principles. Additionally, refine the scenario structure by clearly delineating potential outcomes based on different inflation and employment trajectories, and specify catalysts that could trigger shifts in market sentiment or Fed policy. Ensure that all sources are correctly cited, with a focus on critical data points that support your arguments. Lastly, conclude with a more definitive base case and key risks, while maintaining a concise format that adheres to length constraints.",
