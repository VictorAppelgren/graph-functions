  "content": "Happy Birthday: Listen, observe and launch a spontaneous move to combat anything that doesn\u2019t sit right with you or your plans. Your mission is to take control and responsibility for your choices and the results. Refuse to let others fill your dance card for you. Say no to inappropriate demands to ensure you have the time to attend to your essential needs and desires. It\u2019s OK to put yourself first. Your numbers are 4, 11, 22, 26, 31, 39, 42.\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Allocate your dollars to something that contributes to personal growth, accumulation and connecting with people who can broaden your outlook regarding how to make your money stretch or work harder for you. A kind or romantic gesture can lead to a sense of responsibility and security, helping you put your life and prospects into perspective. 3 stars\n\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Refuse to get caught up in someone\u2019s drama. Spare yourself grief, save your reputation and maintain your position. Getting upset or angry will only make matters worse, so distance yourself and do something that brings value to your life instead of pain or regret. Focus your energy on building wealth and fostering a healthy lifestyle. 3 stars\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Live, learn and experience pastimes that help you grow emotionally. Let your physical needs come front and center, and put your intellectual beliefs on the back burner to avoid an altercation with someone who doesn\u2019t feel the same as you. Everyone has a right to freedom of thought. Be the best you can be. 3 stars\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Tidy up loose ends first, and you\u2019ll experience an attitude shift that will enhance your day. Mix business with pleasure, network and socialize, and you\u2019ll gain insight into lifestyle options that interest you. A commitment to someone special will lead to plans that require a budget and research. Romance is in the stars. 4 stars\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Gauge your time and the requests others make, and refrain from taking on too much. Someone will take advantage of you or try to take ownership of something that belongs to you. Create opportunities and follow through with your plans in secret to protect yourself and what\u2019s rightfully yours. Make health a priority. 2 stars\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): You\u2019re on the path to growth and gain. Review your options, set a budget and be relentless in your quest to excel. Your intelligence is heightened, and your desire to succeed will give you the stamina necessary to defeat anything or anyone who gets in your way. Personal and professional improvements are within reach. 5 stars\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Expand your interests, friendships and knowledge through networking events, and you\u2019ll discover new outlets for your skills and experience. Recognize when someone is jealous or uses emotional manipulation to hold you back. Sometimes, the ones you least expect are the ones you must watch out for most. Keep your eyes open and protect your secrets. 3 stars\n\nARIES (March 21-April 19): Draw on your resources for facts and solutions. A shift in how you invest and earn a living is apparent. An unexpected event will turn into a blessing in disguise. Partnerships, networking and personal gains are on the rise. Don\u2019t overreact to domestic situations; morph into fix-it mode, and put whatever is holding you back behind you. 3 stars\n\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): Look for the good in everyone and everything. A pessimistic or stubborn approach will lead to trouble. Control situations using a positive attitude, and you\u2019ll gain support and make a difference. Life is about more than perfection or always getting your way. Establish your position, but don\u2019t force your will, and something good will unfold. 3 stars\n\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): Set yourself up for success. Mingle, network and market yourself by offering your skills and experience to those you want or need to impress. Talk the talk and walk the walk, and something good will transpire. Personal growth, domestic improvements and unique experiences will foster stronger partnerships. Explore and express your thoughts. 5 stars\n\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): Lead without force. Capturing the attention of those already on your team will help you build a solid foundation. A creative approach to handling money, budgeting and getting along with others will be directly linked to how well you will do. Invest more in yourself, your skills and your dreams. Fitness and health are favored. 4 stars\n\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Draw on your resources and forge ahead with confidence. You have plenty to gain if you are open to suggestions, use your creativity to expand your interests, and welcome suggestions, changes and contributions from those who want to be part of your plans. Love is favored, and meeting people who share your interests is likely. 3 stars\n\nBirthday Baby: You are curious, diligent and outspoken. You are persistent and imaginative.\n\n1 star: Avoid conflicts; work behind the scenes. 2 stars: You can accomplish, but don\u2019t rely on others. 3 stars: Focus and you\u2019ll reach your goals. 4 stars: Aim high; start new projects. 5 stars: Nothing can stop you; go for gold.",

      "text": "DEAR ANNIE: My 23-year-old son graduated from college two years ago and has been unemployed ever since. He earned a degree in a competitive field but has not had any luck landing a job in his chosen profession. While we understand that finding the right opportunity can take time, we are growing increasingly concerned.\nHe refuses to consider any kind of job outside of his intended career path, insisting that if he takes something \u201cbeneath him,\u201d he will get stuck and never leave. We have tried reasoning with him, encouraging him to gain experience, even if it is unrelated, to avoid having a completely blank resume. We have offered suggestions, networking opportunities and moral support, but he will not budge.\nHe still lives at home, which we do not mind, within reason, but the money he saved while working part time in college is running out fast. It is frustrating to watch him stagnate while the months go by. He says he is waiting for the \u201cright fit,\u201d but we worry he is letting pride or fear hold him back.\nHow do we help him see that some kind of work, any work, is better than no work at all? And how do we support him without enabling this pattern? I admire your insight and would truly appreciate any words of wisdom for both him and us. -- Worried Parents in Limbo\nDEAR WORRIED: You are right to be concerned. A two-year gap on a resume, especially in those early post-grad years, can be hard to explain later. While it is admirable that your son wants to pursue work in his chosen field, his refusal to take any job in the meantime is shortsighted and, frankly, self-sabotaging.\nWork is more than a title. It teaches discipline, builds character and often leads to unexpected opportunities. No one\u2019s first job out of college defines their entire future. What does shape the future is sitting at home waiting for perfection. That is not strategy; it is fear wearing a mask of pride.\nLet your son know that while you love him, the time for passivity has passed. He needs to contribute, either by working, volunteering, interning or even pursuing additional training. And if his savings are dwindling, it may be time to start charging rent -- not as punishment, but to nudge him toward reality.\nSometimes, the most loving thing a parent can do is stop cushioning the fall.\nSend your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.\nLatest Advice Columns\n- Today\u2019s daily horoscope for Aug. 25, 2025\n- Asking Eric: I knew our friendship would change once she married, but I never thought it would be so drastic\n- Dear Abby: My neighbors invited my husband to dinner, but excluded me\n- I was promised massive energy bill savings.

      "text": "DEAR ERIC: My best friend and I, both females and in our 60s, used to do everything together. Last year, she met a nice man and after a brief courtship, they married. I even performed the wedding ceremony.\nNow, we barely see each other, and maybe text or call once a week, if that.\nI knew and understood that our friendship was going to change once she married and I expected that, but I never thought it would be so drastic. Her husband gets upset if she wants \u201cgirl time\u201d with me and even other friends. I feel really hurt and discarded. I\u2019m not sure if I should talk to her about it or leave it be. I don\u2019t want to cause a rift between us or make it awkward.\n\u2013 Fractured Friendship\nDEAR FRIENDSHIP: Talk to her. Her new husband\u2019s behavior is concerning and controlling. Isolation is a form of emotional abuse, and it can escalate and put her in danger. He shouldn\u2019t have a negative emotional response to her spending time with friends, particularly her best friend. She (and you) can find resources at the National Domestic Violence Hotline (TheHotline.org). But help can start with a conversation between you and her that\u2019s rooted in your love for her and your desire to see her healthy and happy.\nIt may be helpful to enlist other friends, as well. You don\u2019t want to gang up on her, but you can ask them if they\u2019re seeing the same things you\u2019re seeing. If she hears this perspective from multiple people, it may take root more effectively. As you go about this, try to put your hurt to the side for the moment. There will be time to address it, but first you\u2019ll want to make sure she sees the issues in her relationship clearly.\n(Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O.

      "text": "IF TODAY IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: The end of August could become a highly significant time; a new opportunity could be game-changing if everything checks out. Resources needed should all be present. September is a time to apply both boots-on-the-ground effort and high-level logic to anything you are dealing with\u2014you should have easy access to both. Avoid October for any important dealings or first meetings, but it could be a great month for a low-key getaway\u2014save higher-octane adventures for a month with safer, more supportive stars. November could offer warm and cozy times at home but also pay attention to intuitive hits at that time. December could be a time to shine, though most should be appreciative, there could be someone who doesn\u2019t get it. The new year should start strong.\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Don\u2019t let a career or other worldly concern destroy your day or your sleep. Worries should settle down very soon and helpful changes could already be afoot. It could be time to break out and let your light shine.\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): It\u2019s not a good time to consider or adjust your budget or investments, your own perspective might not be 100% accurate, and there could be little outside support. Keep messaging with friends mellow and low-key.\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): A concern about a joint or shared venture could be troubling but may be resolved soon. Adjust your expectations of a relationship, they may just not have much to give now. Share bounty with friends; build networks of reciprocity.\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Bring your concerns to a partner, they could be simpler to resolve than you may think. A day trip could offer both fun and some interesting takeaways. It could be somewhat challenging to get basic daily tasks completed to your satisfaction.\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Show you care with real support and real efforts. Be a refuge for a partner or let them provide sanctuary for you. Developing your talents is a long game, while you\u2019re reaching some potentials there is always more attainment.\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Keep conversations in relationships mild and on point\u2014avoid getting extreme or reactive. Get out of your routines for a day if you can to switch things up and reinvigorate yourself. Express creatively for soul satisfaction.\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Clarity around finances could be tough to achieve now, but some active analysis could shed light. You may want to cocoon today to rest your heart and mind. Move past any anxieties and remind yourself of your many wins, large and small.\nARIES (March 21-April 19): Get some fresh air literally or figurately; you may be subconsciously craving a new perspective. A relationship conversation could be calm or agitated, put a pin in it if things get emotional and unproductive.\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): Old, unresolved business in your mind or heart can impact your day-to-day life more than you realize. Clear the old stuff with some intentional self-work to pave the way for fresh new beginnings. You should have the energy needed for completing tasks.\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): If you\u2019ve been looking for your yellow brick road, you could be close to finding it\u2014clues are in your lifelong passions and interests. You or a partner could have just the knowledge and insights the other needs.\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): Existential questions could be occupying your mind; ask the Universe for clarity and you might find that the answer drops in your lap. A tweak to your appearance you\u2019ve been considering could find its moment this week.\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Spend time with a bestie if you can\u2014you or they might have just the remedy for something worrying. Take on something active to release high energies. Creative inspo could flow strongly today, use it to get something started or completed.\nBIRTHDAY STAR: Actor Beth Riesgraf was born on this day in 1978 in Belle Plaine, Minnesota.

      "text": "DEAR ABBY: I\u2019ve been married more than 20 years. You read it correctly. This afternoon, my husband came home and told me our neighbors had invited him out to dinner to thank him for helping them with their yard work yesterday. Usually, I\u2019m at work in the afternoon, but today was my day off. When I asked him if I was included, he said, \u201cNo. Just me!\u201d I felt bad but didn\u2019t show it.\nMy husband came home a few hours later and began talking to our adult son about their evening as if I wasn\u2019t there. When I asked why he didn\u2019t tell them I was home and would\u2019ve come along, his response was, \u201cI KNEW you would somehow make it my fault that you didn\u2019t come!\u201d I told him it didn\u2019t look right that he was tagging along while his wife was left behind. Am I overreacting? -- MRS. LEFT OUT\nDEAR MRS. LEFT OUT: Your neighbors were wrong to invite your husband out and exclude you. But what happened after that makes me wonder if something more is wrong in your relationship with your husband. (\u201cI KNEW you would make it my fault,\u201d etc.) If this is a symptom of a larger problem, you and your husband should discuss it with the help of a marriage and family therapist. Your doctor or health insurance company can refer you.\n***\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.
