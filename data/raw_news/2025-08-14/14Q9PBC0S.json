  "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nResearchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have begun a series of experiments that could result in more energy for the grid by increasing nuclear fuel efficiency. The tests are made possible by the special delivery of 11 \"high burnup\" rods that were irradiated for research purposes.\n\nThe rods will be punctured, cut, mechanically stressed and closely examined\u2014all part of testing to learn how the metal alloys fared inside the extreme environment of a nuclear reactor for six years, where temperatures can soar to hundreds of degrees Celsius.\n\nThe larger aim: to understand how advanced fuels developed by Global Nuclear Fuel react to \"higher burnup\" conditions. Those conditions partly entail keeping the fuels inside a reactor for longer than is typical, with the goal of extracting more energy out of the fuel than is done today.\n\n\"To draw more energy from these materials and increase plant power is like putting new generating capacity on the grid without having to build any new infrastructure,\" said Mark Nutt, director of PNNL's nuclear energy market sector. \"That's a useful thing for both fuel vendors and a nation that seeks to realize a fuller nuclear potential.\"\n\nThe series of experiments underway at PNNL will reveal important information about how the research rods reacted to the conditions, and may even inform how future fuels are designed. High burnup fuels stand to boost the performance of the country's nuclear power fleet by making more efficient use of existing fuel materials, making reactors more resistant to nuclear incidents and perhaps even lowering the cost of electricity.\n\n\"This is a significant milestone for our Accident Tolerant Fuel program,\" said Frank Goldner, the Accident Tolerant Fuel federal program manager in the Office of Nuclear Energy. \"The development of this fuel could further support the Trump Administration's executive order to facilitate 5 gigawatts of power uprates at existing power plants by 2030 and high burnup fuels could be a big part of that.\"\n\nWhen the rods first arrived at the PNNL-Richland campus, many of the scientists watching the delivery wore expressions of anticipation. The shipping process was well-regulated, requiring complex logistical coordination between agencies over a span of 14 months. As an unloading crew meticulously transferred the 60,000-pound stainless-steel rod-carrying cask into the Radiochemical Processing Laboratory (RPL), a team of technicians, radiation chemists, material scientists and nuclear engineers was at the ready. Testing was to begin right away.\n\nAlmost like forensic analysis, signatures of past exposure imbued throughout the materials will answer important questions for curious scientists. Did the outer casing, called \"cladding,\" perform as expected under high burnup conditions? Researchers will search for changes in the material through \"tensile testing\" techniques. They'll also use a digital image correlation method to paint the cladding with thousands of dots, then trace the movement of those dots as the cladding is pulled apart with great mechanical force to gather significantly more data.\n\nIn one test, researchers used remotely operated manipulators inside a heavily shielded hot cell to puncture the cladding, releasing the rods' internal pressure. They then capture the radioactive gases that released, which reveal how much pressure built up inside the cladding as the rods' internal contents underwent fission reactions. All of these data will help Global Nuclear Fuel to further validate the models that estimate how their fuel may perform under various conditions.\n\n\"The examination of these rods is the next step in our continuous drive to develop higher efficiency fuels that are safer and more reliable,\" said Craig Ranson, Installed Base CEO, GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy. \"We are proud to be part of this collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy, PNNL and our utility partners to benefit the entire industry.\"\n\nIt's exactly the kind of post-irradiation examination that PNNL is poised to do, thanks in part to the uniqueness of the RPL, a hazard category II non-reactor nuclear research facility. Equipped with precision instruments and staffed by researchers and technicians with diverse expertise, it's rare that a single facility can perform such wide-ranging and specialized analyses for multiple sponsors.\n\n\"The RPL provides a unique opportunity where we can actually accept full-length high burnup rods, perform the research in the hot cells and take the material to different labs within the same space\u2014without having to transfer buildings\u2014for testing. It's very efficient,\" said PNNL chemist and project co-lead Susan Asmussen. \"We have the ability to do work on materials\u2014from post-irradiation examination to liquid-liquid separation chemistry\u2014that few other facilities have.\"\n\nCo-lead Brady Hanson, a nuclear engineer at PNNL, concurs, also citing the research team's breadth of experience as a key advantage.\n\n\"We can perform all the kinds of chemistry you could dream of under this roof, but we can also do mechanical and material testing here and we can quite literally get all the way down to the atomic level. There are few questions we can't answer,\" Hanson said.\n\n\"That's a feature of both our facility and our diverse research team. We've got nuclear, mechanical and chemical engineers, materials scientists and a chemist. It takes all of us to look at the scope of the work from different angles and provide different viewpoints, and I think that's what really makes us a strong team.\"\n\nPNNL also benefits from its extensive research scope and varied mission partners, as scientists from several disciplines work onsite and can collaborate on experiments to maximize the use of valuable nuclear materials for mission needs across the U.S. government. For instance, debris generated from the decladding process will be used to train the next generation of scientists tasked with developing technologies to detect and monitor nuclear activities\u2014a key part of the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration's nonproliferation mission.\n\nThrough the Nonproliferation Stewardship Program, RPL staff will leverage the debris to understand how to characterize and monitor the movements of special nuclear materials, like uranium and plutonium, through a chemical separation process.\n\n\"This delivery represents a rare and valuable opportunity,\" said Nutt. \"We look forward to realizing the full scientific potential of this material\u2014that's an area where PNNL is especially capable, given our multidisciplinary strengths. The resulting research could help achieve several important goals in service to the nation and go a long way toward providing abundant and reliable energy to the grid allowing for U.S. energy dominance.\"",

      "text": "Breaking down the President's plan to usher in a nuclear renaissance and expand America\u2019s Energy Dominance agenda.\nJune 10, 2025On May 23, President Trump announced four executive orders aimed at reinvigorating America\u2019s nuclear energy industry.\nThe orders lay out a plan to modernize nuclear regulation, streamline nuclear reactor testing, deploy nuclear reactors for national security, and reinvigorate the nuclear industrial base.\nTogether, they represent a bold new strategy for unleashing American energy and continuing our nation\u2019s dominance as the world\u2019s nuclear energy leader.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at some of the key changes outlined in the executive orders:\n1. Speed up Nuclear Reactor Licensing\nPresident Trump wants the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to play a large role in significantly reducing regulatory risks to accelerate nuclear reactor licensing.\nThe executive orders instruct the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to create an expedited pathway to approve reactors that have been safely tested by DOE or the Department of Defense (DoD). Also included is a comprehensive review of the NRC and the establishment of a deadline to evaluate and approve new construction and operation licenses within 18 months.\n2. Add 300 Gigawatts of New U.S. Nuclear Capacity by 2050\nThe United States is the number one producer of nuclear energy in the world, but just three of the nation\u2019s commercial nuclear reactors were completed in the 21st century. President Trump\u2019s executive orders seek to accelerate deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies and expand American nuclear energy capacity from around 100 GW today to 400 GW by 2050. That includes:\n- Working with industry to facilitate 5 gigawatts of power uprates\n- Leveraging the Department\u2019s Loan Programs Office to support reactor restarts and finish partially completed construction projects\n- Improving supply chains\n- Having 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030\n3. Lay the Groundwork for Faster Reactor Testing\nThe executive order proposes that three pilot reactors could be built and tested outside of the national laboratories with the goal of achieving criticality by July 4, 2026, as part of an overarching plan to shorten the length of time it takes to test advanced reactors.\nGoing forward, DOE will revise its regulations and guidance for expedited review and approval of reactor projects under its supervision. The Department will also use all available authorities to eliminate or expedite its environmental reviews for authorizations, permits, approvals, leases, and any other activity requested by an applicant or potential applicant.\n4. Deploy U.S. Reactors for AI and Military Bases\nAdvanced nuclear technology is cited in the executive orders as a pivotal element of President Trump\u2019s national security strategy. He directed DOE to designate AI data centers as critical defense facilities and tasked the Secretary of Energy with utilizing all available legal authorities to site, approve, and authorize deployment of advanced reactors to power them. DOE will lay the groundwork for building and operating an advanced nuclear reactor supporting AI or other critical infrastructure no later than October 2027.\nDoD was also directed to build a nuclear reactor at a domestic military installation to commence operations within the next three years, with DOE providing the technical advice needed for the design, construction, and operation of these military installation reactors. The two agencies were also instructed to coordinate on assessing the feasibility of restarting or repurposing closed nuclear power plants as energy hubs for military microgrid support.\n5. Explore Fuel Recycling and Reprocessing\nThe United States hasn\u2019t recycled or reprocessed commercial spent nuclear fuels since the 1970s, and the President\u2019s executive orders seek to change that. To that end, DOE is instructed to find ways to efficiently transfer spent nuclear fuel from commercial light-water reactors to a government-owned, privately operated reprocessing and recycling facility. The Department will also evaluate reprocessing and recycling of spent nuclear fuel from DOE- and DoD-managed reactors and recommend improvements to those processes to make efficient use of the recovered materials. Additionally, the President ordered the creation of a program to dispose of surplus plutonium by processing and making it available for advanced reactor fuel fabrication and identify ways to permanently dispose of the waste products.\n6. Amp up Domestic Nuclear Fuel Production\nOne of the big takeaways from the executive orders is that President Trump wants to maximize domestic production of nuclear fuel. Building out the U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain will reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on foreign sources of uranium and enable long-term expansion of American nuclear energy. That means a focus on increased mining, enrichment, conversion and deconversion capabilities \u2014 and even recycling and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel \u2014 with assistance from DOE-supported nuclear industry consortia. Of note: DOE will release at least 20 metric tons of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) into a fuel bank for private sector projects powering AI infrastructure at DOE sites.\n7. Bolster the American Nuclear Workforce\nAccording to the executive orders, 60 percent of the nuclear workforce is between the ages of 30 and 60. In order to generate a pipeline of workers to supply the demand for this crucial industry, new emphasis will be placed on increasing participation in nuclear-related apprenticeships and education programs. Nuclear engineering and nuclear energy-related careers will be considered priority areas for federal investment, and DOE is also directed to increase access to R&D infrastructure, workforce, and expertise at the national laboratories for college and university nuclear engineering students.\n8. Assess Spent Nuclear Fuel Management\nSpent nuclear fuel was another key issue highlighted. President Trump tasked the secretaries of energy, defense, and transportation, along with the director of the Office of Management and Budget, to recommend a national policy on spent nuclear fuel management and high-level waste that considers the development and deployment of advanced fuel cycle capabilities to establish a safe, secure, and sustainable long-term fuel cycle.\nAmerica\u2019s Nuclear Renaissance\nWith the pressing need for more American energy to meet the challenges of AI and secure our nation\u2019s energy dominance, President Trump\u2019s vision for a revitalized U.S. nuclear energy industry comes at the perfect time. These executive orders will unshackle our civil nuclear potential and usher in an American nuclear energy renaissance, ensuring abundant, reliable, and affordable energy for the United States. Tell us what you think!\nDr. Michael Goff\nDr. Michael Goff is the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Nuclear Energy. Prior to joining the office as the PDAS, Dr. Goff was on assignment from Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to the Office of Nuclear Energy, where he was serving his third term as senior advisor to the Assistant Secretary. Dr. Goff also served a multi-year assignment as the assistant director for Nuclear Energy/Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President. He has held several management and research positions over more than 30 years at INL and Argonne National Laboratory.\nDr. Goff has more than 70 publications related to the nuclear fuel cycle including separations technology, high-level waste development, and safeguards.
