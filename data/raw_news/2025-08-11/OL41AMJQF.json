President Trump was elected by a historically diverse coalition of Americans from all races, religions, and orientations. As per usual this reality star is out of touch with reality,\" Jackson said.",

      "text": "Former Democratic mayor Rahm Emanuel faced some heat on the \"I\u2019ve Had It\" podcast on Tuesday for dismissing transgender issues as a core party value.\nThe argument began after host Jennifer Welch called on the Democratic Party to fight back more against President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda.\nEmanuel, who has been considered a contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, agreed that Democrats need to stand up for their party but added that they needed to remember the issues that matter to people.\n\"I will just tell you we looked mighty strange having some of these arguments,\" Emanuel said. \"We had the luxury of being a superpower. We're having frivolous arguments about things that didn't matter to people. We became not a party that was built on the culture of acceptance, but a party that became an advocate for certain things that, in my view, were just nuts. And they weren't core.\"\nDEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME 'DISTANT AND DETACHED' FROM AMERICANS, BIDEN OFFICIAL RAHM EMANUEL WARNS\nHe went on to describe how Democrats went \"really south\" on \"family room issues,\" but Welch disagreed \"one hundred million percent\" and attacked him for \"selling out\" to the \"MAGA\" narrative.\n\"The only room we do really well was the bathroom, and that's the smallest room in the house,\" Emanuel remarked.\n\"That is such bulls\u2014t,\" Welch fired back. \"That is total bulls--t. That is buying into the right-wing media narrative, and I'm so sick of Democrats like you selling out and saying this. You know who talks about trans people more than anybody? MAGA. MAGA is the most genital obsessed political party I have ever seen.\"\nEmanuel argued that he had dealt with the issue of bathrooms and marriage equality during his time as Chicago mayor but emphasized that it was not his core issue at the time. Welch went on to claim that Emanuel and other Democrats will continue to lose by not targeting the \"gender-obsessed weirdos.\"\n\"I see politicians that are supposed to be leaders in the Democratic Party buy into the narrative that Republicans have defined us by instead of fighting and saying \u2018You're the weirdos that are obsessed with it. Yeah, we're not going to bully some trans kid,\u2019\" Welch said.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nShe added how people like her need to live with the consequences of being in a red state. Emanuel, who was seen smirking at her comments, joked how \"there is U-Haul if you want to move out.\"\nHe concluded, \"I\u2019ll just tell you this: my view is there's a whole set of issues, and these are side tangential issues. They're not core, and they're not core to what we believe in.\"\nEmanuel also called out his party\u2019s fixation on niche issues like transgender bathroom policies during an episode of \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" in March.\n\"I don't want to hear another word about the locker room, I don't want to hear another word about the bathroom. You better start focusing on the classroom,\" Emanuel said."

      "text": "Immigration: What to know about border security, US immigration policy and more\nImmigration in the United States has become a controversial topic in the political arena. There are several steps one must take to become a U.S. citizen, which are outlined on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. These steps include preparing an application for naturalization, paying fees, completing an interview and taking the oath of allegiance to the United States.\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration prioritized securing the border and cracking down on the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the country. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is the federal agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws. Since beginning his second term in the White House, Trump has worked to initiate the deportation of undocumented immigrants.\nThousands of people gathered in downtown Los Angeles for protest demonstrations over immigration. The scene turned from peaceful to violent as rising unrest prompted police to deploy tear gas. The Los Angeles immigration protests were among other nationwide protests against federal immigration raids conducted by ICE agents. California Gov. has continued to blame Trump for the escalating protests, claiming that they were peaceful demonstrations before the National Guard and Trump's rhetoric intensified the conflict.\n\u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d the nation's newest detention facility for undocumented immigrants, is located in the Florida Everglades and surrounded by swampland teeming with alligators and pythons. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis authorized the construction of the detention center on a 30-square-mile property in the swamplands of Miami-Dade County under an emergency order in June 2025. The property, a former airport, has been outfitted with sturdy tent structures to house 5,000 undocumented immigrants amid the Trump administration's deportation blitz to remove the millions of migrants who entered the country during the Biden administration."

He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."
