  "description": "The man accused of killing a police officer while shooting at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta had previously been reported to police for suicidal thoughts and launched the deadly attack with his father\u2019s weapons to send a message against COVID-19 vaccines, authorities said Tuesday.",
  "content": "The man accused of killing a police officer while shooting at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta on Friday had previously been reported to police for suicidal thoughts and launched the deadly attack with his father\u2019s weapons to send a message against COVID-19 vaccines, authorities said Tuesday.Patrick Joseph White, 30, is suspected of killing DeKalb County Police Department Officer David Rose, 33, shortly before 5 p.m., in an attack that saw him unload around 200 rounds into six CDC buildings. White's driver's license image was released publicly for the first time on Tuesday. Rose, who previously served as a Marine in Afghanistan and joined the DeKalb County Police Department in September 2024, was responding to the scene and died from gunshot wounds. FATHER OF CDC GUNMAN INDICATES POSSIBLE MOTIVATION BEHIND SHOOTINGFive firearms were recovered by law enforcement, mostly long guns, with more than 500 shell casings found at the scene, authorities said at a Tuesday press briefing.Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) Director Chris Hosey said law enforcement made contact with White about mental health warning signs.\"The shooter had no known criminal history. Evidence in this investigation indicates that the shooter had recently verbalized thoughts of suicide, which even led to law enforcement being contacted several weeks prior to the incident,\" Hosey said. He said investigators are getting with the law enforcement that made those contacts to find out the details, but did not provide further information. White died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Hosey said. White, who was from the Atlanta suburb of Kennesaw, had police called on him three different times about being suicidal in the past year, Fox Atlanta reported. In at least one of those calls, White's father told dispatchers that his son had gotten a gun from his father\u2019s locker.SHOOTER NAMED IN CDC HEADQUARTERS ATTACK THAT LEFT GEORGIA POLICE OFFICER DEADIn a September 2024 call, White told police his health had declined after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and that his deteriorating condition had led to suicidal ideation. Officers said White stated he was in pain and had back surgery a decade ago. He claimed taking a gun from his father\u2019s locker was \"only a cry for help.\"After that incident, White was taken to Kennestone Hospital but refused mental health treatment on subsequent calls, per the report. Two other calls took place in April and July of this year.Hosey said that for Friday\u2019s attack, White broke into his father\u2019s safe to get the guns, noting they had been locked away. \"All indications in our investigation was that they were secure and that he forced his way into the safe that contained the weapons,\" said Hosey, adding that the suspect did not have a key to the gun safe: \"He broke into it,\" Hosey said.Hosey said that during a search of his residence, authorities found documents expressing anger towards the COVID-19 vaccine. He said there were no direct threats made in the writing, but it was described as personal manifesto to \"make the public aware\" of his views.\"A search warrant executed at the residence of the shooter revealed written documentation that expressed the shooter's discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations,\" Hosey said.\"I would describe it as more of a public awareness. There was no direct threat... but it was his making the public aware, in his words, of his discontent with the vaccines itself,\" Hosey said in response to a reporter\u2019s follow-up question.Hosey said the materials are being reviewed by certified behavioral profilers and shared with the FBI.White had been stopped by CDC security guards before driving to a pharmacy across the street, where he opened fire from a sidewalk, authorities said. The bullets pierced \"blast-resistant\" windows across the campus, pinning employees down during the barrage. More than 500 shell casings have been recovered from the crime scene, the GBI said.In the aftermath, officials at the CDC are assessing the security of the campus and making sure they notify officials of any new threats.U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. toured the CDC campus on Monday, accompanied by Deputy Secretary Jim O\u2019Neill and CDC Director Susan Monarez, according to a health agency statement. Kennedy also visited the DeKalb County Police Department, and later met privately with the slain officer\u2019s wife.Kenedy recently announced that the CDC will no longer recommend COVID\u201119 vaccinations for healthy children or pregnant individuals and canceled 22 mRNA vaccine development contracts totaling roughly $500 million because he said the data showed that those vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.

      "text": "A total of 22 mRNA vaccine development contracts totaling roughly $500 million have been canceled, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced Tuesday.\nThe mRNA investments were part of the government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of HHS that drives some of the country's most advanced scientific research, such as the development of vaccines, drugs and other tools to fight national health threats. The termination of the 22 BARDA contracts follows a several-weeks-long internal review to determine a path forward when it comes to these investments.\n\"We reviewed the science, listened to the experts, and acted,\" HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday. \"BARDA is terminating 22 mRNA vaccine development investments because the data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu. We\u2019re shifting that funding toward safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"\nRFK JR SCRAPS VACCINE COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN EFFORT TO RESTORE 'PUBLIC TRUST'\nIn a short video explaining the move, Kennedy said the benefits simply do not outweigh the risks associated with mRNA vaccines.\nKennedy went on to point out that not only do mRNA vaccines \u2013 as shown during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 not perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract, but they also do not defend against mutations of the viruses they are intended to go after.\n\"This dynamic drives a phenomena called anogenic shift, meaning that the vaccine paradoxically encourages new mutations and can actually prolong pandemics as the virus constantly mutates to escape the protective effects of the vaccine,\" Kennedy said in the video.\nFor example, the HHS secretary pointed to the omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus, which infected many millions, including those who had been vaccinated against COVID.\n\"A single mutation can make mRNA vaccines ineffective,\" Kebbedy added, noting that the same risks also apply to the flu virus.\nHHS SLAMS 'UNDER-TESTED' MRNA TECHNOLOGY AS TRUMP CUTS MODERNA'S VACCINE FUNDING\nThe move to cancel the mRNA contracts under BARDA will not entirely cancel all mRNA vaccine research done by the government, a source familiar with the move indicated. In addition to allowing some final-stage contracts to run their course to completion in an effort to preserve prior taxpayer investments, ongoing mRNA research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will not be impacted by this latest move.\nMeanwhile, in lieu of the terminated mRNA research and investments at BARDA, HHS will focus on \"safer, broader vaccine strategies,\" Kennedy indicated.\n\"To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we're prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies like whole virus vaccines and novel platforms that don't collapse when viruses mutate,\" Kennedy said in his video explanation about the terminated mRNA investments.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDuring the video, Kennedy reiterated his support for \"safe, effective vaccines\" for any American who wants them.\n\"That's why we're moving beyond the limitations of mRNA for respiratory viruses and investing in better solutions.\""

      "text": "Suspected CDC shooter previously reported to police for suicide attempts\nKENNESAW, Ga. - Police reports show the suspected CDC shooter, Patrick Joseph White, had police called on him three different times about being suicidal in the past year. In at least one of those calls, White's father told dispatchers that White had gotten a gun.\nCDC suspected shooter \"known\" to police\nWhat we know:\nThe calls took place on Sept. 7, 2024; April 25; and July 21. Two of the three calls were made by White's father, Kenneth. One call was made by a crisis line worker who spoke with White.\nAfter the first call, White was taken to Kennestone Hospital for treatment, but he refused help the other two times.\nSept. 7 call: White got a gun\nWhat we know:\nAccording to police records, White's father called 911 around 11:45 p.m. on Sept. 7, 2024. The call was listed as a suicide threat/attempt.\nThe officers who responded said they were advised that White was attempting to get a gun from a locker. As they were responding, the officers were updated that White had gotten a gun but gave it back to his dad.\nOnce they arrived at White's home in Kennesaw, officers said they spoke with the dad and White separately.\nOfficers said White stated he was in pain and had back surgery a decade ago.\n\"He stated that he got the COVID shot and that his health has been bad ever since. (White) stated he did take a gun from his father but it was unloaded and that it was only a cry for help,\" the report said.\nKenneth told officers that White said he wanted to kill himself, according to the report. Officers also said Kenneth told them White had seen numerous doctors who couldn't find anything physically wrong with him.\nKenneth called the Georgia crisis line, and an ambulance picked White up and took him to Kennestone Hospital.\nThe officer wrote, \"I did not observe any signs of aggression from Patrick during our entire encounter.\"\nApril 25 call: White called crisis line\nWhat we know:\nOfficers responded to White's home around 10:15 p.m. on April 25 after White had reportedly called a veterans' crisis line. The crisis line worker told dispatchers that White said he'd been drinking and taking medication.\nWhen officers arrived at the house, they said White told them he had no intention of harming himself, and he called the line \"just to talk to someone.\"\nWhite said he did not want to go to the hospital, and officers said no further action was taken.\nJuly 21 call: White went missing\nWhat we know:\nWhite's father called 911 around 9 a.m. on July 21 to report his son missing after he received calls saying goodbye, according to officers.\nWhen officers spoke with the dad, he told them the message said something along the lines of, \"Take care.\" \"I love you.\" and \"I'll be with you soon.\" Officers said the dad was worried because he hadn't seen him since the night before.\nThe father told officers that White liked to go to parks nearby, and officers said they had other officers patrol the area. White was not seen.\nLater the same day, Kenneth called the police and said his son had returned home.\nCDC shooting takes place\nWhy you should care:\nJust 18 days after the last reported 911 call, police said White opened fire on the CDC campus in Atlanta.\nThe Associated Press reported that White fired over 180 rounds into the campus and broke almost 150 windows.\nCourtesy of GBI\nThe AP also said a law enforcement source told a reporter that police believe White was motivated to commit the shooting because of his belief that the COVID-19 vaccine caused his depression.\nDuring the shooting, DeKalb County police officer David Rose was killed.\nFOX 5 Atlanta photo\nWhite died at a CVS on Emory's campus. Police have not said if he died by suicide or if he was killed.\nAfter the shooting, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said the shooter was known to police.\nWhite suspected CDC shooter\nDig deeper:\nNeighbors who spoke to FOX 5 said White had made comments about the vaccine to them before, but that he was mostly quiet and did yard work around his neighborhood.\nThe GBI has not released a photograph of White and FOX 5 has found no photos we can confirm are White.\nNo red flag law in Georgia\nDig deeper:\nSeveral states across the U.S. have what\u2019s known as a \"red flag law,\" which allows a judge to temporarily remove someone\u2019s access to guns if they are found to be a danger to themselves or others.\nThe rules vary by state on who can petition for a red flag hearing. In California, family members, employers, and co-workers can file a petition. In Florida, only law enforcement can.\nGeorgia does not have a red flag law, meaning the reports of issues in this case could not have prevented White from possessing or purchasing a gun.\nThe Source: Information in this article came from police reports given to FOX 5 by Cobb County police and past reporting by FOX 5 News, which you can find linked throughout the story."

      "text": "The man suspected of gunning down a police officer near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, on Friday has been named as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White.\nWhite, 30, of Kennesaw, Georgia, is suspected of killing DeKalb County Police Department Officer David Rose, 33, shortly before 5 p.m., the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said in an update on Saturday.\nThe deadly incident unfolded when White opened fire in front of the CDC campus, unleashing a barrage of bullets that pierced multiple windows.\nA GBI image released Saturday showed dozens of shell casings scattered across the pavement.\nPOLICE OFFICER KILLED AFTER SHOOTING NEAR CDC HEADQUARTERS, EMORY UNIVERSITY IN ATLANTA\nAt least four CDC buildings were hit, Director Susan Monarez said in a post on X. Images shared by employees showed multiple agency buildings with bullet-pocked windows, underscoring the breadth of the damage to a site where thousands of scientists and staff work on critical disease research.\nWhen officers responded to the location, they found Rose critically wounded and heard additional gunfire coming from a nearby CVS pharmacy. Rose was rushed to Emory University Hospital on Clifton Road where he died from his injuries.\nOfficers entered a nearby pharmacy and located the shooter on the second floor with at least one gunshot wound. Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said it was not clear if the wound came from police gunfire or if it was self-inflicted.\nThe motive for the shooting is not known.\nWithout naming White Friday night, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens described him as a \"known person that may have, some interest in certain things.\"\nThe shooting took place on Clifton Rd. near the Emory University campus, which also houses a daycare with more than 90 children in its care. None of them were harmed.\nSHOOTING AT GEORGIA'S FORT STEWART INJURES 5 SOLDIERS; SUSPECT IN CUSTODY\nThe GBI is now leading the investigation and the FBI's Atlanta office said it is also assisting. The GBI said it is collecting evidence and conducting interviews as part of its investigation, which it said will take \"an extended period of time.\"\nOfficer Rose joined the DeKalb County Police Department in September 2024, graduated from the police academy in March and had quickly earned a reputation for dedication and professionalism, the department said in a statement. He previously served as a Marine in Afghanistan.\nHe is survived by his pregnant wife and two children, police said.\nInterim Police Chief Greg Padrick said Rose was committed to serving the community.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"At this time we\u2019re asking for the community\u2019s prayers for his family, his friends, his loved ones and the entire DeKalb County Police Department family,\" he said in a statement Friday.\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp said his family is \"mourning today's tragic loss of Officer David Rose.\"\n\"His service and memory will not be forgotten by a grateful state, and his loved ones and fellow @DeKalbCountyPD officers will remain in our hearts and prayers as they grieve his passing and this painful day,\" Kemp wrote on X.\nFox News' Alexandra Koch, Sophia Compton, Louis Casiano and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
